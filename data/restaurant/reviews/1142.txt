We got the hint
And this was a Tuesday evening!! If I'm spending $35 for a piece of fish, I feel like I should at least have five minutes to digest
DO NOT bring anyone that you are trying to impress
You will just leave embarassed
And poor!
Seated early at our request
The chedder rolls are amazing! We had the pink snapper and it was amazing as well
Also tried the hen of the woods mushrooms - very good
Served cotton candy for dessert - such a nice surprise
A must try!
You would think a restaurant that accepts reservations, would know what it means
After arriving we were told to wait at the bar, where there wasn't an inch of space so we remained in the tiny area near the coat check
45 minutes later, after being told it would be soon, your table is getting cleared away, and they're paying the bill now, we opted to give our dining dollars to a more worthy establishment
The food? Couldn't tell you
The staff: arrogant and dishonest
Couldn't image what would ever get me into any of the BLT restaurants after that experience
What a HUGE disappointment
My party of 5 had a reservation for 8:45 on Saturday
We arrived to a chaotic bar with no place to sit, and people packed in to a claustrophobic density
We were told that our table would be ready shortly
We waited and waited and waited and waited
And then we waited
On the third inquiry, when we were told (again) that our table would soon be ready, we decided that if this was any indication of how the evening would go, WE would go
We picked up our coats and politely told them we were leaving, and they could not have cared less
Reservations mean nothing at this restaurant
It might be hot, but New Yorkers deserver better service
What an ingenious concept: upscale restaurant upstairs, casual joint downstairs--both serving up fish, literally, brought right in from the sea
We had intentions to eat upstairs (warning: primarily whole fish carved up at the table) but after throwing back the 9 dollar Cote Du Rhone at the bar (with salt and vinegar kettle chips), we ate downstairs
The free garlic loaf smothered in chedder cheese was a nice touch
The stripped bass was excellent, but the Special Monkfish with capers, mushrooms, and smashed potatoes was heavenly
The white wine reduction was yummmy
Oh, the music downstairs rocks--everything from Bon Jovi to Talking Heads
Went the other night and it was wonderful
Was seated extremely quickly and the food was amazing! Staff was friendly and helpful with choices
Would def
go back in the future
I was a little nervous about trying BLT Fish after reading about some of the horrible experiences
However, we had a very nice meal and the service was great
We were seated promptly, and the sommelier helped us pick a bottle of wine which was excellent
Everything went smoothly until entree time when they brought me the wrong meal
Our watier apologized profusely, saying he had hit the wrong button on the computer screen
They rushed out the correct item, and brought us free dessert
It was a lovely evening
Upon arrival we were told the wait would be 45min
But after over 1hr we inquired again, was told we'd be seated in an additional 15min
This turned into an additional 45min, when we were so angry that we'd gone up to ask again
This is when the host apologized profusely for somehow missing my name
Then the hostess asked accusingly if we even had our name on the wait list, which by that point (1
5hours of waiting) was enough to make me scream
They forgot to bring our appetizers and our entrees were cold
We weren't offered a complimentary drink or dessert to make up for this fiasco of a night
They rushed us out with the bill even though by then, no one was on line for a table anymore
Please save your time and $$$
This place is not worth it
Loved this place, we went to the shack on the first floor to get the down to earth and better priced menu
It was great
good drinks, fresh seafood and good service
I had a great time here
Highly recommend to seafood lovers
This place is fantastic
The food is absolutely delicious, and the staff is accomodating, attentive, and generous
I would recommend this place to anybody
The wait was inexcusable at one hour, the fish was mediocre at best, and the side dishes were inedible due to oversalting
They should keep the cotton candy and improve the food and service
There is no excuse - I don't care how new the place or how hot - there is no excuse for having to wait one hour on a reservation you not only had to make a month in advance, but you had to confirm two days in advance
The incompetent hosts, to add insult to injury, flat out lie - It will only be a few moments Oh, your table is just finishing up - to keep you there
Yes, the fish is great and the pink snapper - an impossible to find treat - is fabulous
The wait staff is also to be commended for their superior service and knowledge
But I would not recommend going under any circumstances, not until the front of house gets its act together and catches up with the kitchen, which is doing a great job
All in all, a fabulous flop
Went there last night - had an 8:15 reservation for the upstairs dinning room for four and didnt get seated until 9:00 p
m
We waited reluctantly since we had out of town guests
The maitre d clearly does not know what he is doing as he was completely disinterested in making sure our party would look forward to the experience and he claimed no responsibility for keeping us waiting for our reservation
Obviously, I refused to pay for the drinks we had at the bar
Food, while good, is over-rated and very overpriced
My suggestion would be if you absolutely feel the need to frequent this establishment stay downstairs in the casual dining area, have a couple of drinks with some appetizers and go to another establishment where youll get a better bang for your buck
I have to say I was pretty worried when I read the reviews about the service, but I have to say most of the bad experiences were probably due to the growing pains of a new restaurant
They definitely seem to have it together now
We had to be in and out in an hour and a half - we let them know when we got there and everything was very timely and accomidating
We never had trouble getting a waiter's attention
The food of course was excellent (we were upstairs) - the swordfish was some of the best I've ever tasted
I can't recommend this place highly enough now that service has improved
I had the pleasure to eat at BLT Fish with my girlfriend last sunday
The service and the food was excellent, especially the lobster roll
The whole experience was great
Read a glowing review in one of the NY rags and took a couple of clients last week, May 4
Like the reviewer before me, we ran 20 minutes late and lost our reservation to the upstairs dining area, which is where you want to be with clients, right? So, in good humor we sat in the much more casual downstairs
Had a wonderful server who picked up on the fact we were on an expense account and made sure we had our every need met
End all be all, however, the food is just, well, average seafood! I've done several truly spectacular NY seafood restaurants, and this is not one of them
One client ordered the 3-pound lobster, and it was $30 A POUND
A $90 lobster doesn't necessarily taste better; I can tell you that in all confidence
This place is definitely enjoying its hype -- for now
I just had lunch at BLT Fish and couldn't get back quick enough to write this review
We waited over an hour for our main courses - a hamburger and a lobster roll - even after prodding the server (he never put the order in, and then when he did claimed there were 'printer problems' so the kitchen never got it)
When the $24 lobster roll finally arrived, it had about 1/4 cup worth of lobster salad in the sandwich
I had to ask the server if this was how it normally came (perhaps they were running low since it was late lunch at this point) and he answered in the affirmative
He offered us a free dessert to make up for it, knowing that we had to leave
So we got back to the office late and still hungry
TERRIBLE and a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!

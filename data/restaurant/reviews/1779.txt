The pizza was thin but the waiter tells you that
It's not a surprise
I had the pasta with the ragu and it was very tasty
I had a great glass of wine but I don't remember what it was
The manager suggested I try it
It was some new rose they had just gotten in
I would definitley go back
As for Otto
I use to go there but the food and service has really gone down
Maybe all their attention is on Del Posto or something
Anyway
go to Gonzo
It's really good
I have to agree with the naysayers on this one
We went hoping to try the grilled pizza, which was well-topped, but the crust is really no more than a scorched tortilla
The menu has a gauche, if not insulting, note that says there is a $20 per person food minimum
Ridiculous, particularly if you're a vegetarianyou'd have to order two dinners apiece
So, in addition to the pizza, we were obliged to order the lasagne, which was a smoldering, overcooked, overcreamed pile
Their hummus appetizer was chunky, gritty, and pastythe worst thing on the table
The wines on their list are unremarkable, but might be better were they cellered correctlyours was literally served at about 85 degrees
We had a way better time at Enoteca Otto
Funny that
Otto gets reamed on the Citysearch reviews, while Gonzo is a darling here
Just goes to show you that opinions are like

well, you know the rest
I went to Gonzo tonight with a friend, and my friend got clam chowder, I got the house salad, and we split a margherita pizza
The salad was really nice
they had a couple herbs and spices in the balsalmic that made the dressing really tasty
The pizza was REALLY REALLY thin
If you think you've had thin crust pizza before, this will totally change your mind
The sauce and cheese on the pizza were both excellent (very robust flavors, chunky sauce, quite yummy), but the crust tastes a little too wafer-y for me
good, but not my favorite ever
It is extremely thin and crispy, and has that slightly charred taste on the bottom (oh, and did I mention that it's REALLY thin?) But it's a nice restaurant, the service was good, and the food was tasty
I wouldn't go rushing back, but it was a nice dinner
I was at Gonzo's on Sunday and I was expecting it to be quiet but it was pretty busy
We had the Watermelon (yes, watermelon) Pizza and it was fabulous! All the food was great
I had the Spaghetti with Clam Sauce and my friend had the Corn Salad
We were so happy!!! The prosecco they serve by the glass was cooling and our server Carl was so friendly
I can't wait to go back
I LOVE THIS PLACE
IT'S GOT A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD VIBE AND THE FOOD IS OUT OF THIS WORLD! THE QUAIL IS DELICIOUS AND THE CORN MASH POTATO PIZZA IS AMAZING
THE STAFF IS REALLY FRIENDLY AND I THINK THAT THE WINE LIST IS REALLY GREAT
NOT ALL ITALIAN PLACES HAVE SUCH A SELECTION OF WELL PRICED DELICIOUS ITALIAN WINES
I TRIED THE ROSE ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGER AND THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY REFRESHING
I WOULDN'T HAVE TRIED IT UNLESS SHE SUGGESTED IT AND IT WAS LOVELY
I WILL DEFINITELY BE TELLING ALL MY FREINDS ABOUT THIS PLACE!!!
The pizzas are flavorful - grilling makes them crisp and light
Sadly I've been wine tasting there three times and cannot find a single bottle that is drinkable
I've resorted to drinking Hoegarden at Gonzo
The first visit we sat at the bar and tasted 3 whites and 3 reds
While I appreciate fine wines, due to my budget regularly drink cheap wine
I am not that picky, but each selection was worse than the last
Second and third trips we tried 3 red wines - no matter what price range they all burned the palate: thin, dusty, zero finish - none acceptable
I am accustomed to drinking delicious $10 reds, table wines, at home and in other Italian restaurants like Gradisca which always features very satisfying, inexpensive wines
I do not understand why Gonzo cannot find similar
Very frustrating b/c we live two blocks away and love the food
I initially determined that I would never return to Gonzo again and had my review all planned out based on my first thirty minutes in the restaurant
We waited for thirty minutes for our table, and after inquiring once about the status, we were rudely confronted by the hostess
However, the hostess must have recognized the error of her ways because we were treated like royalty after that point (a bottle of wine and two desserts on the house)
The food was very good - any of the pizzas would be an excellent choice
The asparagus appetizer with the fried egg was nice
Overall, it was very good food for the price and is a good location for larger groups
The restaurant more than compensated for their initial blunders, and we certainly be returning for another meal soon
Ive been to Gonzo several times
Each time Ive been there the service has been fantastic
The owners Vincent Scotto Donna Scotto always make a point of visiting our table throughout the meal to see if everything is to our liking
During October they serve a pumpkin pizza which I look forward to every year
The other day a had the Sauted Jumbo Shrimp which was absolutely delicious
I have recommended this restaurant to all my friends
Gonzo is my favorite Restaurant in Manhattan, Vincent Scotta has to be the No
1 chef in the world, his grilled pizzas are out of this world, he makes the best caesar salads [my favorite], the entrees are excellent not to mention the delicious desserts
Of course Gonzo has a great wine list which compliments their Tuscany style Restaurant
You have to try it
In a neighborhood with a gazillion delicious, authentic Italian restaurants, there is no reason to go to this one
The only decent item on the menu is the pizza, but save your money and get it at the local pizza shop
The olives were too salty, the cheese plate was uninventive and forgettable, the wine list was paltry and overpriced, and the service was not helpful
Go to Otto, Po, or Lupa for similar prices and far better food
Went to Gonzo on a Friday night
Was able to get a table for 2 within a half hour
The hostesses were very gracious and did their best to get us a table
While waiting we got really hungry and eyed the Tuscan Steak on the menu
We had to try it, even though steak was not what we thought we should be ordering in an Italian restaurant
The staff was really running around
The manager came up to our table twice
Once to ask if we needed any help with the wine list
She suggested a great Barbara (I don;t know if that was it)
But it was wow! and went great with the steak which was a masterpiece! The best steak in New York
And I would definitley go back to Gonzo just for that but I think that I should try something more Italian next time
I went to Gonzo last night with a group of coworkers and it was GREAT! The corn mashed potato pizza was amazing! I had the pasta with the Lobster Ragu and it was so good that if I wasn't so full, I would have had another! The manager was so welcoming
She came around to our table and even offered to help us with our wine selection and she helped us pick out 2 superb wines
I will definitely go back!
If you've never been to Gonzo, get there fast
The food's unbelievably great
I can't say enough about the Grilled Pizzas
The pastas and entrees are wonderful
They boast one of the Best Caesar Salads in town
They also have an extensive wine list that they serve by the glass, quatino (carafe) and bottle
Staff and owners are extremely friendly and the atmosphere is very comfortable
One other thing, you'll never leave Gonzo hungry

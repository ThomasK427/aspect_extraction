We have tried the chicken/sausage chili, and I have to admit that it is probably the best chili I have ever eaten at a restaurant (my secrect recipe is better though)
If you are having a Mac Attack, skip McDonalds and try this place out, you will not regret it!
What a healthy treat! The burger has an all natural taste
But if you're used to the fake artificial taste of the Big Mac, Whopper, etc
you might not appreciate the taste of this beef, with no added hormones, antibiotics
or artificial flavors/MSG
They are made right in front of you and they have a wide variety of tasty sauces
The bacon and the cheese were real too!!!! And the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh too!!!! However, I have learned that if you don't want your burgers to be red on the inside, you have to ask for a well done burger
My only disappointment was that the second time I went, they didn't have the big delicious homemade onion rings anymore
The girl at the counter had no idea of when they would have them back
What happened there? I settled for the natural tasty fries
but I want the O-rings back!!!!
For a quick tasty burger, its the place to go
The burgers are made right in front of you to your specs, and there are about 10 different self serve sauces to choose from
The fries are also awesome
Fun concept, great burgers (we tried the regular seattle style and a vegetarian veggie burger), nice topping selections too
We really enjoyed our big deal combos and would definitely return to try the tasty sounding fruit smoothies
This place leaves so much to be desired it is ridiculous
First of all I waited way too long for what turned out to be a vastly under-cooked burger
I, however, remained hopeful
Alas, the burger was tasteless, and I got portabello mushrooms and onions on it and dowsed it in sauce
They are sloppy, unprepared and unorganized, I will never step foot into that place ever again, and I strongly admonish others not to as well
TRUST ME
The Scene Hidden from the adjoining Bar Room by a wall of frosted glass, the dining room is an airy, light-filled expanse overlooking the sculpture garden
Sleek leather banquettes and chairs by a collection of Danish modernist designers provide clean lines and understated luxury; tabletops set with Bernardaud china and Robbe and Berking silverware enhance the impression
Service is excellent, particularly the personable wine director, Stephane Colling
The Food Chef Gabriel Kreuther's French-New American cooking is simply outstanding
He's having fun, tarting up hamachi tuna with a buttery grapefruit sauce and spice crust, and paving buttery cod with thin discs of chorizo, then upping the smoky ante with a dash of harissa oil
Kreuther's precision and palate ensure that even ubiquitous luxury ingredients are renewed: his Gewurztraminer-poached foie gras with fruit chutney is utter perfection
Desserts hold up their end of the bargain, especially the zesty, vibrant passion fruit ravioli
The first time I went to the Modern, my friend and I indulged ourselves in not 5, not 6, but 10 courses
It was probably the best 3 hours I've ever experienced
My favorites: warm veal with goat cheese (just melts in your mouth), the gnocchi with crab meat, and for dessert - the beignets are unbelievable
I definitely recommend getting a couple of the appetizers instead of the third courses - they are great also, but nowhere near as delicious as the first and second courses
LOVE this place, but have only eaten in the area closest to the entrance, and I've heard the menu by the windows is even more fantastic
After a drink at the very atmospheric but classic bar we had dinner in the dining room
The food was excellent and innovative - from appetizer to dessert to drinks - both of ours (my fiancee's and mine) menu choices - just perfect
Admittedly, the modern style is not everybody's style - but definitely one of the most stylish high-end restaurant that New York needed
That's the place to go in New York!
I like Danny Meyer
I like the MoMA
So I really wanted to like The Modern
I was surprised when I walked down the white-lit entranceway and entered what looked like, to me, a modern, high-tech cafeteria that looked like a leftover set from Kubrick's 2001
This is not a place for a romantic date
Clean and sterile
Pleasant
There's an enormous bar with bar seating in front and semi-private dining behind that
Since I wanted to try a few different items (the formal dining room is prix fixe-only) I sat in the bar room
I had 6 dishes
Two: the octopus and the gnocchi were *very* good
Three were interesting: Arctic char tartare, scallops and salmon
One was a miss: Crispy tuna
Although the portions are small, my date and I were quite full after the meal and drinks
The service was very good
The meal, with 3 drinks ($35) was $144
I would certainly stop back and sit at the bar after a long day at the Museum, but I don't think I would otherwise return for a meal
The food was very good, but not great
I would go back and have drinks and appetizers and do a little people watching if I had too
this place is soooo amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I absolutely love the beignets for desert!! YUMMY!
For this amount of money, I expect very good food or very good service
preferably both
The Modern provides neither
The restaurant is chaotic, service is rude and arrogant, my monkfish was rubbery and flavorless, and they take small portions to a new demension
The bar scene, though, is cool
Great vibe
This is a unique menu and has a variety of offerings
My husband and I went there for restaurant week (the Bar Room) and ended up ordering from the main menu since there were so many things we wanted to try - squid, artic char tartare, salmon
mmmmm! They were all good as was the service
A classic Meyers experience and would go back
The main dining room looks lovely and may be more suitable for a quieter dining experience since the Bar Room is named appropriately
The Modern, located in MOMA is a restaurant that lived up to my expectations
I expected elegant dining in a cool, modern setting and it was exactly that
I made reservations for Restaurant Week and was seated in the Bar Room but decided to forego the constraints of the limited Restaurant Week menu as prices were comparable
Things to try: Duck Confit, Charred Octupus and Beignets are all scrumptious
They have a decent wine list however, wines by the glass are slighty on the high side
Hosts were pleasant, service was great otherwise but, our waiter was highly condescending which I found very irritating
Took my finance tonight for her birthday
For a pricey meal, you expect the highest level of service
Simple things really: never having to ask for bread, water always filled, a staff on-tap at every turn
While our waiter was focused, he had no support
Dinner on this level should be an event, this was not
The space was cold, the food salty and over-engineered
Food that was trying too hard
Suggestion: try the bar, they have a full menu
Unless you're there for a business dinner or have a need to wear a dinner jacket, it has a much more a NYC vibe
I don't know how Danny Meyer does it, but he managed to create yet another perfect restaurant
We had dinner at the bar on New Year's eve
It was a 3 hour 45 minute experience of amazing, imaginative food, great drinks and superb, understated service
The setting is, as it should, Modern yet cozy and welcoming
We were never rushed, and the waitstaff seemed to be able to read our minds
And the food
the mushroom soup with toasted chorizo ravioli is amazing, and the scallop/oxtail combo was a revelation
What a beautiful room with a glass wall looking out onto the garden
It's very spacious and the tables and chairs are comfortable and easy on the eyes
Cool bathrooms
The skate was moist and delicious
The coffe was OK, but the chocolates were excellent
We were greeted graciously and our waitress was a calm professional
I'm sorry, but I just have nothing bad to say about the place
Went there for a birthday - The food was fabulous - We sat in the Bar Room - not the main dining room - It is actually much nicer than the picture even shows on their website! We were pleasantly surprised

You can't beat a Shake Shack burger in the park during warm weather
Sit under a canopy of trees while digging into that delicious juicy thang and its crispy crinkle-cut fries
As my friend says, this is the sort of food that just makes you laugh while you're eating it
I'd pay more for a meal than I do, but the decent price makes this place that much more right
I usually don't splurge on desserts, but the ice cream (concretes) took me by surprise--a great combination of soft serve and ice cream, with addictive add-ins
I have a long term-life commitment to hot dogs, and every which way they're served - anywhere - however, not here
Don't stink up the park, and please, at least try to pretend something healthy is being served
We have to walk around Central Park worrying about pretzels and boiled hot dogs should a hunger pang strike (truly wilderness compared to Madison Square Park), SHAME ON YOU NYC - at least let people walk on the grass before you introduce fat injectioning shacks in the parks
Bring your appetite, and ensure that you have lots of time
This is one NYC lunch experience that is not to be missed! The burgers are amazing, and the rest of the food is fairly great
Wow! What a find! Quite a unique NYC eatery that is pretty much a concession stand in Madison Square Park with a separate outdoor area for dining
Long lines but worth it
Once you order, you get a # and wait for your food to be made
I had a few of the special shack burgers, cheese fries and a Chicago Dog
The burger is the best I've had in NYC oozing with juice, the special sauce and a great cut of meat
Not a big burger, so you may need a few or order the double or triple burgers
Cheese fries were crispy, Chicago Dog was excellent also
Friendly service, good value
I'll have to try their concretes (mixed shakes) next time though!
My whole suite travels from Columbia Univ
to Madison Square Park just for the burgers there-- so good and the staff is super sweet! Can't beat the price or the quality! Highly recommend this place!!!
Fantastic burger!!! Perfectly cooked and delicious!!! I'll be back when the weather warms up!!! The shakes are wonderfull as well!
I have heard about this place for a long time and finally made it over to the Shake Shack last week
I braved the blustery weather and the chances of a huge line, but luckily there was no line (probably because we went right before it closed for the night) and the cold might've kept everyone away
The doubleshack burger was amazing, cooked just right with all the fixings, and the custard was delicious
I am already planning on going again really soon
Can't emphasize the waiting part enough since Shake Shack has some of the longest lines I've seen in an outside establishment
The service is rushed and cash only, so get your order right when its your turn in line
The wait in line can be as much as 45 minutes to an hour long, during Summer and lunch time
It''ll be difficult to find a place to sit as they have limited seating
What makes up for it is the prices and the taste of their food
You'd be amazed at how delicious a simple shake shack burger can be, given that it looks like an ordinary burger with some sauce and extra stuff on it
Its worth the wait at times, but don't come in with high expectations
just a lot of patience
Good things come to those who wait
Best burger I've eaten in NYC
Worth the long wait
No wait during off peak hours
Burgers are cooked medium so it's moist and not overcooked and charred like most places
The burgers are perfect size not falling all over the place
Despite what anyone tells you, bigger burgers don't mean better burgers
If you want a big nasty sloppy burger go to Jackson Hole, but if you want the real deal quality burger go to Shake Shack!
I got shack burger which was probably a bit larger than a McDonalds burger
4 whole ounces
it wasnt that special although it was tasty, it left me wanting more
It came with one slice of flimsy lettuce, two really small tomato slices, and cheese, all on a toasted bun which was pretty thin
The fries really made up for the lack of burgerness
Crinkle cut, salty, crispy, delicious
Go here for the ice cream
It's a frozen custard and soft serve mix and is pretty damn awesome
I had a black and white shake which was quality
Everyone loves the concrete which is like a blizzard
Good prices
Shake fries and burger all for 10 bucks
I tried the Shake Shack on an impulse and was completely blown away by how good the food was
On the outside, it looks like a generic concession stand at a baseball or football stadium, but the food tastes like it came out of a gourmet restaurant
It's not the biggest burger in the city, but it's definitely the best-tasting
The meat is so smooth and has the perfect blend of being slightly crisp on the outside and being soft and juicy on the inside
A couple of hints: 1) avoid going during peak lunch and dinner hours - everything is made fresh so it takes time, 2) definitely try their Concrete desert - my favorite is chocolate with bananas and hot fudge mixed in
The shake shack had the best burgers! It is definately a wait to get the burgers as there is always a line, but it is so worth it
They use top quality beef to make their burgers
It might be a good idea to go on a cooler day because the only tables are those outdoors in the park
if i hear one more thing about corner bistro burgers being the best- granted, i haven't been there yet, but that's besides the point
burgers truly can't get better than this
this guy's set the bar to a new place and then he's exceeded that
i think he's using ground brisket and sirloin which gives it juiciness and flavor
even this shake shack sauce is good
i eat two of them at a time, arrive around 11am if poss to beat the line
the concretes/shakes/custards are good but i always feel too full when i stray from just the burger
the fries are the weak link - those frozen crinkle cut jobs
not worth the stomach space
good luck - this place totally rules!
The food is awesome and if you are waiting in line and someone asks you if the food is good enough to wait 45 minutes for
you can say definitely!
i have never been a burger lover
they tend to be boring to me, until i took some advise from a friend and wend to the shake shack one sunday afternoon
i get it now
a good burger can be so satisfying
and these are not so huge that you feel like you need medical assistance afterward! and they also have a perfect selection of beverages
Nice place in the middle of Madison Park with peacefull surroundings
If you're in the area, don't hesitate to get yourself a burger
The Shack Burger has a great taste to it and the fries are thin and crispy
For the same money, its much better then the McDonalds/Wendys across the street
I have not had such a poor dining experience in my 15 years living in the neighborhood
I heard about the restaurant from a neighbor and so invited friends to meet us there for dinner on a Monday night
There were only 3 other tables, so yes - the wait was short for a table
But at 8:00, the waiter informed us that he was out of three of the appetizers and four of the entrees
How can you be OUT on a Monday night at 8:00? If you're out of salmon - go buy some! The menu is small, so if they're aren't going to keep things stocked, then they should print a nightly menu
To top it off, they were also OUT of the wine by the glass I wanted, leaving only the $10 a glass option available
I can't believe we stayed, but we did
The bread was served, one razor thin slice on our bread plate, by the waiter
There was not an offer for more
My husband enjoyed the kobe beef burger, but the other dishes were not all that special
I ordered the only other fish option on the menu, can't remember what it was - started with a B and had a z in it
It was dry - VERY dry
The orzo past under the fish was swimming in oil and none of the ingredients was as special as other writers have posted
The bad didn't end with dessert
And how often have you had bad dessert??? My capaccino was cold and served in an espresso cup
The peach cobbler was dense with only a trace of peaches - mostly bisquick tasting heavy cake
The opera cake the waiter raved about looked like it was cut from the cake with science equipment to make it as thin and small as possible

Understandable, however when the customer asks for grated cheese on their pasta with seafood dish and the owner refuses
somethings wrong!!!
Il Bagatto epitimizes what makes the East Village so unique: it's funky yet warm decor, cool vibe and sensible prices
We were seated almost immediately
While I say this restaurant is good, I wouldn't vere too much from the basics
look at the pirate chef operation (ala Bourdain's book) in the kitchen and you will understand
That being said, the penne a la vodka-amazing, the calamari appetizer with portabellos
not so much
While romantic, don't get lost in each others eyes for too long, you will be foreced up for the next couple to savor a brief respite in this bit of Lower East Side culture and darn good food
the big downside to this restaurant is that it is always crowded
but it is crowded for a reason! the food is excellent (especially the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola) and the atmosphere is cozy and nice
the dj downstairs is a plus too
I've been to Il Bagatto's a couple of times and the food is great! The staff is friendly and I love the ambiance
The food is good and inexpensive
Unfortunately there is no parking - good luck finding parking in the area
Tried it once and definetely no more
Food is very bland and generic (at least its cheap)
Service was horrible
a must, just dont be scared of the location
two italian women that bring all the TLC of italian cooking right to your table at cheap prices
just dont stay too long or they will ask you to leave
just remember they go away for the month of august back to italy
you will soon find your self there alot but cash only
no exceptions
The owner and the staff will not bring cheese for the fish pasta! What a joke - the customer should get what they want - instead of eating fish pasta like you are in Rome - these people are not the typical Italians
Apparently, the host or manager of this restaurant does not believe in treating customers courteously
Recently, my friends and I gathered at Il Bagatto for a small birthday get together, and we were told by the host that the wait would be 30 minutes
After about 45 minutes, I went to ask the host how much longer the wait would be and he told us our table should be ready soon
Twenty minutes later, I went to ask the host again and he told me that he didn't appreciate me asking him how long the wait would be
He then had the audacity to tell me that 'they were not a traditional restaurant' and that I should expect this at this 'type' of restaurant
Yes, they are not a typical restaurant because most establishments believe in customer service
Last night my boyfriend and I had the worst restaurant experience either one of us has ever had
It was our third anniversary, we had spent the day hiking, were starving, and asked our waiter if we could order some bread
He explained they prefer not to give customers bread until they've received appetizers
Our blood sugar rapidly depleting, we asked if he could just see if he could make an exception
He left, then returned to the table saying that the manager refused
My boyfriend politely complained, and within minutes we were greeted by the owner/manager not with courtesy, certainly not with bread, but with outrage
He proceeded to yell at my boyfriend and personally insult him
All for a piece of bread
This man ruined our anniversary dinner and our once very high opinion of his restaurant
I refuse to ever patronize it again
This place is wonderful
Cozy, yet romantic
The food is delicious and not pricy at all
I can't wait to go back there again!
TRULY HORRIBLE
First, they demand that you be there by your reservation time
Then they make you wait for an hour or more in the bar so you'll spend money on drinks
After we waited forever for a table, the four of us were sat at a table big enough for two people
I walked out on this place before the waiter made it to the table
I will NEVER go NEAR this place again
It is a JOKE
There are so many GOOD restaurants to go to
Don't go here
You'll regret it
Great little place
After reading some of the reviews i was worried about going there - no need to
good food at great prices, the lounge downstairs was great and the service was attentive
Highly worth the trip down there
I went there last night for the first time
We didn't have to wait more than a beer time (elapsed time it takes to drink a Red Stripe)
We sat down on one of the comfortable couches that are in the basement
Overall the night was good
Music was not my type, but low enough to relax
My girlfriend asked the bartender what kind of wine they had and since she couldn't hear she leaned on the bar to get closer to him and he made a face and told her not to get near him
Food was good, nothing really special, but the prices were fair
I do recommend the gnocchis
The waiter was funny and helpful
I do recommend this place if you have patience and can take a joke
Besides I hate eating while listening to the conversation of some loud idiot next table

The Scene Moustache operates on a simple philosophy: Serve savory, affordable Middle Eastern food in a cozy, urbane setting--and keep that puffed-up, fresh-out-of-the-oven pita coming to the table
During warmer months, guests can grab a table in the lovely garden out back
The only drawback is the service, which suffers noticeably during peak hours
The Food Start off with a mix of salads (babaganouj, chick pea-spinach-and-tomato, etc
) and move on to a sandwich, sliced leg of lamb or merguez sausage wrapped in a pita, or try a "pitza" for one
i wouldn't visit mr
moustache if i had a subsequent appointment to keep, as the wait staff seems often frazzled and surprised that you might require some additional service performed, like say the delivery of the check
but if you can operate with that limitation, the food has a good taste and comes at a nice price point

I had lunch here yesterday and ordered the ouzie
It was the best lunch I have had in a long time
fluffy fresh pastry filled with rice vegetables and chicken
I have been here many times and always loved it
Now after eating this I will have to come back way more often
This part of 10th st has unexpectedly become my favorite east village block
I used to eat felafel made with regular pita bread
the kind they serve at street stands and such
Moustache makes their own fresh pita for the felafel
Its fantastic
I can't eat the other kind anymore
I'm spoiled
So, while its an exaggeration to say that a restaurant changed your life
this one really did change my eating habits forever
The pitas are amazingly fresh, and their appetizers are delicious
Customer service is a little slow
If you're looking for a down to earth place, no frills, great food, reasonably priced - this is the place to go
Have been to Moustache many many times with friends and my wife and it has never failed to thrill me
The ambience in the front of the restaurant is dark and cool with candles placed on bronze colored metallic tables at night, exposed brick, a big old mirror, wooden exterior with lots of glass windows and wood floors

i was expecting outstanding food
i didn't get it
the food was average
plus, the service was awful! i ordered desert and it never came
it was not romantic and it was loud and had to wait forever for a table
i wil not return or recommend it to my friends
I've been a fan of Pastis for years it never fails to succeed in producing wonderfully friendly, knowledgeable servers (I miss Evan!) and top-notch French bistro fare
The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime
This is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both A-listers and people walking in off the street
Enjoy!
My wife and I were entertaining visitors, another couple, with their first visit to Pastis - and we had a dreadful time, seated at one of the tables near the bar, among the rudest of young-ish to middle-aged New Yorkers (you know the kind!)
We were jostled and verbally abused as we ate
There was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at Pastis
We were pleasantly greeted
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot
The food was very well prepared
The service was ok
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner
Too crowded
Bad service--indifferent waiters
food is good but not worth the money
My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended
I loved it
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe
The food was really good, I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever
Service was hurried, but friendly
The fries are yummy
While you wait you can have a drink in a crowded (not much) bar with plenty of potencial friends! Continues over night with a short, but flavoured menu
try the Pasti's steak!! And never forget to have a look to the main door you never know who might be entering at that moment!!
Pretentious? No way
Pastis is a terrific place for friends to gather and mingle
The bustling energy and vibe of the NYC meatpacking district is imminent
Are you in Paris, not quite -- Are you in NY, I'm not sure
Where ever you are you are transplanted to a another time/place
The wait staff was hurried, but helpful and especially knowledgeable about the wine list
Overpriced? No way
The food was delicious and the Chopin maritins were less than most restaurants
I highly recommend during the week for groups who want to get together and share good times
Palatable food, good company, solid drinks always make me happy
I can't believe this place is so highly rated
I guess being a native new yorker I find it hard to swallow that anyone who is from NY would subject themselves to dining at this travesty of a french restaurant
There are countless other places you could spend your dollar at
Yawn is all I have to say
The food is OK, not great
It's basically a cattle call restaurant - pack 'em in, get 'em out
Plus nothing is worth having to sit next to insufferable, prentious people, pretending to have airs about them
Definitely go here if you think this is the cool place to be
LOL
Went for Sunday brunch: very crowded by the bar area but no wait for an outside table
Waitstaff was attentive, but not pushy
We went here for the burger
I've heard great reviews it was featured in a magazine for Best Burger
I opted for the french toast, which was okay-I've had better at a diner or IHOP for half the price
The hamburger arrived with a pile of grease on the top bun and the french fries were also covered in grease
The burger was just okay
As he puts it similar taste to Wendy's
I did order a side of fries on my own;they weren't as greasy as the ones with the hamburger (still not the greatest)
MY boyfriend did like his cesar salad!  Total price $60 ($50 +$10 tip) and we didn't order alcohol just 2 iced teas
Go for the scene not the food
The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere
And where does Patis go wrong; no where
You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful
If going to a place on the down slide is your thing, this is a place for you! Bitchy servers with no manners crying about their long shift as an excuse for bad service
WOW! Absentee management and incompetent support staff
Small portions and so so food
You may have to order you drinks from a bus boy, If you can find one
But at least the prices are very high for the small portions that are dropped instead of being placed after being auctioned off
In a city of thousands of dinning options, keep yours open
I have traveled the world for the past 20 years and haven't had a more pathetic dinning experience
even in Paris
Pastis is just so passe
So stay away
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night
Great vibe, lots of people
My husband and I both ordered the Steak, medium
My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry
I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much
Will give it another chance before I write it off
Went to Pastis for Brunch with some family members from out of town
Once we were seated at our table, were we greeted by a server who was not responsible for us
When our server arrived, he made complained about having to work a 12 hour shift and said that we were being overly critical
The food took forever to arrive, which was then only passable
When we asked for the manager, we were addressed with an equally unhelpful individual who took notes (!) about our complaints and didn't know how to handle the situation
Overall, a horrible experience!!
I have had brunch here perhaps 20 times with my four year old son and/or two year old daughter
It's great to go somewhere with a friendly vibe, tasty food and not feel unwelcome as a parent
Often the service has been first rate
Sometimes there have been gaps
It's never been unfriendly
The hamburgers are first rate, people watching is stellar
Reservations are essential
Great food (steak tartare), A-list celebrities, descent wines, cool restrooms, perfect location, rude waitress(but very hot!)
If you starving and it's late night there is truly no other place to go that is going to be as good and fun as Pastis
The french fries were the best I have had in my life, and the steak was delicious as well
Go for the beautiful waitstaff and stay for the food!
The bruch at Pastis was very good
The french toast and Steak Frites both were very tasty
As expected, it is not a great deal, but it was good nonetheless

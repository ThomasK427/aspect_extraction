This, itself, should explain how popular Bennie's is
What really keeps me going back is the good food, quick service, and how inexpensive it is
If you just want tasty dishes (pad thai noodles, spicey rice dishes, etc
) and inexpensive food, you're in for a treat
It's true that they rush you in and out, but that's because this place gets a lot customers! Good place to bring your friends, co-workers and family
Meals range between $7-13 usually
Lunch Specials are cheaper
Overall, I like going here
For me, it's all about the food and low prices
I would recommend at least visiting Bennie's once!
These are the things i look for during a lunch near my office:  - great food (check) - cheap (check) - fast (check)  Don't worry about service, atmosphere, that stuff
You go there for some good homestyle Thai cooking
I can't stop ordering the Pad See Eiw everytime I go there, even though I promise myself each time I'll try something new
The curry dishes are great too
It completes my lunchtime trifecta of: Burritoville, Subway, and Bennie's
The Thai Grilled Chicken is amazing, the pad thai is great, and so are most of the other dishes I have tried
It has an authentc, fresh natural taste, not the mass produced commercial quality of some other spots
It can be busy and pressured at lunch time, fortunately I live near by and get to enjoy it any time
Unlike one of reviewers, I usually dont go to a restaurant to kiss the waitresses, so I can testify to their months smell
The food though is worth trying! I have been it Thailand, as well as visited quite a few Thai restaurants in the US since the Thai food is my favorites
This is not your Rama + a few curries typical Thai place
Instead, you will find a dazzling choice of authentic Thai dishes which you wont find in other places
I visited this place a few times and everything I tried was great
The service was prompt
There are two waitresses and one of them is very polite
If you're looking for quick lunch at a Thai restaurant by the financial disrtrict/Wall st
area then Bennie's is the place
Yes, they are busy and the staff tends to be agressive
So if you plan to eat there, then be considerate and don't lounge there after your done
There are other people waiting too
The food is authentic Thai (spicy) and can be customized for Americans per request
Don't expect a WOW in the atmosphere because it's not at all romantic nor trendy
If you've been to Thailand before
you'll realize it's just like home
A good home cooked meal
The food is good but the service is one of the worst
The waitress put the check right in front of you while you're eating just to get rid of you quickly so they can have seats for waiting customers
Some waitress (not all) have foul mouths, they assume that people don't know what they're talking about in Thai
I was a regular customer for few years but now never go back again
I used to live in Thailand, and got quite addicted to the food, so I get a fix from Bennie's delivered about twice a week
Favorites are pad thai and green chicken curry
Best lunch food in the financial district!
Thank god for Borsa di Roma
The price fix, starting at 2:30pm and lasting till 9pm closing, is amazing
$20
04 for appetizer, meal, and dessert
And there is at least a dozen of each to choose from
The portions are huge too
And the food is fantastic
Enjoy! Oh, and its usually empty
Good italian food especially when there are not many places downtown
Good for a business lunch
The ambience is mediocre for the price range, and the place is crowded and noisy
But the food is consistently very good to excellent
my bf i came here on saturday night because it was the only place open late in the area
we split a roll (~$11) from their designer maki series it was avocado, shrimp, crab, vegetables in sticky black rice
it was interesting, though the black rice was not necessarily a better alternative to sushi rice
for dinner, we both had express bento boxes mine the beef negamaki (scallions rolled in beef), his the chicken yakitori
both came with salad, rice, soup, and choice of side (i chose the sashimi)
the negamaki was tender and the fish was buttery and fresh
they seemed to be in a hurry to close and they brought the check before we were done eating and without asking if they wanted anything else
bill came to about $50 it was a decent restaurant, though they could have had better service
Yoro has very good sushi for the price, and their presentation is beautiful
We've been going to Yoro for 2 years now, and unfortunately we've seen their prices go up 4 times now, but I guess that's life
Their interior is standard Japanese decor, and the sake menu is lacking variety
Sometimes service can be slow, and we've noticed that they consistantly attract rude customers who gab on their cell phones while eating
Ask to be seated in the back where it's warmer
Alcohol is priced too high
Unfortunately the only reasonably priced sushi in the neighborhood
If you like very good sushi and sashimi
If you like friendly service and kind attention
If you don'twant to see celeb's
If you don't want to spend a fortune
If you want real good value for money
If you're not looking for a fancy place to impress your date or boss
If you want to listen to some real NYC charachters - at the bar
If you like good sushi and love fresh sashimi
I know I do!
For a sushi fanatic, I found this place surprisingly fresh and good! The lunch deal is great - $8 for a spicy salmon eel/cucumber roll
both were fantastic
This neighborhood doesn't have many good sushi places, so I'm going to stick to this one!
Excellent soups and tiny (but good) sandwiches for about $7
Phenomenal soups, not too salty, which is always my pet peeve with soup
Great creativity too, like butternut squash and apple soup
Health conscious vegetarian and dairy-free options
People will probably complain that the serving sizes are too small, but I think they're just right for having a small soup and sandwich
especially since all we do is sit at desks all day, so who needs a huge lunch? Also, it's fresh and clean inside, everything made right in front of you
As of today, they also serve Ciao Bella gelato and sorbetto! Yum!
What this place lacks in atmosphere it makes up for everywhere else
The veggie burgers are the best I've had
Try the house dressing! Don't know what it is but it is tasty
They also have a great selection of other healthy items
Still not sure why they put sliced whole wheat bread in a basket but
Great service
Hamburgers are terrific and so are the daily specials
A neighborhood landmark for years
A great value!
The food here is great! There isn't a huge selection but the daily specials are good also
this place is fun and has great food
it looks like a sports bar but inside is party central

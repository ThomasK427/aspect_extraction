Bacon was also excellent
Small and cramped seating
While the place is way too small and stuffy and there is one person trying to wait on the entire place, the catfish was quite tasty
Go here if you're not in a hurry and don't mind sitting really close to other people
small and tight but even smaller kitchen
compliments to the staff! yummy gravy! love it on everything
could drink it by cupfuls! great ham hocks
don't miss breakfast!! why complain about prices? tell me where else can you get a burger fries pie and a drink for about 6 bucks!?!
(not that you go here for that) i have always had good service and great conversations with neighboring diners
oh, so i didn't like the cornbread
big deal
i will and have gone back!
Don't bother coming here
The service was lazy sloppy
The food was not tasty
And not cheap
I recommend it highly for lunch or dinner
Come hungry and ready to eat not socialize!
I went here a couple of times and every time the food has been good
The service is good most of the time but I have had to wait from time to time
Overall though the vibe is relaxed and so was the staff
The food was good and so was the check
Im not from below the mason-dixon line but if it is like this place then maybe I will move ;o)
Unbelievable how good the food is, Its a must that you check out this spot
I had high expectations, but this is such a poor excuse for Southern cooking - especially to anyone who's actually been below the Mason-Dixon
A limited menu, and what is on there has a tendency to be dry and overcooked
The only saving grace is the sweet tea - but even that isn't worth the wait
The Pink Tea Cup is absolutely wonderful
It's the best place to get fried chicken and sweet tea in the entire region
I go there to eat - - and eat
best jukebox in the city
amazing mac and cheese
great fried chicken and fritters
always a good experience
First off, I would like to say that practically EVERYONE has eaten at The Pink Tea Cup
The walls were covered with pictures of people who'd been there from Oprah to Jesse Jackson to Lionel Richie to Pattie LaBelle
The food was very good and you get alot for your money
Whatever you order comes with salad, soup and a dessert
It's tiny in there but the food's great so that's a mild compensation
I would definately go back
I can't believe some of the negative reviews the Pink Tea Cup has gotten! This place is way better than Sylvia's who is too busy with her busloads of picture snapping-tourists to satisfy a New Yorkers' tastebuds
This is good Southern food and I know it
I've spent almost a decade down South and know good food
The PTC is almost always crowded on weekend nights because the Village is ALSO crowded -- so be prepared or go for breakfast
You get so much food for your money and you will most certainly get your belly full! I've been there twice
once on a date and once with friends
Yes, it's small but that's what NYC is all about
finding that great, small place to talk, laugh, hear the jukebox and eat good food while rubbing elbows (literally) with your fellow New Yorkers
What more could you want?
This is a great little coffeeshop/cafe that I came across while exploring the neighborhood one day
I often stop in and read over a delicious hazlenut latte
While the tables are a bit unsteady, the people are nice and friendly, and they are LGBT friendly
Service is good, though the prices are a bit on the high side
They have great desserts too!
In Short The long, rectangular dining room, with ultrasuede banquettes, dim lighting and a small swank lounge, exudes simplicity and warmth
As is Indian custom, the menu features no beef, but there are plenty of options for vegetarians
Two of the best are the simple vegetable birianyi (basmati rice perfumed with sweet spices and served with raita) and urulakilangu katrika koze (potatoes and eggplant cooked with mild spices and served with griddle-fried bread)
Outside lies an unexpected, plant-filled garden
Last Friday I stopped by Surya because I had a craving for Ginger Chicken and Garlic Naan
The Ginger Chicken at Surya is so good, so well seasoned and so tender
And the Mango Marsala Martini has to be the best Mango Martini in NYC! Service is excellent! I am going back on Friday with my boyfriend
Oh did I mention they outdoor space too
I have been here twice
once for dinner and most recently for brunch too
The dinner is a bit on the spendy side but brunch is a great deal
My boyfriend and I enjoyed the selections they had for the buffet brunch and at $10
95 it's a great deal!
some food was cold
some just wasnt as good
the service was slow took ten mins to get me a glass of water
i heard it was awsome but came home dissapointed
I bring everyone here--friends, work colleagues, family
I'm always greeted warmly and seated immediately
The service is impeccable
The whole menu is excellent, but my particular favorites are the lentil salad appetizer (like nothing you've ever had) and anything from the tandoori grill
The chicken tikka is also excellent
The bartender makes a mean martini
The ambience is modern but warm, sleek--not your typical Indian restaurant
It can dress up or dress down depending on the occasion
Everything was just OK
$120 for 3 people
Not terribly expensive but you could easily find the same food / service / ambiance for 1/2 the price for indian food
In addition the menu was the basic Indian menu
Chicken Tika massala (sp?) ,vindaloo etc
I was hoping for more
My wife and I went here for our five year anniversary
It was an amazing meal in every way
The food was some of the best Indian I've ever had - the Bhagan Barta was amazing!  The service was also exemplary
A couple examples: 1) I accidentally had a drip of sauce on my shirt and the waiter proactively asked if I wanted club soda; 2) When we finished our bottle of wine, a nice Sencere from France, we only wanted a glass of wine each
I requested a Riesling and the waiter recommended staying with the Sencere which didn't come by the glass according to the menu but he provided it to us any ways
The atmosphere was nice and clean look and a good atmosphere
I highly recommend this restaurant and definitely would go back again
Having just moved to the West Village from London, I was very happy to find Surya
I loved the decor, the service and quality of food, you just need to be here once to want to go back, I have come to know the staff at Surya quite well who are all very good at what they do
I will go back and recomend this place to everyone, and oh yeah the foods the best too (try the rogan josh, the tandoori assortment, e vanilla vindaloo and the peach sorbet)
I have tried in almost all the best indian restaurants in new york and new jersey
But i think the food in surya is excellent,specially saturdays buffet kidney beans,and chicken tikka masala
Each curry has its own distinct taste and aroma
I loved the food
The service here is great

As are the daily "Westville Market" sides--beets with toasted walnuts, fresh asparagus and the like
Everything is indulgent and satisfying in a "Mom made it" way, from the BLT with thick bacon and probably too much mayo, to the blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream
certainly the smallest steak in town to the point that we had to laugh out loud when we were served a portion + food is really not bad, especially the vegetable sides
Prices appear slightly cheaper than comparable places in the area
This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in the city
Whether I'm coming in for lunch, dinner, or brunch on the weekend - I'm guarenteed to have a great meal with very prompt and friendly service
I honestly don't know how there are any negative reviews for westville
I have been here dozens of times and have never, ever been disappointed
Their market sides are always delicious and are a great value
The salmon is also great, as is the french toast
As for deserts, the brownie sundae with mint chocolate chip ice cream will not disappoint
They have a very wide range of foods that will satisfy your taste buds, and the low-key, no-frills atmosphere is very relaxing and refreshing
Westville is an excellent restaurant
I do love their Mac Cheese (with or without bacon)
Also delicious is the teriyaki salmon, and the plate of 4 sides dishes (who doesn't love geting up to four sides - it is often one of our two entrees!)
I suspect the burgers are really good (at least it looked that way) as is everything else
Be prepared to wait outside and don't forget to put your name on the board
Highly recommended
service is slow
expect it, and you won't be that disappointed
the cheese burger is delicious, all the ingredients are quality from the meat to the english muffin bun
the shoestring fries are tasty and plenty and the dill dressing is perfect on the spring greens salad
I love this place
the food is great and its oh so cute!
The service was INEXCUSABLE
We were just settling the bill, when a waiter I can only assume held a controlling interest in the restaurant (else he would've been fired long ago) came to the table and demanded to know why someone (our friend who'd briefly left to use the restroom) had left her beer half-full
The waiter returned seconds later to complain that dozens of people wanted our table then poured her beer into a paper cup-- presumably to encourage us to leave faster
Honestly, we know small restaurants depend on table turnover-- and are the last people to hog a spot when others are waiting-- but we really had JUST finished our meal
No one of our party was drunk, unruly or remotely impolite, but the ersatz maitre d was simply RUDE
He won't care, but he's lost our business forever
But if you live close by, take out is an option
Love the market sides
I read the positive reviews on Citysearch and decided to give it a try, and I've been eating Westville practically once a week every since! Every thing I've tried has always been delicious -- if you're into simple, but tasty good food, this is it! It's not fancy, it's not pretentious, and thank God for that
Otherwise they probably wouldn't deliver and I'd be in big trouble
:-)
I ate here for the first time and have to say it's the best burger and fries I've had in NYC
No frills, simple decor, and no pretension
I don't know about other reviews, but the service and food were awesome
Food is great, but the service was inexplicably slow
Extrememly loud, annoying clientele who shout at each other and on their cell phones as if drunk
But killer tuna sandwich and burger are incomparable
First off
this place is a whole in the wall
It is tiny and you will sit right on top of each other
So if its comfort your looking for this is not the place; however, if you want good food at a reasonable price, then this is the place
What impressed me the most was their burger
It KILLS Corner Bistro, The Burger Joint, McHales
etc
By far the best burger I've had in NYC
Its worth checking out!
I had great pork chops with sauteed mushrooms and my friend had a lemon pepper chicken salad sandwich
We had mac and cheese as appetizers and everything was delicious
While the entrees were pricey for homey food it's well worth it! The butterscotch pudding tasted like pure butterscotch
The service was flaky and slow
Also the whole dining area feels like a hallway in size and shape though it is open on one end
While starting off as fans of this miniature comfort food establishment, the lackadaisical service and varying food quality has soured our tastes
I was not going to bother commenting, but the masses of people now lining up to fit into this elf-size establishment for Sunday brunch remind me of the also over-hyped Magnolia Bakery just around the corner and the deluge of ignorant pedestrians armed with the latest guidebook
The kicker to publish a review was when we ordered takeout one evening and my burger looked unfit for even the rats hovering around Central Park at night
Westville has quickly become a staple in my NY must-eat restaurant list
I've gone several times and never had a bad meal, and it's WAY easier on the wallet than anywhere else of comparable quality
I live on the upper west side, so I don't just think of this as a neighborhood place! Get the butterscotch pudding, even if you don't think you like that sort of thing
The pies and cobblers are homemade and perfectly done, the mac and cheese is amazing, even the steak sandwich is perfectly cooked and tender
Run and eat there right now!
Had a horrible fish fry there -- the fish, although fried, was soggy, and the fries were not very tasty
Plus, the prices were all above $10 for entrees -- which is not a bargain in my opinion -- and apparently the cobbler the Citysearch reviewer mentioned is seasonal, because it wasn't there when I went
This is truly one of my favorite places to go in the neighborhood
They have something for everyone, and their vegetable specials are always fantastic
Its a fun place to go, very cozy, and worth the wait! try to go during off-hours, or get takeout
Without a doubt, one of the best deals in the city
I recommend it to everyone
Went for brunch last weekend, friends had yummy 'egg scrambles' and I had a very fresh and tasty turkey burger
Bit of a wait, of course, but I did love the atmosphere - kitschy, homey - kinda like a very hip Martha Stuart kitchen (but not in a bad way)
Hope it doesn't get overexposed or swamped with too many pretentous people
This place has a great menu of comfort food and new favorites from smoky mac n' cheese to homemade oreo's (a MUST!)
Probably best to go at an off time as the seating is limited- but WELL worth the wait for such a reasonably priced treat
(PS they deliver also!)
Yummy! Grab your best friend, and be prepared to be cramped, but this intimate setting is perfect for an old yogurt-stand gone home-cooking glam! Get a bottle of wine, and eat what your heart has been desiring because all the things you would love to be on one menu--are! Appetizers are fun to share-- corn-on-the-cob sprinkled with feta cheese and homemade curly mac cheese
smoked! Delicious combos on bread--- from grilled cheese to steak carmelized onion sandwiches
wonderful fresh vegi-sides and desserts that are so yummy
They have the best carrot cake--so smooth and moist with silky cream cheese frosting
MMMM, I want to go back!
happened upon westville on a stroll
15 dollars for beers and dinner
with a date
the staff is young and very friendly
great place
I went there for lunch and it was so yummy
The steak sandwich is delicious and the brunch menu looked really good
And everything is extremely well priced
The place is small so it might get crowded
Ate there last night and will probably be back for lunch today! Everything was terrific
great food, service and the best chocolate cake i've tasted in a long time! A tiny space -- one of those little finds that make this neighborhood so special
Started with smoked mac n cheese w bacon, then the lamb sausage sandwich and my friend had a GREAT burger (as opposed to a greasy buger from the over-rated corner bistro)
Ivy's chocolate cake w choc ganache frosting is too good for words
There's already a line for dinner, so I'm posting this with mixed emotions
Too good to put out there, but Westville really deserves to be discovered -- so here u go!
The Scene A snack bar by day, this establishment on the edge of Central Park's Sheep Meadow transforms into a dinner joint in the evening
On a patio of its historical building, with a pleasant view of the park, tables and chairs are set up, and a charcoal grill lit
The crowd is a mix of Upper West and East Siders, tourists and curious passers-by from all over
The Food Disposable plates notwithstanding, the simple food is prepared with care

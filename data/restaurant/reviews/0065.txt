But don't come here hungry
The tapas portions are tiny and leave much to be desired
Each person is required to order two tapas -- averaging $10 a dish
A pitcher of sangria is around $30 and with the tapas, we're talking around $75
The service was great
Glass of wine $10, one tapas with 3 shrimp and some mushrooms $9, paella $23 - getting my butt frozen by the draft - priceless
That's why i'm not going back
It was pretty pricey for what we were served
I think the place may be better for larger groups, it seems as if there weren't many seats for just 2
Plus they don't have a sign outside the place- it was tough to find
The food was good but nothing special
Walking into this place makes you almost forget you're in NYC, and think you're in Spain
The drinks are great, and service is outstanding! The staff really seemed to care about each guest
I love this place
I've never had any complaints about the service, they are very attentive
The food is good, and I love their sangria
The atmosphere is great as well
Prices can add up if you're not careful but it is easy enough to get a filling reasonably priced meal
I definitely recommend this place
This place deserves four stars
I recommend to go back every chance you get
This place has great food, atmosphere and service
Last time I went we didn't have a reservation and they sat us as soon as possible
They sent us to there sister restaurant next door for fifteen minutes to have a glass of wine and checked on us two times to see that we were ok
I love it here and as a chef that is saying alot
Go to Tapas Lounge and go here often
A friend had told me about this place and I decided to check it out exclusively for the tapas
The restaurant is small but truly fabulous and intimate for a date
The decor is eclectic and more than a bit funky, but it works
The tapas
well, I've had better
But the experience is what makes the visit worthwhile, everyone from the door to the waiters and barstaff were very friendly and accomodating
I can see how other people might see it as disorganized but we felt it was casual rather than unprofessional
I guess they manage to achieve the desired effect because when we looked around we were not the only couple confortable with getting a little romantic
Must've been the sangria!
I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a zest for something different in NYC, I am happy to have found this gem and plan to come back
Made a reservation for 6 people one recent Friday night
The host gave us such attitude when we all did not show at the same time
and the whole place was empty!! We asked to sit and wait for the others and if they would need the table (yeah right!), we would gladly give up the table if our other 2 friends had not gotten there by then
NO! We were told to wait at the bar
while, no customers came in for a half hour
Meanwhile, the bartender was busy chatting
and when she acknowledged our presence, I got a watery martini with tons of ice in it
When I asked for another, a bit drier, she looked at me like I was crazy
When I finally got my other martini, I realized that the Vodka was completely watered down
When our friends arrived, we quickly left
Waste of time
I planned my friend's 30 birthday at this poor excuse for a tapas lounge and was treated with nothing but rudeness, disrespect and was lied to about prices, the manager(piece of work himself)knew he was wrong b/c he gave us 3 free hooka pipes(not such a deal considering we paid $873 for food that was purely mediocre at best)
The place was practically empty(surprise) and yet we were repeatedly scolded for not being quick enough with our orders, not having everyone there at 7:30 on the dot
I have NEVER been treated this badly!! NEVER go to this place unless you want stress, bad food and rude
insulting, horrible service
great decor, unfortunately the worst service possible
was seated 45 min late - had reservation
utterly rude waitstaff and mgmt
used to be a fave but will never return
The entrees we ordered were fabulous - house-cured salmon, chicken
Stay away from ham
Special margarita was great
The only negative thing is the value for the price
Small portions for what is almost a full entree price anywhere else
Waitress the night we went was wonderful
They have great food and lots of fun - if you can get in
One of my Fav spots in the city
This would be the ultimate date place, great atmosphere, couches, low lighting, finger foods and sangria
But they are completely unorganized
They stay open late yet they are rude and disorganized when you ask for a seat
They would rather have you leave than let you sit on the couch for drinks even when the place is EMPTY! If you do not order a min of 2 tapas a piece you are only allowed to sit at the small bar
Get with it! You'd be ore popular if you were more accommodating!
Stay away from this place
First, the annoying hostess said she couldn't seat us (although the restaurant was virtually empty)
Eventually, however, she allowed us spots on the communal table -- as long as we met the two tapas each minimum
Second, we were confronted by an irate birthday party which informed us that we were hogging their table
One memorable quote, from the birthday boy himself: Thank you for ruining my birthday
We were never informed by management that we had to leave in order to turn over the table (remember, this was the communal table)
Instead, we had the pleasure of being insulted by a group of idiots
(They claimed they had placed a deposit on our table)
Management acted cowardly and pleaded innocent
However, I give them some credit in trying to assuage us with dessert and drinks
Still, we won't be coming back again
OK, the morning after my visit to Tapas Lounge and I'm still angry
Two of us had one glass of wine each, a pitcher of Sangria, four miniscule vegetarian tapas servings and a dessert
The bill was $130 without tip
COME ON! This is NOT Jean Georges
I gasped when I saw the check
The food was OK, but the portions were small even for tapas
The value at this restaurant is HORRIBLE
I've eaten tapas all over the city where a pitcher of Sangria is the standard $17
00 and the tapas servings are 3 times larger and cost much less
I will steer everyone to STAY AWAY from this ridiculous eatery
This is the first time in my life I considered walking out on the bill (which I did not do)
THIS PLACE IS GOOD FOR A MEETING WITH FRIENDS, DATE OR JUST TO GET SOME REALLY GOOD SANGRIA
FUNNY THING IS, EROS IS NEXT DOOR AND OWNED BY THE SAME PERSON
THESE RESTAURANTS DESERVE NOTHING BUT GOOD RATINGS, AND I HAVE BEEN TO THEM ON MANY OCCASSIONS
I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE LIVING CLOSE TO SOME GREAT PLACES: EROS, TAPAS LOUNGE, MERCHANTS AND PECATORE
P
S: THE DRINKS AT EROS ARE REALLY OVERPRICED AS ONE REVIEWER MENTIONED
The tapas are great, might even need three per person for larger parties
The comfortable couches awesome decor make up for the sometimes snooty, can't be bothered staff
Don't get suckered by their special Margherita - stick to the pitchers of Sangria and be sure to try the dessert plate
Go on a nice evening and enjoy the outdoor/indoor tables

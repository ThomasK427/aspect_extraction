but when it finally came, our steaks were cold and chewy
Yes, chewy
Then we ordered several items for dessert and they gave us vanilla ice cream when they said that they only had chocolate
Even the waiter was surprised
Do they not know what they have on the menu? And the coffee? Order it if you like lukewarm water with a dash of coffee beans
AND on top, the waiter came running outside to tell us we undertipped him
We should have took his tip by that point BUT the waiter did not know math and realized that it was correct
double the tax
All this for $60/person? This place is for clueless tourists but if you are a regular NYC diner, you should think twice about this place
This Place was Really great!! My Sis Could not stop Raving about it--So of Course I had to try it for Myself
The place not only looks great But the Food is Delicious and the prices are reasonable
It had a really good Vibe, the service was outstanding and Never did i find myself hunting the for my waiter
the people were very attentive
I am definately going back
I went to Ora with a group of friends for dinner
We had the prix fixe dinner
It was totally worth the money
The food kept on coming , coming and coming
It was great
The staff was very sweet
after dinner we went to the lounge and had Hookah
I 'll definitely come back
This place is cheesy and the food is very average
Cod fish was overdone and limp though others had the chicken risotto and enjoyed it
There is no vibe at all and the service is slow and sometimes rude
Most of the staff hardly speak English
Also the wine list is overpriced and expensive
I asked for advice on a white wine and the waiter suggested one for $45 which I ordered
It was horrible
The cheaper wine at $27 was far nicer
Very, very average place for the price
I had been looking forward to going here for quite some time and it totally lived up to my expectations
The food was really good and presented nicely
There were good choices on the menu that it was hard to decide what to choose from
The server was attentive as well and friendly
I think it is one of the best deals in NY and I would go back!
After not eating at Ora in several months, I recently went for diner with friends on a Saturday night
It was as good, if not better than I had remebered
The staff was very knowledgeable and attentive, offering suggestions only when asked
When our food arrived we were not disappointed with our selections
Simple, yet perfectly delicious! It a pleasure to eat food that is not dredged in sauces and layered with too many flavors
The desserts were equally as impressive
Be sure to save room!
I went with a goup of 8 friends all in town for a visit from all over the country - since we were a large group and tried for a reservation on short notice we got 2 tables of 4 for late in the evening
Right before we left, they called to say they were able to put all 8 of us at one table- nice
The service was impeccable and the food in my opinion was top notch
I'd like to see more than one vegetarian option, but it was delicious
A bit noisy in there, but that could also be due to the extremely loud and obnoxious table next to us
I thought everything here was perfect
we had 8:30 reservations and recieved our food by 11pm
to top it off, they ran out of chicken but failed to tell us that until the food was served and they conveniently ordered something in its place without telling us
we forgot to tell you but thought you might like the shrimp and risotto
food was not great at all although the decor was nice
The food and drinks in this place are both really good
The atmosphere is very comfortable and elegant at the same time
The food is very creative, fresh tasty
I recently had a delicious grilled scallop appetizer and a key lime martini that was really good and not too sweet
I actually find myself here about once a week, at least for a drink and some appetizers at the bar if not dinner
It's moderately busy, but not loud -- a welcome relief if you actually want to carry on a conversation
I love this place! I found out about it through a friend, and now its become one of my favorite restaurants in the city
The food is amazing! The seafood dishes are so fresh and tasty
I highly recommend Ora, you wont be disappointed
I had a birthday brunch for my best friend at Ora this past Sunday
It was 20 of us and we had a great time
The waiter even spilt up a bunch of checks for us so it wouldn't be a hassle for the group at the end when it came to paying
The omelettes, salads sandwiches were all great! We had a long table set up in the middle of the dining area and a bunch of us hung out at the bar! great space and service
the perfect spot for a big group
The downstairs lounge was very cool as well
Right from the time you step in to the time you step out -- its a great place to enjoy good food and ambiance
Sahle is a great guy and takes good care
Great music
Initially, I chose it for the warm, modern interior, as opposed to the cavern at Craft, just down the street
Visually warm interior, with gorgeous wooden, multi-vaulted ceiling, white walls, and warm colors for paintings and trim
The staff was excellent and attentive - a glance was sufficient to get service - and the food extraordinary
By the way, I used OpenTable to make reservations, so received 1000 dining points, as opposed to the standard 100 for most restaurants
if you want to experience an inforgetable night, ask for Hicham when you book the party and let him plan your party
you will be blown away by his attention to detail
Your guests will love it
The The food is delicious, and the service is even better
You got to check it out
just love it over all -- food was great, so was the service
This is a fabulous restaurant with excellent food
My friends and I had a tasting menu and all the dishes were absolutely fantastic! Definitely try the lamb and salmon
They also had a great cocktail menu
Loved the blackberry martini
The service was impeccable
After dinner we went to the downstairs lounge for cocktails
The dcor and vibe make Ora a great date spot and fun for girls' night out!
Though we were seated 30 minutes late, thanks to a couple of glasses of comped wine and the amazing food and terrific service, I had a fantastic night and cannot wait to return--a great value--the portions were qute large and luxurious!
We tried the chef's tasting menu that was perfect
Perfect blend of flavors, perfect portions, and perfect presentation
A+ for the food but the wait staffs need to educate themselves better
When we first arrived to Ora, we tried a few specialty cocktails at the bar,they were delicious
There were 10 of us at the table
We chose the prix fixe which is perfect for large groups
The chef sent all these different appetizers to the table
Then we chose our entree
the service was attentive at times but we waited a little long for our drinks
The desserts at Ora were outstanding
The wine list was very well priced and affordable

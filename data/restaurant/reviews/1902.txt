I was more adventurous with the walnut shrimp
It may not have been five star cuisine but the casual air was the right vibe for us
And what did we dish on? I can't remember but the meal was one of the decent brunches I had in the longest time
You see when guys go to brunch, we seriously eat!
My boyfriend and I live around the corner, and this is our standby for a quick, casual meal
If we lived in England this would be considered our local
Great food, too
I wonder if the menu was different for the vegetarians who posted here perviously, but I'm a veggie and have found plenty of options -- grilled portobella sandwich, pasta with goat cheese and veggies, and you can get some of the items without the added chicken or shrimp
Yum
this place is the good old stand by
they have the best burgers and salads
i'm glad this place isn't on the HOT list because it really is a great secret
every time i go in there, we always get seated promptly
a great casual restaurant with really good food
noho star has a large selection of american or chinese ciusine, as well as an extensive drink menu
this is a great place to go if you want to grab a great casual bite to eat! this rating is based on an overall casual dining experience, not recommended if you want a fancy place
Noho Star doesn't deliver much bang for your buck
The roasted garlic burger, though tasty, was vastly overpriced, as were the rest of the meals ordered by my party
The service was a bit slow, and they managed to screw up my check 3 times
This one just isn't worth the bother
Noho Star has the only hamburgers that I will eat
They are so unbelievably good that I have quit long stretches of vegetarianism on a Noho burger
If you are a vegetarian, you won't find a thing on the menu
I find them a bit pricey and during brunch it can be a nightmare
Food was good, but not great (had the crisp calamari salad), and the prices are rather high
On the other hand, the waitstaff was super-friendly
Also, the hostess comped our drinks for botching the seating so we were pretty happy that evening
Noho Star, IMHO, has the best burgers and has had the best burgers for the last 18 years or so
The Roasted Garlic Burger is my personal favorite, but there are others
Double Smoked Vermont Bacon and Aged Wisconsin Cheddar Cheese, English Stilton and Sliced Cucumbers, and a sort of kitchen sink burger with Bacon, Guacamole, Tomatoes and Cheddar
oh baby!
This place is fantastic! I've been coming to it twice weekly for over 15 years and it simply serves the most original American food in the downtown area - and the best classic Chinese food
No wonder, since their chef comes from the fabled Quilted Giraffe
Breakfast is great, lunch is great and dinner is just as great
There is a large menu, from Prime steak to burgers, with huge salads
Service varies a bit but is always friendly and pleasant
Great setting
Obviously, I'm a long time fan
In Short Located on a quiet Soho side street, Omen's brick-wrapped dining room exudes a cozy, austere feel
Though there are a handful of Japanese a la carte offerings on the menu, the prix fixe is most popular by far
Daily specials typically include the sweet eel omelet, smoked salmon, and the signature steamed kingfish with plum
Desserts range from exotic ice creams to fresh fruit
A best known and extraordinarily popular Kyoto restaurant, Omen is famous for its namesake: noodles (o-men meaning honorable noodles), but it is also known for its fresh, bold combinations of ingredients in its okazu (the getting-the-rice-down things)
The best of Omen's cuisine is not Americanized Japanese, or even as one reviewer stated, country Japanese
Rather, Kyoto's Omen serves seasonal dishes with the subtle blending of textures and tastes that mark authentic Japanese cookery using traditional ingredients
To experience the best of this restaurant, venture into the a la carte menu, open your mind and your palate, and savor each morsel, small and savory, at the tip of your hashi
New Yorkers and visitors can revel in a real culinary trip to Japan's ancient capital via Soho
The proprietors have even imported their own tofu recipe (Kyoto, being inland, is famous for tofu rather than for fish), and has shared its secret with one of NY's Chinatown tofu makers in the production of its delectible silken variety
In Japan, eating is a cerebral and sensory art which blends presentation, history, anecdotes and taste in an ultimate appreciation of the dishes presented
Have such an experience at Omen, and for that, you cannot beat the price
-- by a former American resident of Kyoto who visits Omen EVERY time I travel to NY
We were walking around SOHO and it seemed that all of the Japanese Restaurants that we knew were closed on Labor day
We found this one and thank g-d! The food was simply amazing! Everything, starting from the Miso soup to Green Tea ice-cream was great
Staff was friendly and attentive
Usually you will need a reservation but you could try walking in if there are only 2-3 of you and you will be seated
I will definitely go back
Omen does not serve your typical take-out, aluminum-and-plastic-container Japanese food
It serves Kyoto-style Japanese, which means not just incredibly fresh and generous portions of fish (their Gardens is a wonderful medley of raw salmon, yellowtail, and tuna), but also more unique and beautifully-presented items, such as a watercress-crab-scallop house salad, filet mignon, broiled fish with miso glaze, etc
The portions are small, in true Japanese form, so if you are looking for an all-you-can-eat type of establishment, this is the wrong place
Plus, Omen is fairly expensive (5-mini-course prix fixe start at around $43), but if you stick with the a la carte menu in the back, a few of the delicious appetizers (the soba appetizer is amazingly good, but simple) can be a good value
Our Ikura arrived as a pile of shredded sea-wheat some loose salmon roe eggs sprinkled over an artfully cut radish with an open quail egg on the side
There was no way to maneuver the quail egg onto the salmon row and eat it as intended
When, presented with a $400
00 bill we were told that only Amex was accepted
No one told us while making the reservation
The note on the handwritten menu in 8 point writing is hard to decipher
A sign on the front door is placed so low, it can only be seen when approaching the restaurant on all fours
There are better options in that price range
Spare yourself the trouble to run out to the ATM as recommended by the staff , it will give you a max
of $ 100

I entered and was transported to the Venice cafes I would go to for an apertif
I was sold on the $8 panini/glass of wine combo
I pick my sandwich from the list
The food arrives and I dig in, only to realize that I had chewed up a bite of a CHICKEN sandwich (I've been vegetarian for 10 years)
I call the waiter over to complain
He argues with me, realizes his mistake, then retrieves my order
At this point I am in tears and have no appetite
The waiter brings the check over, saying that he took my second glass of wine off the bill
But they charged full price for my food
The bartender comes over, and I tell her that I was led to believe the sandwich I ordered was part of the deal, she changed it
The waiter apologized again-it was his first day
Our group eats at Cafe Tina at least twice per week
The chicken parm, eggplant parm, chicken soup and anything on the menu is prepared as if your very own italian mama prepared it! Try the crepe with chocolate and fruit
It's simple but unsurpassed
Tiny place but you'd think were in a cafe in Rome
Ask for John or Joe behind the bar and make sure Genarro is cooking! Service is a little slow due to one waitress and if busy
but the place is only as big as your living room (not Mahattan sized room) so it's to be expected
Plus, this is NOT the type of place you want to eat and run
Great place to relax and you never know who'll walk in
Enjoy
We never heard of this place, but they have a gorgeous garden in the back
We went Saturday for brunch-had the best benedict and Blondie Marys (Yellow tomato juice)
Fresh herbs for cutting on tables, then it started to rain
The ladies bathroom is stocked with goodies
Nice touch!
Watermelon martinis, figs, and blue cheese
Doesn't get better than this
This little garden is an oasis
We stumbled on it when we saw the sign 'watermelon martinis'

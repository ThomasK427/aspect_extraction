Soul chicken is good for the hunger and good for soul
Red Bamboo hands down has the best consistent veggie fare
I've turned on several avowed steak and potato folks over to the place who have returned on their own with relatives and friends
The meat tastes like meat
For best results stick to the chicken and pork dishes, the creole soul or parmesan chicken and butterfly soy chops with the collard greens are some of the best veggie dishes I've had
The desserts are very good as well, the vegan short cake, raspberry or strawberry were excellent
The tofutti chocolate / chocolate chip mint ice creams were great
Avoid the boston cream cake, it's a solid brick of blandness
The service is good, courteous and prompt
Weekends, dinner reservations are recommended   The lunchtime menu is a good way to sample different dishes
The decor is modern fusion, like the cuisine
High marks for the quality consistency
Having being a vegetarian for 23 years,Red Bamboo is the best New York vegetarian restaurant I have found
Jason Wong, owner/creator of Red Bamboo's dishes, exemplifies the melding of vegetarian and nouvelle cuisine to the ultimate degree
My husband and I have travelled far to eat fine meals at Red Bamboo; I also order Red Bamboo food for my office
The Salmon Teriyaki is gorgeous, succulent, and perfectly cooked - you would swear you were eating real fish
Master Chef Wong works on his creations, using cooking utensils like an artist's paintbrush and combining color, texture, and flavor to please every palate
I am taking my whole family, including my father who normally disdains vegetarian food, to Red Bamboo for a Thanksgiving Feast - a better recommendation than that I cannot give! Try Red Bamboo at your first opportunity!
Nothing beats Red Bamboo's Cajun Fried Shrimp
It's hard to imagine something as good as their world famous Soul Chicken, but the Shrimp is off the hook
It's great as a vegeterian to go to a restaurant and be able to order everything on the menu
They do a great job of making the food accurate(shrimp looks like shrimp, chicken like chicken, etc), and the taste is fantastic! non-vegeterians wont be able to tell the difference(for the most part)
everything was delicious
Yum! This great restaurant is fairly inexpensive AND it has great food! I have loved everything I tried- pork chops (collard greens were fantastic), spiced seitan appetizer, and the creole chicken are my favorites
Even my bacon loving boyfriend likes this place! :)
Its all about the Chicken Parmesan
I have officially turned on over a dozen people to this fabulous restaurant
Creative, determined and very professional; (while being casual) the staff and owners have done a wonderful job living up to its parent company: VP2
Two thumbs Up!
I've been vegan for over 10 years have tried just about every veg place i know of
this one was THE WORST! We started with gyoza, which was doughy,watery, stale flavorless
My husband ordered buffalo wings
gooey egg-shaped 'things' with the worst flavor texture i've ever had! The mashed potatoes were COLD not freshly made
I had fish chips
decent, if greasy, fishsticks, but served on a mound of soggy fries that could feed about 5-6 people! the papaya side salad tasted only of vinegar-nasty! the menu looked great, but the food was the biggest disappointment i've had yet!
The rubbery food we were served here turned out to be a Soy type of replacement
It was of strange texture, something like rubber cement, but a little like a pencil eraser
When we asked what exactly it was, the waitress gave us a sarcastic response, and blew us off
I guess it's for snobs or something
My 3 year old nephew refers to it as Red Booger, I must agree
I can't resist the soul chicken whether I am at VP2 or Red Bamboo, but I've been a good girl and at least tried some other menu items and everything, and I mean EVERYTHING I tried has proved amazing
The service was great, and even though my waitress was having a terrible day, my service was not affected in the slightest
A wonderful place to be
After reading the reviews right here I thought, hmmm
maybe this is a vegetarian restaurant finally worth trying
Well, I'm sad to say, it was absolutely sub-standard in every way
The carrot ginger salad dressing, which previously I thought was rather hard to screw up, was waaaayyy over sweetened, as was the soy dipping sauce that came with the chewy, flavorless, mush-mounds that they tried to pass off as dumplings
The Korean style scallion pancake was a glutinous mess, and the black rice with edamame was flavorless and overcooked
A complete and utter disappointment
Now this is veggie soul! This spot motivates me to continue as a vegetarian
I know of no other place where I can get such good MEATLESS soul food from in NYC
Nothing flies, swims, or walks, yet it's finger lickin good
Peace to the chef/founder, Jason (who comes out to talk to you) and his crew
My favorite dish is the collard green rolls
My homegirls and I visit at least 4-5 times a month
We have named it our meeting spot/headquarters
The staff knows us by name when we enter
My friend even received a phone call there once
I have taken non-vegetarians there so that they could see that not all vegetarian restaurants are flavorless
The atmosphere is great! They even complied to play one of my personal CD's when I was there
I just hope they remain humble and cool and non-commercialized
It's all PEACE YA'LL!
It's a vegetarian paradise
but the way I see it, it's a great place to take a non-vegetarian to show them what AMAZING vegetarian and vegan food there is out there
I found the food to be quite interesting and delicious
I recommend the Collard Green rolls and Codfish cakes with Mango salsa but I saw many dishes pass by and they all look amazing
(You should see the Portabella!) Jason Wong, Chef Proprietor has done a magnificent job!
Definitely one of the little vegetarian finds in the village that EVERYONE needs to talk about
I have four words for you: CARRIBEAN JERK SPICED SEITAN
I think if it were possible, I could survive on that alone
(one suggestion - the place is a bit small, so if you know you have a large group, DEFINITELY make reservations!)
This is the place you want to visit when you are in a romantic relationship or with an intimate close friend
The atmosphere is so sweet and cozy
Very European
The most amazing huge windows (especially wonderful during a rain or snow storm)
The wait staff in truely nice and very helpful-they will remember you a discreet way
The expresso, caffes and of course all the food is extremely good (the owner's mother is the chef)
The round marble tables and miss and match chairs give it unique romantic character
The only down side there could be a few loud NYU students
Hopefully more quiet romantics will discover this unique Greenich Village caffe and give it the atmosphere it truely warrants
The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and served in a cozy setting
Perfectly al dente pasta, not drowned in sauce -- generous portions
We also ordered a hamburger, which was a tad daring - the rest of the menu is clearly Italian
Although not served medium (closer to well-done), it tasted fresh and as if homemade
We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and will be going back for the desserts
My family and I went to this restaurant on a whim- we weren't sure what to expect
The food ended up wonderful
The sause was delicious
I ordered chicken parm, and it has to be the most tender chicken ever! The service was nice
However, if I were to chage anything, it would be the decor
It was just a little too drab for a Caffe
This place attracts NYU students, and locals- who know that they are getting a great deal
All in all, it was a great time, good food, oh- and excellent dessert! Chocolate lovers: try the mud cake!
After reading the reviews, I thought I would give this restaurant a try, what a mistake
The other reviewers must have gone to a different restaurant or are relatives of the owner or something
The ambience was awful looked shabby and not elegant, the waitress was the worst and flat out rude
At one point when our sushi arrived and our shrimp tempura did not for half an hour later, and we inquired, she snapped saying he's making it now! There was also a lounge singer whose vocals were so loud, it was impossible to not be stressed out and hear anything
Don't go
My favorite dish is the Kinoko Tuna spagetti - buttery pasta with hearty flakes of tuna
The $25 set meal (5 course) is the best deal in town

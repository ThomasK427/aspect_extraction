I highly recommend the sushi, but stay away from the Korean BBQ
Try going on the nights when they have live jazz
I actually haven't been to the Ditmars restaurant, but the one in Astoria on 30th Ave
is fantastic
I've eaten there many times, and the sushi, sashimi, and rolls are always top notch--better than lots of fancier, more expensive places in Manhattan
They are also extremely friendly
I especially recommend the White River roll with the amazing white tuna
The Korean dishes such as Gobdol bi bim bab are also great
If you don't go out of your way to go to Gowasabi
then you will never know what you are missing!!! The live jazz is great
as is the food
Prices are ok
Service is pretty good
Atmosphere is great
The restaurant attracts a nice crowd
You can't miss this!!!
Such a refreshing change of ambiance from your typical Astoria restaurant
Food is great, as is the service
Their dancing eels rolls are out of this world!!! The mix of art work and architectural elements add for good eye candy
The parking isn't too bad in the evening, but during lunch the traffic might make you circle the block a couple of times
it's pricy for what you get
the portions are small, almost stingy for what you pay for
it's not authentic japanese food
i was disappointed
the sosphere is nice and service was good though
Excellent Japanese/Korian food with a touch of sesame flavor, which will really promote your appetite
Has nice ambiance and good music
The Scene Why not call it Dumpling Woman, in recognition of the ladies who--behind glass--tirelessly shape, fill and pinch the delicate packages of pork, chicken, vegetables and seafood? Even weeknights are busy, with a steady stream of takeout traffic and a rotation of college kids and neighborhood folks at the two skinny bars
The flanking orange countertops add color to the tiny white space
The Food From the veggie juices added to the filling (ginger and scallion in the flavorful, tender pork) to the beet-juice colored wrappers, the dumplings simply taste better for you
The thin dough, in the north Asian style, works especially well on the veggie, stuffed with an airy mix of soft and smoked tofu, wheat protein, shiitake mushroom and bok choy
Go for steamed to best enjoy the tender skins; however, it's hard to resist dipping the slightly oily seared ones into a bath of Sriracha
I love this place
Cheap, healthy, fast, great tasting, fun atmosphere
Not the best place to order delivery from, best bet is to just go there! You won't be disappointed
Unique and fun
We, too, wondered why this place isn't called Dumpling Woman, since the smiling dumpling logo looked more like a she than a he
Never mind, I'm quite happy with the dumplings
As an avid maker of dumplings myself, I appreciate the thin, soft, slippery dumpling skin and the simple and delicious stuffing choices
I would not mind more and creative stuffing choices
I didn't try the cold sides available in the refrigerator but they looked fresh
Ambience is fine if you're ok with the on-the-go, counter-eating experience
Or, on a nice day, why not order half a dozen and enjoy the steaming hot little packets in a nearby park?
If you have the hankering for a quick Asian meal and you're in the area, I would say stop by
The dumplings are by and large pretty good -- I sampled a variety of different fillings, both steamed and fried -- but some of the different dumplings have a tendency to taste really similar to each other
Reasonably priced, although I would order more than you think you might need at first glance, as each piece is pretty small
dumpling were below average and WAY overpriced
do not understand the hype or why the owner is so mad that someone is copying his logo
I won't beat around the bush
The Dumplings here are ok
It's a bit more unique than traditional dumplings because they add other ingredients like corn into it
Other than that, this place is average
Maybe worth a visit if you have a dumpling craving you need to get rid of
If so, the marco polo, red sauce, and pork dumplings are pretty tasty
I would recommend those
You can also watch the cooks make the dumplings from scratch while you're eating
I wouldn't say this place is inexpensive but if you're really hungry, you're going to need a lot of dumplings to fill you up
The price adds up quickly
While many of the negative reviews for this place were well-deserved in the beginning (I visited the place during the first week-- the dumplings were not good), this place has improved tremendously
The dumpling skin is much thinner, the stuffing is tastier (theyve added chives, corn and other interesting additions to their meat), and they now serve snow ice
PLUS, the prices are cheap
And in contrast to older reviews, they do in fact serve shrimp dumplings (although the pork and chicken are much better) and their dumplings are made fresh
I've gone at least once a week for the past few months, and I've never seen reheated dumplings
Especially if you live in the East Village, you really should try this place at least once
Coming from Asia, I would never tell a New Yorker that Pizza Hut makes the best pizza in the city
to be told by fellow reviewers that Dumpling Man made some of the best dumplings I have ever had and big bang for the buck is just insulting
Standing behind the glass divide, I saw the cook RE-HEAT pre-cooked dumplings
and the pre-cooked dumplings were made from frozen batches! The skin was thick, the sauce options horrifying
Simple dumpling stores in Chinatown serve up better dumplings (5 for a $1)
Cute mascots do not make good eats
This tiny little dumpling bar serves some fantastic food - veggie, seafood, and regular barnyard varieties of dumpling
It was hard not to order several plates more
As satisfied as we were, we didn't feel overstuffed
The only reason I went in is because of the mascot- he's a cute little smiling white dumpling
And I loved him
hahaha the dumplings were rather good for Korean mandoo and inexpensive
The quality of Dumpling Man's was actually better than some high end Korean places I've visited
I love watching the women work behind the counter- it reminds me of family won-ton parties
Its a bit crowded so have a back up plan to eat in Tompkins Sq Park
Personally I really liked the steamed veggie dumplings and the pork was pretty good too
And buy a pin
Just cuz Dumpling Man really is that cute
Loved watching the female cooks make the dumplings as you devoured their creations
Some of the best tasting dumplings I have ever had
and I have had many!!The veggie were my favorite
I'll preface this by saying that I went here when they first opened and maybe they were still working out the kinks
However I think the kinks are permanent b/c my friend had a similar experience afterwards
Fist of all, for a place that specializes in dumplings, you would think they would have a good variety, but they don't even have shrimp for crying out loud
They were low on what I ordered so I had to change the amount (I was told too bad, this isn't McDonalds) and quite frankly the dumplings weren't that good
They were way too thick and doughy and filled with a lot of corn which seems cheap and unauthentic
I would give them another chance but I have no desire
Every now and then I stumble on a place where the food you get is worth a lot more than you pay for it
In other words, big bang for your buck
Dumpling Man is a new entry on that short list
They make four kinds of dumpling (veggie, chicken, pork, veggie), and you can order them steamed or seared
That's all they do - and they do it extremely well
While you eat your hot dumplings you can also watch the women tirelessly making the dumplings from beginning to end
I haven't had the shaved ice dessert, but hear that it's excellent too
The Scene Not much remains of the divey Sweetwater Tavern except for the name, the pressed-tin walls and elaborate tile floor--remnants from the '30s, when the space was a Polish diner
The owners of Carroll Gardens' Patois and Schnack transformed the joint into a comfortable bar and restaurant with burgundy diner booths and milky sconces, offering a late-night menu to please the block's post-concert crowd

When a crowd is that loud, loud music only makes everyone talk louder
A truly undesireable effect
I went to Rocking Horse with a bunch of ladies for a night on the town
The food was really good, the margaritas were smoking! And the service was pretty good, until they asked us to leave (little frustrating, but I understand)
And the total bill was only $41/ head
Awesome! I would definitely go back!
The host was horrendous and insisted I didn't have a reservation when in fact I did, but the manager and the waitstaff were completely accomadating and professional, with a sense of humor
The food was terrific, everyone in my party enjoyed themselves and the atmosphere leaves little room for improvement
I highly recommend it
margaritas
poor, though strawberry was better than raz
cosmos- absolutely awful and green, on purpose?!! best to do a beer, as the bartenders can't mess that up! food was decent, service was not attentive
overall, not even close to impressed
try zarela's for the best mexican (and margaritas) this far north of the border!!
jan mendelson the chef really knows authentic mexican cuisine
what a beautiful place
The best Strawberry maragritas this far north of the border
The food was fresh, authentic and not too heavy
The staff was very attentive and quick
Great place for lunch
I was not thrilled with the resturant
It seemed to gourmet for Mexican and it was pricey
The combination of flavors used in their dishes was amazing - I just wish there was more there for the price
The mango sorbet is good and the avacado sorbet is great
The service was top - notch
So I would go back
good buritos and nice interesting salsa made with bean sauce? consistant service do not expect great mexican artistry
but a little inconsistent
Decent food, great neigborhood staple, but lunch there is better than dinner
Dinnertime brings you small portions for high prices, unfortunately
The food here used to be spectacular, but a year or two ago it slipped to the just pretty good spot on my food-o-meter
I wonder if it changed chefs or something, because it suddenly stopped being as consistently fabulous as it used to be
Still, a decent place to grab a bite, but not worth waiting more than 10 minutes for a table if you get there at peak time
Low key, fun atmosphere, friendly service and scrumptious Mexican-inspired food
The dishes were creative without venturing into that dreaded territory of so-precious-we-forgot-you-would-want-to-eat-it
Weekday lunch is less crowded and the staff cheerfully tolerated a 3-year-old
(He was pretty darn well-behaved
)
The staff is wonderful! They were very nice and extremely accommodating to a large group
I have never seen such great service in New York
In addition, the decor is cute and the food was good too
A group of 12 of us went and did not pay very much for a good meal and great service
The mango margs are great and the food is always tasty! Great outdoor seating and people watching too!
I went here for lunch and enjoyed their spicy salmon burger and fries, as well as a mango margarita
The atmosphere was colorful and relaxing
The prices could have been cheaper though
All in all a nice place to eat
This place has the potential to be great
The chips and salsa are different than your average chip
But they are good
And so are the margaritas
Try the Mango Margarita
Try the glazed tuna
Rocking Horse is a good restaraunt
We've been going for many years
The food is usually very good
you could never go wrong with the chicken or steak burrito
The chips and salsa
one of the best in the city! Some of the special dishes are excellent too
Rocking Horse could be an excellent restaraunt all around
However, it is a bit pricey for what it is and the staff could try to remember their clientele
Margaritas are delicious and the sidewalk cafe is great for people watching along 8th avenue
This is a great little spot for drinks, dinner and dessert
especially if you're a gay man and want to look at the cute but flamboyant waitstaff
The steak burrito is killer, the mussels appetizer is delicious and large enough for a meal
Great guac and salsa as well
The desserts were the real highlight, though
the key lime napolean is to die for
Drawback: tiny, crowded, noisy and you may have to wait
Dinner's nothing to scream about (although there are a few winners on the menu), but solid margaritas and appetizers are well-suited for a summer evening
Upon arriving to the restaurant, i had to wait for the staff to finish their conversation before i was seated
Once seated, I was not impressed with the service or the quality of the food
Although it was not that expensive, i would not recommend it to any of my friends
My husband and I love to come here every so often for the food - definitely not the service or the ambiance
Just try it and you'll see why we keep coming back! ;)
the brunch is so wonderful at this place
the waiters are friendly, and willing to assist in anyway that they can
i loved the food full of flavor! YUMMY!
On the way home from the bar/club/whatever, this is an essential stop for me
I'm not a native, so take this review with whatever grains of salt you think are necessary
I'll just tell you this: The first time I ate here, my partner and I had just finished off a night of club-hopping and were looking for a night cap at 2:00 a
m
I had a glass of wine and escargots, and the entire experience was great
The server was friendly, the escargots were delicious, and the atmosphere was just what I was looking for
Bad reviews are either caused by a) the unlucky, or b) the highly sensitive
I loved this place because of its food and ambience
I always had a wonderful evening with friends in this place
But the staff has changed since I had last been there and that made tonight a horrible night
I was not able to enjoy myself because of the horrible service
It was disgusting
I had to speak to the manager, something I never have the guts to do
If you're expecting good service along with your good food beware of this place
The food is excellent
the service can be improved a lot
The Eggs Benedict were horrifc and the service is ALWAYS bad
Otherwise the food is decent and the 24/7 is a plus
I went the last time today because I am sick of bad service - it hasn't changed in 8 years!!!
French Roast has a great atmosphere, nice decor
There isn't much space between you and the next table, but the food and service make up for that
The prices are reasonable, and the service is helpful but not exceptionally friendly

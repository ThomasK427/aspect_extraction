I will definately frequent this little spot
I ordered a cup of chowder to go after work on a Friday
I placed my order with the bartender and proceeded to wait for 15 minutes, in which time I saw a man- the only other person in the restaurant- walk in, sit at the bar and order and receive a bowl of chowder
The 4+ waitresses loitering around the place saw me standing there yet didn't bother to offer an update (ie both of our chefs hands just fell off thus he can no longer ladle soup) or an apology
I finally asked one of them if the kitchen received my order to which she rolled her eyes at me and disappeared into the kitchen for 5 more minutes, finally emerging with my $8 soup, however without oyster crackers (she told me they didn't have any)
The chowder was good (despite the dill) but hardly worth the wait
I know from oysters
How do I know? Because I am highly allergic
Did the owner/manager - whoever he was, care? No
He stood there, drunk as far as I could tell, repeating the wonders of the oysters
Great
Glad to hear it
But, still allergic
Go bother somebody else
The lobster bisque was good, but the price of adding lobster meat was astronomical
Wouldn't ever bother again
Rather go to the soup food cart on the corner
At least I can hear myself think at the food cart on the corner of 33rd and Park
How unfortunate that this hiden garden has not been discovered
The Garden Cafe at the Kitano Hotel NY at 38th and park has gone through a hugh change
The Menu has been totally redone featureing such items as Pan Seared Kangaroo Served over spring greens, papaya and Dijon mustard vinaigrette or the Seared Foie Gras on Toasted Pepper Brioche Caramelized mango, celery juice and pureed fig vinaigrette
A great meeting place for the business man on the run to grab a quick breakfast or lunch
At night the atmoshere changes turning into this hidden jewel that is waiting to be discovered
The boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposeing
not authentic sushi or the highest quality fish (yes, I think I'm qualified to state that)  good sushi rolls and appetizers  the rock shrimp avocado roll is recommended
The udon noodles are really good
Been going to Haru ever since it opened and it's still my favorite Japanese place on the UES
Crowds have calmed down a little, which is GREAT for the locals who don't want to deal with the crappy, trendy places popping up everywhere
Leave this place to those of us who want great food without getting ripped off!
The sushi is OK but not worth the wait, seating arrangements and the pace of service
There are at least 3-4 better sushi places in the neighborhood
When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside, she recommended that we go to this restaurant
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC
Boy was I wrong! The food was great and the service was even better
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing
I would definently recommend this restaurant
One of the more accessable sushi places in NY, Haru has consistently good quality sushi, great waitstaff (you never need to ask for water or for your waitress/waiter) in a fun young enviornment
The manager is very helpful and attentive and she makes sure that everything is fine with each table
Yes, the pieces are large (too large and not expertly sliced, in my opinion), but also pricey
The Prices and long waits are just not acceptible - especially when there are many better places to go
Haru was great when it first opened - but not now
My two friends and I ate at the sushi bar on Saturday night and notices that on several occasions one of the chefs would be eating with his bare hands as he worked and then touching the food to be served to customers
Overall, it made for a pretty gross dining experience
Always a wait and only so, so food and service
Fun to dine outside, but not fabulous choices for food
Received the wrong dish -- I'm a vegeatarian and my dish came with chicken
The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water
The sushi was awful! The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting
The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine
Don't be fooled by crowds of people
The service is awful
This place is not worth the prices
Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it
Great sushi experience
Nice value
Unique apppetizers
Try sushimi cucumber roll
Food was average
Pricey
Would not return
Too many good Japanese restaurants in NYC to deal with poor service
I dont know about their other locations, but the one on 3rd and 76th fails miserably in professionalism
The Scene This vintage Cuban diner, with white acrylic tables, soft Spanish music humming pleasantly in the background and regulars casually hugging the counter, serves some of the cheapest, tastiest fare in the area
Just be patient: Service can be slow
The Food These Cuban sandwiches easily rank among the best in town
They're generously stuffed with Swiss cheese, ham, roast pork and garlicky pickles (be sure to ask for extra), all grilled to crispy perfection between hot plates, panini-style
But don't stop there--the menu offers much to be desired
The roast pork with sweet plantains is a house favorite, and the hearty, bright yellow chicken soup is surprisingly flavorful
Top off your meal with some appley-tasting Materva (malt) soda or a milky cappuccino-like coffee-- the eggy, dense caramel custard
Being from the carribean myself i have to say the food here is great
I usually get the fried pork chops with white rice and black beans
This comes to about $14- BUT IT SERVES 2
I think this is a great deal for your money in a neighborhood that is way too expensive
This cuban place should not be highly rated
The service was slow as waitresses loudly chatted among themselves
The cuban sandwich was very average and deserves no special mention
The steak was good, but the tostones were not
I'm not going back to this place
Upon entering I was afraid we had made a mistake due to the decor of the establishment
however the food is amazing and I knew we were spot on
You will walk out with the fragrance of the restaurant on your clothes
a bit annoying but it's winter - maybe in the summer that's not as much of an issue
Enjoy
One entree is enough for two
Best dishes are Shrimp w/ garlic, roast pork, arroz con pollo, and roast chicken
The Cuban sandwiches are very good also, and make a great accompaniment to the chicken noodle soup
I find the mofongo and plantains too dry, but some like them
The black beans are buttery and good too
Garlic lovers will love this place! The Cuban sandwich melts in your mouth but now I go there for the salty plantains with garlic (sprinkle with olive oil) -- they're delicious with the chicken soup
Rice and beans comes with every meal entree
Fantastic Cuban sandwich, great rice and beans and plantains
You'll rarely find such good food for so little money
The Scene This exposed-brick eatery, which seats only 25, is the West Village's answer to the perfect Italian countryside pit stop
It ought to be perfect, considering its lineage: Owners are the husband-and-wife team of Jason and Jennifer Denton, who are better known for partnering with Mario Batali to open Lupa
The restaurant is open until 2am, making it a great spot for a late-night snack
The Food The menu includes lovingly made renditions of panini, bruschetta and tramezzini (cocktail-style sandwiches with fillings like tuna with black olive pesto and bresaola with arugula), along with a roster of cured meats, cheeses and olives that have been imported from Italy
The fresh crusty breads, meanwhile, come all the way from neighboring Blue Ribbon Bakery

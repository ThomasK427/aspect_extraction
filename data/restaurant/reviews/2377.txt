We had a Blast !!! I would definatelly recommend this restaurant if you want to eat fabulous food and have fun
If you: like to wait for your table for more than an hour despite your reservation (and don't mind that by the time you get finally seated they tell you that the kitchen is closed for certain items on the menu), be treated by waiters with an attitude, love to eat very mediocre food (the Chicken Satay was truly disgusting) and don't mind footing a ridiculous bill without it really being clear what the heck you have been charged for (I quote: that is how we charge at Mr
Chow
), this may be your place
This was by far the worst restaurant experience I have had in a very long time
I definitely do not recommend, despite the very friendly coatcheck lady
Maybe I have been spoiled by having a Chinese girlfriend, but I could not believe that I just spent $220 for Chinese food
Even if you we saw some stars, the bill is not worth the admission price and I have had better chinese food in Flushing and down in Chinatown
And what is with the applause for someone making Shanghi noodles? There is definitely too much hype for this place
And to top it all off, the coat check had a $5 bill on the plate
They are definitely trying to milk you for everything you have
If money is no object, then enjoy
lets just say i went to mr
chows with a couple of my girlfriends
we had heard the food was good and with all the famous people going there it must have good food right
wrong, how more wrong could one person be
you wait forever for a table
then the waiter informs you it would be best if he ordered for you to enjoy your experience better
i never thought ordering food was such task
she said she was there before and ordered thereselves and the expeierce was bad
the food is no diffrent thatn any other chinese place
if you want to see famous people i say go
if you want good food i would strongly say no
for the average person you proably couldnt afford it
lets just say for 4 people our bill came to 650
00
I've been to Mr
Chow on few occasions, and i had the best time ever
The stuff is very friendly and helpful, the food is amazing ('till this day I never ate better food )
The crowd is one of a kind
Lot's of famous people, you name it, they all go there !!! It's a bit expensive, but well worth it
You won't find better food and service for the price you pay at MR
CHOW
I highly recommend this restaurant !!!
if your looking to be treated like royalty this isnt the place for you
ive eaten here probably 50 times and now the guys know me and cater to me well but they didnt at first
i was at the bar waiting and saw paris hiltons parents waiting right next to me
they waited as long as i did
anyway the food is unreal you just have to knwo what to get
having tried everything on the menu you should get the following: chicken satay apps, shrimp toast (make sure to use the sweet brown sauce), and chicken and walnuts for dinner
you cant go wrong w these items
expect to wait, expect to be treated like human waste, expect to take out a second mortgage to pay the bill and expect to have the best chinese food ever and youll have a great experience
An amazing restaurant, great food + service, very classy atmosphere but very very expensive
OK
First let me tell you if you dont want to spend a lot of money then DONT go here and complain about it tomorrow
If money is not a worry
or you have a nice expensive accout the DO IT
The food is expensive and amazing
The Chicken Satay is to die for
Order the Squab, Bejing Chicken and Crispy Beef
The green shrip and Gamblers duck are also the best
So dont let the waiter order for you
take my food reccomendations and get ready to be amazed
Just dont complain when you have a huge bill
I have been going to Mr
Chow's for years, and having the waiters order for you is the point! And yes, it is expensive, deal with it, or go to Taco Bell
The Squab lettuce wraps are out of this world, as is the spicy Green Shrimp, Crunchy Orange Beef, Crunchy Seaweed and Chicken Skewers
I take clients there all the time, and they all love it
When my family comes to visit me in the City, we always end up at Mr
Chow for dinner at least once during their visit
THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
Even with our reservation, they had us waiting at the bar for over an hour
When they did seat us, we all got comfortable at the table, only to be removed from the table by the host due to a misunderstanding with another party
Mr
Chow lost our business for this treatment
The food is average and the service is insulting
The waiter will tell you some cockamamee story about how he should order for you and when the bill comes, they charge you an outrageous amount and don't itemize it out for you
Considering how much they try to charge you, the servers are rude and lack common courtesy
On the east side, you're much better off going to CHIN CHIN
MR
K'S, or even Our Place Shanghai
I'll never go back and will certainly tell friends to avoid it
Even the atmosphere is harsh fupon entering
DO NOT GIVE THIS PLACE A CHANCE because they act like they don't want you as a customer anyway
Asking for the menu is out of line and unusual where the staff is actually insulted if you choose not to rely on their expertise on average Chinese food selections
Don't be fooled - the reason they want to bring you their selections is so they can surprise you at the end with a tab of well over a hundred dollars per person
While ordering, we were rudely reminded that there is a minimum charge per person - although what we ordered well surpassed the minimum
Bizarre experience is an understatement
Awful, pretentious and unwelcoming ambience is what awaits this absolute rip off
Not a classy place for classy customers
Spend your money where they deserve and appreciate it - not here
Mr Chows is one of my FAVORITE restaurants in New York
The staff is always friendly
They also pick the best dishes
We just sit back, relax and enjoy the food
I would strongly recommend the chicken with the lettuce wrap and the peanut chicken
Good people watching too
I sat a few tables over from Matt Lauer the last time I was there
I have been using Citysearch for at least a year and I have not commented on any other restrs
but I would like people to know that Mr
Chow's is the most over-hyped place in the city
Mediocore food, combined with horrible service and lots of 'tude makes for a waste of time and money
I have heard stories about places being stuffy, pretentious, rude and all together arrogant, but after 3+ years in NYC, I had never experienced this
until I went to Mr
Chow
Walked in strictly for drinks on a Sat
night around 12:30am and were warmly greeted - until we told the host hostess that we were only there for drinks
They literally walked away from us and wouldn't answer our question as to where the bar was! In the bar area there were 2 highly inebriated bleach blondes in chinchilla fur coats literally wrestling on the floor
We had 2 martinis and got the hell out of dodge
Never had a worse experience anywhere and will definitely not be back

Cockles tasted like they'd been boiled in white wine
Our waiter removed the full, uneaten dish without a word
Truffled egg toast w/ bottarga has about 1/8 teaspoon of bottarga shaved on it
Why bother? The fritta mista was actually very good
Our table was never able to stop getting bumped no matter how many times we moved it
I actually felt embarrassed eating there after awhile
Wine list is long and representative of many regions
'Ino is so far superior and it isn't like 'ino is amazing or anything
'inoteca should just serve their food at a cafeteria counter and serve great wine by the glass
As cheap as their prices are, they aren't cheap enough
Casual joint with a good selection of wines
The food was great, small but very tasty
Bacon wrapped prawns, cod fish, panini's were all very good dishes to remember
A small selection of cheeses and bread to go with your wine even
Haven't had a bad dish yet
The only bad thing about this place is their menu is in italian and although the waiter tried to help me with the what to order he wasn't very too helpful
Saturday night - 17 people squeezed into a big table and a fantastic prix fixe menu
We got to try the wines before buying them, the service was fantastic and the food was delicious
They were so accomodating, I can't think of any negatives
this place is rapdidly becoming one of my favorite places in the city
my friend j and i are always greeted with genuine smiles
the staff and owners are very helpful in suggesting wines based on price and taste, without any of the usual elitism that can accompany this type of place
the tapas and paninis are delicious, the music good, and the spirits high
even the busboy seemed to enjoy our singing along with outkast at the table! a sheer delight
The food was wonderful, our waitress was both knowledgeable and friendly - she took the time to describe each of the items on the menu and it made me want to try all of them
The panini sandwiches were excellent
Ok, I'm in the service industry 7yrs, E
Vill resident
Never in my life have I witnessed, regardless of time of night such ridiculous, cartoonishly poor service amidst insipid and retarded knowledge of any thing epicurious
Our waitress, in an EMPTY restuarant was unable to do ANYTHING unoffensive
I only came by to say 'hi', I have to go
Then sits down to BS with a table of B-boys who spend nothing
She is so inadequate that I for the first time in MY LIFE leave 10%
Offended we were, from the industry
Please, for the love of god, get a MANAGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
'inoteca was impressive
The wine list was SO big but there was no way to know what you were getting
THey should have descriptions of some wines or fewer wines or something
The food was phenomenal
There was some sandwich with tapenade and cheese and salami and the antipasta plate was really good
But maybe it's cause I live in the West Village, I just like Ino better
I don't know
Maybe I fear change
Aside from its size, 'ino is far better than 'inoteca
I went there expecting 'ino but with more room, but I was wrong
The food just isn't as good and the menu is nearly impossible to read
(unless you speak italian) Where did all the delicious panini from 'ino go?!? Even the olive bowl is better at 'ino
Oh and if you have a group of 6 or more you are expected to have a prix fixe menu
That is just annoying
Lose some friends and just go to 'ino!
i went there on thurs night with my girl friend
great foods, great wine, reasonable price! atmosphere is casual and relaxed, but since the place is so tiny, you feel a bit cramped
our waitress was friendly and attentive
we had antipasti plate ($10), meatballs ($8) and panini ($8)
these were enough for 2 girls to share
we needed to wait a bit while
we wish we could have made a reservation to avoid that, but you need to have minimum 6 ppl to do so
Finally tried this place the other day and was a bit disappointed
The antipasto platter was good but the cheese platter (we ordered all of them) was ridiculously small
The calamari salad was way too spicy, it seems that someone went overboard on the chili flakes
The paninni's were in interesting and very flavorful
The wine list was extensive but the desert choices were not rustic necessarily just uninspiring
Go for the wine, go for the food, go for the prices, go for the service
Excellent- could not ask for more
The service was excellent- the owners were so attentive, and the wine list was fabulous
Tried a Legrein and loved it almost as much as the delicious panini- try the pork one with walnut (noci) pesto and mozzerella
Can't wait to come back! It doesn't get better than simple Italian food, professional yet personable service, and excellent wine
All places should aspire to such an equation of excellence
GO, you will be pleased
Went here on Saturday night w/family
They only take reservations for 6 or more
GO EARLY! The waitress was absolutely wonderful and tried so hard to accomodate my 17 year old picky nephew to find him something to eat
She was also terrific in explaining the menu to us
Wine list is great
Be sure to have any of the Panini's and try the polenta w/corn and eggplant lasagna
On the downside, it was extremely noisy and the lighting makes it difficult to read the menu
But
the food is fab!
I went there recently and the food , service, ambience was amazing , the wine list goes on forever
I can't wait to go back there
You can't book a table but it is worth the wait
What a meal!! We started at the bar with a nice bottle of wine, which was priced fairly and sampled several different cheeses
All delicious but especially the triple creme coach goat cheese
For entree selections we had the chicken cacciatore, head on shrimp (in a honey glaze) spectacular, mozzarella en carozza (a little bit on the fishy side due to the anchovies) and the sliced italian meats, sapprosota to die for
Dessert was a simple scoop of vanilla ice cream with a hot shot of espresso
Straight forward, rustic italian
Joe who assisted with the wine had a wealth of knowledge and made a great recommendation for our second bottle of wine
Overall great meal, great value
We started with a good-dry-subtle Barbera D'Alba for just $29
Waitress tried but wasn't especially helpful navigating the 200-bottle wine-list
I don't really see the reason for such a list if the staff is clueless about it
We split an antipasto-platter which was meager at best
Included small piles of various items, including a delicious eggplant-caponata, pickled onions, and a slice of a VERY dry fritatta
It tasted like it had been made the day before
A panino with Sopressata-GoatCheese-OliveTapenade was crispy yet moist on the inside
Delicious
The lighting is awful
Easy to see what effect the designers were going for- but it doesn't work
I felt as if I was in my grandmother's dining room
Overall, one gets the vibe that theyre charging you WAY too much for NOT that much food

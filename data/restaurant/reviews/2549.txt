i recommend the captain jack burger, delicious
another must try, if you make it to dessert, is the brownie supreme
there are also monthly specials that add variation to us regulars
every now and then they offer chicken penne in vodka sauce with mushrooms (not sure of exact name) and this too is very good
afterwork many cpmc employees come here to relax and have a drink
i like my jd and coke, which the bartenders skimp the jd sometimes, unless they know me
buybacks aren't as frequent as most other bars, unless you become well acquainted with the bartenders and you might get lucky
i don't go to coogans as frequently, but overall i would recommend this place if you're in the area

I think Coogan's is a great place
the people are friendly and the food is good
Try the RIBS
I love going Karaoke night
The DJ plays great music, the equipment is top notch and the Hostess is supportive, witty, down to earth and lots of fun
They run a class act
The singers are awesome too
Go check it out
It does get crowded so go early if you want to sing
The guys are cute
Lot's of Cops

Great place to bring friends for a night of great food and ambience! I was taken aback at how quick and flexible the service staff was
Although the food obviously isn't chinatown fare, the interpretation is done very well and is very original
The food is decent and the service is extremely FAST! Try the shrimp lo mein, it's pretty good
I Love this restaurant
I'ts a nice neighborhood place where you can go and get good food at good prices
I order delivery all the time and they're great
Good music and good drinks
I take my friends there all the time because its always consistant and I don't have to worry about anyone not finding something they can all enjoy
This is an establishment that HATES children
If you have children, no matter how well-behaved they are, this is not the place to take them
The staff constantly yells at children and gives them dirty looks
We had dinner there the other night at 5:45PM - clearly it is NOT prime time for the restaurant
The snooty manager asked us to leave and gave us our check in the middle of our meal
That was just rude! I'm not sure what level of training the staff was given, but it wasn't adequate
And I am not just talking about this one incident
We've eaten there a few times, and we always got a cold reception
I'm not sure that kind of attitude flies in this Washington Heights neighborhood, where there are tons of children
We've dined here a few times in the last few months
Everything has been delicious! The brunch is awesome and so are all the regular items on the menu - salads, tortillas, burritos - at this establishment with southwestern cuisine leanings
Excellent service to be had whether you are eating in or having it delivered
Ambience is nice enough to take your visiting friends/family members
Not cheap, more midpriced and reasonably so
Definitely a dining asset for Washington Heights residents and visitors
Can't say enough good things about it!
I eat out or order in every night
There aren't many options in the neighborhood- the staff at 107 West are ALWAYS pleasant and accomodating
Even the delivery guys are super friendly
In comparison to some of the other neighborhood spots- 107 has the best service, hands down
Their Dominican style roast chicken is excellent and it's open 24/7
I recommend having it with a side of maduros (sweet plantains) and extra salsa
If you do order your chicken with maduros be prepared to add an extra 10 minutes to your wait
The service is not nearly as good as the food, particularly if you do not speak enough Spanish to order in the language and get the attention of the staff
For this reason I only order take out here
I've noticed that men are attended to first and will often break in front of women in line
Women and people who cannot hold their own in Spanish are often dismissed until everyone else present is attended to
With that said I still visit in spite of the service because the food is so good
My boyfriend and I are regulars here
When I'm in Washington Heights and I'm hungry El Malecon is definitely an option that comes to mind
The food is great and the prices are just right
The portions of food are ginormous
We go there so often that we request for our regular waitress
She is great, provides us with anything we need, and most importantly already knows what we are going to order
Even though the management is a little agressive at times, they still do a good job keeping the place running
They are clean and very attentive to the guests need
I have lived in Harlem/Washington Heights for 20 years and frequented Malecon before it became one of the in places
The food has always been a real bargain, however the service, especially the day staff is beyond rude and infuriating
Unfortunately
the staff is very friendly to males first and then to people they personally know
Last on the list is a single female
This is not a one time experience but happens consistently
If you are a female and want to have a pleasant experience, do not visit the restaurant alone
If you are a male, you are bound to have a good time
I have been going to malecon for almost a year now
The food is excellent, prices are cheap
What more can u ask for
The service right
Well that could use a little work, however, you may actually feel like your in the dominican because it can be tough to communicate
Try the rotisserie chcken, Chorriso, shrimp in vinagrette sauce
You can order for 30 people here and only pay $50
This chain of restaurants is a classic already among the people of the Washington Heights area
Each dish, with its simplicity and tasty nature portrays Dominican-ness at the very best
For beginners, try their Pollo-a-la-brasa with some Tostones (fried green plantains) or white rice accopanied with either red or black beans
You will not be disappointed! For dessert, feel confident the Tres Leches will take your breath away, specially if you have it with their excellent Cafe-con-Leche
Best of all: their prices will not leave your wallet empty
Prices are moderate, or sometimes below what just about any other place would charge for the same food
I particularly like their new location in the Bronx, at 231st and Broadway
You must go to this place
I don't know where the previous reviewer comes from
I am a recent inhabitant of the Washington Heights area, and was thrilled to have found this restaurant
There are large windows to see whats going on outside
The rotisserie chicken is some of the best I have had
There is a comfortable aptmosphere to the place
The menu is varied but I think it is the chicken which they do best as
If you just want to drink water
They will bring you a plate of sliced limes to add a little zest

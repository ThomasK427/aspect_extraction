Nice local atmosphere no tourists
Pleasant staff
Low lights, funky non intrusive music
This works
Hidden in plain sight on 9th Ave between 50th and 51st Streets
Yes it's small -- you should probably get that from the name -- but it's definitely worth the wait should you have one
The food is fantastic and very reasonable
You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the specials are always great, especially the desserts
Konrad's a great host and will make you feel at home
Nook is a great neighborhood gem and always makes for a terrific meal
Anyone who happens by this delightful little restaurant in Hells Kitchen is sure to become a regular
The Nook offers some of the most delicious food in NY, and for the right price
Their BYOB policy is also pretty handy, and the quaint, unpretentious atmosphere makes it one of the most intimate and relaxing spots I've been to in years
And if you're lucky, you'll run into the owner - Krazy Konrad - who if invited will sit down, have a drink, and regale you with stories of his native Poland
Because of the restaurant's size there is often a wait, but they do take reservations
Terrific small cafe feel
Tables are packed together in a small but character-filled room -- and it works
Atmosphere is very personable and welcome
The food and value are outstanding
The menu is appropriately small, and I've found the food delicious and hearty
We've had the two steaks, burger, tuna, goulash -- and have really liked everything
Must try a side dish of red cabbage - it's the best I've ever tasted
What a find
There's only a handful of tables and I don't think they take reservations, so be prepared to wait!
In Short Big windows and a columnar brick oven give this corner restaurant an inviting air
The oven produces an impressive variety of pizzas, including classics like margherita and five-cheese as well as inventions like potato-walnut pizza and one with asparagus, apple, mozzarella and gorgonzola
Besides the pizzas, the menu offers a full complement of pastas, such as spaghetti with fava beans and penne with tuna; and also fritto misto, stuffed calamari, and panini
I can't say enough good about L'Asso
I looked for months for a reasonably priced place that could accommodate about 40 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner on a Friday night
L'Asso did a fantastic job
We got three courses -- fancy salads, fancy pizzas, dessert pizza with Nutella, yum! -- for about $14 per person
The staff was amazing, so nice and so helpful
And the food was fantastic
Thank you L'Asso!
L'asso is hip, typically that doesn't go hand-in-hand with authentic fare
Except here
My no-gluten-for-me friend couldn't help herself, even she had to try my slice, buffalo mozzarella melting in our mouths
And no, that's not the wine talking
Pizza out of a wood-burning oven sitting behind a marble, curved bar creating this open feeling to the whole place! It's so unpretentious I almost asked one of the cute waitresses to join us
Very laid-back vibe and the music made you perk up your ears because it's eclectic, makes you sway and I want to say, cool
Also, I've never tasted a better salad at a place that does $2 PBR's and slices every Friday, try the one with grilled shrimp if you like your seafood fresh
Surprisingly, I still had room for dessert because their pastry chef makes tiramisu from scratch, can you blame me? Stay cool L'asso
the pizza blowed my mind
i have no words
i still can taste it
the quality of the toppings is extremly high
the thin crost is something i experience only in rome
its the most authentic pizza i ever had in new york
The place has a great feel to it, intimate and cozy
But the positives end there
45 minutes after we ordered, we were told that the 2 salads we've ordered are no longer available--but it wasn't even 9pm
How can they run out so early AND not realize it for 45 minutes??? Then the entrees took 1 hour and 20 minutes and we ordered salads and pastas! After all that waiting, the pastas were a bit too salty and the chicken in the salads were dry
Spend your money elsewhere
I had one slice of the mozzerella basil and cherry tomato pizza and quickly stuffed the rest into my mouth as fast as possible before any of my friends could ask for a taste
also saw a live show in the basement late night that rocked! greatfood, great time, great people
I TRIED 3 DIFFERENT PIZZA'S ALL VERY GOOD AND THE SEAFOOD APPETIZER WAS ALSO VERY GOOD
This is great food at a reasonable price
It's a great cheap date place
The service could be better
one waiter couldn't remember what we had to drink and we were the only people in the place
It's worth the trip
Great new place in NoLita with delicious pizza from the wood oven
Great entrees too- best Vegetarian lasagana I've ever had
Warm and cozy dining room, inexpensive, welcoming staff
Casual and fun- open all day too
In Short Mid-century modern decor sets the stage for an ambitious approach to burgers; high-grade ingredients, like Coleman natural beef, homemade sauces and brioche-style buns, complete the picture
The six-ounce patties arrive plain or with toppings like mango salsa and cucumber-mint-yogurt sauce, or in an assortment of specialty styles, like Chicago (bacon, cheddar, Thousand Island dressing) and Dallas (onions and barbecue sauce)
Fries, smoothies and salads round out the meal
Juicy burgers
good fries
honest teas
the BEST BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN SALAD ever! Take a greasy burger joint and bump it up the scale a bit and voila
New York Burger Co, somehow, a trendy, upscale take on old, American fast food
I'm working in Chelsea this week and I just paid $7
00 for what? This burger was overpriced, but I'd heard good things about this place
NOT WORTH IT
My burger was lukewarm, and if you can believe it
overcooked
meaning: it sat urder some sort of heat lamp for probably 15-20 minutes b4 I even ordered it
So for a $7 dollar burger your taking on the run, you'd expect catsup in the bag right? don't bet on it
I was so annoyed w/ this place that I just registered w/ citysearch so I could enter this review if that tells you anything
So, I've finished my burger, I'm still hungry and I'm out $7
Go figure
For your average burger eater, NY Burger Co
may be a bit much but for those burger lovers out there, this is the ultimate
For roughly $10-12 one can get themselves a healthy burger decked with toppings, fries, and a drink, a meal that makes the neighboring fast food places look inferior
The burgers themselves are thick, juicy, colorful, and have the freshest odor that makes the hungriest even hungrier
With the many choices of burgers they have, comes their fantastic fries that are crispy, brown, and rather unique to your typical golden yellow ones
The service decent, the cooks know what they're doing and one can customize their burger however they'd like
The restaurant itself has a colorful retro feel that is reminiscent of the 50s burger joints
In essence, it is simply one of the best burger spots in Manhattan
And whats more, they deliver
I have been to two locations, a total of three times
Two of the three times, I have declared my burgers as the best I have ever had
No lie
I order my burgers medium rare, and two of the three were perfect
The french fries are also perfect: fresh, crispy, and nicely browned
Wow, this place is great
I particularly liked the self-service condiment and sauce bar; lots of sauce selections and burger fixings
My dining partner ordered the turkey burger and declared this also to be the best one ever

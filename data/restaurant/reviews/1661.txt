despite the fact that this highly unpretentious, affordable spot gets packed so quickly due to its size, i can ALWAYS count on having a good time here
the music is great, there's a good-sized dance floor and ample seating
bar tenders are pretty pleasant, and i never get that holier-than-thou attitude from any of the customers that frequent the place
Where else do you go where you're served bruscetta BEFORE you order? Eat and converse while you're subtle backround music is singer standards like Sinatra and his contemporaries
The service is pleasant, too
this place is around the corner from us and we tried it on a saturday night
like the other reviewers we were also amazed that it wasn't packed
food/wine was very good, service was friendly and not rushed, and a great value
we've also taken out - same experience with food -always consistently good
romantic, cozy atmosphere and nice outdoor dining area
highly recommend
At 9 pm on a Friday night, I couldn't fathom why this place was not full
But a slow dining room allowed us to take our time without a lot of noise, and we were rewarded with remarkably good food at a very reasonable price
We started out with the antipasto for two--the sausage and prosciutto were nothing to write home about but the mozzarella with fresh tomato slices was delicious--smooth and milky-tasting
I had the smoked mozzarella and asparagus ravioli in pink sauce, which was absolutely delicious and a real bargain at $11 or so, and my husband was very impressed with his Mediterranean sea bass
The waiter brought two excellent pieces of bruschetta along with our bread basket, leaving us wishing that we had shared the bruschetta appetizer instead of the antipasto
We sat inside, but we also checked out the back garden, which was lovely
The restaurant gives you a homy Italian feeling
The food is excellent and reasonably priced
Europan dining in the East Village! No hurries, just enjoy
If you want something special, ask for it and likely you wil get it
The party room/lounge (Bacchus Room) with bar is a great extra future
I will return and return and return
During my stay in New York I visit Bona Fides
It was a pleasure the be there
I'm looking forward to eat there again when I visit New York
Please stay as you are!!!
Great Food, Great Wine, Great People
The Atmosphere is absolutely fabulous
Great Appetizer and Main Course
Bona Fides is a romantic restaurant with excellent food and service
The wall paintings are magnificient
I don't understand that the so called famous food critics have not yet found this place

At Bona Fides you will enjoy your excellent dinner without any interruption

Many restaurants may us Bona Fides as an example how to treat their customers
During the weekend visit the next door Bachus Room
Food is ALWAYS wonderful
And if u have a recomendation to the menu-make it
Yes, this place gets crowded on Saturdays, but the rest of the week is fun and relaxed
Nice place to take a client when they're looking for the real East Village, but not reaaaalllly ready for it
Staff makes you feel welcome and the art work is always a great way to introduce yourself to the hotties that hang here
Good enough and varied enough that you can dine here more than once a week
Great place to go, on a romantic dinner with that special someone
Good food, great ambiance, and a good deal for a buck
Will be back for sure
I've been here a few times
I've recommended this place to all my friends they have never failed to impress them
The price is right, the food is good the ambience is a great setting for a bday dinner w/ a group of friends
I'm actually going back tonight! The dishes are very filling more than expected
Great deal!
my in-laws and my parents were meeting for the first time and i decided to take them to bona fides
it was perfect, it was a sunday, so there weren't too many people and the atmosphere was very cozy
everyone enjoyed their food and everyone was happy with the meal
This restaurant is simply wonderful
You can be sure that you will have an enjoyable experience
The ambience is cozy and warm
The food is tasty yet not overbearing
The service is polite and patient
The price is just right
I will go back many times
try the fettucine alfredo with grilled chicken
Gosh, i went to heaven
good service, great ambience, even better prices
good east village location!
I can only imagine this is how Little Italy restaurants may have been before those maitre'd started trying to usher you into their respective establishments
Totally relaxing ambiance, great food
and w/a respectfully impressive yet inexpensive wine list
My idea of a good out-of-the-way date place
Service can be slow but accomodating
Italian fare done without fanfare
a neighborhood oasis
A great atmosphere, excellent food and wonderful prices! What's better than that? Went there for New Years Eve, without a reservation and got seated and was not rushed out
The service and food are both impeccable!
Great food
Great prices
Never had a problem getting a table
Highly recommended
I've been this neighborhood a lot, going to various Japanese bars and restaurants, but never aware that there is this fantastic Italian place hidden in-between them
There were 6 of us, I ordered grilled brook trout, and my friends had pizza, pasta and grilled baby chicken
Everything was fresh, light, but amazingly tasty
Great ambience, very friendly service, and inexpensively priced
My grilled trout was the best trout I've ever had and it cost only $14
95! If you care about quality ingredients and fine cooking, you'll truly appreciate this place!
Col Legno is a great place to go and has always served top notch quality food
The pizza's are great, the artichoke appetizer is delicious, and the entrees and pastas are always fresh
The gelato and sorbets are even great
The owner seems to always be there and he's a big help
The wine is well priced as well
I first went to Col Legno when it opened and loved it then and still do
It is a great neighborhood Italian restaurant and the food is quite good
Service can be frenetic and harried but I would still go and enjoy the food, the prices and reasonable wine list
One of my favorite restaurants in New York

Nothing to excite you, but that's a good thing sometimes! The food is a good range of salads, sandwiches and entrees - anyone can find something they would like
It's all prepared well and served without attitude
It's nice for a quick after-work meal at the bar or out front
The back and lower level lounge seem a little dark and cramped, however
Altogether, it's a solid place with good food and drinks
I have not been to Merchant's in a t least 6 months
it looks great!!! Many new things have happened, a new downstairs lounge
that is great for parties, a new menu with many new options
Great ambience for get togethers with friends or just to chill in the lounge with great music!!!
We couldn't even get beyond the manager and host
The manager (obviously an ex-hockey player) was too busy changing the lighting to notice that customers were waiting - until two young attractive women came in - then he only sat them (before three other waiting couples), then back to his lighting issue
Not sure where the hostess was, waiting for fifteen minutes for anyone to notice we were there, then was told we would have to wait another thirty
I hope the two young women had a nice dinner
Been here twice in the afternoons
Both experiences were ok
The chairs by the bar are a bit worn and sad looking
The waitresses are young and not too enthusiastic
Kind of stingy with the bread basket
But if you're there, have a sour apple martini, it's delicious
9 of my friends and I went to this restaurant last friday night for a birthday dinner
The beginning of the meal wasnt bad, the hostess was very nice, we got our drinks about every 10 minutes and the appetizers we good
However, once dinner arrived, 7 of us got our entrees and the other 3 didnt come until 30 minutes after
We asked about our meal several times and I finally complained to the manager who gave us a free round and a free bottle of wine
Overall, the service isnt great, and the food is fair
They dont have grey goose either if you were wondering
Great place, specially for outside eating
Good menu and the area downstairs with the fireplace is worth a visit
The Scene Cool breezes carry the warm smell of curry, and the sound of sitars cascades from above in a space that's barely wider than an alley
The design is spare--the fewer than 30 seats are always at a premium
The service is extremely deferential--diners are greeted with a polite bow as they enter from Greenwich Avenue
The Food During lunch, each diner gets a thali (or "plate") of fiery small portions, each of which is separated into a small steel bowl
An earthy mix of tender potatoes, peas and carrots is excellent, as is a lentil soup
The mango lassi--a cooling yogurt-based drink--is not to be missed
Thali had taken a downturn awhile back but three recent trips have shown it's once again a place to enjoy quick, inexpensive food
They're not perfect and have their problems
Mostly alot of repetition(they need to change the selection more often and find something besides rice pudding for dessert) and consistancy(food is not always warm) and there will be at least one ordinary item on the thali but there always will be one or two engaging and even excellent items to compensate
They now also serve appetizers
The samosas come with sauces that are dynamite
I used to frequent this place about 2 years back and was in love with the simplicity of the food
The cook was very good and prepared hot chappati's
My recent visit was a total washout on my expectations
Firstly the cook had changed and they have started server Idli/Dosa
The Dosa was ok but the chutney was really sweet and they served Dal as sambar The thali has also changed
I could see the server opening the refrigator and serving reheated food to me
The roti's were nothing great and the food was considerably tasteless
TOTALLY AVOID THIS PLACE, hope the owner reads this and brings back the old chef
thali was the best find down-town
the concept COOL and the food supmtious
It's small and cramped, but it's down home Indian food, not like the heavy cream sauces and curries you find in most other places
This also makes it a lot healthier
While there are now a few appetizers, the traditional thali (sampling platter) is often your best bet; fixed nightly menu changes daily
Limited beverage selection, BYOB
Very friendly staff
Prices are an absolute steal for NYC -- a thali alone is $10 and filling for most people
This is a cheap as well as quality restaurant
Good healthy eating
Quaint and friendly
Decent food, great for the price
BYOB
one of my favorite indian restaurants in the city! healthy vegetarian food - not greasy like so many other indian places
Super fast service, nice size portions, cheap, great tasting, good selection
Great mexican food experience
The Scene The sexy, animated setting features a gleaming white decor
Frosted-glass panels, gold-rimmed mirrors and wood tables offset the vanilla color scheme
In warm weather, the garage-style front doors are raised, merging the dining room with the sidewalk
The Food If you don't opt for the fluffy all-day omelettes and pancakes, you can stick with a traditional lunch menu, which can include a bowl of steamed baby mussels in a garlicky tomato broth and a salad of cherry tomatoes, cucumber and red onion on toasted sourdough bread smeared with tangy goat cheese
Don't miss the macaroni and cheese, a crusty, bubbling version with just the right blend of cheddar and fontina
I love the decor here
It is best to sit outside during the summer
The watermelon Mojito is very good
I had the Crab burger with sweet potato fries I loved it
The service is just as good
I will be eating here alot more often
The ambience and modern decor makes this restaurant a very wondeful dining experience
Tried to go there last night (it was a little after 7:00 pm on July 4th)
Several tables were empty, but when we approached the snooty host (after he intially ignored us), we were told there would be a 25 minute wait
What's up with that? Will not go back
Is it only me or do you notice a trend in the recent reviews ? Even the BUSBOYS have an attitude in this place
Very good fried Calamari Mussels
The rest of the food was sloppily presented and over-sauced
The Mac Cheese was also under-seasoned
Not to mention that the busboy spilled 2 glasses of water on my back and the Manager was NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
No apology
No NOTHING !!  Restaurants can only rest on their reputations for so long
Maybe when business starts to decrease they will realize that they need REAL Management on the floor and a REAL Chef in the Kitchen
(Not to mention LESS attitude on the floor)  I avoided this place for years
You should too
I will NEVER go back
horrible service
i must repeat horrible service!!!!! i wll never go back there
i waited for 1 hour then decided to cancel my order
i took another 45 minutes so i called back the waiter and said that if the food was ready now ill just pay for it
he said
the cook didnt even make it yet! not a good place
there are many other trendy places with good looking people only they have better service!
i have never written a review before, but feel compelled to warn future cafeteria-goers
i had a horrible experience with a waiter while trying to have breakfast friday morning
he got my order wrong twice and argued that i had mislead him, which i promise was not the case
he and i argued a number of times and in the end i didn't end up eating at all
i have never been treated so rudley in a restaurant

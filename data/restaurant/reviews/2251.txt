spices that equate to the person sitting next/across from you having half a meal  otherwise, everything else was great! definitely try the red (or white) wine
I have been eating at this terrific restaurant for years and eveyone I have taken there just loves this place
Living in the East Village, I must pass by 50 other Thai restaurants in order to get to W
51st (Chanpen)
This place has the best chicken Pad Thai
I've never eaten in, but they have prompt delivery and the food is just delicious!
Best Thai in the city
I don't even like Thai all that much but my boyfriend is crazy about it
So I went after checking them out on CitySearch
Call me converted
I am a huge Thai fan now but only when it comes to Chanpen
So good that after my first time, I went back four times in the same week
I brought my work colleagues for lunch, my out-of-town friends for dinner, my boyfriend again for dinner and finally a birthday dinner with 10 friends
Amazing
Try the Chanpen Duck
It's excellent
The place is a little small, but the GREAT FOOD and exceptional service more than make up for it
It was really busy the night I went, but the waiter was very attentive and our food came out incredibly quickly
And, to top it all off, everything on the menu is reasonably priced
We had dinner for two (appetizers, entrees, and wine) for $40
If youre looking for a great Thai place-- this is it! 51st and 9th Ave
great seafood soup but too much peanuts in the dumplings
we were the only folks in the place for Saturday lunch
The Pad Se Ew is my favorite
fast service and pleasant atmosphere
not your typical Thai restaurant which makes it even more charming
The Scene A universal quest: "Where can I find a restaurant in the Theater District that serves good food, has a lively and comfortable atmosphere and is inexpensive?" For nearly three decades, La Bonne Soupe has been providing just that
The colorful main dining room has all the trappings of a real bistro--red-checkered tablecloths, neighborly banquettes, amiable French waitresses--and, indeed, the soup is good
The Food The soup-centric bistro menu offers plenty of familiar favorites
The more adventuresome might go for the excellent brandade de morue, a garlicky puree of salt cod and potatoes that you scoop up with toasted baguette; other specials to watch for are the copious bouillabaisse and an authentic Moroccan couscous
Three-course meals of salad, bread, soup, a glass of house wine and dessert start at $14
Theatergoers should keep in mind that the kitchen serves late, so it's a great place to pop in for dessert
Loved the escargot as appetizer- just the right blend of garlic and spices
The soups were excellent especially the french onion soup
We enjoyed our crepe - La Forestiere, but we found the Omelette Paysanne overcooked and a bit dry
Service was erratic and the space was a bit cramped that you are sitting almosty elbow to elbow with the people next to you
The wait can be long especially during brunch time but worth it
I got the onion soup and it was great
The problem was that we waited for a long time to get our waitress, we had to ask the bus boy for refills for drinks, and we waited for a long time to pay for our check
The food was good though
The French Onion Soup is so amazing that this has instantly become a favorite hangout
My dining experience was fantastic, marred only by substandard, over-cooked creme caramel
A friend from out of town wanted a cheap, good dinner
We were sat immediately and the atmosphere of the restaurant is indeed very French
Downstairs is quieter and dimmer, upstairs is bright, loud, and inviting
The French Onion soup was delicious and my friends raved about their crepes
My salad nicoise was yummy and we found our house wines to be satisfying
HOWEVER, our server was just terrible! He repeated our order disdainfully as if to mock our French pronunciation
I sat for 10 minutes with my salad while he claimed he was getting the salad dressing (instead he was chatting with other tables)
When a friend declined wine he rudely joked if she would prefer a Shirley Temple
Overall I would return for the food but highly hope that the French 'tude doesn't come with my order of soup!
Soup is fantastic
Highly recommanded French Onion Soup
Crepe is good too
They have a range of varity
Tuesday is Crepe day
They have special
Good deal
Price is absolutely decents
Though service is not that good, and seating is so close
Food and price are worth going
I am a frequent customers!
We got into NYC late and asked the conceirge a good place to stop in at 11 PM and she recommended this place and we were so happy! The cheese fondue was wonderful and the chocolate mousse some of the best I've ever had!
Loved the steak dishes with special sauce and fries (hamburger patty cooked to your liking without the bun additives)
Restaurant is plain inside (kindof diner style) but quaint, good for a low key meal with friends - not very romantic but the food is why you're there
Chocolate fondue is amazing, also tried the home made lemon tart - I've had better but this is good
I'd definitely go again
Reasonable prices with great tasting hearty food
This place is amazing
Went here for my 2nd anniversay with my boyfriend everything was perfect: the delicious French Food, the quaint interiour decor beautiful balcony seating, the calm/relaxing atmosphere you'd find in France and not in most hurried NYC restaurants
Tues
is Crepe night! Seating was crowded, but makes it fun
Choc
/Banana crepe was good, but choc
wasn't Nutella
oh well, can't have everything! I didn't experience slow service as some others have said
I don't speak French, but this lovely establishment has always made me feel welcome and right at home
From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, you'll find a friendly, familiar menu with great special dishes
And if you do speak French, c'est bien-you'll enjoy this place even more
I highly recommend
If you have ever been to France, you feel as if your back the minute you walk in the door
From the tiny tables to the french speaking staff and patrons
Extremely well priced with remarkably good food
An unassuming store-front leads you into a classic French bistro - one that I'd certainly visit again
Seating is undeniably close - but in a manner that adds charm to the experience
Experienced a pleasant lunch, with above-average food and service
(Would recommend the soup lunch special: salad, soup, wine and dessert for $13)
High marks for the Creme Andalouse - very tasty
Caveat: get there before the super lunch rush - no problem being seated at 12:30; line out the door at 1:15
Apologies for my bad French in the title, but this restaurant lived up to that name! I sampled the Lasagne a la Francaise and found that the French can take an Italian dish and make it better
The crepe in place of the pasta allows you to experience more of the flavor of the meat and sauce
Mousse au chocolat is a chocoholic's dream
I did not find the slow service that other reviewers have mentioned; however, this place is small and it is very easy to bump your fellow diners or knock over their silverware
(I think this is the reason they have a coat rack at the entrance
) In short - five forks! :)
After lackluster, exhorbitantly expensive meals at Daniel and Jean George, we were thrilled to find this wonderfully inexpensive restaurant--A guaranteed authentic French Bistro style gem with prix fixe menu cheaper than you could cook it for at home
This restaurant was conveniently located close to our hotel, the Warwick, we returned on FOUR different occasions during our week-long stay
We gave up our hard fought reservations to Nobu to return here and will never regret it
I once lived in France, I felt like I had returned
There were lots of french speaking diners present but don't worry, they speak English too

The food was good
but being that 4 of the 5 of us are bartenders and waitresses
we realized how bad our waiter sucked!!
I have been to Johns four times, and each time I have had a very positive experience
We recently had pizza there on our last trip to NY and it was excellent as usual, but the service was great also
Our waiter was prompt, polite, and attentive
His shift changed and the waitress that took over was also excellent
Everyone in John's was friendly to us, and we loved the thin crust pizza
It's an inexpensive meal that tastes great!
We went to John's directly after checking into our hotel on our first day in NYC
The pizzas are wonderful and the service was just as good
My wife and I debated on what size of pizza to order, and decided to just get the large
Good thing we did! The pizza was so good ( we were so hungry!) that there was only one slice left
The large was only $2 more, so go ahead and order it
The decor inside was incredible! This is one of the places we dined at that definitely warrants a return on our next trip
You will NOT be disappointed!
NO garlic powder, are you kidding?  A good friend of mine who used to live in NY came across a NY top 10 pizza joint list and I was intent to try some of the places I hadn't yet been to
This John's was ranked #7 but I seriously consider whether this place truly holds its own
They don't have garlic powder for their patrons to use, as garlic is a 'topping'
So instead you can get diced fresh garlic on your pizza, for a fee
Now I'm sure it probably tastes good, but in my opinion there are much better places serving a better 'raw' slice of pizza
Adding garlic powder has been a way to season without affecting texture, and I don't agree with this place's decision not to offer it
Tourists will find this palce good, but trust me, there are better options for you
Visited while on vacation and reading reviews
Went right at 7:45PM on a theater night and got right in
Great pizza
Noisy, but eh, it's a pizza place! Great pepperoni
We'll be back for sure
great location near Times Square and the theaters, nice interior, not too loud
Certainly a step up from most pizza joints as far as atmosphere is concerned
The food is quite good but doesn't match up to the best places in NY
Have been to John's many times (Time square Bleeker st
) it is simply the BEST pizza made anywhere in the city!
The food here is great, and the restuarant has an amazing atmosphere
There are only two downsides
1
) They close fairly early so don't make this your place to eat after seeing a Broadway show at night and 2
) The service tends to be less than perfect
If you can deal with slightly rude waiters, the food is a definite must have
I have come to New York City 5 times
I am from iowa -- yes we have indoor plumbing! anyways
It is now a tradition to come to Johns pizzaria
I always have to get my picture taken on the stairway
THe pizza at John's is awesome, i am just amazed by the way they use the brick oven
Go there its awesome!!
Steps away from the famous Sardi's but just not in the mood to dress up or the budget is slim, is a pizza with my name on it
In a quaint old church is gobs and gobs of great food, enough to share at a price (for 2) under $50, my idea of heaven
Easily my favorite pizzeria in all of Manhattan
Right across from the Majestic Theater, it doesn't stand out among all the other high-profile eatieries, but it's definitely worth checking out
The interior is interesting, especially the main dining hall
The service is always good, and the prices are reasonable for the quality of the food
The thin, crispy crust is wonderful, and the toppings are just as good
It gets busy at lunchtime, so get there early or go late
The food was great, no doubt but the waitor had issues
First of all we had a party of 6, all of my friends got there food first and mine didnt come
I asked if it was coming and the waitor saidOh that's right,sorry
My friend and i were spliting it so we told him agian that we wanted regular raviolli that we would spilt
About 10 minutes later he came back with spinach raviolii
EWW! The waitor thought that we had said Spinach not spliting
10 minutes later{20 minutes after my friends got there food} our right meal was served
Ther raviolli was one of the best iv'e ever tasted
So the food was exellente but if you are ordering make sure to speak clearly
A quick peek thru the windows confirms that despite being 'just' a pizzeria Johns is as they a classy joint
Once you step inside though you can be overwhelmed by how huge the place really is
The attentive waitresses only add to the excellent ambience
John's has a small menu of traditional Italian fare all of which is good
But you don't come to John's for the pasta, you came for the old school brick oven pizza and you won't be disappointed
Perfect crisp texture with just the right amount of sauce and cheese and add to that some tasty toppings, equals a dining experience you'll come back to again and again
This is a fun place to eat with a festive atmosphere, great decor, and oh by the way, pretty good food
The prices are also good, by NYC standards
The Chicken Parm and Baked Ziti were excellent and I wanted to swipe some pizza off the table next to me it looked so good
Get in early to beat the crowd
I went here with my family for dinner expecting the usual great pizza
Once again, I was not disappointed
However, we also ordered the CHICKEN PARMESAN
I must admit, this was probably the BEST chicken parm I've had in a LONG time! Everyone knows how good the pizza is here but please, next time you go back to John's, order the Chicken Parmesan!
I'm actually from NY but I currently live in CT
This past weekend my family (incl in-laws) came to the city for a show and dinner afterwards
I had never even heard John's until I went online to find a spot that would accom
a party of 16
It was rated well so we thought we would try it
WE LOVED IT! We had a reservation and we were seated right on time
The service was very good although we were warned that it could be slow
The pizza was delicious and the Calamari was to die for
Overall a definite 10
we plan on going there again again
good pizza nice people it is a good place to eat would go to again
We arrived at John's on a Thursday evening at 7pm
The place didn't seem all that crowded, however, when we put in our name for seating, we were told they were all out of pagers, our wait would only be 15-20 minutes but to come back for a pager in 5 minutes and that if we didn't, we'd lose our place! WHAT?!?! We wait 40 minutes to be seated, and got a pager five minutes before we got seated! Fortunately, the food was excellent and the setting was interesting (you can watch the pizzas being made and put into the brick ovens) or I might not have been so generous with the review!
We, 2 people, just happened upon this place after seeing The Producers
Walked in and got on waiting list
We were told it would be 20 minutes, but it only took 5
We ordered a small, 6 slices, Bruschetta Pizza and Spinach Ravioli
MMMM! They were both wonderful
Also, we had the Tiramisu for dessert and loved it as well
Our waiter was busy but he took care of us
We were never just sitting there wondering if he as going to return
I also had a glass of the house wine, red
It was good as well
Next time I will order a half carafe ($11)

Refreshing cocktails too and a bar scene that heats up after dinner hours
Service is friendly and helpful, more so than in most area eateries -- prices are moderate considering the quality of the food
We were delighted and plan to return whenever we are in the nabe
Bravo Breeze!
I've been to every hot sushi place in town
Koi, Nobu, Blue Ribbon Sushi, Sushi Samba, AND MORE!!!!!! This is by far the best sushi I've had
My fiance and I went last night and didn't want to leave
The service was incredible and the food was better (if possible)
I was going to go to Koi for my birthday and we're going to Butai instead
Try the chicken meatball skewer and King California roll
The spicy tuna was so fresh we ordered more when we were STUFFED
I only wish zagat would review this place so more people could enjoy
GO GO GO to Butai and you won't be disappointed
Thank u Butai xo
We live on Irving Place and finally visitied Butai 2 weekends ago
It was a long overdue trip and I am glad we made it
We had a great time there - the ambience was excellent and the food was truly exceptional
If you are looking for the usual Japanese fare, dont go there
If you want to try different little Japanse dishes, definitely check it out
I loved the homemade tofu dish and the lucky bags especially! I agree with what a previous reviewer said - i hope this place doesnt become too popular!
A friend and I took advantage of the 5-7 happy hour to order 6 charcoal skewers at $6
50 per 3
Our favs were the sausage, tripe (?) with radish, and bacon wrapped asparagus
The rest were fine too
Add a bowl of (less than perfect) rice and you've got a cheap light meal
The server got the wine wrong, the order wrong, and the whole experience was incredibly slow
It took them nearly half an hour just to bring out the wine
To top it all off, the toro sashimi was more like maguro
I went there on Monday nt and it was absolutely perfect
I was on a date and wanted a sushi place which doesn't look like a showroom at IKEA, and is not over played like Samba or Haru (which are both great places)
The service was excellent, the food was very good, and the ambiance was trendy but chill
They have a beautiful upstairs with comfortable tables
The Manager was very inviting and talkative at meals end
The menu was more than sufficient and had some great combinations and rolls
I strongly recommend dining here, bringing a date, etc; As for me, next time I am going to try the beef from the true Japanese-style charcoal grille!
I have been back this restaurant manytimes already since my first visit
The chef Seiji has never dissapointed me
His personal warm well-thought suggetion, servise as well as cooking all are extraordinally good
All my friends and clients I took for dinners became huge fan of him and his cooking
I am writing this again because I really really want to suggest you to try his place even though I personally do not want to get this place toooooo popular
I will have hard to time to get a table then
really worth trying
Just went by myself, on a Sunday night - sat at the sushi bar and had a great experience - food service-wise
The lychee martini was great, but the highlights were the various food options - from a melt-in-your-mouth marinated tongue to the surprisingly buttery grilled sushi
the eggplant with bonito flakes was delicious, too
and i agree with others postings here - the sushi chef was very amiable and helpful!
This place is a great change from the ordinary sushi bar
They do a traditional Northern Japanese cooking technique that is simply phenomenal
Go with the chef's choice
This was our first, belated visit to Butai, and it is the first Japanese restaurant we have been to that is on the way to replacing the sadly missed Waka
The food was excellent - fresh grilled meat and seafood, and a good sushi selection - but what we really liked was the personable manner of the staff, particularly the chef
We sat at the sushi bar, and he was very friendly and helpful, and made us feel most welcome
The bar has good ambience and decor, if a little empty
Honestly, the worst service review that someone submitted really surprises me! This place has some of the best service that I have experienced in ages
Maybe they read that review and 180'd completely! My only regret for the night is ordering wine by the glass-- it was so good, we ought to have thought ahead and just ordered the bottle
The small, medium, and larger plates presented an appetizing variety of flavors and ingredients and combinations
My friend had the ribs and edamame; I was torn b/w a tuna sashimi plate with salad, a rice paper chicken crepe with peanut sauce, fluke sashimi, and the standard and unusual array of roles
This place certainly is worth your checking out for a visit

We were the only non-Japanese people (staff to other diners) in the place, which I think is a good sign
By far the worst service I have ever experienced at a New York restaurant -- and I've lived here for years!! A group of six people ordered at 7:30 -- then waited
and waited
and waited
when food finally came out, the dishes were not brought together, but instead came staggered by 20 to 30 minutes
The waiter dropped one plate of sushi (on himself) and had to go back to the kitchen to produce another
No compensatory nibbles or drinks were supplied -- even after we indicated to the waiter that it was 'the right thing to do'
WHAT A DISASTER
STAY AWAY
I left my tip cash, payed by card
Checked my account after I got home, they re-opened my card and charged me additionaly without my authorization
Next day I went there to complain and they gave me the attitude and sent me to my credit card company
The owner woman didn't even say a bad word to the waiter who served , only with the proof they took money from me, just asked him how did that happened (in myself, after I signed the bill and left, he used his fingers and typed the code to re-open and press the amount he want to take, then you press OK and got my money
Could have been thousands!!!)
They gave me attitude instead of apologizing and having technically criminals working there
I had to call the police, next step BBB and Federal Trade Comm
This place has the worst service on the UWS - servers would rather chat than talk to you
They took our drink order 3 times but they didn't arrive until after the entre
Whoever thinks that this is typical French service either hasn't been to France or is the restaurant's PR rep
The noise here is so bad that people entered and left without ordering and they lowered the lights during the dinner
Couldn't figure that out at all
Tried it again for brunch, when the service was worse
I've never been forced to wait 30 minutes for coffee that cost as much as that
The food was average and it's close to home but totally not worth the price or effort
Although the service isn't great as they're often busy and rushing around, the food is a great deal for its price
Very classic French, well prepared and aesthetically pleasing, I don't really mind the service, as it's really no ruder/slower than service in a typical brasserie in Paris
We enjoyed Sunday Brunch here on April 23, 2006
The ambiance was lovely, chicken crepes delicious and all around great bistro
Nice addition to the neighborhood
My friends and I went into this place at around 8pm and the lighting was as normal as any restaurant
But by the time our food came out, someone had lowered the lights to a point where we couldn't see our food and I chewed into large chunks of orange peel in my beef stew that was meant for favoring
When we asked if the waiter could put the lights back on, he said:we have this complaint every night but the owner thinks it's more 'Parisian'! We said that we all have been to Paris and one even lived there for several years and we never encoutered this
The waiter said I am just a waiter!  When other patrons came in later, they began handing out flashlights
This is simply the most surrealistically idiotic place
Food is not bad but the owner doesn't think he needs patrons
The atmoshphere, the food, the staff were all wonderful
I've gone back many times
Well worth thr trip uptown
It really saddens me to say that I would never go back to this restaurant again especially since my husband proposed to me here when the restaurant first opened
Unfortunately, we like the food and the ambiance but the service is always horrible

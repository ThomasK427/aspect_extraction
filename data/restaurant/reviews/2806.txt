The food, specially the coconut shrimp I had were just delicious
Servers and managers are great and friendly
We all got out of there very happy and with some bids on our necks
I went with my friends this past saturday
It's a cozy place (very New Orleans)
Great food, not very spicy like it sounds,try the BIG EASY PLATTER good choice for sharing
Ask for the cocktail menu it has a plenty selection of drinks
Good service, food on time, for dessert I recomend the BREAD PUTTING my favorite!!!!!!!!!! Definitively I'll be back again
My girlfriend and I went here recently to try some authentic cajun food
At most, I would consider the food average
The prices weren't that reasonable, and to make matters worse, the wait staff and manager were not courteous
Recommendation - Look elsewhere for an authentic cajun experience
This is one of the worst Cajun cooking I have ever tasted
They load up the food with MSG to improve the taste
You will find yourself very thirsty an hour after you eat
Atmosphere is nice
The service is very good, the decor is very lively- and the BBQ Ribs are to die for! Order the jalapeno cheddar potatoes- My meal tasted like mom's homemade cooking!
And I'm talking about the tempurature inside the restaurant
The AC wasn't working very well but at least we were seated near a window and could open it
The food was excellent, Al
E
Gator Pops are the best, and I suggest the jalepeno chedder mashed potatoes as a side mmm mmm
The place itself is fun and great to take a date (if they like spicey food)
There's a bar downstairs and seating upstairs, a spot by the front windows at night is nice :) Dinner comes with a bread basket with corn muffins (theres chocolate on the bottom yummy)
What a nice place! From the minute you walked in
The hostess was pleasant, she took us to our table immediately
The waiter, Maurico was courteous and pleasant
He made us feel right at home with his friendly attitude
The food was excellent, the jolly ranchers drinks terrific!! The music was jamming
Since it was my friends birthday, the staff came over and sang Happy birthday for her and brought her a piece of scrumptious chocolate cake
Thanks Mardi Gras, we will be back!
Food is a little below average
Pork chops is probably the best choice on the menu
The Jambalya is spicy but worth ordering
This place has declined from few years back
but still worth going to check out
Excellent restaurant
I loved it
It had everything I wished for
The food was great, the service was great
What else can I say?
The food is just not that good to warrent the prices
It doesn't taste very authentic either
Don't waste your money
I just went for brunch this Sunday (my first time going
) Definitely get the Eggs Mardi Gras if you can
I've been to this place at all other times and the food has been consistently good
Not having been to NOLA, I can't speak about its authenticity, but if someone is really concerned about that I think a roundtrip flight is under $300
00
If not, just enjoy yourself here
GOOD OL' COMFORT FOOD at its best!!! If you ever feel like down home southern cookin' in a fun party atmosphere THIS IS THE PLACE!!! You get so much for your money and will have a good time while you eat genuine southern Cajun cuisine
Everything from Meatloaf to Crawfish to Aligator! And they have a great staff and great bartenders!!! Thursday night is LIVE JAZZ NIGHT!!!
I love their Slap Your Mama Silly Ribs
It's delicious! And their mashed potato is great too, as is their Creole Shrimp
I don't care for the interiors - kind of feel like you're eating in an attic, but the ribs make up for it
The waiters are very friendly
almost too friendly, but better than those snobby ones!
Ok, I've been to many cajun restaurants in my day and this one certainly does NOT take the cake! Although the wait staff was friendly, the atmosphere was not
The lighting is dim to completely dark and there is nothing there that reminds me of Mardi Gras
Aside from the drinks, the food is tasteless and boring considering the prices
I've had a better chicken sandwhich at Burger King!
This place is absolutely STELLAR! I love love loveee the fried rice
It's to DIE for
I think the only thing that should be changed is the lighting
it's a bit too dark in the daytijme
But I guess it's good for romantic dinners, despite what other people say
The staff is very polite and they often arrive and check on you
When they are really busy they might be a bit forgetful and neglectful, but the food is absolutely perfect
I'm a Japanese transfer student, and trust me
I KNOW good Japanese food
So try this place out
The prices are reasonable too for a poor college student like me! Arigato gozaimasu!!! ^_^
when we first walked it, a fight broke out between this mother and other gentlemen
the fight was not quite manged properly by the restaurant, the manager should've taken care of itt in a more professional manner but it took them a long time to finally calm both parties down
we sat down right in the middle of the fight, almost getting struck by the mother, ordered our drink and soup and at the same time ordered 4 6-piece rolls after waiting for about 15 mnutes for a waiter to serve us
we got our soup and drink about 10 minutes later and about 1/2 hour asking the waiter what's taking our food so long
we literally waited for over 45 minutes to finally getting our sushi which was pretty simple rolls
the waiter was not honest wtih us in the timing of our food when in fact it after saying it'll be ready in 5-10 minutes, it actually took almost 25 minutes
we walked in at 8:30pm and left there a little bit after 10pm
for a simple 4 rolls and a miso soup shouldn't take over an hour to be served
the food was definitely not worth waiting that whole hour
although we were compensated by the waiter with small beer, the wait was still not worth it
if i was to do it again, i would've gone to the place on austin street
We made reservations but were not able to get a table for the time we wanted -- we were seated at the sushi bar instead
The service was a bit slow at times
The food was decent and the portion sizes were good
The dining room seemed more like a Benihana's -- loud and festive, as opposed to the calm of a true Japanese sushi restaurant
The bento boxes were tasty and seemed to be a good deal
Okay, so the restaurant itself is nothing to look at, but the sushi is so superb that one just has to say who cares? Get the maguro and hamachi sushi plate (tuna and yellowtail)
It is so tasty and well priced
The non-raw dishes are pretty good too, but the sushi is sublime- so fresh and perfectly prepared- this place knows its fish!!!
All previous reviews of this restaurant were stellar
Did we all go to the same restaurant? Went on a Saturday evening
It took the waitress over 10 minutes to come take our order
The sake menu contained 6+ selections, but they were all out except for 2, coincedentally, the 2 available were the cheapest one and the most expensive one
The teppanyaki show interesting the 1st time during the night, but the exact routine the 2x during dinner was 'tired'
I went to Narita a few weeks ago after my sister raved about the food
We ordered the steak teriyaki and she was right, it was delicious! Their fried rice are also out of this world
The place looks really cute as well
The only down side is that our waitress ignored us the whole time

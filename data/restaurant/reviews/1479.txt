We really enjoyed three different kinds of sake
Finally their dessert was excellent, providing a gorgeous conclusion to such a great dinner
I love it
The food is exceptional
And its totally different form many other Japanese restaurants
This is the great place for those who want to try
Their sushi rolls are also superb as is their rare wakayama ramen (Japanese noodle soup)
Complimentary fresh vegetables with tasty dipping sauce served at the beginning tasted surprisingly good
Their appetizers and entres from the menu were great
King of Kimchee, actually cubes of seafood wrapped with Kimchee leaves, was the best sashimi dish I had ever had
Their Sweet and Sour Pork is crispy and sweet to its perfection
Sushi lovers should not miss their original sushi roll of fatty tuna and Japanese pickles
This restaurant is surely different form many other Japanese restaurant in New York
I went to Chanto restaurant with one of my friends last week
The design was hip and great
It looked like a bar lounge rather than a restaurant
If you dont dine and have their cocktails only, you might not come to know this place is a Japanese restaurant
The menu of this restaurant included many original dishes
I liked their signature, King of Kimchee
It was so good that I have dreamed of it twice since our visit
What my friend liked best was Hirekatsu Pork, which was tender pork cutlet
Their food was so great
We also had sushi
Although their sushi rolls have very common and boring names likes, California, Dragon, Philly, Rainbow, and so on, they tasted great
This is not a typical Japanese restaurant, but their food is excellent
We were seated on the second floor and, served by a nice, friendly guy with a skin head
For appetizers we had seared yellowtail and Signature Kimchee, both of which were great especially with their Japanese wine(rice and grapes)
Best of their main courses, I think, was Black Cod
Its sauce tasted like blue cheese, but it was made out of sake, according to our server
Sweet and Sour Pork was also good, but it was a little too much in size
I would suggest you do not try to finish all you ordered if you want to enjoy their dessert which is also amazing
This is a great Japanese restaurant
Pefect place for those who got fed up with mediocre Sushi restaurants in NYC
More adventurous dishes are available here
I had King of Kimchee
That was marvelous
It is basically seafood wrapped in Kimchee leaves
I have never had sashimi dish with such rich and original taste
Chanto's foods are excellent, especially their New York steak is compelling
The place is really beautiful and nicely decorated
I particularly liked the chandeliers in the 2nd floor dining room
The food is simply delicious and the dishes are quite big for a Japanese restaurant, I guess this is what makes this reataurant so unique
Its a cuisine made of finesse put in big plates, Lovely
The service was really good, professional, with a nice sense of humor
This is definitely a restaurant with class, expect the tab to relate it
I think its really worth it
It was last Friday night (4/14) with very high expectations for this new restaurant
We where greeted by the entire staff as we walked in
Great decor, delicious food but a bit different for those who don't like to try
Our waiter was very friendly but the management was a bit too much involved in what the waiters where doing (perhaps because it just opened)
They really made you feel like royalty
I would definitely recommend it
Didn't have a chance to hang out at the bar downstairs but it looked like a very chill spot for the summer with the large opened windows
I've been to this restaurant several times and it just keeps getting better
Wonderful food, marvelous service, sensational mojitos and the setting is simply lovely - indoors or in the garden
The food I've tasted so far - seafood only so far, eventually I'll get to the steak or chicken but the seafood continues to surpass my expectations
Definitely head here for a great meal and wonderful drink
It's happy hour in the early evening, so it's 2 drinks for 1
Just go and enjoy
Coco Roco occupies the space that Cholita filled until its unexpected disappearance in fall '05
While the service is still a bit touch-and-go (friendly but slow), the food remains excellent and an incredible value for the price
While Smith Street has a number of good options for Latin-style cooking, this one is the best for authentic South American cooking
Hopefully this restaurant will have better luck than its predecessor
I took my associates earlier this week to this new Greek restaurant in midtown Manhattan and I found the restaurant to be very nice
We started with the grilled Calamari, Greek salad was exceptional and veggie chips
All were exceptional
For entrees we tried the whole grilled fish, Barbounia and lamb
The fish was outstanding! Cooked to perfection
It was cooked properly and tastest great
For dessert the Chocolate cake with halva, and the Galactobourico were outstanding
This meal was great and not very expensive for the area
It is a great find for my company
I have been to this restaurant several times -- for lunch and dinner - and it is fantastic
Wonderful, creative menu, and beautiful decor
The grilled octopus and peach salad and the gnudi are particularly delicious
A really wonderful place
I ate dinner here with my girlfriend once
The dinner wasn't particularly memorable
As best as I recall, the food was tasty, but not significantly better than many of the other places in New York
My guess is that the increased price is sustained by ok service, upstanding presentation, and a bevy of rich, banker clients
This is a great place! Great food, great service and great atmosphere!!!! The wine manager will pick out exactly what you want in a wine
Our party had a great time
Will definately be back!
Newly opened Dona is such an amazing restaurant! I first went a couple weeks ago and had such a wonderful experience that I had to return
I dine out quite frequently and find Dona to be a restaurant that really understands what it means to make your experience unique and special
The southern European cuisine that the chef has designed is imaginative and so delicious!! Dishes to try: meze with ahi tuna and botan shrimp, octopus and peaches, butternut squash tortelli with dried cherries and walnuts and roasted shetland cod with spicy italian sausage and littleneck clams
Donatella has a winner! The menu is very interesting with selections from Italy, Spain,Greece and Portugal
I highly recommend the gnudi, the Marlin fish, and all of the desserts are heavenly
The wine list by the glass is the best I've seen in a awhile and fairly priced
I had a fabulous waiter
When I asked a question about the glass of wine I had ordered he ended up giving me the label from the bottle
Some of the bus boys need a little more training, I had to ask twice for bread, etc
But all in all a fabulous experience
I arrived without a reservation but was graciously greeted and promptly seated
Well I have been a few times in davidburkdonatella and I have to say that Donatella was really doing a great job , I don't know but my experience in Dona was really bad , cute and even sexy the dinner room , the food and service was a disgrace maybe after one week from the opening was not enough time , so please go back to work or it will be a fiasco
(like Belline)
I've been meaning to write a review on this place for a while now
I live in the area and frequently come here for dinner
It's never crowded, which I can't really understand why
I'm a sushi snob, and frankly, it's very hard to impress me

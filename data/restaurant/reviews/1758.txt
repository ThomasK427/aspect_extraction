My friend had been coming here for years, and noted that the burgers had gotten smaller
When we asked the waitress, she said the burgers were the same size, but the buns are now bigger! I don't think so
The service was sporadic and with attitude
Not at all recommended
This place reeks of a snowy/rainy, cool aftrenoon in the fall or winter
It almost seems inappropriate to go their when it's warm
The food is simple and delicious and the waitstaff is kind and prompt
This little place has been turning out the best, juiciest, most perfect iconic hamburgers your heart could dream of for over 20 years
A New Yorker's secret, perfect for a very hungry date
No wonder this place is always crowded
It serves an great variety of original American dishes and wonderful burgers, served by a competent staff
Brunch is a feast and prices are user-friendly
It's been my favorite since it opened in the early 70's
Try also the Nutella crepe or the Indian pudding
I visit Spring Joy about once a week, and I absolutely love the place
The servers are very pleasant, they remember who I am each and every time, service is prompt and the food is excellent
I would easily say they have the best Lo Mein around
The Sesame Shrimp is delicious and everything else on the menu is very affordable
I Love Spring Joy!!!!!!!!!!!!
due to the shortage of decent chinese restaurants in the chelsea area I have attempted time and time again to get what I have asked for at Spring Joy and have only received impatient looks and grunts and not what I want in asking for my order
Additionally upon opening up the take out bag the food is rarely what I have asked for
THey seem to have a problem in serving those who support their business and after giving them a second chance after months of not going there I tried again and after today the 7th of Sept
I will never give them my business
By the way they seem to have a problem with the English language, Americans, and the system that allows them to not know the language and still have a succesfull business here
Bad business - a big BOOO! to Spring Joy!
I eat here at least once a week: Cheap, generous, non-greasy and veggie-friendly, Spring Joy's $5 lunch special even offers brown rice if you want it
Plus, the selection is endless
Not bad for a corner takeout joint
In Short A rosy glow softens the scene at this casual Chelsea date spot
Its three partially divided rooms stretch straight back, beginning with a bar, then moving to an intimate stone-and-taupe area and finally to the spacious back room where a giant tangly flower arrangement towers over black-and-white-patterned banquettes
While spicy fried chicken and turkey meat loaf anchor the homestyle dinner menu and salads suit the health-conscious, it's the weekend brunch that truly brings in the boys
We love the food at food bar
Reasonably priced creative version of classic favorites
The service on the other hand
We recently had a server named Christophe for our group of six
Horrid, horrid service
Arrogant rude, we couldnt understand why he was ignoring us while the restaurant was pretty much empty - until we saw the bill - Food bar charges an automatic 20% gartuity for parties of six or more
Christophe knew he was getting paid regardless of the service level
I was embarassed to have reccommended Food Bar to friends and family
I love this place
Everything I've had here is totally satisfying (think comfort food with style!) and the price can't be beat
I often get lunch here for less than 10 bucks (ps - they have lots of veggie options too), and the folks who work here are always very nice and easy going
Even though this place is rated at $$$, it's a lot more reasonably priced
Great atmosphere
Good seating
Good for going out with friends or on a date! Calamari very tasty and not greasy at all
The service is so horrible that it overshadows the food
We waited over an hour for a sandwich and beer
The Scene In a renovated corner shop, but retaining the vintage facade, Bright is surprisingly sleek inside, with a counter, bar and comely Chelsea clientele
The restaurant draws a festive brunch crowd, but transforms gracefully into a cocktail scene in the evening
The Food The kitchen serves up ambitious Mexican fusion cuisine
Elaborately described dishes like "chipotle hoisin-marinated Murray's chicken breast on an edamame-ginger corn cake with cucumber-lime salsa" seem excessive, but somehow every combination works brilliantly
Tacos of breaded catfish with a pickled-jalapeno tartar sauce are wonderful, as is the complex, hearty green chili pozole
At brunch, the delicious pecan griddlecakes are cakey, without a hint of gumminess; the huevos rancheros, served with black beans, are as good as this dish gets
The food once again floored me
The flavors are new, fresh exciting
The combinations - flavors, textures - wonderful!!  Take a Californian here - a Bay Area foodie - and show them how truly creative Asian/Mexican food can be
Fresh ingredients, unusual combinations and strong selection of small batch sodas and juices
I discoeverd the Bright about 2 years ago and have been hooked ever since
The Mexican French toast are scrumptious, the pancakes are hands down the best pancakes I ever had, and to top it off it's one of the few places I can drink a Chicha Morada (Peruvian beverage made of purple corn)
The staff is super friendly and you never feel like your being rushed through your meal
I highly suggest the sweet potato quesadillas
Absolutley delicious
I was so full when I finished them that I couldn't even partake of the side dish of fresh-looking greens
We were promptly seated and served on a Friday night
The service was cordial but not overbearing
The atmosphere is that of a candlelit, chic diner
I had dinner with my friend here and it was the worst dining experience I've ever had in NYC
I have to admit the food was ok, not really good though
But the service was just terrible
The waiter didn't pay attention to out table at all - chips and dip (no cooking required, I think) took about 20 min, and it took about 45 min to get our entree, after I asked if we could leave cuz we'd waited too long
There was no apology or anything
DONT order chilli here
It's just too spicy without flavor
Fish seems ok here
Tables are so cramped that when a server is taking orders from the talbe next to us, his butt was over our table
Overall dishes are overpriced, and service is horrible
I wouldn't recommand this place at all
It is a little pricey at dinner--at least, more than I would expect for a neighborhood place that seems to aim to cater to locals
BUT, the food is certainly yummy--flavorful, bold, imaginative, with definite Asian and Latino undertones, as advertised
Ambience is low-key, casual, but still fun
Good for a small group of friends or a date
I LOVED the catfish taco appetizers and could make a meal of a couple of servings and be very happy
I'd come back just for those
The drinks are offbeat and interesting
And the mexican 5 spice chocolate fudge cake with the blackberry ginger salsa and white chocolate thai basil mousse was DELISH!!!
I've been to Bright for both breakfast and dinner and every time I enjoy the food, but also every time I'm unpleasantly surprised by the check
Entrees run a bit high for an everyday neighborhood place - but its worth it as a treat every once in a while
I only wish that the prices at dinner were closer to those at lunch
Food is lovely and creative, tasty and hearty
Very friendly diner feel and decent service
For a taste of the place for a much cheaper tab, try grabbing a burrito next door at Chelsea Kitchen Market - same kitchen, so same pozole, etc
!
This place looks like a diner from the outside, but it's really trying to be something much trendier
The menu here isn't very extensive and contains a lot of things that seem geared toward a more adventurous palate, but everything we ordered was fantastic, especially the quesadillas with black bean and fennel
(The oddball soda selections, including Mexican coke, are worth the trip!)
Great, innovative food -- interesting (but interesting in a good way) taste combos and ingredient choices, beautiful preparation
Wonderful services and good prices
Space is cute and clean, but too small for the demand, which is sure to keep growing
The Scene North Square's discreet, sedate decor appeals to the largley older crowd occupying the dining room whilst a younger set parties in the back bar

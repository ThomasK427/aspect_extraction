Tucked away on a great West Village street, Extra Virgin is an excellent chice for dinner
The staff was friendly and the food was wonderful and all for a fair price
Do yourself a favor and discover it for yourself
I have been to Extra Virgin twice now andf have been thoroughly impressed each time
It's the perfect West Village restaurant as it has a great atompsohere, friendly service, and terrific food
I highly reccomend the goat cheese salad - though seemingly typical salad, it is absolutely delicious with the addition of beets and green apples
The lamb shank for two on Saturday evening is also superb
I highly reccomend this place to anyone seeking a wonderful dinner at a reasonable price
What a gem! Food and service were perfect
If I had to take a client to a restaurant to impress, this would be the one
Small and intimate, the service is carefully calculated to not intrude, yet is there for you when you need them
Nice wine list
Have been three times, not a stargazer, but saw loads of celebs
I was treated as well, by the way
Arrived on a Thursday night w/o a reservation (since they don't take them for less than 6 people) and had to wait close to an hour
Space is teeny tiny so waiting at the bar meant getting poked and bumped repeatedly, but hostesses were nice and wine selection was ample
Food was the best part - my mushroom encrusted chicken was superb and goat cheese salad appetizer delicious
This was the first time I have been too full for dessert in a long time! Will definitely be back
The mussels at Extra Virgin were the best I've ever had and I've had a lot of mussels!! This is such a nice little village spot - and the service was great - our waitress was so helpful and the food was so good we could not stop eating
I have never seen cleaner plates being taken away!! Go early - we were seated right away but when we left at 9:45 there was a big crowd outside
When we first walked in, the ceiling fans above were blowing so hard they actually blew over one of the vases on one of the tables! It was very uncomfortable and not easy trying to have dinner in a wind tunnel! It took a few people complaining before they finally turned them down
Small space where the tables are just too crowded together
My husband and I both had fish dishes that were just mediocre, just okay
Nothing special and not worth the price
And a $12 margarita
are you kidding me?? And it wasn't even that good!
The food was excellent, but the overall experience was not
We went on a Friday night at 8:30 and were told that there would be a 30-40 minute wait
An hour and fifteen minutes later, we were finally seated
The table was very cramped, with almost no elbow room
Also, the loud music, combined with the noisy people around us, made it almost impossible to have conversation without yelling
Also, you should know that they only take reservations for tables of 6 or more
Great food, friendly and efficient service, hip, yet attitude-free, with a nice crowd and ambiance, and all this at reasonable prices
Try the salmon with grape leaves, it melts in your moouth
Decent deserts
Will definitely come back
Fun, happening restaurant in the West Village w/ decent food and varied menu that can make all happy
The diners are young and good-looking as is the wait staff, but it's more fun than snobby and trendy
The food is pretty good if not great, and the service is friendly but very erratic
Overall a good experience
very cool atmosphere, tight seating, very west village quaint restaurant setting, very attentive supermodel waitresses, exposed brick wall, cool-well stocked bar, friendly employees, i got the sunday night special spaghetti which was incredible (especially the softball sized meatball) and you must get if you are lucky enough to be there on a sunday night, my wife got the chicken which she said was OK
we really enjoyed it would go again
a bit pricey, but not too bad
Although it's new, the service here feels like it's been refined over time: attentive and friendly, yet not intrusive
Dishes were healthy and light, but still reasonably sized
Felt like a long time since I'd had such strong service in a new restaurant
It is very hard to choose the best restaurant in the Village, there are so many awesome places!! But this new place is waaaaaaaay up there!! My boyfriend and I tried it on a weeknight, and the service was amazing, incredibly friendly and efficient
The food is mediterranean but increadibly creative, basic fresh ingredients combined in an innovative way with a great and interesting mix of textures and flavours (none of them overpowering, they are just right!)
The ceasar salad was the best ever and the apple tartine was perrrrrrfect!!
And to make things better, the decor is homey and comfortable while cool and hip (check out the walls, they are not real wood, it is painted!!!)
Anyway, we both seriously loved it and plan to go back many more times
Great friendly neighborhood spot
Food is very good, service is even better
Making it my regular hang out spot
Give it a try, you'll be a regular too
Extra Virgin, the old Titou space opened last week
The space really looks great, warm mediterean with clean lines
And the food is great
Joey Fortunato (opening chef of Layla) is in top form
The osso buco is to die for and my favorite appetizer was the artichoke served on bed of frisee with a warm poached egg topped with parmesan cheese


yummmm


Oh and you have to try the Extra Virgin cocktail too! I'll definitely be back!
The Scene Walking the quaint streets of the West Village often leads to thoughts of times past, which is exactly the feeling at Blue Mill, with its art-deco reworking of the former Grange Hall
Standout details include polished wooden booths, beveled mirrors and shiny metal accents
At the centerpiece of the impressive bar is a vintage Parisian clock
The Food To soak up the ambience, nab a bar seat and order a fresh-squeezed margarita or the barely sweet sidecar
The drinks, served with a little extra in the shaker, anticipate the aptly executed menu, which emphasizes comfort foods of a bygone era--veggies, for example, include crisp Brussels sprouts, shredded beets and bubbling-hot scalloped potatoes
An entree of plump scallops, sauteed with morsels of bacon and served atop a corn, lima bean and tomato succotash deserves applause, as does the crispy duck, though it's more juicy than crispy
My friend and I went to brunch on a Sunday last spring and started going regularly from then on! Our waiter John was SO nice that I said I would like to come here after my wedding! When I did get married last summer, on a Tuesday in July, I decided what I wanted (as the bride) was a City Hall wedding followed by a family lunch at the Blue Mill
My husband-to-be was in full compliance!
The Tavern gave us the exact table I requested - we went there and had the most delicious french sandwiches and pink champagne
Everyone was so impressed with the choice
the waiter Ari could not have been more charming or helpful
The atmosphere was perfect and we had the most wonderful relaxed time full of fun
This has to be one of the little gems of the city
Service - awful
Went for Sunday brunch, the place wasn't crowded
The waitress was clueless - we had to ask for EVERYTHING - from silverware to sugar to ketchup mustard
The food was okay, rather cheap for the location
But it's as though someone took the old Grange Hall and cheaply put up a new restaurant with little thought given to its new identity
They should GUT the place and start over - the location is unbelievable but they're doing little to give it new life - so sad!! And the menu was VERY limited as well - and we got our cocktails AFTER we started eating - my biggest pet peeve when dining out
How can it take longer to make a drink than it takes to make a burger? Get it together, guys!
The bland food is the best thing about this place
We went for sunday brunch and were greeted by an unpleasant odor and a surly, adolescent wait staff
We would have left immediately were we not meeting out-of-towners and not wanting to deal with the usual sunday brunch mayhem
The place has fallen far since the glory days of Grange Hall
When we asked the waiter what the best thing on the menu was, he said, well, egg's benedict is the first thing on the menu
When we asked what kind of mushrooms were used in the omelette he looked at us as if we were crazy and said, they're, you know, mushrooms
this is the blue mill tavern
I've never seen a wait staff express so much undisguised digust about the restaurant where they work, and presumably eat
after long day of shopping yesterday myself and my partner decided to give the blue mill tavern in the west village a shot after reading mixed reviews we didnt know what to expect, we were greated and sitted promptly
Our waitress came over recommended some great cocktails ( we had the apple jack rabbit and the sidecar ) the music and atmosphere was wonderful
we started with beets salad and mussels both fantastic and delivered promptly for our mains we had the tuna and the prime rib ( highely reccomend the prime rib)  we skipped dessert and moved to the bar area
overall a great experience, service couldnt have been better, great vibe, excellent food we will definitely be returning soon
The worst brunch in NYC
Asked for silverware three times, drinks were all delivered separately, food came out at different times, home fries (frozen french fries) were ice cold, sausage cold and sent back never to be re-delivered, medium burger came out 15 minutes after other meals and was rare, to top it off they ran out of fries and they sent out a plate of lettuce instead! Ridiculous

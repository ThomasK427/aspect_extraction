The space has been carpeted, with excellent acoustic effect, and adorned with beautifully crafted cocobolo cabinetry
The seating is spacious
Wide table spacing provides a relaxed dining experience
But this restaurant is still about wine
The impressively well organized two-volume leather-bound list is unparalleled in depth in Burgundy and well represented in other regions
And the staff has enough wine knowledge for three restaurants
I thought that Cru would be the perfect place to take some colleagues with a passion for wine
I couldn't have been more wrong
While the food was exquisite our overall experience was terrible
One bottle of wine we ordered was corked - it smelled / tasted disgusting; cork actually fell to pieces in my colleague's hand
Unbelievably, the wine waiter refused to take it back and was very aggressive towards us saying things like, This is not a 'grand vin', what do you expect?
This for a $160 bottle of wine
To top it off, on the way out when we told the Maitre d' that the food was good but the wine was not, he replied that this had absolutely nothing to do with me
I'm generally not too bothered about service but this was a truly unpleasant experience and I was embarassed to have taken people there
there are much better places to spend your money eating and enjoying excellent wine
the service leaves a lot to be desired
your money buys you better food, service, setting, and wine at many other venues
owner/manager is neither gracious nor client oriented
The food, wine selection, and service at this place are outstanding
The interior and look of the place are the only things lacking--it's just a bit dull, but frankly it doesn't really matter
The food and wine make up for it
Everyone should aim for this place the next time you want an amazing dining experience
A real treat for wine lovers Wine bar informality with gourmet tasting dishes and extraordinary wines by the glass Service was richly informative without attitude Tasing plates @ $6 $12 - duck worth killing for Top end wines by the glass - Brunellos, Cote Roties etc The high point of a recent visit to NYC Don't tell anyone
I was shocked when I first ate at James Duane
There are only 6 tables
and 6 items on the menu
It was a perfect experience, though
amazing food, memorable wine, and teriffic service
Try the Steak Diane or the Scallops
and be sure to get some oysters
A perfect 10!
The Scene It doesn't rely on kitsch to hammer home its Englishness: instead, the sparse wood-and-tile decor verges on the generic
The loud, convivial bar area segues into the quiet dining room, detracting from the comfort of both
Service is warm, efficient and mostly British
The Food The menu sticks to the staid side of UK cuisine: no deep-fried Mars bar shenanigans here
Toad in the hole--big, bready sausages wrapped in bacon and baked in Yorkshire pudding--stands out, as does an order of flavorful rosemary-grilled lamb chops
Halibut with a bloody-Mary-inspired sauce is worthy as well
Appealing sides include a delicious potato gratin and a mash of the day
But bland beef Wellington and beef-filled miniature Yorkshire puddings uphold the stereotypes about dull English cooking
Traditional desserts, like banoffee (banana-toffee) tart and spotted dick, are rich and rewarding
The staff was wonderful and attentive
I wish it was open later
it's such a great place
You can't do better in the immediate area
The food was really excellent
you can get a bar atmosphere (modern and nice but not pretentious) and a dining atmosphere (in the back area)
It really can't rub anyone the wrong way
Went for lunch with two colleagues
We ordered from the $10
00 lunch menu
I ordered the fish and chips - and the waitress said for $3
00 more, I could get a larger piece of fish
I said sure
I can't imagine how small the fish portion on the $10 lunch menu must be if I got the large one
My colleagues ordered skewered chicken
The food was all OK, just nothing special
The ambience is calm and kitch-free
The wait staff was fine
I just can't think of a good reason to go back
The bill for the three of us with tip (I had a half pint of ale and my colleagues had diet cokes) was $55
00
I recieved a brochure about the restaurant that was very inviting, but the real draw was the 20% off with a Tribeca Film Festival ticket stub
I figured I'd give the place a try
All I can say is that it was great
The food was so good
Cool atmosphere with the bar and lounge area too
I'll definitely be back to try it for Happy Hour
It's kind of hidden from view, but worth finding
UK New York is very cozy and if you want to just chill out for a few hours, that's the place to check out
The lounge area is really nice and the chef practically caters to your needs
UKNew York is a great place to have dinner and then hang out with your friends! The Decor is really cool and the lounge area is comfortable
The food is great and the menu is alwalys changing
The chef always has fresh fish and he serves organic meats
The staff is really nice and efficient
I really have a great time every time I go there with my girlfriends! You've got to try it! When the lounge downstairs opens it will be even better!
I frequent UK New York and have seen it blossom into a really cool place to eat and drink
The new decor provides a warm, loungy and hip feel
The menu, while it has British items, is now loaded with eclectic and and imaginative dishes as well
The wait staff really attend to your needs and are ready to please
And the Scottish accent our waitress had seemed to add a touch of class to the whole experience!  In short, UK New York is a welcome diversion in an area dying for a good restaurant and lounge scene
Highly recommended
Great place to meet friends or co workers for drinks, dinner or both
Awesome atmosphere
Good food and drinks
Highly Recommended!!!
We needed a place like this
Great for a lunch meeting
Even more fun for happy hour
Food is also special
I recommend it
THANK GOD THIS PLACE HAS DONE AWAY WITH THE BRITISH ONLY MENU! The new chef and owners seem to be on the right track as most Americans and foodies do not like MOST British food
There are still some Brit food for the expats
They have hired an eccentric chef Frank Coe or Cole I think he may have won an award with the James Beard group
New York food is the menu seasonal and delicious
The Bar is very sharp with a new lounge area where our group of 20 from Bank of New York ate and drank for Thursday evening very comfortably
Wait staff is not yet polished but very nice
The bartender was very hot but needs to speed up her service
I think the food more than made up for these small problems
Came upon this place by accident in Tribeca (near City Hall)
Glad I did

Their food is wonderful and the atmosphere is casual yet impressive
I would recommed everyone try Jasmine's at least once, and I guarentee you'll have to go back!!!
very good food
a bit oily
no dish over $12
the steak-salad is great
a very active restaurant
get the sticky rice
Very good food, with a wide range of taste to choose from
Tasty wihtout being hot-spicy, and the fried dish still managed to be light, not greasy at all
And you get the whole thing for such a nice price
We'll be back there
Service is the down side: the waiter was extremely unhelpfull and couldn't care less to what we order or if we enjoy
Great restaurant on the upper east side, excellent Thai food, quite reasonable and a perfect choice to enjoy a exotic meal with a few friends over dinner
The place is also cozy and very amiable
Good place for a dinner with friends
It has it all - except a bar scene
I've been numerous times and have never been let down!
Great food, awesome prices
This place is small, cozy and serves as a great place to have a quiet dinner with friends
Love their Pad Thai -- just wish they had more vegetarian selections!
first off, when I called to place my order, the woman was rude and gave me a hard time about using a credit card
An hour later, my food hadn't arrived, so I called to check the status, and was told it was on the way
I confirmed my number and address, just to make sure
An hour and a half later, I still hadn't gotten my food
I called again, and the woman who picked up started yelling at me, saying I had given her the wrong number, my address didn't exist, that I was wasting her time, and then hung up on me
It wasn't worth the minutes it cost to call and place the order
Great food, great service, great value! Don't know what else to say besides the fact that this place is far beyond any other chinese food restaurant that I've eaten at
Waiters are knowledgeable and will help you find dishes that work together
My boyfriend and I absolutely love The Wu! I'll schlep from the UWS anytime to eat at Wu Liang Ye on 86th St
Try the Sichuan pork dumplings, the Chengdu wontons in broth
the Dan Dan noodles, and the shrimp in garlic sauce (you'll never again settle for gloppy brown Chinese restaurant garlic sauce)
The service is attentive and very polite
Now if they'd just open a west-side branch
the average Chinese restaurant
The menu is extensive and filled with unusual and sophisticated dishes
The service is always attentive, the waiters make great recommendations, and they are always willing to accommodate special requests
Somehow, the bill always seems to be less than I expect
The room is a little bland, but so what; the food is the reason to go
After a hard day's work the best place to be is Mansion Restaurant, where the sevice is with a smile, I had the spaghetti fra diavolo and it was DELICIOUS
Highly recommended
A generally decent diner, this place is justifiably famous for it's turkey burgers
Huge, homemade, and the best in town
Yes, it's true, it's better to be a regular here
But that's easy to accomplish once you're addicted to the Pasta Bolognese, which my husband and I recommend with the homemade Papardelle pasta
We have been eating at this charming neighborhood spot for two years and have only strayed from our addiction twice - both times being pleased - yet we can't get enough of the Bolognese! Mario was our favorite waiter - he welcomed us by name, like guests in a friend's home - but he is sadly gone and we have yet to bond as closely with anyone else (one of the waiters is admittedly a little grumpy, but that can be overcome with smiles)
Nevertheless, Quattro Gatti still offers a satisfying meal, in a pleasant ambience, at a reasonable price
In good weather, sit outside, and you will be momentarily transported to Italia!
Okay, Id rather pour my own wine anyway, and lack of a cooler for the white wine is no big thing
And the abrupt attitude of the waiter could be just considered professional
And I didnt mind that they seemed most attentive to people they knew
And when they brought two veal marsalas instead of one marsala and one veal medallions and the server refused to deal with it, we felt we could live with it
But when we were charged accordingly and politely tried to have the bill adjusted and were told in a nasty and condescending tone that we didnt know what we were talking about --- even though both plates featured identical scaloppini with identical mushroom and identical wine sauce --- I decided it was just not a nice place, at least for newcomers
Even the Italians from Italy vote that the food here is not so commercial and quite similiar to the cuisine they are used to at home and back in Italy, best choice for true diners with a real palate for quality food and ability to distinguish between fresh fish and meat, and commercial volume italian pasta! The food was excellent, very fresh fish and meat, excellent wines, great desserts, nothing is dissapointing int his cute upper east side italian run place, even the service and ambiance is very charming! great for a date, except be prepared for the damage on the wallet after a three course meal, it can get a little high on the price side, but definitely worth it! wouldnt recommend any other itaian restaurants in that neighbrhood,e xcept buon gusto
The atmosphere was absolutely great!! i loved the music and the drinks
The food i recommend are the seafood delight, the duck wrap and roti canai
Also, you must try the desserts
The service was pretty fast
If you're ever in the area, this is the place to go
A group of us decided to try something new
The atmosphere was ok and the music was good
We ordered soups, salads and main courses
The soup was actually good, but when the main courses arrived we were all disapointed
One of my friends decided to return her food and stay hungry
The manager came up to us and asked what was wrong with her food
She told him it was too salty
He was very angry and told us we should know what we're ordering before we order something new! The rest of us were trying to eat the salty and dry food on our plates so we politely asked him to please let us eat in peace and try to enjoy the rest of our evening
Needless to say I will never be dining at this place again
I was in the mood to try something different
and Malaysian food seem interesting
I got to penang and the food was awesome
I had basil chicken and glass of wine
and by the way about the 20% tip
apparently the new management changed it and they are not adding it to the bill any more
from my experience that a good restaurant and I highly recommend to visit there
went here for dinner last week with a friend of mine
we wanted to go out for malaysian food and this seemed to be the only restaurant in the area
the food was okay, i had a noodle dish which was decent but not very flavorful
please note that the restaurant adds on a 20% gratuity automatically
seemed a bit odd since it wasn't a big table, just the two of us
When I read through the past few reviews, I checked to make sure this was the same restaurant that I ate at this weekend
It was, and I had an incredibly different experience than the other reviewers
My friend and I were seated quickly
Our food was delicious
The dessert rocked our world
The manager kept going around the restaurant to make sure everyone was getting good service and was pleased with their food
I am from San Francisco, and am accustomed to eating really high quality Asian food, and this place did not disappoint
Have been to other Penangs in the past but this one is a bore
The decor looks like they've set up Ikea furniture on someone's patio
The tables are too small - not all of our food fit on our table
The previous commenter is correct - if you come with 5 people, you're stuck with at a table for four
The food is just OK
Service is poor - couldn't figure out who was our waiter
Luckily it's not too expensive
With all of the eating options in the neighbhorhood and in the city, this is a truly average experience
First came here a couple of years ago, food and ambience was good
Came a few more times 2-4 people, without issues
Came with a larger group a year ago, service was pretty bad (wrong, slow service and unapologetic about it)
Again in a group 6 months ago, the service was even worse this time, practically begging for water and other drinks while we waited an age just to get our orders taken
The last was a month ago

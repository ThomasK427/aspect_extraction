He pointed out on the check the tip scale 15% is $$ and 20% is $$ and asked why he didnt get the full 20% tip
We couldnt believe the dispute! After such a bad experience, never wanting to return again, the waiter actually wanted his ONE CENT
And that is exactly what we did, we gave him an additional ONE CENT to reach his full 20% tip
Yeah, this is a great place
tucked away in its little space, super warm and friendly, makes you feel at home, like its YOUR neighborhood place
which it should be, since it rocks! Good uber flavorful food, relatively cheap prices for what you get, and a decent selection of wine
Services is good, and the staff is nice and REAL
not sticky waiters or dumb amateurs, but just good cool people like you working there
go with a date, or a group
its fantastic
Flavorful curry dishes
Fresh seafood
West Village setting which means cool paper lamps hanging from walls, cozy small tables, it even has a great outdoor area in the back (great for summer)
Citysearch has too many dollar signs on it
It's affordable compared to everywhere else
Cash Only!
It has cute ambience and decent Asian food
Decor is really nice
It's a great place for just two people or a small group
This is one of the most well-kept secrets that foodies have cherished in NYC
If not, it would be like Grocery in Brooklyn! The food at Cafe Asean is to die for, and the prices are unmatchable
Romance is abound at this charming restaurant, and one will never be disappointed with a visit
Try the Mee Goreng, my absolute favorite dish in the whole entire world!
overall groovy little spot
however in the 5+ years I've been dining here the consistent rotation of snotty divaboy waiter's that are perfectly happy to obviously ignore you well
suck!!!! they're sooo not that cute
Most of the waitstaff can ruin the experience
I guess you have to come out your pocket and head to 'Jefferson's' for decent service
and to feel like a valued patron
Poor folks 'suck it up' seems to be the message here
I say
get over yourselves
I am a regular at this place because it's delicious, charming and cheap
The shrimp-scallion dumplings with the gingery soy dipping sauce are deliciously addicting and I'm not even a big fan of shrimp
The dish with lemongrass, chilies, and veggies (along with chicken or seafood) tastes so zingy and fresh
The Mee Goreng is also fabulous flavors of stir fried noodles with tofu, spices, veggies and shrimp
My boyfriend LOVES the marinated steak cubes and pork chop too
I recommend going with friends and sharing dishes to get all the flavors and find a favorite for your return!  There's also a great lunch menu until 5 PM where the slightly smaller portions but still plenty and are only about $7 - that's a deal
Okay
I can eat a lot, but these portions are ridiculously small
even for the average person
I've been here twice, and both times I've left hungry
Granted, the food is above average, but so what?! What good is three bites of excellent food when you have to leave the restaurant and head to McDonald's to fill yourself up
You know what? Eat a couple of slices of pizza before you go here, order an appetizer and an entree
and it'll all equal a regular meal
but then again, why go through all that trouble?
Cafe Asean is a wonderful, eclectic Asian restaurant with character and great food
Ask to be seated in the patio for an extra special summer evening
It's magical
The food is Southeast Asian (Thai/Vietnamese)
It will be the freshest and most delicious dinner you will have in the Village
A true gem!
A wonderful neighborhood gem! GREAT food, GREAT prices , GREAT atmosphere!!
I've eaten here multiple times now and the food is fantastic
Make sure to try any od the squd dishes as well as the salt and pepper calamri (some of the best in the city)
You really can't beat the value here, as ong as you stay away from the nightly entree specials (they're a bit pricey)
Quick service, food cooked with interesting spices and flavors, comfortable and cozy space
A great place for 2 couples to go to talk and relax
The menu offers some twists and non-traditional items
The total bill for 4 people (includes drinks, starter, and main course) was only $98
00
The only drawback is they do not take credit cards -- but there are plenty of ATMs within a block or two
Put this on your list of places to try -- you will enjoy this one!
The food is excellent and very reasonably priced, the service is always polite and astute and it's never been busy, so you can get seated promptly
I would recommend the Indian noodles with peanut sauce, it's like a spicy Indian style pad-thai
The green cury w/ tofu is also first-rate, in fact, I just had some warmed up from the other day and it was even better warmed up then when I had it there, not bad for 6 bucks
one of my fave restaurants in new york
i've had the best conversations at this restaurant, the decor is adorable, the staff is attentive and you rarely have to wait for be seated
the garden in the back is great in the summer, especially on weeknights when its not very crowded
We picked this place b/c we wanted something different
Definitely Pan Asian but food is more regional to Vietnam, Thai and on
We were promptly seated, but the waiting area is tiny almost shadowing one of dining tables
If you are seated in the Garden make sure you bring a warm coat in the cold season since it is cold even with the heater on
Also, staff is very cordial but not enough of them around if you are seated in the garden area
You almost have to wait and wait until they finish taking other orders for them to take care of your request
The sake menu could be better since it is not high quality
Also more variety in ale added to their selection may enhance the overall experience
Overall I would say it is cool
food was nice
Good first date dinner place in the warmer seasons
This is a wonderful little place
The menu has many dishes that one can't find anywhere in the city
The service is attentive and friendly; the decor is warm and inviting; and the small open air dinning in the backyard is a gem during summer
They make the most of their small space and the simple items on the menu are delicious- especially the dumpling appetizers
My pork shops were overseasoned and kinda greasy
My dining mate's fish was much better
For what it is, i thought it a little pricey but i get the feeling i had one of their few bad dishes
The Vietnamese Iced coffee at the end was nice
I came here on a double date the other night and thought it was just great
The ambience was wondering - great old tables and chairs, good low lighting, cozy
It was a bit warm though
Food was excellent
And there is a cute patio to sit out back but we didn't see it until it was too late!
Nice place, quaint, outdoor patio available, food very tasty yet moderately priced
Had a couple of appetizers there
I had the Vietnamese ravioli and the summer rolls, which were outstanding
Prices are very reasonable
Thai iced teas could stand some improvement
Also the seating is a bit cramped
One of the best-kept secrets of the West Village

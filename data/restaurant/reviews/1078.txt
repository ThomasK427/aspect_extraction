and they have a fireplace on every floor, after dinner we went up to the third floor for cocktails and sat by the window overlooking the cobblestone streets
we really enjoyed ourselves!
I don't ususally write reviews but this place deserved it
I was pleasantly stunned by the excellent food and gorgeous space
You definately have to have a genuine appreciation for food to enjoy 5 ninth
I didn't find the portions small at all
Maybe small in terms of t
g
fridays but a good portion for one person
More interesting then anything was their wine list, some really supberb wines to try
not the usual ones restaurants always choose
We enjoyed ourselves and will be back!
Unusual riffs on Asian and Western comfort classics, perfectly executed
Less adventurous palettes may be bewildered by the inventive combinations and textures, and scenesters put off by sedate service more typical of better neighborhoods
But this is excellent food in a tasteful atmosphere, perhaps a little too much class for the meatpacking district or just ahead of its time
Absolutely terrible experience
Bad, overpriced food, sub-par service
I am being absolutely honest
I hate writing reviews
but it was so bad that I have to save others from this joke of a place
if you are the kind of person that would pay $32 for sticky rice, then go ahead
mediocrity is the game at this place
boring fish and appetizer dishes and lame sides
cannot believe we went there
I visit this place on a regular basis and simply adore the food
They take simple dishes and combine ingredients that make the food taste divine
Incredibly fresh such as their Alaskan Salmon and their lamb dishes
I enjoy having cocktails at the bar and a quite bite as well
It is not overrun by the normal meatpacking groupies and they manage the door very well
Although service has had it's issues from time to time, it's my favorite local spot
A group of 6 dined at 5 Ninth this evening and it was one of the worst experiences I have had in New York
The food was terrible, extremely fatty cuts of lamb
undercooked fish
we complained about the lamb plate the Maitre D refused to take it off the bill as I had eaten it all
Which I hadn't done more than move fatty pieces around
So all in all the food was terrible the service was rude and none of us would ever return
Which is a shame, because the ambiance was great
First of all, please, let there be light! We sat in the garden and couldnt even read the menu
Does it cost so much money to give us a little more comfort for the price they are charging?  Appetizers were passable, Main dish: A COMPLETE DISASTER!! It's an insult that they call this food Asian
Meats were so fatty I couldnt eat most of them
Decent chef should know at least how to trim the fat or cook it long enough so it doesnt taste so nasty
It was so dark I couldnt see what I was doing and end up eating the fatty meat I had to stop eating eventually
The fish had a weird taste like it wasnt cooked through
Ive been to many bad restaurants but never had a food so bad that I couldnt eat
This over priced restaurant is by fat the worst experience!
Ate here last Friday night after meeting friends for drinks up on the 3rd floor
Plain and simple: do not judge a book by its cover! Firstly, we were seated outside which was quite pleasant, our table was lit with a small lamp - Problem no
1: we couldn't read the menu as it was way too dark, Problem no
2: we couldn't see the food we were (trying) to consume, Problem no
3: there was so much fat on both our meat we had to resort to spitting it out (since we couldn't see what we were eating), Problem no
4: snobby wait staff, slow and inattentive, Problem no
5: expensive for small portions ($30 main which was mostly fat??)
5 Ninth Just because you're located in the Meat Packing district doesn't give you automatic rights to stardom
The worst restaurant I've been to for quite sometime
Have you ever had the feeling after leaving a resaurant that you have just been taken
well, this is definately a suckers palace of the highest proportions
While the food was flavorful, the portions were tiny
This restaurant has taken the trend of serving tiny portions on oversized plates to a new level
How small are the portions you ask
well, they are so small that you could eat your entire meal in one bite
I am not kidding
On top of it all the service was just marginal
Ok, it was just down right snobby
Over the last 10 years, I have traveled to over 30 countries, countless cities and eaten at a good number of excellent restaurants
Needless to say, 5 Ninth was not one of them
Unfortunately, everyone at our table had to pay $100/head to figure this out
the host nose was up the air
waitress had attitude problems
then if you tip 15%
they will chase you after for more
Foods were OKAY
nothing so special
Granted, I have a friend who's a sous-chef here, but everything about the place rocked
Beautiful setting, very out-of-character for MePa (thank God)
Great wine selection
Wonderful service
And the food! I had the opportunity to try the lobster/pasta dish, which was awesome
The hanger steak was tasty, but sensitive palettes beware! It's spicy! And the desserts are to die for
The mint/chocolate chip ice cream dessert is by far the best
Overall, the menu selection is extremely eclectic and should be able to please everyone
The space is small, so I recommend going on an off night your first time to really get a sense of the knowledgeable wait staff and killer eats
I almost didn't choose this restaurant based on previous reviews
Ambience: We sat at a table for two on the wood deck that leads down to the patio
The restaurant has a wonderful open-air feeling, no matter where you sit
Food: We ate mostly seafood, and it was all good - excellent
The sauce on the scallops was a little odd, but still good
The main dishes were excellent
The lobster with noodles was fantastic! It's not large portions, but then again, you're not at Sizzler! At the end of the meal we were full
We also had the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer
delicious!!! They actually forgot to put that in with our order, and three different people came to apologize for this mistake!  Drinks: If you like a strong cocktail, this place is for you
The Improved Gin Cocktail packs a punch! The Poloma was salty and tasty!
My friends and I went to dinner last weekend and had a great time
We were greated and brought to our table by one of the most beautiful and friendly hostesses ever
The wine and food we were recommended was great
I really have no complaints except that we were a little cramped at our table upstairs
Great music and great ambience as well
Run from this place
Beautiful yes but the sinister host and staff are not there for your dining pleasure
A group of four the staff never stopped interupting our conversation
The bread and cheese spread droped on the table the waiter schmeared it all over our table in front of each of us and left it there , we wiped it or we would of had cheese on our arms

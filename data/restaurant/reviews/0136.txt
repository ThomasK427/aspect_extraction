This would normally be a good thing, but the restaurant is so incredibly loud that we could not carry on a conversation over the table
At the end, I left exhausted from the noise level
The food was very good if you don't count the steaks
The steaks are fairly tasteless
However, the fish and crab are good, as are the appetizers such as crab cakes, scallops, and shrimp
Thus, this is is only steakhouse where I recommend that you order the seafood
The service was fairly effective
The drinks were interesting and very expensive
I would recommend coming here for a bar night, but not for dinner
dylan prime meets and exceeds my requirements for a five-star dining experience
the serivce is exceptional, food is outstanding, and the wine list is very carefully chosen
the restaurant has a wonderful ambiance accentuated by fantastic music selection
the best part is that casual attire without reservations will not be turned away
my trips to NY always include dylan prime!
I'm always in search for a great Martini, this place get's a two thumbs up
The bartenders really know there stuff
The Cosmo's are perfect, i even learned a trick from the baretnder in makeing a perfect Cosmo
The bartenders are friendly, the ambience is dark, yet romantic
Crowd and music are good as well
I have been to Dylan many times and was so pleased with the experience we had on Saturday night
The staff was attentive and accommodating, we were seated right when we arrived
The waitress was very helpful in selecting wine for the evening as well as recommending specials and pairing our entree's with a variety of sauces and chapaeux(s)
This was quite a feat considering we had such a large group! We consistently taken care of throughout the evening
Our steaks were done absolutely as ordered, and delicious
Extremely impressed!
I recently took a group of out-of-town friends to DP based solely on Citysearchs review
Big mistake
I was completely embarrassed by the loud Webster Hall-like music, and I was shocked to look around me and see that I was surrounded by a decidedly BT crowd
So much for New York sophistication
The steak was decent, although our appetizers and side orders were completely average
The service was without a doubt absolutely disastrous
Our marathon three-hour dinner included having to ask several times to have our finished plates removed and waiting incredibly long stretches of time between courses
The wine list is horrible- everything we chose under $100 seemed to be magically unavailable
Our waiter wouldnt have known the difference between a Syrah and Shiraz if it bit him on the hiney
The sommelier failed to appear at our table despite numerous requests
Skip this place and go somewhere else
Dylan Prime is one of an increasingly small number of restaurants in NYC that take reservations for large groups
Don't let that fool you into thinking this restaurant is good for groups unless you want to scream over the table at your fellow diners and wait at least 15 minutes for a wine glass to appear on your table
Dylan Prime is loud (both the acoustics and the cheesy music) and the service is horrible
The wine list is disappointing and some of the wines on the relatively small list are not even available
The wine prices are ridiculous -- one bottle that retails for $25 in New York was on the list for over $90! Wine service was horrible as well
The food was decent but by the time you get to that, who cares?
What a great restaurant
the portions are plenty
Not sure what everyone has been talking about
We each got the 11oz filet and we shared two sides plus we both got soup and we were plenty full
The food was fantastic and so was the service
I proposed a few hours earlier and they made sure we got a great booth
I would definitely go back
with drinks for both of us the bill was around $150
The meat served at this trendy, yet out of the way eatery was close to a normal portion size, rather than the standard bigger than the plate offerings of other established steakhouses, and was prepared close to as ordered
The tiny sides were tasty, but you need more than one for more than one
The Dylan steak sauce is excellent
The wait staff seemed inexperienced, e
g
no specials were offered until asked for; we went through two waiters before a third was presented who knew something about the wine list
There is not much wine on the list under $100, of which they were out of some, but could not say which
Our experience was very average with a high price tag - you do the math
The ambience, food, and service were divine
We dined there with our out-of-town guests and were impressed with tatsy selections of chapeau and the bearnaise, peppercorn, and buerre blanc sauces
The filet mignon was perfectly crusted with maytag blue cheese and chive
Loved the potatoes and the almond green beans
The dessert is crucial and make sure to save room for the tasty cake-tails and Pie-tinis
Beautifully lit and romantic
Looking forward to many more visits
i went on a thurs night and it was a bit loud due to the many businessmen eating their dinner, but the food and service more than outdid the lack of peaceful dining
our party had steak and fish and everything was absolutely wonderful
i would not recommend Dylan's Prime for a nice romantic meal, but if you want great food for a fair price, this is the place to be!
very good service, wine, filet mignon, tuna tartar, deserts
just a great place
I recommended this place to a good friend who is a fellow steak lover and he was amazed on how the steak was and sauses sides etc
very dark and sexy
the bar on the other side is usually packed too
overall great
What a great find
Fabulous Service/attentive wait staff
Loved the Mojito! Lobster Salad and Carpet Bagger Steak
What more could you ask for? Barely needed a knife for steak which was wonderful
Overall Great Experience
Will go back and would recommend
Only drawback was a bit stuffy in dining room and wish we knew the lounge was around the corner with a full menu---discovered on the way out
Depends on what you're looking for but check both before you settle on one
The waitress helped us pick the perfect wine to go with each of our entrees
The entrees blew each of us out of the water as each plate was prepared perfectly
The martinis were also a huge hit with the table and it's tough to beat a place where all of the patrons seemed to always be smiling and laughing
Parking was also unbelievably easy to find
We left with one of the finest dining experiences of our young lives
DP is a hidden treasure -- service was excellent, decor was great
Food was fabulous
It's $$, but you get what you pay for at DP
Went for our anniversary and absolutley loved it
The cheese fondue was mouth watering, the carpet bagger was out of this world, and the drinks were fantastic
Wish we left room for dessert
We will definitely be going back soon
This is a great place for a romantic date or a large group
Highly Recommend!!!!!!!!!!
Our friends brought us here for the first time the other night
We had a blast
It was a great interactive dining experience
The family style serving of the big martini, fondue, side dishes and dessert was so much fun

The brick-oven pizzas are good because they are made from the bread
I usually have the shrimp fra diavolo, which has not disappointed me yet
It's got great classic Italian dishes, and a nice Italian feel
I definitely recommend
When we first moved to the 'Ridge this was our favorite restaurant
But, alas, no more
The kitchen seems to screw up our order literally half of the time
Our last dine-in experience was the last straw -- my wife's entree arrives, but oops, mine was never put in
Manager couldn't be bothered to come over and acknowledge the mistake
They have a nice menu but they don't know how to run a restaurant
Goodfellas is like my 'old faithful' Italian restaurant in Bay Ridge
They have all the classic Italian dishes, and all are great
I eat there often, and get food delivered even more often
I have had Goodfellas at least 30 times, and I have been please every time
One of their best qualities is their cost
everything on the menu is reasonable priced
If you are looking for some classic Italian food in Bay Ridge, then Goodfellas is the place to go
Try the Chicken Goodfellas it was excellent
It is definately worth checking out
Parking in Bay ridge is always an issue, so you might as well just walk from home
There are many places in the neighborhood for after dinner drinks
(and dancing, if that's what your looking for)
The Scene It's the liveliest spot along Bay Ridge's thriving Third Avenue dining scene
Gussied-up Gen-Xers nosh on homemade potato chips and mingle to piped-in pop music in the bar's oversized booths
An elegant dining room, with flowing satin drapes, a flickering fireplace and dramatic ceilings frescoed with abstract aquatic art, is far more formal than the leafy outdoor patio
The Food The seafood-dominant fusion menu features standout starters, like super-fresh raw bar oysters, crispy citrus-pepperoncini calamari and flaky lobster-mushroom tart with fiery chorizo and caramelized onions
Pastas include shellfish-stocked linguine with tomato sauce, and an excellent homemade cheese ravioli--all are available in half portions
The best of the oversized entrees include supple roasted lobster and grilled filet mignon with incredible pancetta-scallion mashed potatoes; horseradish salmon sweet-tempered with apple hash; and Parmesan-basil lamb over creamy polenta
Finish with "Danny's Balls"--deep-fried, doughy spheres filled with melted chocolate
Reading their on line menu, I decided that this was the best place to host Father's Day brunch
When we arrived, it turns out their menu was no longer the same menu they had
Our waiter was nice enough, but I had to ask for coffee 3 times
We asked for water for the table and got one single glass for 7 people! The prix fixe brunch is $18 which includes juice, mimosa, coffee, etc
A couple of folks requested soda instead
The soda was served in small 6oz glasses and we were charged $2
50 per glass
The pancakes plate is 3 small, silver dollar size pancakes for that price
The food quality is good, but the prices are not worth it!
Let me start of by saying that I don't know how this restaurant was given a yes to prompt seating - we arrived at 9:00pm for dinner and were not seated till 10:30pm
I understand that we did not have reservations, and maybe they were busy and it was going to be a long wait - However, be HONEST say that from the beginning
we should of left after 30 minutes of waiting but we had read all these really good reviews
Let me just say
I now regret that we did not leave and go to another restaurant
We finally were seated after an hour and 1/2 in a table in the corner by the stairs, near the kitchen, on top of one another
IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO FEEL LIKE A RESTAURANT IS DOING YOU A FAVOR BY LETTING YOU DINE THERE
THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR YOU!!
Everything was excellent, but the waiter couldn't take a hint
When we say we love parmesean cheese, please leave it on the table!!!
We went on a Saturday night
We were told a 20 minute wait, tops
Thankfully they have a great bar with excellent service
2 1/2 hours later we were given a wonderful table by the fire place
The waiter appeared promptly, took our order, bought us drinks and was never to be seen again
Food was good, but in my opinion, a bit pricey
The place is beautiful
We did have a great time
even with all the noise!
I highly recommend the pearl room
I have been to the pearl room a few times with different people and everyone seems to love it
Everything about the pearl room is great, the food is delicious the service is wonderful and the place is beautiful
Highly recommended by many
I still can't figure out why
The crowd totally from the early bird special world out of Florida
The food was below average , I'm not a great cook and I could have cooked a better meal
The shrimp was bland and the risotto had no taste
The grilled vegatables had no taste
The steak just sucked
The waiters well just pick one they don't stop coming over to the table
And what's with the horrible array of music being piped in
My advice stay home and save your money
The evening my husband and I visited the Pearl Room, it was filled to the max, fine
It was very loud, I was privy to everyone's conversations around me and then some
Which was a little like being on the set of the sopranos
The waitress, although friendly, was no where to be found; we sat with our menus for 45 minutes
The calamari was fantastic! The decor is great as well
Our main dishes were bland and boring, and cold
I did not find it romantic because I felt like I was hanging with Joey and Paulie and Gina and the rest of the family
I would not recommend this spot for dinner
However, the bar would be perfect to meet friends or a date before going to dinner elsewhere
I entertained clients at the Pearl Room on a Thursday evening
The staff was extremely attentive and polite
The food was excellent
Anthony Rinaldi made frequent trips to the table to ensure everyone was pleased
I highly recommend this resteraunt to anyone entertaining business guests, especially out-of-towners
Romantic environment and great service
Great place to go to even for a cocktail and some appetizers
Waiters and waitresses are always attentive and professional
Food is excellent
Chef Anthony is warm and is always fixing up something unique and tasty in the kitchen to send to your table
He is a gracious chef who comes to the table and greets the guests
You will always find a fun crowd at Pearl Room
It is also nice to see a place in which people from all ages enjoy Bay Ridge together
This is by far the best restaurant I have ever been to
The food is amazing
The staff is so wonderful and attentive
I can't wait to go back
This place is guranteed to be a great meal and a great time
The food, the sence, the service words could not even begin to express how unbelievable everthing is, you will just have to go their for yourself!
I find the Pearl Room to be a fabulous restaurant with excellent food,good service and a lovely ambience
I recommend it highly it's one of my favorite restaurants in brooklyn (THAT SAYS ALOT SINCE IM A BAY RIDGE GIRL BORN AND RAISED)

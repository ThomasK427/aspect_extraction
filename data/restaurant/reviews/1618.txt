The place was great- food was great, service with a smile and it is a great romantic date place
I live in the neighborhood have been a regular at Jules for a year a half
Authentic French bistro ambiance that doesn't quit; friendly barmaids; cool froggie electronica
Free homemade toasts with olive tapanade, goat cheese eggplant puree are aswsome before about 7:30 p
m
, after which they dry out
Roast chicken over mash is great, as are the duck confit lamb stew
Well-priced pre-theatre menu
Passable wines by the glass; fresh tap beers; nice calvados armagnacs; tasty champagne cocktails; so-so sangria
After 9:00, free live jazz seven nights a week (always organic Afro-Cuban, Brazilian or Gypsy guitar swing ala' Django Reinhardt)
A truly cool subterranean French jazz bar eatery on St
Mark's Place
I keep going back recommending it (and walk my golden retriever past every night of the year and wave at 'em
)
Mediocre french food and mixed service
Only great dish was the steak tartare but they randomly take it off their menues
Mussels were suspiciously huge and tasteless, pate was bland
Wine overpriced
Vibe can be fun, especially when they have live music, but overall, average
This is a FRENCH-THEMED restaurant, not a FRENCH restaurant
With the boring food, the easy-listening jazz, the retro-1950s feel, and the corny French street signs on the walls, it feels like you've stepped into French World at Epcot Center
The maitre'd apparently decided that blatant rudeness was part of the act: he seated us at a lousy table, then loudly berated us when we moved to another empty spot nearby (he said it was reserved, but then he never seated anybody there, and the restaurant was far from full)
The food was serviceable but boring
The waitress was nice, but her priority was clearly upselling expensive wines
This place has no idea how to treat its customers
JULES STINKS
When asked to be moved to one of the million empty tables we were barked at by the maitre d'/manager-on-a-power-trip that they were all reserved, so very busy, blah, blah, blah
So we stayed in the first of three empty deuces in the back
We cheated and slid into the middle table 20 minutes later we were very loudly and VERY rudely scolded (why you sit here when I sit you there? I say to you there are reservations and you move, no you must be where I put you
etc
) and made to slide back, because THAT table was also reserved
This would not have ticked us off so much if he wasn't such a jerk about it AND NO ONE EVER SAT THERE ANYHOW!  Food was good, not exceptional
Our Cindy Lauper-meets-Cindy Brady waitress was darling and helpful
Too bad her boss is a pill
We went here for Christmas dinner last year and had a wonderful time
We had the escargot, boullabaise and filet mignon
Only prob was owner's French friends smoking next to us in non-smoking section
Ah, the French!
I am french, and I hated Jules
The waiters were french and yet persisted in speaking english to me! They were rude, brought me the wrong order and contradicted me
(For the record, a croque madame is a croque monsieur with tomatoes, not an egg
)  Don't go
Being French is no excuse for the lousy service that we received
Yes, our French friends are known to show a little attitude from time to time, but they do understand the basics of the dining experience - something neither our waitress nor the maitre d' seemed to
Rude, inattentive service, endless waits without any explanation for the food, an inability to respond to our complaints
Yes, the food was excellent once it arrived, but you've got to be some kind of sucker to live with such terrible service just to get decent food
This is NY, after all, so we have plenty of choices
I'd say, try somewhere else - this is too much of a lottery
live jazz - gooood
cozy ambiance - goood
dessert - goood!! a great overall night out!
Somehow, my friends and I always end up here when we go out
Stepping inside is like being transported to a European cafe
The service is a bit hurried yet friendly and attentive
The choices of wine seems never ending and the food is great
Add a live jazz trio to the mix and you have a perfect night
For the price, you would expect at least adequate service
Not here
Not only did our server tag team serve us with the ladies RIGHT next to us, he didn't offer us specials, so we assumed there weren't any
(We found out later there were
Then (here's the kicker), when I figured out the reason that I didn't like the bottle of wine we ordered, I pointed it out to him
The red wine was cold from being in the cellar
white wine cold
When I pointed this out to him, the response was, Well this is New York
Leave it on the table for a bit and let it warm up
Yes, I should have noticed it right away, but that's not the point
Then he was inattentive for the rest of the evening
Honestly the WORST service I have ever had in NYC
Food was good, though
I have been to Jules several time with my friends and we always have an amazing time there
The music is great and the food is typically divine, especially the tuna tartar, which should not be missed! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!
i have been to jules maybe 8 times in the past 3 years
sometimes it can be amazing, sometimes not so great
occasionally i get thrown at the crappy table, rushed, etc
then there are times like when my date and i asked for the check sans desert and the maitre d' insisted on serving us a delightful aperatif on the house
they just re-did the menu- steaks are nothing special, the frites arent as good and they got rid of their one vegetarian dish
all in all, be safe and make a reservation, the bread is amazing, and the wine is all fantastic
sure, it's romantic, but it can be loud at times
the live jazz is always great but then the musicians beg for tips
sit outside
or hang at the bar
oh yeah and bring ca$h
All was well until maitre d' asked us to leave as a big table was coming in
We had been there only one hour and 15 minutes and just been served coffee and had all (4 people) ordered 3 courses and a $45 bottle of wine
We felt rushed and will never go back
Never eat such bad steaks before
After complain about it we get a new one
Wasn't much better
Just stay away from this place
With a city the size of New York, chosing a restaurant can be a frightening task; you never know when you will end up in an over-priced greasy-spoon
On my first visit to Jules', I all of my fears melted away
Great restaurant for dates, friends, or just relaxation
Unbelievable food and great prices
I will be in town again soon, and have already made reservations
A+!!!
I met my friends here for a birthday dinner and it was a big hit
Everyone in the group enjoyed the delicious food, the wine was amazing and the atmosphere was great
Definitely a winner
which means that the food is terrific, but the service is not
But don't be turned off - this place is worth the slow-going attitude and sometimes spotty services for its delicious French classics like the steak frites, duck, escargot

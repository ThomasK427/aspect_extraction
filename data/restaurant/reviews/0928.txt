The Sake Black Cod was sub-par and the Sea Eel Tempura was like a supermarket fish stick
The sushi was good, but the piece are the smallest that I've seen in NYC
Trust me, given the prices, this place just isn't worth it
There is much better sushi all over NYC
The atmosphere is good, but we were seated in the side room, not the main dining room
And, it was dull in there
Matsuri is the kind of place you go to check out the amazing interior and people watch
Made res on a Sat
night and had to wait 1/2 hour for our table
Restaurant is gorgeous but don't expect great things from the food
My miso cod was sub par and sushi was ok
Even the chocolate dessert wasn't worth the calories to finish
But the space is so great that you'll just sip your drinks, enjoy your company (hopefully), and watch the people around you
On a not too busy Thursday night in May, myself and 3 girlfriends decided to try the place out
We all loved our food but the service we all agreed was not
When showed to our table, we requested one of the two empty booths which would be more comfortable right next to the table we we're going to be seated at
The hostess walks away briefly, returns and says they're being reserved for a parties of six
Not long after, a party of four was seated by the same hostess
I've been to Matsuri on both weekends and weeknights
While the service can vary, the food has been solid on every visit
I've had some awesome small dishes, esp
a chawanmushi with shellfish and black truffle oil
The sake list is simply one of the best I've seen outside of Japan, with over 100 bottles
The sushi, however, was not as good as some of the other places in the city
The room is enormous and stunning, leading to a fun albeit noisy experience
Been to Matsuri multiple times, all during the week, avoiding amateur nights on the weekends: that might explain why my experience is so different than the past couple of reviews
Food is simply divine (Yellowtail, Kobe beef, Sake Cod)
Service is superb, even the door on busy nights has been more than accomodating (They keep tables upstairs for walk-ins, can hang out or even eat at the bar)
Leave room for deserts, and try the sampler
OK, it's not cheap, but you DO get your money's worth
The bar is also quite happening, both sides of it!
Honestly, I am suprised how many people liked Matsuri
When the Sashimi app
Special I ordered came out within a minute I was a little weirded out
it must have been sitting around because the fish was slimy and very fishy
Saki way overpriced by the glass
I ordered the Sushi sampler entre - It came out with 5 peices of sushi! Oh, I forgot my Lobster soup- It was ok I guess, nothing I would order again
Needless to say, I left $100 poorer and very hungry
The service was as good as the food
Matsuri is phenominal
I go out to eat quite often and Matsuri is one of my favorite restaurants in New Yok
The sushi melts in your mouth, the sake is exceptional and the waitors are well educated about the menu and very polite
The shrimp tempura, sushi, and crab udon noodle soup special are must haves
And the atmoshphere is perfect for any occasion
trendy yet classy
It is on par with Nobu and much better than Megu and Bond Street
Loved it and cannot simply wait to get there again! Maritime is so so spiced up!!
Obviously, the other nasty reviewers are biased and had one bad experience( I bet they work at spice market, LOL)
(*ps: if your reservation is lost you should see the maitre'd, NOT a hostess, DUH) It is not easy to get rsv on the main floor, since a lot of celebs visit - so don't count on main floor seating
The bar view is just as nice, and wide! The food was great and diverse
Our server (His name was marcus I think) was SO wonderful and accomidating
The music is very loud so it is hard for service to be impeccable - many times it was hard to hear him and vice versa, but overall it was a FAB experience and we've been back 3-4 times!
Granted the the restaurant is beautiful but when it comes to bad service, it is far from worth it!!!! My reservation was lost and the hostess was not only unhelpful but was absolutely rude
The manager should wise up and change the hosting staff!!!
The space is cool, but the food and service were awful
What a waste of money
Someone said that the cod was like Nobu -- it was as far from Nobu as you can get
I would never come here again - it's awful
Totally agree with the previous two reivews
this restaurant may represent nice ambience however, more or even totally new training of waiter and waitress is definitely required
service is terrible, it's beyond description
Matsuri is a beautiful space but the people who fill it and the management staff are horrible! My friends and I had a 10:15 restaurant but were not seated until after 11:00 (without apology)
Then we sat unacknowledged at our table for 15 min more
After a fork was dropped on the head of my friend (again without apology) we left
Bad service, ugly unhip crowd, and feckless management - STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!
The attitude at the door was horrendous
My party of four had a reservation and arrived on time, but got sent to the back room despite a number of open tables in the main room
When we asked, twice, to be moved, we were told they could not guarantee anyone a table in a main room
However, they couldn't move us because they were guaranteeing those same tables for other parties! The attitude we received from the hostess reeked of a small person on a power trip in her own little fiefdom
When the flame dies down in 6 months, don't call me!
Upon entering Matsuri, I already felt I was going to be transported into a very special place
The descending staircase takes one into a Zen like temple, simple yet grand
We sat downstairs and the place was bursting with atmosphere
From the wood-beamed ceiling to the bathroom frescoes, no detail has been spared
The food was excellent
New York has been starved for an izikaya in a bustling setting, without Nobu prices
We had a sampling of oshitashi, yellowtail sashimi, a well done spicy tuna roll, and an excellent unfiltered sake
My only disappointment was when the sushi chef told me they didn't serve nato
He said it will be there next time I visit! Matsuri is a feast for the eyes and the senses
Go there now
Some flavor combos are tasty, but the portions are LAUGHABLY SMALL
Skip the pear martini (which strangely tastes like lemonade) and get the midori martini, which is like a tasty, apple-green alcoholic slushee
The fried whole fish is completely rubbery, although the sake marinated fish is very creamy and rivals the miso-marinated cod at Nobu's
Really expensive, some dishes are hit-and-miss
Not the first place I'd recommend
Plus you get all the wanna-bees who go to places like The Park
the decor of this place is so cool, without being pretentious
and the food is great
i tried the mushrooms small plate, sake black cod, lobster miso soup, edamame and mt
fuji dessert (meringue shaped mountain filled with whipped cream and chestnut paste)
everything tasted amazing but not overpowering
and the service was very good
though you won't leave stuffed (portions are on the smaller side), you'll leave very satisfied
went there on friday night with my boyfriend
very modern and fashionable japanese restaurant
bar area is nice for after work drinks
if you want to sit down and eat, making a reservation in advance is must
food was great, our waiter was attentive, but not annoying
i would go back there again!
These negative reviews must be due to a brand new restaurant working out it's kinks because this place was amazing ESP THE SERVICE

Wow Truly a great find
Good lunch value right in midtown
I was walking casually past the front after meeting with some co-workers at the UN and saw this magnificent flower arrangement inside, i checked out their menu and decided to have dinner
The place was quite relaxing and elegant, the service was remarkable and their menu quite diverse, which is great
since most high-end restaurants do not step outside of the cream base meals
this was truly a find
I really recommend this place for anyone, not necessarily a place for kids, but definitely for adults and business
they do indeed have a really good wine list
The best chocolate I have ever tasted
Simply delicious! A really warm service in a nice environment
I went there this past weekend together with some friends
We were all impressed by the value of the menu as well as the fantastic food that we had
They have a really great Pomengranite Martini which I reccomend to all
Thier coffee, which I think they make themselves, is truly top notch and def
one of the best that I've had
All in all I truly reccomend this place
Get there b4 everyone else does
I decided to try Las Ramblas after reading their review in the 'Under $25' dining section of The NY Times
I must say, my visit exceeded my great expectations
With a wide array of food and wine, cozy atmosphere and warm, friendly customer service, Las Ramblas is on the fast track to becoming the hottest tapas bar in NYC
I suppose this food passes for real tapas for most American customers but any self-respecting Spaniard would certainly turn their noses up at this mess
The potatoes and omelette were sadly lacking and disappointing, the Sangria lacked the proper amount of alcohol and the finishing touch of brandy
Shrimp in garlic sauce was just that with nothing at all to distinguish it; this place is SO overrated I can't believe it
The chef must have just come from a short order diner as there is no originality here whatsoever
Joined some friends for a birthday party here, and although it is not the best space for groups, they did a great job accomodating about 15 or so people coming and going throughout the evening
I was impressed with their flexibility
Delicious tapas (generous portions no less), out of this world sangria and fabulous service
So glad the birthday girl introduced this place to me - I can't wait to introduce it to others!
So, I went there on my Birthday last Friday
I spoke to Natalie maybe a dozen times to make sure that she would be able to sit my 11 ppl party -I specified that it was my birthday and I wanted to have fun and that I was willing to wait 30-40 minutes or so but no longer
I asked her to be honest and tell me the truth of whether or not she had the space for us and when is the BEST time to arrive
She assured me that she has the space and to arrive at 9, soooo, when I came there with my whole party of 11 at 9 sharp, I wanted to cry
MY LIVING ROOM IS LARGER THAN THE RESTAURANT!!!! I simply did not know how she would fit us, and it was too late to go elsewhere, so 1 hour and 38 minutes later we were seated
I actually had guests who felt claustrophobic there
We had 3 bar style, tiny round tables, for every 4 people
it was awful!!!!!!!!!! I wish I was told the truth that the max capacity of the place is 20 ppl at it's best!!! This taught me an EXCELLENT lesson to check out the place thoroughly before I make any arrangements to go there
O, and on top of that
there were not enough menus for us
and the check was attached with a paper clip so when I paid my bill in cash, and attached it to a paper clip, I was actually asked why I left such a small tip AFTER they misplaced the money that I gave them
I counted it several times, and it was the right amount not my fault they lost it
Lesson #2 pay with a card so there is no discrepancy
I have to say
THE FOOD AND THE DRINKS are AMAZING, but iw as left with a very sour taste in my mouth
if she would only tell me the truth when i arrived there that the wait would not be 20 minutes but over an hour and a half
I would appreciate that even more!!!!!
fabulous food, great wines (and well priced) and such enthusiastic/informative service - i feel like i am getting free spanish lessons with my dinner! rigo and john are too wonderful for words - highly recommend
just not on mondays (which is when we go so i want you to stay home so we can get a good table!!)
I went to this place with my girls and we loved it! Its definitly not a place for a big group, but the food is amazing! The staff is so friendly and on top of everything! Natalia is the sweetest server i ever had
Fernando is the best Tapas Chef in New York! This is a place you must try! Excellent
Cant wait to go back
Nothing negative to write about this restaurant
The place is small, but wasn't crowded when we went on a Saturday night
Very romantic setting
The prices are very reasonable and the food is phenomenal
The duck sausage with quail eggs is outstanding! The staff was extremely friendly, and knowledgable about the dishes and the wine list
This place definitely has the best tapas in town, no need to ever go anywhere else!
This place was great! The food ,service and wine were all fantastic
This is now the only tapas bar I will visit in town
it was just that good
The dishes were all prepared perfect
The staff was very helpful and friendly
Only draw back to this place was that its small however everything was so good it didnt matter that much
Small place with big things to offer!!!
A serious kitchen is producing quality food at this new little restaurant
Candle-lit and romantic, this place sells many wines and provides first-class service
A must visit
Hands down the best tapas in manhattan! We ordered about 6 selections and all were fabulous
The hostess/waitress was extremely pleasant and informative
The space is small, but in a good way (if that makes any sense)
The drinks, the staff, the atmosphere, and of course the unbelievable food, makes this restaurant one of my favorites!!

What a nice surprise to find this little tiny restaurant serving only tapas
Family owned, and service is EXCELLENT
GREAT Spanish wine list sangrias
We loved the garlic shrimp and dried Spanish tuna
The dessert was also excellent, a creme brulee flan type of custard
yummy
Fun to try many different delicious bites
Thank you Natalie, we can't wait to come back and visit!
You get a vibe that the owner's number one priority is to please her patrons
Her staff enjoys being a part of the experience too
The owner addressed me by my first name after my second visit The garlic shrimp is a hit and the Sangria ( the bartender on Fridays mixes the drink in three ways)
Look for the specials on the board
the rabbit paella last month was the best
A small place, so it's Ideal for smaller groups or a romantic evening
I went to Las Ramblas with my co-workers on Friday night and I was impressed
The tapas at this bar were better than the ones I had in Barcelona
We ordered 7 tapas for four people and it was plenty
The specials were especially interesting, especially the monk fish with serrano ham - delicious! Owner Natalie was very attentive and made the dining experience a whole lot of fun
The wine was also especially great
The place is small but the tapas are not
We will be back!!!
Was drinking Sangria at another Spanish joint nearby when the Spanish bartender at this well established place recommended Las Ramblas to us as a place for some real deal Spanish tapas
The tapas and manzanilla brought back great memories from my time in Spain
Much like in the tapas bars on the Iberian Pennisula, this place is small and quaint with superior service and knowledge of the food

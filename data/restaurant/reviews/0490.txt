The fish is so fresh and delicious
They have a great Sake selection and they have some great, innovative appetizers
Not just your average Shu-Mai and salads
The simply beautiful decor and excellent service just add to the experience
I can not begin to describe how delectable all of our meals have been, and the best part about itthey are reasonably priced!
I simply LOVE going to Europa lately! I'm always greated politely and even get table visits from the manager just making sure everything is okay
The fact that he's cute is a real bonus! I'm not sure if he's just doing his job, or if he visits our table because we're four young women, but keep it coming Peter!
This old Evergreen Shanghai has been transformed into a new, WONDERFUL restaurant on the upper Eastside
Recently reopened under the name of SHANGHAI PALACE, they now have a remarkable new chef (they say he is a 4-star chef in Shanghai)
Their menu is more upscale than the typical neighborhood Chinese and the dishes taste and feel far more authentic, fresh and delicious
It is definately NOT your hum-drum typical Chinese restaurant experience
Try the shredded turnip cake or juicy pork/crab dumplings dim sum
Do NOT miss their version of Shanghai Wonton and Shanghai Hot Sour Soups!!! Their lobster grand marnier and their lamb shanghai are outstanding
Even their beef lo-mein tasted fresh and delicious
Do NOT expect usual selections like General Tso's Chicken - menu leans toward Shanghai specialities
The staff is courteous and helpful as well
The better food translates into somewhat higher pricing but well worth it
Had a private party upstairs, staff was attentive and sweet, food was delicious as was the wine
A great choice for kosher cuisine!
The food is gevaldic
I schept all over myself once I tasted their green salad
There is nothing else to say is lay down your tephilin and run before chef Chaim Smilovitz leaves
Todd Ebglish has nothing on this guy
Joey Cramarossa's is the one-man band behind this take-out sandwich shop housed in a former broom closet
He makes any sandwich to order for less than $6 piling on more meat, cheese or garnish upon request, at no extra charge
For Cramarossa, huge portions, cheap prices and top-shelf ingredients (bread from Parisi and Pane Antiqua bakeries, fresh fruits and vegetables from Chinatown) are the name of the game
And the jokes come free
great sandwiches and juices, super reasonable prices, check it our
The Scene During the lunch rush, two cooks and one counter guy scramble to put orders together while the phone rings off the hook
Most of those calls are delivery or takeout orders
The restaurant, which moved from a smaller space next door, now seats small groups comfortably, but it's still a mostly takeout affair
The Food Almost every sandwich has a vegetarian counterpart, and often it's as good or better than the meaty original
In fact, the Big Mack Daddy--a veggie burger topped with tofu bacon and all the fixings on a brioche bun--is probably the best veggie burger in the city
Meat eaters should grab a grilled chicken po' boy, all warm and cheesy, or the Spicy Rizzak--turkey, bacon, cheese and spicy mayo on a hefty hero, served hot or cold
Soups are homemade daily and rely heavily on seasonal inspiration
Living in the neighborhood, I'm a big fan of Tiny's - BUT - they are always out of some ingredient!  There have been more than a handful of times where I've ordered a sandwich and I'm told that all they have left is white bread
How can sandwich show be out of bread?? So instead I'll order a salad
Sorry! No lettuce left! Extremely frustrating and a good way to lose customers
Plus the chicks that work there are all obnoxious and rude
The hot chicken sandwiches are to die for, and the staff is very friendly
The place is kid friendly too, you can't go wrong
I can't remember the last time I had a chicken salad that was this good
The food is delicious, priced right, and the service was friendly
I love this place! Best veggie burger in the city
the portions are ample, and the quality is excellent
I've had most of their 25 sandwiches and give them a big thumbs up rating
Certainly not the best sushi in New York, however, it is always fresh, and the place is very clean, sterile
I trust the people at Go Sushi, it never disappoints
Straight-forward, no surprises, very decent Japanese food
I wasn't impressed by the fish-- at all
The live uni tasted funky, if not spoiled, while the rest of the fish were average at best
Moreover, the service was terrible-- we were ignored, snapped at, berated
It was a very strange experience, especially since the place was ALMOST COMPLETELY EMPTY during prime weekday dinner time!!! I suspect the reviewers who are raving about this place have a vested interested-- could they be relatives of the owners, perhaps? The one thing this restaurant does have is a decent sake collection at a reasonable price
Otherwise, I would just skip this place
We pay some of the highest rents in the country, living expenses are off the roof, work long hours, paycheck disapears before we even realize it
The good thing is Manhattan offers so much to enjoy and all is so close to home
Well Tsuki is one of those places that end of the month you are still happy that you live in this tiny island of concrete jungle
I enjoyed my meal throughly
I had a combination of some of the tastiest fresh seafood I have ever tried and I was recommended a small bottle of excellent sake instead of my usual bottle beer
Overall I was taken care of from every angle plus my bill wasn't as bad as I thought after eating pretty much half of the right page menu
I walked in to this tiny restaurant on First avenue one late night after work
I have seen few other Japanese restaurants in the immediate area but Tsuki has something special to offer
Most extensive authentic sake selection in the upper east side along with exotic and fresh sushi
Personally I prefer sashimi and I am very picky about where I eat
All I can say is this tiny family owned establishment exceed my expectations
When I left, I was truly satisfied with the overall experience
I recommend sitting at the Sushi bar and let the chefs, Mike and Johhny do their magic
It's like watching the Iron Chefs on TV
Definitly try the Volcano Roll and the Sushi Pizza
make sure you won't forget to try one of the cold sakes
If you are not sure which one to get, let Mike's wife select one for your taste
Salute!
I have no clue what that other recent negative review is talking about - the food at tsuki is amazing! seriously, one of the best sushi restaurants in nyc (and take it from me, the sushi maven)
The service is always great, and they do warn you that some of their options are very authentic and unlike what you may have previoulsy experienced
I highly recommend it!!
I have walked by this place so many times and have never stopped in
I finally went because I was in search of some quality fresh sushi in this area(hard to find)
This place did not dissapoint
The fish was really fresh and the sushi almost melt in my mouth
I loved it
The only downfall was that: they messed up my take-out order and I paid extra for sushi that was cheaper than what I actually ordered, and they only take amperican express
Otherwise, I cannot wait to go back
My fav sushi place in NYC
Their spicy sauce is great
You must must must get the sushi pizza
Dont worry, there is no cheese
Its a pancake of rice lightly fried with spicy sauce, chunks of tuna and salmon and avacado
Cut into 4 slices
Once you eat it you will become a regular!!!
I always passed by Tsuki on my way home and most of the time didn't even realize there was a Japanese restaurant there
Very easy to miss but once you eat there you'll always know where it is by heart and stomach
I am crazy about sashimi and cold sake, especially if the fish is fresh and tasty, sake is premium and cold
Chef Maeda is very creative with the extra fresh ingredients
I totally leave the food selection up to him after giving few pointers regarding my fish preference
He reinvents the definition of simple traditional dishes with delicious taste! I recommend the Lobster Tail Motoyaki, Dynamite Volcano Rolls, Monster Eel and definitely the inventive Sushi Pizza! Make sure you pair your food with a bottle of cold sake from a large selection of Japanese imports
Enjoy!
sorry if i don't follow the crowd
expectations were real hi reading the '10's'
since i was in the neighborhood, we made sure to give this a try
it's good but, like the movie is never as good as the book, this is same analogy

We were told by some neighbours that this was a great place to take children - what a joke
The only glasses they have are wine glasses, very difficult and dangerous for young kids to drink out of
The kids food was tasteless and over priced
The main menu although a massive choice of dishes, we found to be also fairly tasteless food and certainly not worth the price
Give this one a miss
the service was good, i tried the mix seafood salad, it was very tasty
my friend had some anipasta- eerything was realy fresh and tasty
they have to do somthing on their dessert
I recently moved from the 5th Ave
neighborhood, but still like to eat at Aunt Suzie's when I go back
The fare is relatively standard, but always well made and delicious, with good portions
Bottles of wine are reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is relaxed -- even when it's crowded
Sometimes I wish there were a bar to sit at and have a glass of wine, but on the other hand the lack of one allows the place a pleasant sit down sort of feel
Not too fancy, but fun; every neighborhood needs one
We love this place!!! My husband and I find ourselves here on a weekly basis
Not only does it have the best home cooking in Park Slope at the most affordable prices, but the variety of dishes to choose from will keep you happy forever
Make sure you try the chicken cucinetta it's the greatest!!! The atmosphere is warm and cozy and check out the family photos to try and find the real Aunt Suzie
You'll keep coming back too!!!!
Great for dates, special occasions, big family meals, or just any night you want to go out and get great Italian food
The food is priced to be affordable
The cannolis are amazing
It is worth the wait to get a table
You can't go wrong at Aunt Suzie's
There is a extenzive variety of food on the menu, the prices are unbeatable and the portions are huge
When you eat here you feel like you are sitting in someone's dining room, with the assorted black and white photos on the wall and the mismatched napkins, tables and chairs
The the waitstaff makes you feel like you are a part of the family and is always attentive
And don't forget dessert!
we've had some slow service in the past, but not always
the food is amazing, definitely worth a visit!
This is an average red-sauce joint, nice atmosphere and reasonable prices
It's not the #8 best Italain in NYC though
I wouldn't even put in a top 10 for Park Slope
I don't get the rating
I think someone is stuffing the vote ballot box
My husband and I recently had our 3rd year anniversary and wanted to have a relaxed time at dinner, but still wanted great food
and we found the place! The food was GREAT(very good Italian cooking)! The wine was Great! The dessert's were GREAT! -Such great food and the prices were very reasonable
The atmosphere was perfect
We didn't feel like we were in a NYC restaurant
the hip and trendy bit can get old, there are times you just want to enjoy a nice meal in a cozy place and this fit the bill
We plan on not only spending more dates there, but sharing the experience with our family and friends!
Aunt Suzie's computes in my book
The experience adds up: nice atmosphere, friendly waiters, and down home Italian cooking
A great neighborhood spot where the bill doesn't get you down
Absolutely wonderful and warm
A treat for the whole family
Everyone finds something they like
I really like the fact that they have lots of menu choices
So far all my choices have been delicious
I have been to Aunt Suzie's about 5 times
I just have never thought the food was that great - it's ALMOST there but it's kind of 'low rent,' if you know what I mean
I really like the atmosphere
Their 'cheap menu' consists of $9 items
Not bad
but not exactly 'cheap
' Anyway, I wish I thought it was better but I don't
You know you're in a great neighborhood place when you can enjoy stretchy cheesy chicken parmigian drenched in a delicious tomato sauce and you don't have to pretend your some kind of food expert
My kind of restaurant, and i don't have to worry about the bill
it's totally reasonable
The prices are pretty low, so that's good
But, I found the food to be a bit bland
There is definitely better Italian in Park Slope
Very nice family dining experience
The Veal Vagabond was very good, as were the other dishes on the table (veal piccata, shrimp something-or-other and chicken)
Meal began with a salad, the main course came with a side of pasta and red sauce (next time I'll pay the extra $2
50 to upgrade to one of the more interesting sauces), and ended, in my case, with an enormous chocolate mousse (first time I've ever not finished a chocolate mousse)
And while I prefer my mousses darker (and without cream folded into it), this was clearly homemade and very good
I'm not sure I would recommend bringing a date here for a quiet, intimate dinner, but it's a great spot for a group of friends or family
and that's a good thing
the perfect solution to a long and enjoyable sunday family-style feast
you will leave with both a full stomach and wallet
I love this restaurant! It's a great place to bring kids and the family, yet intimate enough to also bring a date
The food is very good, and the prices cannot be beat
Wonderful chocolate mousse desert is one of my faves!
Without a doubt this is the best old fashion Ilalian restaurant around! It's great food you remember from the past and you don't need an interpreter to order
It's a lot cheaper than most because you don't have to order lots of courses to be satisfied
We all love Aunt Suzie
It is one of the few places where you take the kids and the adults like it too
There's something for everyone
The menu is enormous and the food is excellent
Aunt Suzie's has always been a favorite of mine, even before they moved to Park Slope
Now that I live out of town, I've made it my first stop in Brooklyn every time I come home
And that's a good way to describe it
Eating at Aunt Suzie's is like coming home
The food is great, the surroundings are warm, and the staff is family
What more can you ask for
This is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn
I've never been dissapointed
The portions are Italian sized! The cost is reasonable, to say the least, and the food is the best in town! Lucky for us Italians that we have a place to go when we don't feel like doing it ourselves
Go, eat, enjoy! It does an Italian good!!
I'm Italian, so going to Aunt Suzie's is like going home to my Mom's for Sunday dinner
As a matter of fact, it's the only Italian restaurant around that I'm happy to bring my Mom, and Dad to every chance I get
They deserve it!
Not hip, not happening, not chic and that's why I love it; just great food from my childhood
Refreshingly unpretentious food and atmosphre
Can you imagine, a place in Park Slope where you can still get meatballs and baked ziti
A really great Brooklyn Place
Don't Forget to order the Tortellini with Grandma's meat sauce it's a taste that will bring you back home
The food and portions are just what mama ordered
The lasagna with meat sauce is my personal favorite
This place has been dishing out Italian for decades and was one of the first restaurants on 5th Avenue

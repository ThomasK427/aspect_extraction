If you want to go to a hot, fun, new restaurant that has some flaws (which they seem to be working on), then you will definitely enjoy your experience here as we all did! It's all about expectations! I plan to go back with all my gf's for drinks now! Oh yea, a full dinner (app's, entree, dessert) and drinks (2 or so a person) comes to a little more than $100/head all in
heavy drinkers will get closer to $150/head
Make reservations! Walk-ins can sit at the sushi bar
which had open seats (but your back faces the whole restaurant and all you can see are the sushi chef's and jellyfish tank)
I WENT TO THIS PLACE LAST NIGHT AND NOT EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT BUT GIVE THEM A BREAK
IT'S A 250 SEATS RESTAURANT THAT JUST OPEN 3 WEEKS AGO
MY THOUGHTS: THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT - THE PRICES VERY FAIR CONSIDERING THE DECOR - THE SERVICE IS GOOD NO COMPLAINTS - THE MUSIC IS OK - THE DECOR IS AMAZING (TOO BAD FOR THOSE OFFICE NEON LIGHTS ABOVE THE SKY LIGHTS) - OVERALL THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB, CERTAINLY A BETTER JOB THAN SPICE MARKET AFTER THEIR OPENING
NOW WILL I GO THERE ON A WEEK END WHEN A 1,000 PEOPLE SHOW UP AT THE DOOR
PROBABLY NOT BUT FOR A FUN WEEK DINNER DEFINETELY YES
ANYWAY AND UNFORTUNETELY THE PEOPLE WHO GO ON TO CITYSEARCH ARE THEIR JEALOUS WANT TO BE COMPETITORS WHO LIKE TO TRASH THEM AND THE OTHERS PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO COMPLAIN TO GET FREE DESSERTS
The dining experience was a disaster: Lack of service, too loud to talk, sub par food and attitude by everyone in the place (including the doorman who made us feel uncomfortable showing up for a reservation)
For instance they brought us the wrong drinks (sparkling instead of still) we sent it back but two extra bottles of sparkling water appeared on our tab
We were never often more wine when we finsihed our glasses, we were offered desert menus after our appetizers arrived and my friend recieved a blank desert menu when the appropriate time did arrive
We complained at the time and were given champagne and a couple deserts
When we mentioned other complaints about the bill (ie, several additional items that we never recieved), it was thrown in our face that we accepted the complementary food and should just pay the bill
Awful, awful and awful
Save yourself the stress and stay away - there are many great places to dine in NYC and this is certainly not one of them
I was shocked by how rude and unattentive the service was
We had to ask 3 busboys and wait 25 minutes to find a waiter just to get menus and another 20 to get the wine list
The waiter was very obviously into making $ as the only things he recommended were the most expensive on the menu
They forgot someone's dinner which came 20 minutes after everyone else's and only after flagging down a floor manager to find it
Our bill had an extra $90 worth of food and drinks that we didn't order and still came to $120 a person
To top it all off, the service was completely unapologetic about all their mistakes
You can find a better trained waitstaff at McDonalds
I went to Buddha Bar for a 28th birthday, and was treated like a 15 year old
I was told I could not make a reservation for a party over 8, then we were then seated at a table for 10! Our waiter advised us to let him order for us, he made it seem that he was making it reasonable for us
Well, he decided to give us $200 worth of toro sushi
The waiters response to our compaintwas
well, you agreed to let me order for you, and the manager's was you ate the toro,so tough
Then told us that they can only take 4 cards
house policy! If its house policy you mention that on the phone when a reservation is made for over 4 people! I will never go back and advise you all to stay away
There are SO many other better places to spend your money
I really didn't expect it, the food was awesome!!! I had the shrimp appetizer and the lamb as a main course, and the lamb was absolutely succulent
The DJ (from the Paris Buddha Bar) was incredible
The place just opened, so the service was a little slower than it should be, but not bad for an opening
The decor is out of this world, live Jelly fish, huge Buddha, great skylight and
a smoking lounge, so you don't have to leave the restaurant for a smoke
What else could you ask for??? Can't wait to go back to taste everything else
I know it's just opened, so I wasn't expecting much more than great decor and a scene, but I was really pleasantly surprised
We had a large group, which can sometimes automatically mean crappy service, but our waitress was excellent, very knowledgable, and friendly
The food was great
Really surprisingly good for a see and be seen kind of place
Looking forward to my next visit!
I've been to the best of the best in NYC, but the service here was so bad, I actually decided to take the time to warn others
First they were 40 minutes late seating our party of six (isn't that what the reservation is for?!)
Then it was another 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our table
We literally had to get up and grab two different managers before we got our menus
After demanding a free round of drinks from a third manager, our party decided to bail on this horrific french import
Do yourselves a favor and eat somewhere
anywhere else! Based upon the B/T waiting to get in as we left, this place will be a B/T nightmare within three weeks
Me and my friends had dinner at Buddha Bar last weekend, first we waited 1 hour for our table even though we had a reservation
Then the waiter who took care of our table was really obnoxious
when he was even around
Some of the food came out cold and we had to send it back, by the time it came back most of us were finish with our entrees
The place looks nice, but that's about it
The scene is really not all that
Way overpriced and overrated
NOT RECOMMENDED!!
Besides the ambience, this place was a nightmare
We had a waiter that refused to take down our order - he kept writing down only what he recommended
It took us 5 minutes to order appetizers because he was so pushy (he would recommend an item then write it down even after we said no)
Our appetizers came 15 minutes later, but still no drinks (they finally arrived about 1 minute before our meal)
Although the food was good, it was VERY overpriced (average entree price is about $28, but the portions are small and forgettable)
Over all, the place is pretty and good people watching (although the transparent smoking room is obnoxious - your dinner is spent staring into a room of people smoking) but you can see them from the bar
Save your money and appetite for a good NYC restaurant!
I absolutely loved, loved Buddha Bar
As you enter through a cave like walkway, you feel as if your being transported straight into a different world but with a hint of of the Asian sub-continent following you everywhere
Was there this Saturday and the whole place was hot with models and good looking people
Ambiance and music vibe was off the hook
As the night went on, the music pumped up from the buddha bar selections to a more up-beat house which made us all stand up and move with the beat
And there is a smoke room smack dap in the middle made of glass so everyone can see you and vice versa
Very international, people from all over the world
Absolutely hot!!!
Delightful place enjoyable for small groups, local and fun, very cute
I was told to go there and i went and cant stop talking about it
This place is great the staff is great and friendly
I went to Dave and Buster's with a friend last Friday and we enjoyed ourselves
The place didn't start getting crowded until about 6pm
Our bartender Brian hooked our drinks up and the appetizers were scrumptous
Joseph was another guy that worked with the staff and very pleasant
Happy hours is a must 4-7, u can't beat it
We didn't get to play any games but maybe next time
A mini, overpriced Casino
When you buy the card to play the games they charge 3 bucks for a lousy piece of plastic
I went to spend 5 bucks with my kid and only wound up having 2
Cheap, cheap and I will never be back
Plus the video games are way overpriced
Finally, a DB in the city
I went this past weekend with a group and had a great experience
We were seated promptly, no wait
They did stop and ask for I
D
So if you look young be prepared to be stopped
The service was great well worth leaving a large tip
Tables are not on top of each other good amount of space
Decor is okay - Keep in mind this is a tourist location
Food was good not great but I have nothing to complain about
I've been here about 5-6 times and didn't have to pay a cover charge
The first time I went, I just wanted to check out the layout and didn't have to pay a thing
Since I work right down the block my co-workers and I go for lunch and it usually isn't crowded around then but after-work there were a lot more kids

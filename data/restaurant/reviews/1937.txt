Oh, always make reservation for dinner, (average wait is 30-45mins for walk in)
I ate here during Restaurant Week and the food was excellent as was the service
We're from Chicago and were lucky to get seated immediately without a reservation during lunch
Would go back, the cod was out of this world, salad was yummy, sushi was fresh
this place has gone down hill
(the one in vegas is so bad, that they should pay you to eat their freshly caught desert sandy fish
) parnisky hated it also and he loves funky places
what a waste of time with a stomache ache from bad fish!!!
The best meal of my life -- every dish blew me away
The service was attentive and helpful, but never pretentious
I had the $100 omakase, and it was worth every penny, exceeding my high expectations
My favorites were the sweet and buttery miso black cod and the delicate lobster tempura
What a great experience
As soon as you taste the Rock Shrimp, a big dumb grin will come to your face that you won't get rid of for the rest of the night
It's simply the best! Everything you get here is great
The sushi itself seems to be the weakest link as it wasn't particularly better than other good, much cheaper places I've eaten at, but everything else here is second to none
Get one of the tasting menus if it's your first time there and be sure to ask the waiters for their advice, as they're very knowledgable and helpful
Oh yeah, and bring your credit cards, it's gonna be pricey!
Hibatchiboy likes this place very much
A lot of times people from this place clog the neighborhood - standing around like they own the joint and wanting to be seen
The food is excellent here - don't miss the green tea ice-cream bento box for desert
An amazing experience for all your senses
Excellent service
Classic atmosphere
From the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno to the Soft Shell Crab roll gives a dance to the taste buds
Leave room for dessert and savor over the Bento Box chocolate cake and Yuzu roll with citrus dipping sauce
Thanks for a memorable evening LD
the first time you eat at Nobu is a revelation: the mix of flavors, textures and the impossibly fresh fish
repeated visits reveal that there are only so many sauces and ingredients in the repitiore (yuzu, my old friend) but that doesn't mean it's not good
you'd be a fool to go and just get sushi; the omakase menu is the way to go, giving you a taste of the raw and cooked marvels here
if the busy signal is deterring you, go at lunch when you can pretty much walk in and get seated (and when the omakase is a relative bargain)
The Scene You may not recognize him with his clothes on but, yes, that probably is Harvey Keitel at the next table
Bubby's offers just the kind of clean, healthful cooking that should appeal to the method actor looking to shed a few pounds before his next skinflick
A snack canteen for nearby Miramax-ers during the week, it's overrun by uptowners at weekend brunchtime
The Food The cuisine has the same kind of stylish, determinedly casual feel as the decor
You can stick to the tasty sandwiches or order up more substantial fare (some think the pies alone make Bubby's worth the trip)
There's also a spacious barroom and some nice corner alcove seats
The shiny brass bar adds a touch of class, and the staff mixes an excellent cocktail
There are even seats outside for warmer weather
Go for brunch, the pancakes were great, but my favorite is the huevos rancheros
Try the huevos rancheros, they rock!
We headed over to Bubby's on Mother's Day for a very late breakfast
My husband ordered the original pancakes
He got mildly burned, heavy pancakes, which were mediocre at best
My son, who was in a lunch mood, ordered the garlic burger
It was ok, but nothing more
No irresistable garlic flavor, just an average burger with garlic in it
My order, the asparagus goat cheese omelet, was the biggest flop
It was bland, bland, bland
No salt, no pepper, no spices, no flavor, and the goat cheese tasted more like ricotta
Needless to say it was a disappointment
The biggest slap in the face was that it was an expensive disappointment
Each of our orders averaged about $15 a plate
More than we've ever paid for pancakes, even in the city
I don't mind paying high prices for good food, but this was not even close
I live in Tribeca and eat frequently at Bubby's
If I'm feeling indulgent, I like to tuck into their magnificent plump ribs, followed by a Lemon Meringue Pie and washed down with a milkshake
A hearty two thumbs up
We waited for 45 mins for our weaitress to bring our drinks
She forgot about taking our order and then the people next to us received their meals before we had ordered and we had been sitting there at least an hr longer
The waitress had no idea and when i finally received my meal, it was cold
The worst service I have had in years
The other table didnt even wait for their check because she took so long, so they left!
highly overpriced post-coital eggs
Are now ridiculously overpriced post-coital eggs
Don't let them get away with it!
Yes, the decor is adorable- you will feel like you stopped at a charming bed and breakfast while driving through the countryside
You will be surrounded by distressed wooden antiques, aged glass bottles and black and white pictures of somebodys long dead relatives
But when the bill arrives and you realize you just paid $14 for two eggs, hash browns and some toast you will really wonder if it is worth it
The food is typical diner food set at astronomical prices
Two plain pancakes are about $10
I don't remember if the butter was extra
The restuarant is packed to capacity with tables so you have to be mindful of bumping elbows with your neighbors as well
I usaly dont give a bad review but after last night it is a must
If your focus has changed from people who liked your bbq and pie that have kids to mothers and crayon toteing 3 yrs
olds who need a Salad and a happy meal you should have warned me before I sat down
I have been coming for yrs

Please dont ever try to pass off pork that was cooked at a high temp for a shorter time as bbq again
A charred out side and a fatty fat fat inside shows it was just that
It might float with the tikes who dont know better but for your customers who used to come in once or twice a month it just doesnt float
It wasnt a total wash you still have the best potato chips in town
Loud, overpriced, slow - average food - nothing spectacular
I wouldn't return -- they do have good pie, but only when haven't run out
Bubbys has the very best biscuits and jam, all home made I am told
The menu is great and is the only place that I have eaten where the food is as good as I can cook at home
Bubbys feels like home!
I Just do not understand the lemmings that try to crush into this place for a very mediocre brunch
This place is only good for B-list celeb spotting and for people with not taste buds and being deafened by screaming kids
The food is way overpriced and just not that good(apart from the amazing matzoh ball soup)
I came here to Bubby's for the first time yesterday because of a friend's glowing review
I had a great time and a great meal but found that the prices on everything were a few dollars more than most other well known brunch spots
Besides that, everything was great
Try the frittata
Stay away from the $5 hot chocolate
The wait is long but we got in quicker than anticipated
I truly don't understand why people go to this place
In my recent brunch the waiter was rude about getting the order wrong, the omelette was bland (no salt), the home fries were extremely greasy, and the place is ugly
I'd put the food on par with a basic New Jersey diner, no better
Food is good, staff is friendly but speed of service is too painful except for drink cocktails at the bar

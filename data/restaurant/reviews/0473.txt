Appetizers arrived promptly and met standards
The entree's were another matter
For the price and expectation, they were just ok
My date had the yellowfin, I had the Szechaun filet
The yellowfin was fine, just not spectacular
The filet was requested at medium and was a touch too sanguineous for my taste--but I forged ahead
There was a also a soupcon of an ingredient that just did not seem like it belonged in the dish
The wine list was significant, yet a tad overpriced
By the by, value would be the major concern here
My experienced dinner date thought that the food was an after thought to the scene
Made a reservation here last minute on a Wednesday night with no problem
Seated right away, friendly host and waiter and chicken entree and my friend's bass were both perfectly cooked and the sauces were delightful
Downside to this place is that the tables in the middle of the restaurant (where we were seated) were too close together and it can feel a bit invasive at times
Also, the restaurant is quite small so the noise level can get a bit loud
Would definitely go back for the food
Very nice
Very swank
My kind of place
Waitresses were awesome
Bartenders were hot
Nice decor
Good drinks
We waited an hour for a table even though we had a reservation; the maitre'd was snotty; the waiter was incompetent
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!
I went to Butter on a Saturday night, party of eight, many out of towners, and we all had a wonderful time
Two levels of the restaurant appeal to two different moods
Upstairs is more for the serious diner with a calm ambience and downstairs is more of a scene, dimly lit, and more upbeat
If you have friends that you want to impress take them here
I highly recommend the snapper, sea scallops, and the peppered filet mignon
Make sure to show up on time for the reservation because they have many people to please
Great food and knowledgeable staff! And the kahlua bread pudding is to die for
The host was annoyingly condescending
I have a stressful job
The last thing I need is a host to give me attitude
Our waiter was completely MIA most of the night
After ordering a bottle of Dom Perignon I got up to use the facilities
Upon my return my glass of champagne and my napkin were missing
I kindly asked him to replace them
10 minutes later he wasstill MIA
My belief is that if a bottle of champagne is going to cost me $500 after service charges, I believe it should poured for me and I should actually have a glass to drink it from
If you are looking to try something new and have people actually tell you the specials, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! If you are looking to be treated rudely and get average food, by all means
Great food despite all the hipsters who look more like extras from TRL Live bouncing around the joint
-- Seriously, I was very impressed with the food all five times I've been there and I've been everywhere in the city
Clearly the chef has talent, but the front of the house is run like a wanna-be version of Bungalow 8
Or a low rent Bungalow 8 I should say
The result is that you might have to wait outside or in the lobby just to convince the door person that you in fact are there to give them your money for dinner
I have visited Butter several times and with each time it gets better and better
The food, despite the editoral listed, is as exquisite as the atmosphere
I feel comfortable and welcomed at this new hot spot
I only wish more people didn't know it existed!
Have been to Butter a few times and my opinion changes every time I visit
The best experience I have had was when I went with a large group of girlfriends and sat upstairs
I like the upper level better since it is smoke free and just nicer altogether
Good food though a limited menu
The skate is a wonderful dish and would reccomend to amy diners who have yet to visit
Downstairs is cool too since you can smoke at your table (which I do) However it gets very very smoky which isn't really pleasurable while eating and since it has become a hot spot to hang out at, It's a bit over crowded lately
Liked it better before anyone knew about it
Went to Butter the other night after it was recommended by two friends and had a great time
We had reservations and were seated promptly--which is unusual in NYC
The staff was very nice and liked how we got the complimentary wine samle along with an h'orduerve
Great atmosphere as well--downstairs is a little loud, so do not recommed eating down there
I will defintely go back!
The service was really crappy - so we left a small tip
little did I know, a few weeks later after receiving my credit card bill I noticed the waiter has written in an extra digit to the tip
This is an outright fraud on top of the fact that the service has been very bad and the food mediocre for the money
Despite many unassuring reviews, I had a fabulous time at Butter
The food was excellent, the waitstaff was attentive and the service was quick
However, the appetizers were more tempting than the entrees
Definitely try the gnocchi with truffle sauce and the portabello salad
The wine list was extensive
The diners were mixed, but the bar goers were definitely dressed to impress
After dinner, it was only a short walk downstairs to the swanky, more dimly lit lounge
Altogether a very fine dining experience
The room is eyecatching - cylindrical, long, and paneled in cedar with a view of a forest at the far end
soft lighting and comfortable seating
The food although a little pricey is outstanding across the board - salads, the lamb, the bananas foster dessert - all superb
The space was quite beautiful
Feeling of being in a forest
Friendly service and good food
Great for impressing and looking fabulous
I will never understand why a staff finds it necessary to portray a haughty attitude when the substance of the venue (food, service, wine list, hostesses) are mediocre, unprofessional and bland
Our hostess was more concerned about the appearance of the banquets than wether we had the right menus
The wait staff has little knowlege of what is coming out of the kitchen except you need to eat quickly to make room for the club crowd expected later
It is too expensive for all this
They should be trying to entice customers back not act as though they are lucky to be there- this place will soon meet the same ending as its predessesor Belgo
I had 17 friends meet me at Butter last night to celebrate my birthday
Despite our reservation (which was made weeks in advance and confirmed that day), we were all made to wait at the bar for over an hour because of a last minute private party
Aside from our annoyance at the lack of seating, the drinks were thimble-sized and overpriced, and the staff was rude and unaccomodating
I actually had to MOVE my entire birthday party down the street to Pravda, which accomodated us all on a moment's notice and saved my birthday
Do not recommend this spot for ANY special occasion!
While the decor and atmosphere was really cool, and good for people watching, one would expect better food for this price level
Not that it was *bad* per-se, but rather unimpressive
The scallops appetizer was interesting and tasty, but they serve *two* scallops! I had the duck, which was slightly bland and uneventful; my fiance had the sauted skate, which was a better choice
Despite the negative reviews on this site, the service from the Maitre d', bartender, and our waitress was not a problem at all
In summary Butter is acceptable, not exceptional, and for this price range I expect to be impressed
Have been twice and both times decent food, cool physical space has been massively overshadowed by a lame crowd and some even lamer service
Perfect spot if you are looking to log some time w/ a crowd of pretentious wannabe Hampton socialites coupled w/ a healthy dose of Bridge and Tunnel tradgedies
After reading the reviews for Butter, I had some reservation about trying it myself, but man was I surprised
It was awesome
Sure it reeks of Hamptons aristocracy, but that is why it is a 'beautiful people' place

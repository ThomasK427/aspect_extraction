I also came on St
Patrick's Day wanting corn beef and cabbage and boy did they deliver
I frequent this place often and everything I order is delicious
You can't go wrong, everything on the menu is worth eating--I always know I can rely on Michael's for a good meal
Brunch is wonderful
If you're staying at the Sheraton Towers or nearby, definitely check out the club sandwhich
While a club is always a safe bet I was pleasantly surprised at how truly good (and huge) the club is at Streeters
The menu is pretty good for the typical in-hotel establishment
Large windows with lots of window-seating for people watching
The Scene Hot weather brings crowds to Cones, the popular ice cream parlor opened in 1988 by two brothers from Argentina
Families wander in from sweaty strolls down Bleecker Street, oohing and ahhing at flavors or the large images of cherry-topped sundaes and ice cream cakes on the walls
Behind the counter, friendly staff offer tastes in minimum batches of two
The Food Cones doesn't hard-freeze its ice cream, a fact that's responsible in part for the taffy-like, almost elastic consistency of rich flavors like black cherry, coffee mocha chocolate chip, almond cream or tiramisu
Sorbets are exceptional--watermelon, for example, has an icy, loosely packed texture and a piercing jolt of sugary watermelon flavor
Close your eyes and there's no purer expression of summer
My best friend and I tried four different flavors at Cones the other night
Everything tasted the same, just like sugar
What a waste of time and money! I had heard that the owners of Cones, the DAloisio brothers, brought the technique of made-from-scratch ice cream and sorbets from their native Buenos Aires
I had also heard that they trained with a master gelato maker in Buenos Aires for four months, before bringing their product to New York
I've been to Argentina on many occasions and they certainly know their ice cream and gelato down there
In Argentina, where the population is largely Italian, the taste for ice cream is similar to that from Italy
Therefore, people in Buenos Aires take their ice cream very seriously
Argentinean ice cream is some of the best in the world! These Argentinos need to return home for more lessons on how to make this product properly
I probably will never return to Cones, unless I'm just passing by and decide to try a FREE SAMPLE of their zabaglione / sambayn flavor
I've heard it's good
But, then again, I heard Cones has great ice cream
I guess those people Only Want the Taste of Sugar!
So I walked in here as I was going down Bleecker with a friend, and I wasn't going to order anything but my friend wanted gelato
but since we were in, I figured I'd try some anyway, since gelato is one of my favorite things EVER
So I tried the tiramisu and I swear, I almost cried
It was absolutely AMAZING and had truly captured every essence of good old-fashioned tiramisu
And then I tried the hazlenut which was totally great too
So then I ended up getting both because they were just obscenely wonderful
DEFINITELY worth going to!!!
for selection, and quality cones is the best, plus the location is great, only three blocks from my house, I love the sorbets dairy free, and they carry like a dozen
without a doubt, that guy that wrote about the green tea flavor doesn't know that in most of south american mate is prepared mostly sugarless
and you call yourself a fan of green tea?
This place gets pretty busy on summer nights and for good reason
Their gelato is creamy and tasty
although a bit more expensive than your typical ben and jerrys
However, service could be given with a smile by the older gentleman
Try it if you like icecream! The tiramasu and almond icecream are great
You won't remember that a Sorbet has no milk or fat of any kind when you have a taste of any flavor of sorbet at Cones
They use real fruit, not condensed juices- the rasberry is particularly yummy
The Gelato is dense and tasty too
It is pricey, but remember that gelato has almost no air, while ice cream is loaded with it, so you are actually getting more taste per scoop than you would with ice cream
Just a small scoop is very filling
Ice cream is ok, but not really that great
Also a relatively small selection of flavors
Not sure what all the hype is about
I am a real green tea fan and I was really excited to see that there was Brazilian Green tea
I was soon disappointed when I tasted it and it was bitter when I was expected something sweet and creamy
My friend got tiramisu and it tasted like vanilla fudge which was really weird
The place is really trendy but the portions are really small
Your paying for the decor but not the product
My boyfriend and I am in LOVE with Cones
Our favorites are the Pistachio, Chocolate Chip and Tiramisu
Cones is the perfect place to finish off a lunch or dinner
Have great pizza at John's just 2 doors away and get a scoop of Almond Cream and Coconut (my favorite) to top it off
Melts in your mouth like nothing other!!!! Delicious!!!!
Cones is the best gelato I have had
And I have been to Italy
Highly recommended
My favorite - Dulce flavor
Usually have several scoops
Probably the best ice cream I've ever had
in NYC or elsewhere
Was very creamy, but still relatively light
I am a true gelato/ice cream lover, believe me I tried every single flavor of BJs, Hagen Daaz, Starbucks, Edys, Coldstone, Serendipitys and so on
And no other places beats Cones! I am so glad that I live in NYC
I esp loooove their Tiramisu gelato
I 3 Cones!!
Honestly I don't think its possible to make Ice Cream better than this
Best service and cool (literally) owners
We bought a portable cooler/freezer that plugs into the cigarette lighter just so we could bring this ice cream and sorbet home
It is the absolute best! Expensive, but worth it
The service is friendly and attentive
The owners are warm and care about their product and their customers
Cones' gelatos and sorbettos are simply the best I have had on four continents
The flavors are imaginative - taking full advantage of the changing seasons - deep and satisfying, and the sorbettos full of wonderfully ripe fruit
The Grapefruit is so expressive of Florida citrus that were you to close your eyes you would be surprised to find your mouth not filled with pulp, and not to be spitting out seeds
Worth the trip from any location
I think this is just another one of those over rated place that is actually just average
well
if you consider $5 for 2flavors of gelato, it's actually below average
sorbets and gelatos has ok flavor but too sweet
I went there several times to try different flavors, but still was not what I expected
After viewing all the good reviews, I was expecting to have the quality of gelato you get in Italy, but I was quite disapointed
Get the hazelnut! Go ahead and get any flavor for that matter
What can you say about ice cream? It was the best ice cream I have ever tasted that's for sure
It's virtually impossible to make a bad choice at Cones
Any of the sorbets are great
The Watermelon sorbet is soooo good
Also, the Almond Cream is magnificent
But go often to try them all
And get it in a sugar cone or waffle cone!
Ever since I discovered Cones a few years ago, I've been known to take a trip to the city just to have some of their HELADO
Their chocolate mousse, banana, FRUTILLA AL AGUA (strawberry sorbet), and dulce de leche are out of this world!!!
Their ice cream is as good as the one from best rated heladeria in Argentina called FREDDO
You certainly get what you pay for

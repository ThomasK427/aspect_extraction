as beautifully presented as it is delicious
the waiters are extremely friendly and helpful
A gift to the upper east side
check it out, totally different than every other generic sushi joint
try the wasabi tuna dumplings - magical!
From all of Haru, they are the best
Excellent design, nice bartender, nice atmosphere
The service ?, really different with 4 other Haru
I don't really know what they are doing ?
This place is supposed to be same quality with the other one, but it is not
It is really upscale, really great quality than their group
I was ok with the other Haru, but this place make me feel different, I feel not in Haru anymore
My friend is a VIP at this terrible restaurnt, when I came in from out of town he insitead in having dinner there
The apps
came with are main course after waiting for one hour, they apoligze to us but that was it, so the main course was cold
We ordered from the restaurnt next door, who's ever heard of that and they could not time the food (do not do thing you cant m anage) our bill was $600 for 5 people with no discount after are terrible experince and my frioend goes there all the time
Lack of respect and terrible service
Never will be seen there again
p
s
sorry for the spilling errors, I dunt have spillcheck
I had the best time on Thursday night, I will recomened to have RSVP
because the place is packed
The food and service is great like at all Haru's but this also has the best music in NYC and the ambience is great, all my friend meet there before going out
Try it you won't regret it !!!!!!!
I live on 73rd street one block from the restaurant and my order took over an hour and half to arrive
When I received it, I was charged $23 for a HALF of a regular pie (gluten free) that was the portion size for one person at best
I called the restaurant explaining that the pie was not priced this way on the menu and was told that new menus with the pricing would be printed soon?? I told them that this was unacceptable and that I was unwilling to pay
The owner then proceeded to tell me that their pricing was competitive with other pizzerias in the area
To take it one step further she then ridiculed me for not thinking that this was reasonable
As an fyi I have lived in the area for 4 years and have literally eaten at every pizza place around and have never seen pricing like this
I hung up the phone and reluctantly paid for the HALF pie because I was starving given the hour and a half wait
When I picked up the slices they were cold and literally crumbled- basically disintegrated
I called the restaurant asking for my money back and was told that the owner was in the process of reprimanding some of the staff and that she would call me back
I called again
still have never had a return call
I took the HALF pie and threw it down the chute and cooked myself some pasta
What a joke
This pizza is so delicious! I love the fresh, healthy ingredients
I have eaten in-restuarant a few times, and ordered delivery for the first time recently
I was a little nervous about delivery (past experience with pizza delivery is that it is never as good at home - i
e
: crust can get soggy)
However, I was so pleased with the pizza that was delivered - it was hot and the crust was very crisp and delicious
I love this place!!
Only went here once, I'm an expert on their menu/food because I spent 10 minutes as the only person in line and all I had to do was read the menu over and over again and watch the guy make pizza
I waited another 8 minutes for the slice
Its like they took the whole anti-pizza thing too far by not having one of the most important draws of a traditional pizza joint: a quick bite
25 minutes for one slice? I'll take my chances with processed ingredients
Spring special with honey whole wheat crust with hummus tomatos and onions was almost good enough to make up for the frustration of waiting
Order a pie ahead of time, it IS worth the price
Unless you're not in a hurry, then sit down and watch the excitement fade from peoples' hungry faces as they realize they're in for the long haul
Their pizza is incredible! I loved every bite! I love that the slices are cut-up into pieces so my friends can try it out! I think the prices are completely reasonable for how it tastes, how it's presented and how it makes me feel afterwards! Not guilty but healthy and energized! I think everyone will love it and I wish they opened in my building because I would be there every day! I am a HUGE fan!!
I stopped into Slice today to grab some lunch
I had read good things about this place, so I thought I would give it a try
Now, I'm not a vegetarian, so perhaps this place will fill in that pizza-eating-vegan niche, but otherwise I was less than impressed
The pizza reminded me of frozen pizza bought in the supermarket
The only difference is that nowadays, you can get better pizza than this in the grocery store
I guess I'll be sticking to my local pizza guys from now on
Oh, and it's expensive
This is a great place if you're looking to indulge in some pizza and not feel guilty afterwards
The whole pies are a little pricy, but worth it because you know you're getting the best ingredients
Seating area is small but very clean and cute
The whole wheat crust is crunchy and delicious
My boyfriend had the chicken pizza slice and could have eaten an entire pie's worth
Definitely check this place out!
I just viewed this restaurant on Recipe For Success on the Food Network
I was just gitty over this great idea
I have been a vegetarian for over 10 years, I do eat cheese but when a person is on a diet it is so hard to enjoy PIZZA
I will be going here ASAP
I just had to rave about it
Don't worry I will review again once I have tasted it! My mouth is already watering
Just ate at Slice last night
My boyfriend found it online and since, being a vegan, I have not eaten NYC pizza he thought he would surprise me
I have to admit I enjoyed eating pizza
And it felt great to eat the same pie as my omnivore guy did
I would recommend the wheat or herb crust- the spelt was a little too crunchy
Get extra cheese to get the true feel of pizza
It is a little expensive for my taste but I will be back
The trip is worth it!! Enjoy
I ventured into this place as a single gal wondering around the upper west side; the menu looked promising and the atmosphere seemed inviting
I was not impressed by the bartender, who greeted me with What can I get you? No Hello, how are you? or Good evening, how are you this evening?
As a waitress in New York, I understand how severs get tired of asking people how they are doing when you so rarely get any acknowlegdment
But, still
a little effort would have been nice, considering this is an upscale establishment
The main course was good
My warm goat cheese salad was not good
The cheese was great but spread on stale (?) bagette
not really enjoying that
The salad was too heavily dressed with an overwhelming amount of balsamic
My skirt steak, however was perfectly cooked and the wilted greens and onions were very satisfying
The bartender did recommed a great glass of wine with my steak, a well balanced Nebbiolo
All in all, salad sucked, bartender was simi-attentive, steak was good
But one thing
it was totally silent! No music
at all
That was creepy, you could hear everyone's conversations
weird
Also, the decor was very minimal
boring in fact

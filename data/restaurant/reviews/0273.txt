My fave is the artichoke ravioli, and I'm sure I'd enjoy more of the entrees but I can't help but order that one over and over again
I also agree with others here that it's a quiet, intimate space that's inappropriate for loud large groups
And though the service was fine, I too find the wait staff detached in some way
Which affects the overall experience
We had high expectations but, aside from enjoying the pleasing decor, our experience was only satisfactory
Service was at best distracted, at worst disdainful, even though we came early with a reservation and are not food novices
The food is well-prepared, but the prices are too high for a small neighborhood restaurant
Prices might not have bothered us if we had been treated more warmly and graciously, but the welcome was nonexistent
We won't return
Buried amidst better known eateries in Park Slope, this is a wonderful place for a date or intimate evening with a friend
There is a romantic outdoor garden, complete with small fountain and covered with vines
The food ranged from good to the very good: we had a plate of seafood tapas which were delicious but not enough for 4 as some claim--try for 2
I had the rabbit, which was very good, as were the potatoes that came with it
There is an extensive wine list, I'd stick with the large variety of Portuguese bottles
Deserts were also good, though limited
The place was still slightly more expensive than I expected; but, in truth, considering the professional service by an authentic Mediterranean staff, it's worth the experience
The American Express-only policy that led to an unwanted grocery ATM trip was annoying
This place is so adorable, you definitely do not think you are in New York
There arent many choices (vegetarians beware!), but what they do have is done right
I never thought Id try quail, and it was so wonderful - tender and tasty
And, the cappuccino, oh, the cappuccino, was straight from Italy - do NOT leave without trying it
it will blow your mind!
This was the best overall meal I've had in NY in a long time
My wife and I are terrible foodies, and thought everything was superb at Convivum Osteria
I had the pine nut crusted lamb - which was the best lamb I've had and the flourless chocolate cake which was delicious
HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend
Call ahead for reservations though
I have been to Convivum about 5-8 times in the last two years and I absolutely love it
What really makes the restaurant are the owners
They are very warm and lovely
The good is also excellent
Very accomodating

From making the reservation (not required) to the before dinner drink (cava), to the table (romantic), to the the ambiance (candles, spanish antiques, etc) to the food of course (original, incredibly deep and rich in flavor) to our departure and saying goodnight to the waiter
this restaurant was a perfectly unique, mellow and enjoyable experience
The absolute only downside is that it is not priced as cheaply as most other Park Slope restaurants, but that is because the food is nothing like most Park Slope restaurants
It is worth every cent
After one visit it has become my favorite Brooklyn spot
No need to go to NYC for that special birthday dinner
Congratulations to the owners, designers, chefs, and staff on a restaurant well created
This, lovely, antiquated restaurant is THE place to go for romantic evenings a subdued atmosphere
The person before me is right, this is NOT a birthday place where nosiy, boisterous people are welcomed
A fine restaurant expects fine behavior
Rude behavior is expected when people act distruptive themselves
If I had more money, I would come here once a week! The food is DIVINE and worth every penny! Definately make reservations in advance for special occasions/holidays
My husband I actually prefer the lower level which is in the wine celler
Very romantic it makes you feel as though you're in old Europe
When my family visits us in Brooklyn from the Amalfi Coast I take them from the airport to Convivium
There is no other resturant that can advocate my position that New York can offer the warmth and nourishment of home
When my husband and I want to celebrate an anniversary or simply want to be together, we go directly to Convivium Osteria
The exquisite attention to detail in the food and decor have set the scene for some of the more remarkable evenings we have shared
On my first visit, the out-of-this-world olives and bread were almost enough to convince me that this resturant spoke my language, the fish, lamb, pastas and sweets keep me coming back
Convivium is so remarkable because it is guided by the intellegence and love of its proprietors who make every guest feel welcomed, every time
It's that good
This has been my favorite restaurant since I first discovered it about 2 years ago
It's like something out of the Italian countryside transported into brooklyn
the food is absolutely incredible, the owners (a couple who live upstairs and I think own the building) are fantastic, and the look of the place
just perfect
Check out the downstairs seating area if you can
Was part of a big group dinner this weekend and had a lovely time
Food was wonderful, inventive, and portions were large
The seafood tapas and cured meat and cheese apps are recommended for two but would easily please 3 or 4 people
The setting is warm, rustic and romantic
The service did not pressure us (and we were there for a while), and provided lots of welcome attention
Plus - they do take American Express
My husband and I dined at Convivium last night after reading all the positive reviews posted here
Our entire experience was wonderful
We loved everything about the place -- the atmosphere (so charming!), service (impeccable), the food (creative delicious)
This has become one of our favorite restaurants in Brooklyn and we've already made plans to come back
I thought that Convivium Osteria was a very nice place, the decor is simply amazing - you think that you are in some European castle
The waiters were also very polite
My favorite dishes were the artichoke appetizer, and of course the spanish version of creme brulee
You have to make sure to make reservations, because it's not a big restarant
Convivium is a great find in Park Slope! Michelle, her husband and the staff are wonderful, warm and inviting! The place has a great rustic charm, whether you're seated in upstairs, in the cellar (it's great) or in the garden (during the summer
shoot for the garden)! The menu changes a bit every so often with new and tasty stuff with a set of standards that are great! I recommend Convivium to anyone interested in good food, good wine and great atmosphere!
The place is fantastic; wonderful food, excellent service and charming atmosphere
My favorite place in Park Slope, and the management could not be nicer
Michelle put together an affordable dinner party in the cellar for 15; we had to cancel with only a few days notice, and she was completely understanding and gave us no hassles
Convivium is Manhattan excellence without the Manhattan attitude
Reservations for 4 on Christmas Eve and our experience couldn't have been better
Our server was nothing if not professional and the cellerseating felt like Venice
(Try to get seated in the cellar) There is a quail and fig appetizer that was superb, the artichoke appetizer was great as well, but you could easily get the same results at home
If they have it, get the duck tortelle - oh my god!! For dessert, I recommend the fig and chocolate cake
I got pannecotta with blueberry sauce and while it was very clean tasting (like drinking milk, really) it wasn't anything special
This was my first time at Convivium and my expectations were very high and, ultimately, fulfilled
One note, Convivium is a true European restaurant in the sense that portions are just enough that you really enjoy the chef's art - not enough to really leave you satiated
This can be one of the best places to escape to in the slope
When they're on, they're really on
When they're off, dashed expectations can leave a bitter aftertaste
Such is love
After several wonderful experiences here and only a few bad ones, here's my advice: 1
Go early in the week
2
Try the garden or wine cellar for atmosphere
3
Consider the specials and save room for pana cotta! 4
Take a wad of cash
They don't take cards
We started as a group of 5 and showed up as 7, they couldn't have been more accomadating to our party increasing
We were offered inside or outside and chose inside for the charming euro-country decor

Our waiter was not only adorable but, very helpful
He kept us amused throughout the night w/o being too obtrusive
I'm not very familiar w/ Thai food, but there seemed to be something on the menu to amuse everyone in our group
The manager even came to talk to us, I felt so important
I'm definetly going back!!
Rain is a great first date place
It's cool but not too trendy, sophisticated but casual, expensive but not too extravagant, and the food is good but not too exotic
The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed
You really can't go wrong here
Rain is consistently good
they have a great bar area where you can enjoy a cocktail while waiting to be seated
It's dark and romantic
yet you can dress casually
The food is yummy
and reasonably priced
I especially love the chips they give you when you're first seated
and the delicious peanut dipping sauce
Definitely better than plain old bread!
Our server didn't take the time to tell us of the additional appetizers and entrees for the evening, we had to ask after overhearing him tell the next table (after we had already ordered appetizers)
The calamari appetizer was very good
The spring rolls were small and unexceptional
The garnish on the plate was more substantial than the rolls themselves
We had been here before and loved it
We probably won't go back again
Pan-Asian food at its best! Rain is impressive from the outside and impressive from the inside
Food, decor, and service are all great
The atmosphere is fairly quiet, romantic and although a little pricey, is well worth the trip
Booking a reservation is highly recommended as the restaurant is always busy
when the concierge at our hotel recommended this thai restaurant, i was thinking it was going to be a fairly priced and authentic thai restuarant
to my disappointment, the food wasn't that genuine! some of the entrees/appetizers were overpriced and the portions weren't that generous! two good things about rain, decor and service!
Been going there for years but it is way too inconsistent in terms of food and service
Food - sometimes great, sometimes weak and average
Service - really weak on busy nights
They seem under staffed and Waiters do not really know the menu
I have had awesome food and service their (don't get me wrong) but lately I would be wary of taking an important guest their or try to impress someone with what used to be a great night out
Waiters are too busy to focus and get half your order wrong
Hosts if they are not Diane are nasty
Give it a shot but make it real casual and plan to spend $100 for 2 people
The Scene This trendy, open-air restaurant on the corner of Union Square Park is always packed with a diverse young crowd of friendly, unpretentious types
The line moves quickly, perhaps because there are no alcoholic drinks, which cuts lingering at the tables to a minimum
The Food Stick with fresh vegetables
Top billing goes to the "harvest delight" salad, which is made up of eggplant, sweet peppers, string beans, carrots and cashews
Also excellent is eggplant in garlic sauce
Most dishes are marinated in light vinaigrettes or mild brown or curry sauces
The "Zen vegi-burger," with sunflower seeds, kale and brown rice is popular, as is the fragrant, filling curry rice noodle soup
The food is light, and so are the portions
First of all, I do not understand how this was given $$$, it is very inexpensive
I have not had a dish here that I did not enjoy, and by no means am I a vegetarian
My favorite dish here is the Curry Supremo, tastes exactly like a great chicken curry
This is a great restuarant, worth a trip even for the non-vegetarians
Three times I have called Zen Palate only to call back after waiting for an hour and speaking with the MANAGER who says they've lost my order
Starved and confused, I ask what happened AGAIN
Last night was the last straw
They have no explanation and really don't care
These people don't deserve the business and I would STRONGLY recommend you look elsewhere for a meal
It's New York City
These places are a dime a dozen and won't survive when they treat their customers like dirt
Even though I am not a vegetarian, I was still pleased with the meal I received here
I had a pasta meal with mushrooms, artichoke hearts and soy nuggets, and it was tasty and filling
Even had enough to take home
Menu is made up of soups, rice, tofu, wheat gluten, soy dishes with varying vegetables
Excellent value too since they have a number of dishes just under 10 dollars
Moves quickly if you want to go out but don't have much time to sit down to dinner
I recently dined at the Broadway location and found the menu to be very interesting
I also liked the simple and cool ambience
I ordered a Tofu dish that came with two spring rolls, rice, and sweet mashed potatoes (which I found to be a little odd in addition to the rice)
However, our server was very friendly and willing to answer our questions about certain items on the menu
My dish was very tasty and I thought that it was a good sized portion at a reasonable price
When I'm in the mood again for vegetarian but interesting food as well, I will most likely go back to Zen Palate
The menu at Zen Palate downstairs is different from the classier upstairs
Downstairs the service is fast and friendly, and each entree is a 2 course meal in itself
Upstairs offer ambience and a more refined menu, offering innovative dishes
The wait staff here (all Chinese), however, also carry a slight attitude
Also, skip desserts here - everything is mushy
Though I am a vegetarian, I do crave meat sometimes and Zen Palate satisfies me everytime
They turn a couple of standard Chinese dishes into vegetarian--like orange chicken and sweet and sour pork
Delicious! Good service too--my water glass is never empty
My husband and I are regulars
I had dinner here for under $20, plus I took some home for lunch the next day
If you're not a pig, this place has very good value
The only problem is deciding what to order
Even before I had tasted the food, I told my dining companion that we have to come back because everything on the menu looks so good
They even have a whole page of dishes focused on mushrooms (for people who like that stuff)
I had the wheat noodles and hot and sour soup, both good, but on the conservative side
If you're with carnivores, don't come here because there is no meat
Though my friend has converted some people to tofu-lovers here
I adore Zen Palate - and the West side location, although smaller than the one on Union Square - is terrific
The dishes are varied and tasty
Thay also offer fresh carrot and/or apple juice
The formal dining area is quieter and also more pricey
The vegan Sugar cane shrimp is delish!  All in all - I really love Zen Palate - and I've been to 2 out of 3
One of my favorite restaurants in New York
I'm not even vegetarian
Every single item on this menu is outrageously delicious
The prices are great too
If you're a first timer, I'd recommend the Sweet and Sour Sensation
Also try the peanut milk shake
Watch out for Moby
This is the best place for vegiterians, very unique food taste, many people come there ofter as regulars
It gives a good value for your money, yiu can eat well for not so much money

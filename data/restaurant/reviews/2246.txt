I thought to myself what a great deal! I had been to Ben Bensons before, and paid full price, this had to be too good to be true, and IT WAS! The promotion was not even available, and I was treated rudely, and I was made to feel like I was sub-human
Maybe it was because the last time I was there, I arrived by limo, that it made a difference, or maybe it had something to do with the fact the that both my boyfriend and I look very young, and the waiter was concerned with getting a big tip! Whatever the case, that type of disrespectful service, from a supposedly top tier restaurant, is inexcusable
It's a lot of meat! Good meat if you're into beef
Not much seafood
Single woman on a holiday Sunday night, treated like I really belonged
Best Cosmopolitan I've had
Delicious fresh crab cocktail, which was recommended by the waiter
Wonderful rib steak, cooked perfectly, but does it have to be big enough for a family of 4?? Thank goodness I didn't order side dishes!!!
Had dinner here with 2 other people; this restaurant has seen better times
Wanted my meat medium well, was told it would have to be medium rare and treated to a lecture by the waiter on why exactly
Someone else ordered the chicken (from the menu) and was told it would unfortunately take an hour and a half to cook since it was a whole chicken, and that he could have a single grilled chicken breast instead
Whatever
The food was good, but not that special, and the waiter was simply annoying
The good reviews must be from their friends
There was nothing I liked about Ben Benson's
Go to SPARKS
Ben Benson's serves up amazing food and they do it quickly
I rolled out of there after one dinner
The crab cakes are probably some of the best I've ever consumed
Their steak was cooked to perfection as were all the trimmings
A perfect pre-theatre restaurant
Highly reccomended!
This was the perfect pre-theater feast, unless you care to be awake for the performance
My sleepiness was well worth the trade off with this fine meal
Salad was fresh, steaks were huge, juicy, and cooked to perfection
Dessert was fabuluous
Next time you crave a steak, this is the only place to go
Always feel at home excellentservice, friendly atmosphere, and outstanding steaks
Ben Bensons is a 10 to New Yorkers
food is superb, ambience perfect, comfy, cozy, safe
A wonderful place
The food is excellent along with the service
I highly recommend this place
As good as the food may be the atmosphere is nonchalant
Alot of tables and eating elbow to elbow with the next table is not exactly ideal for a romantic night
This also slows the service
An ideal place for a night of brilliant food but dare I say again
no privacy
Never had a bad meal
Largest drinks in town take a hungry drunk
I go there several times a year, and it's always a great experience
The waitstaff is friendly, courteous, and not stuck-up
The food always comes as you request it and you're allowed the time to enjoy it and relax
The sauce served with the italian meals is sweet it taste more like dessert
The service is horrible, the owner thinks shes got some 5 star restaurant when its more like 2
If you have to eat there order the milanesas its the only decent thing
The menus are badly translated
The owner only pays attention to you if you have a large group which means money
Otherwise your crap! The waiters are horrible
I've heard such wonderful things about Pluck U and had the pleasure of trying their infamous chicken while having learned a few things: 1) rushed service 2) limited menu 3) semi-reasonable 4) overly popular
The chicken itself was the best part and having tried their infamous boneless wings I realized they're really just lightly breaded chicken nuggets that resemble hush puppies
Like Planet Wings, they have a healthy option on the menu featuring wraps, sandwiches, and even 0-carb wings
Another minus is their delivery (at this location) has been consistently slow as is their horrible phone manners
This will be added to my once-in-a-while places to eat from
In Short The polished-wood street-level bar is jammed with drinkers--don't be surprised to see someone passing a beer over your head to a parched coworker jammed in a corner
Downstairs is an entirely different scene: There's a fireplace with sofas and comfy chairs set around it, and a bar off to the side
It's so relaxing, visitors usually stick around for two (three, four
) post-work drinks
My husband and I went here during our recent trip to NYC
We were very impressed with this place
The ambience was great, good service, and outstanding food
I had a mixed seafood entree which was absolutely delicious
My husband is VERY picky with food - especially when it comes to steak and he praised the steak very highly (and trust me, this doesn't happen often)
Don't be fooled by this place being listed as an Irish Pub - the inside looks very upscale and the service is comparable to other very nice restaurants
If you're in the city and are looking for good food, special occasion celebration, romantic dinner, or just a relaxing place to eat, you should definitely try out this place
Family and I ate at Rosie's for an early dinner (4PM) during our visit to NYC
We were seated promptly though it was a few minutes before we were given menus and water
Ambiance and decor was fun and relaxing
Prices were a little higher than we're used to, the families' steak were good and they were pleased
My seafood combo was nothing to write home about as portions seemed small for the price
It was decent meal to me
Overall, I would recommend Rosie's but would probably be good idea to have a reservation if you dine later in the evening
My wife and I visited this place Mon, Sept 12, 2005
I had a seafood combination plate that was very good
I imagine most of their seafood dishes are pretty good
However, my wife ordered a steak, medium-rare, and there was hardly any pink in it at all
She had to resort to A-1 to flavor it up enough to eat it
The ambiance is very nice, and the service was exceptional (he did offer to make another steak), but we'll try another place for steak the next time we hit the city
We were at Rosie's March 7, 2003
We went out on the town with the idea that we were going to mingle with the in crowd, you know, go to a place where you pay an outrageous cover charge, have to wear all black to fit in, and pay $12 for a watered-down martini, and if you're lucky, have a good time
We stopped in at Rosie's to get a quick bite before we headed out on our journey, and ended up staying the whole night! We hung out downstairs, where the music was great, the people were friendly, drinks were excellent (ask Greg to mix you up a Cherry Lifesaver!)
My wife I will certainly be back the next time we're in town

My parents and I stumbled across this place freezing and starving after visiting Rockefeller Plaza to see the Christmas tree
We were treated to delightful service, but the food is the star here
We each got something different and none of us went wrong
The seafood was incredibly fresh and the preparation was perfect
The shrimp and scallop risotto was one of the best dishes I have ever tasted in any restaurant
Definitely check this place out
With friendly staff, stiff drinks and good food, it's hard to beat in midtown
While it attracts mostly tourists and business types, it's a great meeting place and perfect for groups
On each visit to Rosie O'Grady's I have found this restaurant always has a comforable dining atmosphere
The menu has a good selection to choose from and I was very impressed with the service
It was prompt, couteous and what a delight
Looking forward to my next visit
An upcale Irish pub which offers great food service
Steaks are amazing it's a good choice for large groups
We were pleasantly surprised to find a great restaurant in Times Square
After a show we had surperb steaks and had cocktails at the bar
The bartender was really fun and the crowd was great

Such good service and even better food
What more could you ask for?
The speakeasy setup is so cool
I felt like I was part of old New York
The waiters were chatty and provided great service
T-bone steak was amazing
This is a cool place with great food
I Highly reccomend it
Went here for dinner last week
The food was great, as always
Really you can't get a better steak than Frankie and Johnnie's
THE BEST in town
The steaks at this place were wicked good
My boys and I had a great time--the place is awesome--old school New York style
And the steak was great, of course
The perfect place to eat and hang with your buddies
let met tell you this: I LOVE this place
The steak is just soooo good, and the winelist is extensive
Might I suggest the Porterhouse, with a side of mashed potatoes
I'm a steak and potatoes kind of gal, so this just hit the spot! Just when I thought I would have to unbottom my pants from fullness, out came the dessert menu
Apple Cobbler is the way to go, people! Warm, crisp apples, and an outer shell covered in crumbs is unbelievable
yes, the lights flicker on and off, yes there are old people and tourists on their way to see broadway shows, and the seating is a bit cramped, but the second the food arrived all of that stops mattering
we ordered the lamb chops and the sirloin and both were broiled to perfection
i especially liked how the waiter cut the meat from the bone
my boyfriend and i eat a lot of meat and have been to most of the best places around town and for steak, this one is definitely tops
my mouth is still watering
I dined at Frankie and Johnnie's on Saturday night with a few friends
The service was wonderful, and our waiter was and server were very friendly
The food was delicious-- if you want a good piece of steak, this is the place to go
I had my Porterhouse well-done, and it could not have been any better
It was tender, and just right
For any of you non-steak eaters out there (such as my dining partner), there's plenty else to choose from
The salmon was great, and the mashed potatoes are to die for!!
My husband and I dined here on a recent Friday evening
We were seated promptly
The waitstaff were very polished and you could tell they had all been doing this for a long time
Everything we had was great including lobster and crabmeat cocktail, caesar salad and an excellent surf and turf
The steak had a marvelous seasoning on it and the lobster melted in your mouth
We were amazed that the prices were better that in our favorite steakhouse in Columbus Ohio
I really looked forward to going here after reading mostly positive reviews
The hostess was very nice and helpful
The atmosphere was kind of dingy and they must not have paid there electric bill because the lights kept dimming every 60 seconds, but the reason I went there was for the steak, and it was excellent, the creamed spinach was OK
Went there on a friday evening after work and the place filled up with old people
we were imediatly seated to the left
the food was ok, but i was expecting better
the service was good, you can tell those guys were pros
but overall, i will not be heading back
My dinner at Frankie JOhnnie's was great
The T-bone weas awesome, the steak sauce was superb and our waiter was very helpful when we couldn't decide what to get
Excellent food: I was visiting my sister and broither-in-law in NYC last week and we ate here and the food was delicious
The service was great and we had lots of food leftover to bring home
I went to Frankie Johnnie's after work with some friends and we had a great dinner
I'm not a steak lover but the non-steak choices on the menu were quality
I wound up having the Chilean Sea Bass which was really good and the waiter's wine recommendation was excellent
Definitely would visit again
I had the best steak I've ever tasted at Frankie Johnnie's
I was sad to see the meat disappear off my plate as I ate it
And the french fries were great too
This is definitely the palce to go to get your money's worth if you are looking for great steak in the city
My parents and I visited Frankie Johnnie's over the weekend and the food was incredible! I am not a big steak lover, but my father promised I would love the steak here and he was right
I had the sirloin and it was delicious and tender
I lso had the potatoes au gratin which were really good too
My parents loved their food, and of course there was enough leftover for everybody to walk away with a doggie bag
I can't wait to go back the Frankie johnnie's with my boyfriend
My fianc and I were there a few days ago and the service was exceptional! Our waiter was extremely attentive and even shared offered his service when I couldnt decide
The food was delicious and the wine selection was great
I would recommend Frankie and Johnnies fourless chocolate torte desert to anyone, it was amazing! My fianc and I would definitely go back
WE HAVE BEEN TO MANY HIGH CLASS RESTERAUNTS AND THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM
IF YOU WANT A RESTERAUNT WITH A NAME GO HERE
IF YOU WANT A GREAT STEAK AND ATMOSPHERE GO TO THE RIVER PALM IN NJ
EXPERIENCED THE WORST SERVICE (WAITRESS) FORGOT OUR SIDES
BROUGHT OUR STEAKS 1/2 WAY THRU OUR APPETIZERS
THEN BROUGHT THEM BACK WHEN WE WERE READY
IMMEDIATLEY OFFERED --- FREE AFTER DINNER DRINKS AND FREE SIDE
LIKE THIS HAPPENS ALOT
GAVE THE EXCUSE THAT THERE WAS A NEW  EXPEDITER
WE WILL NEVER GO BACK
DIDN'T EVEN GIVE US TIME TO DRINK OUR $100-  BOTTLE OF WINE
WHICH WE HAD TO POUR OURSELVES
Great steak, efficient service, appreciated recommendations from waiter which all resulted in positive experience
Everyone in our party of six was impressed and happy with the experience
A bit pricey, as all is ala carte, but overall a great time
Had 6:00 p
m reservation, we seated immediately, and finished with plenty of time to arrive at show without hurrying
The creamed spinach was wonderful! No room for dessert!
It is worth climbing a flight of black and white checkered stairs to get to the restaurant because once inside you are in for a treat
You feel like you have just stepped into the glamour of a 1950s movie
Old celebrity photos are everywhere, red chandeliers hang from the wall, and wood blinds cover the windows that overlook New Yorks Theatre District
Frankie and Johnnies is definitely the place to go if you are in the mood for a good meal at a classic restaurant
This is definitely the place to go if you are sick of the ultra-modern and ultra-chic restaurants that are taking over New York
The dcor is classic and old fashioned
And my waiter made me feel like I was one of the old celebrities whose autographed picture hung on the wall
And the food was good too! What more could you ask for?
We were abandoned
Sat for 1/2 hour before a waitress working another section noticed us and took our order
Never offered dessert
Had to order drinks from the kitchen runner and get the check from the ice water runner
Adjoining diners (who were receiving SOME service) were nonetheless also dissatisfied
A true shame, because the steaks are excellent
All in all, an amazing display of contempt for their patrons

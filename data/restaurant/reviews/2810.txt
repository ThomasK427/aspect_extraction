The plum wine at the end of the meal was a nice touch
Whoever says this place is no good obviously doesn't appreciate good food and service
The service here is wonderful
I'm a regular here and am always treated very well by the staff
The sushi is fresh and the portions are generous
You definitely get your money's worth
The ambience is another big assest of this restaurant
It's quiet and romantic
It's a great place to go on a date
I higly recommend this place to anyone who loves Japanese cuisine
I've never had a bad meal here
The sushi is not sushi, the waitress is not moving, the kitchen food is airplane quality, the place smells and I don't know why people go there
I went to this place twice, the first and the LAST
Their service can use a little assistance, but their food is great
Their sushi / sashimi is generous and their selections are best in the neighborhood
Whenever I'm in a mood for sushi and I don't want to travel out of the neighborhood, this is the place to go
Once a week my boyfriend and I go to the BEST SUSHI place in Forest Hills
We sit at the sushi bar and order their shrimp tempura rolls and the pink lady rolls mmmm
And the guys behind the bar already know us by our first names, but the perk of it is
if you come very often you start getting complementary dishes
my favorite is their salmon patties with eel sauce very good
In Short The much-copied look of hardwood floors, decorative stained glass, checked tablecloths, brass rails and walls filled with knickknacks has been a staple at this restaurant franchise
Originally a hit for its frisky bar scene, Friday's is now known just as much for its kid-friendly entrees
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers
I never thought that I would be reviewing a TGIF's but now that there is one opened in my neighborhood
This place is great for family gatherings and the occasional office party
Practically predictable with the food and service
Never been let down
A friendly spot
The beers on tap are worth the trip alone
Nothing but German fare
The owners are always there and will make you feel as part of the family right away
The food is great and you get a lot
good scnitzel and sausages
The crowd is mostly the senior citizen type but there is a good vibe here
Go Sunday late afternoons to hear some accordion and yoddeling! Highly Recommended!
I have been to the best and I travel from manhattan to Dee's without blinking an eye
the BEST! Grimaldi's is pretty good, Patsy's ehhh, Dee's is excellent! Try it and you will be a convert hands down!
I've been going to Dee's for years
They recently moved to a bigger location and created a really nice atmosphere
The decor is great for a romantic dinner; the service is incredible! And, the food is great! We usually order their pizza to go (try the chicken delight!) and then order their other menu items as we sit and dine
I definitely have a great experience whenever I go!
Dee's is the newest of many reasons that the neighborhood is a great place to be
From the owners to the staff to the food, all signs say Welcome Very conducive to meeting new neighbors, always a fun place to be without too much noise
New menu is a hit !
Husband and I love this place and do enjoy a nice meal at least 3 to 4 times a month here
Love the delicious Foccacia Bread and their great appetizer selection
Their Pizzas are great and you can order half portion pastas (How great is that for Weight conscious folks!!!!)
As for the staff, SUPERB, you can not find a friendlier group of young folks who are happy to serve you no matter what time of the day you are there or how exhasuted they are
DOn't foget to try Mama's rice pudding when it is available, seems mama is not always in the mood to make them ;) Make sure you have their coffee it is fantastic
One request pls don't fill up the salads with so much lettuce after all we are humans and not cows (This goes to all restaurants as well)
Delicious pizza- the best in the area
Service is fast and friendly, great menu
It is always very crowded so get there early
Forest Hills only real Authentic Wood Burning Brick Oven Pizza and more great salads, appetizers
pastas weekly entree sprecials
Great cheap wine list
Super Family Friendly!
I've been to all the BIG name sushi places in NY and after trying Mickey's Place i don't think i'll ever go to another
Warm and Friendly Staff, realy FAMILY atmosphere! A must Try!!!
I always thought that the best Sushi was in Manhattan
Think again
A friend of mine recommended this place and let me tell you, it rivals any top notch sushi joint
The fish is was fresh and tasty
I have eaten at some of the best places in Manhattan and this compares and may even be better
This is the ONLY place in Queens that I will get my sushi
This restaurant was recommonded to me by a co-worker so I already had high hopes going in there
I went with a group of six
We made reservations on that same night
When we arrived, we were seated within 10 minutes
The guys felt a bit under-dressed; we wore sweaters and jeans while the ladies were in business casual
The live piano music is a nice touch
Appetizer portions are very small
We only got three mushroom heads for the portobello mushrooms
The portions for the entrees did make up for it
My girlfriend and I had chicken entrees which were very good
However, those that ordered seafood were not satisfied
They complained their mussels and scallops weren't very good and hard to chew
They barely touched their plates
I had one mussel from an appetizer and thought it tasted fine
Different strokes for different folks I guess
Sometimes people make complaints about places without giving them a chance
(referring to an old review)
Portofino's is a very popular restaurant in Forest Hills and there is hardly ever a day you can visit and find it empty
The food is really good and the staff is kind and polite
Yes, there can be a day where it's very busy and so maybe you'll have to wait a little longer than usual for your food, but that's understandable
At least you have the ambiance and lovely live piano musice being played for you while you wait
If you're that hungry that you can't wait about 15 minutes for your meal, then go to a fast food restaurant where they plop your food in a plastic container
I love Portofino's and recommend it
Missed our reservation by 25 minutes and ended up waiting over an hour to be seated
understandable, the place was packed
We waited 15 minutes for our waiter to even come by
Then waited 30 minutes for our appetizers
getting annoyed
Our entrees finally arrive and only two of us (7 people) are satisfied with our orders
The service was lacking, and the food wasnt all that great for the nearly $300 bill
Maybe we should have just had pizza on the other side of Portofino
Was the place just off that night? I dunno but on a Sat night your restaurant should shine
Portofino did not
Food is great

wow! Red Cafe is my new favorite restaurant
This splash of red in a cozy setting with a friendly professional staff wooed my heart and salivary cravings
My husband and I visit family in Brooklyn and they took us here
The mixed green salad with roasted beets and goat cheese combines flavors that melt in your mouth
Fried calamari is the best I have had-crisp, tender and not greasy
The chef clearly buys fresh and knows how to blend herbs,spices and sauces to create mouth watering flavors that remain with you for the allure back to try more of his gastranomical wonders
The homemade chocolate bread pudding is like the cherry on top
I cannot rave about the Red Cafe enough!! Enjoy the lingering dreams of YOUR meal at this fine bistro
Walked by it at first, not realizing it was a restaurant
Delicious salads and appetizers each with a distinctive flair
Sumptuous entrees with vegetables cooked to perfection
Salmon, chicken and steak cooked and prepared like I have never had before
Creme brule and bread pudding finished it off for my small group
I was told that the chef is the owner and I loved his style
Service was efficient and friendly and the bartenders/waiters made some interesting variations on well-known cocktails
A decor of red with interesting wall hangings (included in the bathroom) make for a memorable experience
A truly great find
I can't wait to visit Brooklyn again
This restaurant was highly recommended to me and I was not disappointed
The food was top quality and delicious
What a find! The calamari was the best I've ever had
It was crispy and not greasy
The cod was perfectly cooked
I can't wait to have it again
The side dishes were perfect
I cannot say enough
We truly had a wonderful dinner and an overall nice dining experience
The ambiance is warm and not only was the food excellent but the service was friendly, yet professional
We started with the polenta topped with portobello mushrooms which was moist and flavorful
I then had the calves liver that literally melted in my mouth
It was smothered in onions and accompanied by delicous mashed potatoes and vegetables
My friend had the loin of pork which was cooked to perfection
He kept raving about the turnips and after I tried them I know why, they were so very good
We finished with the rasberry creme brulee
Needless to say, we left The Red Cafe very happy
This is definitely a keeper and well worth the trip to Park Slope
The area is also full of funky boutiques and shops, great overall experience and should not be missed
Yet another in the second wave of aspiring Italian and French restaurants now flooding Park Slope
This one has a nice, cozy ambience and a small but promising basic bistro menu
But the food is mediocre at best
I had the loin of pork, which came with some sort of mushroom-y gravy, the potatoes were almost inedible--and you have to work hard to ruin roasted potatoes--and the vegetable was almost as bad
The chef doesn't seem to have any idea what French cooking involves
Forgot to add that the bread pudding is TO DIE FOR!!!! As is the steak and fish
So glad Red Cafe is getting its due with the press - to match its loyal following
Everything on the menu is incredible - I think I have tried every amazing appetizer and the Pecan- crusted chicken and the steak are perfect
If you have room - forget it, even if you don't - the creme brulee is an eyes-roll-to-the-back-of-the-head sensation not to be missed
The room is adoreable and the staff - waiters and chef who you can see making your masterpiece - is great
Absolutely fabulous! The food is incredible
I started with the Boston Lettuce salad, very tasty - moved on to the phemonenal pecan crusted chicken with mustard sauce - and finished with the pecan pie and raspberry creme brulee - both, excellent
I highly recommend this fabulous restaurant!
Yuca is a fun restaurant! We went Saturday night- there was a 20 minute wait for two
We had drinks at the bar- the mojitos are super, almost syrup-y sweet, if you like drinks like that
Otherwise, I'd stick to the sangria- which is good
We ordered only tapas- overall, they were delicious
I definitely recommend the ceviche tasting- tuna, salmon, and white fish- so good! The meat skewers were fun- you get a little grill at the table to heat up the meats
However, the lobster quesadilla was disappointing- good quesadilla- no lobster, though
Also, I wouldn't go back on a Saturday night-it was unbearablely loud
Overall, great restaurant experience- avoid Saturday night
great place for birthdays, is one of the best places to take out of towner, or group of friends after work
The mojitos are to die for and the sangria is one of the best i've ever tried
Service is always attentive and quick, tapas are delicios and decent portions
The atmosphere is fun and you feel like you are on vacation somewhere else
I've been there many times and i'm definitely heading back soon
having been a steady customer at 7A (across the street) and after being informed that Yuca Bar shares the same owner, we looked forward to enjoying a good Latin inspired dinner
I will be kind and say that the only decent thing was the guacomole, the Paella was horrendous, it was served barely warm, most of the clams and mussels were not opened and was by far the worst paella we've ever eaten
we also ordered a special which was monk fish in a mango infused sauce
bland, small and awful, no presentation what so ever
, as far as the Sangria, strong doesn't always equal good, the rum totally took away from the fruity taste of a good spanish wine, no fresh fruit in it what so ever
We left hungry, we'll certainly never return, The service was unattentive as well
Had a party of about 12 people
We were seated quickly upon arrival and had 2 pitchers of great sangrias waiting for us
The food was absolutely awesome! along with great tapas and good portioned entrees, this restaurant is a money saver as well as an overall great dining expirience!
Their Sangria puts this alphabet city restaurant/lounge on the map as one of the best sangria in Lower Manhattan
My favorite tapas include the amazing Arepas, crispy Yuca fries that will make you wish you grew up eating these fries, Mussels served in a mouth-watering sauce (make sure to ask for a side of bread, this sauce is amazing!) and the Ribs that melt in your mouth
If youre in a large party, make sure to include their main dish called Carnitas which offers 4 different types of succulent meats and the following side dishes (Yuca fries, rice/beans and vegetables in a hot sauce)
My husband and I went here with another couple for New Years, and we had a great time! As soon as we walked in, we were seated
The drinks were strong, the white sangria was amazing! The lobster quesadillas were the best I ever had
We had the Yucca fries,which were absolutely awesome! They were the type of food that you will crave for days after
The prices were extremely reasonable,and the atmosphere was great
I would definately go there again!!
Upon entering the doorway, the host, with a sour expression confirmed the number of guests in my party, and as he grabbed mentions, while turning on foot, told me outside beverages were not permitted
Oh, could I pour my coffee in one of your mugs? Without considering or even an apologetic, No
Sorry -it's policy, he just said no
Funny, I have been able to before
Yeah
Well, was his reply
The water was tepid, the coffee is horrible, and when food came out, we had to search for our own condiments at another table
Are you kidding me? I rather take my chances across the street at 7A
I've been in the restaurant about 10 times already and haven't been disappointed once
The food is delicious, the chef is a master of sauces
they make every dish seem like its a 5star restaurant
The food is served with great aesthetics without overdoing it
The portions are perfect
And besides great food the drinks are strong and delicious (at happy hour $5, cant be topped) Caprioskas are delicious
But my favorite part of the meal is the cafe con leche
It's perfectly Europeian-quality strong coffee without the bitterness of  overburning
Prob the best coffee I've tried in the city
Oh and on weekends its open until 3am
yum HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
My friends and I made plans to go out on Friday for some good latin food and decide to go to Yuca Bar since we've been there for brunch and we love it, we figured dinner has to be good

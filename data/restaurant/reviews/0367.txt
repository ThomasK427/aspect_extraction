The sushi/sashimi for two is a GREAT value
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken
Their sake martini is wonderful
I find the service to be so friendly and very quick, and we are often greeted w/edamame on the house
It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn
the food in general seems to be average at best, certain dishes seem to shine more than others and portions sizes seem to vary greatly, i ordered the salmon thai style and was presented a nice size portion but when i bit into it i was greeted with an over cooked filet that lacked the quality i was expecting it tasted like the salmon you buy in bulk at a costco or sams club, the curry sauce accompanying it was very watery and seemd to be dependent on chunks of canned pineapple to bring out its taste
My friend ordered the sea bass and was given food that would only fil a small child with its tiny portions the sauce used for the bass was a basic brown sauce that any chinese takeout spot in nyc can make with ease
In an area strangely devoid of decent Chinese, Faan was one of our local favs for basic asian dishes
Delivery is *fast*, often arriving in only 20 mins (7 blocks away!)
But food quality is hit or miss -- and recently, more miss
Noodle dishes taste like stale oil, with no real flavor
Fried dishes are HEAVY and dripping with grease
Appetizers are chewy, soggy, and bland
I know we're not the only ones to experience this; what was once a jam packed business is now rarely crowded
Faan needs some fresh blood in the kitchen -- c'mon, guys, let's get it together!
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced
Try their chef's specials-- they are to die for
Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
ok, so after dinner with my friend here, we felt kind of disapointed cause the sushi was the only real good thing to have
the rest wasnt that good and the service wasnt professional
try some other places on this street
Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery
My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent
Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent
Faan is sooo good
The best pad thai i've ever had
The design and atmosphere is just as good
bottles of wine are cheap and good
What more could you want?
Great food -- but some of the worst service in the neighborhood
Also, terrible noisy interior, outside is worse
Yes, i am sure manhattan has better places
Why don't you stay there
Yes, stay there
Don't come here
I hear it's really bad and lousy
And costs a lot
Yes, stay in manhattan
Go to somewhere else
Yes
Stay
Sit
Stay
We stop in at least once a month for a great deal on a pan-Asian treat
Food is always tasty and interesting and is solid value
Even their beers are pan-Asian - Sapporo and Singha
Terrific after a weekend shopping stroll
I'm a long-term patron of Faan, often going 3-5 times per month with friends for really good, affordable dishes
Over the past months (around the time of their larger expansion) I have seen a steady decline of both the service and the quality
This was affirmed last night when I ordered a dish that has long been my favorite (the sesame chicken) and it arrived fatty and with an off taste
I broke a few pieces apart, hoping that it was just a bad piece left in the fryer too long
Such was not the case
The server was rude and said that I had picked it apart and that I should have told him right away
We were offered a 10% discount--which we declined
(insulting) I'm sad to see it go, but it seems quality is just not there anymore at what used to be one my favorites
Large menu
Great outdoor seating as well as indoor seating
Cool bar underneath
All around fun place eat
With the growing restaurant scene on Smith, go elsewhere
This pan-Asian restaurant is symbolic of what is wrong with many pan-Asian places - mediocre food under the guise of exotic cuisine
Spend your money elsewhere
Good sound system downstairs, DJ can be good but beware of weak drinks
I've been going to this place religiously for the past year (and am responsible for bringing in some of the other ratings down below) and I can't say enough about this place
EXCELLENT food, great service, BEAUTIFUL decor
Fa'an has it all
Their sushi is to DIE for and their meals always have huge servings
Should I die, make Fa'an my resting place
The lychee martinis were awesome and the sushi i've had was very good
definitely a good value
i've never had a bad meal here
the bar downstairs - barbelow - is pretty chill
I love food
I have a passion delicious food i've never tasted before!
Last night, a friend of mine treated me to dinner at Faan's
Oh my lawd!
I almost had a food orgasm right there while eating the WoW Roll!!!
That was food heaven on earth!
The mixture of white fish, salmon, crabmeat, the crunchy outter layer and the special sauce is to DIE and i do mean to DIE for!! Not only did i eat part of his, but I then had to order it for myself
No way was I leaving there without the pleasure of eating my own roll! I also enjoyed the lychee martini!!
I'll make sure i have two of those next time
The portions are indeed large
I had to take half of my entree home
Check it out!
Its a beautiful thing!
This has quickly become a neighborhood mainstay
The decor is cheerful and clever, and the menu is a good mix of various asian staples
The prices are good, so it's hard to grumble too much, but the kitchen has definitely slipped recently
I guess the it moment has passed, and now it's settling for comfortable respectability
In Short This steel and earth-toned bar, eatery and late-night delivery station--furnished with a couple of roomy booths in addition to stools and tall tables--strategically catches the overflow from North Sixth Street's row of nightspots
Soups, grilled sandwiches and salads, along with Middle Eastern lamb burgers, enchiladas and pierogies, satisfy the after-hours or lunchtime munchies
There's also a weekend brunch, big on poached eggs, omelets and bagels and lox, plus fresh-squeezed OJ
They have a great menu, lots of different choices, and the food is usually really good
Love the tuna melt, fresh mozz/potabello/basil sandwich, fries
The delivery takes up to and sometimes over an hour

I remember when they were about half a block closer to the promenade
That place was very small and cozy
You could view the chef preparing your food
The new location is very nice but not as cozy as the original
In any event you cannot go wrong with the Chicken cutlet parm over spaghetti
One of my all time favorite places to eat in New York
I compare every other Italian restaraunt to La Traviata
You will too
When you have a pasta craving but are tired of the pasta bars, head down the block to La Traviata for a real sit-down meal
They offer standard Italian fare, including decent calarami and of course pasta (haven't found anything I didn't like yet)
Even the sauted spinach was good
The portions are huge so we've only made it to dessert once
The wine list is limited but sufficient
The staff is friendly and the dining room is nicer than expected
Overall
its a good neighborhood standby
I just went for the first time
The service was so friendly and the food was fresh which is really important for seafood
I found the simple decor charming somehow
It was refreshing to be in restaurant with good food but not trendy and stylish
Altho it wouldn't hurt to add a few pictures on the wall
There's a good reason why Mr
Souvlaki is virtually empty every evening
Its uninspired, boring menu and moderate prices cater to city and state office workers who may not know any better
But when the workers go home, Brooklyn Heights residents don't go near Mr
Souvlaki
For most locals, this is another bad Montague St
restaurant that seems to be on the do not return to list
Mr
Souvlaki has been a Brooklyn Heights staple since I was a kid 25 years ago
For a restaurant to weather that kind of time in NYC, it must have and keep developing a loyal following
And since there's so much great food to choose from in NYC, there is plenty of comeptition
Mr
Souvlaki's food tastes just as wonderful today as it did 25 years ago
Try the Greek sausage and don't skip the side of greek style potatoes
Everything on the menu is made as it should be - no skimping here
The portions are generous and the staff is always friendly
This is one of the places that makes Cobble Hill great
The owner roasts his own meats and makes fabulous and interesting sandwiches--the house-roasted ham with celery-root salad and tomatoes on a baguette deserves a prize
He also makes a decent croissant and usually has some good hard-to-find cheeses
The deli doubles as a small French grocery as well, with nice jams, jellies, and other imported delights
Service is a bit slow, but otherwise, highly recommended
They toast the sandwiches and offer great varieties
Really good stuff and cheap at that! Best deli on the block
this place has always been good, every time i'v egone here
it's cheap too and the woman who runs the place is always friendly
i recommend it to anyone on a budget looking for healthy middle eastern
vegetarian friendly too
If you like shish kabobs, falafel, baklawa, mint tea than you'll love this place
The ambience is plain, but the place is well kept
The food is delicious--everything from the vegetable soup to the babaghanouj to the eggplant wrap is worth trying
The prices are fare and the portions are big
Not only that but the service is great
This place is best when you have it delivered or to go
For professionals such as myself in the Downtown Brooklyn- Court Street area good restaraunts are hard to come by
This restaraunt is an oasis in a wilderness of so- so cuisine
This was very good middle eastern cuisine a diverse menu, decent service and a clean facility
I would definately recommend this restaraunt to anyone
It is great food at a decent price
Great food and great service make this restaurant stand out
Best Middle Eastern food I have had in New York
By far, the best middle eastern food in the city
What it lacks in decor it more than makes up in the cuisine
This place has great middle eastern food! The babaganoush is out of this world! I've only had delivery but it's alway fast and hot and yummy!
I eat pizza at least 6 times a week
I've tried out a hundred or so pizza joints in the 5 boroughs
I've been eating Fascati's pizza since I was 5 and its the only place I'll go out of my way for
Because I grew up on it you may think I am biased, that my taste for pizza was molded by Fascati's
Fascati's pizza was not my first pizza, nor did they deliver to my home when I was growing up so it wasn't that easy to get but it was the only one I begged for
I won't try to describe the pizza because I can't define heaven but yes it is thin crust, but not paper thin (the cardboard line from above is laughable)
They dont use a ton of sauce or cheese like many other places
They have simply found the perfect balance
Fascati's is the best pizza in Brooklyn, second only to Grimaldi's (who don't deliver)
The crust is thin yes, but like cardboard no
Fascati's makes thin and deep dish style pizza, its tough to decide which is better
The sauce is filled with spices, including fresh garlic and basil
The only reason I can imgaine anyone wouldn't like it is if they were a realtive of Patys
only complaint is sometimes they are so popular its tough to get them on the phone to order
Quick, well priced and tasty
I have been going to Fascati's pizza since I have been able to eat solid food and have never found a slice of pizza I like more
The only thing better than the pizza (if possible), are the meatball and the eggplant parm heros
Every time I come back home, my first meal is always at Fascati's
They are the best!  Everyone there is nice and the food is CHEAP (especially the dinners)
Everyone I have ever taken there swears by it - try it!
Consistently thin crust and yummy toppings
Fast delivery with friendly service!!
I grew up on Fascatis pizza
From when I was old enough to eat pizza up until now, it has been my favorite pizza
I compare all pizza to fascatis which, for a pizza lover like me, leaves me frequently disappointed
If Fascatis ever closes I don't know what I will do!
I just moved to Front Street in DUMBO and was happy to find this establishment
Since my first day, they have treated my like one of the community
The owner and workers are great and totally friendly! The Pizza is Awesome and they always have a variety of speciality pizza slices
In edition, they have pasta and other entree choices along with an excellent quick breakfast (omlet and homefries ext)
Highly Reccommended!
I really like this lil' pizza hole
$8 pies on Mondays
The delivery guy always smiles and brings my pizza all hot and fresh like
It's a good pie
Definitely the best pizza I've ever had, great value, and quick service - highly recommended!

The food was divine, with interesting and fresh ingredients from the Union Square Green Market
It was nice to see that some people do still know what service means
From the front door to our desert, as soon as you thought you wanted something there was someone getting it for you
But they did it in such a way that you weren't even aware they were anywhere near by to know it
Don't skip desert
We shared apple cider donuts with an apple compote and maple cream and an olive oil cake with burnt sugar icecream which was savory and delicious
We plan to return every season to see what they create
It was just lovely
I went to Hearth very soon after it opened and had a not so great experience
Paul Greico (who is so nice!) wanted to make sure that I came back to see what a great restaurant it really is, and I was definitely convinced! Everyone on the staff was very helpful and friendly
Everything that we had to eat was absolutely amazing
They even wrote Happy Birthday on my dessert because my friend mentioned that it was my b-day on our way in
I highly recomment Hearth - it's perfect for a date, a group of friends, if there's someone you want to impress, if your parents are in town, pretty much any occasion!!
I really enjoyed my dinner at Hearth
The food is very good, creative and incorporates interesting flavors
The fish was great as was the salad choices and the wait staff is very knowledgeable on the preparation of each dish
The only downside is the wine list
The idea of a seasonal wine list limits options, causes the vintages to be very young and provides for poor accompaniaments to a great menu
This is the only area that needs improvement
As a note, the room does get a little noisy as the evening progresses- especially if there are large groups dining
Our server was amiable without being overly solicitous
The wine list had a number of very interesting options and seemed to have been put together with an eye on offering maximum value given the ridiculous American markup
The star of the evening is the food, which is wonderfully prepared to reveal the freshness and quality of the raw materials and the talents of the chef
I could mention many aspects of our dinner, but I'll signal out the monkfish wrapped in prosciutto which was well conceived and executed
The goat milk panna cotta appropriately had only a hint of garnish--letting the taste of the milk take center stage
Each course is an exercise in simplicity and balance
My only complaint is that the portions of the apps
and entrees were a bit small--should be about 20% bigger
We were looking forward to a nice meal, instead for $50 including tip for each of us ($150 for our total bill ) we got food that was way over-hyped
My complaint is the food, if it was good, our table of 3 would have enjoyed the meal
Alas, the meal itself was terrible, we can only remember that sometimes you try places that aren't worth it
Was really excited to check this place out based on previous reviews
Was very disappointed
This East Village spot looked like you walked into an empty room where they threw a few tables in and opened up a restaurant - completely devoid of style or ambiance
Waiters dressed in country barn style outfits (striped button downs, Levis jeans and girls hair up in buns) and the menu was all over $20/plate w/ not a lot of great options
My bass was just ok and friend's steak was poorly prepared and teeny
Chocolate tart dessert was just ok
They need to class up this joint and make it a little less boring and 'un-romantic' before I'd go back
What a great restaurant! I felt compelled to write my first online review
Had a great meal on Sat
night
What a find
The service was top notch
Attentive without being obtrusive
Never felt rushed nor ignored
The perfect balance
And the food-truly great
Wine selection and entrees to die for
The raviolo was one of the best tasting things I have ever had
While the starters and entrees were more than filling, I had to indulge in dessert
The chocolate tart with creamy peanut brittle ice cream still lingers
Prices are high, but you definitely get what you pay for
Great service, better food, a top notch dining experience
Nick - thanks again!
what a delicious menu
I sampled everything around my table, and it's too much to write about everything, except for it was all amazing
Great wine too
The service was well executed and in rhythm
Want to impress a date? Check out their service
Not cheap, but well worth the value
Great place
I went for a friend's birthday and the servers were very accomodating
It took a long time to get a reservation though (a month in advance)
The food is great but the desserts are even better
It was hard to decide what to order
Try the apple cider doughnuts
They're delicious
While the food and drinks were amazing, what sets Hearth apart from so many NYC restaurants is the gracious, completely attitude-less staff, from the hostess who sincerely apologized for making us wait all of five minutes for our table, to the friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff who asked right off the bat if iced water was okay and gave us the perfect amount of time in between courses
We will definitely go back
Too much of the service it herky-jerky
The goal of simultaneously setting down plates, unobtrusive silverware changes and all the like service steps are a long way from being smooth so in the end come off as being clumsy and obtrusive despite the good intentions which may be better suited for tableclothed restaurants in the end anyway
The food is solid and for the most part plays it safe
Not pushing bottled water is a great plus
Those were the words I used to describe my birthday dinner to the hostess- better than my last meals at Craft and Gramercy
It is rare that I eat a meal then cry, To the internet! to rate it
This was one such meal
My red snapper crudo, veal with sweetbreads, side of hen of the woods mushrooms and apple cider doughnuts were masterfully done
My veggie girlfriend's salad with beets, spinach cannelloni, side of gnocchi and milk chocolate tart were equally tasty
All of the above for $144, including wine, was a steal
I will go back
Good Looking people, warm atmosphere, Excellent food and amazing service! Really nice place, we had to wait 30 hour longer than our reservation time yet they kindly made up for it by buying us a round of drinks at the bar
The veal was amazing!  Not knowing what to expect I was really happy!
I was more impressed with the food, service, and wine selections at Hearth than any other restaurant I've been to in the last year
The red-snapper appetizer was amazing as was the pan-seared tasmanian sea trout
The friendliness and attentiveness of our waiter Nick was in tune with the rest of the staff, especially the bartender and host/owner
My friend an I were blown away by this restaurant
Chef Marco is a genius! I recommend this place to one and all
Hearth is an excellent and appreciated addition to the neighborhood
You will enjoy one of the best restaurant experiences in NYC, with lovely food, great service and a nice ambiance
We went the night before Valentine's Day and everything was fabulous
Our waiter was a little stressed and brought a couple things out late and as a result, he gave it to us on the house
This restaurant is a step above most and is a great value
We plan on going back real soon! I definitely recommend the hen of the woods mushrooms as a side, the flavor lingers for days
On Valentine's Day both the food and service were perfect
Our waiter helped us pick an excellent wine that was fairly inexpensive and we were not rushed through the whole three course meal
It is rare to find a restaurant that is full all night (fully reserved mignight seating) that pays the attention to each table that Hearth does
Absolutely incredible
and the apple cider doughnuts should not be missed!
Went there tonight and the food was fabulous and well executed
The braised octopus was great as was the woodhen mushrooms

unbelievable food
we just couldn't find anything to complain
it's not cheap eat, but great place for special occasion
The view from this restaurant of the Downtown and Midtown skyline is truly unbelievable
The food was above average and the staff was very attentive and friendly
My wife and I spent our anniversary there and thouroughly enjoyed the evening
We had a late seating and actually got moved to an empty window seat to have dessert (they offered, didn't have to ask)
I highly recommend for any 'special event' dining if you are visiting NY
If I remember correctly from Nov 2003, the pre-fixe meal was around $70 per person
I took my boyfriend here for a special Bon Voyage dinner, and not only did the maitre'd remember to mention that (I'd written it on my online reservation), but overall--a truly lovely experience
Yes, it's pricey, but for the sigh-worthy view, the romantic ambience, the food quality, and the congenial but not in-your-face service, it's totally worth it for a special occasion
I chose the River Cafe as a place that would wow my sweetie, and it definitely succeeded
I'm so glad we went
(My one regret, a table of mafioso types who came in without the required jacket for men and who got a little obnoxious
If you don't dress and act the part--why come to such a classy restaurant??)
A while back a couple of friends from Europe treated me to the dinner here
We looked forward to a great experience and had the 7course tasting menu and wine
What a dissapointment: the fish was much too salty (didn't complain), the main course not edible (now we told the waiter) There was absolutely no reaction, not even a sorry
We did not TIP and were then approached by the Chef de Service
I work in the industry and know mistakes happen, but this arrogance is not excusable, even if they think we were just tourists
I am telling everyone not to go there
This is one of the BEST places in the city (including Brooklyn) to go for a special occasion
The place is perfectly situated on the water under the Brooklyn Bridge with an amazing view of the bridge and the downtown skyline
When you walk in, it looks and smells like a florist shop with gorgeous flowers
It's an actual barge (but it doesn't rock because it's set in a frame) so it's right on the water
The service was terrific and even though we were late for our reservation (it takes about 40 min by subway from the Upper West Side with walking but it's worth it) the friendly maitre'd gave us a table by the window
The food was delicious and creative
I can't say enough good things about the whole experience
Take the restaurant's own ferry there, its romantic and the skyline is great! Leaves from the Heliport on 34 East
Last year We had our wedding reception at The River Cafe
It was incredible! The food was wonderful, staff took care of our guests every need
No one wanted the night to end and the view wasn't too bad either! If you are planning any future events give them a call
you will not be disappointed
The citysearch photo doesn't do this place justice
I met a friend here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch and was so impressed with the beautiful flowers they had everywhere - outside, hallway, dining area, etc
Service is very friendly and unobtrusive
$35 price fixe brunch includes appetizer and main course
The closest thing to a traditional brunch selection was their waffles, pancakes and eggs benedict - everything else was much more gourmet
The salmon appetizer was amazing and my lamb was delicious - cooked to perfection
The view and ambiance are perfect - I'd definitely like to go back for dinner to see the view at night
With a spectacular location and view like the River Cafe has you can forgive a lot
The service was impeccible, the menu traditional but inventive and presentation for the mostpart excellent but the food itself came up short
For $250 for 3 for lunch, I expected more
The lamb was way too salty, lobster tail tough
Crab cake and shortribs though were top notch
You'll come for the view and be happy with the service but will think again before coming again at the price/performance they offer
I would suggest opting for the fish instead of any steak
Their Stripped Sea Bass and King Salmon are fabulous
On the other hand, all red meat lacks something
The wait staff is very attentive, and you can smoke at the bar while enjoying the view of the river
Took my wife and our two grown kids there for an anniversary dinner and had a great experience! This is one of the prettiest restaurants in all of NYC! That, coupled with great food and service made the evening a memorable one for each of us
The appetizers were spectacular (try the gnocchi with spare rib shavings) and the main courses were dazzling, as well (had a pork loin special that was just that!) Desserts were also first-rate! A great place!!
My Fiancee and I went here on Jan 10th, the night we got engaged and it was the perfect venue for such a special evening
The view is sensational and worth the money alone
The service was extremely attentive and the food was fantastic, particularly the Foie Gras starter and Seabass and Steak main courses
It is pricey, but worth every penny
The restaurant is beautifully decorated inside and out and the view will stay with you for a long time
We cant wait to go back for our first Anniversary!
This place is all about the view
It's so pretty
Great place for a date
The food was a little too fancy for my liking though
River Cafe is top notch dining all the way
Oh you will pay dearly for it, but it's all worth it
You can't beat the view
I thought it was cool how they seated us side by side so that we were all facing the water
The food must was concocted by a mastermind of flavor chemistry
Every item I ate had multiple dimensions: the initial flavor, the secondary flavor, and then the aftertaste all of amazing quality
Like a good piece of jazz music, it brought my mind to another place and time
Seriously, though, it's very expensive
A priced fixed dinner for two plus a bottle of (cheap) wine and tip cost over $180
But I don't regret a damn thing!
My fiance I went here in Mid-October on the night we got engaged
It was a wonderful dining experience from start to finish
The staff knew of the special occasion before hand and was extremely attentive and accommodating without being smothering
The ambiance and decor is unmatched by any other restaurant in the city
If there was anything about River Cafe that was not perfect, it would be the food
Granted, our meals were very good, but it lacked any uniqueness that you get at other top restaurants
Overall, you can't miss at River Cafe for a special occasion
Highly recommend
My family of 4 turned up on a busy evening, with no booking and found ourselves sitting at the best seats in the house in a short time and in the middle of a real buzz of an atmosphere
My son was immediately found a jacket with no fuss
The views are jaw-dropping, Statue of Liberty on the left, Empire State on the right, the Manhattan skyline in between, with the Brooklyn Bridge soaring above us - just wonderful
The food and service were excellent (perhaps not up to the best that London has to offer, but that's no criticism), and we all had a wonderful evening
Cost on 29th Dec 02, including a hefty tip, for 3 courses, pre-drinks, 3 bottles of wine, including pink champagne - $726
88
Expensive? Well, 4 people for 4 hours is about $45 per hour
How much is Madison Square Garden?
I took my gf here for our 6-month anniversary and was disappointed
I must admit, the food was excellent and very creative, however you did pay for it
The staff was extremely attentive and helpful with wine selection
Still, the decor and atmosphere suffered from a decidedly bridge and tunnel crowd that was very old and, in some cases, embarassingly drunk on very expensive wine
It really ruins the romantic effect that was it's selling point
My boyfriend and I went there last week - we were very excited to go to this beautiful restaurant
After eating the food there, we both decided never to go there again
My seared foie gras was overwhelmed by an unnecessary hard nut crust
My lamb mixed grill is at best called mediocre - the baby eggplant stuffed with lamb sausage had absolutely no flavor
My boyfriend had lobster bisque as appetizer and Maine lobster as entree
Both tasted very ordinary, and the portion of the lobster entree was very small
The worst was their signature dessert - Brooklyn Bridge chocolate torte - it tasted like a few days old

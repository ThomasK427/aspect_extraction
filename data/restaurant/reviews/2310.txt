The only saving grace was the dessert and the all you can eat mussels which my friend enjoyed
I wouldn't go back as it's definitely way overpriced for what you get
Was just walking in the neighborhood and stop by at La Tour because of the mussels at $18
00 (everything you can eat mussels and french fries, it's really a good deal) The place is a typical French Bistro, you feel like you are in France
The service was nice and fast
good atmosphere
will come back to try something else
The all you can eat mussels fries is a great deal, my favorite : the ground mustard ! The atmosphere is always very nice and I love the decor
I've been coming here for years, and have noticed just how everything fell apart in past couple of years
The extraordinary food that I was returning for just is tasteless these days
They have added some lights on the ceiling, that - in combination with all the stuffy decor - truly make the place feel clogged
The service is slow and inatentive
I'm sorry to say but I won't be returning to this past favorite
This is a great, cozy restaurant when you want to go out but want to stay local
The food as well as the wine list is very good and of great value
My husband had the tuna tar tar which was delicious and I had the mussles which are all you can eat if you are so inclined
We ordered a $30 dollar bottle of wine and were impressed by how good it was
In a city where it is easy to spend a fortune on food, La Tour is a refreshing place to have a dependable meal
La Tour is a cozy, romantic restaurant
However, for the price of the food, the value is forgettable
I had a steak which was nowhere near as impressive as my date's duck, which was on the specials list
Although this is a good place for a nice, quiet conversation, I would recommend elsewhere for unforgettable cuisine
The previous reviews about this place are mixed
Basically I agree with all of them
The trick to enjoying this restaurant is appreciating it for what it is- a mediocre pseudo-french bistro-moules-frites place
If you're on a budget and you are craving lots and lots of mussels, go to this place
Try the mustard mussels instead of the garlic ones
Better moules frites at petite abeille
Luckily, I was taken here on a date, so I was fortunate not to have dropped the couple of hundred dollars that my date shelled out since the entire experience was pleasant, but not outstanding
For a bottle of decent Merlot, two bland pates, two boring fish entrees, espressos and coffee, and two nothing-special desserts, the entire meal came to $200
Since the atmosphere is not entirely romantic and the food was certainly nothing to write home about, I cannot see why it is worth the high costs
Without trying to overly insult the patrons of La Tour, I left this restaurant thinking that returnees really have no idea of what constitutes good food
Neither do the owners/chefs of this less than mediocre restaurant
The endive salad was poorly presented with leaves that were brown around the edges
The beef tartare was overly doctored up with too many condiments
Lastly, the mussels were a true disappointment
Gritty with sand, dried out and overly cooked, with a tastless broth to boot
I now know to stick to my favorite, Jubilee (54th b/w 1 and 2), to have mussels the way they ought to be done
Do yourselves a favor and absolutely skip this place
This is how to do it, grab some barstools, a bottle of wine, and order the AYCE mussels and frites for FOUTEEN BUCKS! Come on, they are yummy and keep coming
I have never had any other food here, but the mussels are great and the frites are comparable to McDonalds (this is a good thing)
Now that I wrote about this place, I think I will pay them a visit real soon
You should too, but save a stool for me
The $15 mussels and fry deal really caught our eye, but the mealy, tasteless and COLD mussels and soggy, bland fries we were served kept me from asking for seconds
Don't waste your time - the ambience is as bland and service as offensive as the food
The setting is a charming bistro with attentive service, amazing dishes and an excellent choice of wines
After a drink at the bar we were seated promptly in a comfortable table
The service was great -- recommending a number of dishes and daily specials
I highly recommend the braised lamb which is perfectly prepared and a great value
For dessert the chocolate mousse was fantastic
All in all, a great restaurant for a date, with family or friends
I am disposed to liking bistros, knowing full well that the food is not the point
This place, while bustling and built for fun, served me without a doubt the worst excuse for a hanger steak that I've ever hadit tasted like they grilled it the day before, microwaved it when I placed my order, and left it out to congeal for good measure before they brought it to the table
Insult to injury, the pompous manager refused to make good on it
Everything else, including the frites and the frisee salad, was strictly mediocre
If you are indifferent to what you put in your mouth, go to La Tour
La Tour is one of my all time favorite restaurants
I started going there just for the mussels and French fries all you can eat for $15
00 on Monday nights
You can't go wrong with that
I think now every night you can get the same deal
Besides that they have a limited but good menu of French food and a very extensive wine list
Staff had always been very friendly
Most night I had no problem getting a table without the reservation but lately I recommend making a reservation
Outdoor/sidewalk seating is a plus
You can also practice your French with the owners
On a sunny day, sit outside, have a huge burrito with gaucamole
drink a Carona
Food was great, it was quick, and we were starving from shopping and walking around the upper east side
Great pit stop
The Burritos are BIG and hearty
I especially like the Lost in Austin, Spinach and Mushroom Burrito
Good, FRESH Guacamole and it's nice to have a choice of burrito-wraps
(Plain, Spinach, Whole Wheat or even Chipotle Tortillas
) A great place for vegans - as they have soy cheese and tofu sour cream available
Try the Tacquitos for a change of pace
(Chicken, Cheese or both rolled in a tortillas freid
) Sinful but delish! Served with Salsa Fresca and Sour Cream
(Tofu or regular
)  YUM!
Real or soy cheese and sour creme, hand-made salsa and chips while you wait
real chipolte peppers, substantial chunks of meat in anything you want, and a house brand of lemonade keeps me coming back
The eat-in facilities are no more spartan than anywhere else, and eat the food has a depth that's lacking in most East Coast Mexican food
the lunch special which is 2 dollars more than other chinese restaurants in the neighborhood
the girl behind the counter was rude and nasty and scowled when i asked for hot pepper oil then threw it in my bag
the hot and sour soup was greasy and I can taste the heavy sesame oil coating my tongue! same thing for the chow mein which was also oily and soupy
the shrimp with lobster sauce was overly eggy in a gross way
waste of money
Hunan Balcony isn't going to win any awards, but it certainly gets the job done as far as neighborhood Chinese goes
The service is fair at best, but the food is solid, there is plenty of variety on the menu, and the portions are hefty
Delivery service is prompt, and the food is always hot when it arrives
Value-wise, they are very reasonable with their prices
I dine there regularly
What a dump! While the food is both inexpensvie and filing it is not particularly good
Very quick service, but low-quality and full of grease!  The ambience is non-existence and needs a good cleaning
Not a good choice
The food here is really good, among the better chinese take-outs too on the upper east side, the staff is very friendly and the meat and food is fresh, however, not suitable for large groups due to the restaurant lay-out
Try the Peking Duck rolls!!!
good for fast take out, but that is it
beter chinese restaurants in the UES to dine at

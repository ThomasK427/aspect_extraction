As I situated myself into my cushy arrangement - I glanced at the cocktail menu first - let me tell you dee-licious! I immediately ordered the Spiced Peach Cobbler Cocktail - my guest ordered the Bleeding Cactus
Aaahh
how refreshing! I never thought that I could have a better Mac Cheese, but to my surprise the cheese and mac melted in my mouth - I wanted to swim in it
I then proceeded with the Fish Chips - I was expecting Chips to be french fries - but they were these little yummy potato goodness! The Fish was excellent
To top my meal we shared the PBJ dessert - so don't walk or run to have this dessert - jump in a cab!
Anyone who has negative comments on this site about 24 Prince must have walked into the wrong place by accident
There is nothing not to like
I have been 5x already, with my girlfriend, with 2 guys, with a group for a bday dinner, and everytime has been a memorable experience
The staff and owners have been super friendly, and are quick to recognize a familiar face
The food is superb and affordable
You cannot go wrong with any entree and the PB J dessert is reason enough to frequent this new gem
Keep doing what you are doing 24 Prince, and I will see you again very soon and very often
24 Prince has quickly become my new go-to spot in Nolita
The rest of the neighborhood seems to agree as I tend to see familiar faces each and every time I visit
The bbq pizza, meatloaf, and fried chicken are the best I have had in a while
The staff is always friendly and on point
If you have not been to 24 Prince yet, you are really missing out
My bday brunch reservation was made over the phone for 11:00 a
m
the following day
When I and my 8 friends showed up, the restaurant was closed
After waiting around for a 1/2 hour outside in the cold, they finally opened
I told the hostess, who impatiently told me they open at 11:30, and had no sympathy and very little interest in the mistake they had made, even arguing that their website says 11:30
Which it does not
Nor did their phone message
Nor did the person I spoke to who took my reservation
The mistake was theirs yet I was treated to a healthy dose of attitude while they started to set up a lousy table
I tried to be understanding and patient, but finally had enough of the hostess snipey comments and we went next door where we had a lovely time
24 Prince is nasty
When we arrived for our 11AM reservation, the restaurant was closed
From inside, someone gestured, 'five minutes'
That kind of sucked, because we did have a reservation and it was 35*F, but OK
We've worked in the industry, so we understand
They let us inside a full half-hour late without even a, 'sorry for the wait
' When we told the hostess we had a reservation for 11AM, she became defensive and condemning, insisting she knew nothing about our reservation, adding they don't open until 11:30
Now, we made a reservation--with a person--for 11AM; and as of this review, their Citysearch page, and their voicemail both say 11AM, so her attitude was pretty alarming
When finally she tried to put us at a crappy table, we decided to leave
We could roll with a few miscues, but all that AND the unflinching attitude? We won't be back
Great crowd and attractive interior
The service, however, was quite poor
Waited ages for a glass of wine
Food was not all that hot
although Im not a huge comfort food fan so I may be bias
Overall not a terrible experience but I wont be back
I had my bday dinner here and thought the food and ambiance were great
I would recommend the meatloaf,steak, and maccheese
The only drawback was that it was pretty noisy and a little hard to hear
Wine bottles started @$25!
A great little hot spot on Prince Street
Understated, cool, non-stuffy, simple, yet with a touch of chic, this is a moderately-priced gem, filled with cool cats, good vino, and great ambience
The service was increidibly generous and warm
In fact, after our wait turned into the long side, we were graciously taken care of by the bartender and manager
A super experience
This is a great place to get out of the cold and enjoy comfort-like food kicked up a notch
Great salads, meatloaf, asparagus perfectly cooked
Bravo 24 Prince
This Prince Street gem is an immediate neighborhood favorite
The atmosphere is perfect, whether sitting down for dinner or just having a drink at the bar and engaging the friendly bartenders in converasation
This restaurant is here to stay because the food is delicious at a reasonable price
I have been to 24 on days when I wanted to indulge in Pig N Blankets, Mac-n-cheese, and Fried Chicken, and others when I wanted to be healthy, and ordered a Ceasar Salad and the Bass - either way the food is always tasty and leaves you satisfied
Don't miss this place!!!
careless staff, 45 min wait for food, asked for more bread for waiting- bread was run out, mix up on the food (ordered food came 30 minutes after everyone's arrived) manager offered a mini appetizer in the meantime but was not apologetic at all
Finally, we were offered discount on the bill even though bill was also wrong
No need to say more
You must dine at 24 Prince before its discovered! This cozy neighborhood restaurant was a definite find
From the moment you enter you're greeted with friendly service - finally a cool new NY place without the pretentious hostess! Best part- the food! I don't know where they found this chef, but they have a winner
The menu is diverse which is great when you go out with that picky friend! We had the salmon and the bass and both dishes were unbelievably good
We couldn't pass trying their notable mac n cheese side dish
Wow! It was all so good, I had to try dessert, which I usually don't get
The berries and cream were wonderful
If you can request a seat, go for the banquet - it looks small, but you'll see how surprisingly comfortable it is and privacy is not lost
1st time @ 24 Prince for dinner - Food was great
Highly recommend: caesar salad, the pigs in the blanket and the mac cheese rolls-all delicious!  - I had no idea what wine to order, and the staff was great at making suggestions
We ordered several different wines by the glass! Ambiance: warm, social good looking people = potentional for meeting someone single and cute!   2nd time @ 24 Prince for dinner- GREAT date spot! Delicious food, cozy room friendly owners
Recommend: Downtown Chopped Salad, the Flatbread Pizza, Striped Bass and Fish Chips
The PBJ dessert was excellent! The food and service was great- I can't wait to visit the restaurant again
Oh- and the bathrooms are adorable! Dimly lit, with scented candles
Most importantly, CLEAN!
I have been waiting for a restaurant like this to open for awhile, and I have to say that 24 Prince has become my new go-to
It's the ideal spot to have an awesome meal in an intimate, friendly atmopshere
The menu offers such a fun variety, from the must have pigs n' blankets and rich mac cheese to the bbq chicken pizza and the downtown chopped salad
The real problem is deciding what to get! (Did I mention the pbj french toast-like dessert?) The brunch menu is just as amazing with the french toast with carmel and bananas and the eggs benedict on crab cakes
And if you judge a place by its bloody, this one rocks! I'm a HUGE fan of this newcomer
You can eat, drink, chill, whatever
I have now been to 24 Price 3 times - most recently for brunch - and it continues to impress
From the mouthwatering french toast to the eggs benedict to the crab meat stuffed omelet, my girlfriend and I ate our way through one of the most amazing Sunday brunches we ever had
The comfortable setting and warm abiance and welcoming service work fantastically well for a meal at any time of the day - whether brunch, an early dinner or a late night snack - all of which I have experienced and thoroughly enjoyed
This place is a reliable gem and will certainly be a huge hit
Finally got a chance to try out this place tonight and was pleasantly surprised by the cosy interior and excellent comfort food! The soup of the day, a mushroom concoction was way too salty
However, who would have thought mac and cheese spring rolls with gouda cheese could be so successfully light?! The fried chicken paired with mashed potatoes and spinach was tender juicy
Ah, and the peanut butter and jelly ice cream sandwich to die for! Very creative!
A few friends and I were downtown looking for a bite to eat and I think we stumbled upon a restaurant that will become a staple in our neighborhood dining
After noticing this newcomer on the block, we took a look inside and were intriqued by the cozy interior that just screamed out comfort
The food far exceeded the ambience after all four of us could not stop raving about the crispy mac and cheese rolls, pigs in a blanket and the barbecue pizza flatbread
But if we had known how good the entrees would be we might have went a little easier on the appetizers however, looking back Im not so sure thats gonna be possible
The meatloaf, fried chicken, risotto and mac and cheese got rave reviews around the table while the service could not have been more seemless
Just like homecooking
Kudos to this welcomed newcomer!
The doors have just opened and my husband and i had a wonderful dinner at this comfortable and extremely friendly establishment
The food was wonderful- pigs in a blanket, fried chicken, and the mac and cheese are must tries! We were also sent a peanut butter and jelly ice cream sandwich for dessert that i will have to have again

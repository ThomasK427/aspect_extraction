This little restaurant has great food atmosphere! it small initmate for a date or a small dining group
I only go during the weekends for brunch
This doesnt require reservations and you can have your choice in seats
FYI, the left side of the cooking bar gets a little smokey, as does the left side of the restaurant for the same reason
entertaining to watch the chef put your food together
Tapas can add up quickly, but a well worth the experience
I loved the tapas - the grilled octopus was great
Unfortunately, the service was horrible
We initially sat down as a couple and needed to ask for another seat when another friend came - the staff spent more time making sure the tables and chairs were exactly in a particular position than ensuring that we were enjoying our food
At one point a party of six people came in to eat and one of the diners was severely obese
Our waiter joked with another waiter and pointed at the man trying to get into the inside seat
It was embarrassing to see - In addition, our waiter was rude and rushed us
I love Mario batali restaurants (especially Otto's) and loved the food here but it would take a lot to get me to come back
This place is great
3 people - 8-10 tapas plates
Every single one was a homerun
Sitting and watching the food being cooked made it that much better
Don't like eating at cramped tight spaces, but it made the experience more personal
Had to wait for about 1 hour which was great because we were sent around the corner to Bar Jamon
Another GREAT experience
My wife and I went to Casa Mono on a random Monday and it was packed but we had a reservation so we were lucky
Although it was a tight squeeze were nestled in a spot between two tables and were none the wiser of the hustle and bustle surrounding us
Our waiter was great and very helpful with food selections and appropriate wine choices
Even though I am not a tapas fan, I recommend Casa Mono highly
Enjoy the food and atmosphere
I love the food at Casa Mono, although the lady at the door is consistenly rude
She acts as though we are invading her home
She is the first person you see and the last person you see and it not a pleasant sight
It is quite unfortunate because the food is so good and it is a fun place to hang out
This restaurant serves great tapas
The skirt steak and mussels were fabulous
I sat at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed watching the food get cooked right in front of me
I would definitely come back but I will be sure to come early as there are very few tables/seats in this place and it can get crowded very quickly! I might also bring a Spanish dictionary because I could barely read what was on the menu and there were no descriptions provided
i had a terrible experience at casa mono
waited for 55 minutes for a confirmed reservation
then we asked for 2 additional chairs for some friends that joined us and they didn t allow them to stay although the room, at that time, was empty
the food was below average
this place is just great
we sat at the bar, and the bartender beth was extremely knowledgeable and helpful
she helped us pick the perfect wines and the tapas were outstanding
from the skirt steak to the more unusual cornish hen and musseld with chorizo, everything was excellent
people talk about the price, but it really wasn't that bad
you pay for what you get, if you want cheap go to mcdonalds
if you want a great experience in a cozy little spot, this is it
Don't let the negative reviews put you off
This place is great for a late bite and a glass of wine if you're in the neighborhood (Union Square)
We stopped in several times while staying at the W Hotel after an evening of listening to music
Try the Mono Sundae for dessert
delish!
although getting a reservation is tough because of how small the place is, it's worth it
the plates are refined, the wine is out of this world
and the place is so cozy! definitely go
Mario Batali must be paying off the food critics in this town
How else could this place show up on Cheap Eats lists? It's a pricey little joint
Wines are only served by the quartino - which equals a glass and a quarter to restaurants (so they say), but is really only the equivalent of one glass that you'd get in a bar - and start at $10, and move up uncomfortably from there
Food is fine
I prefer the old quail preparation to the new one which is far too sweet
Won't return because it's too annoying to try to get a reservation
You can certainly eat just as well (and cheaper) elsewhere
Casa Mono serves interesting dishes (some hit, some miss), and the wine list offers a vast selection that may introduce you to something new
The space is too cramped though, and truth be told, I could never love this place because I'm biased
I live around the corner and I miss the unpretentious and always lovely, Irving on Irving, that used to occupy this space where you didn't need a reservation three weeks in advance to eat dinner after 5:30 and before 11 pm
Mario Batali is just too big a name to have such a small space and I miss my neighborhood place where you could simply 'drop in' for a great piece of fish and nice glass of wine with a friend or date
Irving on Irving has been gone for two years and I'm still smarting over it
I should really get over it
We really enjoyed the food, can't remember what we had, but it was all tasty
It's not a place to stuff yourself, but we felt great leaving satisfied (and no where near overly stuffed)
The duck was great, as was the quail
The waiter was a bit snobby though
Great for a date or any stage of the relationship
Good for new relationships too
General crowds were in the mid 30's
I noticed alot of previous reviews aren't to high, but i personally think the place was worth the visit
had a very ok dining experience
the room is very tight
I felt like I was eating in first grade where you have your little desk
the dishes are ok
Seems people like it though
I was still starving after 8 dishes
Casa Mono could be great, but it's not
Why? Because it lacks simplicity
The best dishes had only one or two ingredients like the Serrano ham or the pumpkin and goat cheese fritters
However, many of the dishes suffered from overkill
Pork loin was smothered with a too sweet quince compote
Duck was chewy and the skin lacked crunch and again, too much sweet cranberry jam
Even the fried potatoes, which would have great by themselves, were smothered with a vinegary onion relish that overpowered the potatoes
If Casa Mono can tone it down a couple notches and just focus on quality ingredients, it will be world class
Wine selection was excellent
I discovered two Spanish varietals Id never tried before and they were amazing
I liked the ambience of this small corner restaurant
Food was good with an interesting mix of various meats, vegetables and fruits - my only qualm was a bit too much salt on all our dishes
The best dish out of our 3 mains: quail with figs (also had the rabbit chicken), I suggest ordering a few plates to share as one would normally do with tapas
Ambience food recommended, lose a few points for too much salt
The food here was very good - and we sampled quite a bit of it along with the wonderful Spanish wines - but the service
it ruined the whole experience for me and my date
The hostess was so rude - and was CLEARLY ready for us to leave
The best past was the wild boar - and the mini squid with white beans was delicious
We ordered quite a bit of food - and each possible course - yet they still acted as though we asked for glasses of tap water
The waiter was so snobby - and not accomodating
One word of caution, the cantaloupe sorbet we ordered for dessert was disgusting - and they refused to take it off of the bill

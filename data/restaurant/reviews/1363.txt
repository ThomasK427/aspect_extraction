What a great place
I have never imagined that on this block, which is well known for all trendy night places, would I be able to spend such a quality time with my friends in a very relaxed atmosphere complemented by wonderful food and drinks
As soon as we arrived we were welcomed by a very courteous host who seated us promptly, although the place looked packed
Things only kept on getting better, from tasty appetizers and great wines, onto great food and very relaxed service
We never felt neither rushed nor ignored, it seemed like they knew exactly when to come and service us
We were a party of six and I had tried almost everything that was on the table, and had I been rich I would have hired the chef to cook only for me! All of my friends felt the same
Go eat at Naima!
Another excellent evening at Naima reveals the arrive of a New Chef from Italy
I came out on the dining room greetings clients and stop by our table reccomending an extraordinary Lamb dish Scottadito and a side of simply made roasted Potatoes
he then told my husband : Is very good eat it !
and it really was
I wish sometimes many other Restaurant were able to do the same,but we all know it is not possible
Def consider the Gem of 27th street seen
Bravo Again !
Pretty good food, but AWFUL service
There were staff running around everywhere, but not one stopped at our table to take our orders or bring out food - only to dump other people's dirty plates on the end of our table - they were too busy drinking at the bar
Shame because the food was good, although not fantastic
Good ambiance if you don't mind the music climbing in volume progressively over the evening to the point of not being able to hear your neighbor speak
Clever decor with lower false ceiling to distinguish the bar area
I must admit that there are not too many restaurants in this area
but if you make the trek to Naima i don't think you will be disapointed
The menu has a variety of dishes all seem to be above average in quailty
The open space is designed very nicely and the staff seems to know what they are doing
I would def
go back there again especially if I was going out to one of the clubs near by
This restaurant did not live up to expectations
The server was rude, the service was slow, and the food was unimaginative and bland
We were sat at an unsatisfactory table in the back and although the restaurant was empty they said that they could not move us because all of the other tables had been pre-reserved
I could have cooked a better meal at home and I am in no way a cook
While the staff at this restaurant are extremely friendly, the service is painfully slow
I dined there on a Wednesday night, the restaurant was practically empty, and we had to ask our waiter for everything, the menu, more water, the check, etc
I ordered the Lobster fettucini, which was bland and had only one small piece of lobster in it
There are numerous other restaurants to try before going to this one
The place has a very cool atmosphere but the service is slow, the food not that great and overpriced and the wine list is too pricy
I've had meals for much less that were so much better
Had the chicken as my main dish and found it to be dry with really no flavor
There are tons of great places in the city that are way better
I went to Naima for the first time tongiht with 3 girlfriends, and it was an excellent meal! The food is simple yet bursting with wonderful flavors without being pretentious or overpriced! The service is good, the atmosphere is great for both romantic couples or small or large groups
This is by far one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while in NY!
Ever since this little italian restaurant openned I became their frequent visitor
Finnaly, there came a restaurant with everything included (great food, great service (ladies, they are also very cute, especially the owner!) and a wonderful ambience)
I found it a great pleace to come to before hitting clubs for either food or drinks
I had dinner here last night before hitting the neighborhood clubs
We had a reservation and the seating was prompt
This place must be new they scored with the great location
The place was lively and filled with beautiful faces
On one of the first chilly nights it was great to warm up with a glass of wine and the mouthwatering salmon
Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive
This is the perfect spot to meet up with friends and have a drink at the bar or stay a while and enjoy the scene and savor the food
Lucky Burger is on my way home from work
I was familiar with it from it's sister location in the Lower East Side
Now, in all fairness to those who wrote before
when I first visited Lucky Burger, when it initially opened, they seemed somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of customers they were obviously getting
it was slightly chaotic for my taste
However, I returned recently and have found my new addiction! Seriously
It is really fantastic
Quick, affordable, delicious
and they offer these great milkshakes
I highly recommend this place
ITS JUST REALLY FUN
The decor is adorable, they have TVs to hang out and watch while you are getting your burger, and the fries have always been hot (dont you hate cold fries?)! I have no vested interest in writing this, other than my friends are hoping they will continue the chain and open one by them
in Jersey
:)
waited for 40 mins and never got my food so I cnxld my order and got my $ back, good call based on my friends revues
One of them left half of his BBQ bacon cheese burger behind due to a funky taste
Go around the corner to island burger for a real burger!
Best Burgers On Earth
Hardly
New Lucky Burger in Midtown doesn't compare to some other joints around here
A great experience would be
Grab yourself a bag of onion rings and walk over to another famous Midtown Burger place
I came to lucky burger expecting a typical flashy place with just plain burgers
Boy was I wrong
The Burgers are exceptional, juicy and delicious
So many different kinds
The fries are old fashioned crinkle cuts and they were perfect
You gotta try the shakes! I had an orange creamsicle
Yum
Check it out!!
the quality of service at lucky burger is only topped by the quality of the burgers themselves
the milkshakes are amazing, and they seem to be forever adding new and tasty treats to their already expansive menu
delivery is FAST FAST FAST
if u're craving a lucky treat at 4 in the morn', u won't be disappointed, cuz they're still open
quality yumminess, whether u're a vegetaran or a serious meat lover
By far, the juiciest, tastiest burger I've ever had
the shakes are thick and delicious
I'm addicted!
Food not that good Service not that bright Price not that fair Ambience not that unique The drinks were good Panda Express is comparable
I was excited to try this place because it looked cozy from the outside
I stood in the doorway for over 10 mins while the staff watched me before some guy finally seated me the restaurant wasn't busy
The mandu was typical, just packaged differently, but nothing extraordinary in taste
The martini I drank was so weak sweet I couldn't drink it my entree was brought to me luke warm
I asked the server if he could heat it up he told me they don't use microwaves--wich is good cause it means the food is fresh, but it could also mean he was too lazy to take the food back to the kitchen
Overall, I would NEVER go there again
the people food were so impersonable
Quite simply
*food is delicious and creatively prepared - a unique menu in all the neighborhood *the owners and staff are warm and friendly *the space itself feels good - good lighting, adequate space at your table, etc *drinks - soju, which is a kind of korean sake, is worth trying, plus they've got some really unique Asian beers that you should ask about (our favorite is called Halida, a Vietnamese beer)  Another thing that is different about Soju
the owners, Joe and Diane (who are simply two of the nicest people we have met in the entire city) live in and have roots in this neighborhood
They didn't open the place to cash in on the Brooklyn thing
As a result, Soju retains a homey feel

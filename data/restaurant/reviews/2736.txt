We only saw 2 - 3 boring appitizers on the menu and not a lot of choices of meat to select from
Service was definitely not friendly we felt we were rushed out
This is the best steak you will ever have, hands down
If you don't believe me, ask Zagat or Gourment magazine, who rate it as #1
For all of the reviewers who give it a 2 or 3 or God forbid a 1, go back to Outback Steakhouse so I can get a reservation more easily
Beautiful meat, perfectly cooked
Tell me how many other places you can go where you can cut your porterhouse with a fork
And about the ambiance-- it's a classic steakhouse with no froufrou, as it should be
I've eaten at a long list of Top Ten Steakhouses over the past 25 years, and nothing can touch the steak you get here--this is the benchmark
The perfectly aged atmosphere is just a bonus to the perfectly aged steak
Make mine tomatoes and onions, steak for two, hash browns, creamed spinach, and schlag
People who complain about anything Luger-related are clearly ill-informed dilettantes
I went there with my friend from out of town, I had never been and was expecting to impress with the best of nyc, I was unimpressed and so was everyone else, the steak is good for what it is, which is homestyle bbq porterhouse, don't expect anything gourmet, nothing fantastic or out of this world, just a big plate of charred meat, tasty, but nothing great, and defiantly not worth the 98 bucks you paid for it
I went to Peter Luger b/c I love steak and b/c I heard that Peter Luger is the best steakhouse in New York
I have to say that I was not that impressed
I felt that the menu was too limited and that the starters and the sides were only so so
The steak itself was prepared to perfection and tasted fabulous
The atmosphere was fun, but be prepared to wait for a table even with a reservation and this is in no way a leisurely and comfortable place to dine
I will probably not go back any time soon b/c I feel you can great steak at so many places in the city
The bottom line is that the steak is great, but that's about it
You get what you pay for
a truly memorable delicious meal
If you're a steak lover, you must go
No need to see the menu
Bring your appetite cash
no credit cards accepted
Enjoy
This over-hyped steak house is nothing great
What's so great about their steak? I think I can do better at home, really
The best description for this restaurant for me is one of those restaurants you visit as a tourist because of its popularity but really doesn't meet your standards
Don't get me wrong, it's not horrific to the point that it's not edible, but it's not worth the hype nor price
Peter Luger's is simply the best steak in NYC
A meal you will be sure to remember FOREVER
Truely amazing
BEST STEAK I EVER HAD, WORST WAITERS I EVER HAD
EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT ONCE, IN MOST CASES THAT'S ENOUGH
True, rule # 1 is never ever ask for a menu
It's as good as writing rookie across your forhead
The trick to the tomato and onions is ask for it light on the onions, heavy on the tomatoes, order steak for one less person than you have in your party and if the steak is too rare, you can cook the individual pieces more by placing them on the platter around the edges
The food is OK but very overpriced
The waiters are miserable
Im a steakoholic, Im proud of this fact and Im sure Ill never change
I was given the chance to go to Peter Lugar on my birthday last year and it was simply the best steak Ive ever had! There have been close seconds, and even a few that hyped up their creations to be the equal of Peter Lugar, but nothing comes close
Sure there was little there for the vegetarian in my party, but we did not go there for salad! Simply the best steaks!
Rule #1: Don't look at the menu
Steak for (#), creamed spinach, hashbrowns
Failure to comply will result in an impatient waiter
They're mostly older men who have been doing this job for 40 years
Rule #2: They don't use a George Forman Grill or meat from Stop N' Shop
They prepare it their way
Aged beef charred on the outside, red on the inside
It seals the juices in and is mouthwatering
This is how it is
I like that you can dress down
If you're going to make the trek out to Nowheresville, Brooklyn and pay those prices it's nice to know you can wear a tee-shirt and jeans
the best steak in the world if i dont go here i dont eat steak!!!!
sorry, but i still can't figure out why this place is rated so high every year
the appetizers were great
the bacon slices were original
you only get one choice of steak and that's a greasy porterhouse that's charred black on the outside and rare on the inside
for my money, i'll take the palm, angelo/maxie, sparks, or smith and wolly any day
I've read a lot of reviews about Peter Luger's that says their steak tastes like butter
1st off I like butter on steaks but I don't want the actual steak to taste like butter! I want it to taste like aged, cooked cow! If I wanted butter, I'd grab the Land O Lakes out of my fridge and start spooning it up
This is the best steak hands down
I love going to Brooklyn, it is like going in a time machine 60 years ago
True the steaks were delicious
A bit undercooked for my tastes (medium had bloody centers) but delicious nonetheless
Creamed spinach was perfect and hash browns were hearty and savory
But the tomato and onion salad is actually huge slabs of onion with an equally huge slab of tomato
after the first couple of bites, the onion really ties your stomach into knots
I would pass on the tomato/onion salad next time
Also, got crappy corner table where waiters kept bumping into us
But at least he was relatively friendly
A bit out of the way but serves great steaks - well aged, tender and full of flavor
Service is ok
Book reservations well in advance, and you will be rewarded
Don't even think about doing a walk in
There are quirks which should be aware of
It is a limited menu, but you are there for the Porterhouse
For some reason waiters don't like to hand out menus, and you are treated much better if you can order from memory
Just in case you've never been there before: Green salad w/bleu cheese, smoked bacon strips 3-4 per person (often forgotten, but worth the experience), Porterhouse (hint, order a porterhouse for 3, for every 2 people
Trust me), hash browns, creamed spinach
By ordring the bacon strips it show that you really know what you are doing
Go light on the bread, and you might even be able to fit dessert
Stick with the Beck's Dark or hard spirits
Don't embarrass yourself by ordering something like a Long Island Ice T
Oustanding! Tastes, service and ambience
A steak house worthy of the cow's life
Where's the Kobe?
I don't believe that there is anyone living in the New York area or who has ever visited Peter Luger's steak house that doesn't salavate remembering the last time they were there
I had the Porterhouse
The steak literally was the size of the table
It took two waiters to lift it and place it
The rest of my group had to be reseated at an adjacent table
The steak was done properly, the medium was slightly cool in the middle
The was very little if any seasoning on the meat, and the outsiside has nice sear marks and a rich taste
Try cutting the outside and eating it seperately from the inside
The steak was also very very tender
I did not need a knife to cut it as the fork was able to penetrate all the way through the pink center as vital juices ozzed all over the place
When I was finished about a dozen bus boys converged and cleaned everything up

Seems a bit large for the NYC scene where tight tables are the norm- but was a great lunch experience
The clam chowder and iceberg wedge salad were delicious and fresh
The fish and steaks were also noteworthy
And for me, great steak houses are set apart by great dessert- the cheese cake here is absolutely worth saving room for
it's a business man's restaurant
nyc's corporate world converges here after hours
pricy excellent food, friendly service
it was a great experience, nothing about it was disappointing
Probably the best steak I have had in a long time and definetly the best entire meal I've had
The Crab Cake appetizers were so good, the Filet was out of this world, so juicy and tastful, and the onion rings were awesome! The waitress was the best and although expensive, defintely worth it
I am going back this week!
Wow - this was a great steak, and overall experience
The onion rings are the size of doughnuts! Service was impeccable
Nice atmosphere- a little more classy than your typical steakhouse
Would go back any day!!
We had first tried this restaurant in Dallas last summer and what a fabulous meal! To our surprise we learned of this location in Manhattan
It definatelyblows Peter Luger's and Morton's away
Try the crab cake appitizer, scrumptous! I always get the Rib Eye steak, even though its fatty, but it melts in your mouth! My husband usually gets the Porterhouse
Whatever you order, you won't be dissappointed! (Try the butterscotch cheesecake for dessert! :)
Just perfect
Service was impeccable, steak was amazing
Only complaint was that the $9 garden salad was just like it was out of Dole salad bag
Should have had a nice dinner salad at such a great place
Chateau Potatoes were delish!
I was talked into ordering the porterhouse and I conseqeuntly spent more $ than I had intended
Good Move
Del Frisco's Steak = Basass meal I wanted to go for the prix fixe restaurant week menu, but that didn't work out
Whatever
Del Frisco's is pricey and I was seated in a leper locker room area, but the food was totally fantastic
The food was very very very good! One little thing - we had to send two plates back because 1) the steak was too rear and 2) salmon was not cooked at all
Other than that, it was very delicios
I love this place, better then Lugers or Ruth Chris, the steak was incredible but make sure you bring cash, this aint cheap, the setting was nice too, good date place
With Steakhouses popping up all over Manhattan it's nice to see one of such quality survive
I was skeptical when I heard Del Frisco's was part a southwestren chain but I was pleasantly surprised but the food, quality and attention to detail
Unique shrimp cocktails and melt in your mouth Filet Mignons are a must
#1 steack house in Manhattan, filet mignon is like butter, unbelievable service !!!!!
eventhough everything is expensive, the food is out of this world
better than one can imagine
the staff there is amazing, and very helpful
also very accomodating for large groups of peoples as well
The meals can get expensive especially if you get a bottle of wine, desert and some sides, but you have to try the crab cakes and shrimp cocktails
AMAZING
This is definitely a good restaurant
It is not the best steak I have eaten, however the ambience, appetizers, and dessert make up for it
The wait staff is attentive, however they sometimes forget to bring things to your table
Appetizers are great
The stone crab claws and the shrimp are excellent
The steak is a little overseasoned
A great steak does not need this much seasoning, and this is coming from a person who loves flavorful and spicy food
Great wine list
This place is a cognac drinkers dream! They have it all
Hands down this is the best Creme Brulee in Manhattan
Very pleasurable dinner before a show
The dinner special (34
95) comes with an abundance of food for the average appetite
The steak and the trimmings were very flavorable
among the best steaks I have had
Great service, nice street level view, and clean restrooms (for the connoisseur!) Carolann, who I believe is the manager, was very nice and attentive to the needs of our satisfaction
Definitely would go again
I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary a few years ago
and we had the best steak dinners of our lives
so now we return here each year on our anniversary, and whenever else we have the chance
The staff at Del Friso's is very professional and make the dining experience an extreme pleasure
I highly recommend this place to anyone who would enjoy great steak at an exceptional restaurant
Del Frisco's continues its unrivaled excellence in serving the best steaks in town
This also goes for the superior service and the uncanny knowledge of the menu the wait staff bring to the table
One of the premier wine list in the New York City area
But remember to bring your wallet! A must dining experience
Del Frisco's is truly the best SteakHouse in New York
I have tried all the best in New York and nothing compares overall to this place
The steaks are alwasy done the way asked
The room is just stunning
The appetizers and side dishes are not overly creative but really please the tastebuds
Portions are very large
If you have room for dessert, they are consistant as well
Wonderful for business dinners or to impress out of towners
Probably the best SteakHouse in the city and BEST bet for a Pre-Theatre Meal!
We enjoyed this steak house immensely
The lobster was a treat and the atmosphere was perfect
Don't forget the cheesecake!
Great Service, Great Steaks, Great Sides
Best Creamed Spinach Around
Skillet Potatoes and Shrimp Appetizers Are Both Amazing
Looks Like A Power Scene Without The Power People
Ludicrously expensive, but excellent, well-seasoned steak, the best in the city (yes, that includes Peter Luger's)
It can be a bit expensive and pretentious (bring your credit card
s) but is worth it
After going exclusively for drinks for over two years we had dinner at this (and the Dallas) Del Frisco's and the food was outstanding
A wonderful place
even though it is owned by the Lone Star chain
Not enough can be said about how wonderful this place is
Friendly and helpful staff start the experience off the right way
Then comes the food---very expensive but well worth it
The steak was cooked exactly to order, the huge lobster tail was so tender and sweet it barely needed the drawn butter
All the sides were great, wine list impressive and dessert to die for
The only thing missing was a bigger stomach to eat more of this wonderful food
When you want a piece of beef, head on over
Tasty steak, pork loin, the works
Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable
And I could do without the cigar smoke

It is such a cool find
I saw it in Time Out last week and came with my friends
They had an art show and auction going on when we went, so we had dinner and then stayed for a few drinks and listened to Gruv Gallery after that
The menu had a pretty great selection--I ordered the tuna and it was so delicious! The service was great from the waitstaff, to the bartender to the dj's
Even the owner checked in to see if we were having a nice time
I would recomend this place for dinner or to chill out at for drinks
Viva La Vuelta
My coworker had been telling me she read about it in the NY post, so we checked it out last week and it was great! The food was really yummy and affordable (love quesadilas and argentina steak), and the music the djs were playing was AWESOME, definetely best salsa i have heard in a long time! They have this nice backyard with cool artwork throughout the restaurant and in the back, and you can dance if you want to!
Latin or not if you want to add a lil' Spice to your Rice La Vuelta is a great place to go out for some good food drinks
I have been to La Vuelta many times on my lunch hour
A couple of weekends ago, I had made a suggestion to a group of friends that I knew of a great place to grab something to eat have a couple of drinks - THEY LOVED IT
We usually make Friday Night an Early Night but we were in no rush to leave
The service was good, the music was right and the food drinks were awesome
I went for lunch the tuna salad was great and the service was prompt
After my lunch experience I decided to return for dinner on a Friday night and discovered a diamond in the ruff! The atmosphere was great; they actually had a D
J
that played some great music
This really complimented the food and my dining experience
Dinner, dancing and a great atmosphere you can't get any better
I recommend Friday nights
My fiance and I love this little bistro
The atmosphere is wonderful--its romantic, cozy and trendy at the same time- the menu has a wide selection of latin dishes that are just too yummy!! Try the chorizo!! The prices are reasonable too and the service is great
I recommend la vuelta to everyone I know
We go on friday nights because they feature great dj's too!!
A couple of co-workers and I ate here for lunch
The inside is a warm environment, but their outside garden could use some work
The sangria was watered down and we waited an hour for our food
Once the food came, it was actually very good
I hope it wasn't my stomach just relaying this message to my brain b/c I was very hungry
I don't think so
I enjoyed the food and would go back
Go after 1 p
m
when it's not too crowded
We went here for valentine's day dinner and it was great
The atmosphere is very cozy and relaxed, we were not rushed at all
We could have sat there all night, the waiter was polite and knowledgeable and the food was fabulous
The drinks were great, try the brazilian capriana
We will definately go back!
This is a hidden, cozy little place
The food and drinks are great
The outside doesn't say anything but go in and try it you will love it
Great for couples
The food is excellent and the atmosphere is great
The other reviewers were right, it really is a nice date place and is very comfortable
They also have great dj's that play world music on friday nights and interesting artwork on the walls
I would highly recomend this place
Try the chorizo for an appetizer, it was really good
I have been to La Vuelta a couple of times and have enjoy the food, wine and the attentive service
It's a charming, tasty and affordable
IF you get a chance check it out
This place has been around for a few years
The food is great (big selection, reasonable prices) and the drinks are really good
Try the Mojito! Its a great place to take a date, especially on friday nights when the dj is playing
The atmosphere is warm, comfortable, artsy and sexy
Overall, a nice place to dine, chill and relax
La Vuelta is a hidden gem
I was there again with my boyfriend a few days ago, and I loved it
I ordered the skirt steak which was amazing
I love the atmosphere, particularly the art work on the walls and the latin/world music on friday nights (they have an excellent dj on Friday nights)
The place has alot of energy, but its cozy too
The staff is friendly and they all have personality
It's one of my favorite little spots!
La Vuelta is the perfect little neightborhood bistro
I only wish it were in my neighborhood! Although I live in NJ, I often come here when visiting friends in Queens as the food is SO delicious and inexpensive
well worth the price, as well as the drive
The Sangria, the empanadas
the skirt steak
YUM! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! And the outdoor area in the back is great when the weather is nice :)
A great find in an out of the ordinary neighborhood
Around for a few years with consistently good food
The menu gets better and better
A great garden in the summer full bar nice wine list
This place is incredible
The food is absolutely wonderful and the owner cooks all of the food himself
The two guys that work there are just plain old nice guys
It's not cheap and it does take a long time if the place has a good number of people in it, but the food is well worth the wait
We go here any time we are looking for something out of the ordinary
This place is amazing
I went for my birthday dinner, after doing quite a bit of online research looking for some middle eastern food
This place did not disappoint
The service was exceptional, and the food was as well
We ordered a mixed appetizer and I ordered the lamb entree
My boyfriend ordered the rabbit, which he wasn't as excited about
My food was perfect
I couldn't have asked for a better experience
I would go again and again and recommend it to anyone
Definitley a hidden gem in NYC!
I live in the neighborhood and have been here several times
I don't recommend the tasting menu or going when it's very crowded on weekend nights
The chef is marvelous and the food is outstanding
Try going during the week and you won't be disappointed
After reading the reviews, I was excited to visit
Big mistake! From the moment I got there, they had no ice for the almost warm bottled spring water they served me
I ordered the $30 price per person fix menu and I got very little in return
This includes 1 appetizer, and 3 main courses
Sounds like alot, huh? Wrong! The portions were so tiny, even a child would be hungry still, the ambience, well, there was none, very grimey, dark, hot (no a/c), steamy smokey from the kitchen
The food was very plain (I was looking for the salt but didn't want to insult the cook)
The service was lacking as it took 30-45mins
per dish to be served

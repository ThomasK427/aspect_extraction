We were seated promptly and I drank while friends ate
The second time was around 8pm, the usual dinner rush time and we had to leave because the place was too packed
The third time we expected the long wait and when were were finally seated (25 mins later) it was defintely worth the wait
The food was excellent and the environment was fun
A great place to see and be scene if that 's what you're looking for
Nothing out of the ordinary for a new hip and reasonably priced restaurant!
What's with the negative reviews below? Yes, there is a wait, it's a hotspot
Yes, the tables are crowded together, it's a hotspot
Yes, it's noisy as hell, it's a HOTSPOT
Worth it, though, for delicous food, great scene, cool music and a fun vibe
Have a glass of wine at the bar and relax
You'll get seated eventually
Avoid this place at all costs
A waste of time and money
Waited almost over almost an hour for our meal to arrive, the waitress was rude, when she decided to grace the table with her presence every half hour or so
The food, when it finally arrived was tasted luke-warm and stale
Never going back
I have to disagree with the review about the bar
Maybe it's the night I went, but the drinks were very watered down and the bartender was extremely slow
I also had the same reaction about being hurried out
I used to live in Europe and love the way that you can linger for two hours over a cup of coffee
Not this place! My wife and I had already finished dinner, and were thinking about dessert, when the waiter came over and brought the bill and say Are you ready to pay?
We were about to order dessert
No way after that! Also, the wine selection was very haphazard and the bottle we selected was corked
I had high hopes for the place, but don't waste your time
In a place like NYC, there are a hundred better choices within 5 blocks
Where to start? We were the first table to arrive but were squeezed in at a table right in front of the door -- they wouldn't move us, even though we asked
The restaurant got a beverage delivery around 6:45 -- they wheeled it right past the diners
The waiter harassed us to order despite our saying we weren't ready -- and he wouldn't accept our appetizer order until we ordered entrees
And, the food wasn't particularly great
I've read rave reviews of the mac and cheese -- but it was flavorless
The only thing that truly was tasty was the artichoke dip
When we asked for another cup of coffee, the waiter was quick to whisk away the bill and return with a new one (adding the cost of the refill), but we then had to wait almost 10 minutes for the cup of coffee
Don't waste your time
I had an enjoyable meal one Monday evening with about 20 people, ordering a three course meal, mixed drinks and many bottles of wine
So you can imagine our dismay when we were KICKED OUT because a reservation that HADN'T SHOWN UP was supposedly on its way
No, we weren't kicked out for being loud and obnoxious
After spending a few thousand dollars, we were kicked out for apparently overstaying our welcome
I will never go here again despite the fact that I enjoyed all other aspects of the restaurant
Not a good choice if you want to want to spend a long evening wining and dining
I hear they no longer accept reservations
Imagine that
This place used to be good and now it's kind of a joke
They've had more makeovers than Tammy Fae, and it's super expensive for both the area and what you get
I still eat here every now and then but it ain't nothing to travel for
Great place the food is out of this world
And might bump heads with some hot celebreties especially if you like basketball players or boxers
I love it
LOVE LOVE this place
The food is great
I recommend the chicken ricardo
The service is VERY FAST
Valet parking
The mojitos are wonderful :-) i've become a regular
I've had the same steak at Peter Lugers for double the price
The staff is extremely friendly and the kitchen does a magnificent job! The chef is truely talented and she makes you want to come back time and time again
If you are looking for a great meal at a great price in a cozy atmoshere, this is the place to go
The steak is out of this world, Mohitos are yummy and to top it off they have a heated outdoor patio to puff on a cig! It's a smokers paradise
The staff is really nice and they also have valet parking which is a ++++ for those who drive
Service here is extemely slow, so get your order ready right away
Especially if ou order steak
Everything thing is great
Very friendly staff
In Short An assembly line of staffers in this slender, well-lit storefront keep the cream puffs rolling into eager customers' hands
The puffs, made with 2 layers: The first is choux pastry, which is the pastry that's used in eclairs and profiteroles; the second layer is pie pastry
The puffs are filled to-order with a whipped cream-custard mixture
The puffs are best when eaten straight-away, but they can be refrigerated and eaten later
I am not much of a sweets person, but the moment I bit into a near baseball sized $1
25 cream puff, I was instantly hooked
There isn't much to explain other than the puffs are well prepared, creamy but not overwhelming, and extremely tasty
I've always experienced great service visiting this Beard Papa Sweets location
It serves as a great cheap dessert option for the NYU students in the area and makes a great takeout treat for after meal celebration
I heard about this place from an article in the newspaper and decided to try it
These are the best cream puffs around
They are fresh and not too sweet which is what I loved the most
I have only tried the vanilla cream but i will return to try some of the other daily flavors
They are big and worth the price
i just hope they keep their quality and prices the same
After hearing my co-worker rave about them I decided to try them for myself
My first was the regular Vanilla cream
After one bite I was in LOVE! They're so yummy! I ended up getting a dozen before I left the store
When I introduced these puffs to my friends, they all were too full from dinner to eat one, but after having one, they all HAD to have another
The cream-puffs are light, fluffy and not overly sweet
They make the cream-puffs fresh when you order
They come in a variety of flavors; vanilla bean, with daily special flavors like green tea, chocolate, eclair
They range from $1
25 to $1
75 each, but are worth every penny
The only downside to this story
the daily special flavors are limited
They make a certain amount of the special flavor filling and once its done, you're out of luck for the day
EXCELLENT cream puffs
crunchy and soft shell, with a heavenly vanilla cream inside (not too sweet or thick like some other custards)
Puffs are freshly made every 30 min
so you know you'll be getting some good stuff
Store was really cute and waitstaff very friendly
Try their eclair or daily flavors as well (green tea was pretty good too!)
for 1
25$ i couldn't spend my money better
I have not taken a single person here that disliked beard papa's amazing cream puffs

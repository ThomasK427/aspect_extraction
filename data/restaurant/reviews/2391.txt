If you are lucky, you will see a lot of high profiles
I usually don't write reviews, but when I saw 8
9 score, I felt like I had to say something
This place is arguably the best Japanese restaurant in New York
40 years in business can't be wrong
The most remarkable thing is the consistency; I have dined at the restaurant so many times over 15 years and I have never been disappointed by the food they served nor the service
Quick note: Make sure you have clean socks on if you want to use the private tatami room!
Having been to Japan many times and having had some of the world's finest sushi and Japanese cuisine, it's hard to find a good Japanese restaurant in NY
Nippon is one of the rare outstanding exceptions
The food is authentic and amazing
Their home grown soba noodle is easily the best in NY, no comparison
Looking forward to going their again in the near future!!!
The Scene Bouterin could easily pass for a florist shop, as the foyer is abloom with splays of daisies, peonies, colorful wildflowers and dried herb bouquets
The main dining room is equally evocative, adorned with antique cupboards, country tiles and farmhouse tables
Service is discreet, attentive and eager to please
The Food Chef/owner Antoine Bouterin made his mark in the '80s at the sumptuous Le Perigord, bringing authentic Provencal fare to a city weaned on traditional Lyonnaise cuisine
Expect to be seduced by signature dishes like pissaladiere, a sweet and herbaceous tomato and onion tart; Marseille-style fish soup, an oceanic classic made with a tomato-based fish broth; and a fragrant osso buco studded with al dente vegetables
For dessert, go with the delicate fruit tarts or a sublime rendition of oeufs a la neige
We went here on a Friday night and were surprised to find it nearly empty
The reason became clear during our meal: the food just isn't very good
My fiancee ordered a steak which he rated a c+, and I ordered the only thing they could offer a vegetarian: steamed vegetables, which I rate a D-
I couldn't even finish my meal
The decorations are assorted dusty knick-knacks and sad dried flowers
On the upside, the service was very good, but for a $200 meal, I expect to enjoy the food
Thank you to Igor everyone for making this wedding rehearsal dinner a memorable one
The staff made us all feel so special and comfortable
The private room was perfect for our needs
The food was delicious, the flowers were absolutely gorgeous everywhere
I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for that personal attention which is hard to find in a big city like New York! We can't wait to go back!
We had our small wedding reception here in June, and we just loved it! Igor and Antoine did everything imaginable to make the planning as painless and accommodating as possible, and they treated my family so well that my father toasted Igor at the reception! The food was delicious, the service was excellent, the decor was lovely and just overflowed with fresh flowers
There's also a front patio that was tented for the cocktail hour which also served as the backup ceremony location in case of rain
The location was convenient and there's a parking facility next door (they gave us some problems, but the restaurant helped to sort it out)
The price for all of this was surprisingly reasonable
Thank you to everyone for everything, even after the wedding was over
I've been going to Bouterin for several years as it's  my favorite restaraunt in NY
It's well known for it's specialty in bridal Showers, weddings and corporate events--though I just love the A La Carte--the food and service in beyond superb and it's always interesting as the crowd varies---from the sophisticated Sutton Place cleintel ,to young, hip and trendy---just this month Bouterin redecorated the front part of the restaurant and it's now a lounge to have a cozy dinner or have a glass of wine to the sounds of Budda Bar or other chic music
the decor is rich in color and texture and so warm and comfortable I feel like I'm in Paris-- absolutely the greatest date venue in NY
they only seet about 12 in the lounge so it's intimate and private
I have been a customer at Bouterin several times as a result of attending a private party and one thing I have to say is absolutely delicious
At the party we were served a tasting menu of baked goat cheese on fennel, mushroom risotto, baby lamb chops, a sauted red snapper and followed by the most scrumptious and in my opinion a house specialty the lamb stew The desserts were scrumptious, especially the floating island and warm chocolate souffl
Within a week I had to return
I highly recommend this experience either for a party or dinner a la carte
The attentive service and authentic French country atmosphere makes the meal even more enjoyable!
Let me start by saying Igor (the lovely co-owner) did the most fantastic bridal shower for me
I felt like a princess the entire day
The service was terrific
The ambiance was breathtaking, I am still getting calls from family and friends who cannot stop raving about it
Second, on a return trip for dinner, we were met with a big hug and kiss from Igor
What a host! He's truely the best
After he sat us down we were served us the most delicious meal and tasty wines
We savored each bite
The service was perfect
We could have stayed all night and we can't wait to return

Rarely does fine dining remain in my memory bankLa Terrasse in Juan Le Pins, Yacout in Marrakech, and now an outstanding French provincial gem in Manhattan called Bouterin
The refined cuisine with its delectable tastes, comfortable ambience and highly personalized friendly service makes this a rare serendipitous delight
Having Igor cater a dinner party at my home replicated this superb culinary experience
Much appreciation to the owner/chefs Antoine and Igor for a job well done
I celebrated my most recent birthday at Bouterin and was elated and satisfied on every level which says a lot considering New York dining criterion which tends to be quite competitive
This fabulous evening included 25 friends who were welcomed at such a gorgeous table and each course more delicious then the next
The owners and staff were so attentive to every detail without pretense
rather simple elegance, warmth and follow through
The desserts were out of this world and the wine which accompanied each dish were completely in sync which is a metaphor to the entire operation of this tremendous restaurant
Needless to say I look forward to planning my corporate business holiday party at Bouterin as it is the perfect space to express appreciation for friends/family and larger events for business collegues
Thank you for your gracious service and a memory for my palate and heart!
This restaurant is fantastic! The service is always available and immediate but allows the patrons to enjoy their privacy
The wine is wonderful and the waiter always has great suggestions for the perfect wine to go with the meal
The meal
Oh the food is out of this world! I have been there 5 or 6 times and everytime it is a treat
I bring new friends with me everytime and they say it is the best food they have had in NYC ever! The owners are the nicest gentlemen you will ever meet
Always accommodating and VERY generous
I don't know anyone who can say anything ill about them or the restaurant
If they do, then they have problems not Bouterin
I went to Bouterin for the first time last weekend to celebrate my boyfrined's birthday and the environment was simply gorgeous and the service very attentive
It was a great place to enjoy the fruits of life- great food, great wine and a cozy environment to relax in and decompress from the hectic NYC life
It was wonderful to be in a place that is so uniquely decorated with french antigues and fresh flowers  (something different from all the generic NYC restaurants)
The Osso buco was delicious- tender and flavorful
I highly reccomend it for those who want a setting that is conducive to intimate conversation and those who are tired of the typical modern NYC restaurant decor
I had heard many wonderful things about his restaurant, and was looking for a place to book a party
I went there last night to check it out and as soon as I walked into the place I knew this was the perfect place for my party
The ambiance was absolutely gorgeous, and I was greeted by the most wonderful staff
The friendly matridee showed us around the beautiful dining room, and then we sat down with the owner who is by far one of the nicest most personable men I have done business with
After planning the party, he insisted on us sampling the food, which was so declicious
I had such a lovely experience at this place and would definitely recommend it for your next party or an intimate dinner for two
As the other review stated, the service here by the waiters is good, but the owners are horrible
We were planning a wedding and they gave us a free dinner to celebrate the contract
Unfortunately, we had to cancel the contract and they charged us for the dinner
Unbelievable! Do not go here, they are not nice people!
My boyfriend and I dined at this establishment on Valentine's Day
It was by far the worst dining experience either one of us have ever had
From beginning to end, the whole experience was utterly horrific
Words cannot adequately express how awful the service, food and ambiance were
I only hope that people read this review before dining at this atrocity
I have never been to a restaurant, especially on Valentine's Day, where every table is requesting to speak to a manager
Take my advice---don't go here!!!!!!

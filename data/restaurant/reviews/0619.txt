I leave pleased every time
went on a Monday night and there was a 40 minute wait so my girlfriend and i decided to eat at the bar instead
the restaurant is small
trendy but cute
the menu selection is limited but very interesting
if you like trying new things like we do, you'll be fine
i had the stripped bass appetizer
wasn't impressed
the bass was raw, which is fine b/c i love sushi but it didn't seem fresh
my girlfriend had the mussels
a little spicy but very good
for entree i had the pork medallion
excellent
my girlfriend got the goat cheese rigatoni
i was suprised to see that it came in a broth
i thought this was a weird combo but it was delicious
for dessert we had the espresso cheesecake and the poached pear
both good but nothing special
overall, the pre-fixe was a great value
definitely a restaurant to try at least once
It used to be a NYC bargain
Everytime I go back, it's more disappointing than the last time
Portions are getting smaller smaller and smaller that I don't think it's a bargain anymore
I think there are plenty of good restaurants in NYC that offer better values and services
I ordered portobello mushroom as a starter and there was one tiny portobello mushroom sliced in half with a few slices of tomatoes
Chicken dish used to be really good but its size has somehow shrunk to a size that I wasn't able to tell if i had ordered a main dish or appetizer
The food was ok but nothing special and therefore not worth the $25
The beet salad was huge but not particularly tasty
The tuna appetizer was so so
We had a bean pasta entree which was completely plain jane
The skate dish was descent but very salty
Desserts (tiramasu and chocolate mousse) were mediocre
Overall, there are other great restaurants that I could get a meal for $25 with much better food
Service was attentive though
Nice place, the drinks are good, and the price for dinner is what must bring people in
The service was REALLY slow and waitresses were wandering aimlessly
Thank god there was a temporary manager, as the other one was opening 82, she continued to come over to refresh our drinks and make sure things were OK
If it wasn't for her my review would have been worse
For the price, the food was good not great
My friend also knew the chef, so we had some other courses not on the menu, but even knowing the chef didn't get us the service I would expect at this type of restaurant
I would try again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there
$25 prix fixe sounds like a good deal, but dinner was still $100 for two, the portions were small, and the ($35) wine, clearly where the money is made, mediocre
I'd prefer to go somewhere else and pay $30 for two courses and walk away full
It seems like the Value Meal concept is more a marketing ploy than an actual offering
Pay a little more and go elsewhere - it'd be a better value
Their policy of charging $15 a head for a friend to join your talbe for coffee while you eat desert is insane! The waitress was rude and condescending throughout the meal (within earshot of the mairtre d' and the manager)
Aeroflot has better service than Kitchen 22! Avoid it unless you need to feel insulted
I think people's expectations in these reviews are alittle silly
I went to Kitchen 22 last weekend and for $25 price fix 3 course meal we all thought it was great
I highly recommend it for a small group and if you don't mind have a cocktail at the bar while waiting at the bar
It was good food for a great price at a fun place
highly recommend it
Now for all those who expected higher quality
i suggest you try a more expensive restaurant
the food was not all that
the tuna app was very fishy, the chicken was overcooked, salty and rubbery the rice was soggy and undercooked dessert was uneventful
the best part was the bread and hummus and the staff
otherwise it was all down hill from there
we were not the only disappointed diners
the 2 tables next us had undercooked beans, tough hanger steak, mediocre dessert and same vibe about the chicken
granted, it was a wednesday night, but the service was spectacular and the food was absolutely delicious
when we got there we were told there'd be a one hour wait, but we were seated in less than a half hour
you really can't beat the price, either
$25 for 3 courses - it was well worth it!
granted 3 courses prix-fixe, but if you are interested in friendly service and tasty food you want to SKIP this establishment
The salamon tartare was quite goob, but the service is very very slow
If you 're not rushing to go anywhere, this place is not a bad bet
Just go early if you don't want to wait for a table
Don't expect too much from the host/hostess
Oh
the bread is great!!!!
The food was ok but the Manager could not have been nastier
I would stay away - there are too many good restaurants in this city to put up with such offensive behavior
I was there on 2/24 hoping for a great dinner but the service and the food was horrible
The male manager seemed completely lost and was very inefficient to make the restaurant going
Dinner at Kitchen 22 was fantastic
The service was knowledgeable and pleasant, the food was spot on and the wine list was chosen fairly and economically
So often we are faced in restaurants with an enormity of choice
At Kitchen 22 the choices are made for us, and expertly done
The wine lists mirrors the food, which complements the space, which is a damn fine value for $25
Well done
A simple concept - 3 courses pre fixe@$25 - seems like a deal at first; however, don't let it fool you
You will still walk out paying close to $100 for 2 w/tip
Bottles of wine are $25 or $35 and you will invariably want the superior $35 bottles
Glasses are $7 but are well below the size found at other restaurants
The food is good to above average
Warm bread w/humus served w/olives was excellent and the side of sea salt was a nice addition (but no pepper?!?!) A butternut squash soup w/toasted pumpkin seeds was flavorless and the seafood salad was inexplicably mediocre although the broth was tasty
Chicken w/mushroom risotto was tasty and perfectly executed
Salmon w/pomeroy sauce was good but a little too flaky
Desserts were above average, coffee was extra
Presentation was great
Atmophere was 1980's chic and fun
Friendly, somewhat knowledgable service
My significant other and I visited this jewel box of a resturant recently and man, did we stumble upon something marvelous!! We usually share a strong dislike towards the magenta vegetable known as a beet, but after trying the beet salad, we were in awe! Together at Kitchen 22, we discovered our new found love of beets and it has brought us closer than ever
We'll be back
Thank You Kitchen 22!!!!
Three courses for twenty-five bucks in a groovy-lit setting
A wide range of choices with solid seafood offerings
A bargain, I say
Our group's only beef was the ketchup-flavor sauce with what seemed like sliced wieners that engulfed the Spanish mackerel

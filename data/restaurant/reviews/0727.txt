I went to 66 with a large group of friends for lunch - we had a blast
The food was all top notch and fun for sharing - we ordered several plates to share
The pork belly stood out as the favorite, but the sesame noodles, dumplings and others were all good too
The cocktails were particularly good, esp
the Marja rita, and the sakes were particularly good, can't wait to buy some of that Dreamy Cloud for entertaining at home
The decor was modern, sleek and cool, and the staff was very friendly and helpful
66 is more expensive than Chinatown, but the food is high quality and has that Jean Georges touch, so we all agreed that the experience was worth it
I went to 66 with a group of friends for a birthday dinner
The wait staff was rude and didn't know much about the food
In fact, our waiter mis-pronounced many of the items on the menu
The food turned out less than mediocre for most part, some of the dishes almost unedible
The decor was great with the sleek designs but the ambiance was pretentious
You had all the bridge and tunnel people pretending to be important and hip
The communal table and the stools were too high and uncomfortable
To top everything off, the waiter informed me that he would have to charge $5 per person for serving the cake that I had brought
With nine people in the party that would've been $45
I recommend everyone to walk down a few blocks for real Chinese food that 10 times better and 10 times cheaper
Skip this place!
Cool decor and a beautiful fish tank, but the food fell short
It was the quality of an average chinese place, with more exotic ingredients
We ordered the tasting menu expecting an experience like the omakase at Nobu -- that is, a parade of tasty, small dishes
Instead, they just crammed multiple nearly full-size portions all at once onto the table
Not a very appetizing presentation, and nothing really stood out as really unique or delicious
Truth is, I wish we had gone to New York Noodle Town in Chinatown for some really delicious food at a third the price
The dessert was good
The food was excellent
The dim sum were comparable to those in Chinatown
Appetizers came out just right
The main entrees are family style and are just delightful
Desserts were awesome too
Recommended dishes: Appetizer: crispy squid, Entree: salmon, Dessert: Chocolate souffle, Strawberry ice cream
The portions were so tiny we needed to get pizza afterwards! We were a party of 6, 4 of us ordered the same fish dish, it came out on one plate with four tiny pieces of fish and 1 plate of snap peas for the whole table
We saw tables of 2 around us getting the same amount of food
We asked the waiter why a party of 2 would get the same amount of food as a party of 6, response yes I know it seems strange but that's just how the kitchen does things, if you were a party of 3 you would have still get the same amount
Service was OK, though the waiter was void of a personality
Then they charged a mandatory 20% gratuity, I know its not the waiters fault that the chef thinks grown adults should eat like birds, but it was insulting
Great place to get together for drinks, but if you are planning on staying for dinner, be prepared to drop some $$$'s for average food
Wait staff were very friendly and helpful though
Excellent food and ambience
We enjoyed a fabulous dinner with an excellent ambience
Too long food descriptions
The food was great, but the service was rude and pompous
I was in the middle of a business meeting when my party was asked to move to the louge
It was a Monday at 7:30
it was not busy at all and we were asked to move!?!? Also, I paid $10 for chocolate cake that was dry and hardly tasted like chocolate
The rest of the meal was good, but a little over priced for Chinese take out style food
Although the design at 66 is great, the attitude makes it a terrible place to be
The food is ok, but overpriced, and the nasty hostess makes it not worth your while
I called to try to make reservations for a group and she was curt, inflexible and inevitably hung up on me, saying she couldn't accommodate us, even though it was over a month in advance and she admitted she had the date free
Who needs that kind of attitude for overpriced, mediocre food? Don't waste your time
Did have the pleasure of the communal table which was met with very attentive service
While probably not the most comfortable for a date, not a bad group last minute gig, if you can get a seat
Food was hit or miss delicious
but absolutely not worth the price
you are paying for the job they did on making this place look incredible
Get the mojitos, by far the best thing on the menu
if only the food could match up
66 is awful in the way that so many trendy restaurants are awful
Snotty-hipster front staff (is there anything worse?) who seemed honestly offended that we asked why our table was 45 minutes late; a cold cafeteria room that was clearly designed to intimidate; and haute chinese food that was over-salted to make up for the lack of flavor
One could do better ordering in from Yips
So bad, this place, that I would think that JGV would want his waiters to stop telling everyone that he lives upstairs
We had a 9pm reservation on Saturday, Jan 17th
waited for our table until 10:30, and decided to leave as several parties around us had been waiting for their reservations which were even earlier than ours, and all the maitre 'd could say was that people weren't leaving their tables
they clearly overbooked the hell out of the restaurant the proceeded to ruin several parties nights in the process
to boot, the free appetizers they brought over after we waited an hour, were no better than PF Chang's
the ambience of the place was nice but the food was def
not worth the high price
The food was particularly blah
their menu of drinks was impressive though and the staff was nice
After great meals at Jean-Georges, I had high hopes for 66
The cool Richard Meier interior can't save the overpriced, frankly unremarkable food
The crispy tofu turned out to be heavy, donut-like fried balls of batter with tofu in the middle and a sauce that may as well come out of a bottle
The bok choy was barely seasoned, and the salmon entree was just plain weird
It was half-cooked (not sashimi, not cooked - the fish purgatory) and seasoned with, among other things, a hefty dose of cinnamon that was wholly out of place
Save your money and go to a Chinatown hole in the wall, not this hole in your wallet
This place is great
Next time I go, I am going to try and sit at the long table along the wall! Everyone can sit together and mingle
I read the other reviews and I thoroughly respect everyone's point of view
Mine has been consistently positive each time I go there
Even if you have to wait a bit for a reservation, the hostess will come over to apologize, update you on the wait and make sure you are comfortable
The food is in dim sum, sharing portions
Very tasty, satisfying, great drinks
Crackling pig is superb
The place is impressive, sleek minimalist asian and modern
The service is efficient, affable and make you feel quite welcome
Costs a bit more but so worth it
I would say indeed give it a chance, better off on a weekday to avoid the crowds
I don't know who all these people are who are writing these bad reviews, obvisouly they don't get out much
The food and ambience were amazing
They must be doing something right if they are packing them in on a Monday at 10pm
There is no where in NY that you can get Chinesse food as good as this
This peking duck was 10+ so was the scallion pancakes and the Chille prawns with walnuts was to die for
The dinner was worth every penny
I feel like people don't understand the concept behind 66
Yes, if you love Chinese food in its slop portion style, than obviously you should head to Chinatown or the local Chinese dive, but if you want to experience Chinese in a whole new way, this is the place! Instead of loading on the brown sauces in a bowl of slop, at 66 you experience every taste separetly and delicately, and almost everything is spectacular
I went with another famous chef from Paris and we recieved the royal treatment sampling almost half the menu, and everything was fresh, original and succulent- especially the foie gras dumplings, mayonnaise/milky shrimp, and this shrimp, walnut, oinion and chili pepper entree, the shrimp toast, the cocktails and so on-the desserts were dissapointing, but overall if you don't need to be a typical food-stuffing american and want to enjoy amazing tastes, this is the place!
After waiting a month for a reservation at 66, I expected an ultimate dining experience
This restuarant feel short in almost ever catagory
The food wasn't good, the service sucked, and the host made us wait 50 minutes past our reservation
The chicken was repulsive, the fish was decent, but i could have gotten a much better meal if i had ordered from my local chinese restuarant

I could not have wished for a better experience!
Arrived w/ 4 friends for dinner on Friday at 9pm and the place was empty - soon I realized why
After 30 min
at the place, we had to seek out a waiter for menus drinks
Same thing happened when we wanted to order dinner
While ordering dinner, our wiater abruptly walked away while my friend was ordering - he told us he had become stressed and had to walk away (!!??)
My salad entree had so much pepper in it that it was inedible
The hummus was not flavorful and when we ran out of bread and asked for more, it never came
My friend's fish was undercooked
This place needs a management overhaul
It is not a romantic ambiance as the lights are so bright inside and the staff MIA that it makes for a very frustrating, beyond disappointing experience
Worst experience I've had in years
CBT is the ultimate fusion of quaint intimacy and sexy decadence
The relatively small space feels much larger with its cavernous ceiling and the sheer fabric draping from it
The food is delish - light and tasty tapas
Service is friendly and attentive
Sexy music and perfectly dimmed lighting set the mood
Beautiful authentic Moroccan decor
Never uncomfortably crowded so it's perfect to catch up with friends or a romantic evening
All in all you can't go wrong with CBT!
I enjoyed a wonderful dinner here with a group of eleven friends on Saturday night
We arrived on time at 9 pm for our reservation and ended up waiting another hour before our table was ready
However, the manager apologized for the service, gave us a complimentary bottle of wine, explaining that a waitress had called in sick
Our frustration from having to wait was quickly fogotten because we had such a wonderful meal and were treated so attentively
We ordered 2 tapas platters and 2 bottles of wine for the table, and the bill came to $147! It was more than enough food and drink for everyone, and at $20 per person, including tax and tip, the prices cannot be beat! The ambiance is sexy, but chill, and it would be a great place to enjoy an intimate dinner as well as with a group
Overall, the ambience is nice and the food is good but the waitstaff needs some serious training
I think, first of all, waiters weren't assigned to tables as in the three hours that we were there all three of them came up to us in ten minute intervals to ask the same question but rarely followed through
It was 25 minutes before we even got menus
This went on like this throughout the whole dinner and our entrees came about 1 1/2 h into dinner as they don't keep track of which table ordered what first
The restaurant is nice but it is not amazing enough so that it is worth to be somewhat annoyed at the service for whole three hours as they stretch dinner by not waiting on you properly
This place is fantastic
You can't tell from the outside but then you go up the steps and walk in--WOW
Between the decor and the music, it's quite an ambience that's been created
The food is incredible! Not knowing much about Moroccan food, the menu is perfect to try a variety of different dishes
The wine and champagne list is impressive and the staff is not only helpful but friendly and fun! I will definitely go back -- probably even host a party there
If you're looking to try something freshingly new you absolutely have to try Casablanca Tea Room!
It won't take long for this new place to be disovered! They food, service and atmosphere is absolutely amazing
Casablanca has style, class and the food is tremendous
Go now while you still can get a table
Job well done!
Right in the heart of Soho, what a treat to find this place
The decor, music and food are a great blend that make you feel you have been transported to Casablanca
Not to mentions the movie screen with shots of the original movie (awesome touch)
Their champagne selection is a plus
Good for late night drinks with friends - beautiful crowd at night
Definitely check it out
There are not too many good bars and bistros in this particular area
It has a nice vibe and the help is friendly
I have only eaten brunch there and it was very good
The lounge downstairs with the pool tables is nice too!!! Give it a try
This is exactly the type of place the West Village needs, of couse I would prefer without too much of a crowd
The fact is the food is delicious, with a home cooked and comfort food feel
I love the simplicity of the dishes, which includes nice twists on omelets, salads, and sandwiches
I particularly love the gnocchi souflee, and the honeyed goat cheese salad
It is truly a treat to explore some of this Catalonian inspired food
The two reviews that question service are not indicative of the friendly and genuine servers, who have learned the great balance of letting someone be while at the same time being a help in a moment's notice
It is so good to have a place in the area that I think will only age nicely with time, that will surprise you the very moment you just let go and eat your worries away


This is my new favorite place! It's utterly charming in an OLD WEST VILLAGE kind of way
Very shabby chic
I've had almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed
They obviously don't skimp on the ingredients or the portions
I'm especially fond of the croque monsieur which is rich, crispy, moist and beats out any I've had from any French cafe or brasserie
Following suit is the Gnocci, a sophisticate's mac cheese, the Barca, an almond-encusted chicken breast stuffed with jamon and goat cheese, and a heavenly peanut-butter cheesecake that defies the will power of even the strongest will
The service is super casual, which I like
They are always friendly and sincere and you will never feel like you are being constantly upsold or rushed out of your seat
Quite the opposite; It's a good place to linger over your BYO bottle of wine (with no corkage fees!) or their gigantic bowls of cafe au lait
It's so low-key that it's not unusual to do some big-name celeb spotting there with the likes of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Drew Barrymore, Aaron Eckhardt, and Carrie Russel to name a few
But it's not the next IT place
It's the kind of place you go for an intimate conversation with close friends, and hopefully, it'll stay that way
Although there have been some positive reviews, I have never had a good experience here nor have I spoken to someone who has
The service is typically slow (snails' pace), the food is typically not prepared right (not finished or undercooked - both experiences I have had)
What they do make correctly is usually consumed quickly given how long they make you wait for it
My guess is that people who really enjoy the food here are either 1) drunk from the BYOB, 2) so hungry from waiting so long that shoe leather would taste great to them
Whew! Previous reviewer must've gone here on a bad night
(Also, this is not a tapas/small plate restaurant as Citysearch says
)  Go in the morning
sit there for as long as you want and drink their great coffee or enjoy Truffled Egg Toast, a fabulous Catalan Cobb Salad, or an omelette--made however you want (among other food on their great menu)
The staff is really good about catering to individuals' needs
In the evening it's busier, but BYO and the menu's still great
It's true, this is perhaps not the restaurant to go to if you're in a rush, but if you want to sit for awhile, not be disturbed, and enjoy a fabulous meal, this is the restaurant for you
Service was slow and disinterested, which managed to turn the cute-looking cafe into one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in New York in the past year
Food was more than one hour late, and it came cold and uncooked, the crispy duck was soggy, the baked gnochi was cold and when we inquired into why the service was so slow, we were told they're overwhelmed since the New York Times reviewed them
Do not recommend to anyone - maybe then they'll get their act together
All of the food was fresh, well-prepared, and a great value
I had a shrimp taco, chicken taco, and three chicken flautas, all for $13
The restaurant has no ambience, but is perfect for take-out or delivery
large selection of delightful foods: tortas (fabulous bread!), sopes (amazing!), super tacos (double wrapped and STUFFED with fresh delicious-ness), etc
etc
the list is long
the food is so fresh, well seasoned and tasty they could easily charge a lot more and it would still be worth it
fast and friendly service
dine in or take out
food so good it is even worth a trip
I was tipped off to this place by a friend, and was prompted to add my review because I thought it was a shame that it has such a low rating
This is a roomy restaurant with large windows
The food was wonderful, and service was smooth
We tried the foie gras (which was delicious and a good sized portion), the lobster bisque (very fragrant), and the chateaubriand--the waiter brings you the entire center cut of the filet mignon for you to inspect before slicing it onto your plates
We met with the head chef afterwards and found out that he started at Cafe Luxembourg, and became head chef at the Odeon for a number of years before heading this restaurant

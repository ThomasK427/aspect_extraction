Really cute place but the food was disappointing
Tried it a couple of times just to make sure but it is very over priced for what it is
Every time I experienced a different quality of service
Never have been seated in a timely fashion
It's a shame because it is a great space
This place has become a regular for me
The food is great
The people that go make it as fun as it is
Now the important part
AMAZING MARGARITAS! We get them by the pitcher
Make sure you go
the bar is quaint and cool, the restaurant is NY romantic (tight intimate) and the wait staff was incredibly helpful
the mexican beer selection was very good
everything was working so far, until we got our food
the food was presented well promptly
but the food itself was just your average mexican, nothing special certainly nothing that would justify the average $20 entree price
i went with the individual tacos my wife the shrimp
it looked good on swanky plates such, but the taste was noting to write home about
we were unimpressed
Metrazur is my favorite restaurant in New York
The restaurant is surprisingly quiet considering it is inside Grand Central
I won't lie to you and tell you that it is the ambiance that brings me to Metrazur because it is not
It is a combination of great food, excellent service, and most of all great value!   The best night to go is Saturday when they offer their World Wine Menu
It is a price fixed three course menu that includes a bottle of wine for every two diners
Last saturday I was there with two friends and our bill came to 180 dollars with tip for three courses, wine, and coffee
Tell me where else in New York can you eat for 60 dollars, all included and get this kind of service
Order the chared prawn citrus risotto and you will thank me later
went here last week and i liked it a lot
the service was spectacular
i was seated immediately and was serviced very well (then again it wasn't overly packed)
nice view, overlooking the hustle and bustle that is grand central station
They have air ventilators, but it was a little warm for me, so i do not recommend going on a hot and humid day like i did
Found this place on the restaraunt week list and went because we could get reservations pretty last minute
Both of our entrees (flank steak and mahi mahi) were great, as we really enjoyed our meal
One of the thinks I love about New York is its bartenders
It's easy to find great cocktails and drinks, but not in Metrazur
The design is very nice, but the drinks there there are easily the worst I tried in NY
My friends and I ordered different drinks, and all of them were pretty bad
It's not worthed
Basically for a wedding, this place was horrendous
Do not use this place unless you want to waste your money on horrible stale cheese and food, service which takes your drinks away from the table once you've placed it on the table, waiters that eat your desert while its on the table, non working faucets in the bathroom, and overall very unporfessional service and food
Total waste of money
I would suggest just walking on the pier and bringing a basket of food
You get the ambniance, and edible food
We had a reservation for 9 pm on a Friday night, but never got a table! We waited for 45 minutes, after which we left
The management never made an effort to stop us from leaving! They left us in the lurch, forcing us to hunt for another place to eat at 10 pm!! Given they were super busy, but they shouldn't have taken a reservation that was made two days in advance
To make things worse, the manager publicly berated one of his staff for letting some people take an extra table earlier - which was surely a display to cover their inefficiency
We have been to restaurants all around the world - big and small - but never received such treatment
Go there only if you want shoddy service, pathetic excuses and haughty behavior by an overwhelmed staff, who couldn't care less about you
This quirky little take-out place has good food that's cheap
($6 steak or chicken burritos) No seating
This is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant specializing in brick oven gourmet pizzas
It has a wonderful, cozy ambiance and is a perfect place for a date
The Insalata Mista is delicious, as is the Pizza Margherita and other varieties of gourmet pizzas
Daily specials are also very good, but pastas are a little disappointing
Best of all, it is very reasonable
You can share a salad (large portion) and a pizza and only spend $20-25! Great Value!
This restaurant is unbelievable
The service is excellent and we were attended promply
Their food is out of this world
They know how to set the mood and I highly recommend anyone to try this restaurant
Although I had one of the chef's specials, the white ruffy, their price fixe is a steal
You get soup, salad, a choice of a main coarse, with a choice of dessert and coffe or tea
They make you feel right at home
Notaro restaurant is one of the upper most suffisticated italian restaurants i have ever been to in the city aswell as in my travels
As military personel i rarely get to enjoy such a calm and friendly enviroment from the owner to the staff, excellent food, service and exquisite detail with in the restaurant atmosphere
As a person that moves around alot and has a hectic lifestyle i really recommend notaro as a get away spot for a couple of hours
plus their calamari limone as well as their cacciuco alla toscana which is seafood is excellent
I live in the neighborhood, and I really like this place
The food is good, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is very comfortable
What more do you need to know?  - cRAIG
This place gets pretty good reviews; but it is just ok
I think it has been over-rated
The food was good, reasonably prepared and inexpensive
We shared a shrimp jungle curry and a pick your chick with peanut sauce
The peanut sauce was particularly disappointing; it was mostly cornstarch, and the chain Lemongrass actually has a better sauce
The service was really bad
The waiters were inattentive and slow even though the place wasn't crowded
They didn't have any salad and the waiter didn't tell us this very smoothly
We asked for a napkin (missing from the table) two times and I finally got up and took it off another table because clearly they had forgotten
Then I practically had to beg for the check
I wouldn't go back here
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place (the first being Joya)
This place, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it
The Pad Thai is excellent here, as well
My husband insisted on going there while we were circling the neighborhood in search of the nice place with good food
The food is good, service is good too and the music adds to the relaxing evening! Interesting dessert, but small list to choose from
Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price
I've never been disappointed
While the menu isn't especially groundbreaking, everything I've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty
Service has always been friendly and efficient
The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped
Also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them
I'm Thai and live in Queens, NY
Every Thai people here knows you can find good Thai restaurants everywhere in Queens
Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn
The food is great and authentic
Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat
Thai restaurants are shooting up like weeds in Cobble Hill

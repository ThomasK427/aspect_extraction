Fusion has always recalled bland, or weird tastes to me
But Sapa serves ingenius fusion food, combing in the both of east and west, all in a setting that makes you want to stay forever
THe watermellon duck salad with goat cheese is simply amazing, I never had anything like it before
The fried rice is superb
The brocoli is Ok, a bit greasy
But the baked cod really hit the spot
The dessert was good too
PS: My friend would not leave the bathroom downstairs, it's like a Spa with the long reflecting pool and candles
We had a party of 14 and assumed that we would be there forever, but the service was very quick and the food was delicious
Our server was also very patient with us because 5 members of our group were over 30 minutes late
Try the cod or the ahi-tuna
The rice paper rolls were delicious and the spare ribs were so tender
I was told by a friend to check out Sapa and to go for there happy hour
It was hard to find but once I walked in I knew that it was worth the trip
The place was beautiful, I sat at the bar for two hours and eat oysters and had way too many martinis
I went back two nights later for dinner and had one of the best meals and times in a restaurant in NYC in a long time
What really got me was how nice the people are that work at this place, no attitude everyone was very helpful and fun, not stuffy at all
The crowd was unusually good looking, it seamed that every table had a couple off models at it
I cant wait to go back; Sapa is one of my new favorite restaurants
I recently dined at Sapa for the first time over the weekend with some girlfriends of mine
I must begin by saying that everything was excellent from the moment we walked in to the moment we left
We started by trying some of the exotic cocktails from the rather cute bartender-cosmojito you are my new favorite! Anyway the atmosphere was great-very sleek-definitely good for a fun night out
There was even a great little band that came in and played around 10 pm
The service was excellent and they were very knowledgeable, which I feel has become a rarity lately
The peak of the evening would definitely be Partricia's food-thumbs up the the kitchen, everything we had was awesome, and we ate A LOT
They even brought out a tray of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies after the meal
You gotta try this place it is a definite winner!
We came here for dinner on a weeknight, which wasn't a long wait with the reservation situation
I ordered the Grilled Rib-Eye Steak and loved it, but my boyfriend's Pan Roasted Bass was more on the dry side
The desserts were great! Try the sundae! Overall, nice decor presentation, the waitress seemed quite ditsy forgetful though
I had dinner with my family (party of 9) there recently and to our surprise, it was one of the most pleasant experiences we've had in a restaurant in long time
My parents are usually hard to please but not this time! We wanted to try everything off the menu so we ordered one of almost everything and we enjoyed all the dishes
Service was prompt and the waiter was attentive/friendly
Overall, a good time was had by all
The service was appalling! Granted we were a large group, but we waited at least 45 minutes between courses in a 3-course meal
The highlight of the evening was when the waitress serving our drinks dropped 2 Cosmopolitans on my head (yes, my head)! My hair and shirt were soaked
Ah, a classic moment with co-workers
It took the manager of the restaurant another 45 minutes to come upstairs and apologize
Good news: I got a $50 gift certificate
Bad news: It's for dinner at Sapa
Tip of the day: Wear a wetsuit for dinner and be prepared to wait
And wait
And wait
When you step off 5th Avenue into Sapa, the relaxing atmosphere and warm hostesses will disarm you right away
The restaurant, on a Thursday, was at about 85% capacity
This should change in the next few months when the word gets out about how good this place is
The cucumber martini was the only thing we didn't love - it tasted like wet salad
A lemonade mint drink (I forget the liquor in it) was much much better
The rice paper roll sampler and mooshoo beef appetizers were amazing
Our main courses were delicious - soft shell crab special, cod, and duck were shared on our table and nobody had any complaints
For dessert, we had some sort of carrot cake which was good, but the lavender infused creme brulee was unbelievable
The food and atmosphere combined made for a wonderful evening
From the food to the ambience, this is a fantastic restaurant
We had a group of twelve and had to create a menu for the event
Everyone raved about the food as well as the beautiful space
Even the bathroom was spectacular
I would recommend this place to anyone having a party
My fiance and I had a wonderful time at Sapa on Sunday night
Everyone was very nice, from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left, the hostess, the servers, they were all very attentive and helpful! The food is beyond great! We will definitely return many more times and with more people and we HIGHLY recommend this restaurant!
I love this place! You can hang in the lounge/bar area for pre-dinner drinks and then head to the main dining area for a wonderful dining experience
Very impressive architecture, design and food presentation
A Hit!
Having read the intimate bios on the restaurant's website, I expected only the best from such a friendly owner and executive chef
Although my hangar steak salad appetizer was delicious, the mix of Vietnamese and French was entirely subpar
As for service, the waitress barely noticed us, never bothered to re-inquire how we were doing, and spent most of her time talking to the manager
The snooty upscale dining experience is definitely not worth it
My boyfriend and I read great reviews about the restaurant in a magazine and had to find out for ourselves
Being Vietnamese and a critic for authenticity, I can honestly say that I was truly impressed! The mix of French and Vietnamese was flawless! We had taken a friend and ordered a meal for a party twice our size
Every dish was AMAZING! Great ambience, great service, great food! We can't wait to introduce this restaurant to all of our friends!
Food is pretty good
Ambience is lovely
Service attitude is Horrendous
I've been twice
Once when it was empty, once when it was very busy
Both times were a disaster
They lost our reservation, made us wait 3 hours to sit in the lounge on mini tables
Had to eat w/ our food on our laps
And the waitress was just plain surly
Shockingly bad treatment
Never again, spare yourself
made reservations in advance
everyone was really dressed up
the open space and the lighting works very well
very romantic
ordered chef's tasting menu - food was excellent although a bit overpriced
the chef has impeccable taste in creating fusion food that combines taste and texture wonderfully in your mouth
Having been to most of the top 50 restaurants in NYC according to the Zagat, three things are important to a successful restaurant
They are the atmosphere, service, and food
Sapa definitely gets the first one
The last two are now even close
With all the Asian fusion restaurants popping up all over NYC, Sapa is definitely not on my list
Although we arrived at the restaurant 10 min late, the hostess did not have a table for us
Waiting for more than 15 min
she did not have a clue when we will be seated
This is a BIG waste of time
Why bother to take reservations
This is not a place you would want to waste your time and money on
large group of us had a GREAT evening here
Sat at the gorgeous long bar for drinks first
Drinks were so delicious

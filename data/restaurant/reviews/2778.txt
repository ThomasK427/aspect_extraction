This is a great French resturaunt with a unique atmosphere
It has a wonderful Garden that is enclosed in the winter with a fireplace
Very romantic
Excellent food that is well worth the price
Highly recomended
For a nice meal with wine that won't crush your wallet, check out Patois
The food was very good--especially my starter of Lemon Sardines
My girlfriend's salad was bland and could have used some chevre
Our entrees hit the spot and were better than anticipated--I had the Tempura Soft Shell Crabs and she the Salmon Lentils
Both were delicious
We ordered a bottle of wine -- Graff Riesling - but service was poor and half of it remained in the fridge until we were done eating
We complained and was treated to a delicious Muscat on the house
The desserts were unbelievable -- the Peaches the peaches! And also try the berries and cream
We left satisfied, well-fed, and all for around $100
It wasn't Balthazar, but it was a nice night
In Short Though Carroll Gardens has changed over the past decade, the old Italian heritage of the neighborhood shines through at this more than 100-year-old restaurant
A fading painted sign hangs above the entrance, and inside is full of weathered wood tables, deco-style tile floors and vintage photographs of the owners
Standbys like spaghetti and parmigiana are available, but the real attraction are Sicilian specialties like stuffed sun-dried tomatoes and a focaccia sandwich made with calf's spleen
Old fashioned, unpretentious eatery with great food
No gimmicks or fresh twist here, just straight forward Italian food
I love their frutti di mare salad, as well as the pasta selections

The diningroom is hot in the summer time, cozy in cold weather
Red checkered tablecloth, mismatched silverware, heavy plates that have been washed a million times with scratches to prove it
Makes you feel like you've lived here for a long time
Well, it's not vino and violin Italian, but it IS good short order (think chicken parm heroes, think pasta, think pizza) of a VERY high caliber
They raised their prices a few years ago and it's a LITTLE hard to justify $12
75 for a sandwich, but you'll be full when you leave!
i dont know what it is you see at ninos but i think they should be ashaimed of themselves producing this crap
i dont kno what the other people who rated this were thinking
This is the place to go for some great authentic Italian food! It is a peaceful quiet candlelight atmosphere --- go there with old friends you'd like to catch up with or for a romantic evening with a special person
The Scene Zaytoons has the standard kasbah trappings, with hanging lanterns, dark, tasseled curtains and a decorative hookah or two, but here the food--more than the atmosphere--creates a transporting experience
Open later than most of the nearby restaurants, Zaytoons is packed until closing with diners seeking more flavor and less hype
Friendly service, and outdoor seating in the warm months, eases the crush
The Food The casual Middle Eastern menu looks familar, but the food--made to order in the open kitchen--is a notch above its peers
The basics won't disappoint: Substantial kebabs are served tender and well-seasoned on platters of fragrant rice and piquant hummus, and pita-bread "pitzas" arrive in dizzyingly delicious combinations
Goat cheese with scallions, peppers and bacon, sun-dried tomatoes with mozzarella and herbs--they invigorate the usual Mideast fare with a touch of the neighborhood's Italian flavor
I live right around the corner from Zaytoon's and have been dining there regularly for the past 5 years
The food is phenominal and the prices are great
Their hummus is outstanding
The falafel and the pizzas are all very good as well
In my opinion it is the best restaurant in the nieghborhood, and that's really saying something as there are many great places to eat there
This is always the first place I recommend to people who are exploring or new to the area
This food was excellent! I had the sundried tomato, pepper, scallion dip with the flat bread for a starter
Then I had the shish kabab (lamb) with thier fragrant rice and light salad, DELICISOUS!!! My bf did not like all his food but I made ALL the right choices
:-) For the amount of food we ate, STUFFED to the GILLS and my bf can eat, it came out to $40 for the two of us including the ice mint tea we had! WONDERFUL deal
could not believe how inexpensive it was!!!
Some Friday's I'm just broke, but since I'm committed to eating out every Friday night, I 'm glad there is a Zaytoons
On a cold winter evening, when you open their door, the smell of roasting overwhelms you
Your glasses fog and you settle in for some soup and hommus
Toni and I brought our own wine last week
Good deal - 4 dinners for less than $35
total
Delicious!   michele
We had gone to Zaytoon's numerous times and had good experiences
Recently, we called to place an order for delievery
When the order arrived, it was incorrect
We called the restaurant and I spoke to the owner
He insisted this is what I had ordered and refused to fix the problem, so we sent the food back with the delievery man
A few minutes later the owner actually called me and YELLED at me! He said to never order or come back there again, which of course, we won't
I had heard of Zaytoons before, but had never been there to check it out
The food was some of the best Middle Eastern food I have ever had
I definitely recommend this place to anyone craving some steaming hot schwarma
This place is great
Everyone is so nice and the service has greatly improved
The kabobs are cooked to perfection
Everything on the menu is fabulous
It is very affordable and a great place to go on a date
Don't forget to BYOB
Zaytoons' homemade pita bread is the best I've ever had, hands down
The sandwiches, platters, and pitzas are top notch too, but I could make a meal just out of their pita bread and babaganoush
YUM
The pitzas (pizza toppings on a large, thick pita) can feed two if you share an appetizer, and that makes it easy to walk out of here without spending a fortune
Also recommended is the falafel platter or the platter with olives, hummus, etc
The restaurant is one of the few on Smith Street with a bring your own beer/wine policy
I've tried most of the menu and have never been dissapointed
Their appetizers are especially nice and a selection of them can make a wonderful light meal
The lentil soup is a must
I crave Zaytoons at least twice a week
Went there on a Sunday recently
My chicken pita sandwich was the best pita sandwich, BEST, that I've ever had
All ingredients were delicious, but the tahini was out of this world
The falafel sandwich was also very good
And it's great value: $12 for two sandwiches and two drinks, incl
taxes but before tip
Now for the bad part
We had to wait a good 45 minutes to get our food served
We're talking pita sandwiches here
They were woefully understaffed: only two waiters instead of the four needed, short in the kitchen too (this I was told later)
Waiter seemed like a nice guy but he was overwhelmed and impossible to track down
Could've been simply a bad day
Or they could simply be suffering from their own success
After a pitcher of Sangria right down the block this place was an oasis for a good bite to eat
The hummus was spectacular along with the shrimp pizza made to order
The BYOB policy saved us a few bucks and I left very satisfied! I'll be back
Cheap, good food with a friendly staff and a BYOB policy - what more could you ask for? Zaytoons has mastered the art of serving standard middle eastern food that can easily become a staple in anyone's diet
I often have a hard time prying myself away from the chicken shwarma to try other delicious items on the menu
This is a must try and easily fits within anyone's budget
I think it's even worth a trip for non-Brooklynites!
I love the inexpensive, authentic food at Zaytoons, but their delivery service is horrible! I've had them deliver to me twice, and both times the appetizer I ordered was missing

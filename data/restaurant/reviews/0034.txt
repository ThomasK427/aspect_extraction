The meals are hardly edible
I took 6 kids there and only 1 was able to complete their meal
The food need to be more palatable
I wish I had went to McDonalds
My parents were here from MI so I thought it'd be fun to take them somewhere with entertainment+good food
Note to self: entertainment isn't a bunch of loud people with fake accents hovering around, screaming in your ear while you're trying to look at the menu
In short, they were so annoying i wanted to shoot myself in the head, and our waitress was braindead
She forgot to bring out our appetizers until halfway thru dinner, when she remembered + asked if we still wanted them
What? Of course not! My apetite was long gone
I had the tuna, which tasted like dead fish that laid in the sun for 3 wks
i've had better mashed potatoes from a box, and the vegetables were soaked in oil
The fam didn't like their food either
If I ever pass by this place again, I'll try not to puke on myself
Only two words - overpriced McDonald
Or, tourist trap
Unusual decor but doesn't worth the $$$
Go to Slaughtered Lamb Pub
Also unusual, but cheaper
The entertainment was only so-so, and we saw most of it on a TV since we weren't seated on the first floor
The food was mixed - my salad stunk, my wife said hers was good -- and the service, acriss the board, was among the worst I ever experienced in my life
Our waitress kept disapearing, the bartender did not mix our drinks correctly, and the hostess would not adjust an incorrect bill
I left this restaurant feeling angry and ripped off
This place has horrible food, I dont think i have tried anything on the menu that was worth recommending to any of you that might visit
The decor maybe great for young kids but as an adult this place was an horrible experiance, it didn't bring the kid in me
Service was extreamly slow, the wait is ridiculous
Don't bother going here, there are so many better places in this very fine city
Must visit
That's it
I if i tell you why, you may ponder
DON'T PONDER
Just go
Absolutely the worst experience at this restaurant on Feb 1, 2003
Our family from Indiana came to celebrate their daughter's 16th birthday
After waiting from 5PM to 6:00PM outside, we were let in
We were told to go up to the bar on the 4th floor
The bartender ignored us for 30 mins because she was too busy
They told us we would be seated in 45 minutes by the theatrical acts
Around 7:00, they said we would be seated in a corner table on the 1st floor
Subsequently, some other family was seated there
After I yelled at a manager on the ground floor as we were leaving in utter disgust, he swore that he would work something out
We were told we would be seated by 7:15PM
We left at 7:20 PM
This restaurant is the most disorganized place we've been
Never again!
The food isn't the best
they could have a little more variety but the staff is outrageous! great place to go for a birthday or almost any event
The best location is the avenue of americas
1
They only accept American Express
2
Slow service 3
Seriously overpriced
I paid $16 for what is basically a philly cheesesteak
4
Entertainment? It was hardly worth the extra $2 entertainment charge
Aren't the food prices enough? 6
$6 for a bottle of beer? Ouch
Overall, go elsewhere
A dinner for two shouldn't cost $85 (w/ tip) for basic American fare
Entertainment was OK at best but was very loud
We went for lunch (party of 8)
We waited between 50 minutes and one hour for our meals after being seated
Our meals were cold when we got them
The waiter asked us to hand him our plates and was put out that we asked to see a manager
The manager took 15 minutes to come see us to hear our complaint
He said he would look into it but never came back to us
Instead each of our 4 kids was given a useless, cheap, treat bag
STAY AWAY!
I used to love this place, many years ago
It was fun, the food was OK, and the prices were decent
But it's declined sharply
After a long wait, you'll get shown to a table where you might be able to see a tiny bit of the action (and there's less action every year)
The service is slow
The food is BAD
my nachos were a pile of crumbs under a few whole chips
And the prices have risen to four-star levels
AVOID
When we arrived there was no free table so we waited at the bar for quite a long time
Finally we were seated and then were told they only accept cash or American Express
I really would have been angry if we had no cash
Our waiter wasn't attentive at all
The food was expensive and not worth the price
The entertainment was enjoyable
You were afraid to take a bite of food for fear that you would start to crack up
It was very funny and I enjoyed it, but am not sure it was worth the price or poor service
Sometimes you are forced, due to circumstances to go to a restaurant where the food is secondary to the ambience
At the Jekyll Hyde Club, it isn't even secondary - it's an afterthought with a bad aftertaste
The entertainment may have been of inerest when the club was new and things worked but most of the gimmicks and gadgets are broken and unrepaired
To say the service was bad would be an outrageous compliment - the staff clearly doesn't care
This is still my absolute favorite place to go in the City
For all those with an unusual sense of humor, The Jekyll Hyde Club Restaurant is the place to go! The food is good (although a bit overpriced), the entertainment is quite amusing, and the atmosphere is perfect for an evening of fun
Great for cast parties and unwinding after productions wrap, hanging out with old friends, or showing your out-of-towner friends a good time
AVOID this restaurant! My husband and I took our 9 yr
old son here on a recent trip to NYC
We were seated at a table w/ a large robot next to us
The hostess stated that we shoudn't be alarmed because the robot would come to life during the meal and that many people in costume would come around to our table and entertain us
Much to our son's disappointment, neither thing ever happened(we were there 2 hrs)
Also, the service was TERRIBLE - the server blamed everything on the kitchen
The last straw came when we got the bill
We were charged a entertainment fee AND this place doesn't take Visa or MC, only Discover BUT they did have their own ATM machine downstairs we could use which had a $3 fee

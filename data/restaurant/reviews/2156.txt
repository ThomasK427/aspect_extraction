00 including tip
(hint: monday night is tuna night-- they have $1
00 tuna roll specials!)
This place has the best teriyaki EVER
Try their chicken or Negima
Their sushi isn't bad either
Good prices, Good food
EXCELLENT restaurant
Very nicely renovated
You never need to wait 15 minutes to be served, the food is right there in front of you
Nice small sushis rolling out on a factory like conveyer
Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good
I actually find it refreshing, but after looking at the same thing going round and round for 40mins, it gets boring pretty quickly
Service is excellent, and price is right (I have the membership card)
This place is fresh and cool
The ambiance is nice, it features a conveyor belt apparatus
You just sit and watch the food pass by and pick out whatever you like
They have a menu in which you can order stuff not offered on the conveyor belt
Be prepared to wait a bit
The line can be hectic at evenings
They have an upstairs restaurant which is more elegant but the fun is downstairs with the conveyor belt
The downstairs is not recommended for groups since you have to wait for a row of seats to be available
Also go in the evenings after 6pm or so
That's when they bring out the good food
Our first visit was over 4 years ago and we still enjoy every meal and every visit
The owner and staff are so accomadating and many dishes are prepared to our liking
And the prices are so reasonable for the quality and portions
This place is great! This is your quint essential NYC, old school Italian where the host knows his customers by name, treats them well and will prepare almost anything for them
It is a quiet, romantic place
The staff is attentive and friendly
The food is exceptional and the price is reasonable
What can be better than old school NYC Italian
It is definitely worth a trip to Murrray Hill to check it out
The food at Porta Rossa was very good
Everyone in our party of 8 was very happy with their food
Service was very friendly, accommodating, but inept
The chef will prepare anything you want, on the menu or not
Anything extra, not originally asked for when you ordered, could not be obtained
The server never re-filled our wine glasses, nor did he ask if we wanted another bottle (which we did)
Additionally, we ordered after-dinner drinks that never arrived, despite several pleas that they come before dessert ended
The dining room is very small but you were not piled on the other diners
The decor is fine and clean
All in all, the food is good, it's clean, but go on an off-day, not when their waiters aren't swamped with a full dining room
I recently visited Porta Rossa for the first time
From the outside, the place seemed to blend in with the monotone of the other storefronts on the street, but once you walk inside, that all changes
Though space is a bit tight and a bit too dim-lighted, Porta Rossa has a cozy and warm interior that is nicely furnished with meticulous and well-chosen wall adornments
The wait staff was friendly and attentive, adding humor to our meal
The food was actually very good and came in large portions
It was comparable, if not, in some cases better than the food of some upscale restaurants where you would be paying almost twice the amount for the same dish
The overall dining experience Porta Rossa gave me is highly commendable and I would positively recommend visiting this hidden gem
LOVE this place!!! They have the best food and the best service
The place is small but you will feel like you are in Italy the moment you walk in
Everyone should try this place it is incredible, really
This restaurant is the absolute best that I have ever been to
The food is delicious, the atmosphere is serene yet enjoyable, and the service is impeccable
I had the lobster soup which was very good and the snapper in a garlic and white wine sauce which was absolutely delicious
I give it TWO THUMBS UP!!
Fabuolus little find
Terrific food and wine, great service
A great place for a date, or to hang out with a few friends
I discovered this restaurant about nine months ago, and have been back twice since then
The atmosphere is very elegant and has a very relaxed and old world feel to it
Features include a lovely waterfall, which adds to the serenity of the place
The food is superb, and I am especially fond of the veal
The desserts are wonderful too
Try either the chocolate mousse or Italian cheesecake
Add a superb wine list and the fact that the staff knows how to let one relax and enjoy a meal, and the result is an amazing dining experience that far too few New Yorkers know about
Give it a try
You will not regret it
for the most wondrous dining room in the city you need to experience paone's
it is immaculate,it's elegance is understated,mr
alphonso's manners and graciousness are impeccable
for oenophiles, the wine list is unmatched in manhattan
the food preparation is flawless,the desserts are to die for and if you're a tony bennett aficionado you will sample many of his greatest hits in the background!
We just love going here when we have time to sit and have a leisurely dinner
It's not one of those eat quick so we can seat someone else
It's one of those places where you sit and have a drink before you even get the menu
Great wine list and marvelous food
The shrimp oreganata was excellent as well as the scampi and also the veal dishes
Do not miss the homemade desserts Ummm
I read good reviews and had to check it out
The masala dosa was good, but the other stuff I ordered was very distasteful, and I will not go back here
I have had much better South Indian food
I went to this place thinking that it is the same as the Udipi Palace in LA
I was very disappointed
This place has a great lunch buffet
And dinner is wonderful too
The mulligatawny soup is a standout as is the masala dosa and plain paratha
A great place to get a meal before seeing a movie in Kips Bay
This is a great place for pasta, veal and seafood dishes
The portions are generous, and the food tastes like your Italian grandmother from Jersey made it
Nothing complicated, just tasty
They have an exceptionally priced wine list as well
A great place for before or after a movie at Kip's Bay Theater
A large outdoor dining patio in front
Bring Fido along too!
My girlfriend and I found Christina's by accident after trying to find a restaurant in the area that had closed down
The unassuming outside of Christina's hides it's wonderful decor
The food was wonderful and the staff took great care to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed
We weren't rushed to leave as we sat to exchange christmas presents

Amazing Japanese food, but the portions are chickenfeed; a no drinks, no dessert meal is at least $30 to $40 with mainstream items
CitySearch needs to upgrade to $$$   Ambience is great, quiet and peaceful, service is very good
Waitress helpfully and very politely assisted with choices for new customers
The food here is incredible
The selection of homemade noodle soups is great, as are the sashimis
The only thing is- if you want to actually get full, it gets a little expensive
I don't know how citysearch was able to put only two $$, because the total is actually going to be higher than that
attendion to detail, great use of spices and condiments, impecable presentation and fresh noodle, udon and soba are just like in Japan, service was a little slow and forgetful they could use more help
Food is excellent
Service really needs improvement
The waiter spilled tea on the table didn't even bother wiping it
When I asked for him to wipe the table he gave me the dirtiest look
The last 4 times I've been there I had horrific service
Only when I go there with older people like my father I get excellent service
Am I not good enough customer? Whatever
Obviously their original restaurant in Japan is far better
So unfortunate
This is a great place to go -- especially on a date
The room is small and elegant (not stuffy or snobby)
The service is extremely attentive
The dishes are cheap for the level of quality
This was my first time going -- I went with 2 other people
The waiter helped in selecting dishes
In the end, we got 3 appetizers -- all of them great, and we each got a noodle dish
I got the cold soba with sea urchin (pretty adventurous for most), and this was fantastic
My friends each got hot noodle dishes -- served in a seafood-like broth
Both of those were really good as well, but the best way to enjoy the fresh noodles is probably to get them cold, as the texture and flavor will be unaffected by the broth
Dinner with tax/tip no drinks was approximately 30 per person
best Japanese restaurant in town
hands down
minimalistic, yet intriguing decor
They have such a great selection of soba dishes (hot, cold, plain, duck, uni, etc
) and the noodles are indeed handmade
Portions are rather small, even for Japanese food
Their two selections of soba sushi for that evening was yummy and their two different types of yellowtail sashimi were fresh (they ran out of the higher grade one by 9pm)
We felt, overall, this place was overpriced for what you get (these are just noodles, after all), but the food is well-executed, the space is nice and the service is good
A cheaper alternative is that soba place on E9th, but we felt that they don't have as good sashimi there
If you want an upscale soba place, Honmura An is definitely the place to go
If you are sophisticated enough to tell the difference between fresh soba and frozen/dried soba, this will be by far the best soba you will taste
(Btw, can't believe Reviewer #1 recommended East over Honmura An! Talk about an amateur palate
)
We must have had good karma on our side
Our party of three was seated right away
We started with baked goat cheese in a pomegranite sauce
It was delicious! Everyone enjoyed their entrees and the price was very reasonable
The service was polite and attentive
I would highly recommend it if you're in the area
waitress seemed very impatient when we would ask for something (like where my soda was, if we could have more water)
other than that everything else was ok
cute little place
my roasted chicken sandwich as good
good for a local meal
It's interesting to hear what the last two reviewers had to say because it is exactly the experience I went through
I went with a total of 7 people
Service was terrible
We went right after the peak time so no line but we all had to fit to a table that usually seats 4
And yes, the stools! We had to sit on our coats because of the stools! Food was average but the waitress NEVER came to see how we were doing (if we needed refills on water, if we needed extra plates, etc) I know why since gratuity was already included
Bottom line: service was just awful
Dont' recommend at all, especially if going in large groups
I went with 5 friends for dinner
waiter/hostess were extremely impatient and unaccomodating
they don't really have the space to accomodate a table of 6 but i guess since they was no other business they were desperate for any customers
they put together two tables which was fine, but the 2 people at each end of the table were forced to sit on STOOLS
everyone was forced to eat with their jacket in their lap for passing waiters
when real chairs were requested, they were refused even though we were surrounded by empty chairs
as a final insult, i couldn't believe the 18% gratuity service when i asked 3 times to have my water refilled, to no avail
considering the prices on the menu, i'd rather go somewhere else where they know how to refill water and real chairs for everyone, something you can even get at mcdonald's
Six of us went in February
Prompt seating was the best service they provided, then downhill from there
Due to overcrowded-ness, the hostess rudely demanded us not to hang winter coats over seatbacks
Due to waiting customers, the waitress pushed us into ordering without much time to look at menus
We were going to forget about the ghastly treatment if the food was to be exceptional
But no, just average
The final straw came when they refused my friends request to switch the stool he had been sitting on the entire time (lack of chairs at time of seating) for a normal chair after he began experiencing back pain
Reason? Customers *might* show up (no line at the time)
Just as we were puzzled by their horrendous attitude, the bill came and showed added gratuity
Yep, 6 were enough and thus they did not need to care
Cafe Gitane is cash only which is a pain but, doesn't hurt your wallet with it's low prices
The food is really good, interesting, and the presentation is nice
Wines are really good, the rose wine is especially good
Service is a little slow which can be annoying at times
They don't take reservations but the wait is usually decent
I've been going to Cafe Gitane since 2000 and I've never had a bad eating experience there
It's true the restaurant is crowded, busy, and service can be slow
However, I love the vibe
When I miss France, am not rushed, and want to be surrounded by a buzz and multilingual conversation, CG is where I go
The serving sizes are not large, but I still feel it's a good value because quality is solid and flavors are delicious
I regularly get the couscous, fish (menu changes with the season), the salads, crab cakes, and wine - i first tasted Pouilly Fuisse there
Some of the clientele may think they're all that, but why let that bother you? Watch the world go by and enjoy!
I've been to this place countless times and am never, ever disappointed by the food
Some of the wait staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, but (as expected) not 100% of the time
If you're looking for good food - really flavorful, great tasting food - this is honestly THE place to go
I went here with a friend this weekend - the aroma of fresh herbs is hard to resist from the outside
The food was excellent, the coffee was excellent, the service excellent! We had the tuna cerviche salad, pasta and a french dish consisting of ground beef, not to mention a slew of appetizers
The waitstaff was so friendly, we'll definitely be coming back!
Great place to have really good cappucinos, small plates and people watch
Always better during the weekday, but still a lot of fun on the weekends
I've come back here countless times and everyone I bring loves it
The atmosphere is relaxed and pleasant, and the food is superb--I particularly love the cucumber/yogurt salad, the roast potatoes and the humus--and you can't find a better value anywhere in the city
The waitstaff can be a little inattentive sometimes, but they are nice and helpful once you attract their attention

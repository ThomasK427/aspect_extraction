This is not a place to go if you want real authentic japanese ramen
the noodles are soggy and the soup base is so-so
the stools are uncomfortable, and services are poor
I love the food in this place
Get house ramen
Get pork buns
Go for oysters if you want
But leave your nice clothes at home
You'll be sitting in front or very close to the kitchen with delicious aroma that is great for your nose but not on your clothes
I spent a fortune getting the smell off my clothes but had a great time chowing down the food
This is the by far the best Japanese noodle bar I ever been in in my life and cannot imagine one better than this
maybe in Japan
Reading some of the reviews below makes me laugh
It is a noodle bar not Masa for God's sake
In fact, it is the simple design, the camaraderie feel, plus the Ramsey-like attitude of the chef that add charms to this noodle joint
I must say though the Momofuku ramen has so many ingredients that it almost overwhelmed the noodle itself
But with all the fresh ingredients particularly the savory Berkshire pork, it is simply delicious
Yet the biggest surprise of all is their oysters
They are unbelievable - fresh, clean, plump, lightly salted brine and a nice kick from the kimchi puree - they are oysters to die for
And the pork buns
I don't have to add more
Yes, I had better ramen at other authentic ramen places and at cheaper prices but I will definitely return to Momofuku for more of everything
The people giving this place bad reviews need to chill
Or maybe they just need to go to some more upscale joints
I mean, it's a noodle bar and people are complaining about it being cramped? I don't get it
Anyway, I eat the pork ramen at least 2x a month
I am addicted
And, he has this sweet summer corn sauteed with bacon and miso butter that is just heaven-HEAVEN! Honestly, just go there
It's that good
this place is cute, small, and clean w/ a lowkey atmosphere and amazing food!! the kitchen is open so you can see your food being made and see the chefs working to get the orders done quickly but w/ quality
you HAVE to TRY the PORK BUNS
AMAZING!! this appetizer will make you want to come back to this restaurant on a regular basis, the berkshire pork just melts in your mouth and the combination of everything in it is perfect
the menu's always changing so be sure to not wait too long to go back if you fall in love w/ a dish from here
The chefs all had an attitude
we are cool, and we work in an open kitchen vibe
the service was loud and abrasive
sighing when an order was placed to go
the stools were uncomfortable and every person going to the bathroom hit me in my back
my cold noodles were lukewarm had a lackluster taste and bland flavor
My companion's Ramen was really bad
There was so little soup in her bowl, that it looked like leftovers
too salty and the noodles were severely overcooked
It amazed me that this place was so crowded
The parting words from the waitress, so you guys gave up on finishing that
huh? it was hard work and we gave up, just like I have on Momofuku
last note: shaking sake in the bottle before you pour it is not kosher but was common practice
I had a ramen with pork, and it was aweful
Too less soup per bowl, and the soup was way too salty
The noodle was not al dente at all, and there was no chewiness and strength
The service was rough
The waiter shook the bottle of cold sake before pouring it, and it made the sake look like soda
This restaurant is so badly set, everyone hit your back whenever they walk by
There is absolutely no reason to go back to this place
The chef really knows how to cook pork -- especially the pork bun and ramen are excellent, although their Korean foods are mediocre
But the last time I went there, my friends and I (four of us) ended up waiting one full hour
They initially told us we would have to wait 15 to 20 minutes, and kept giving seats to couples who came much later than us
When I complained, the waitress replied, what, you want me to kick out the customers? Very rude, to say the least
I would have walked out, if it were not for my friends
It's definitely not a good place for any group bigger than two
As it's what happens to any decent, small restaurant in New York, it's getting way too crowded for a pleasant meal
I am a ramen lover, but did not fall in love with their signature ramen bowl
The noodles were overcooked and sticky, compared to an 'al dente' chewiness of what ramen noodles should be as a minimum
The soup, although tasty, was small in quantity and the noodles virtually absorbed the moisture and leaving a dry taste
It's not the question of what they serve, but how they serve it
Until they get it right, I'm not going back
Went last Friday for dinner with 2 other friends
This place only has 2 bars - no tables
Wouldn't recommend for parties larger than 3-4
The appetizers I had were excellent - pork buns and razor clams
The noodles were good and chewy, but the broth was so salty! Not sure if that's normal or if the kitchen couldn't maintain quality control because of the large weekend crowd
Our server was really nice and accomodating
Get there before 7:30 for dinner or get ready for a really long wait - this place doesn't take reservations
Also, try to get a seat at the main bar, because I sat at the smaller bar by the entrance and it was getting so crowded with people waiting that it became a bit unpleasant towards to end of the meal
ah momofuku pork buns and noodles sublime the chef yells at staff
Wow- I've eaten here a few times already (and will continue to do so) and am in love! The pork is just delicious, try it in the ramen as well as the pork buns
It must take hours to get it so tender
Great place to get a bite after a day of shopping! The staff is also friendly
This restaurant couldn't possibly ask for better press
It is as if New York magazine exists only to celebrate this guy's existence
I have been maybe 10 times --at this point it's become a ritual
noodles keep getting better, everything else keeps getting worse
His pork buns were otherworldly when they used the shredded pork, now he's subbed in the pork belly which is 92% fat
Life's too short for that, come on
I don't care if that's authentic, noone likes biting into pure fat
come on!
The Scene Even though the new space of this 20-year Village veteran is triple the size of its former home, a line still snakes out the door for its popular weekend brunch
The sleek, red-and-white decor, featuring a stone bar and sparkly beaded curtain, may not feel as cozy as the former spot, but it actually suits the stylish crowd better
The Food Solid, reliable bistro fare like duck confit, steak frites and grilled ostrich can be found on the dinner menu, while brunch is known for its reasonable prices and expertly mixed bloody marys
Healthy eaters can enjoy an egg white omelette with spinach and goat cheese, while those wanting lunch fare can dig into a chicken sandwich awakened by a sharp and sweet cranberry mayo
The hearty frittata packed with potatoes, Canadian bacon, tomato and Jarlsberg, is a hangover's best friend, but it's the thick, berry-topped French toast that really steals the show
We went there for a glass of wine in the wine bar
Rouge I think?
After a very nice glass of South African wine (
pinottage) and a glass of white for my date, we decided to have dinner : thanks to the bartender downstairs, who told us about the food! That was a good experience! Thanks to the waiter, who helped us to choose a nice bottle of Margaux from Bordeaux, France and congratulations to the chef ! I had the Cassoulet : That was delicious! Check it out!
Dinner was a problem here
Although the food was good, the wait staff was clueless and erratic
Be prepared to wait and to keep asking for an update to find out when your order is coming
No logic to who's served and when
Not a place for urban hipsters into good food in quiet surroundings
It can be loud here

Lastly, the vegetarian in our group highly enjoyed the vegetarian coco-roco platter, and we all got a bite of what they called peruvian risotto and it was soooo tasty! overall great place, lots of options, ceviche menu is incredible!
Delicious food and great atmosphere
Best sangria in Park Slope
I used to eat here a lot, but for some reason forgot about it and haven't been back for about 4 years
Now that I've returned, I'd say it's better than ever and I will definitely eat there again soon!
Just got back from Coco Roco, and it was such an abominable time that I am compelled to write my first ever restaurant review
Where to begin? The service was barely existent, as our waitress disappeared for a half hour at a time while serving? other tables
The food, which used to be fabulous, was just okay
My dish, a sort of paella, was listed on the menu as having clams; instead it came with mussels and no explanation
The drinks were, like the food, just okay
It was a meal and service that you would expect to get at an airport restaurant, where it would be JUST OKAY
And the prices have gone up! They used to have great food
No more
Now only the french fries were special
We have been going there for at least 6 or 7 years
We won't be going back
I went there with my fiance and a couple this past saturday at 10pm
The place was completely packed
But the crowd brought my hopes up
unfortunately, it all started with a crooked table
The waitress was horrible! She was completely spaced out
The food took a long time
The taste was salty with absolutely no authentic flavor
I had the poached salmon with ginger broth-disgusting! My fiance's dish should of came with mashed potatoes but instead came with sticky rice
The waitress neglected to tell him that they ran out of mashed potatoes
She came to ask us about how everything was going when we only had our bottle of wine at the table
The only thing Coco Roco has going for itself is the lively ambience
that's it! Complete waste of time
the place must be under new management
I am a frequent coco roco customer and have been for 4 years
It appears there has been a change in managment at coco roco and the place is going downhill rather quickly
Delivery has gone from quick to painfully slow, over an hour even at slow times
My past 3 deliveries have all been missing items, and today's put me over the edge
Dry almost brittle chicken, wilted warm salad, missing rice and beans and half full room temperature fruit drinks were all a disapointment compared to how I remember it being for the past 4 years
It was clear my order had sat in a bag for an hour and was only delivered after I called and asked where it was
In the end, it took me 2 hours to recieve all of the items I had ordered
This is one of my favorite restaurants
I've eaten at Coco Roco for about 5 years, and it's always been great
The food's delicious, the service is friendly and prompt, the prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is upscale but very comfortable
If you haven't had Peruvian food before, you really should try it
I really can't think of anything negative to say about this place
I live in the neighborhood so have been to CR on and off thru the years--though I try to avoid it
Today (I went b/c we were a big group and they are spacious--and by the way COLD) was by far the worst experience ever
I had the heuvos y espinica served with ice cold home fried potatoes (they were out of rice)
The eggs were covered in garlic sauce (ew!!) and almost slightly warm
The meal was complemented by a salty green salad slopped on the side of my plate
I never got any water
Half of the table got their drinks and then about half an hour later, we got ours
We had to wait preposterously long for each and ever thing: drinks, food, bill, change
I was embarassed for inviting Manhattanites in for this brunch
the food was amazing, just like my friends told me, and as well many of the reviewers
it was also true that the service was lacking
my table of four was not totaly neglected, but there was a lag in how promptly we were being served
It seemed like there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant! I don't know how he did it
I've been here a handful of times because the food is amazing, but boy, the service sure stinks
It'll drive you nuts! Visit this fabulous eatery only when you are feeling calm and relaxed, and have plenty of time to kill
After having heard great praise for Coco Roco, I foolishly suggested it to some out of town quests visiting family in the neighborhood
Whoops! We gave up waiting after an hour for a table for 4
The considerable effort it took to get soemone at the front to take our name and info should have been a clue
Other than an overworked, when visable, waitstaff who attempted to preform under the glare of their moody vocaly abusive manager it was hard to determine what the problem was
They had a few empty tables seemed to be open to the public
We probably would have stuck out the wait if we could have gotten a drink at the bar but apparently it was closed or only for show
I used to be a regular here, never again! Perhaps word got out they are unable to handle the crowds? Not only did we wait almost an hour for a table for 2, it was an additional nightmare of confusion to place our orders let alone get food
I used to enjoy their chicken, it was drier than old jerky
To make matters worse our experience was completely soured as we witness the manager yelling at his overworked staff in front of the whole restaurant
We tipped the bartender directly as she alone had jumped from behind the bar to take orders serve food
Shame to see a fun little place come to such a horrid end, we will not be returning, ever
I don't think I've ever had a worse dining experience than this one
I'm a regular at Coco Roco, where the service is reliably sketchy, but this was a nightmare
It took 40 minutes just to get the chance to order
They were out of everything on the menu and the food still took forever
Our plates were never cleared
Nobody checked on us
Our waiter spent most of the night sitting at a table talking to friends
While the food was, admittedly, still excellent, the service was so deplorable it's unreal
About the only staff member to impress me was the bartender who ended up running food and drinks all night
Sorry guys, you lost me
It had been a little while since I was last at Coco Roco, but when I went this weekend, my favorite Park Slope eatery was even better! I don't know what has happened in the kitchen, but old favorites are presented in a new and beautiful way, and the specials are more creative than ever
The staff is warm and friendly, and the bartender makes an awesome drink with something called pisco
You gotta try it!
Considering the other options nearby, this place stands out
Always a fun place to go eat, especially with a bunch of friends
Sometimes it gets busy and you might have to wait a while to get a large table for a party of 5 or more
Worth the wait
They're famous for their chicken but there are plenty of other excellent choices on the menu
Explore them for yourself, none are disappointing
The best mojitos ever! And the food - try the ceviche! It's awesome
I can't wait to visit again
I had the pleasure of eating here last saturday night
I found the service to be outstanding and generous
As a chef I really appreciated the well executed dishes that were full of crisp and vibrant flavor contrast acting in harmony and perfect balance
The tuna ceviche was out of this world
Careful balancing of citrus (lime) and heat (chili's) lit up the palate
Each dish had its own distinct character and pleasant flavor surprises
Chicken was spit roasted, moist and exploding with Peruvian flair
All sorts of treats that you won't normally find on menus elsewhere
Great atmosphere with seemingly smiles on the faces of everyone in there
A must try
Having Coco Roco in my neighborhood is such a treat - whether it's a great priced dinner or brunch you just can't go wrong here
There brunch menu it great - it will take a bit of time to get out to you so go on a beautiful day bring your paper and try to sit in the front window with the door open

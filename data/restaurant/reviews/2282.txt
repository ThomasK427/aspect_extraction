The host remembered us later that evening and called us by name without telling him
That added a very personal touch to the the dining experience and demonstrated that our business was appreciated
For the wine enthusiasts, you may want to try their unlimited wine sampling with your meal
One word of caution is that the entree prices are more expensive after 7:30 PM
Love wine a good deal? Then visit Cite
On our 1st visit to NYC we chose Cite -after 8pm they offer prix fixe which includes unlimited wine
We were sceptical: did they actually mean unlimited what would the quality of wine be?  We were delighted that we were indeed offered unlimited supplies of 4 wines: Tattinger champagne, gorgeous Ferrari Cabernet Sauvignon another red white which were less impressive
The choice quality of the 3 courses was very good, although the entrees tasted ordinary
2 waiters served us during the evening which wasn't the best: one leaving a bottle on the table, one taking it away/both asking same questions
In Scotland this deal could never be offered as Scots would drink the cellars dry! We would definitely return to Cite as it was one of our highlights in NYC
Not to be missed!
I take exception to people saying it's too expensive
Considering what you get, it's a bargain
Three-course dinner - off the complete menu - no prix fixe meager selection, with unlimited wine, for two is $140
When we go elsewhere, a mediocre bottle of wine may be $70
Add two glasses of champagne with the appetizers, and the bar bill itself is over $80
We've have paid much more at other restaurants for less food and wine
So, if your wine bill generally exceeds your food bill, this is the place to be
We have brought friends on numerous occasions, who then went on to bring their friends
So they must have been impressed
Cite is always crowded whenever I go, no matter what time it is, so I make reservations and am seated fairly promptly when I arrive
The food is decent and I enjoy trying the variety of wines that is offered with the prix fix dinners
Overall, pretty good place to dine occassionally
The wine dinner is incredible- prepare to eat drink and be merry with a date or group
Any app, etree and dessert from the menu and all the wine and or champagne you can drink- I am amazed people eat anywhere else! The food is great- try the Cite salad or crab cakes for an app, filet mignon or tuna for an entree and any of the desserts- it is all included- this deal is truly even better than it sounds
I don't dine out at upscale places too much, so I expected top service and food at this place and was let down
Restaurant Week menu was pretty standard
Salmon, pork chops or pasta
Portions are huge but taste was bland
My colleague like the cheesecake though
I would not go back
The prix fixe after 8 PM is the way to go if you want an appetizer (we had the corn chowder), a piece of meat cooked to order (try the veal chop - medium rare) and unlimited wine (Tatainger, Simi Chard, Matanzas Creek Merlot of '97 Meyney were the beverages on tap last night)! No wonder this place is thronged with hungry people with unquenchable thirsts
Ask for a table away from the main thru-way
We went during Restaurant Week
The sweet corn, leeks, bacon and potato chowder was really good
The pork chop was too overdone and the bed of sauerkraut it came on was too sweet
Service was fast and friendly, though the tables were situated to close to each other
Pul-lease! This place is nice, but very pricey
It SCREAMS expense account - and hey, if the company is paying - go ahead and enjoy
My grilled tuna was good - but certainly not the best I've ever had
My colleague's grilled steak frites looked very nice
Beverages (alcoholic or not) add up your tab here as well, so again I say, EXPENSE ACCOUNT
Bringing a large group on a busy Saturday night ,I was afraid quality of food and service might not be up to par, but we were seated promptly and the service by our waitress was fantastic considering how busy it was
The lobster shrimp appetizer may have been the best I've ever had ,you have to see it to believe it
Plus huge slabs of steak cooked to perfection
I look forward to returning
Service was uncommonly friendly for midtown
The waitress recommended a wine that all, except my mother loved
The waitress ordered a separate drink on the house for my mother
Nice touch
For appetizers, we had a bisque, salad, a lobster and shrimp cocktail and crabcakes
The crab cakes were ordinary
Everything else was very good
For the main meal we had seared tuna, salmon, and lamb
Three winners, especially the salmon
For desert, we had a creme brulee, praline tart, some chocolate cake w/ ice cream and a rootbeer float
The creme brulee and root beerfloat were ordinary, but the other deserts were outstanding
Overall, we were all happy with the food, though we wouldn't characterize it as being consistent
Considering the quality of food, we were pleasantly surprised upon receiving the check
For the food and the service that you get, and the midtown location, the price is reasonable
I've been to Cite about a couple of dozen times for lunch throughout the last 5 years
Rarely has it disappointed me
Ignoring price (I always charge to expense account), this place offers the best service, atmosphere, and filet mignon in NYC (the best filet I've ever had was at John Thomas steakhouse in Ithaca, NY)
Make sure you ask for center cut filet (I prefer medium rare), otherwise you may wind up getting a huge piece of fat with a small piece of meat attached thereto
The fries are great too
In fact, the menu lists fries with a side of filet
Recently went to NYC with 3 friends from the UK
Booked the wine dinner in advance at $60 per person
Service, food, wine and atmosphere was excellent
Very good value for money
Would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting NYC
Need to book in advance though for Saturday night
This used to be my Prime Rib joint of choice
Admittedly, the crabcakes sucked worse than Mrs
Paul's frozen seafood and the other cuts of meat were disappointing, with the only acceptable appetizers being the corn chowder and the gravlax
But the Prime Rib au jus was always the best and the sides were decent
Lately, however, it's been going down the tubes, what with early closings (arrived one non-major-holiday Sunday at 9pm and the place was shuttered!!!) and so-so meat
Service was always great but without good food, it's a losing proposition
Pity
This is one of my favorite spots to take newbies to
it's great for a huge group of ten (just call ahead) or dinner for two
I've only done the wine dinner and will never do anything different
it's by far the best bang for your buck - especially if you enjoy LOTS of wine and champagne -- it's bottomless cups of about 5 different types for the duration of your whole experience
The food is absolutely amazing! I've always had steak there and have never been disappointed! I'll keep on going back there - everytime I meet someone who hasn't checked it out!
I suppose this review will be unique in that I did not go for the wine
I went early, to beat the crowd, and not feel hungry during a show
The staff had a certain quiet before the storm look that, I assume, was a mental preparation for the impending onslaught of customers
They were friendly and colloquial (perhaps too colloquial for the prices)
Regardless the food was excellent - the crab cakes hearty and the tuna au poive perfect
In addition the wine list was diverse, both in region and price
The dessert of sorbet and fruit was augmented by descent port, complements of our waiter
This is a great bakery
The authentic japanese mochi are perfect
They are also healthy because they are made with fruit and gelatins
It is worth a trip just to look at how beautiful they look
The Scene Everything is lighter at the newly refurbished Sea Grill: the fabrics, colors, food, even the prices
This is one of New York's fabled dining rooms, facing the golden sculpture of Prometheus atop Rockefeller Center's winter ice rink
In summer, choice seats are set outside
For a major tourist destination, the dining room does not feel all that touristy, especially in the evening when the lights soften and the pace eases
The Food Chef Edward Brown is a fervent minimalist when it comes to seafood

They were also knowledgeable and made great wine reccomendations
We will definetly be back!
I've been to NAM twice, and both times the food was delightful
However, the music is a bit too loud and it can be difficult to have a conversation
The waitstaff is friendly but butts in, brings new dishes before we're finished with the old ones, and is hard to find when we want the check
Nevertheless, this is quite a delightful place and I intend to go back again
Great food and great value - the food was fun, different, and quite tasty and when the check arrived it was a pleasure
An elegant room with great lighting and style
Its a good alternative for those scared of Ctown dives
But didn't the designer go downstairs to the bathroom? It was is if they ran out of money abd left a saloon's restroom in the basement, and I can tell the cleaning staff hadn't ventured there in some time
The manager/maitre'd was pleasant and efficient, Unfortunately, our waiter could not have been less interested in his job or the experience of his guests
Stick with the cocktails (the lychee martini and the NAM cocktail were both good), but the wine list is innapropriate for the cuisine - bad choices across the board
The food was wonderful, with clean, bright, and focused flavors
It is some of the best Vietnamese in town
For the money you pay and the ambience and service you get, Nam is one of the best deals in town
The food is very good, with certain unique dishes (such as the shrimp dumplings)
Some dishes have a Chinese take-out style about them, however
The wine list is small, but adequate for the food - stick to the whites
Cocktails should be avoided
Definitely worth a visit
An otherwise fine meal was trashed when i realized that the dish i had ordered contained chicked, despite my asking for no chicken, no pork twice
OK, so anyone can make a mistake, but it would've been nice to have it comped and to not have the waiter ask me do you want to take that home?  tacky: service, and the manager had worse attitude
like their food is good enough for them to affect attitude
Went to Nam last night
Didn't understand poor service ratings from other respondents
Our waiter was sufficiently good
Food was decent
Red snapper was good
However, this food can be had in Chinatown for a lower price
If atmosphere is more important to you, check this place out
If not, save your money and goto greasy outposts in Chinatown
Nam is a great place for tasty food that won't set you back
2 people can easily have 2-3 appetizers, 2 entrees and a bottle of wine for under $100
I wouldn't go for the tasting menu because that is not what they are best for
Focus on their regular menu and you can't go wrong
Eat family style
You'll have a really nice meal for a very good price, and the atmosphere is really nice too
We'll definitely go back
I'd skip the desserts, they don't warrant the high price tag
You're best off getting another entree
Definitely worth the visit
AMAZING food, great service, can be crowded so make a reservation, but great wine list, fabulous food and great deserts for a great price
an amazing find in tribeca
We had an amazing experience with a large party
The staff was attentive and prompt
We did the prix fixe which was well worth the money
$35 which included more then enough appetizers and entrees
(Does not include dessert) Nam offers some of the best Vietnamese food that NYC has to offer!
If you don't know asian food, than you would probably think this place was gourmet
this place is mediocre at best
And not to mention the rude waiter that deliberately kept kicking my chair as he walked by, and instead of apologizing, had the nerve to tell me to move my chair in
when I was sandwiched in as it was
I give it a 4, because our waiter was great
I came here with a medium-sized group, and we opted for the tasting menu
although the food was well-prepared, it was not worth the price, especially when it does not include dessert! Poor accoustics and lackluster ambience
The service was terrific, with a great wine list
The fish was perfectly done, with a wonderful light sauce
My girlfriend and I were visiting NYC and this was by far the best restaurant we ate at! The food was delicious, the service was great, and the decor was very hip
I highly recommend ordering multiple appetizers and make sure to try the ravioli with fresh basil
For the main course, we had a spicy beef dish that was great
We have already recommended this restaurant to all our NYC friends
The food was great and so was the service
Good for dinner with friends
It was a great pleasure to drop in at NAM the other night
Perfect atmosphere
friendly service
excellent food
The dishes were awfully economical
yet surprisingly delicious
The bo dia rolls (filled with shrimp, jicama, and sweet sausage) were heavenly
The desserts were just amazing as well
I'll be sure to stop by again soon!
Pleasant atmosphere and reasonable prices compliment the menu nicely
Although I don't think that the menu is hardcore Vietnamese, as it boasts items remeniscent of Indian and Thai cuisine
The shrimp appetizer, wrapped around sugarcane, was good
The striped bass, which was the seasonal equivalent of the sea bass, was delicious
Beginningof May I reserved, a week ahead a table of four and when we arrived on time we got offered the table in the corner next to the entrance - the worst of the entire restaurant
Only after insisting several times we got offered a better table, one of the many free
Food was mediocre and also the portions
although we all are gourmet eaters rather than king-size gobblers
The wines by the glass were limited and not good proposals
The check landed on our table the moment we haddecided to ask for the desert
We paid and left without enthusiasm
Can't really recommend it
It's not bad but surely not a favorite pick for being so loud, crowded (tables are very closely placed) and not particular in anything than the wall decorations
The food was good
I think the red snapper is probably the best item on the menu
The other dishes my party and I tasted were pretty much like takeout food
The atmosphere is nice but the clientele is ok
The best Vietnamese food in New York
ok, that's not saying so much
But at least the city now has a half-way decent place to experience this wonderful cuisine
Anyone thinking of starting a Vietnamese place should head over to San Francisco and make a reservation at the Slanted Door, probably one of the best restaurants in the city
In general, the dishes at Nam were well prepared
Try the braised beef with green beans and yams--nicely spiced and tender
The shrimp and beef in black pepper sauce could have used a little more bite, plus the beef was a little too dried out
Appetizers faired much better
Try the monkfish and dumplings
Service was very good, even though the place was packed to the gils with people
It's also a place where you'll want to have your earplugs

Also, believe it or not, steaks at the Great Neck location are a lot more tasty, and it's easier to get a reservation with them
I never mind paying the price for quality food, but I am totally done with them and will never go back again
Steak, Steak or Steak
Service is okay
We had to wait 45 minutes past our reservation time, with standing room only
so bring comfortable shoes
I don't think that it is with the hype
These people are rude over the phone
Total turn-off when I tried to make a reservation
I called the restaurant asking for a reservation and the lady I was speaking with was incredibly rude
I was quoted the only times on a weeknight 3 weeks in advance was before 3:45pm or after 9:45pm
She then got really annoyed at me when I asked if she could check on another date and time and then proceeded to hang up
They may get great business and have good food but I suppose they will never get my business nor my friends' especially if they won't even bother being nice to me when I tried to make some reservations!
I went to Lugers several years ago
Didn't think much of it so I decided to try it again
Had a reservation 6 weeks in advanced
Still couldn't get the time I requested of 6 on a Sunday but I got 745
Told the idiot, I had only 6 people
He said thanks since he was overbooked
Waited an hour before he gives me a table for 4
Waited another 30 minutes
Now the crowds are gone
We sit for dinner and shortly after a group who didn't even have reservations were sitting next to us
Dinner was fine, nothing special
I did see a heavyweight boxer and another customer give money and get seated right away
I still love Ruth Chris as the best steak house in NJ
The one in NY taste different
Trust me I tried them all in NY/NJ/CT
Peter Luger's is a must for any steak lover and is a one-of-a-kind experience
Yes, this place is old school and loud and doesn't have the ambiance of other upscale steakhouses (Morton's, etc), but that is ok--it's all about the food here
Appetizers were great--wonderful sliced tomatoes and onions, and the best bacon you'll ever eat (1/4 of a inch thick!)
We had the steak for 2 prepared medium and it was perfect with all the juices and butter
Sides were also great, some of the best fried potatoes I've ever had and good creamed spinich
Bill came to $125 after tax and tip for 2 of us (we didn't have any drinks)
Luger's is as old school as they come and the food is great
Don't take these reviewers word for it, it's a place you must check out for yourself
I had been looking forward to trying Peter Luger and made reservations a month in advance, I was totally dissapointed - there are so many better steakhouses
The steak is good (allthough too buttery for my taste) and the ambience was terrible
The restaurant is loud, the tables are wooden and the service is OK
I am shocked at how much hype there is for this restaurant
I was expecting a steakhouse of the same calibre as Mortons or Ruth Chris - it is not in the same league at all
The waitstaff seem to be nicer to big groups of families or big groups of men dining together
(Groups) A woman dining alone? I couple? The service drops so many levels
I used to reserve a week or two ahead for dinner, and now they are telling me 2 months
They are either LYING, because they can't possibly be THAT booked
OR, it's WAY too hyped up
Rude, but I still go when I crave the good steak
I came here for dinner
If found both the decor and staff to be pleasant
I don't know what people are complaining about in that respect
The steak, however, is disappointing
It is a decent looking slab of beef, but once you bite into it, you discover that the meat is sparsely arranged between a network of veins and fat
The pieces you can actually chew are quite tasty and tender, however
The spinach is very good
Overall, however, BLT steakhouse is incomparably better
I am not making the trip out to Brooklyn again
After hearing all the hype about Peter Lugers, I decided to venture outside Manhattan and try it
I should have stayed in Manhattan and eaten anywhere
The steak had no flavor and full of fat
I don't know who keeps brain washing people to think this is the best steak in NYC but don't waste your time
For the price there are 50 better steakhouses in NYC
This place is insanely over rated and I was very disappointed
The staff was beyond rude; they made you feel very uncomfortable, and made it out as if we were doing them a favor! I am not a picky person at all, but this place is just ridiculous- you feel as if you are sitting in a cafeteria, and herded in like cattle- can they make it any brighter is this dump? Maybe if you turned down the lights you could camouflage the sterile decor
We actually got up and left because we decided it was not worth the price or our time
This place is Amateur hour for steak eaters- there are far better steak houses in NYC- I cant see how this place has survived over 100 years- forget it, never going back
Had reservervations for 3, and we didn't even bother waiting for our drinks before walking out
The resteraunt it's self feels like a highschool cafeteria
You walk in and feel like you have a spot-light in your face the whole time
Perhaps this annoyance also effects the staff, which would explain the absolutely HORRIBLE service we encountered
Seriously, don't even bother with this place
If youre looking for the absolute best tasting steak
This is the place
If you are a cry baby about ambience, and the kindness of your waiter
go to the Outback Steakhouse or Charlie Browns
I lived in argentina, best beef in the world by far, so I know what i am talking about
The meat here is fairly tender, but has taste (NO TASTE)
And my friend's steak was filled with fat and veins
Service was so-so
This place is a tourist trap, period
I really don't want to be rude, but anyone who goes to this place and pays those exorbitant prices for a mediocre steak is a sucker (including me!)
My old boyfriend was a bookie and in investment banker and a biker
he loved this restaurant, had his own card, and took me and friends there for special occasions
In fact, every occasion was special at Peter Lugar steakhouse
i must disagree with the poll on romanticism
What could be more romantic than an almost Camelot like atmosphere in a hustling bustling riotous home for superb, traditional food? The tables are old and scarred from the knives used for steak, and of course Micahel Z, would spin hispocket dagger out into the table
i like my steak and men big big, and i love classic rock and roll, and Peter Lugar's is my favorite restaurant in all the world
Make sure you go to the one in Brooklyn for the best experience
Best steak i have ever tasted in my life, the side dishes are amazing as well as the bread basket they put out that could be a meal in its self
Don't ask for a menu or you will be looked at funny
Its steak for 1,2,3
how ever many you are
And the bartender makes a strong drink
Also the bacon is out of this world
Service: Below Average, the staff joked stood around in the dinning room joking around with each other
Our waiter was very rude and only visited the table twice and we were forced to ask another waiter for drink refills
Food: A plate of potatoes $10
95! Four tomato and onion slices $10
95! The steak for two was very large, but did not melt in your mouth
A significant portion of the strip side was very tough
The steak is brought to the table soaked in grease

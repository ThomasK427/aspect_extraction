Generally I prefer smaller rather than larger portions but this throwback to the nouvelle cuisine of the 80s was ridiculous
I found the service to be pretentious and unwelcoming
With so many other great restaurants in NY why choose Fleur de Sel?
This is the perfect French restaurant
Cozy, fine French food that's done properly, good service, reasonable prices
My favorite dishes here are the chestnut soup and the crispy poussin
The poussin in particular, my goodness, I've never tasted poultry like that, it's so succulent and tasty and the skin is perfectly crisp
The prices are extremely reasonable for what you're getting
The location is very central
Chef Cyril does a great job of making this cozy little nook of a restaurant very personalized, the artwork on the walls, the business card and the menu art feature his watercolors
Service is very attentive
I've always had a great experience at this place
We celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary at this little gem in Gramery Park
It is a cozy, classy place with a world-class menu
It's a bit expensive but once you've tasted anything you'll know why instantly
The wines are superb, go for the lobster salad with black truffle sauce or the layered quail pat for appetizer
For the entree, the sea scallops with foamed dressing and the thinly-sliced pork chops with coffee sugar-cane glazed
For dessert, the banana mousse is heavenly
Just FANTASTIC
We had the 6 course tasting menu for $87/pp excluding wine
The best dish was their Lobster Salad appetizer
The rest was nothing to brag about
We have eaten at many $$$-$$$$ restaurants that for the same value, their food and presentation was average and not worth the return visit
NYC has many top notch restaurants and meals to offer
We love fine dining and I would definitely not recommend this restaurant
Very disappointed
This is the best dining experience we have in the last 3 years (which include weeks spent in Europe
) We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing, and was amazed at the quality of the wine in particular
The food was in small portions (luckily!) but extremely delicious
Presentation is also outstanding
The staff is very friendly and attentive
I went to a Michelin one-star restaurant in France before, and Fleur de Sel clearly surpases that experience in both food, wine and service quality
They deserve Michelin two stars in my humble opinion!
Nice, romantic place
If you want to impress your date then this is a place to go: Nice decor, soft music, quiet atmosphere, Bernardaud china
We both had the tasting menu wherein each course for the most part came with two options
I chose the ones my date didn't so we ended up tasting all
Every dish was superb and the entire meal was adequately filling
Just be prepared to shell out the big bucks
maybe it was the menu for that particular evening but it was either the pre-fixe menu or the tasting menu
My wife and I, with four colleagues, enjoyed a wonderful meal at Fleur De Sel
Each main course sampled (we are all sharers) inspired frank envy in some member of our party
This complex roundelay stopped however at the confit of veal
We all agreed it is one of the great dishes, a marvel of concentrated richness and flavour, by turns earthy, unctuous, sweet, salt, but always miraculously tender
There were notable appetizers as well: lobster salad, seared foie, little goat cheese dumplings with caviar
The service was expert and supremely tactful and, what's more, witty
Our waiter in his descriptions used words like sumptuous, tisane, ne plus ultra, with the merest hint of a smile
It turned out he was riffing, having overhead a bit of our conversation on the poverty of today's vocabularies! We'd like to return often but it is a trifle cher
Perfect for special occasions
I ate dinner at Fleur de Sel with a group of friends and we were delighted by the entire experience
The service was gracious and friendly while professional and astute
The wine list was amazing
The food was incredible, the scallops with market tomatoes as well as the veal breast confit were two of the best entrees we had ever enjoyed
The desserts were to die for; the apple crepe was unbelievably delicious
I highly reckoned this restaurant to anyone looking for a perfect meal
This was once a special place to go to for Mr
Renaud's cuisine
I celebrated my wife's birthday not too long ago there and it seem that the cuisine has not moved foreward
very dissappointed
Hopefully it was just one night
We may have been in the wrong night
Not sure
My wife and friends were highly anticipating this night
We were reccomended by some colleagues of mine to go here
First and foremost, the service was a little confusing
We were seated around 6 ish and it was not that busy then
So we werent' sure why our servers seem confused
But oh well
the dishes we ordered (although mine was on the money) seem to be missing some flavor
We had the goatcheese ravioli and the dough were really 'mushy'
The 'caviar' seem a little bit off
The baby chicken as the waitress puts it was not cooked through
We spent a good decent amount of money
For four people with wine and food came to around $600!!! Yikes
well I guess we would try them again once we've saved up
just spectacular, our second times could not wait to share our experience
the tasting flowless as the service and the wine list just right will be back soon
Great food, great service
Highly recommended
Dress well
Wine selection somewhat pricey, although they have a lot to choose from
Took my wife for our anniversary
We came on a Monday night when the Burgundy wines were half price! What a deal! We found an EXCELLENT selection (we live in California wine country, so getting a nice foreign wine was great) and ordered the spring tasting menu
The highlight was the lobster dish (first course, can't remember specifics) and it was the best lobster I've ever had!! I've eaten lobster on 4 different continents and I could not believe how wonderful this was!  For an after dinner drink, my wife had a 40year old port, and I had a great armagnac, which closed out a wonderful meal
At $82 for the tasting, it was a bargain, especially considering the wine was half price!  The only drag was that we had to walk several blocks to catch a cab after eating
The overall experience was really lovely
Some things stuck out even more than the great food and service
Our reservations were for 6pm, when we arrived we were told that we had to wait because they had not finished their staff meeting yet
The wait staff were incredibly attentive, though as a warning, if you like wine, but also a little privacy, this might not be a good idea, since they have the tendency to hover a bit
The courses came out smoothly and with perfect timing, and the dishes themselves were to die for, as well as beautifully presented, like every thing else in the small restaurant
They left you breathless to say the least, as did the check though
A great experience, though I wouldn't make a habit out of it
Though the service was impeccable, I wouldn't give them too many points for amiability
I've enjoyed all NYC's best restaurants (a number of times)
If you allow the chef to let loose here and bring whatever he chooses, along with the well-paired wines, you will be well-satisfied
The many pleasures of fine dining don't get any better than this


and without pretense or prissiness, too! many thank to the whole staff
I asked my girlfriend to married me

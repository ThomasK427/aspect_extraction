Everything from the ambiance, service and food were truly amazing
To start with a must try is one of their cocktails
really creative
But the highlight of the night was by far the food
flavors balanced soo well and to my suprise not oily at all
My favorite items were the rack of lamb and the almond chicken
as long as they keep up the same standards i am a customer for life
GREAT INDIAN RESTAURANT WITH FULL BAR AND HIP NEW WORLD MUSIC
ITS A MUST GO
This new hip trendy restaurant serves up more than the ambiance
the food is absolutely amazing
The cocktail menu is sooooooooo cool
must try the Yuva Masti
Friendly knowledgable staff
A must try for Indian foodies!
They sandwiches are meticulous and delicious
The place is always clean and the service is always super fast
I can't recommend Lenny's enough! My top three, in order, are the #1, #2, #5
Best Deli Sandwich in the city
The meat is shaved paper thin right in front of you
It is the best sandwich NYC
(and the girl at the register is hot!) Best value in the city
Always get your order right, great salad bar, the best sandwiches in NYC
The 48th Street location is perfect during the week, and the other places all around the city are great for weekends
Their delivery guys are great, always bring change and the orders are always correct
Highly Recommended
Best deli in NYC! Food is fresh and incredible, service was quick and friendly
As a health conscious female, a huge pastrami hero doesn't strike my fancy, but Lenny's has the most amazing healthy options, too! From the #11 Vegetarian Special to the made to order chopped salad bar - I could eat at Lenny's everyday and never get bored! It's also very nice to see your food being prepared right in front of you by all of the sweet Lenny's employees
So clean, so nice, so good!
On recent visits to NYC had many occassions to lunch @ Lenny's
Incredible sanwiches
Corned Beef best ever
Friendly waitstaff
Also recommended to corporate clients for catering and they were very satisfied
The service was as quick as could be with the food being made right infront of your eyes you saw the food was fresh
While the size of the place makes it hard to enjoy with large group its great for a quick meal or a cheap meal or a really well cooked meal
This is a great new place
The noodles and veggies are fresh and tasty
And they have an option of a vegetarian broth
The place also has a great ambience with a chinese 'diner' feel
Definitely wort a trip or two
just dont go in a big group
The sandwiches are really good: spicy, good quality meat, fresh baguettes, etc
These are just as delicious as Nicky's and other well-established banh mi shops in the city
The problem here is organization and speed of service
The other night I waited for over a half hour for a take-out order of 4 sandwiches
Someone else waited even longer for a smaller order
The food is worth it, but I suggest you order delivery, so that you don't have to read old issues of Robb Report while you wait forever in a small and hot room
Up there with the best bahn mi in the city
If you want the real deal, just ask for the #1 - be sure to ask for it spicy
This is one of the few places I've found that use proper french rolls
Sandwiches are about a buck more than at other places, but how can you really complain about a $4 sandwich
Another great sandwich can be found on 8th Ave and 43rd St
in Brooklyn
These places both beat any of the sandwiches I've had in chinatown in manhattan
Not that the manhattan ones are bad, these are just better
Some of the most unique and delicious drinks I've ever had
Definately try the fresh limeade and the Vietnamese eggcream
Hanco's sandwiches are fantastic! They just added a vegetarian version (Tofu sandwich) which is execellent! Also must try is their Bubble Teas which are their other specialty
Their Iced Vietnamese Coffee is Awesome too! Recommended if you are into sandwiches, Tea, and Coffee!
I tried the classic and grilled chicken with spicy and they were excellent! Best bubble tea drinks I had so far
Great food at reasonable prices
Very authentic cuisine, that hasn't been changed to suit the American palatte, so be carefull
The service is prompt friendly, but the place is such a hole the wall
If your looking for something different are willing to take a chance, go for it
If you get there don't like the look of the place, there are numerous other interesting asian places within a block or two
Along with stopping by for a brew, I have eaten here a number of times and cant give more praise to the chef, the management, and the staff
The tall and beautiful Madeleine has the compliment of the warmest personality and brings that personal touch to each and every customer
The bartender in the evenings makes everyone feel like a regular customer and watch out girls, along with being a great guy, he is a real looker
The food is the best of bistro fare, and never disappointing
Try any of the steak dishes for a perfect steak and fries experience
If to some the service isnt fast-food frenzied and friendly,  well this is a French establishment
If you want singsong wait staff --My name is Bonnie, and I am your waitress for the evening!, go to Ruby Tuesday or Red Lobster
But if you want good food that is worth waiting for, a dining experience, and French service by serious wait staff, this is the place to go
PS: Look out for the celebrities, they love this place
I should know (smile)
I've been here at least 10 times since it opened, and its always good
Steaks are just fine (not sure what the other writer was talking about
portions are American size (big), not French size
Mussels were good (not the best I've had
they need more garlic), burgers are fantastic
This place has the best, crispiest french fries around
Weekend brunch is a highlight -- fantastic french toast, omelets, and more
They could be more generous with the wine (typical 10+ per glass prices, but they are served in tiny glasses)
but, otherwise, one of my favorite new spots in the West Village since they moved back here
PS, service is great
People started recognizing me the second time back
love that
I've always walked by this restaurant hoping to try it out
it seemed to be laid back, relaxing, a real casual eat
Little did I know that upon dining at Les Deux Gamins, my entire dining experience would be marked by the unfriendly, inattentive, and unknowledgeable wait staff
It took our waitress 15 minutes to ask us for our order
When we tried calling her over to the table, we almost had to stare her down
When we asked her for recommendations, she seemed uninterested and unfamiliar with the dishes
And when we paid our bill, she rudely questioned our tip! To top it all off, the food was only decent
As a true Francophile, I come in with high expectations and usually leave satisfied
Needless to say, though, I won't be going back to this place
All it has going for it is its location
Don't be fooled - walk a little further down West 4th Street and you'll find the genuine dining experiences the Village is known for
Evening started out nice w/ complimentary glass of champagne, but turned sour as mussels were extremely overcooked, steak came in kid size portion smothered with sauce and owner recommended a wine special off the standard wine menu that was double the price of the most expensive bottle but made no effort to describe the wine as extremely special or significantly more expensive that what they typically serve

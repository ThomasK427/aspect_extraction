You don't have to break the bank to eat here either
You can have a very good meal for two people with wine for under $60
Every time I managed to make it to Mosto it was usually because there was a friend in town
I always bring them to Mosto because its a sure thing for positive praise
My husband and I decided to try it without our foreign entourage and I was not surprised when the food, service ambiance met our expectationsbig group or just a romantic evening with a special someoneMosto is a great place
The pasta (apart from the penne) is homemade
The cheese sauces are rich and hardyI recommend everyone to go there once
My wife use this place as our special place for two, but we can't resist bringing friends there too, or our daughter, or friends and family from out of town
The service is friendly, though not especially fast, the food is consistent from one visit to the next, and the wine list is solid and reasonably priced
Came here with buddies from out of town when Frank was crowded beyond belief
Bruschetta was good, spaghetti with clams was very good and pretty cheap
Serviceable and very affordable wine list
Service was slow, as food took almost an hour to prepare and bread was not refilled as they ran out
The place is very cozy and inviting
We love this wonderful restaurant
Cozy atmosphere, rustic, amazing food
Try the Carpacio di Manzo, breaded chicken breast with arugula and tomatoes, and the amazing chocolate trio desert
Delicious every time!
A friend of mine recommend me this East Village spot Mosto
I entered this cozy and green (full of plants) place and I felt already relaxed
We shared Grilled Calamari and the Piadina and then I ordered Spinach gnocchi
I travel a lot in Italy for my job and I found this restaurant so unique and real Italian !! But be ready because not every waiter can speak english
!  The best came at the end with an excellent chocolate dessert
Highly reccomended
mosto is all good UNTIL its time for the bill
don't pay in cash b/c they pocket your change! (we got unasked for shots in return for no change
) it's really odd b/c they ask you if you need money back after paying the bill then never ever return with your change (so, they give themselves massive tips)
Better pay with an AmEx (only card they take) or have exact change for the bill cause you won't be seeing any of your C

The food is decent, the atmosphere and staff are fantastic, the price is right
I'll keep returning again and again
This a great place for groups or couples
I've been going since it opened
I've met a lot of the staff and they are very accomodating
The food isn't the most outrageous I've had but it's great for the price and a cool place to go have a good meal and not spend a fortune
Mosto, miele grazie
I went to Mosto for the first time this past Friday night
I had a friend in town and I had hoped to take him to Frank, but of course there was a 40 minute wait
We were starving and so we wandered across the street and found Mosto
We were seated immediately and were treated very well by the wait staff
Our waiter was friendly and welcoming, and if not attentive, he had a good helper
The atmosphere in this place is amazing
It was a humid, rainy night and the combination of the candles, the thunder and the open air setting practically made me fall in love with my dinner companion! The food was very good and the price was quite reasonable
I will definitely go back for seconds!
First time in the history of my career in eating at retaurants, that I did not leave a tip
Waiter came over, took the order, and never came back
I was dying for something to drink, and had to get up from the table to obtain another waiter
Then I was overcharged on my bill, and ask for it to be corrected
When it wasn't, some guy (not our waiter) gave it back
My pen just uncontrollably wrote, NO TIP
You walk into this place and think that you are in for something special
ambience is really chill
The other three sister restaurants are much better
try Gradisca if you haven't already

skip this one
Needs to mature a lot
I love this place - whether you go in the middle of the week or at the weekend (when it's packed and you need to make a reservation), the service is always friendly and efficient, the atmosphere laid-back and trendy (but not ber-trendy) and the food superb
good place to start a friday night out, there's turntables in the corner, where the DJ puts on some funky (but unobtrusive) music to put you in the party mood
The reviews for Mosto made it sound great, good food and great atmosphere just like the old country
I took a friend visiting from out of town and we were less then impressed
The atmosphere is cozy with dried flowers and antiques and plenty of Italian accents--real or feigned
We went on a Saturday night with no reservations (they won't take them for parties of 2) and were seated in 20 minutes
The food however, may have been authentic at a third rate italian eatery but I wouldn't go back
We had grilled calamari which tasted like it had been sunning under a heat lamp a bit too long, gnocchi that was okay and a lamb ragu that was moderate
I was disappointed and if doing the East Village for Italian , I will stick to my favorite Il Bagatto
mosto is now booming
the warm atmosphere is welcoming, the italian waiters endearing, the food wonderful
really authentic experience with that extra something
Just as good as Frank and East Post, and right across the street
Had the most amazing ragu on special
Nice ambience, great food, service can be a little spotty at times though
We went here on the spur of the moment before a movie, and I have to say I wasn't very taken by the ambiance -- dark, even though it was half in the open daylight and overcrowded with tables and chairs, even though the place was far from full -- and the fact that the staff was grudging about seating without reservations
So my expectations weren't high
However, when the food came, instead of the tepid pseudo-Italian East Village swill I'd been expecting, all four of us received really spectacular meals
One of my friends had just returned from Italy and said eating here was just like a return trip
Melt-in-your-mouth gnocchi, deliciously al dente papardelle, luscious (and generous) servings of steak and seafood salad -- it was all good
Next time, maybe we'll make a reservation
The best soontofu that I know of
My friends and I crave it all the time
It's perfect for a rainy or cold day
They are also very good about refilling the appetizer dishes for the table
Come upstairs for great tofu soup - vegetarian if that's your preference, or get the kimchi soontofu with beef or pork
It's an amazing experience - friends from out of town speak of it longingly
The rest of the food is fine, they have the standard korean bbq setup, but the soup is what sets them apart
The restaurant gets cold up front in the wintertime, so if you go in winter, head to the back of the restaurant
This is always a pit stop when I meet friends for gallery treks and shopping in SOHO
The place is a circus when you try to get in line for something but you won't regret their choices for a light lunch or pre-Angelika Films dinner
Tomato Parmesan soup is really flavorful and not Campbell's
The breads and desserts are delectable
Plus if you need to de-stress after a hectic elbow jostling shopping spree, alcohol is served here
Knock back a few Stella Artois
Latin Music adds to the urban vibe and it's a whole different era in here as you watch the world outside
Had the fresh grilled fish and it was great
Loved the desserts
Definately will go again
Everyone was so nice and friendly

Cendrillon is not trying for traditional strictness, so if you're looking for replication of your favorite dishes it's not the place, but my family has always loved their food
Who can say no to goat cheese in the bibingka? Not traditional, but so good, who cares? Prices reasonable for Soho
I like the hidden appeal of the place, being on Mercer St
--the back street of Broadway
Service is great and swift, and the food is really fresh and great
When we arrived, the hostess told us that only one table, right near the entrance, was available
(During our 90 minutes there, all the reserved tables remained empty
) The waitstaff was somewhat attentive, but slow and a bit icy
We had the beef tapa salad, the duck and the spare ribs; all were fair
The mango tart was tasty, but not worth $8
If you want true Filipino cuisine, go to Ihawan in Woodside, Queens: delicious, unpretentious and inexpensive
If Manhattan sophistication equals an unsatisfying and overpriced meal in a dining room where regulars are fawned over and newcomers are ignored, stick with Cendrillon
the best thing i can say about the restaurant is it has a casual decor
i agree with other reviewers: it's wannabe gourmet pilipino/fusion food, and the owner was dismissive and nasty (that's a kind description) to non-regulars
Yes it is a fusion
Doesn't taste like home
The price doesn't look like home either and it definitely is not worth it, although some food is pretty good
If anything, I recommend the Buko Pie
I was really disappointed with the menu
You have maybe 5 options for dinner but they carry like 200 different wines
Looks like some people are regulars because the owners were going around to every table talking to people except mine
weird
not your usual filipino restaurant
i don't know what pblopez is talking about, but cendrillon isn't authentic filipino
if you remember that, you might enjoy it for what it appears to be: fusion, integrating filipino cuisine with different flavors
overall the food we ordered (pancit luglug, chicken adobo, romy's ribs, lumpia shanghai, a bowl of green soup that resembles the polyjuice potion harry potter drank) was not screaming with taste
i enjoyed the chicken adobo (not your mama's!) with yellow rice and peanut sauce
the mashed taro/potato was flavorful
the best was dessert: the banana crepe and leche flan were delicious! also, we had a disgustingly adorable baby with us and the friendly waitstaff was attentive when water spilled and someone needed a high chair
also, i found the atmosphere to be calming, especially with white christmas lights behind curtains
Born in Manila and raised in DC, I've recently moved to this great city called the Big Apple
So, imagine my pleasant surprise to discover Cendrillon nestled in trendy Soho, serving up all the ethnic dishes my mother used to prepare me growing up
If you like Filipino food, you won't find many choices in New York
But, this warm and friendly place captures the flavor of the islands and brings it all the way to Gotham City in a way that'll bring joy to your tastebuds and a smile to your face
The food here is terrible
First of tall the menu selection was very sparse
After contemplating which of the whopping 5 entries that have we ordered Chicken Adobo thinking it should be one of the more popular items
I was very disappointed when we having a $18 tasteless dry chicken
The Chicken Inasal was just as bad
When we finished our meal we decided to give them another chance by ordering desert, Halo Halo
Typically this is great desert with ice shavings and mixed fruits
We simply got served a bowl of shaved ice
All I can say is just Imagine trying to eat ice for desert
I recommend you stay away from this resturant until they get better chefs
MY WIFE AND I JUST LOVE THIS FILIPINO RESTAURANT
MORE LIKE A FUSION
IT JUST THE BEST FILIPINO RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK CITY
ALTHOUGH NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOWS ABOUT IT
I GUESS, VERY MUCH KEPT A SECRET OR ELSE RESERVATION WOULD BE A MUST
LOVE THE KARE-KARE
LOVE THE MANILA CLAMS
TO DIE FOR WARM CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH PASSION FRUITS
ARE YOU DROOLING ALREADY
YOU SHOULD TRY THIS RESTAURANT
I've eaten at a gazillion NYC restaurants, and to date (15 yrs) I have still not found a spot that I love as much as Cendrillon
I have eaten here 30 times at least
The food is always highly satisfying -- tasty, fresh, and, most importantly, interesting
The adobo is brilliant, the fish specials are always yummy, the ribs are very flavorful, and the young coconut tart -- actually all of the desserts -- are a dream, so save room
Also, it is worth the price (completely reasonable, but not the Chinatown prices people sometimes expect for Asian cuisine)
I have been going to this place for the past 7 years
Should I say more? The food is delicate and well-researched, the decor warm and intimate, the lighting unique, the wine list very complete and the atmosphere stays family-like
They also support the arts (check the walls for rotating exhibits) and the foods of Asia (check the series of reknown guests Chefs)
Almost like a Tapas Restaurant
Great atmosphere
A little hard to find but great place
Owners/Managers are sweet and friendly
If you are looking for a great Asian Cuisine, this is a great place to be
I love their chicken adobo
Their spring rolls were good too
Hmmm
and the service is excellent
They don't have authentic Filipino food, but the way they prepare all their dishes (fusion) is impressive
Presentation is simple and that's the way I like it for this type of cuisine
ONE REQUEST: GREEN MANGO SHAKE!!!!
Food: Tasty pan-Asian/Filipino cuisine
Try my favorite, the trout wrapped in bamboo leaves
Service: a bit sub par
Our oh-so-chic waitress obstained from half the items on the menu (give me a break) so she couldn't make subjective recommendations
She also pretended to be Filipino but my Filipino friend who dined with me blew her cover
Decor: Nice trendy-rustic decore that fit well in the SoHo neighborhood
Bottom Line: Good dining experience
This would be a excellent place if the portions were larger
And lose the wanna-be waitress
Featured in a recent New Yorker Food Issue article, the nicely lit, faux-rustic place decorated with Asian artists' work has a laid-back, homey vibe; underneath lies a killer list of wines from great producers at excellent prices from all regions
When the owner/chef is in the kitchen the food is fresh and surprising -- a mix of Asian with American and French
On the times I've been there, many Filipinos where there, but it's definitely NOT a Filipino restaurant; more modern
Service is fair depending on server and the night
I went there to impress one of my friends about filipino hospitality and good food - and I must say that I failed to deliver in both aspects
The waitress was too narcissistically busy checking herself out
The food was exorbitantly priced for its BLAH taste, not to mention the slow service
AHHHH I should have gone to Elvie's! Mura na, mabilis na, mas masarap pa!
The Scene Tiny Pintxos bursts with energy
The single room seats 30 without much elbow room
Decor is rustic, from hanging utensils to terra cotta dishes and playful decoupage tabletops, and combines with the pleasant bustle to evoke a festive Iberian mood
New York streets seem foreign after a meal here
The Food Unlike many tapas restaurants in New York, Pintxos stays close to the Spanish ideal of simplicity
The Basque-style tapas showcase a single ingredient each--a dish of mixed olives, of Manchego cheese wedges, of chorizo--rather than the complex mini-entrees that pass for tapas elsewhere
This works because the ingredients and preparations are so perfect: creamy cod croquettes and bisquey stuffed mussels are marvelously satisfying, and the spicy imported chorizo alone is worth a visit
Entrees, including paella for two, blue-cheese-smothered filet mignon, and stuffed squid, are excellent, but not as purely enjoyable as the tapas

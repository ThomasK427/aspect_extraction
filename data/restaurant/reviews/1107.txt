Excellent Service
Oh and the Rose Drink is unreal - so delicious - Please try!
Two stars!!! Come on!! This is one of the best things to happen to NYC in years!!! The food, the decor, the atmosphere, every last detail was well thought out and executed
Did I mention the food? Outstanding! The main dining experience with the prix fixe menu was a dream
All the lovely little additions of palate cleansers and aperitifs was a lovely addition to the already perfect meal
The wine list was very eclectic and thorough and the service, outstanding
I have to go back and try the outer lounge next time
Oh yes, there will be many more next times for me and The Modern
I'm reviewing because I read the first crummy review, which was oddly
wrong
The space is gorgeous, uplifting
The food was fantastic - smaller portions which can be shared
EVERY dish, from appetizers to entrees to desserts, were unique and totally satisfying
Foie Gras was amazing and served with fresh toast
Lobster and artichoke soup was hearty and served with cool bits of lobster meat and artichoke on the side
Desserts like carpaccio of tropical fruits were utterly unique and really great
Service was spot-on
It's expensive but the expense is matched by the quality
I'm reluctant to go to expensive restaurants because so often you're paying for everything but the food
Not here
It's great
Somehow both romantic and casual
Lofty, glass and metal, smart
Before going to eat dinner at The Modern I read the one review posted here on CitySearch
All I can say is, I have no idea what that prior reviewer was talking about! I really enjoyed eating at The Modern and, I hope to go back again! The food was great, the service was excellent and the restaurant itself was lovely, quiet and comfortable
Honestly, what could be bad about eating great food while looking out onto The MoMAs sculpture garden?
Read good reviews about the Modern and everyone is SO wrong about this place
It's all about pretentious snobbery here
The place, along with the wait staff and fellow patrons, most miserable people I've ever met
I don't think I heard one laugh, except when I tasted the food
The tuna tasted just like it smelled, horrible
Lobster soup- no taste! And for the price, I could have ate better at the corner hot dog vendor, and actually tasted the food along with a sizable portion
I would never recommend this place
Even the seating is highly uncomfortable
The food, the service, the ambience, everything was excellent and I'm looking forward to going again
The Scene The sleek red, black, and gray room evokes Hong Kong chic, making it the sexiest space to hit Smith Street yet
Everyone worth watching is inside, though giant streetside windows offer excellent people-watching
The warm and gracious waitstaff immediately takes to the young, stylish crowd and adds to the comfortable, attitude-free atmosphere
The Food China meets France in a subtly fused menu with homemade touches that make the combination really work
From the meltingly delicate wrapping of rich foie gras dumplings to the balance of brine, heat, and crunch of deep-fried oysters with jalapeno, everything is shown great care by the kitchen
Hong Kong egg noodles with chunks of lobster in a decidedly Gallic butter cream sauce is the best blend of both worlds, but since one must choose sides, opt for the Peking duck with its sturdy yet paper-thin pancakes, crispy skin, and tender, lushly flavored meat
you maight love cold dumplings, especialy at summer time
me , i hated it, the center of the pork one was frozen,  salad was ok, wine was a little corcked
i liked the ice cream and the host
You cannot go wrong with this place
The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional
Always a nice crowd, but never loud
Go here
Good for dates or with friends
Horrible
We were seated and ignored by waitstaff
Restaurant was dirty and unkempt
Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar
When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic
Chance is a joke
Avoid at all costs
My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend
I found the food to be outstanding, particulary the salmon dish I had
I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world
My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the dim sum, which was good
not outstanding, but good
We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there
Overall, excellent restaurant!
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street
We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura
And they provided a delicious dessert on the house! Definitely not a restaurant to skip!
Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken
But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get
I had the mango chicken and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful
Please if your thinking about it go, and stay the wait you won't be disappointed
I have visited Chance since it opened, last time at the end of February, and got the best service in the bar area, period
Of couse because I like the food and love the drinks I have always come back
And when my friends and I had RAW pork in a dumpling the helpful and friendly bartender tried her best to accomodate us (it was disgusting chewing on RAW pork!) while not making an idiot of the owner (No, he didn't even take it off the bill, so the bartender ended up paying for it to make us come back!)
I will never eat there again! Yuuk!
What's up with the guy at the door saying the wait is 10 minutes when in reality it is an hour? And the waitresses yelling at each other and looking angry? Drinks were mediocre and a friend of ours living in the area said they used to be great
Hmm
My wife liked the shrimp, but I got some undercooked pork and after complaining it still wasn't taken off the menu
Cool looking place, but the managment seems to have hubris or something
Toni I have been to Chance about 6 times since it opened
Each time the drink menu has had numerous interesting mixes
Last night we tried the chardonnay and the Pom Margarita
Both were perfect Friday evening relaxers
We had the brook trout, stuffed shrimp and spicy tuna appetizer
The chocolate souffle was as always - perfect
My husband and I have tried just about every restaurant on Smith St
This is the one we continually go back to
The food is clean and fresh tasting and, unlike some Asian food, you can distinguish the different flavors and ingredients used in each dish
Lunch is an incredible value
Make sure you try their banana eggrolls with homemade ice cream for dessert!!
15 bucks an entree and I have to wait 45 min, when the place is empty and there's no explanation why is taking so late for the food to arrive? Is the food that great that I'm willing to take that kind of abuse and pay for it? NO!!!   There's like 30/40 other restaurants on Smith St, if they don't value the costumer, good luck to them
Lovely place with the kind of Chinese food I like -- clean presentation, sizeable menu, and a bit of a French twist
Some of the best sesame prawns I've ever had
The bartrenress and waitresses are all friendly, caring
and totally on the ball
One of the best restaurants in the entire NYC area
The food is delicious
The prices are outrageously cheap
Parking is never a problem no matter how busy Smith is

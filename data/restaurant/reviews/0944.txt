I have been to every restaurant in NYC and have never been treated so rudely in my entire life
First of all, the food isn't that special
We had a couple of the pastas and none were particularly tasty
As a matter of fact, the spaghettini was foul, the red wine sauce did not match well
Then, after serving us a bloody steak, the chef refused to cook it a bit more, and the staff was rude about it
I do not know the point the chef was trying to make since her cooking needs work anyway
I would never go back and hope you head my advice and save your money
This hole-in-the-wall shop has the freshest cheeses, meats, breads, and greens I've ever had
It's hands down the best restaurant for authentic Italian sandwiches
There's only one guy working the whole place, and there's only one table inside
But you can take your sandwich to one of two parks, each within two blocks of the restaurant
It's a shame that more people haven't heard of this place because it's a hidden culinary treasure
Melampo serves the freshest mozzarella in the city- made right in the shop
Some customers were put off by the previous owner, Alessandro but he is a great guy
All the different breads are brought in fresh each day
The new owner is much friendlier and the sandwiches are equally as tasty
This is a must stop for any fresh mozzarella fan
There's also a great selection of authentic Italian cooking supplies and other groceries
In Short Owner Carl Provenzano opened this Murray Hill spot to fill a long-standing culinary gap: cheesesteaks
And while Carl's does the famed Philly version, with chopped beef, onions and your choice of Cheez Whiz or provolone, they also offer up a lesser-known Atlantic City version, this made with the same chopped beef and onion, but with American or provolone on a harder roll
Carb-phobes rejoice: there's a bread-free version for Atkins fanatics
SO
I'm from Philly
I've eaten tons of my share of steaks from Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's (which, quite frankly, is terrible
) But really the best steaks ever are at a tiny place in Manayunk and i can't remember the name
ANYWAY
Carl's is the best NYC has to offer
Not quite a Philly cheesesteak, but the best i've had here, and i've been searching NYC's cheesesteak scene for several years
The bread is fresh, i've never had a problem with the meat, and they replicate the atmosphere of a philly place
(this goes for the place in east midtown
i've never been in the one on chambers st
) greasy, good, get it with the whiz if u wanna be a true philadelphian
and no matter how Wogie's advertises their bar and cheesesteaks, don't be fooled
there is nothing philly about wogie's
If anyone ever finds an OUTSTANDING cheesesteak in NYC, let me know!!!
This may be the best in NYC but Philly has nothing to worry about
I had the opportunity to try this place 3 times and each time came away with the same thoughts, the meat was too dry and there was no flavor
I did notice this last visit that the steak was in a bin and was pre cooked
As the fry cooked needed more steak he added it to the grill from the bin and warmed it, which I'm sure contributes to the lack of flavor
Anytime I've had a cheese Steak in Philly at Geno's or Pat's I got something a little fresher
This will more than likely be my last time at this establishment
These New Yorkers have been fooled to think this is what a cheesesteak is suppose to taste like
I've had way better at a place in Atlanta, GA
Go to philly for the real thing
the only thing that carl has gotten right is the bread
Philly Cheesesteaks are hard to replicate
So far, I've sampled each and every cheesesteak place in NYC, and I've got to say that this is as close as it gets
Problem is that unless there is a crowd, the meat sits out too long
By too long, I mean, thats what makes the difference between this steak and what you'd find in Philly
The more people on the line, the better the Cheesesteaks are
It might not have that little extra something that is the Philly Cheeseteak - but its still very good
Make sure you get it with onions and Cheese whiz
Not even close to Philly cheesesteaks! They aren't horrible, but they let the meat sit too long and it congeals
My main issue is that they are WAY too salty
The bread is good, though
I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here unless I were hungover and needed greasy food
While Carl's sandwiches may look like a Philly cheesesteak, nothing about it tastes anything like one except for maybe the bread
The meat is subpar and dry, the onions are too large and overcooked, and they are skimpy on the cheese wiz
I say, if you want a real cheesesteak, then head to Philly
Carl's makes a decent steak sandwich
Nothing to write home about
Steve in Tudor is high to say it's better then Philly
The meat is too dry, they have a huge pile of meat on the grill and wedge you off a slab when you order
It's been sitting there all day though, it kinda looses it's umph
Overall I like the place, it's too small, so all steak shops are
For sure the best in New York, but that ain't saying much
We've got it better than Philly
Our NYC Carl's is better than can be found in Philadelphia--plus, our's is friendly and helpful
Delivery service great
I've lived in Philly and Wash, DC (where there are some cheesesteak outposts), nothing beats what Carl's offers right here in NYC
Want to get the first-rate, real experience: get The Works with Whiz and Mayo w/ extra SP
Signed, Steve in Tudor City
I've never had an authentic philly cheesesteak from philly, but I've had some bad cheesesteaks
The sandwiches here are pretty good; if you like cheesesteaks, I think you'll like these - greasy, lots of stringy meat with cheese and onions, on a good soft bun
The only thing I wish for is a little more distribution of the cheesewiz
As people mentioned, seating is tight - there's 2 tables only and a standing room only counter
The cheese steak itself is about $6
50
Afterwards, you feel pretty heavy, but that's what greasy food does to you
I grew up in Philly and consider myself an expert on the Philly cheesesteak
I've studied intensively at Pat's, Geno's and Jim's in Philadelphia (the 3 homes to the greatest cheesesteaks in the world)
Carl's is right there with them
The key is the roll and they've nailed it
The steak, onions and mushrooms are excellent as well
I recommend putting the wiz on top of the steak as opposed to below as Carl's does but it's great none the less
Little room to eat it but the service is energetic and quick
Highly recommended
Well, I have been to Pat's Steaks in Philly more than once (considered by many to be the best cheesesteak place in town), and Carl's Steaks are just as good! The bread is fresh, onions tasty, and the meat is juicy
The only downside is there really aren't enough seats to accomodate the customers
What will happen when this place really catches on? I made a special trip from Long Island and it was well worth it!
Best place to get something to eat that is filling after you have spent all your money drinking! The steaks arrive fast and hot! Service is fast and employees are very cool cats! You may even meet some girls that actually like to eat!   Strong recommendation! Cheers to the friendly and speedy staff!
I dont know how this place claims to have the best cheese steaks in NYC, I'd say they're average at best
When I think of a cheesesteak I want a big, sloppy, cheesy sandwich, which isn't what you get
However the bread is real fresh
Come on Carl, step it up a notch
I have become an addict of the Carl's Philly Cheese Steak
I never thought that Cheese Whiz, Steak and Onions could taste so good
The bread is perfect and while many people are turned off by the idea of Cheese Whiz on anything, I will say Don't knock it 'til you try it
Wherever Carl is and whoever he is, I shake his hand in the creation of the perfect lunch/dinner
Simply terrific!

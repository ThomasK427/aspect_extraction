The head chef is one of Mario Batali's sou's from Esca, and with another Batali restaurant manager as the owner, they have created a unique and classy Italian experience
The food is excellent and innovative
I had the best lamb I have ever tasted in my life here, and the veal was so moist that they actually carved it at the table with a SPOON! The wine list is 100% Italian, and their wine director is very knowledgable and will help you to make first class pairings
The Sunday family dinner menu is about the best deal in NYC for what you get
The desserts are amazing
pastry chef David Carmichael, yes you have seen him on Food Network, and he did Katie Kouric's good-bye cake
creates combinations that are unlike anything I have ever tasted
The Vanilla Bean Panacotta with cherries, and the Pachugo di Pistachio are just about the best things I have ever eaten
and then there is the Bumboloni! Unbelievable!   The service is so attentive and special
They will create your evening for you and design a menu especially for your party upon making a reservation if you request it
You can really just sit back and enjoy your evening
They are incredible
We thought the food was quite tasty
But these owners have taken the selection of micro greens far too seriously
I ordered this salad and was appalled to see a melon ball size salad placed carefully upon this over sized white plate
I then anticipated the taste of the taglitelle bolognese, and it appeared on an equally large plate and was a touch larger than the micro salad
The dessert was exactly the same
Ok, so American portions are too large anyway---but this took the opposite to a ridiculous level
We left hungry
Not worth the price in my opinion
A Lovely little restaurant with great food
Very knowledgeable and attentive staff
A great experience all around
Try it
you'll like it
We went to Abboccato for a Valentines day celebration
The food was delicious, and the atmosphere completely relaxing! We especially liked the option of getting a half-portion of pasta between our appetizer and entree
The staff was incredibly friendly
We'd highly recommend for special occasions
I went here a couple nights ago for restaurant week
1st of all, they HIDE the rest week menu
and when u ask for it, act like you are less than welcome-a step child to say the least
My salad: just lettuce with bitter lemony oil-Horrible
My entree: homemade pasta with meat sauce--mushy, NO taste
My dessert: Pommegranate panna cotta--no taste, VERY BORING
Service: so prentious, and the waiter was down right WEIRD
I will never go here again
From cocktails to coffee the service and attention we received was top notch
The table was available immediately and an attentive but not overbearing waitress served us
She was knowledgeable, polite, and efficient
We had an antipasta appetizer served with a selection of bread
We both had pasta dishesdelicious and beautifully presented
The portions were small to medium but plenty for us
Try it
You will not be disappointed
Everything from start to finish was excellent, and our server was outstanding
The lamb is soft as butter! They also served me one of the best martinis I have ever had
The friendly welcoming at the door was only the beginning to my evening at Abboccato, we were promptly seated at a lovely table and warmly greeted by our server soon after
The waiter we had was both friendly and helpful
She was full of knowledge about the wine and the menu and did not seem pushy
Everything we ordered was full of flavor and most of the dishes were very unique-nothing I've ever had at an Italian restaurant before
The dessert was oustanding, we had the chocolate pannetone and the riccotta torte the pannetone was rich and the torte was refreshing and lite
We will be visiting Abboccato again very soon!
The place is quite pretty
The antipasti was delicious--fennel and cucumber with sweet fig, some beets and grapes and two large lightly fried crab cakes
The pasta with mullet was delicious
The cheese selection was excellent
Mr
Livanos has done it again! Great food
It was so nice of Mr
Livanos to stop by the table
He did not know me
There luncheon for $22 is a steal
The dining room is beautiful and welcoming when you step down into it
The service all around was excellent with everyone being well informed concerning both the menu and service
The food was different, authentic and well portioned to enjoy a full three course meal
I was impressed with the presentation and the supportive suggestions from the staff
the welcome at the door is phony, the waiters were ok, but kept complaining about the owners while we were there,  the food was ordinary, the wine list money grabbing, and unoriginal do not go here
It seemed to me like the staff here felt that they were doing you a favor by serving you
The dining room is tiny, and there was more staff members than patrons the entire time we were there
The manager came over to check on us, but even he seemed insincere and unhappy to be there
The Scene Red Hook has always felt a little like the Wild West, and this spinoff of Manhattan's Chocolate Bar incorporates a modern lodge aesthetic
The walls are paneled with light wood and painted a rich brown
White subway tiles get orange grout, and a trippy deer-inspired "mirror" and brilliant chandelier frame the counter teaming with freshly baked goods
The Food Some stop by for a nicely foamed cup of cappuccino, a creamy hot chocolate or a robust cup of Gorilla coffee, but they're missing this quaint bakeshop's heavenly desserts
The moist cupcakes, topped with sweet icing, rival any of the city's name-dropped spots
A peek into the glassed-in bakery reveals freshly made cakes like the Red Hook Red Hot (a twist on the classic red velvet), or the resplendent malted chocolate cake
Slices are generously cut, and it's hard to go wrong with any cookie, brownie or cake
This was by far one of the best dates I've ever been on and I think everything played a part
The hostess was nice, my waitress was fabulous and the desserts were to die for
Great restaurant
Tasted their cake of the month and it was among the best cakes I have tried
Very, very good
It was a chocolate cake with caramel frosting and bits of sea salt (I think)
Nice combo
People were very friendly
If you are ever near Red Hook, go at once
I'm a local redhooker, and I go into Baked as much as possible
They have this chocolate krispi bar that is TOTALLY amazing--I mean seriously
Its the only desert that makes me happy (Its 2
50 and worth every penny!) I sometimes just sit in there and hang out with the locals, work on the internet, pick up a conversation with Nato (one of the owners), or whatever
Oh, and, I bought my boyfriend the malted chocolate cake for his birthday and we savored every slice--SO GOOD! And they have good coffee too!
I had read all the rave reviews and I was so excited to go try out this bakery
I bought a slice of the chocolate malt, devil's food, the little angel cake and one other I can't remember, but they were all awful
The cake fell apart like breadcrumbs once you took the first bite and the buttercream icing just tasted like butter slathered on the cake
I did really like the chocolate scotch pudding and the coffee was really good and the stuff was very nice
I really wanted to like the cake but I just wasn't impressed
I ordered a Diner Double Dark for a friend's birthday and it was wonderful
Not only was it super moist with frosting that was just right, the inscription and decorations were done beautifully
And they delivered it just when they said they would

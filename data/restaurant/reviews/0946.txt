Doesn't have the Queer Eye soundtrack booming at 85 decibels like Sea, and that's a good thing
Wait staff is friendly and quick
Not many people in the place
A nice little place to eat, not too many gimmicks
except for the plates
What is it with these trendy Thai places and: huge stoneware or oddly shaped stoneware?
Chai is great - good value for money, and great food
cosier than Sea
A very cozy place for thai, almost like a mini Sea without the wait or the hipsters
The prices are great and dinner was well liked by all
I hope they manage to stay in business -- they are surrounded by mega-restaurants
The Scene If Balthazar spawned a small child, it would look like Belleville, with its tin ceilings, tiny-tiled floors, bar back glittering with wine glasses, and enormous distressed mirrors scribbled with plats du jour
Although the environs are tres Francais, the crowd, with its briefcases and baby strollers, couldn't be more Park Slope
Casual, conversation-packed meals unfold easily, despite the shiftless service
The Food Bistro menus like Belleville's are the French equivalents of American diners'--they're homey and satisfying, but no one expects flawless food
Rustic dishes, like bracingly fresh fish soup with piquant rouille and rich, prune-stuffed pork terrine, fare better than upscale attempts, including well-cooked citrus shrimp with shaved fennel
Seasonings are intense: The grilled olive-caper-crusted tuna is balanced, but rotisserie organic lamb is studded with fresh garlic and oregano
Fondue, replete with bread cubes and steamed vegetables, is fun to share, but you'll want to horde the ice creams, particularly the creamy pistachio
so suprised that so many experienced bad service! i went to Belleville the other night for my birthday dinner with relatives
they were very accommodating beforehand, when I changed my reservation 3 times (oops!) and once we were there as well--totally wonderful to my decidedly unhip out-of-town relatives, which is a big thing to me, as I sometimes feel they are made to feel out of place in some of NYC's snootier places
our waiter noticed it was my bday w/o me saying, and brought me cake w/ candles
the food was very good, not extraordinary, per se--think the appetizers were better than my entree
french fries were AWESOME
the decor and nice atmosphere are more than enough to bring me back
really had a good experience, recommend it for all!
great food, friendly red-nosed waiters, and the nicest host I've seen in Park Slope
Too many babies and the place fills up with strollers during brunch
I was there on a saturday night and seated in 10 minutes
The brunch is okay but the dinner is worth a return
I don't get the AMEX thing either
I'd take a date there and go late, they place is empty by 10 on the weekend and the waiters are actually interested in their tables and it is a little romantic if you can get away from all the tables in the middle fo the place
The waiters used to be more attractive but it seems like they have really high turnover or a huge staff
cheers
I lived in park slope for over 9 years (and recently moved to LA) and Belleville was one of my regular, favorite spots
I have had everything from the soup to burgers to desserts and have never been disappointed (who the hell orders off of the kids menu?)
I would always go on hot, humid days just for the grapefruit sorbet (yummy!!) One of my last experiences there was with a friend of mine for my birthday brunch and when we ran into friends of ours (a couple) we sat and talked and shared a bottle of wine for hours on a sunday afternoon and we were treated with nothing but respect
I don't mind the bad reviews, it means it won't be awful and crowded with whiny losers when I come back for my visit!
New to the neighborhood and wanted to try out the beautiful bistro at 5th and 5th
We went on a Wednesday night to avoid the crowd and still managed to get very pushy service from a waiter who made us feel uncomfortable for not ordering enough (one entree each and we shared a salad)
The food took a little too long and was not worth the wait
To add insult to injury they wouln't accept my credit card, although they convinently had an ATM located in the restaurant (for a fee of course)
We had a wonderful dinner here the other night
After reading so many nasty reviews, we were hesitant, but since our experience, we plan on returning
Our server was friendly, prompt and helpful
He also was apologetic about any shortages and made a wonderful substitute suggestion
In regards to the previous complaint
Why order from the kids menu as an adult when there are so many other great things? Sounds like they were just cheap
The wine was great ( a $27 Cahor) as well as the bavawois? for dessert
Very enjoyable, and highly recommended
I went with my boyfriend at 4pm on a Sunday - and despite it being empty, the service was non-existent
I wanted soup and a kid's hamburger (I wasn't hungry enough for the $12 adult size, so the $8 for a mere 4oz seemed to make more sense), but the waitress claimed she'd be fired if she let me order a kid's meal
The beer taps were broken and there were only three bottle options, but two minutes later she forgot what we asked for
We weren't offered water, or asked if we wanted another beer
In fact, we didn't see our waitress again
After flagging down another waiter for the check, they only take AMEX, and incidentally, their ATM was broken, so we'd have to go across the street
There are too many good French restaurants in the area to waste your time and money at Belleville
With a reservation we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated in the tiny entryway; the bar was full and the only other option was to wait outside in the freezing cold
Our server seemed to be new because he continually had to go back to the kitchen to check on menu items
The food was okay, nothing spectacular
We will not go back, there are too many great places in Brooklyn to repeat this mediocre experience
I suppose I shouldn't complain about the price -- French food in general, especially in NYC, is expensive
It's because they put so many delicious things (read: butter, salt, fat, sugar -- the good stuff) in such small packages
Belleville fits the bill as the epitome of French dining
The white tablecloths covering closely-packed, old wood tables; waitresses with accents and up-turned noses; warm firelight ambience; boisterous crowds drinking wine -- it's all here
The food is fantastic, and overall, this is a great restaurant, but I tend to favor dining values, and I tend to find this restaurant a little over-priced
It's a lot like it's neighbor, A di La
Hrm, now that I think about it, they are probably foreign-foodie cousins
I went with some friends late on a weekend and couldn't have enjoyed the experience more
When they saw how much we were enjoying their french fries, they comped us another plate
I'll definitely go back
After reading the negative posts I can't say I was optimistic
To our great surprise we had a fantastic experience
Service, ambience, food and wine were very good
I was looking for something wrong but I couldn't find it
My chicken liver spatzle (a spl) over frizee was original and disappeared quickly
My short ribs (a spl) over mashed potato with a horseradish cream sc were excellent
The wine list affordable and our waiter recommended a wine I had asked about (perhaps one of the cheapest wines on the list) a cote de Rhone ($26)
He was great in not trying to over-sell
My friend's wife's escargots were classic and so the stuffed trout my friend had was moist and worked very well with the mushroom stuffing
We didn't have dessert so I can't comment but Belleville is def worth a try or in my case a repeat visit
If you don't mind waiting a hour for horrible food, this is the place to be
The waitress that we had just wondered around and was not attentive to us
The other waiter that was there provided good service to his tables
Plus, I don't understand why they only accept AMEX and cash
Not everyone has an AMEX
Most of all, it was too pricey for the garbage food that we ate
went there for sunday brunch after a wonderful massage - the food was terrible-bland/tasteless, cold, expensive
the service was better than the food
will not go there again
A group of 4 went there this past Saturday for dessert and after dinner drinks
They ran out of cheesecake so the guys, on the recommendation of the waitress, got the creme brulee (pear)
Disgusting! Tasted like eggs, no sweetness whatsoever
Desserts were priced at $6
00
The only good dessert and the reason why I thought there other sesserts should be of same quality was the chocolate torte
Stay away from everything else
$45 was spent for a horrible experience!
First of all, the staff must be reading these reviews, because they were exceptionally friendly, from the maitre'd to the waiter, and let us stay a bit later at the end of the night to finish dessert
The entrees were perfect
I had the yellow-fin tuna which was cooked 'black and blue', rare on the inside and crisp on the outside

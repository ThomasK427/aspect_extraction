Not surprisingly, the bill was promptly delivered when summoned
A complaint to the manager fell on deaf ears
The barbeque was mediocre and made less palatable by the lack of service
Take your chances with this place
and it isn't just tourists
The ribs just fall off, the sauces are great, and the corn bread kills
Great beer selection
And the split, grilled flat dogs make a perfect lunch meal
Why would anyone boil hot dogs?????? Even the bar service is reasonably quick and very friendly
Awesome BBQ
We had reservations at 8, but it was raining so we went early and were seated right away
Very crowded, but who would expect less in the middle of Times Sqare
Food was amazing in my opinion!
The best ribs, cornbread, potato salad greens that I've ever had in a restaurant
I've recommended Virgi's to everyone I know and will continue to do so
Good BBQ, And real good hot suace
This is also one of the few places where they have Abita beer
This is one of the best BBQ places I've been to in NY so far
There's one on 8th Street that's good too
We had a great seat on the second floor in a semi booth by the window that was the best seat in the house
We had BBQ hotdogs that were absolutely too delicious! The wait when we went (tuesday night) was 30-40mins but it was worth it! I would definately recommend to anyone
Wow! We love this place
After seeing that it was voted Best Barbecue on Citysearch, we checked it out and it's definately the best
We're from Texas and miss the barbecue there
At Virgil's we tried the ribs, the pulled pork and the chicken barbecue sandwhich, all were fantastic! We love this place ans it's right near the theaters
Dust off your County Fair bib, and a pair of trousers with an elastic waistband--cuz your gonna need em'
The food isn't what you'd call dainty, but it sure is delicious
From the Chicken Fried Steak--yes, lovers of all things chicken fired--to the Brisket Po' Boy, you will not be dissappointed
I have been there three times now and have licked my fingers clean every time
The decor is perhaps the most entertaing part of the Virgils experience
The place is a vertibale shrine to all things BBQ, including a map of the best BBQ's in the US which make a killer road-trip--figuratively, if not literally
Prompt and entertaining service, coupled with a respectable beer selection make this BBQ pit a real Hog Heaven!!!
There are a few hits and a couple of misses at Virgils but the barbeque wings are an all-time classic that can't be missed
The pulled pork and brisket are also excellent and I usually order the pulled pork sandwich with mustard slaw
The ribs are on the dry side -- personally, not to my taste -- but others may feel differently
There are a number of other dishes on the menu including chicken and fish, but in my humble opinion they have nothing to do with barbeque and (with the exception of trying them once) I've always avoided them
The sides are all very good as is the corn bread
Try the wings!
I like this place, but the last time I went the ribs were overcooked
It's the kind of thing that would happen when a place gets so successful they can't prepare the ribs using the time and care they need
Still a good place, and you have to try the hush puppies
Great BBQ Great Value for NYC--try the Pig Out, you won't go hungry


I'm from NC, and this is some of the best BBQ I've EVER had! Brother Jimmy's is a distant 2nd
They're a bit pricey, and can get crowded, but bring your appetite! The portions are huge, the food is always perfectly done
Lunch is usually not too crowded
Fast service since most BBQ is cooked in advance
Good beer menu
There is no better pulled pork in the Northeast! Please go and get the pig-out
You will not be sorry
Have been here several times and never been disappointed (or bored)with the food
Chicken is cooked perfectly-falling off the bones and still moist and juicy
BBQ is suculent and flavorful with just the right amount of smoke
Side items add good variety to platters
All this and reasonably priced AND right in mid town!
From shelling your own heap of shrimp for appetizers to delicious saucy ribs and yummy cobbler for dessert, I think this is the best BBQ joint in town!
I'm from North Carolina, but I have to admit, the pulled pork at Virgil's is better than the stuff in NC
This is by far the best barbecue in New York
I've tried Blue Smoke, but Danny Meyer's new joint just can't compare to Virgil's
maybe the only bbq in the city! But Virgil's was the first restaurant I ate at in NY and is still a favorite
There are so many hot new 'in' restaurants, this is just a great place to eat a lot and get messy!  The bar downstairs is a lot of fun, so if you get stuck waiting, just have drink
The best hush puppies with the most delicious honey butter! Don't miss the honey butter, it is as unforgettable as the baby back ribs
It's one of those place where you wish you had a bigger stomach
It was also a great place to have drinks while waiting for a table
The food is awesome, but watch out for the link sausage, if you don't like spicy hot food
The biscuits are great, but you mut want to ask for regular butter instead of the apple
The bbq is incredibly delicious
The service is very quick
On a Friday or Saturday, make reservations
due to the fact ny cannot do open pit bbq, bo bbq will ever be great here, but virgil's is the standout
I went in Virgils a few months ago and the restaurant set a new standard for me rating places to eat
Not only did the food taste so good, but the money was worth it
I always recommend it to people
This is a perfect place to go for any group
The food is great, its close to Times Square, and the staff is friendly
The location works out well for theatre-goers
It's a great place to go after a Broadway show for a decent meal
The food is good, but not great
Unlike others, I did not find the food to be overwhelming in terms of quantity
The place gets very very very crowded, and noisy which after a Broadway show can be burdening when you want to talk about the aftermath
Incredible!!! A friend suggested this place to me
It was everything and more of what she said
The service was good
Our food was delicious and delivered very quickly
The prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food we ate
I can't stress enough
You have to try this place
It will knock you over!!!
think you can't find good BBQ in NYC? think again! Virgil's has great, authentic southern style bbq
the menu is very extensive and offers something for everyone
I usually get the pulled pork sandwich and the meat is always very fresh, tasty and tender
and the bbq sauce they use is awesome!! you can order an app but you will be so full you won't eat your dinner
but either way you cant go wrong with Virgils!!
OK, I'm a Yankee, I don't know from authentic BBQ, fine, whatever
But Virgil's is great -- delicious and inexpensive for the overwhelmingly huge portions you get, no matter what you order -- ribs, sausage, shrimp
And where else in midtown even PRETENDS to be downhome, let alone serves edible food at fair prices? Sides--mashed, greens, biscuits--are also delish
In Short With strong Venetian influences, the restaurant offers an abundance of fish dishes, including branzino with cherry tomatoes, olives and potatoes; a seafood stew; and house-made trenette pasta with crab meat
Beyond fish, the restaurant serves such appealing dishes as calves' liver in veal sauce with polenta
The room is decorated in blue, green and yellow, with a balcony overlooking the main dining area

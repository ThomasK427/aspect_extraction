The stuffed porkchops were unbelieveably good! With the warm apples and walnuts, it was a such a fulfilling dish
Agave is great for all ages, and has great prices!
Had dinner at Agave Tuesday night - just before the NYT gave them ONE star
Agave has a gaurdian angel, one star was more than gererous


thank god there were cocktails to appease the headache of a menu and the series of bland and confused dishes that consistently fell short of yum!
although it's visually pleasing in an intimate setting, i was not impressed with the food
I was expecting incredible and unique dishes from the reviews I read but was disappointed with the actual taste
With a waitress recommendation, I tried the duck quesadilla flavored with mexican seasoning, but it tasted just like a Taco Bell
My husband had a steak, which he considered just average
However, the service and ambiance was enjoyable
I suppose I am spoiled, though, since I am from San Diego and just 20 miles from the mexican border
However, the southwestern food is not outstanding
I recently had my first experience with this restaurant and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised
I ordered the cinnamon, brioche french toast (Sunday brunch) - delightfully rich and sensuous - I would definitely recommend
The most remarkable trait of the place however was the service - warm, friendly and very attentive
;-)
good fingerfood, some inexpensive and expensive dishes, the food was well seasoned and hood tating margaritas
Excellent restaurant
The food is excellent and the servings are a good size
The decor is beautiful and the service is knowledgable and good
The drinks are great
The brunch is fun and lively
I have been back three times and will make it a regular spot
It was cold and wet night in January
I'll cut to the chase and let you know we were coddled and healed
We were embraced by the staff and attended to with great care
Having lived in this neighborhood 10 years ago we appreciated the transformation of this space into an upscale, COZY adobe style dining room
We indulged on a Southwest sampler appetizer which woke up the taste buds and I had the Dorado- a fresh light fish in a banana skin wrapper
EXCELLENT! The manager came over and introduced us to a 20 year old single barrel style Tequila which was dangerously too easy to drink
The dessert menu was one temptation after the next
I went for the creme brulee and savored every spoonful
We will be back soon
The Scene Combining early 20th-century style with contemporary design, Tenement pays homage to the neighborhood's original building stock with a decor rich in Victorian wall treatments, wrought iron and lots of fieldstone quarried from the building's original foundation
A vintage streetlight stands sentry at the base of an impressive staircase in the rear of the main floor leading up to a sky-lit cocktail lounge and down to the kitchen and private dining room
The small lounge behind the DJ booth beckons with a warm fireplace and soft banquettes
Service is attentive
The Food Tenement offers a clever, inviting menu of comfort food
Old-time Lower East Side fare includes as a tasty plate of potato pancakes or potato-and-cheese pierogies
There's also an incredibly succulent pork chop stuffed with sweet dried fruits and a hearty dish of mac and cheese
Waited an hour for the food to come out, couldnt even find the waitress
The manager finally got the food out but it was extremely uncooked
No appologies and nothing even comp'ed
The entree finally came back a second time and and was extremely overcooked
Waitress was rude
I ended up getting pizza around the corner
Avoid this place! Overpriced too
food is pretty eclectic and delicious
a nice place to check out if your in the mood for comfort food with a twist
the drinks they serve are pretty bad - watery and def
not top shelf liquor
the service is only so so and could be improved
the ambience during the weekends is absolutely terrible, especially saturday nights - check this place out during the week when there is no DJ pumping terrible club music and the bridge and tunnel/murray hill crowd are not around
wish they would find a new neighborhood to congregate
Went with a group of 7
Loved the atmosphere
Waitstaff was low-key and accommodating
The drinks were delicious (pomegranite moitos anyone?)
Food did not blow anyone's mind, but everyone seemed satisfied
My night began as usual
out of work and looking for a place to eat and possibly meet someone special
I cam across this lower east side gem on a whim
the attractive wait staff lured me in, but the enjoyment did not stop there! The provocative menu, the cozy garden, and the cathartic music (not to mention the hottie waiter) have kept me coming back each week
When you go and you are wondering what is good (besides everything), three words for ya
Lamb, Lamb, Lamb! I am a libra, I know what I'm talking about
This is my ace in the hole when I dont feel like blowing alot of $ on a date
Very relaxing place although the DJ plays music way too loud
That is overcome by the fantastic food and very very moderate prices
The perogi and potatoe pancake appetizers are so good you might think of converting to judaism
The bartender is pretty hot so if you are on a date dont let your girl catch you staring at the bartender
I have been here probably 10 times and havent had a bad meal yet
This place is very cute, cozy, and comfy to hang out with friends
I tried corn meal calamari that were as light and crispy as popcorn and my favorite one was grilled salmon
Delicious food with service that rocks, simply said - I LOVE THIS PLACE!
I went there on Saturday night just for few drinks
Our bartender was awful, she didnt smile a bit and was uncomfortable to sit there so we moved to a table were we were pleased with the service from the waitress
By the way the food is delicious and the duck breasts are the best and on top of all it is cheap
Last Thursday evening I dined with friends in the heart of L
E
S
at Tenement
We had not one complaint about the food
An ecclectic menu that was beautifully presented and delicious
The service was outstanding and sitting in the plush fireplace room in the back, we were so warm and cozy we never wanted to leave
I highly recommend Tenement for dinner or late night cocktails
(DJ said to begin at 9pm on weekends)
We had a horrible night here stemming from intolerable service, no appologies after our food never came out after waiting longer than an hour and a half, and a plate of crusty bread thrown at us when we asked for their signature corn bread
Needless to say we walked out
Went there the other night
Waited 45 minutes for appetizers, which came with profuse apologies for the time
Then another 45 minutes with no entree so we left
The table next to us did the same, but without paying
based on the reactions from the hostess and our waitress, I don't think this was normal, but it sure wasn't handled well
My dining companion and I have nothing but raves about the  environment and the Food
Both exceeded our expectations which I may add, tend to be very high
It was almost empty on the night we dined
I hope this was just an off night and not a sign that this great restaurant has lost it's cache' in the oh so fickle appetites of New Yorkers
Miserable service despite being one of only a few tables in the main dining area
Our party of 6 had to practically beg for drinks and water

Drinks were over-priced, and served in plastic cups
Recently had a party and was embarrassed by the whole experience
Not only was Anju's a mess when we walked in (boxes all over), the service was terrible
The price we agreed upon was not honored and I wound up paying a fortune for the worst night ever
The bartenders charged my friends when it was supposed to be open bar and worse yet, they charged everyone different prices for the same drinks! The beers were not even refrigerated
All my guests complained
Most unethical staff I have ever encountered
We booked a party at Anju and before the event the managers were very accomadating and great to work with
But, when we showed up for our party nothing was set-up, none of the correct food we ordered arrived, they didnt clean up our room as our guests finished their drinks, they gave us one abrtender for 75 people, the airconditioning was not turned on creating a sauna like experiece and the managers were rude and awful when we tried to talk to them
These people are horrible and do not deserve to get your business
Go some place else and don't be fooled
Hey guys, open bar from 10-11, but guess what
the doors open at 11:05
Drinks cost an average of $7 to $10 and are served watered down in plastic cups
The music was ok for a while, but then went off for a couple of minutes
The crowd was cool, but um
dont go here
Anju gives other Asian restaurant/bar owners a bad rep as money-grubbing bastards
A group of friends and I were on the guestlist for free cover btw 10-11pm
Doors opened at 10:45
The crowd is pretty diverse -- majority in their late 20's-early 30's
If you enjoy dancing to old, angry reggae rap, then more power (and years) to you
DJ didn't know how to spin
Also, the dance floor heats up like a sauna to sell you $4 bottles of water
Drinks are EXTREMELY weak
Bartenders screwed us over for not mentioning a 2-for-1 deal before 11pm ($10 per drink normally)
After we protested for overcharging us they gave an utterly ridiculous answer, oh that's only for drinks with vodka
Yeah, you charged someone else with an amaretto drink half-price
Some sketchy logic there
Don't waste your time and money at Anju; there are plenty of bars in the neighborhood
Although it's a very nice space, the food was terrible
They were out of several items on the menu, they forgot to add the beef in a beef dish that my friend ordered, and the drinks were disgusting and generally watered down
The waiter asked us several times after dinner whether we had paid our bill yet, and after we had, he came over to make sure that we hadn't just hidden it from him or something
Over-hyped and over-priced
Stay away
They ran out of box dinners at 9pm, and told us the BBQ shortribs were still frozen
No coffee, no wine list, no sake list
And these are on top of a very limited menu
Paid over $150 for 2, and the drinks weren't even strong
Services were slow rude
Go there for a drink, but not the food
I eat here all the time (sign up for their VIP card - it gets you 15% off)
The food here is consistently great - there are so many options on the regular menu and there are always a lot of specials to spice it up
They always throw in little surprises - bruschetta, cheese plate, chef's tasting, mini dessert plate
The service is impeccable, the garden is beautiful and they are always gracious hosts
I sometimes bring my (normally well-behaved) baby and on the occasion when he lost his temper, they didn't make us feel any less welcomed - they actually went out of there way to assure us that it wasn't a problem
Whoever wrote that bad review must either be a competitor restaurant or, no offense, must lack good taste
The service and food was great my wife had the Florentine Steak with tuscan fries which was probobly one of the best in the city, I had the branzini (Sea Bass from Italy ) The waiters also gave us some complimentary grappa and port wine on the house, This is definetly a must try place
We went with a large group of people to celebrate a birthday and we chose the restaurant since it had recieved such high ratings on city search
The food was barely edible - I had stuffed ravioli that was the consistency of rubber and my friend had the Salmon since this is her favorite fish - which was indedible
The service and surroundings couldn't have been better, but the food was very disapointing at best
What a great experience! The food was expertly prepared and presented
The staff was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly
Immediately we felt at home
We'll definitely be back!
The food was excellent and so was the service
I went there with my husband and the ambiance was just perfect for a nice romantic dinner
Our waiter was great and we even got drinks and some food courtesy of the cheff- maybe because it wasn't so busy when we went
We will definitely go back again, and this time we will be bringing friends
We had a wonderful dinner in a lovely, gracious room with great food and warm, attentive service
The lobster risotto and filet mignon were very nice
The cheese plate was terrific and the hospitality was generous
The prices are more than reasonable for the food and service quality
An elegant but not stuffy destination
As perfect for neighborhood dining as for out-of-towners
We moved into the area a year ago and I happened to try a few slices from the take out side, a little pricey, but very good
So I tell my wife about how good the pizza was, so we decide to order it one Friday night, I ask for it well done, and head over to pick it up, pay $23(yikes for 3 toppings), get it home and it tastes like they make the worst pizza in Queens
It was not well done, it wasn't even cooked, the crust underneath was wet like a sponge, and the cheese was barely cooked enough to melt it
We ended up putting each slice in the toaster to get it to where it should have been
By the way, it wasn't like this b/c I picked it up late, b/c they were boxing it as I showed up
OK, so we give Sac's another shot, and this time I told them that I wanted them to burn it, but the pizza was again completely under cooked
So that's it no more $25 pizzas from Sac's, they have lost me and anyone that will listen to me
Seroiusly we started to get Dominoes b/c it was better, but now there is a really good place on Crecent and 30th ave, called Taste of Italy, and it is worth every penny
Don't know what the guy below is talking about
everyone should read Sac's Pizza Place as well
People love this pizza and travel to eat it
A friend of mine just returned from a year in Italy and said Sacs Pizza was great
I normally do not get annoyed at reviews
everyone is entitled to their own opinion but this one was unjust
It sounds like overrated is just plain cheap
I had order pizza from here a few times and it was excellent so I decided to try out the restaurant part of Sac's
I went there twice and left with the same mixed emotions
The service was slow both times despite it being a very small sized restaurant
They do however have some great bread that you can snack on while you wait
The food was good both times but was vastly overpriced for a small Italian restaurant in Queens
The quality/quantity of food does not support the prices
Have probably tried a little of everything on their menu, and can't seem to find anything I don't like! Putanesca is amazing; Four Cheese Gnocci is like ma's; can't go wrong with their Mama's Meatballs or Sausage; fahgheddaboud the pizza! Potentially the best pizza I've ever tasted
And
when you call for delivery
they'll deliver beer, too
Beer delivery with your pizza? Heaven!! (If you dine-in, the owner will usually ALWAYS stop by to see how your meal was
He bought us dessert once! Huzzah!)
If you want to just grab a slice, enter the take-out area - the plain and sicilian slices are great, but the marinara is to die for
Or, if you're in the mood for a nice sit-down, enter the restaurant
The entrees are huge and great for sharing
They also have live music some nights, and a fireplace during cold winter evenings
Wineturtle lives up the block and can tell you that you can not get better slice pie in Queens! Now that they weny full service 5 years ago there is no reason to leavemy block
Wine by glass always 8 or more available and many organics also
Wine list has value in the mid;range prices

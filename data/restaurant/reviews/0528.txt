i can't believe we waited 3 full hours to be seated
for brunch! i was starving
even when they did send out some dollar sized pancakes to nibble on
the hostess was way off in her wait estimation
the banana walnut pancakes were actually very good, but the rest of the dishes are average
i heard the place was good, but i wouldn't wait 3 hours again for anything
don't go with more than 2 people
we had 4 and the 2 seaters went fast but the 4 tops took 3 hours
The blueberry pancakes are perhaps one of the best things I've ever eaten
My coffee was always full, and food came out fast
Waited an hour and 45 minutes for a table, and did so with a smile because I'd heard such good things
The hostess was darling and sweet and apologetic for the long wait, and the waitress was perfectly lovely
They sent out silver-dollar pancakes while we were on line outside, which is a nice touch and quite a teaser
If my hips could stand it, I'd eat those pancakes every Sunday for the rest of my life
The whole experience was delightful
This place is my favourite spot for brunch! The only thing is that you have to wait a long long time before having your table
Waitresses smile, service is fast, the food is amazing and the portions are huge! I tried the French toast and the pancakes, that are really excellent
Eggs Benedict are very good too
If don't want to wait too long and live in the neighbourhood, just try the take away option
as I've been told that It's such a great place for brunch
though It takes so long to have a table but it's so worth it! try spanish scramble and pancake! the best thing is salmon egg benedict! I'm so happy to find a good place on clinton st
Decent spot to grab some breakfast/brunch
Very small space so don't arrive too late
Having food allergies I am somewhat limited to choices
I must say the pancakes looked VERY good
I would stick to standards like pancakes, waffles etc
Egg dishes are kind of standard - nothing to rave about
The atmosphere was your typical LES crowd musing over their difficult lives while clutching gucci bags
Overall the food was ok
I could probably make the same stuff at home
Ah well
Cash Only brunch
While we were waiting, we were given complimentary mini pancakes which are some of the yummiest pancakes I have ever had
The eggs benedict on their famous biscuits is delicious as are their waffles and french toast
The food is most definitely worth the wait
first we each got a glass of reisling and a pancake with a dolop of cream cheese/sour cream mix topped with caviar and chives (not on the menu) I had the hallibut (one of the specials that day) it was placed on top of gaucamole, cream, and a lime vinagrette
on top of the hallibut was a good spoonful of a tomato mixture
RECOMMENDED
my husband got the fried chicken which came with coleslaw and spicy honey and awesome jalapeno cornbread
my father in law got the pork tenderloin
they gave him a steak knife but he didn't need it
the pork was so tender it practically melted in your mouth
for appetizers we got the fried green tomatoes
a definite yum!!
and after eating all of that
none of us had room for dessert
we went there before for brunch which was great as well
they're eggs benedicts are to die for!!
This place is an amazing joint! From amazing eggs to their deserts
We dropped in here by chance on a weekday and had the specials
Oh
my
god
Smoked Salmon eggs are awesome
Loved the cream cheese in the middle
My wife loved the salad
and guess what I did to
(not shamed to admit it) FRESH! so we decided to try it for brunch on a weekend
Yes the wait is long (they said 1 1/2 hours), but we were seated in 25 minutes
NOT BAD! This time we ordered different specials
LOVED IT again
Service is fast and with a smile
I tip 25% here
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK

CASH only so pack your pockets
ATM is nearby though)
As expected, we had a wait
However, we didn't expect it to be an hour and a half! So we made the best of it and were seated exactly at the 1 1/2 hour mark
We ordered the eggs bene and huevos rancheros
The food was served very quickly and was delicious!! We'd recommend both
If you are looking for very catering service, you may be disappointed
Although the server didn't check on us, we enjoyed everything
Overall was a great experience and one of our favorite brunch spots
Dinner, drinks, dessert
Fried chicken and fish tacos are the best
Good for dates with lovers or friends
Bring a large group
it's quiet from 6-8
absolutely delicious! especially there pancakes with the warm maple butter
and i don't even like pancakes! their omeletes/egg dishes are also wonderful
looking forward to expand my experience there beyond breakfast/brunch
I used to live on that block and would make a point to stop in as often as possible
even if it was to take out a biscuit
Those biscuits are unparallelled!
This is an update to an earlier review
We hadn't been here for almost a year (not their fault) and recently visited the other night
Their menu has expanded a bit, they have a very nice wine list, and everything we had (all four of us) was very tasty
Many thumbs up
clinton st
baking company was a great find on clinton and houston st
Small place, but has a full bar, delicious ice cream, and an outstanding weekend brunch
The wait is long if you don't get there just as brunch starts
They have some ice cream, I forgot the name of it, but it was rated the best Ice Cream in New York
And they're the only restaurant who has it
Delicious

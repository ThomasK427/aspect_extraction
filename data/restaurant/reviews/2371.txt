The Tiramisu was very good and that was the highlight of my meal
The regular menu is over-priced
The restaurant itself is a great dining experience, large and very active, often at times the room was so loud that I could not hear my girlfriend from across the table
The service is slow but very good
Overall I would recommend it but don't be in a rush and be prepared to spend some money for dinner
It's all media hype
The food is sub standard for a fine Italian NYC restaurant
The service perfunctory at best
4 pats of butter for 9 people and when more was requested 2 more were brought out! Never a question as to how the table was doing, what could be brought,made better etc
A glass of Napa Cab at the bar--  $ 17
50
Really
This is a place that exists on the printed word
The only patrons who would return to this restaurant are those who believe they must be SEEN here
I don't know why
New York has the finest, warmest, ,most exciting restaurants in the world
This is not one of them
We've enjoyed this restaurant a half dozen times, and the food is always great
A bit pricey for Italian, though
On our last visit, the cork from the wine bottle was compromised - completely soaked through - so we requested another bottle
Surprisingly, the manager came and argued over that, which we found insulting
The second bottle was fine, and the dinner was great as always
Service is impeccable (except for the manager!) and yet we will probably spend our high dining dollars elsewhere next time
Went for dinner and had the seafood risotto which was excellent, the pappardelle was great too
The service was good, the food is a bit pricey but overall it was good time
It did get loud, but overall it was good place to get dinner
It was a thursday afternoon and without a reservation, came my party of two
We were seated almost immediately
My waiter was very attentive and good with his personal reccomendations on the menu
I had the salmon entry with a salad
Surprisingly, the fish was very fresh and not like the 'typical dry salmon that sticks to your teeth and clogs your throat'
lol
(I'm on a healthy diet regime-so fish is pretty much all the meat I can have now)  My friend had steak here and he said it was delightful!   Dessert was wonderful
I had the creme brulee
It had enough of crust and the creme was very very good
:)
If you're looking for an upscale business lunch or dinner spot in Midtown, this is a good option, but expect to pay a premium
Service is generally very professional and efficient, if a bit frosty at times
The pasta and meat entrees are not too exciting, in my opinion, but are consistently good and the portions are generous
For an afternoon business meeting over coffee, or drinks after work, try the front bar area, especially in warmer weather when they have sidewalk seating
Went for lunch and got the price fixe meal
It was very good, but the options that were offered was too limited
Not a good variety
Seated promptly
Service was a bit slow, with a prentetious waiter
Overall I would recommend this restaurant, but I dont know if the food is quite as good as the other reveiwers would have you believe
However, the dessert was phenominal
INCREDIBLE Italian food, great prices, perfect location, and romantic atmosphere
what more could you ask for in the BEST Italian restaurant in New York City
I would take any one here!!
If you are in New York, you have to visit BiCE and try Pappardelle al Telefono excellent cuisine
Splendid place to eat and enjoy superb service
Bice has really good salads and pastas
I've been there a number of times and it is always good
It's a casual atmosphere
It's great any night or during the day -- there's outdoor seating
I have been there so many times that the overall is exellent good food good service nice ambient cute new italian manager at night(nik,niko
I don't remember)I will keep coming back guys great job
You have to try it to belive how good food is there
I travel a lot and trust me I have been in italy many times food at Bice is as good as a 5 stars restaurant in italy,service is good and ambient o my god unbeliveble
If you read anything negative just remember that every restaurant on this planet have a bad day every now and than, that's why I have disriguarded all the bad rewiews and I went there
Some people do not know good food when they see it or eat it
The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent
Normally when I dine out , I always look for good service and that is how I tip
I read the other reviews on citysearch but went anyway
Thank goodness I did
It was great
The menu was extensive, the service was great and they even came to the table with dessert and sang for my birthday
I do not know what restaurant the other people who rated went to but it was not this one
Definitely worth a try if youare willing to spend the money
We didn't have reservations, and so were seated at a table by the wait-station, but other than that, very pleasant, good food
Very loud, open space
Although we arrived promptly at our reserved time, we we told to wait while others with no reservations were promptly seated (very aggrevating!)  My wife had the veal which overcooked and tough (perfect if we needed our shoes repaired!)
I had the Filet which was fair, at best
The service was anything but attentive
We actually felt that we were a bother to the waiter who had more important things to do (still attempting to figure out what that was)
And to top it off, after we ordered our dessert and were told it was on the way, they finalized realized they were out of the item (how can a restaurant run out of strawberries and whipped cream?)
Ohhh, the coffee was horrible
So, we traveled all the way across the country to have a terrible Thanksgiving dinner at BICE!
I went to Bice this past Saturday with 9 people
The restaurant was packed
We asked the 2 gentleman working the door how long will it be
They fit us right in
Service was excellent and the food was amazing
The size of the portions were unbelievable
The place is fantastic
I would definitley go back
Ya got to get there homemade pasta!
I attended a business lunch here one afternoon and (i'm sure it helps that my boss is a regular) I felt like I was being treated like royalty - apparently being royalty is not uncommon there either since sir anthony hopkins sat directly behind me! The portions and prescence of each plate were well worth the price (it is a touch expensive) and i left completely full and satisfied with no room for dessert
In a word delicious
Bice, in my humble opinion, is the best restaurant in New York! Everything is delicious and the service is superb
Fit for a king and with subtlely flavored sauces every dish is a delight
Im in NY four times a year and I have to eat at Bices at least once during my visit
Its something I both look forward to and savor long afterward
One of my favorites is the beef carpaccio appetizer it is a meal in itself with the best beef, fabulous greens and dressing with freshly shaved Parmesan
All I can say is Bravissimo! Its 5 stars in every respect!
Enjoyed Giambelli's twice and have been floored each time
It is rather pricey-but it's New York we're talking about here
The second time we went there was a large crowd of parents and kids (who ran wild the whole time we were there) that limited the enjoyability of the meal somewhat
Food wise it was amazing

There are lots of places to sit
It seems that towards the end of the night they run out of stuff
We weren't able to get tea or flavored coffee
Large servings of drinks though
I visit Push Cafe many times (it's near my college) and it's a great place - alcohol is not expensive, nice food and a large variety of coffee drinks
Next time you're around
If you're looking for friendly service, good eats and good music Push is the place to go
This up-and-coming cafe/bar (the place offers a full bar!!) is a great date place and is fun to hang out in
You should definitely check it out, I'm positive you'll grow to like the workers, the vibe and their wonderful coffee
Push has a number of things going for it- good coffee, comfortable space, friendly employees, and they servce alcohol in addition to coffee, smoothies, and some muffins/pasteries
They do allow smoking, so for some people this is a plus and for some, a minus
The music can be loud at times and at other times, it's simply background music
This is always my first choice for a coffeehouse
The noodles are tasty, the service is fast, and it's very cheap
A great place to go to grab dinner and spend about twenty minutes
This place has an authentic feel, look and service of a Japanese Noodle shop
Location is decent and is worth the short walk from wherever you are
The noodles are good, the broth better and there is even a dish for vegetarians (miso chicken, sans chicken), whereas most noodle shops will only have pork or seafood based soup
Low maintenance, low-fi, low key attitude of RaiRaiKen makes it a great place, the best noodles in town makes it a great noodle shop
Best in the city
i lived in japan for a bit and can attest to the authenticity
great job rairaiken!
Very good, very fresh authentic ramen
The noodles are amazing, very eggy indeed! Can't beat the price
The space is pretty cozy and suggests a no-nonsense noodle shop
Only thing is, it's too far east! But then more people will discover this place and crowd it out
i love this place, it's cozy, friendly, and it has a true japanese feel, the kind of place you would see on a side street in japan
the soup is delish, the noodles a perfect al dente
perfect for a cold winter night! be aware of other imitation places
Unlike other places, their noodles are chewy (which I love) Their noodle bowls are very consistant no matter when or how often you go
My first impression of this place was, how interesting (not so exicted) and i see whole apples floating in a gigantic pot! -- apples give great auroma + flavors
I don't care what others say, i like this place for chewy noodlyes
Kimchi and dak-kwong(yellow radish) can be ordered for extra goodies
This is definitely the best and most authentic ramen shop in NYC
Their no frills menu doesn't offer much more besides the ramen but you don't need anything else
Order a ramen, the gyoza and a beer and you are set for a good, fast and economical meal
I just wish they had more seats!
RaiRaiKen consistantly delivers delicious ramen soups, that are created right before your eyes
These bowls of ramen look almost like pieces of art, the way they are put together
These guys definitely put their heart into everything from the taste to presentation of their meals
The best is the Chicken Miso ramen
I havent left the bar with any soup left in my bowl yet
A 10, so far; the best japanese food I had in NYC! I highly recommend with flying colors
Rai Rai Ken on 10th Street in the East Village is fantastic
It's the equivalent of Japanese fast food
Dumplings, Noodle soups, small entrees make up the food, while it has beer, and a cool Blade Runner-like feel to it, that make it a neighborhood favorite
Open till 3Am and Bar sittiung only, this Cheap-Eat is among the best of its kind in the world
One of my favorite hookah bars in the city, extremely affordable and great atmosphere
I went to Swiftys with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner, but nothing amazing
This restaurant is known for being very hot in its day and it was quite busy when we went
The crowd was older and the restaurant is very cramped, but it has old school charm
I had roast chicken and a salad
Both were very good, but nothing you couldn't get at similar restaurant
This place has a lot of character and it would be nice to have in your neighborhood
Went to dinner with some girlfriends on Wednesday at Calico Jacks and had a fun time
The space is pretty large and accomodates both Happy Hour and Dinner patrons
We only had appetizers which were pretty average
The guacamole could have been a little better but that is only my preference
Everyone there seems to enjoy the happy hour
For $7 you can drink unlimited until 7 pm and they have other fun specials
The crowd was mixed which is great and the DJ played great music
The sangria was awesome and the super large margarita looked great
I would recommend going for happy hour since it seems like the most popular time
I'm originally from Southern CA, so i would like to think I'm very familiar of how Mexican cuisine should taste like
After being increasingly disappointed by so many Mexican restaurants in NYC, I decided that great Mexican food the way I like it simply doesn't exist here on the East Coast
Went to a gathering here and I was skeptical, but kept an open mind
The margaritas were FANTASTIC, the staff SUPER friendly, and the guacamole AMAZING, and my entree was very tasty!! It's not pricey, just about right
The atmosphere is very cute, the crowd is laid-back, which is amazing for being in an uptight part of town
It's a fun place to kick back with friends
It's now my fave Mexican place in the city
Good food and drinks
Reasonably priced
Great happy hour
Nice staff that recognizes regulars
The Mexican authenticity of this place is one to be questioned heavily given the super-Americanized menu and lack of spanish-speaking staff
Sadly, the food lacks flavor but is thankfully super cheap if you come out for their happy hour
The drinks are reasonably priced and very potent
During the weekend nights, the crowd is full of 20 somethings (in which a few look much younger) and is almost Coyote Ugly style where ladies are dancing all over the bar
It makes for an interesting night, but not a recommended one
A good time for lunch or happy hour
Great drink prices during lunch and the margaritas definitely have a kick
After work draws a good crowd - mostly 20s 30s woth the occasional scummy local
Good to go with a group or alone
In sum
the freshest guacamole, the best margaritas (try the prickly pear margarita) great food, for lunch, happy hour or dinner, and a great fun, festive place to be! I love going in the winter, check your coat at the door, because you'll feel like you are miles away from cold NYC! The salsa is very good also
Most places it tastes watered down, but here it is great!
Great margaritas in a city where most are all sour mix
And the burritos are awesome too! I thought the only places to get good Mexican were the pricy restaurants, I was happily surprised
It's a great place to meet for an outta control happy hour, or a dinner that can evolve into a great night!
Great music! Old-school hip-hop like Biggy Smalls to current popular music
Food was fine
People were young
Overall, fun place!
Though the food is quite ordinal, this place becomes quite a good night out spot after hour
Rather than waiting to get in to the Vue, try Calico Jack for a little dancing experience! Its dance floor is limited, but DJ spins great music
west side sushi is a totally casual, neighborhood joint
the sushi is fresh and a decent value
the presentation is nothing spectacular and the flavors are not awe-inspiring, but the food is reasonably good
reliable and solid
This place has the best sushi in the city

I read about this place in the Post, but never stepped foot in it I ordered a red velvet cake to be delivered to lOwer Manhattan; It got there, and the broads at the office raved about it!
We went for the 1st time yesterday
What a joy this place is! The cake is too good to describe, the place was crowded but relaxing, and the staff is incredibly respectful and careful with orders
i'm in love with this place
the cakes (red hook red hot the chocolate malt one) are AMAZING
soft and supple and delish
the coffee also has that home made touch with a more unique taste than starbucks (don't get me wrong, love the bucks - but this is way better)
it's a bit of a treck, but worth the trip
if you live in the neighborhood, then i envy you!
This place is the literally the best bakery in the city
I dont know how it ended up in Red Hook, but it did
I love this place
The scones are literally to die for
Cool people great atmosphere
This is an amazing spot for the sweet tooth
Another great spot in Red Hook
The Scene Everything about Bombay Talkie reflects the splashy style and playful contrasts of Bollywood films
The interior drips with shiny surfaces and cool tones, and a posh Chelsea crowd fills black-leather booths while gazing upon a colorful Bollywood dance mural
The movies themselves play on HDTV above the bar, and next to the screen, glowing pink letters spell out the drink choices, with names like A New Phase of Life
The Food The menu may not be as adventurous as the decor, but it's just as thorough in execution
There's nothing impoverished about the "Beggar's Purse," a brittle pastry filled with warm chickpeas and potatoes and topped with a refreshing tamarind sauce
Rice is paired with specific entrees: Lamb meatballs bathed in a subtle mustard sauce get the traditional yellow rice, while the fluffy white variety accompanies the moist, tandoori-cooked mahi mahi, amorously kissed with ginger and garlic
I can't tell you how happy I was to find an Indian restaurant that does not claim to be fusion
It is authentic with many recipes you can tell are home recipes
The drinks were incomparable
The unrequited love made me want to cry with joy
The service impecable
You can tell these people have many years of experience
I was so impressed that they could manage a floor
I love this place
You have to try it
I've never left an Indian restaurant hungry before, until dining at Bombay Talkie
I thought the entree they brought me was the appetizer
The flavor was good, though not entirely authentic
But besides being paltry, the meal was difficult to enjoy in the noisy, crowded atmosphere -- not at all eastern in feeling
And the servers were so pretentious both serving us and afterwards
We left a decent cash tip on the table
Perhaps a table clearer picked it up, but the waiter chased us out the door, calling, What's the matter, sir, you didn't tip me? At that point, we wished we hadn't! If you're in the mood for good Indian food and experience, try a real Indian restaurant
Bombay Talkie is only for those who prefer hype over quality
I have been to Bombay Talkie since the beginning
It has grown into a a perfect balance or service, food and decor
I really am happy that people now know how wonderful this place is
I have to say, I just knew it
There are now many places that serve Indian snacks
I mean no one, no one, can beat Bombay Talkie's lamb kathi rolls
The spices, the sauce the kebabs are just perfect together
I make a long trip to have one when I can
Don't mistake me, the other items are fabulous as well
I simply want to say that I feel like I'm back home when I eat the food at Bombay Talkie
You can tell the recipes are unique and from family recipes
So, any time you are feeling homesick, just go to Bombay Talkie
Okay, you got it
I'm a regular
Bombay Talkie has made me fat
Bombay Talkie has fresh healthy food, wonderful desserts and great cocktails, and this has become an addiction
It's no one's fault but my own
I just can't stop going there on my way home
This truly is a must
Although when I went to eat dinner at Bombay Talkie on a crazy busy night, my waiter was extremely helpful through the menu, polite and polished
In fact, we just let him pick our meal
I was really impressed
You don't see this kind of service in NYC that much anymore
Bravo!
I study architecture and was really impressed by the juxtaposition of the colorful Indian canvases and the simple but elegant mode of the restaurant
This really sets this restaurant apart not only from other Indian restaurants, but a lot of other restaurants
I also can't say enough about the beautiful Japanese wood wall and the magnificant metal structure as you walk down the stairs
Just beautiful
By the way, great food as well
I never thought that in an Indian restaurant the music would be so varied and vibrant
Kudos to the sound designer
I heard Bosa Nova, Yerba Buena, Nusrat and others
When is the CD coming out?
Not only is the Indian food at Bombay Talkie unique, I love the dessert menu
You have a couple of traditional Indian sweets with a hint of something new and other fabulous desserts you would never expect in an Indian restaurant
Not the same old gulab jamun etc
The tapioca dessert was phenomonal
Go just for that
Wow, I can't tell you how sick I was of eating the same Indian food over and over again at each new Indian restaurant
I was pleasantly surprised at this menu
It had dishes I had never tasted before and exotic spices
I was told there was a touch of the South because the owner is from there, and many recipes are from her family
They must have great dinners
Please try this place, you won't be disappointed
I really love the idea that each season Bombay Talkie adds specials for that season, this time is summer
Marinated chicken Kebabs, and Tandoori Shrimp ,that melts in your mouth
their summer cocktails are refresing and absolutely delicious, for expample their India Carpirinha,  Max Magic Black Currant
this is a most try
Treat yourself
Who wouold have thought that India had it share of tapas that would make a fabulous meal
I tell everyone about this place
Regulars are treated like part of the family
Everyone already knows what I want
I don't have to order anymore
They know that a delicious selection of the unique street bites, Indian tapas
I have been to many restaurants with great wines
I have never been to an Indian restaurant that serves such an array from around the world
Moreover, they keep changing the wines to keep it fresh
I like to think of myself as a sommelier, and this place is just what I am looking for
Wow
Who is the mixologist in this place? Not only are the regular speciality cocktails superb, like the Ankur and Chandrasena, Bombay Talkie has gone to create Bombay Ices, special cocktials for the summer

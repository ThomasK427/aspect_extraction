Everything is extremely fresh and the service is good
We ate here one day for lunch, and then went back the next day with friends who aren't vegetarian, for dinner
They loved it! It's great for any discriminating palate, whether vege or not
The only con was the booth seating - it was too low for the tables making it uncomfortable to eat- choose a table instead
i finally found aq place delivering fresh organic carrot juice and good vegetarian food
I do eat meat, but am trying to cut down
this place is great! the beijing-style seitan tasted just like duck with no fat! i LOve THIS PLACE!
I've been to quite a few vegetarian restaurants, but this one, by far, has the most eclectic and extensive menu of any asian vegetarian places
And, unlike restaurants like Zen Palate, there's a wine list too!! Try the salt and pepper oyster mushroom appetizer
My only complaint is that the food tends to be on the slightly salty side
I've heard many good things about this place and was interesting in trying out their foods
There are a lot of selections to choose from, we had a rather large party, so it was great to sampled a bit of everything
There were absolutely no complaints from anyone, the food is delicious
For the non-vegetarians out there, some of the platters even tasted like meat
The hostess was pleasant and seated us promptly, the decor of the place is modern and the atmosphere is very welcoming
I'm a lover of meats, but this place is great! With a place like this, who needs to really eat meat anyways, I would recommend this place to everyone
If all vegan food were this tasty, we'd all swear off meat
We split two quick bites, one small dish, one large dish and a dessert, and we each had a beer
Total including tip: $66
No complaints here, especially since everything we had was delicious
EVERYTHING on the menu is great
I have eaten there three times and am in heaven
I can also say that since it is organic, you have no heaviness when you're done - you can walk 10 blocks to Felix for a few Mojito's afterwards
it may be a bit pricey for veg
food (14-18 bucks), but the 'large plates' are HUGE
if it wasn't so good, i would have had leftovers to bring home
the service was extremely attentive and friendly, the organic wine was delicious, the atmosphere was very warm and relaxing
i will definitely go back - there is an entire 'small plate' menu to explore!
The food at Gobo is so good you don't even realize it's vegetarian! The place has great atmosphere and friendly service
Dessert is also excellent
I recommend bringing your date for dinner
i am a meat eater
i like steak and more steak
this restaurant does not offer meat, instead they offer vegetarian dishes that taste like meat
most of the dishes have an asian flair and they are quite tasty
one particular non asian dish is a risotto with butternut squash
it was very delicious, i highly recommend it
the staff is young and very helpful
the restaurant has a nice young feel to it
nice date place
The motto is food for the five senses, but the experience excited my 6th
As a 20 something with high cholesterol, this healthy alternative to my usual 20 oz porterhouse turned me vegetarian with ease
My favorite dish thus far has been the butternut squash
I also liked the organic wine
Bravo!
Excellent idea and location for a vegetarian restaurant
The inside looks fabulous
However, after spending $65+ at GOBO I found myself hungry after one hour
The portions are quite small
As well, I haven't eaten animal products in over 6 years and the waiter was not sure which dishes had honey or casien in the food
Most disappointing!!! I was told that the honey is vegan because it doesn't come from bees but from locusts (thats right!?!), the locust flower the waiter soon corrected
Maybe he meant lotus
Steer clear of the honey and milk dishes vegans
Otherwise the food that I did eat was quite tasty, just not filling
the food was delicious! and the service was superb
definitely check the place out!
the food and service were both superb, and the atmosphere was nice and relaxed - the perfect long lunch spot
highly recommended
The food and service are unbelievable
In addition, you may run into celebrities
Ron Howard (Oscar winning director of the Beautiful Mind) was there the night I was there
The Scene The bar's upbeat Latin music, colorful stools and cocktail napkins, and a fruity drink menu are the first confirmations that Agozar lives up to its translation: "A good time
" Add gracious staff, 25 tasting-sized tapas and lively noise from the dining room and you'll be planning your second visit before you've been seated
Mingle at the angled bar or hit the narrow back room where the city's pretties are celebrating birthdays like it's their full-time job
The Food Cuban-raised siblings Diana and Gerardo Perez now offer their household favorites for sharing
(Servers suggest two per person for passing
) Groups will appreciate larger plates such as the harmonious Cuban sandwich with plantain chips, or mussels steamed in a banana leaf
But smaller dishes, including skewered marinated pork, breaded steak (Grandma's recipe) and four empanadas with four sauces, are where the chef shines, making each bite a small Cuban feast
Took my group of 8 to the restaurant for a birthday dinner and was seated promply and had a good time
The drinks are awesome and the tapas just the same
I would not recommend the dinner portions since they are mediocre
It gets busy on Friday nights but we really enjoyed the atmosphere, decoration and overall company
The service is slow and needs to be worked on
I would suggest going during happy hour for the best deal
The best mojitos ever and if you stop by during their happy hour you get 2-4-1
I haven't had a full dinner here yet but if it's anything like thier apps I'm sure everything will be great! Try it
it's worth the trip downtown
I had some friends visiting from out of town and needed to make a last-minute reservation for 6 people on a Saturday night
I was surprised to find that Agozar had a table available at 4pm that Saturday
after eating there, I'm not surprised why
Everything about the place was mediocre
Sangria was ok, food was ok, decor was ok
except maybe the service was less than OK
The waiter got my friend's order wrong, and when she flagged him down to tell him that it was not what she ordered, he looked at her like it was her fault that she didn't want to eat it
I asked for my skirt steak medium, and when it came charred and well done, I sent it back and asked for a less well done steak
Apparently, that was understood to be that I wanted it cooked even more because I got my SAME steak back, charred even more
They have 2 for 1 drink specials during happy hour and that is probably the ONLY time I will go back to agozar
The service was so bad, it overshadowed the great food and drinks
After being seated, we waited 15 minutes before flagging down a waitress to take our drink order, and it was not even busy! After taking our order, we never saw our waitress again, not even for the check
The table next to us caught fire (no, I'm not kidding), and a waiter and busser walked by without doing anything to help
We finally threw our glasses of water on the fire, which were not refilled for the remainder of our meal
Although I am craving the yummy El Coco mojitos, I will not go back due to the terrible service
If this restaurant wants to remain on the Best of lists, I highly suggest hiring a new waitstaff and a good manager
This place is a blast! I set up a birthday dinner for my friend here and couldn't have asked for a better time
Took advantage of the 2-4-1 Happy Hour special for a couple hours before dinner which cost us next to nothing
8 people, 6 tapas, 4 Parilladas (mixed grill for 2), 8 desserts and LOTS of booze came out to less than $50 a head
Service was phenomenal also
Live latin music, fun atomosphere and people made such a great vibe that we ended up staying and drinking almost until closing time
Def come here if you're with a group of people that are looking to eat, drink and be merry
I went to agozar last weekend with some friends for a low key birthday celebration

To top it all, the staff is consistently rude and brusque
The server seemed drunk, he forgot mixed up our food with some other table, ignored our requests for more water, drinks etc
I also noticed in my three visits, that they have been renovating their restaurant a lot, they have been making breaking, making breaking
I can see why, there are better choices on the block are probably giving them a run for thier money
Renovations cant cover up for food service
Overall, I would never recommend this place
So please dont be mislead
Chola desperately needs to train its waiters and improve its service - DESPERATELY! The South Indian food is very good, although North Indian is just average and oily
Their yogurt rice is so yummy, and I love the sambhar
However, the service is extremely poor
I went there one time, and the waiter was so rude I decided to leave
The next time (yes, I went again for the food), my husband and I ordered 2 dosas
Mine arrived and we had to wait for at least 15 mins before his did, and by then mine was very cold
I thought that was unacceptable
They even forgot to bring an accompanying dish
Their service was just totally unprofessional, and I will stick to take-out
I wish the chef leaves and this restaurant goes bankrupt - their service is that bad
On recommendation, we tried chola the other night
As we entered, we saw their front wall,with a white plastic pipe from where the water trickles, like how we have in the urinals, hostess told that its a water fall, we were shocked ! then the rings by the steps on the sides?we were totally lost! Further, waitin for 20 mins on the table, server came by, he could barely speak english,we just gave him the numbers from the menu
We waited for the appetizers for another 50 mins, finally the food came out, cold, oily looked like it was made with superheavy cream, ketchup boiled together with chunks of chicken half cooked in it, supposed to be their chicken tikka masala
The naans were so thick raw, just horrible
I regret taking my friend there
Never ever going back
What a waste of time money
We love Chola
I am very demanding about my food
We have never been disappointed
Never! We will highly recommend this place to everybody
Whenever we have taken our friends they always have been impressed by the service
There is some scope for improvement in service, but they are getting there
We went to dinner for my mom's b-day and received terrrible service
The seating was absolutely ridiculous, they tried to fit 5 adults on a tiny square table, when asked to move to a larger table we were not greeted with the the friendliest service
Appetizers were fairly decent, however had to wait almost an hour for our main course to arrive, when it did arrive it was cold! We spent over $250 on dinner and were truely dissapointed with the meal, we would not return
I am from Boston, and i visit my best friend in NY almost every month
And every time i come i insist to go to Chola
Its an indian food that is made from heaven! My favorites are: Chicken Tikka Masala, Samosa Saag paneer
And all the dessert menu are great
I also tried the south indian coffee
I order it usually after having the best alcoholic drink in the world which called Kamasutra! Yes
it lets your body feel like you are in a Kamasutra movie
I tried both dinner and buffet
They serve you many things in the buffet so you get full before you get up and see what they have! The people over there serve you like a royal family! I dont know why other people are so jelous of this restaurant and try to write bad reviews! Please be fair and stop taking sides!!
After seeing that this resaurant received a rating of 9
6, my family and I took my sister there for her birthday, however, the service was beyond terrible
A different waiter came to the table every five minutes so our food never came out in time, and we had to repeat things over and over since the original person who took our order was no longer waiting on us
We were rushed to get out even though we weren't even there for an hour, just so they could give the table away - meanwhile there were several unoccupied tables that could have been used
Most of the waitstaff lack basic manners and act as though a simple request is asking too much
I do not recommend eating here, there are plenty of better Indian restaurants with much better food and much better service
Spend your money elsewhere!
And a great value
Based on the menu prices, the value of the buffet is made up before you even hit the buffet with the appetizers that are served to the table
The buffet food is very good, although most of the more inventive menu items are usually not available
Nevertheless, it tastes great
Even if you don't go for the buffet, it is an excellent experience -- just a much pricier one
I ate here after searching Citysearch's reviews, and everyone else was right! I was visiting from Colorado, and ate dinner here with my 8 year old twins (who tried Indian food for the first time and loved it)
The food was phenomenal- perfectly seasoned, cooked to perfection
The wait staff was attentive without being overbearing, and our waiter gave thoughtful advice on dishes that would be suitable for the children
I wish Chola would open in my town! Will definitely return on my next visit
The best service, so attentive, great food drinks, a bit on a pricy side, but well worth it!
Excellent food and service
Have been many times and always had a wonderful experience
My husband and I loved this place
The food was absolutely delicious and the service was awesome
We had the Chicken Tiki Masala and a mango chicken dish and both were amazing
The staff was friendly and super-attentive
We are definitely going back
The food is worth raving about
Great ambience and EXCELLENT service (best we have seen in an Indian Restaurant)
We love it and we will definitely go back
A little on the pricey side with some dishes
We read about the Masala Dosa in the reviews and must say it lives up to the hype - simple and good tasting
Excellent food, excellent service, relaxing atmosphere, clean, and reasonable price
It's got all you can ask for
Super!
The service was better than any restaurant I have ever visited
The waiters and staff were very friendly and the food was incredible
The house special masala is a must must must try!! I recommend this too anyone - even if they normally wouldn't try Indian food
While E
58th St
is the mecca for Indian restaurants Chola seems to be the cream of the crop
The food is nothing less then wonderful and the pleasant and attentive staff makes the evening even more enjoyable
I just hope enough people frequent the retaurant for it to stay in business but not too many so it becomes difficult to get a table
A hidden treasure
We tried this restaurant on the recomendation of a friend
It is EXCELLANT! We thought Dawat was the best
we were mistaken, and have been converted!
We were visiting NYC with my parents and we decided to try this restaurant after reading great reviews on this web site and
we were not dissapointed
The ambience is warm ( it was a wet miserable day ), the waiters friendly, the service good
and the food excellent !!! We tried the buffet and it was very verygood
Their masala dosa's are to die for
Loved the food ( I am indian and should know ) Would definitely do back
In Short The menu strives to please all, offering an overwhelming number of dishes to choose from
The salad course include octopus salad and tuna tartare
Pastas like the tangy orecchiette with broccoli rabe and the smoky fusilli alla Amatriciana are popular choices
Main courses include hearty braised dishes, such as osso buco with risotto
We went to Bice for Restaurant Week and found the overall experience to be very good
However the food was good but nothing special
I had to send back my veal as it was raw in the middle
Even cooked through it was a bit bland and only a lot of fresh pepper made it tasty

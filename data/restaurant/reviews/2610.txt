we thought the food was pretty good we'll be regulars also
helps to hear the celebs like the place also
But, attention everyone - do not come for the celebrities, come for the food - freshest sushi around (special rolls, yellowtail, salmon, unagi, sweet shrimp with heads, orange clam amazing white tuna was succulent)
nigori sake plum wine are wonderful drinks
a very nice time but crowded before theater show
variety of menu is attractive
we came for pre-theater specials (bento boxes) were pleasantly satisfied - definitely a best buy for quantity includes green tea ice cream
super sushi deluxe was excellent
sake, milky sake plum wine quite good
only regret - raku is getting too popular with so many positive reviews quality reputation
use to be we could sit enjoy a relaxing meal have personal attention, now it's too busy espec
during pre-theater
we're too selfish as we sure miss the good ole days
but happy for raku wish them much success
1st off food is excellent, wife I shared the beef teriyaki box , sushi sashimi combo 2 special rolls (white red) - all delicious
a little sake/plum wine we are happy
BUT - we came during pre-theater rush which is a tough time
seems everyone ordered sushi there were tons of delivery orders (we can tell as we sat near the back)
svc is great but sushi chefs were overwhelmed (so many special rolls to make!)
we unfortunately were made late for the theater but we came at 7:00pm
you need to allot 90min
for relaxed eating better chance to get your specials in
still highly recommend but we'll be earlier next time! but we worry Raku will become tooo popular!
1st we were suspicious of all the high reviews being sceptics, but we 6 went we were pleasantly surprised! sushi is ultra fresh, y-tail, salmon white tuna 'glistens' richness
tuna was a deep red, not pale like some places
special spicy rolls amazing
upgrade to lobster miso soup
milky sake plum wine delicious
vegetarian selections for our pregnant friend was great
price is very fair for this area since you get quality it is well worth it
we can only say this is a real find beats out the more popular more expensive spots in the village midtown places
I hope tho this doesn't get toooo popular where you have to wait!! good for dates toooo!!
We were visiting from Jersey for a show and were made to feel at home
First impression of the decor I'd say was average, but the warmth of the host turned it around
He was more than willing to help us with directions and to share his knowledge of saki (as well as a free sample!)
He also asked if any of us were vegetarian which 3 of us were
The eel avacado was amazing as well as the spicy tuna- so fresh
Then we had a noodle dish like none I've had before, delicious
Overall, a great experience!
was great - we chose raku for it's relaxed unpretentious ambiance
they put 10 seats together us gals had a blast! the sushi was like 'buttah' they even took care of our vegetarian friend
their toro tartare, ankimo, spicy scallop, y-tail jalapeno, white dragon, veggie roll lobster miso were amazing! milky sake plum wine kept flowing! we're looking to hold our bridal a baby shower here 40+ people - at very reasonable pricing
ray, maki suweegee were great hosts
this place is some find!
My husband brought me here to celebrate our 10th anniversary but I was hesitant as I was turned off by raw fish
Being puerto rican, we cook our fish till it's dead! But my hubby loves sushi so to be nice I tried some
Will wonders never cease
With some good sake, I tried the salmon, yellowtail, king crab, eel (thought this would turn my stomach), red white tuna
All were fresh tasting - my favorite being the warm toasty sweet eel creamy white tuna
To think after all these years I am now a sushi 'lover' - well almost
If it moves I ain't eating it! I want to come back with all my friends!
my wife I travelled to the states toured from NYC to Niagara Falls to Wash
DC to Boston back to NYC
each day we spent in NYC (8days) we ate here as we found the food sushi excellent
the kama hamachi was absolutely the freshest sweetest
we will always have a friend there in ray ms
maki suweegee
My friend and I went there for the first time after reading the reviews
The suchi is the best I have had, and the service is excellent
I will recommend this place to anyone who love suchi
either way this place is great - for their fresh sushi you can't go wrong
my office always orders delivery while working late
this time my buddy I ate in - of course it's better fresh on the plate than delivery but if we work late this is where we order
so much to choose from so you really can't get bored
it helps they throw in something extra if you spend certain amount
the special rolls are quite extraordinary (white dragon lobster tempura!)
the owner gave us sample of nigori milky sake at lunch - we were buzzed! recommend over hakata no matter how many gift certificates they give us!
one of the better sushi spots in town, crowded pre-theater, better after 8pm
the sushi is very fresh
nice appetizer specials
lobster miso/lobster tempura rolls excellent
dinner boxes are best value - too much food includes ice cream! nigori sake is very very good
their white tuna, toro, y/tail also delish! uni is quite mild (unlike lots of other places where it is too strong tasting)
only complaint is too warm in back seating
sushi chef quite friendly, recommend sushi bar sit back
other reviews seem to be consistent except for 2 rating not to believe
ray is very friendly staff svc good (pre-theater/lunch hour can be slow tho)
menu quite extensive
there was group of 14 having a blast
will try again when not so packed
What a great place
Excellent service, terrific fresh fish (the spicy slamon roll melts in your mouth), frequent diners card - sweet deal; I'll be back
My wife and I were looking to catch a simple dinner before going to the theater and we fortunately stumbled across this restaurant
It turned out to be a great find for us because the fish was fresh and the service was excellent
I have to compliment Ray, who was our host, on making sure everything was to our liking
There are plenty of Japanse restaurants in NY but only a few that can give you great service and great food
I'm a restaurant manager, and I must say this is an outstanding establishment
Great Sushi, impeccable, friendly service, in a intimate and cozy setting, it is a must for all check out at least once
And definitely ask for the white tuna and white salmon selections
Hard to find sushi, with a unique taste
Perfect
As a vegetarian, I go to sushi restaurants only because my girlfriend loves sushi
Usually, I have to fill up on cucumber rolls
Not at Raku
I was surprised at their selection of non-fish items
I would definitely suggest the Vegetable Yaki Udon and the Vegetarian Sushi Sampler
This is one sushi joint I won't mind returning to
The food at Raku is very traditional and meticulously prepared for my palette
I really enjoyed the White Dragon Roll and Salmon Roll

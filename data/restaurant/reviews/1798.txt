I was so put off by the lack of service that I dodnt bother asking for them to warm it up
The restaurant was cute but the food was not worth the price
I would maybe try a much more reasonable lunch special here if they had one, but I am not rushing back
Note: they added a 17% gratuity to our party of only four- a bit weird?????
My friends and I love to go here when we're in the mood for some large portions
I usually order the fish escabeche which is a whole fish cooked with tomatoes, onions, peppers, and seasoning
Free corn soup is very good, the drinks are great, try the sorrel mojito
Not the best food you've ever had, but the only place in dowtown Manhattan (i think) where you can get good Jamaican with a nice atmosphere
7/29/5 Alya and I started out w/Calaloo rolls which were very good
The Codfish Fritters was extremely hot tough and it had the fine bones in it, skip it
The mango mojitio had NO liquor! I ordered the Jerk chicken entre w/ mac cheese
The chicken was burnt, I guess that was the jerked part of it because there was no pepper, not even black pepper in any part of the chicken
I had to order some bbq sauce to save it
The mac cheese was ok
Alya couldnt enjoy her Corn Avocado salad because the Codfish Fritters had burnt her gums
Negrils is very nicely decorated but cramped
The service wait staff were nice
Were going to the other one @ W
3rd to check out the lounge, and if the service/food is the same, then Im lowering the rating from what you see now
I was very disappointed with the service and food
I have visiting several times over the years and these two things remain subpar!!! I went to celebrate a birthday with my 17 month old daughter
the waiter rolled his eyes when he saw her at our table
Not a kid friendly place
He was M
I
A most of the night and we waited 1
5 hours for a seat! If is wasn't the birthday girls request, I would have never gone
The air conditioning could only be felt in the front seating area
WHO SAID ALL CARIBBEAN FOOD IS SPICY?!?!?!
I went there to celebrate my birthday and expected high quality food for the prices listed
Needless to say this wasnt the case
I am West Indian, and I've lived with the food all my life, and on some of the dishes I could have done much better in my own kitchen
The ambience is nice, but the food is watered down to the maximum with some ridiculous prices
If you want true West Indian food I suggest you venture out to Brooklyn, or even some places in the Bronx
Food is authentic and the price is fitting
The food here's really pretty good - all non-seafood plates are large and substantial, and there's plenty to go around the table for everyone to taste
It's a cramped space though, and the service is nothing to write home about, plus wait times are quite ridiculous (we waited 45min after being told 15min, even with a reservation)
The cuisine and cocktails are definitely redeeming, however
I just went this past Friday, 11/05/04 with my boyfriend
The waiters, bartender and the host were very friendly
Even though there was a short wait, we waited at the bar and tried some delicious drinks
The music is inviting and the food is delicious, my boyfriend and I don't know how we manage to eat so much I wanted to try every entree
I even order food to go
Must try the corn soup! they have the best sweet patatoes I have ever tasted
If I continue I'm going to run out of space
You must try it, you won't regret it!
Everyone should be blessed enough to try Negril's
The food was wonderful
Oxtails and plaintains are to die for
Watch out for the jerk pork chops, my companions claim they are REALLY hot
The starters are great
Although you may not need them since they serve soup with evey dish
Must try the rum punch!
Wonderful oxtail, the chicken wings are divine as are the mini beef patties, the jerk salmon, and the coconut pumpkin soup
the chef sometimes creates modern twists on traditional dishes like foofoo (turned cornmeal) - which are always off the hook
waiters are always hotties as well
the only jamaican restaurant in manhattan that i will go to
The food is off da hook!!! You must try the baked salmon with jerk sauce! The drinks are great too! The only tiff I have is that on a any night getting a table is always a 30 - 45 min wait
Annoying but once you get to their fabulous food all of that is just a memory
I needed a place to eat dinner and happened upon the restaurant in the area where i work
it is completely unassuming on the outside, you would never know how good the food it or how refreshing just by looking at it
but from the first course we were hooked! highly recommended!
Excellent place to have dinner on a friday night
staff is friendly and the food is always good in both presentation and taste
This is a place where you get your money's worth and leave feeling like you just ate an authentic meal
This Restaurant offers great drinks but be very careful of how many you have
The food is great the and the atmosphere is really comfortable and relaxing
Good place to go on a Friday nite
I must return
Making reservations is a waste of time
We had a reservation for 9pm and didn't sit until 10pm! Food was overpriced
Shrimp Negril for $17 included 5 shrimp which were not even hot
On a positive, drink options were plentiful and very good!
What a great authentic meal we had
Have been to Jamaica many times, so I have had the real thing
Fried plantains were the best, curried goat was succulent spiced perfectly, bean soup fabulous
The waiter was so attentive, polite
Service was a 10
Decor was cheery the bathrooms were charming
A clean lovely, albeit small, place to eat dinner
Been here a dozen times
Food is always yummy, crowd is always cool, service is excellent
Can get very crowded at times
The drinks could use a kick though
But
the overall flavor makes up for it
Negril offers good inexpesnive Caribbean food
It has a good ambience
We had jerked chicken and jerked king fish, they were really spicy
i don't think there was any warnings in the menu
THe service is slow
This is a wonderful restaurant, the food is excellent and the atmosphere is truly relaxing
There is great service and bright personalities
If you're looking for a nice quiet dinner, this is probably not the place, but if you're looking for tasty food, great drinks and just a plane ole good time, then this is defnintely the place
It is a bit small so be sure to make reservations, especially for Friday and Saturday nights
Went there with some friends
The meal was very good and the service was friendly
Although we stopped next door to a place called Fuelray Cafe/Lounge for dessert and drinks afterwards
I would say
Negril for dinner

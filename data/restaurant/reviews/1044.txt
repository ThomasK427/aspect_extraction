When I lost my credit card and asked about it on the phone (cuz last place I used the card was this restaurant), she didn't even care and didn't even look for it and hang up on me
I made a reservation, but that was also ignored and we had to wait for 45 mins
The food was over-priced for the quality, the place is very small and noisy
I would never go back
You will find much better places around here, don't go
I went with 2 friends and was very pleasantly impressed
The waitstaff was very courteous and knowledgeable about the interesting menu, and the food was phenomenal
(must try the fois gras appetizer and chocolate milkshake for dessert
Amazing
) The manager, who was really nice, even came over to see how everything was
The lounge upstairs was a perfect place to have an after dinner drink
An overall wonderful dining experience (don't get that much around midtown,) I'm definitely coming back and telling friends to come
Where do I begin
First we had 8:00pm reservations and they did not seat us until close to 9pm
We were told that the chef made a rule that either the whole table ordered from the restaurant week menu or the regular menu
It was all or none
My fish was very undercooked
The side dishes were sent to us 15 minutes after our meal and it took 30 minutes to get coffee after our dessert was served
The wait staff were rude and unaccomadating
A real disappointment
I happened to hear about this restaurant through friends and ended up having one of the best meals that I ever had
First and foremost, everyone, from the hostess to the bartender were incredibly receptive and genuine and made us feel as though we were dining in our home
Secondly, I can't even describe how good the food was
The drinks are a bit pricey, but the flavorful cuisine makes up for it in the end
Dessert is heaven on earth
I definitely suggest trying the Strawberry Tart and the Leche Flan-----the creative use of such simple elements resulted in pastry perfection!!!! Hurry up and eat here before the crowds start filing in
We thought we'd try out Oceo during restaurant week, but it's wasn't such a good deal
The decor was hip and the presentation was excellent, but the food was lacking
The waitstaff told us that they had already run out of one of the entrees (before 8 p
m
), and the restaurant wasn't even that busy
Then they did a bait-and-switch by using cheaper ingredients in one of the dishes
The head waiter made some lame excuse about how the chef had asked the hostess to revise the menu but it had not been changed
Overall, we were disappointed
Oceo is a hidden gem we had the pleasure of discovering
The food is amazing, the service is a little slow but in the end the whole experience was worth it
Great place in the theatre district
The food is outstanding and very creative
It's fun to see motivated cool people in the restaurant industry
I would recommend it to everyone
The Scene In a glowing candlelit space the size of a studio apartment, diners on dates and small groups sit snugly on wooden banquettes
Distressed walls and a coved roof give the dining room a lived-in feel; despite the draft from the front door, it's pleasant and cozy
Service is eager to please but can be sparse during a rush
The Food The menu runs from rustic Italian to loosely interpreted French classics
Start with an order of the croquettes--salt cod, ham and cheese rolled into balls and deep fried until melty and golden brown, or one of the pizzas, cooked in the wood fireplace and sparingly topped with cheeses, the thin crusts nicely charred
Among entrees, the sea bass, bright with lemon and fennel, is the best choice
The cassoulet is heavier on the meat than most, boasting a leg of duck confit, sausage, pork and more
Choose the warm pear beignets for dessert
I came here with my husband's family, and had a terrific experience
The menu was small, but the food delicious
The night we went, they were out of a couple of the items on the menu, which is acceptable considering how fresh the ingredients are
I shared some wonderful appetizers and had a great matzo ball soup
The garden with glass skylight is lovely
Reservations can only be made for parties of six or more, so plan on waiting a bit if you have fewer people
Like other reviewers, I had been wanting to try this place for quite some time
I went in on a Thurs
night as a party of 6, which meant a tip of 20% would be included in the bill
I eat out OFTEN and the servie here was the worst I have experienced in years
When we were able to find our waiter, he was surly and obnoxious
He clearly did not inform the busboys who ordered what because no one could figure out where the appetizers or entrees were supposed to go
I was accompanied by foodies, yet the waiter treated the few questions people had about the menu as if he was dealing with diners who had never eaten at a decent restaurant
I would never go back
Food was below average
You look inside and it looks so great
An hour later, you're being forced out by the rude staff after a bland meal
The dishes sound fancy, but taste dull
For example, the cooked grapes were among several boring flavors sampled
The service was less polite than the low NYC standard
Save your money and your patience and go elsewhere
this place is great! romantic, but not stuffy or cheesy
the food is not ridiculously expensive although the wine can quickly add up
the front dining room has a ceiling covered in cork
you then pass through the small kitchen brickoven and arrive at the solarium/greenhouse dining area in the back
On a sunny winter day, brunch in the backroom is an amazing experience
I wanted to order everything on the menu and never wanted to leave
The food is the chef's interpretation of old world european food, i think
There is nothing like a real wood-burning brickoven to cook your food
They do not take reservation, but a 10 - 30 minute wait is totally worth it
The ambience in this restaurant is tops in the city, for a cool, quaint off the beaten path SoHo restaurant
We sat in the back, which was a bit cold, this past weekend (12/3)
The service was exceptional, wine list very Euro very good
The food was aggressive in it's attempt at melding flavors, which I enjoy
I had grilled quail, sausage grapes
sounds totally odd, but was very very good
My wife enjoyed the chicken
Portions were a bit small
Price was surprisingly a bit low, which is good
But this place is all about the atmosphere
which is great for a date
I love August!! this restaurant has a great menu with the ambience to match
the onion tarte is delish, as well as the grilled fish, beef, wahoo!! pretty much everything on the menu is worth trying
It's one of those west villagey places you pass on a Saturday afternoon and say we've got to try that - it looks so inviting, and then you finally get around to it and encounter disappointment
The atmosphere is wonderful - warm, nice smells, good music - overall great ratings in this department
However, everything we ate was salted to an extreme, and the steak, so regrettably, was saturated with butter
Also, the french fries were $11 and nothing special
The warm burrata appetizer was also soaked in too much oil
The bean soup and the wine were the best parts of the meal
Went for lunch on Saturday
Lunch selection was simple, yet interesting
Portuguese Chorizo Soup, although i didn't have it, looked quite good

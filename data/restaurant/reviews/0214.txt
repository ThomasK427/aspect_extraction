Try it, you won't be sorry
After about 30 minutes of pacing back n' forth on Mulberry Street
we gave in to the owner who politely reeled us in
My friends and I shared the fried calamari and stuffed mushrooms
We also ordered the salmon penne (lots of salmon!), lasagna (lotsa meat!), pancetta pasta (too much white sauce!), sausage bell pepper pasta (greasy), chicken parmagiana (very thin and burned) and I had the ravioli (great)
Overall, we had a good dining experience b/c the service was great
It was funny that they played the Godfather-Whacking theme song
But again, I'm sure you can find the same quality food next door
Tellos is one of those little restaurants that you just happen to run into by accident
Im glad we did
Once inside it was like one big happy family
Everbody gets to know you
In ten minutes we already felt like we were regulars
The table next to us recommended that share because the portions are big(we split two entrees)The food was so good I wish that there was some left over to take home for the next day
When we were ready to leave the waiter came with a big jar of biscotti and said you can t leave until you have one
We each had two! Tello is a real good find
The food is so amazing
Huge portions, great and attentive service, and pretty good prices
Great for a date, or for a nice dinner with friends
I came into the restaurant on a busy Saturday night and was hit first by 20 minutes wait and the small wine bar was full
Not a great start but I had heard great things about Tello`s
The Brazilian bartender who greeted us was exceptionally kind and attentive and we had the most delicious cosmo I`ve ever tried
The food was great the shrimp fradivolo was fab and the gnocchi was delicious they were decent in size (not huge which is fine by me)
The price doesnt necessarily reflect the rustic ambience but the food most certainly is worth it
What more could you ask for?!? Thanks Pedro, see you next time!
Been going to Tello's for years and tonight was the last night I will go back
We made reservations but ended up in the worst table
It was next to a garbage bin by the bar
We were in the middle of the busy aisle and got bumped by wait staff several times; had to stop eating everytime they pass so we won't choke
The garbage bin was awful
I pointed this out to the hostess who said that it was a busy night
I informed her it was not fair as we made reservations but given the worst table while walk-ins got better She just shrugged and walked away
It ruined a wonderful evening planned and embarassed as I recommended this place
The food is good but dinner at a hefty price is meant to be enjoyable
True, customers come and go but a loyal customer leaving is disappointing
I celebrated a friend's birthday here last night and had a great time
Greg, our server, was so helpful, especially since we had a large party
Food was fantastic, inexpensive and portions are huge
Great for parties, but romantic, too
What a gem this place is!
We're kicking ourselves for not going here sooner
This is what I think of when I think of a New York Italian restaurtant
Lovely warm ambiance, great food
Both times I've had the Chicken Tello which is chicken in a sauce with olives, sausage and mushrooms
Yum
Portions are big, prices aren't
Loved the watercress salad with bleu cheese and toasted walnuts
Carpaccio and mozarella salad as well
Wine list doesn't have any years on it, which bugs wine lovers, and we struck out with thewaiter-recommended bottle we ordered
But the carafe of house wine I had the on next visit was actually better and cheaper
The Scene Go after work and you'll wonder if it's open, but go after dark and you'll wonder if it ever closes
Sala (Spanish for "living room") is designed to look like an Old-World alleyway, with iron lanterns, a rustic brick archway and an open kitchen with tiled roof
Pretty patrons complete the alfresco fantasy, exotic and alluring enough to make it feel more like a movie set than a tapas bar
The Food The Spanish cuisine is far better than it needs to be in a place where most believe it's sexier to snack or sip, than to tear into a Segovian-style leg of lamb
The pinchos platter gives a taste of all six delightful apps, including flaky battered cod and balsamic-dressed sliced duck
Some look to seafood paella or peppercorn-glazed rib eye for the main course; others cut to the chase and look to the downstairs lounge
I always enjoy going to Sala
It's not too crowded, has great decor, waiters and bartenders are laidback and friendly
Great sangria too
The menu has a wide variety of unique small dishes (which are delicious!)
I highly recommend checking out Sala during 1/2-price tapas times
The value was incredible, the atmosphere was quiet and laid back and the service was great
I ordered the chorizo and if you would love to eat a big plate of sausage for $5, you won't be disappointed
Everything was delcious and the place was quite empty - we had the lounge to ourselves
I took my girlfriend to Sala for her Bday, and we had a great time
I heard it gets crowded, so I made reservations and had no problems with seating
Our waitress was great, she made us feel very welcome, made recommendations, made sure not to rush us and let us enjoy the dinner
The food was very goodwe tried a bunch of small plates and 2 entrees, and lots of sangria
Everything was very well made and we left full and happy
It's a bit pricey, but worth it
If youre like us and like to try a little bit of everything and like to get drinks too, you'll get away with about $75p/pthe place looks very cool too
If youre a group of people call ahead for prompter seating
If its two of you call ahead and ask for a further away corner, the place gets noisy
The service is just ok but the food will make you keep coming back
Its a bit pricey for the portions but, once you've taste it you'll forget about the price
Try the grilled squid
or the garlic shrimp! It is bangin!
I had my boyfriend's surprise 40th birthday at Sala and couldn't have asked for a more perfect place
The service was outstanding, the food was great, the Sangria was tasty, and the atmosphere was perfect in the downstairs lounge
We had a private bar and sound system
Can't wait to go back for dinner !! I highly recommend Sala for private parties!!!!!!!!
This place is a great find in the Bowery area -- lively with great service and the most interesting decor
Our waiter was very nice, friendly, and helpful
He wasn't as attentive as he should've been, but thankfully we were too busy enjoying the funky modern Spanish music coupled with the scrumptious food we were diving into
The chorizo platter and the dates were excellent
I was impressed at the variety this place had and was a bit taken back by their extremely contemporary ambiance
Price wise, this place is average, until they feature their half off appetizers deal, which only then is the food worth ordering in abundance
I organized a birthday dinner here
The staff was very helpful and accomodating to my group
The tapas, entrees, and desserts were very tasty
The servings were actually bigger than we expected
Sala definitely made my birthday dinner and enjoyable and memorable experience
Went here a few weeks ago and it was fantastic
Had a homey kind of feel to it
Its kind of loud and the tables are on top of each other but its still a good date spot
The fried goat cheese appetizer with honey is a must and might be the best goat cheese I have ever had
The duck was fantastic also and I was a big fan of the mashed potatoes
The only problem was my girlfriend didnt want her french fries that came with her steak so she kept helping herself to my potatoes
If you get the steak bag the fries and tell them you want the mashed potatoes
Cool atmosphere but such a let down

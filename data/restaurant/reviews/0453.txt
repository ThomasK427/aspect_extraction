the food is also pretty authentic, and you'll find rare dishes that you don't typically find @ thai restaurants in the city
service is also very courteous and accomodating
Avoid this place
We went there, no one greeted us
So we sat at the bar, the bartender didn't seem like he wanted to be there
We didn't know if we should order a drink or leave? Actually, everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed
We were wondering why they were there to make our dining experience miserable? I guess they were miserable
Not our problem
Anyway, the owner was fake
The way she spoke to her employees was unbelievable
They must like entertaining her thoughts because they can't think for themselves
That was our dining experience at dragonfly
Food was average and to make it worse the service is terrible
There are much better places elsewhere in NY
and worst of all the have the audacity to tack on a 17% gratuity!! All I have to say is
go somewhere else
i frequently go to dragonfly for the FOOD
the noodle dishes are excellent
if you are quick to be disappointed by bad service, i would avoid this place as the service is terrible (except for the bartenders), but if you overlook it for the food and great atmosphere, it's so worth it
Dragonfly has some interesting decor
The food is a little bit bland
The wait staff is typically not too helpful
They served the main course before the appetizers eventhough we asked for the latter first, to which our waiter responded that they don't serve them separately without telling us beforehand while ordering
Management makes the place sound more fabulous than it really is - telling a friend who threw a party there that there are 2 floors - the downstairs is literally merely 2 steps down
A tad bit overpriced considering one can get tastier and cheaper Asian food elsewhere
Asian food that needed more spices is a bad thing
I had the kare kare hot pot and it was bland and needed salt, but there was none on the table
Even the spring rolls and scallion pancakes were bland
My girl and I visit Dragonfly about every other weekend and it's always been a great place to chill out
The martinis are very affordable
Try their Jet Lee it's off the hook or their Flip Passion but I would not recommend any of their dessert drinks
Their food is good and also very affordable
Although seating is limited and they close rather early it' the perfect place to take a date and chat
The dee-jay on the weekends creates a wonderful blend of old and new school rap sounds
The food is great and incredibly cheap
I had an appetizer main course and it was about $10
They've got a fantastic array of vegetarian items so there was a lot for everyone to choose from
The food was served quickly, although in several installments
It was hard to get the waitstaff's attention at times and the food didn't really arrive at a normal interval
The drink menu is extensive, but a lot of them were really sweet and hovered around $8-9 (unlisted prices on the menu)
I like to eat and play here
Good Filipino food and excellent weekend hip hop parties
i was at dragonfly with a few friends last week and it was an absolute blast!!! i haven't been in a restaurant where they made us feel like royalty
talk about bartenders that are on the ball- always ready with a light for your cigarette - ready to make your drink of choice
the food was amazing and catered to all our different palates
jade and her staff rocked!!! this is a place worth coming back to
Some of the best bar service anywhere in the village
Cute and funny bartenders are always ready to take your drink and food order
They're even ready with a light for your cigarette
On the weekends when the dj spins, you never know what might happen
Beautiful people, great service, HUGE Fishtank, and excellent food
I am taking my friends here next week!!
A very relaxed, casual cool vibe
The food is amazing
When DJ's spin on the weekends, you'll find beautiful people everywhere
I live in Queens, but I make the hour and some ride just to hang out
Great and extremely attractive staff as well
Service was not very good
I understand how the waitress gave us time to review the menu, but we were obviously done and had all our menus closed at this point
It took at least 10 minutes for her to finally wander over and ask to take our order
Sizzling beef? It didn't sizzle when it came out
Perhaps that dish could've been prepared last to wow us
Food was disappointingly unsatisfying especially the Panicit Palabok which was tasteless
The only dishes I enjoyed was the sizzling beef and the pannang beef but even then the sauce was a peanut sauce and not a curry served with string beans
Your money's more worthwhile at Lemongrass Grill not too far away from there
Lots of variety to choose from the menu, but nice try Dragonfly
Food: I had Crisy Pata and my GF had Curi Curi
The food was rated 8
5 and 9 by us
I am Latino and my gf is Filipina
Ambience:Very nice
Love the couches for when a group of people come by which you reserve in advance  Service: Pretty Good
Waiter/Waitress where very receptive to our needs and servicing us
Value:  Total Cost: 65 including tip 2 meals, 2 cokes, 2 drinks, appetizer, 2 deserts
Overall: I gave it 8
5 and my GF gave it a 9
Excluding the Desert(Tiramasu) which we both did not like
Dragonfly is totally like coming home! I love the food here (definitely have the Kare Kare or the Sinigang na Sugpo-- my favorites!)
My cousin had a party here the other week, and the staff and Jade (the owner) were totally accommodating to her needs
excellent asian american comfort food, cute drinks, lovely staff, great atmosphere
dragonfly makes me happy!
In Short After a few changes of the guard, Compass has installed executive chef John Fraser, providing innovative American cuisine to the uptown epicurean crowd
Though you'd never guess from the ordinary facade, a sizeable space awaits with multiple private nooks
The handsome interior combines glass and natural elements creating a contemporary museum atmosphere
The menu, equally artistic, includes confit of pork belly, crispy skate, olive oil-poached lobster and a salty sweet hazelnut and potato-chip gateau
After hearing many friends rave about Compass we gave it a try
Not only did it hold up to the high standards I was expecting but it exceded them
We went during the Summer 2006 Restaurant Week
The food is spectacular
The Rock Shrimp Gazpacho apetizer was great, the Duck entree was the best duck I have ever eaten and the chocolate mousse desert was really rich and delicous
Others had the trout and thought that it was fantastic as well
Service was very good and wine selection was amazing
There are few restaurants in NYC I would recommend more
You enter off the street through majestic doors, frosted on the bottom and a dramatic runway like hallway illuminated with candles and spot lights which show you the history of New York around Central Park
You are welcomed by friendly managers and hosts at the front door with a smile and warm sense of sincerity in their voice
You can eat at the bar, in the lounge, the main dining room or in one of the private dining rooms depending on the size of your group and your personal preference
The service, food and beverage service is 100%
John Frazer works with local produce such as Satur Farms on Long Island and highlights what is in seaons which allows for flexibility within the menu as items come and and out
There are staples and signature dishes Mr
Frazer keeps on for repeat customers and sometimes you will receive an extra mid-course as a thank you for your continued patronage

Never again in this life time
I have never in my life complained to a manager at a restaurant or asked for anything to be comped
Son Cubano gave me a reason to do this for the first time
We made late night reservations (11:00) in order to enjoy the atmosphere and dance for my friend's birthday
We were seated right in the middle of the dance floor and then informed that the kitchen was closing in 1/2 an hour!! In other words hurry up and eat! Soon the patrons were practically on top of our table-wanting to dance and one even gestured to us that we should hurry
I asked the waiter to move us to another table because we didn't want to rush our meal
He quickly grabbed our things leaving some things behind
He continued to rush us reminding us 3 times that we had to close out our check
How Rude!
Food was good, not great
The ambience was fun (music, drinks, etc
)
The waiters and bartenders were great
What I thought was a rip off was, when we were ordering, the waiter told us there was a minimum of food we can purchase
It was either 2 appetizers or 1 meal per person, nothing less
I was shocked
1) When we made reservations, no one told us that, 2) Isn't this America? If I only want to eat 1 appetizer because I am on a diet, why am I forced to order more? If I didn't have too much money and still wanted to go out to dinner with my friends, why am I forced to spend more money? There are plenty of great restaurants in NYC and they don't force you to order a minimum of food
For that fact, I will never go there again!
Lasr Friday night , 3 of my girlfriends and I went out to Son Cubano
We had reservations for 10:30pm
We ended up waiting for a table for almost 2 hrs
Every half an hour we would come up to the hostes who would apologise and ask us to wait 10 more min
Finally, at about 12 am, we came up to a diff
hosetess, who told us they have nothing more availible
When we explained that we were waiting for almost 2 hrs and were told by a diff
hostess to wait 10 more min, we were told that that woman has alredy left home
How is that for good management ? Apparently , there is no communication between the staff , not to mention poor organization skills
In addition , food was tasteless and not fresh !
For the past several months, it has been IMPOSSIBLE to get into this restaurant! My friends and I love to go after midnight for the great DJ and all night dancing
But, now they are SUPER strict at the door
(I spoke to one of the bouncers last week and he even said it was a bit excessive, but only b/c one guy is a total ASS and won't let you in unless you're on a guest list
But, there is no guest list
All you have to do is make a dinner reservation between 11 and midnight
and once you're in, you're in! (or you can reserve a table with a group of people) Just go have a few appetizers and drinks, then head on over to the bar
the music is great and I always stay til the wee hours of the morning and so will you!
THe place has new promoters that dont let anyone in that no one seems to know how you get on this idiotic guest list
I went twice this year, 1st in the summer and i was told that the only way to get in was if i was on a guest list then, the 2nd time I tried really hard to find out how to get on this stupit list and no one at the restaurant knew, all they said was that we had to talk to the promoters

Well, i guess the owner of these place doesn't want to make money they keep turning everybody away unless they get on this misterious guest list
I guess the only way to get in is by tiping the bouncer, im pretty sure thats what they want
Waiting in line for 45 minutes in a winter New York night is not fun! The door man told us that the only way we could get in is if we would buy a bottle, priced at $200
After insulting one of my friends by saying that he could not get in because he was wearing sneakers, he let him in after buying the bottle
At last we go in, only to see that the place is half empty
You got to be kidding!!! Oh ,and on top of that the waitress was rude and the music horrible! SO if you want to spensd $200 to get into an empty place, be my guest!!!!!
The only reason why I hit Son Cubano is for the music and the mojitos martinis
The live Cuban music is a great during dinner treat, while after 10 PM the DJ spins great Latin music, and Hip Hop
Make sure you get here early, and have a couple of drinks or dinner to avoid standing in line
Aside from the 3 hour wait at the extremely uncomfortably cramped bar with pushy people - we had reserved a table for 10 and were seated separately at 3 DIFFERENT TABLES! As soon as we were seated we were told to order within 5 minutes OR ELSE we would be kicked out of the table! The service was horrifyingly bad --- I get better service from the local pizza joint! The food was NOT authentic cuban food (it was out of a can fake stuff)! The crowd - well, if you like the pretentious wannabes that steal coats and purses from the patrons - you'll find them here! If you want good cuban food and great dancing - this is New York City! There are 4 zillion places that are a billion times better than this poor excuse of a trendy wannabe place! DON'T GO THERE!
The majority of the crowd is people who just want to go out in the meatpacking district and be seen
But the problem is that the people are either old or tourists
Do not waste your time, the food is terrible and the staff is rude
Even when you are spending ridiculous amounts of money the staff is completely unattentive
Go to the many other places in meatpacking that are worth it
I loved this place
We had to wait a bit at the door but once we were inside the drinks were plentiful and the music was incredible
I danced all night long while drinking mojitos
It was absolutely fabulous
It's hard to find a restaurant that you can have fun at
Son Cubano is great for all occasions
I've been there for birthdays, a bachelorette party, and dates and always manage to be happy
The service is great and I recommend getting a pitcher of sangria
Besides the food, the live music and atmosphere make Son Cubano a must
This was the second time I tried to go to this place because I love latin dance music
So when the guy at the door said the only way me and my 5 girlfriends could get in was to order bottle service we went for it to try it out
Once inside we realized right away it was not worth it
The crowd was very unattractive or in their 50's, the service from the waitress was awful, the bathroom was broken, and to top it all off they LOST MY CREDIT CARD
Turns out they just gave it to someone else
Overall this place was a complete headache
There are better places in nyc that play good latin dance music
All of these people who are complaining about the service need to understand that this is a business and it's taking advantage of being the place to be right now
If you are truly just looking for some good cuban food, go for lunch and you will not be disappointed! Everything on the menu is delicious and the service is great
Take an extra stomach with you - you'll need it!!
One of the most un-accommodating hostess' I've ever experienced
After arriving an hour early for our reservation for 2 and politely asking for a table near the band we were promptly seated at one of the worst tables in the place
We couldnt even see the band, let alone hear them
Dont let the phony smiles fool you
The hostess is certainly not on your side
The food was horrible as well
Ropa Vieja was extremely dry and tasteless as was the Pork Loin
The best part of the night was our waiter
Very accommodating and we were not rushed at all
Maybe because we had the worst table in the place, lol
We will never return
The atmosphere is lively but feels slightly empty, which the bouncers told me was due to the owners not being into quantity
It does allow more room for people to dance, but who wants to see hot girls turned away at the door b/c it's full? As others mentioned, horrible service, along with a 28% mandatory service charge when they wouldn't even refill our ice bucket or mixers
If it weren't for the music the place would be a complete disaster
We had a reservation for 7 pm, and when we got there, they said thge table had to be available by 9 pm
We should have left but we were celebrating my friends' 10th year anniversary
The waiter and the manager were the most rude, unhelpful and awful people
The food was below average, pricey and it all came at different times
If it weren't for the music, that place would be long gone!
from the hostess to the bartender to the waiter (who told us that we had to leave because the tables needed to be turned around more quickly even though it was a friends engagement dinner)
I love cuban restaurants, and this used to be one of my top choices in the city, but I will never return again
I suggest you (the readers) stay away as well
If it sucked the 1st time it will sucked the 2nd time unless you show up with Marc Anthony or any other celebrity by your side
The 1st time I went with a friend for casual dinner and it was very disappointing, the food is far from authentic Cuban food and the service makes you want to get your meal to go
The 2nd time I warned my friends not to go there but they still didn't listen and we were treated worst than a street dog
The manager at the front door acted as if he was guarding the white house and had us waiting on line for a long time, we got tired of waiting and left
he didn't even care that there was more than 10 of us, apparently they don't need the business from the local middle class New Yorkers
My 3rd LAST visit

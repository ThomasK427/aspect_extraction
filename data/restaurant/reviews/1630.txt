Good selection but disappointed soft shell crabs not available
Fish/Shrimp chips was oily soggy overwhelmed by their french fries
King crab, oysters, mixed greens, clam chowda, calamare virgin banana/strawberry daiquories were good
key lime pie not bad
overall they did good job, just not the best food in town
Jason our server was very good though
City Crab is one of my favorite restaurants in New York
The food is consistently appealing and the atmosphere is relaxed and fun
The manager, Sue, is radiant and her warm personality resonates throughout the restaurant
The rawbar offerings are fresh, cold and succulent
Jennifer, the bartender, is skilled and capable
This restaurant seems to attract lots of patrons who are in the restaurant business, which speaks volumes about its quality
The Alaskan King Crab Legs or the Maryland Crab Claws are my favorite entrees
always hits the spot! The oysters are great too
I remember there used to be at least a half hour wait for this place, but recently it seems that its gotten less crowded
Definitely a must-try if you're a crab fan
I took advantage of restaurant week and tried out City Crabs
The Lobster Bisque appetizer was not too fresh
My Pan Seared Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass was pretty good
Would not really recommend the Pan Roasted Prosciutto Wrapped Atlantic Monkfish
The monkfish was bland, and the Prosciutto taste came off too strong
The waitors weren't too cheerful or attentive
Overall, I had better dinning experiences else where
My fiance made reservations for dinner
Our server told us that one of four appetizers were sold out as well as 2 of the 4 entrees
My lobster bisque was served with no spoon so we had to point it out to our server
Anyway, he had the monkfish and I had the salmon
I was not impressed with the salmon, which was dry and tasteless
The caramelized banana on the creme brulee was great, but the creme brulee itself lacked a firmness I'm used to
The texture was strangely too mushy
All in all, we spent too much money between the both of us to have a blah dinner
This was the worst dining experience I've had in my four years of living in New York City
Went to take advantage of restaurant week, but upon getting menus we were told that they had run out of all but one entree
Service was slow and when we finally had changed our order to the regular menu, we were also informed that our selections from it were unavailable
All that trouble for changing our orders numerous times and the food wasn't impressive in the least
Our waiter had a sense of humor about the whole thing and was apologetic, but I will never go back and wouldn't recommend wasting the money or the time
I must say, I was impressed by the selection (about 4 choices for appetizers and entrees) as usually you are very limited for the $30
04 3 course special
We arrived around 5:15 so the restuarant was fairly empty and were seated right away
I had the jumbo shrimp cocktail which was very good
For the entree I had the pan seared chilean sea bass (so hard to find as it is endangered I believe) and it was fantastic
Succelent, flavorful and not overcooked
My friend had the salmon dish and was equally as pleased
Service was not the best, but we did stick to the special so I was not surprised
The tiramisu for dessert was very good, but the chocolate torte was dense, bitter and soggy - the only lowlight of the evening
The hostess had an attitude problem for no reason
We were not allowed t sit at a table since they were inbetween lunch and dinner on a sunday
They didn't have half the seafood that was offered on the menu
The seared tuna was almost black
The seafood is definitely not fresh
Must say it is one of the worst restaurants on Park Ave
I have been to many restaurants in NYC and I was looking forward to trying City Crab for the first time
My advice - skip it
The service was absolutely horrendous - it took 25 minutes just to have the waiter come over and give us menus
And, he wasn't even sure of the selection of crabs that they were serving that night
The food was just average
There are certainly better places to eat seafood in NYC
This was one of the worst dining experiences I can remember
For a better deal, walk 1/2 block south to Park Avalon - always a good bet
The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either
The Lobster special from 5 -7pm is a good deal, but the clams, mussels, and corn which were supposed to be hot, arrived not just cool, but cold
The waiter was a total tool
He highly recommended the horribly bland sole papillote, very diappointing
The hostess had a serious attitude problem for no apparant reason
New England Clam Chowder was top of the line, excellent
The seafood is outstanding, Alaskian King Crab legs is the way to go
The only bad thing is service, your waiter will disappear for ages, and forget about your thirst
Service is very very poor and slow
But if you want great crab legs this is the place to be
A bit pricey but casual, laid back and they have outside seating
Good for summer eating
We had the lobster special ($22
95 for a 2
5 pound lobster, clams, mussels, corn on the cob and red potatos)
They have the special from 5-7pm every day
The lobster was a bit dry but pretty tasty
It was a pretty good deal for all that food
Our waitress was fabulous and never kept us waiting or looking around for her (and we were even sitting outside)
Oh -- and Busta Rhymes was there
:0)
Wonderful food but a little pricey
Ambiance is nothing special
not a romantic place for a date but a good place for a big group
Service was a little slow but the food is worth the wait
Good crowd
We werefirst seated in the smoking section
If you do not specify you are places in smoking
The Clam Chowder was decent, but could have used more potatoes
Appitizer wasa samplerplatter
Shrimp were excellent, good size and flavor, but the stone crabs were lacking
They were clearly previously frozen and still a tad icy
Oysterswere not worth the money
The mussels were excellent, although the joy ended there
The clams wereoverdone and dry and you got asmall redpotato
Placed ontop of all this was the lobster, whichleft your potato soaking in lobster juice
The lobster was about the quality of China Town, butboiled in salt water to spice it up
Sadly, the lobster was overcooked as well and had very tough tail meat
Theservice wasn't good
Our server kept disappearing
If you have any taste in seafood please, go to Red Lobster and you will have a much better experience

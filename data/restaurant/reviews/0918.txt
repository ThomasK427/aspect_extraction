Same with the oysters
I recommend Sumile highly for a completely satisfying tour for your taste buds
If you want to impress someone take him or her here
Because it is tucked away and rather unassuming form the outside, youll impress them just by knowing its there
The food great and because everything is shareable, it is great for couples
The monk fish, oysters, and ebi are a must have
The wine list has something for just about everyone and they have a nice selection of sake too
after much debate because of the weather, a friend and i went to sumile last night and had (another) wonderful experience
the service was extremely attentive and the food amazing
this time i understood the menu concept (there are no actual entrees, but all small plates)--we each had 3 dishes, as recommended and shared the cheesecake for dessert
everything was fabulous, but the shrimp, hamachi w/ melon and sirloin stick out as favorites! you may not leave stuffed, but you'll leave extremely satisfied and waiting to go back!
Splitting five entree-sized portions at $14
00 per dish plus one bottle of wine at $40
00 (one of the least expensive on the menu), three of us ended up paying $47
00 per person with tax and tip
We left feeling both hungry and impoverished
The relationship between the price and the quality of the experience is inverse, which is unfortunate since we're always looking for good places in the neighborhood
This place was over hyped
The food is decent, but WAY TOO SMALL of portions for what you pay for
The pricing isn't quite clear and look out for that asterisk on the menu where they add on that extra 6-8 bucks
We were SHOCKED when our bill came out to over $200 and we were still hungry! Totally not worth it
After the glowing review of Sumile in the NYTimes, I was excited to check this place out
It was so overrated! A few of the dishes were tasty, but most were simply average
The room was very loud
It was extremely expensive
Don't bother!
If you'd like to spend over $ 200 for two (with only 2 drinks) and still leave a restaurant hungry, this is the place
The decor is fab and the waitstaff wonderful, but the restaurant is unbearably loud, the tables extremely close together and quite uncomfortable and the food is entirely overpriced
The food is wonderful, but we left still hungry, as the plates (are they appetizers?) are way too small
You'd have to spend well over $300 in order to feel like you had an actual meal
I loved my Sumile experience! The decor is cozy and sexy and the service was superb
The menu satisfies all types of appetites and tempts you to try something new! Great date place!
We had the most wonderful dining experience at Sumile the other night
To begin with, the decor and ambience was light and airy, yet still cozy and intimate-- not to mention the voyeuristic glass that gives us glimpes of the kitchen
But what we enjoyed most about the evening was the ultra creative menu-- each dish we tried was imaginative and delicious
Plus, the design your own tasting menu theme allowed us to indulge and share in so many of the great dishes
I highly recommend
Oh, and don't forget to check out their sake selection and yummy cocktails- all in all Sumile was a great dining experience
Fantastic experience at Sumile! The very knowledgeable servers help you make sense of the very interesting menu
The tapas-style plates allow you to try several of the one-of-a-kind dishes, each of which was extremely tasty and unique
The bean salad is definitely a must-have, and you can't go wrong with the beef
The New York meets South Beach decor make for a lively and fun atmosphere
truly pleasantly surprised by the execution and flavor coaxed out of smaller portions
subtle, refined and balanced
not one ingredient seemed dullish to me
and the whole night greatly impressed my lady friend
great job, gentlemen
In Short Yellow, red and orange-colored curtains dress the dining room, decorated with photographs of dancing Spanish women, accompanied by a mix of Latin sounds, like meringue and salsa
The restaurant prides itself on the sangria, and offers separate bar, lunch, dinner and dessert menus that feature Ecuadorian shrimp, churrasco (grilled beef), barbacoa (lamb), rainbow ceviche and sweet plantains
The chefs also dish out homemade ice creams and sorbets
Went on a Friday night for some dinner with friends
They have the BEST sangria and Mojitos I have had in a long time!!! The decor was modern, chic with good dim lighting
If dining, ask to sit in the main dining area as the bar stool area looks uncomfortable while the main dining area is outfitted with plush sofa chairs
Waiters are on point
The food is excellent
The octopus salad is amazing and the shrimp empanadas are good but, a bit on the small side
The pork entree isn't really that good but, the churrasco and the duck is to die for
Overall, an excellent dining experience that I highly recommend
anoche fui la lucy unos amigos me lo recomendaron y no sabes lo chevere que lo pase
ay PAPA quenoche la comida de lo maximo y los tragos ni que se digan
todo en el menu estava exquisito
no tengo palabras para desqrivir este restaurant
Quien es el chef?increible
I adore this restaurant! Food is excellent
I highly recommend the duck
Service is impeccable
I love the colombian bread they serve in the beginning
It's warm, dense, and yummy
The music is kickin' and the ambience and decor is trendy but comfy (just like the food)
I've also had the mojito samplers on a sunday night and you get a lot of liquor for your buck
Lucy Latin Kitchen has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants
Even the most well developed palate will be pleased! We just wandered in here when our Union Square Cafe reservation got lost
what a blessing b/c this spot is a true keeper
The service and food are top notch
we had a lamb shank and filet that were cooked to the most perfect temperatue
They treated us with such grace
I would return here weekly!
I have been to Lucy for years dining for dinner, lunch and dropping in for drinks by the lounge
On each occasion I bring friends and family from out of town and country
The service is consistently oustanding and the food is absolutely mouth melting and fresh
I have never been disappointed with the atmosphere, food and the service
The manager is one of the best in the industry, and the chef - one of a kind in Latin cuisine
On a cold sunday evening me and my friends were looking to liven up the night with a few cocktails and some live music
We got more than we bargained for when we stumbled across Lucy, lured in by the sounds of cuban drums and the bright array of colors bursting from inside
The laid back yet lively ambience was a perfect setting to one of the most pleasant evenings I have had in a while
We started with the empanada tasting, which being an Argentinean native, I'm always quite critical of, however I was pleasantly surprised how delicious they tasted, memories of home overcame my dining experience
(An insider's tip- if you say you are an ex patria customer, the delightful manager might just give you the dessert on the house!) After we'd filled our stomachs, we danced the night away to the live cuban band
We waited for about 20 minutes before anyone came to our table to give menus - then another 15 before we got water
Finally our waiter came and said Do you know what your going to eat? We asked about specials, and after he told us ordered and asked for a wine list
The manager seemed to notice that our waiter was not very attentive and came and took our wine order
Dont bother ordering the empanada sampler - it is 5 bite size portions for $15
Then our food came at about the same time
So we waited forever and then were bombarded with food
The cuban pork was cold and dry and tasteless
We had to track down the manager to get our check and scramble out
Overall a bad and expensive food experience
I cannot help but keep going back to Lucy since I discovered it a few weeks ago
The food is simply delicious, I love the barn style decor and the Latin music is also very cool
Although I really didn't want to leave the lounge area (which was full of fun and laughter), my table was well attended to by a delightful waitress and each plate was better than the one before
Being South American myself, Lucy has a fantastic sample of what our cuisine has to offer

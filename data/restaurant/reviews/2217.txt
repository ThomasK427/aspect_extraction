Whats great is they welcome your credit card
On a recent trip, walked up 9th avenue looking for little diner or coffee shop
Found the renaissance and ended up going back two more times
Typical diner fare, decent prices, good portions
Plus
they take a credit card! Get one of the three booths in the window in front and watch NYC pass you buy while you chow down
They serve breakfast all day and there's a counter
Lots of regulars came in for carryout
Larger room in back for bigger parties
A third shift co-worker on the west side introduced me to their menu
anything I wanted, when I wanted it at a price I could work with! I read the menu
ok, so you've got an indoor/outdoor dining area and working fire place
big deal
As long as my order was delivered promptly and correctly nothing else mattered
Well, I finally visited their facility (four years after the first take-out order)
I'm just in love with the adorable little diner's atmosphere as I am with their FOOD--at ALL hours of the day--AB-FAB and two thumbs up!
Since moving into the area, Renaissance has continued to be the chamption of round the clock dining
Great place to go after a night on the town or for an early breakfast
Service is good (even at 4am) and the portions are big
Usually you get a friendly staff member
The outside garden is nice to sit in and I highly recommend Peanut Butter Shakes
A wonderful diner
The service is phenomenal and the food is even better
Make sure to try their chicken salads, veggie burgers, and their sweet, sweet potatoe fries
You can have a great meal for $10 - 20 dollars
ENJOY!
This is a great little diner
great burgers, fries, diner breakfasts, etc
Cheap and convenient
This was a great Italian meal
We had a reservation (on a Tuesday night) and I would say you would always need it
It's a small place, and incredible
People came in and were waiting for a table and some left to a bar next door and were told when to come back
This was nice so no one was standing over you
Our group of 6 had all different food and everyone was raving about it
The waiters were friendly and fun, the whole experience was amazing
I will come back in the future
Only negative, of the four desserts we split, two of them weren't great, just ok
Great Italian food! Very cozy atmosphere, pretty casual
I had the mixed green salad, the bowtie pasta with bolengse sause with mozzeralla, and veal searved piccatta style (lemon, white wine, capers)
Excellent rustic Italian meal, very affodable, extremely welcoming waiters
My veal dish was not on the meu, but I told what I was looking for and they were more than happy to make it! My mom had the whole Sea Bass with raisins and capers! It came as a whole fish, scales, eyes and all, but were more than willing and expecting to de-bone and filet the fish! Truely home-cooked Italian!
I have eaten at La Vineria several times and every time the experience was amazing
After living in Italy for several months, this restaurant is the closest I've come to a true Italian experience
Do not go to La Vineria in a hurry - the waitstaff does enough to keep you happy but doesn't bother you ever second
The best dish is not listed on their menu - it is a special - the flat pasta with truffle mushroom sauce
Amazing!!! You will not go wrong with this quaint, Italian restaurant
We went to Patsys based on an old friend's recommendation
This is not the old Patsys! The place was crowded--we had a reservation still had to wait for over 20 minutes--there was not a nice place to wait--the host rudely motioned us over to the wall--backed up to a large crowd
The food marginal, the host was extremely condescending  rude
We were told by the restaurant that children were welcome--they were not--they were well-behaved but treated poorly by the staff
We were told that Patsys was not snobby--but found that it was--very much so
Also--they have a dress code--no shorts--fine--but the restaurant is not nice enough to demand a dress code was quite hot--I could have used some shorts!  There are so many great restaurants in NYC--avoid this one!
we returned after more than 10 years to find the restaurant packed with tables, noisy as could be, rushed service, great food, but not worth the price
Today there are just too many other good restaurants around that Patss's has lost it draw for us
They are no longer a standout, must go spot
LIving on ther reputation form the days hwen good restaurants really stood out
We were told we had to go to Patsy's and we are very glad we listened! The ambience, service, and value were typical NYC, and the food was outstanding
The portions are huge, so make your decision on an appetizer or dessert before you order
I could not finish my entree, but I was going for the dessert cart, no matter what! If you go for lunch as we did, get there when they open as seating is fairly limited
Do yourself a favor and put Patsy's on your must see list
Excellent food and service from a bygone age
The waiters are adults and appear to be professionals
The food was outstanding and the service prompt
Don't miss the cheesecake
And don't go without reservations
MY BEAUTIFUL LOVE BARBARA AND MYSELF DINED HERE ON THIS PAST HALLOWEEN NIGHT (2004) BEFORE A BROADWAY SHOW, I'M BORN AND RAISED IN NYC, I'VE ALWAYS MEANT TO DINE HERE HOWEVER I THOUGHT BY IT'S REPUTATION THAT I'D HAVE TROUBLE GETTING IN, THIS IS NOT THE CASE, PATSY'S IS QUITE WELCOMING, TREATED US AS CELEBRITIES
BARBARA AND I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH FANTASTIC, SATISFYING, SUPERB, FLAVORFUL CUISINE, IT WAS INCREDIBLE
THE SERVICE WAS OUTSTANDING FROM THE MINUTE WE WALKED IN THE DOOR AND THE VALUE WAS SURPRISING, FOR UNDER A HUNDRED DOLLARS WE HAD AN APPETIZER, WINE AND AN ENTREE, SA-WEET! I SHALL RETURN A THOUSAND TIMES
Two of us had the most wonderful lunch before our Broadway show Wicked
Sal was absolutely wonderful telling us all about the celebs he has met over the years
Also my partner didn't know what to have for lunch and Sal was a big help in her selection
We saw a celeb and his wall of fame
The meal was perfect and so was the dessert (better then sex)
Recommend it for lunch if you are looking for a great place to eat and see a celeb or two
Sal thanks for being such a great host
6 of us visited NYC last week and we had dinner at Patsy's Friday night
We were seated promptly by the hostess
We saw a couple of celebs towards the back of the room
We enjoyed our meal and felt the price was reasonable
The only dissappointment was the cheesecake that our friend said tasted like pound cake
He requested to take it off our bill and they did
I would recommend this place for others to try
Who knows you might see a celebrity too
One can either buy into the hype or go to a good Italian restaurant
Food is very average and prepared hasitly (my stuffed calamari still had it cartiledge inside)
A million celebrities have visited the place, so if that's what you're looking for (a place to be seen), then this place is for you
I must say how DISSAPPOINTED all 12 of us were with this VERY BAD restaurant! Within 2 minutes of looking at the menu, a waiter comes over and says I hope everyone is ready to order! The waiter even left the check before he asked us if we wanted dessert or coffee
Even while we were eating, waiters were trying to take our plates with food still on the plate!! The older couple at the front could care less about you
If you are not a famous actor, they won't even look at you! I would say this was the WORST dinning experince I have ever had in the city
Even the prices are outrageous for a horrible restaurant
(ie
chicken parm
that does NOT come with pasta is $ 28
if you want pasta add another $ 8) the decor
I felt like it was 1985
TERRIBLE!
There may be better Italian joints in Manhattan, but I love it in terms of the convenience in Midtown and the reliable quality
My favorites are the Spedino for appetizer (although most people won't care for the anchovy sauce) and linguine pesto (the best pesto I've been able to get in the city)
All the pasta dishes are consistently good and if you're adventurous, even the tripe is excellent

Should have left then, but friends like the food
With so many other places w/ service and food worth waiting for in NYC, you'd think Cupping Room would care about their service to their customers
It is rather annoying to tip a waitress 20% and then have her glare at you as she counts the cash
And she was not very helpful in the first place
Not the friendliest atmosphere I have encountered
Reading the other reviews it seems like this place is a bit of a potluck in terms of service
Be warned
This place has one of the most relaxed vibes of any other soho restaurant
The sat
sun
brunches are great can be busy
Dinners are very relaxed romnatically candle lit
There is also a cafe if you want to sit and have coffee desert
If you want to chill in Soho this is the place to go
I love both the day night time vibe
Taking it back to what Soho use to be before it got glamorized
This is my favorite place to go for brunch in New York, by far! They're always packed on Saturdays and Sundays, but the service is still great and the staff is really friendly (not to mention VERY attractive)
The only drawback I can find to this pot of gold at the end of SoHo's rainbow is the somewhat obnoxious brand of prissy downtown clientele that it seems to draw, but, if you position your extra large latte cup in just the right way, it's easy to make their waif-like bodies dissappear
Don't forget to try a Bloody Mary-- they really are the best in SoHo!!!
Some friends told me about Wednesday night at the Cupping Room Cafe
Great Mediterranean music and food
We were dancing on the tables and having a great time
Warm and friendly atmosphere
Highly recommended
Our dining experience at the Cupping Room Cafe was very pleasant! The food was great! The service was warm and friendly! Nobody rushed us - and we spent a leisurely 2 hours eating and socializing
The turkey burgers were out of this world!!!! I highly recommend this wonderful Soho restaurant
Met a friend for a late Sunday lunch and thought a salad would hit the spot for summer
The lunch got a little bizarre when we asked the waiter how the joint got it's name, and he made his hands into cups in reference to placing them on a woman's breasts and said, No, not this
(Granted he apologized later, explained the real story, and was cool if not overly solicitous
) None of the salads appealed so I ordered simple spinach with calamari
$15 would have made logical sense *at most*, but the salad came to $20, which seemed bizarre, and the manager when I questioned him out of curiosity was weirdly passive aggressive about correcting the bill
Totally weird joint; trust the worst service reviews others have posted
There a zillion places I would rather revisit, including my home kitchen, than ever return here
This is my favorite brunch place in Soho
The food is great (especially the eggs Benedict) and they have an extensive bloody mary menus
The ambiance is wonderful and the waitstaff is highly unpretensious
And while this is a great Brunch place, they do a great job with the dinner, as well
If you are dinning alone, the bar is a great place to eat
My favorites are the steak and Chicken dishes
The salmon is wonderful, too
Each dish has a slight Middle Eastern flair to it
And if you like to drink, they have a great selection of both wines and spirits
plus, it attracts a fairly cool crowd
I went for dinner on a Sunday and had the worst dining experience ever
The waiters were extremely rude and completely inept
No one even apolgized for spilling water on me TWICE
They then brought my vegertarian friend lamb ravioli instead of mushroom
My salad with tuna showed up with no tuna
Again, no apology
When the manager finally came over he was even ruder than the waiters and said if the service was bad don't tip the waiter
I would not recommend going here at all
Even if the food was fantastic, which it wasn't, it could not make up for this awful service
I went here with two of my friends for dessert (which was still not cheap)
The restaurant had plenty of other tables available and the waitress and another waiter kept coming to us asking if we were done
Why offer us a table in the back room of you want us to leave it so quickly?! It seemed odd and uncalled for
Cupping Room is such a GREAT brunch place
The place has a great feel to it, the food is always good, service is always fast, and the location is great
It's always packed with a fun crowd
One of the best veggie burgers I've ever had (offered with a number of great toppings)
perfect lunch spot in soho, very cool ambience, food was great, service was quick and good and food was really creative and good
best part was the food was so reasonably priced
in soho nonetheless!
Met friends there for lunch who arrived an hour before me and ordered drinks and appetizers
Then we all ordered lunch
Wait staff started swarming around us as if we just ordered cokes throughout lunch
After finishing, the manager promptly handed us the bill
The waitress came over and said, You know you were here two hours and I want to make sure you know that
No one said anything about time limits on the tables
They said they only had 3 tables, which was a lie because there's a whole back area
How can this place operate like that when all of downtown has been crying about business being slow? They should be grateful they have a business! Our bill was $100, not $20, so there was no reason to be treated that way
With too many great places in the city, DON'T choose this loser!
This place is great! The management friendly, the food like home-cooking but BETTER, and good value on the prix-fixe
Whenever I have guests visiting, this is where I take them
Time after time, we are not let down
The restaurant is quite spacious and you would never expect to walk into such a large place in the middle of mulberry
TRY IT, I've been going for years and LOVE IT!
I have never been more disappointed by an Italian restaurant
And the fact that this restaurant can compete with delicious Italian restaurants in Little Italy is beyond me
The salad was so salty that I could barely get it down
And I'm not quite sure how they managed this, but their pasta sauce had absolutely NO taste
I guess they used up all the salt on the salad and had none left over for the sauce
As far as I was concerned, it may as well have been red food dye on the pasta
The entrees left MUCH to be desired
A total waste
My Husband and I come here EVERYTIME we are in from Long Island
The fact that it is roomy and you don't feel like you are sitting on top of the people next to you like the rest of Mulbery Street restaurants is A+! Large restarant MEANS quicker seating than others and food is to die for
The Chicken Anise is the absolute best and the Mozzerella en Carrozza is teriffic
A perfect meal and in Little Italy it's a perfect date!
i brought some visiting family here because everything else on the street was packed
now i know why this wasn't
the service was just ok, and the appetizers and bread were awful
although the entree portions were pretty large (the pork chop was big in particular) the presentation and quality were not up to par
there was no scene or ambiance to speak of - i would expect to find this place more at home in times square
Wow, I cannoy say enough good things about Sal Anthony's
When my folks visited from Florida they wanted to eat in Little Italy and frankly we could not get into my personal favorite - Il Nido - anyway
I was very pleasantly surprised
The host and wait staff was excellent
The food was great and the atmosphere is nearly unequaled in the city
We love Sal Anthony
After hearing this was a great restaurant I was extremely disappointed

I first arrived to Pintxos to meet friends after work and the place was empty, after a pitcher of the best sangria, I met one of the chefs/cooks,Eder, who I met again just recently at Tia Pols, now I get it
Well let me say that they share something
I love Pintxos beacuse its a small boutiqe spot because if you come early a weekday with a group the waitstaff makes you feel very VIP
You feel as if you are on vacation
The giant Pawns are sooo fresh with the shells on, the patata Bravas I loved, the cod croquettes were rich and creamy
and the stuffed mussels just like the ones I had in Madrid, and the baby lamb chops were fingure lickin'
Oh! Oh! If you are brave enough you MUST have the BABY EEL
The all Spanish wine list will have me back soon
This place is small its great for groups no larger than 8-10
So,be there or be square!
First of all, one of the reviewer said about sketchy neigborhood
I don't know what this reviewer is talking about
It was good relief from, trendy, crowded , muscle land of Tribecca! Tiny but very homey feeling
Food was great
Didn't mind taking shells off from giant Pawns
It was fun!! Sangria was great, but I hoped it has more variety of fruits in there
Will go back in no time!!
As a frequent restaurant goer I am always delighted to return to Pinxtos
It reminds me of lazy days I have spent in the Basque country
I espcially love the croquettes, which are a little bit of heaven
The salad with mushrooms, serrano ham, and shrimp are another favorite; it's a pleasant salad delight
When I am feeling more adventurous, I love the squid in it's own ink plate
My fiancee loves the perfectly cooked filet w/ cabrales blue cheese sauce
I try to go to Pintxos as often as I can to enjoy the savory food and drink the amazing sangria
This family-run spot is one of my favorite places
I love the simplicity and high quality of the small plates here
The pulpo (octopus) is simply the best in the city and the croquettes are a savory, creamy delight
Everything is fresh (except, unfortunately, the canned white asparagus on one of the salads) and simply, beautifully prepared
The portions are just right and made to order (if you spend a lot of time at places where the words all you can eat figure prominently on the menu, or the food is served on a heated table under a sneeze bar, this is not the place for you)
Fab wine list, excellent REAL sangria -- red and white -- perfect crusty bread and good olive oil to start
Tiny and quiet -- not the place if you're looking for the scene
I took an out-of-town friend there on a Thursday night around 9ish and it was DEAD
The neighborhood was sketchy too, the cab driver looked scared for us as we got out
The octopus was very fatty and we had to shuck the prawns ourselves
I had that fishy smell on my fingers all night
Our drinks were overpriced and we left there unsatisfied
If you do go I recommend the Atun salad- it was very good
2 years ago, the food was great
the black paella was especially good
i went there 2 weeks ago and all six plates were barely edible
the only fruit in the sangria were lemon particles
everything was too salty cold by the time it arrived and the waiter had a face disorder
he looked miserable and couldnt put on a smile or look friendly
I love this place, it is like eating in your Spanish Grandmother's kitchen
The staff is so great, the food is wonderful, and they have the most amazing white sangria! be sure to get a cheese plate
We always go in groups of 8-12 for birthday dinners
The restaurant was absolutely great in it's ambience, traditional cooking, great prices, etc
etc
Really had zero complaints
We liked that the menu didn't try to appease the American taste buds stuck with the traditional Basque receipes
I had a great steak my wife had the prawns we both loved it
The chorizo appetizer was awesome altho incredibly unhealthy but who cares
What makes this place is the ambience, in a quaint little part of town, the small dining area probably serves 30 at most is a perfect place for a romantic dinner
Queria casar Pintxos!! I went there on my 2nd day in New York ever for a quick lunch and ended up staying and chatting with the owners wife and a waiter, Javi for two hours
It was amazing
The food was great: rustic breads, deep rioja wines, spicy gambas, tasty basque pintxos
mmm!  Overall a great place to have a cafe con leche with a friend!
Is the secret ingredient in the stuffed mussels Tostitos brand cheese in a jar? Both my husband and I thought so
They were also missing the mussels in them
The octopus was pretty decent
The menu is pretty small and I would have liked to have seen more typical pintxos from the Basque region
The place is super cramped
I was pretty much sitting with my back against the wall
I can't imagine it when it's packed
The first time we went here, it automatically became our new favorite restaurant
The food was amazing, and the prices and service were great
The place is tiny, so I wouldn't go with a group, but it's a must-try
A small tiny place - but the food is absolutely excellent!! I had the Gambas (shrimp), the Spicy Mussels, and the Spicy Chorizo - everything was extremely flavorful and tasty
The service was also quite attentive and personal
And the Sangria was delicious! Oh and did I mention that this is a great value?! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a casual, inexpensive, and delicious meal
Check it out =)- Ro
Very good food, with amazing service
As a bonus, the place has the most awesome champagne sangria, with exquisite little slivers of strawberries in it
DO NOT GO WITH OUT IT
I just went there with my girlfriend for Valentine's on the advice of a coworker who had a FAB review for it
I went in there with HIGH expectations and Pintxos met every one of them! The food was incredible (recommend Tapas - stuffed mussels, filet on a steak)
Service was great
Only issue is that the place isn't that romantic and it's a bit crowded
Still, it's great for a dinner for 2 or 4 and it's a GREAT value
LOVE the place
I have spent quiet eves with just another person as well as my birthday with 20 people in this little gem
Truly tasty food and wine and a wonderful atmosphere
In Short This bright corner spot continues to draw crowds all day and late into the night
The roast meats are popular, particularly the crisp-skinned baby pig
Greens are basic and noodles, naturally, are a favorite with diners
When summer comes, the salt-baked soft-shell crab is as much of a New York ritual as a trip to Coney Island
This is not someplace you go for ambiance or romance--there isn't any
You come here for the great shrimp wonton (everywhere else adulterates their's with pork, this place doesn't) or sui gao
Or their Hong Kong-style roast meats, beef tendons, congee and shrimp fried rice
Staff can be curt but if you know what you want, you'll be okay
Knowing the language also helps
Another thing nice about this place are its opening hours: 9am to 3:30am
Great for late night munchies/cravings
The Food is pretty good but the service is so bad it's just not worth the wait
I would only go there for take outs on a late night when everything else is closed
Even the cashier has an attitude problem
The most amazing chinese food I have ever had!!! Great prices (about 5 or 6 bucks for a meal) !!!!! It is amazing food and would go back in a second!
she may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts
you can practically pick an item at random off of the menu and you'll really like it
I love this place

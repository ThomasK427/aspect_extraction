The pizza here is great
Hands-down excellent
Pasta not extraordinary but good
Pizza is orginal and affordable
yum!
Being a saltaholic I discounted other reviewers comments on various sites about the crust being too salty
But they were right
Not only was it salty it was as dry as dirt
and burned to a unappetizing crisp
I had the Beacon, and the toppings were bland
I could have made a better pizza in an easy bake oven
My friend had the mozzarella and tomato penne
Another thumbs down
No flavor and also burned
Yes, it is possible to burn pasta
I work in the area, and the other reviewer is right that there's not much around here, but any other choice would be better
I would eat at the McDonald's across the street before I ever eat at this place again
while i love thin crust brick oven or wood fired pizza, this one fails to meet its potential
one, the crust is prebaked so it's like eating a pizza made on a pita, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the crust was a little too salty for me
it left a salty and prune like feeling on my lips when i was done
two, it's 4 dollars for a margarhita slice which is about the same size as one big reg slice from any pizza joint
so 4 is a bit much, 3 would make more sense
overall, it's not horrible, but not great, and considering that there are very few good places to eat right around there, it's not a bad choice if you're right in the area, but not a place to make a journey to
The Scene A grey tin ceiling, white walls and a white tile floor--the marble-topped tables are as dressy as the pizza joint gets, but no matter
The main event, the authentic wood-fired brick oven, glows enticingly from the back of the room, with its heavily tattooed, well-trained guardian transferring pies to the dining room's lone server
The Food The charred but chewy crust pays homage to the Napoli pizza it mimics and stands up to the generous application of rich olive oil
Made from naturally leavened flour and mixed by hand with Sicilian sea salt, it is the springboard for restaurant's fabulous pies
Diners choose from just four stellar pies--the Marina, Margherita, Bianca and Filetti--whose topping combinations shift every so subtly and never veer from the classic ingredients of tomatoes (sourced from San Marzano or fresh cherry tomatoes), buffalo mozzarella, olive oil, oregano, basil, garlic and sea salt
My cook boyfriend and I were so excited to try this place on our first trip to NYC -- and being from Seattle, we were looking forward to trying some real, authentic pizza rather than what often only suffices in the Emerald City
Our mouths dropped open at the prices (18
95 for a PERSONAL pizza?), and we were very disappointed by the selection of pizza and beverages on the menu
I can agree with other people who've rated this joint -- the waiter is very pretentious and a little hard to handle
NONE THE LESS: The pizza is mouth-wateringly amazing and I am still craving just one more pizza
The presentation was lacking, the restuarant was very poorly decorated and had no ambiance whatsoever -- but O! the pizza! If you crave an ethereal, albeit very expensive pizza experience and don't mind sitting in a rather dull and shockingly bare setting with waitstaff that does not cater to any ideals of customer service, I would reccomend coming here
I'll admit ashamedly that, despite the high prices, etc
I would be a regular customer if I lived in NYC
words really CANNOT describe how good this pizza is
there is not enough that can be said to do this food justice
you must just go and see (TASTE!) for yourself
really
utterly
amazing
while 18 dollars per 12 inch pie sounds expensive, one taste and you would gladly pay more
yes
it is THAT good
everyone else making pizza in the city take note: this place is embarassing you all
BADLY
As my Neopolitan grandpa says, you don't like? ok, more for me! This place has the best pizza (even better than in Italy!)
Also the atmosphere is intentionally really chill, but with the intention of you having a great experience
I don't know how anyone can complain about either the food or the ambience
We recently decided to try Una Pizza Napoletana after seeing it listed on a Best Pizza in the USA list
The pizza was excellent--definitely some of the best we've had in the US and in Italy; BUT, no individual-sized pizza is worth 18
95!! We didn't even get real glasses for our water--just flimsy plastic ones
A neighborhood pizzeria like this should seat patrons on a first-come, first-served basis
We were actually asked to wait outside (inhaling 2nd hand smoke) even though there was a table for 2 available
Even though we live just a few blocks away, we will very likely never go back--we'll just save our money for a trip to Naples
The pizza here is excellent
You can taste every fresh ingredient and I appreciate that they are strict in the way their pizza is served
On the other hand it is overpriced, they charge you for water and the waiter (who may be the owner because he is ALWAYS there) acts like he is doing you a favor by waiting on you and never acknowledges when he's made a mistake
I have given this place a few chances and have brought different friends only to realize it's a shame when a waiter consistently sucks so bad that it takes you out of what could be a great dining experience
The pizza was just OK - I've had better at most $2 a slice walk-in places - in fact, I left wishing that I had gone to the take out place on the corner instead
The service was absolutely awful - although they told us that they pizzas should take less than 5 minutes to cook, they took 50 minutes to come, even after we put in our orders - despite the fact that we were the first in line before we sat down! The staff spent time talking to their friends instead of making our pizza, with the result that they didn't even get our order right (pretty difficult to do when there are only 4 items on the menu!)
By the very nature of how difficult it is to get to this place when it is open and still has pizza, I am sure this is a place adored by those annoying chowhounds
aka food doggies
Living on the block, I wanted to takeout
The owner (with 4 days of leisure time a week) made me wait to place an order so he could clear a table, then he beckoned me over to him and did not allow me to place an order b/c I did not have the cash on me at the time
I understand that access freaks in New York and mopre frequently now in New Jersey tend to like to boast about difficult culinary adventures, and yes the pizza is good, but you don;t need to jump through hoops or to be made to wait like this
there is other good pizza out there without the fuss
I had extremely high hopes for this place
On paper it had all the right ingredients for killer pie
on the plus side the ingredients are excellent and very high quality
But IMHO I ultimately rate this restaurant as average for the following reasons:  1
Extremely pricey! maybe its the cost of top ingredients but 17
00 for a pizza the size of a bar pie?  2
too limited
NO toppings of any kind
I guess the owner is a purist and that's his perogotive, but at 16
95 offer some toppings!  3
No crunch to the pie
and this is from a guy that grew up in Jersey! NJ has some of the best, crunchiest thin crust pie around
I like the crust and the pie to have some crunch
this pie had NONE
If you have ever been to Naples you will know what the pizza is like:sublime
This is the closest I've gotten outside that great city
The pizza is fantastic! Just as in Naples, there are only four kinds, so you don't have to worry about overwhelming choices
The drawbacks are the weird service (the one waiter seems to be totally out of it) and the price- in Naples it cost 5 Euros for a pizza and a beer, here the pizza alone is $17
Good for 4 people or under, with a little cash to burn
Similar to the soup nazi on Seinfeld, this restaurant gives you no choices
It doesn't een offer free water
You must BUY a bottle of water to wash down the salty pizza
Our party of six was made to wait 45 minutes for seating, and then an additional hour for our pizza to arrive
We were split into two groups, yet our food was put on one check
Which meant the wrong pizzas were delivered to the wrong tables
Finally, one table's order was taken incorrectly leaving out a pizza
When we asked for the forgotten pizza, we were told there was no more dough
The one positive note is that the extra pizza was eventually delivered
But because we were a large party, the tip was automatically included on the bill
We had no choice in even deciding the TIP
This is not the place to order a pie loaded down with toppings
In fact, you can't even try

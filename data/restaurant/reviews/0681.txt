it was okay, but i think i'll stick to regular ketchup
After the review in the Times, I felt I had to try the California style burgers at Blue 9
Along with two fellow Californians, we each ordered the Blue 9 burger (a Double Double), fries and milk shakes
The burgers were great! Good taste, melted cheese, thick tomato slices
The fries were similar to their Califonian cousins, but a little cold
Milk shakes were hand made and tasted like it
Blue 9 makes a great burger, without the wait of Corner Bistro
now if only they'd start serving beer
I was very pleased with Blue 9
The price is right and the service is about as good as you'll get from an order-at-the-counter-get-a-number method
There may be those out there who sweat the West coast too much to admit it, but this is a solid In Out Burger surrogate for East coasters
The fries are only okay, but who cares? The double and a choc
shake won't disappoint
The food is nothing compared to In and Out
This is nothing but a cheap imitation that is overpriced
Unlike In and Out, the patty is not fresh (a frozen taste) and as thin as a McDonald's hamburger
The fries are absolutely the worst of any burger joint that I know (and I know of many on both coasts)
The fries are noticeably laden with old staled oil and way too salty
The service (or lack thereof) is another turnoff
I waited over 15 minutes for my simple order that consisted of a cheeseburger, fries, and a small coke
The food isn't cheap either
A cheeseburger, Fries, and a Coke will cost you over $6
00 -- It's expensive, therefore, there won't be as much turnover, therefore, the food will NOT BE FRESH
If you have a craving for a west coast style burger, you should make a trip to Corner Bistro!
The Scene Carved into Eli's Manhattan (Eli Zabar's upscale food emporium), this comfortably elegant restaurant has quickly become a neighborhood mainstay
It's a self-service commissary by day, but Frette linens and votive candles show up during the dinner hour, creating a more sophisticated ambience to which the well-groomed clientele is accustomed
The spacious bar, with its own menu of small plates and a lengthy list of wines by the glass, is a boon to single diners
The Food The menu changes nightly, depending on what's in season
Standards include a salad of heirloom tomatoes culled from Zabar's rooftop garden, oven-roasted mushrooms and a juicy grilled pork chop
Preparation and presentation tend to be simple, allowing the flavors to speak for themselves
The lemon meringue cake--a gargantuan showpiece meant for sharing--is the highlight of the dessert menu
After reading the great reviews, I invited a die-hard downtown friend of mine to join me at TASTE
What a pleasant surprise! The wine list was superb, our tapas delightful, and the quiet atmosphere perfect for good conversation
We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the cheese plate
I came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience
I'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu!
If you need to be on the Upper East side at all, this is a delightful spot
The wine comes in Spieglau or Riedel-- enough said about the wine
The food arrives in small plates so no need to overindulge and yet still explore a variety of samplings
The staff graciously host and add to a warm atmosphere
Though definitely not cheap, the food and service were more than worth it
Wine list was excellent and unusual, but the very knowledgeable waitstaff was happy to guide us through it
We tried three wines, of which my personal favorite was the rather oddly named The Stump Jump
Even more impressive, when my vegetarian girlfriend started asking whether certain dishes were made with meat, the waiter offered to have a vegetable plate created for her -- and it was quite well done too
We finished off with a huge slice of lemon meringue pie
The decor is worth a special mention
What is most notable is the creative use of space and mirrors to enhance the size of the dining room, though of equal import is a willingness not to cram the maximum possible number of seats into the place, an area in which many restaurants in Manhattan fail abysmally
Thanks Citysearch, I just found the best wine bar
Great wines by the glass and menu to match
An inexpensive way to enjoy a good night with a friend or two
Don't miss the infamous Lemon Meringue cake for dessert
It is meant to share, trust me!!
My husband took me here for a romantic dinner; it was a magical night
We were seated on the balcony in the back
My huisband ordered a bottle of wine, which was delicious
He had the steak and loved it I had solmon in mustard sauce that was just right
The ambience and service were superb
We went to see Spamalot afterwards, which completed this romantic evening with laughs
Wonderful restaurant with terrific food and wine providing unpretencious and curteous service
Bravo!
I live close and dine there quite often; it's one of my favorite places in Hell's Kitchen
I abslutely love the pizza here - it's amazing, the crust is thin and crispy, the tomatoe suace is phenomenal
They also have very good wines and fast and friendly service
I highly recommend it
I went to this place because it was right near where my friend and I were going to a show later
I ordered the spinach ravioli and he a pizza
The ravioli was the better of the two, but the serving was tiny, and the skin a bit rubbery
The pizza was quite terrible
The vegetables on top was not seasoned at all, and tomato sauce blander than the supermarket kind
Service was fast
I am puzzled by the good reviews
With all the better Italian restaurants nearby, I don't understand how this place stays in business
We read good things about this restaurant but the food was very mediocre
It took way too long to be served, they seemed to be unable to handle the crowd they had, and the chicken we ordered tasted microwaved and the mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a box
The pasta was also nothing special
In a city with great Italian restaurants, it was a real disappointment
What a wonderful, cozy little place
I live in the neigborhood and I've been coming to Cascina for quite a few years now
I love the pizza and the steak
Pastas are great as well
I love it for the great wine and affordible prices
The atmosphere is just so cozy and homey
Service is always friendly and fast
Just a great place
I love this neighborhood cozy Italian place
The staff is so friendly and welcoming
The atmosphere is just great
I love the food even more
The pizza is amazing
The steak is great
I also had some pastas and loved them
Desserts are amazing too, especially the home made tiramisu
The brick pizza oven gives the restaurant character and adds to the homey decor
The wines from their own label are great
The best part is, its all very affordible, so you can have great meals, close and often and it won't break your bank
Oh, that's refreshing
Three of my grilfriends and I had pre-theater dinner at Cascina last week
We all loved it
That was the best thin crust pizza we ever had! The stripe bass was amazing
We shared a tiramisu, berry tart and a pear tart all homemade and phenomenal

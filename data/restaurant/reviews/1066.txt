Overall I rate this place an 8 out of 10
It's hard to find a cool restaurant these days without dealing with all the trendy bull---t that goes with it
Thanks Earl's
I tried eating at this place on 4 separate occasions, hoping the past experiences were just flukes
Sorry to say, the food just wasn't any good, including the bar foods/appetizers
Even the burgers didn't taste right
They were either too bland or dry, or too cold and tasteless
The atmosphere is good (especially on nice days when you manage to get outdoor seating), and it's a pretty good place to catch a sports event or just hang out and drink
Just don't come here hungry
I ordered the ribs, greens and sweet mashed potatoes
I truly fell in love with the rub, it was the best I've ever tasted
I couldn't finish my dinner there so I took my doggy bag back to the hotel
I finished it for brunch that sunday and it was just as good if not better than the night before
I tried the red velvet cake and BOY, WAS I DISAPPOINTED! It was very dry, very very dry
However, that BBQ rub is off the chain
So here is a tip for all who like sweet mashed potatos: bake them in the oven at 400-425 for 1 hr, peel skin off, mix in butter and a little sugar [optional]
delish! Also another tip for cakes: add a box of dry jell-o pudding [vanilla for white/yellow cakes, chocolate-chocolate cakes, lemon-lemon cakes, etc]
ENJOY!  Thanks Earl's it was a great experience
Went with my girlfriend yesterday to quench a BBQ craving
This place obliterated it! Kudos to the rub they put on those finger lickin' good ribs
AND
I had Collard Greens for the first time
Holy Cow
that was some great greens
The Sweet Mashed Potatos were also a delight
My girl had the Pulled Pork Sandwich
and yes
I snuck a bite
YUM!  The dessert was bland (Chocolate Pecan pie)
They should consider chopping their nuts instead of halving them, but that's my only food complaint
Oh, and the service can be a little slow, but they are very friendly and nice
The service was great
Although the restaurant was crowded, the waitress was very attentive
The pulled pork sandwich was good, not the best I've had in the city
The southern atmosphere looked more like a truck stop
I ordered the red velvet cake for dessert and it was nothing more than Betty Cocker's yellow cake mix with red food coloring and store bought icing
As a southerner, I am disgusted that they are passing this off as red velvet cake and charging $5
00 for it
Go here for the BBQ and leave the red velvet cake to the south
I was just there for a private holiday party and had the best time
The food was great and ofcourse the open bar made the night interesting
Anyway Earl's would be a great place to come to on a regular night
The staff was also very nice and friendly, hope to see them on a regular night
How can a restaraunt run out of wings? Twice! I am a big fan of this place however wings are not something a restaraunt should run out of
Fresh lobster yes, wings
no
the food was not bad
the mac and cheese was great
however, we saw our waitress once the entire night
forget help after you are seated
didn't place our order for almost half and hour and it wasn't even busy
had to ask the host for the check because the waitress was sitting at another table taking their order
Only go to this place if you want good drinks, mac and cheese and pigs in a blanket
NOTHING else is good here - NOTHING
THe service is good and the TV's provide adequate sports watching, but eat first - then eat MAC and Cheese and drink alot
I'm glad Earls opened up in this part of town, there is finally a bar, restaurant that is great for having scrumptious food with a comfortable view of the TV's
Just what this area needed
Plus my girl friends and I can catch Monday night football there
how cute are the girls? try the route 66 with a beer they have pabst blue ribbon in cans? how cool is that  I like this place alot, food is really good
This place is a nice
However, my ribs/chicken combo came out piping cold
The place is very loud, good for drinks by the bar not to eat and yell
I would not go back
I am a huge yankee fan, gotta love going to earls, watch a big game, eat great wings and have cute girls serve me beer
I had dinner at earl's the other night with some friends
The service was not the best, but the girls were really cute and nice
The food was great, I have'nt had a good sandwich like the route 66 in a long time
A must try if you live in the area
The food is really good! Big BIG portions and very good prices  My wife loves the big chopped salads, lots of good stuff in them  Fun place and a great addition to the murray hill area
A fun bar scene, great place to hang for a couple of beers and a burger
Plus the girls are cute
Although Earl's just opened, and there are always opening kinks, I doubt I'd give it another shot
Service is slow (although pleasant), food is not good and drinks are awful
The sidewalk seating allows for good people-watching, and since you'll be waiting an hour for your food and drinks, at least it gives you something to do
THIS PLACE IS GREAT, FROM THE FOOD TO THE LOVELY LADIES THAT CARRY THE BUTTERMILK CHICKENS
I CAN CATCH ALL YANK GAMES AND SEARCH FOR MY ETERNAL BUZZ THERE
I WILL SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT EARLS, ITS A SPOT THAT IS WORTH ALL THE HYPE THAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT
Claiming to be a down home, southern place, this restaurant had NONE of the southern hospitality I was hoping for
The hostess was rude, and was talking to her friends for a good 10 minutes before she even recognized that there were others waiting
Their big ass 16oz drinks were prob no more than 10oz and not worth the $8
50
The salad was boring and the service was just plain bad
I hope that it gets better, because the location is good, and no one wants a bad neighborhood place
First time there I'll admit service was mediocre but honestly were not rating a 5 star restaurant, it's a fun casual spot
The music, atmosphere and the staff are great
I've been there 5 times since they have opened and things are getting much better
I think Earl and I will become great friends
I went the first time and the service and food was spotty at best but this being a brand new restaurant in the neighborhood filled with the City's toughest critics, I thought I'd give it another shot
Very pleased
My waitress, Lorna, was VERY friendly and although the food took a little bit, it was cheap and well worth the wait
Friends had told me that the service was disengaged, so I had my doubts
But I was hoping for some decent food
I had chicken fried steak (a personal favorite of mine), which was inedible
I rarely complain about bad food and have on only rare occasions been served something I couldn't eat, but this was definitely one of those times
My friend's fried chicken breast wasn't nearly as bad, to be fair
But the waitress's response, Sorry, but I don't cook the food, wasn't what I was looking for
The manager was very nice about everything, but I won't be coming back
It's just too darn bad
In the words of the waitress herself: I am the worst waitress ever
Waited an hour for our food

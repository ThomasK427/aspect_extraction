I went to Josie's for the first time 1 year ago and find myself back there almost every week
It is a great place to take a date or go with your friends
The atmosphere is extremely cosy and trendy with a friendly staff
The menu and food make the restaurant a 10 - healthy; affordable; different; huge selection to choose from including Pastas; fishes; chicken and beef
The fact that this place is in Murrey Hill make it a sure winner in the area
The only problem I encountered was on Mother's Day; we had a horrible waitress
Our food was wrong and service was slow
The manager gave us a free meal
That's Customer Service!!
Food is great
Organic/health conscious type of menu with a good variety and decent prices
Ambiance is fabulous--very trendy decor and great, young crowd
Service is impeccable
Great drinks too! By far my favorite restaurant in Manhattan!
Business must be too good to bother treating customers well
Not only does this place not keep reservations, but you do not even hear an apology for making you wait by the bar to make you spend more money bec
their table is not ready
The hosts are simply rude
This place should not even have the same name as its west side sister establishment, which is excellent
Next time, do like I do and walk out when treated poorly
Stick with the West Side Josies
i've been dining at da ciro for 7 years
the food is always delecious , and the service friendly
a recent added plus is the new host, anthony (ciro's nephew) who has a genuine concern to keep the customers happy
manga !!
I first visited Da Ciro on a December Friday evening at the recommendation of our hotel concierge
My sister and I sat at the bar waiting for our table
We were told it would be 20 minutes
The manager was very attentive to us, and although it took longer, we felt very welcome and serviced
Our waiter, Nick was amazing
The food was fabulous
We knew we were in a great spot when we noticed people that were leaving were hugging the manager and were definitely repeat customers! I brought my husband back two nights later, and Nick remembered me
He swept us up to a romantic table upstairs and treated us like gold
He even gave us a complementary Tiramasu for dessert
(The best I have ever had)
I am planning another trip to NY in JUly, and will definitely return
I hope Nick is still there!
Another very unpleasent Fiasco in NY
service was very very slow,the Pizza wasn't as good as they say,and the manager started a fight at the Bar with a client that it turn in to a huge Drama in within 5 minutes
I am very unhappy on how this place on a thursday night,were I was aspecting delicious Pizza's and Pasta
Also, please the wine by the glass !!! $ 10 Dollar a glass for a $ 4
99 dollar bottle of wine SOLD the LOCAL liquor store next to my residence
Ridicolously hugly
Very unfare
The food was really good, but there wasn't much of it for the price they were charging
I like hearty Italian with Italian portions
=) The service was decent
they took away our bread w/o asking if we were done
the place was really overcorwded so there was no room for our dishes
The waiters were nice
the experience was just a little awkward
My first visit to Da Ciro and most certainly not my last
My brother (who had been there once recently), I were treated like family by Ciro and his manager, Tony
We sat at the bar and let Tony order for us
The Antipasto di Portobello was delicious, followed by their one of a kind focaccia with robiola cheese, prosciutto, arugula tomato
For the entree, we enjoyed spinach infused gnocchi and veal osso buco
The '02 Almanera Nero d'Avola Sicilian wine by the glass was a wonderful accompaniment
Finally, we were treated to the most heavenly Tiramisu anywhere, along with a strawberry Napoleon
Tony even ran out to our car on Lex to feed the 1 hr limit parking meter for us
We enjoyed the meal company so much we wound up being late for the Rangers game
Bravo!
This was absolutely the worst dining experience i have ever had in my life, I am still fuming from the terrible service received
My boyfriend and I were sat in the worst table in the house, right infront of the door, where everytime a patron walked in we were greeted by a cold draft
We were completely ignored the entire time there, never offered water, bread, pepper or parmesan for our food like all the other costumers
when I complained, the manager began rationalizing the bad service, when i pointed that out to him he told me if we're not happy dont come back
When we spoke to the owner, he seemed offended and escorted us out of the door as if he was throwing us out (obviously, trying to save face
) as for the food, it is mediocre at best
The service is outstanding
The food is outstanding
Have the Focaccia Pizza with the homemade mozzarella
I go to this place everytime I visit the City
i have to say this is the best restaurant i have ever been to! and i have been to so many hyped restaurants
the foccia robiola is amazing words cannot describe! i mean it!!!! the fresh pastas were a revelation
and the service is always helpful and friendly
i want to marry the place
run do not walk and have the robiala !! i am probably spelling it incorrectly
The house red wine was terrific, the service was exceptionally helpful, the food, however, was just o
k
--and especially at those prices! All in all, I find this place to be charming, but I would not say it is the greatest Italian restaurant that I have ever been to--or even close to it
oh my god! this was the best thing i ever ate
if you dine there look at the back of the menu and order the pizza that has robioli cheese and truffle oil
the food was so good
it's my new favorite italian restaurant
yummmmm
Eating at Da Ciro is never a let down
The food is always amazing
The service is great
The owner often stops by your table to make sure your meal was great is nice, but it is even better because he always means it
The pizzas are amazing!
I often pass Da Ciro's on my way home from work and I was excited to try it out
So last week 4 of my friends and I ate there
We were disappointed
We had to ask the waiter twice for a wine menu
He neglected our table and was rude
We ordered an appetizer of mussels
The mussels were not fresh, and small and mushy
The black linguine overcooked and again, very mushy
The pizza was average, the stuffed chicken was fine but they came with a side of overcooked shriveled peas
My friend ordered a pasta dish with bolognese sauce which was actually good
The only part of the meal that we truly enjoyed was dessert

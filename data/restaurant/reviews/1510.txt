On our last visit, we tried the Darna Burger, which is a fabulous lamb burger on a nice roll with homemade French fries and a salad
The sangria might be the best we've ever had anywhere
The service started out a bit shaky, but has gotten progressively better and more professional on every visit -- and the people who work there are all very nice and full of smiles
Since all our favorite Moroccan restaurants in town (e
g
Lotfi's) have now closed, we're ecstatic to have a great new favorite to take their place
Lovers of Moroccan food in New York City shouldn't miss DARNA!
what a great find! this french moraccon restaurant was the best! my friends and i were in that crazy stage where should we eat/cocktial and then we came across Darna
the place is unique and cozy with these plush chairs and beautiful decor and just great food
i loved the sangria! it was true compliment to our great meal
go-you will enjoy
There's a reason why the Magic Fountain always has a long line
They offer a wide selection of home made ice cream in a variety of flavors
You won't be disappointed!
i thought the service was fast
we went for my mom and dads wedding, well after the wedding a group of went
if you want seats, you do need to make RESERVATIONS
common sense when going to such a nice restaurant
We went to Cafe Bello hoping for a romantic night out
I called to make a reservation and was informed that they do not accept reservations for parties of two
We were told that the wait for a table would be 20 minutes; it took an hour and ten minutes
When we were seated it took 15 minutes to get a menu, half an hour for the appetizers, and an hour after the appetizers we finally received our entree
I ordered a chicken breast that was stuffed with cheese and spinach and my chicken was dry and had a strong vinegar taste
The wait staff rarely visited our table to see if we needed anything which meant we had to work to get the things we needed (menus, our main dishes, etc
)
I was terribly disappointed in the evening
too expensive for bagels
food is ok
Bagels too chewey
If this restaurant is going to charge upscale prices, they should offer upscale food, atmosphere and service
They tout being housed in a 1670 building so I expected atmosphere
Cheap tablesettings, no music with an exposed radiator made me feel as though I was in a diner
One server wore jeans and Converse hightops
Actually, waitresses double as bus boys so it was hard getting their attention
It was crowded but so is Red Lobster
The lobster bisque was like slurping a carton of heavy cream - too thick and no flavor
Clams oraganade could've come from a frozen food package! My partner enjoyed his rib-eye but mashed potatoes arrived cold
My horseradish-crusted salmon tasted delicious but arrived in a puddle of sauce which had a film on it
The accompanying scallops were not seared, just burnt brown which left an unpleasant after taste
A real disappointment for the $!
The waiters are very kind and always have a smile
It's pretty good for vegetarians or meat eaters
I would recommend the paninis
They are delicous!!!!!!!! You will be saying (or thinking) YuMmMmMmMmY!!!!!!!!! You should definitely try it sometime =)
Nice cozy bar with nice poster girl
I love this place
I made a reservation for Easter lunch here for a party of 12
When we arrived, there was no record of our reservation and although the place was empty with the exception of one small group in the back, the hostess seemed a tad flustered
The place has definitely seen better days
its a little small, very dark and everything is wooden inside adding to the dark and dreary decor
There was also an unfresh smell
We decided to leave before being seated
we didn't even tell the hostess we were leaving
I doubt she would have cared anyway
We ended up going to Legal Sea Foods in Paramus -- what a breath of fresh air from this dark, dingy, smelly dump
While I didn't eat there, nothing about the place or the staff made me want to stay and that in itself, says a lot
Everything was very overpriced for what you got - about a pound of mussels for $8
95
The caesar salad had brown lettuce in it
To top the night off, I ordered the steamed blue crabs(half dozen), and the two that I tried were very mushy (not appetizing at all
)
When I sent them back the chef accused me of eating all but one of them! Totally not worth the money
The service was fine, however
I wish I had a better reccomendation but crab houses are hard to find in this area
Small, intimate storefront room, with highly personal efficent and friendly service
Well known to denizens of Cliffside Park Vic
, but a well kept secret from Northern Bergen County
Superb northern Italian cuisine, with the best scallopini's in Northeatern US
If not on the menu, prepared to any style and sauce you request
Fish and seafood is always fresh and never overcooked
Homemade soups are a treasure from your own mother's kitchen
The Food was excellent (Greek salad, , chicken lemon-soup, Chicken Gyro, tzatziki dip, grape leaves)
The atmosphere is cute cozy for lunch/a night out with a few friends/or a date
The place was very clean the owner is present attentive to her customers
Food very very good, portion size large, chicken parm great, moist yet fully cooked
appitizer was cheese slices white nice circle and very taste slice of tomato under cheese
Don't go out weekly but do go out and enjoy a good meal
Italian is our favorite
Enjoyed meal very much
Thank You,
If you like hot dogs, hamburgers, etc
this is the place to go
Hot Grill is the best around
I highly recommend the shrimp marinara, which feature chunks of tomato in the red sauce and delicious shrimp
Plenty of sauce left for wiping down with their fresh hot bread
A must for Italian food lovers!
i'm not an italian but i enjoy italian food very much
from my experience this place is the best in NJ
especially, the red clams
i never had anything like that, ever! the only thing that's negative is u have to wait forever for ur food
btw, they opened up another location(much bigger one) on broad st
in clifton, just 5 min from the original location
Have been going to this place ever since I was a kid, when they were in Paterson
Best Dogs and Fries going period!! You have to have the DOGS ALL THE WAY!!
I've been going to chengdu for years now and have tried all the chinese restaurants in NY/NJ area
It is definitely the best
Great food, attentive service and amazing wine list
If you go, get the peking duck
Rutt's Hut is a classic hot dog joint
I have eaten many hot dogs in my day and Rutt's Hut and The Hot Grill, also located in Clifton, deliver the best dogs

One of the best places I have been for classic good food, great wine (at reasonable prices) and a great atmosphere
The lunch menu was not that expensive and certainly worth it
I've dined here a number of times over the years, and most recently last night
It remains fresh with simply flawless cuisine, service and ambience
The summer tasting menu is phenomenal, the wine pairings and suggestions terrific (and when we merely mentioned that a particular pairing wasn't great, we were promptly offered alternative wines and a repeat of the course)
Although expensive, it is head and shoulders above the rest and definitely is worth it
I know that Gramercy Tavern has gotten so many wonderful reviews, but I just returned from a restaurant week lunch and felt compelled to write another
From the warm greeting and prompt seating to the thank you as we were leaving, this place is a gem
It's clear that they value your patronage - quite a departure from the snobbish attitude exhibited at several NYC dining hotspots
The aromas divine, the service excellent and precise (thank you, Alan!), the presentation exquisite, and the food gloriously fragrant and flavorful
A true oasis
And to top things off, the manager handed us each a gift certificate towards a future lunch
Extremely classy, especially since they are one of the top restaurants in the city - it's safe to say, we will be back and soon!
We came here on the night we got engaged, and have come on the anniversary ever since
Everything here is the best, from the unbelievably attentive and friendly staff, to the food that is so delicious, it tastes like magic
Sure, there is an upper limit to how good food can be
Gramercy Tavern sets that limit
This place is awesome and awesome places in the city cost you a lot of money
Layout and dining is fine as they come in the city
Romantic place, try to sit in the back in a booth or up front if you like to watch the traffic pass by
Bar area is nice to wait at while your table is still not ready
You must make reservations here and make sure you bring the platinum card b/c dinner with drinks is around 200
Food is in small portions (frenchy style) but great
A wonderful dining experience, everything was perfect and the staff was not obtrusive nor full of themselves
The waiter knew about every item on the menu and explained it very well
They treat you with respect and also like your someone important
Its great because everyone wants to feel special when they are eating at a 5 star restaurant
The food was amazing i had the foie gras and it melted in my mouth, as a main i chose wild king salmon
The bread kept coming and the soda was refilled immediatly
The staff is watching you attentively
The desserts were outrageous, pineapple upside down cake was delicious
The absolute best part is the muffins they give you for the next day
its a great idea to remember your special nite
two 3 course prix fix plus 2 glasses of wine tax and tip $220

very reasonable for high quality dining experience
This place was wonderful
The service was some of the best
Go for the scallop appetizer and the creme brulee for desert
A little pricey, but absolutely worth it!
I've been here several times - and I really don't know why I keep going back
It is good - but certainly nothing to rave about
The menu has barely changed in four years - so go once
That will be enough
However, do take advantage of the extraordinary offering of cheeses - truly the best selection in the city (puts Artisanal to shame)
My wife and I have dined at many of the nicest restaurants in NYC and this is one of the two or three that we've wholeheartedly felt afterwards that we got our money's worth
The food was delicious
The decor upscale but not pretentious
The service excellent and with complete knowledge of the menu
Honestly, the best dining experience I've ever had
At first I was intimindated but as soon as I walked in the staff made me feel comfortable and at ease
Our waiters were polite, friendly, and eager to help
Food was absolutely amazing, highly recommend ordering the breads, lamb and lemon crepe
I left the restaurant beeming
Great for special occasions
The Grammercy Tavern has been the most consistant and joyful lunch dining experience
WHenever I am in NY is is my first choice for food, ambiance, service and all over superlative dining experience Dr

Like all restaurants that aim higher than the rest, they have further to fall
Perhaps an excess of hyperbole had raised expecatations to an unrealistic level, but I left Gramercy Tavern feeling slightly disappointed
There was certainly nothing about the environment or service to fault, both of which were virtually faultless - especially the latter
The food however, was less spectacular; several starters contained sea urchin, an acquired taste at the best of times
Mains were better, though the seasonal menu resulted in an over-emphasis on root vegetables and brussel sprouts, again a taste not shared by everyone
The lamb however, was tender and delicious
Desserts were unspectacular and the cheese-board was reasonable, albeit lacking in soft French cheeses
All in all, still one of the better haunts on the NY fine dining scene, but not the sum of its over-hyped means
Gramercy Tavern is by far my favorite restaurant in New York
The combination of food, wine, service and ambience make this spot tough to top
I love the Tavern Room with its rustic charming decor
The food is consistently great - simple yet flavorful preparations that are not overdone
The wine list is magnificent
I have frequented this establishment on many occasions and always look forward to my next return
The pecans at the bar are heavenly!
this is our favorite place to go when we're in ny
it reminds us of our favorite place in los angeles, campanile
the food is always great, the atmosphere is awesome and the service is always very professional
if you're on a budget, lunch is always a great way to experience this restaurant and not go broke
The renowed Gramercy Tavern where special moments are remembered and shared
service, in fact, does stand out in the midst of mediocre cuisine and decore, however unfortunate, service is the only facet of our dining experience that does stand out
In terms of value, best seek reservations elsewhere
In terms of cuisine, the words au buerre come to mind
My husband and I dined at Gramercy Tavern on Sept 21 for our anniversary
We both agree that the service was perfect
I have never encountered friendlier, more gracious, or less pretentious service anywhere (especially in NYC) than at Gramercy
The food was excellent, and we loved the complimentary dishes between courses as well as the yummy muffins sent home with us
I would highly recomend this restaurant to anyone
I liked the atmosphere of this place
Very classy and well decorated
However, the food was sub-par for the price
The service was wonderful
no complaints in that area
I recommend going to this restaurant once
We ate in the bar, not the formal restaurant, on August 16
The ac there was working fine
We were seated promptly, even without reservations
The service was outstanding and the entrees were excellent
We shared a peach and blueberry crisp for dessert and it was heavenly
This is a beautifully decorated restarant
The service is excellent
My wife and I were there the Saturday night after the blackout

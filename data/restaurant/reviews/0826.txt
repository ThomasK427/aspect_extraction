For two women, it was just enough food for lunch and all around quite satisfying
Ambience is chic, but in a smart way
I came here for lunch
We were seated immediately
The menu did not look particularly impressive
I had the shrimp on a skewer appetizer, which was quite good
The Cod Fish entree was less than impressive
My companion had the salmon which came only half-cooked
The menu did not specify that it would be done this way
I ordered the Jasmine blossom tea ($12)
The server put twice as much water into the pot as she should have and obviously did not steep it long enough
I essentially drank water
The decor is pleasant, but two-person tables upstairs are very small
My lunch here was not a horrible restaurant experience, but there are certainly better places for the price
Yes the crowd can get annoying and the servers don't always know what they are serving exactly, but the food has been right-on all three times I have been there
The Spanish mackarel tartar is to die for! The sauces that the chef create are so simplistic, yet amazing and compliment the super fresh fish
The sushi has always been like butter! As for the desserts, I'm a sucker for yuzu and litchies! Definitely a must for the food as long as you can deal with the fake double-kiss crowd
If you want a more quiet experience, you must eat upstairs
The sushi room is a bit loud
We were seated and HOUR AND A HALF late for our 8 o'clock reservation
In that time we were smashed into the horrifically small bar area with barely room to move, let alone sit or get a drink
People were crammed out the door
I cannot imagine what would have happened if there were a fire
When we got upstairs we were smashed into the smallest table I have ever seen next to a loud and extremely drunk group of 15
The food was subpar, although the cocktails were good
Ridiculously prized for the terrible service and awful wait however
I will NEVER go here again and I can't warn people enough not to subject themselves to this mess
This possibly the most terrible experience I had recently
We were asked change seats twice, the wine was came from a bad bottle, the food were incorrect, and servers is incompetent and rude, gave us a funny smile by saying well, what can I do, it must be your lucky day
The music is really loud! The soup is extremely salty and watery
In short with so many resaurants in NYC - this one should be overlooked
Don't waste your money
Like La Goulue, ones goes to Geisha for the relative proximity to one's place
I wouldn't go downtown for this place! The bar area is good with nice cocktails and I use it all the time to meet people for drinks
The food is great but the crowd is no longer what it used to be
All the models have moved on! It can be pricey unless you just order maki rolls:-)
From the mouth-watering sushi, to the unique decor, Geisha is a new favorite Japanese in an area that lacks many others worth mentioning
The saketinis were expertly mixed, the crab salad memorable, and the service was wonderful
We will certainly be returning often
I've been to Geisha twice and both times the food was excellent! The dining room upstairs is more quiet and intimate, the lounge when you first walk in is good for small groups of friends wanting to have drinks and some food to supplement, and the dining room in the back has anime projected on plasma tvs
The mussels appetizer and the halibut with curried spinach were both yummy, but I enjoyed the chef's plate the most (sushi and sashimi, you can pick $50, $75, $100 or more)
Extensive list of sakes and cocktails
It is a little bit pricey, but the portions are sizeable and you won't feel like you are paying to breathe the air
It's a really nice restaurant with really good food without trying too hard to be 'trendy'
There were serious problems with the kitchen and the food preparation, with dishes arriving incorrectly or undercooked (shrimp)
One of the very worst dining experiences I have had in 12 years in NY
I loved Geisha
i have no idea what the bad remarks are about
The service was lovely, the space is tres chic and the food, which is what this should be about, is delicious
The Lobster with noodles is amazing
i dream about it and being a lobster lover, find myself eating up with the noodles which make the lobster more of an unnecesary, yet delicious accesory
YUM!!! My date had the candied shrimp and they were also amazing
The mille feuille was out of this world and i would pick this place over and over again as my favorite dine out
A MUST!!!!!!!
Service was terrific
unfortunately everything else was below par
Food is boring (oysters warm, sauces gummy
the first creme brulee I couldn't finish) and wine list very generic/over priced
Room(s) cramped, ugly (and half empty)
Hostess(s)/manager rude and coarse (not even a good-bye even though we had to step between them to exit)
This possibly the most hostile environment in the biz
The waitstaff is incompetent and rude
The music is weird and really loud! The food is extremely salty and not up to snuff
In short with so many resaurants in NYC - this one should be overlooked
Don't waste your time or money
The interiors are fantastic
Both interesting and relaxing (I went for lunch)
The sushi was like warm butter
Each piece was delicate and melted in my mouth
The service was rather friendly too
It is worth another trip
The first thing my date noticed when we walked in was that that the waiters outfits, aside from being incredibly tacky, were in fact Chinese, not Japanese
That was not a good sign for what was supposed to be an upscale establishment
The evening continued with poor service, hit-and-miss food and an unbelievably pretentious crowd
Hey, we did sit beside Paula Adbul and she was getting incredible service, but I don't think even she would come back
A promised ten-minute wait stretched over an hour without apology as we were passed up for who-knows-how-many tables for two
I don't expect VIP treatment but can only stomach so much insult
They could serve the milk of paradise and I'd rather starve than give Geisha my custom
Vote with your feet and stay well away
Ive been to Geisha last night, on a busy Saturday, and I had a great experience
The service was very professional
The manager was adorable; she took great care of us
We ordered everything she suggested and everything was excellent
Everybody made sure everything was perfect, even the Chef stopped by at our table
The hard part was trying to leave Geisha
It took longer to reach the front door then to get a table
The lounge was overcrowded and everybody was pushing
But after all, it was a little price to pay for the great time we had
I gave Geisha 3 trys and 3 times they struck out
The service and the food were very inconsistent
One or the other was good on each occasion but never together! The sushi was dry, the lobster was tough, the chicken salad way too salty! I had to down a Sapporo just to wash the salt away
Maybe that's the plan? Service was clumsy weird
No finesse
Our server was pushy also
It was way too loud and HOT in the room
Bad muzak
The coat check lost my scarf too! Sorry, I won't be back
We sat at the sushi bar and let the chef select his choices for us

very fresh and delicious plate after plate - try the martini glass app- yum! ask for the one from hawaii - thats who we had and he's def thumbs up!

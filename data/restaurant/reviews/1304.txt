You couldn't help feeling ripped off with that plate in front of you
This restaruant is not long for the neighborhood
I can only imagine that the previous review was written by the owner since it's so far off the mark
Go to Stone Park and feel as though your dollar is valued and your desire for a nice meal is appreciated!
One of the best of Park Slope
The service was great!!!!!!!!! No waiting and friendly staff makes this a must trek to Brooklyn

Always ask for the food and drink specials, you can't go wrong! The location is great for dates and romantic incounters, but after 11 pm the bar gets busy with beautiful 20 and 30 somethings
We like to order in, which is completely hit or miss with this place
They rarely have a delivery guy, and he may or may not be willing to deliver--if they remember to place your order or even get the order right
But the food is quite good
I was taken to Melt by a friend for to celebrate my new job
I was impressed by the decor of the establishment
The salad I started with was flavorful
It did take a lil minute for the main course duck to arive
However once on my table the meat fell right off the bone
The cabbage was tasty and I'm not a fan of cabbage
We did wait a second for bread but it was refilled promptly
Important because it was good and I'm a fan of bread
The best part of the meal was the apple cobbler desert
Any shortcomings which were few and far in between were crossed out by this desert
And please I can't forget the music that played in tbe background was perfect for me
I'm a big house/dance music fan and it was mellow but good enough to keep my energy up
but it didn't
I often am attracted to all things modern which how i found myself in MELT
Nestled away just off 5th Ave this modern rest/bar peeks curiosity but lets down in the food dept
We shared the watermelon and Goat cheese Appetizer which didn't really excite the taste buds but neither did the 35 min wait we had for our uncooked App
We and a few other tables were randomly selected not to be served bread
I ordered a Kobe Beef Burger (med) which came out about 35-45 min later on the door-step of burnt and still bleeding on the inside
I only had water to drink which was only refilled once between when i sat down and asked for it to be refilled towards the end of my meal
I sure hope it gets better because i do like the location and ambiance
Seems all the other reviewers have reviewed only ONE restaurant
hm
Anyhow, I was eager to visit MELT considering its glass-fronted locale and uber-modern design (think brown and white - clean lines)
However, $80 later (no booze!), the two of us had encountered mediocre cooking and some odd disappointments (raw bits on the pork tenderloin - they willingly heated it further)
Maybe they'll get better with time, but the price relative to culinary ratio is
poor
I've eaten here many times and have never been disappointed
During the tastings on Tuesdays I've even been enticed into trying things I don't usually eat and they've always been BRILLIANT
It's like a Manhattan spot in Bk
except it's affordable
For dates or group functions or just a drink on the way home from work
it is my new favorite restaurant!
I watched MELT open and wondered what its impact would be
Well, its bar is beginning to attract the high-heeled Forever 21 ladies and hair-gelled men-who-love-them crowd (alas) and yet I must admit-- the food is damn good
The brunch in particular has a great menu (dime sized pancakes with nutella) and everything we ordered was very tasty-- albeit the portions were just a tad small
The decor is excellently done- some kind of Scandanavian minimalism meets LA lounge = sexy
Yes, another one-word named restaurant has hit brooklyn but at least this one knows what it's doing
OH- and they were playing Nina Simone which is an A+
My boyfriend lives up the block so we visit this place once a week
The atmosphere is very clean, mondern and low-key, the staff is very friendly, and best of all, the food is excellent! We make it a point to try something different each time we go, and so far we have absolutely zero complaints
Even the brunch and wine menu are special and well thought-out
Dishes I'd recommend are the the watermellon goat cheese appetizer, the pistachio-encrusted cod, and the melted chocolate cake
Good eating!
Melt is a little restaurant that's big on taste
The second you slide through the all glass doors, into a rich, mocha creme coloured interior
you suddenly feel transported
Melt definently affects a soulful,intimate mood
Did I mention the food? G** D**n it's tasty
I mean TASTY! You will be licking your plate
The sauces the chef cooks up are mind blowing
Tuesday nights they do a 5 course tasting for 20 bucks, which is great for a date
Overall, if you have a taste for style you should definently visit this cozy little spot
Tried this new little place on a Friday night, took a chance
Pretty cool decor, very modern for a Brooklyn I would say
Beef appetizer came with several different dipping sauces, which was a nice surprise
Pork tenderloin was really quite good
I've had a hard time finding good food in the area, so it was a welcome find
but it was good
i had the grilled fish (was it cod? i can't remember
) with fries
very tasty, light, not breaded and not greasy
i need to go back and try them for dinner
Any dish tha we had try at Sezz Medi in the pass year or so are almost perfect because the freshenes of ingredients, preparation and, most inportant, consistency! We had our relatives from the town of Caserta ( Italy) last month of may 2005 and they were very very surprise about the pizza and they said: Pasquale this pizza is better than the one that you know we had loved for so many years, this is incredible! True Story!
Sezz Medi is an excellent place to eat and hang with friends
The food is delicious and the atmosphere is delightful
I would reccomend Sezz Medi to all who are in search of a great meal and a mean Martini!!!!!
I was told by a friend that the best pizza in NYC could be found uptown at a little place call Sezz Medi
He was 10000% right
Not only is the pizza great but you definatly should try the other menu items
My favorits being the grilled octopus, tricolor salad and baby chicken
I also like that the chef has about 6 - 10 specials every day
This is worth the trip belive me
Had the chance to visit this great establishment on my recent visit to New York
The pizza was recommended by our hotel
Must say they were correct, great pizza, great service
Look forward to visiting again on my trip in a few months
If you like hanging out with the Long Island crowd and don't expect anything remotely resembling manners, then this place is perfect for you
The counter chefs are consisently rude, and understandably busy
The clientele is dull, and apparently enjoys occupying a table hours after finishing the meal, even better during the lunch rush
If you expect a pleasant host step up and help, forget it
You're lucky to get a glare
Gotta love the midtown charm
The pizza is a step up from the dough slugs often found in the USA, but it is a far cry from Europe
If you're in the mood for excellent pizza, pasta and other Italian dishes in a casual but comfortable and attractive space, this is the place to go
The owners - the Librettos - will go out of their way to make you feel like a welcomed regular even if it's your first visit
Maybe that's why so many people keep going back there

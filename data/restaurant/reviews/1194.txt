Trendy and noisy characters get preferential treatment! The management can be extremely rude and defensive
Dinner on a Friday night was nice and the crowd was just right - no wait
Food was very good but overpriced for what you got
The wine selection is great
The service, however, ruined the entire experience
I generally am not too picky about service as long as it is relatively polite and efficient, but the waiter was a complete jerk and he spilled an entire glass of water on me without so much as an apology
In fact, he acted as if he found it amusing
I will not be returning to a place that shows such disregard for its guests
Went for the third and final time last night
It's a great space but the food seriously lets the place down
Last night we waited almost an hour and a half for four different but equally overcooked dishes
Our waiter never once asked how everything was, as I suspect he knew the kitchen was producing seriously average food
Spending money on good food is one of my favourite pastimes, but for the prices here you'd expect more, and with so many great choices in the neighbourhood I won't be going back
I never ate at PC at the old Bleecker St locale and I was a regular at Nadine's, the former occupant at 99 Bank
My husband and I VERY much enjoy eating an early dinner (by 6:30) at the new Paris Commune
We now have our favorites, which we regularly order: he loves the filet mignon, I adore their steak frittes, and their bottle of Black Opal shiraz is an excellent bang for the buck
We've always enjoyed our experience here, but it may be because we come early, and usually during the week
When we've tried to get a table later in the evening, the wait is too long and the place looks to chaotic
I came with a small party had a fabulous time
The decor was sophisticated (light up picture frames) yet unpretentious
The menu ranged from standard (steak, duck and mussels-all fantastic) to curious (ostrich-awesome, and tartare-smoked not raw but still so good
) Delicious and beautiful
I've no complaints about the service, i thought it was quick for well prepared food
The waiters were homogeneous in appearance and it took a minute to differentiate which handsome, lean, dark-haired boy was ours
The only issue I had was in finding the restroom
The staircase was dimly lit, slippery and difficult to navigate in manolos
When I reached the ladiesroom, I was surprised to find a male occupant
The artsy door sign was inspecific but maybe that's just the nature of the neighborhood
All said, i had a great time and would eagerly return again
These guys should have considered a name change when they relocated from their old Bleecker St space
The new one lacks all of the warmth, charm, and character of the former
Kitchen moves at a snails pace and the servers spend most of their time blushing and aplogizing
When food finally arrives it is uninspired and mediocre at best
The manager gets high marks for attempting to smooth over glitches but the overheated room, bland bistro knock-off fare, and poorly designed bar make for a bad night
Big dissapointment
As a fan of this restaurant during the 80's and 90's I was very disapointed this time
My friend and I had brunch the coffee was cold, too much worcestershire sauce in the bloody mary
I ordered the sirlion steak and eggs my friend ordered the eggs benedict his eggs way over cooked and my steak was not a sirlion it was a SKIRT (that's false advertising)
The service was not great to say the least
I don't know if if our waiter was having a bad day but he had a look on his face as though he could be bothered
I hope they can get there act together because it used to be one of my favorite places
I was a semi-regular at the original Paris Commune on Bleecker St so I approached the new space with some trepidation
My first visit on the second night after it's opening was met with slow service due to kitchen gaffes and high noise level
My return a week later was a pleasant surprise; friendly service, a duck confit on par with Bouley, delicious cocktails, and a happy date
The manager was very warm and charming and the room is gorgeous
Glad they're working out the kinks
Re:: previous poster; you waited an hour and a half for food and leaving wasn't the best option?
Having bee a fan of the previous restaurant that occupied the site, Nadine's, I was skeptical about this new, jazzed up French eatery
However, I visited this past Wednesday for a drink at the bar
This new place was packed, which of course would account for the lousy service others have reported; the fact that it is a NEW YORK restaurant would account for the attitude
However, I found the bar waitstaff attentive and friendly, they make a mean manhattan, and the food certainly LOOKed delicious
I am planning on returning in the near future


once things calm down a bit
I reallly love this place
The menu gives options for every taste and the staff is very helpful if you have diet restictions
They play a great selection of music
I've heard everything from hard core punk, latin music, 50's 60's,even greek bellydance music
There's a waiter there that works some mornings and he always gives the best service when we go there
The old complaint I have is that one early waitress lowers her voice
There is no reason for her to scream across the room to a co- worker
Went to the Cup yesterday for lunch
Made the mistake of ordering the nicoise salad with seared tuna, and asked for it rare (the typical temp for seared tuna)
The tuna was genuinely terrifying- a bizarre consistency and color that seemed like it was literally squeezed out of a tube!! Yuck! The curly fries are great, they'll melt cheese on them if you ask, and they are tasty
Maybe my mistake for ordering restaurant fare at a diner
Don't make the same mistake!
I only come to CUP for their brunch
I always order their crab cakes eggs benedict with curly fries
It's soooo good that it's addicting
They also have other great selections such as their omelets, french toast and their fresh juices
You gotta go there just to try it, it's well worth the trip! I went a few times for dinner and their food and menu selection is just average
It's weird but their brunch menu are all delicious but disappoints on their dinner
This used to be one of my favorite places to eat in my neighborhood, good food, great prices and brunch or dinner it was great
My boyfriend and I would often sit at the bar and chat away to the friendly Irish bar man Tom
Something has happened and it is going downhill
Went in for breakfast on Saturday and it was empty where it is usually crowded, the waitress messed up thr order, the food was cold and tasteless and the whole vibe of the place was just awful
The staff were just standing around lokoing bored and it seems that the few tables around us were also unhappy with their service
What happened? Where's the old Cup I knew and loved?!
CUP has changed their menu from what it was when they originally opened, when I tried them once and didn't go back for over a year
Gone are the weirdly gourmet options, replaced with more traditional diner fare - breakfast served all day, many pages of menu items
So far I've tried 3 items on the new menu and everything is delicious! I highly recommend the chicken parmigiana focaccini, the CUP House salad, and the quesadilla
The curly fries are yummy too
A knitting group meets there in the back on Wednesday evenings, so it's great for groups
The decor has cool vintage Astoria memorabilia on the walls too
Staff is friendly, prompt, and NOT teenagers
Had some meals that were good
Some meals were very poor
Had roast beef sandwich which was cold
Once when I ate dinner at bar there were Victoria Screte magazines on the bar
Had burgers 3 times
Twice the burgers were very good, the other time it was awful-more like an uncooked meatball
Problem is staff is teenagers
Can't expect more from them
Get some professional
My wife and I went here while perusing the Museum of the Moving Image across the street, having gotten a recommendation from the staff there
Let me tell you, that was bad advice
First, the waitress messed up my grilled cheese, leaving the tomato out even though I specified it(it is on the menu that way)
Then, the waitress gave my wife coffee with regular milk in it even though my wife specifically requested Soy Milk
Granted, this isn't Starbucks, but is such a request really too hard to get right? Also, the food, the service, and the change from the bill were all quite slow considering how empty the place was

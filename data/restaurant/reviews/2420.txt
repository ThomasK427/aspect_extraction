The art is amusing as well
Arte Caf serves up some of the best deals in town and, best of all, the quality of the food is superb
The pastas are consitently good, as are the other dishes
The restaurant looks small but is actually very large
However, there are several separate dining areas, so the atmosphere is very nice and diners don't feel overcrowded
The best local Italian restaurant (in an area filled with them) by a long shot
This is a safe bet for not only your grandma, but your date, parents or young children getting a taste of fine dining
It is unpretentious, warm and relaxed, great location, friendly service and unbeatable prices
I almost can't believe how well-priced this restaurant is given the quality of food and the ambiance
Room is lively and elegant, and the food is really very good
My wife and I eat here once a month - feels like something of a special occasion place, but priced like it's a neighborhood restaurant
Pastas are delicious and great selection of classic Mediterranean fish dishes
My boyfriend and I go every weekend for brunch
They offer the city's best bacon and very reasonable mimosa breakfast! It is a great value!
The Scene This African-inspired jazz club, owned by former pop duo Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, is known for drop-ins from the likes of Patti LaBelle and Maya Angelou
In addition to excellent live jazz, R    on weekends, it switches over to South American
Weekdays' jerk chicken wings set your mouth ablaze, and the grilled pork chop, accompanied by Eggo-like waffles, comes covered with unexpectedly fiery apples
Ginger creme brulee is spiced just right, but banana bread pudding is dry
For a weekend snack, scoop up guasaca--an avocado-lite version of guac--with tasty cornmeal doughnuts
The food was excellent (except the fried shrimp appetizer - it was overcooked)
The atmosphere was nice in the front room, but despite a reservation, we were relegated to the rear, where we were treated like stepchildren - we had to flag someone down to take our order, water with no ice, we had to ask for extras (as opposed to someone asking if we needed something else)
And, after all that, the 18% gratuity was added to our bill because we had a table of four
We refused to pay it
Sad that the service was so poor, because it really is a decent spot
On the whole a fairly good experience
Everyone's entree was good and the music was very well done
A good feel to the place was definitely in effect
The only negative that I can relate is that the appitizers were a bit over priced for what you get
So, perhaps not exceptional food for NYC, but certainly exceptional food when compared to other mixed venues (dinner menu live music) you're likely to find
Taken as a whole we strongly recommend this place
Best to call ahead for reservations because it does get crowded
My Husband I went to the Sugar Bar on our Anniversary
We were seated promptly by a lovely polite Hostess
The cozy ambiance is extremely beautiful
It felt like vacation in an exotic paradise
The service was great, our waitress was professional informative
Appetizers we had the Shrimp in garlic white wine sauce, catfishstrips and an avocado salad awesome
Our entrees I had Mesquite BBQ Chicken w/Mac--Cheese Collard Excellent
My husband had the MotherLand Grilled Colossal Shrimp w/Rice Beans garlic spinach Spicilicous
Lastly dessert Bread pudding, to die for, with vanilla ice cream, after one bite, my husband ordered his own
Happy Anniversary! The Live Music was terrific, people were jumping out of their seats, singing-along
I would highly recommend the Decor is spectacular, Ambiance is Fabulous, Food is Great Wonderful service
An extraordinary place to enjoy Great Food Music for one price!
This place surprised me
As soon as you walk in, the decor transports you! The place is a little tight, but wonderfully decorated
Ashford Simpson have created the best celebrity owned restaurant, I have been too
The service was very good, but best of all, the food was delicious
Everyone in our party of 8 enjoyed everything ( and I mean EVERYTHING) on their plates
We were very quiet for a while
The drinks were good too
We went on a Friday and the live entertainment was decent
Who cares though because the atmosphere, service, food and energy of the place was great
This was my 3rd trip to NYC and any future visits will definitely include Sugar Bar!
Saturday night we were transported to a world we never knew existed on the UWS
It was like walking into an Afro-Carribean village (check out the bathroom!) with leather and/or straw adorning everything
The music was Garifuno, Honduran/Belizian tribal played by an enthusiastic band with amazing hip-gyrating dancers
The energy permeated the room
Throughout the evening guests were encouraged to get up and swing what your Mama gave you
Even the staff couldn't help getting down briefly on their way to and from the kitchen
Quarters were tight, but the atmosphere was so fun that no one cared
Although we came late, we were squeezed into the main dining area so we could watch the entertainment
The waiters were speedy
The Guasacaca and the Bisteak were delicious! This place was a gem -- who knew there was such an exotic, fun place for dinner and music on the UWS?
This is far worse than any other Baluchi's in NYC
The ceilings are very low thanks to a make-shift second story , the space is incredibly cramped and loud and the food and the service are atrocious
If you enjoy dining elbow to elbow with equally unsatisfied strangers while eating cold gristle masked with indian seasonings and listening to cooks screaming in the wide-open kitchen (which was about 6 inches from our table), this is the place for you
Oh, and if getting half a bottle of wine spilled on you by the waitress (with no apology or even acknowledgment of her faux paus) sounds fun, then have a blast at Baluchi's
This was probably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my 12 years in NYC!
If you like rubbing elbows with New York's elite, this is not the place for you
If you like rubbing elbows with perfect strangers, I mean literally rubbing elbows, well this is it
The service also is quite vacuous--it sucks
Rude, loud, and nothing to write home about
Been to some $$$$ indian places and some $ places
never have I been charged SEPARATELY and expensively ($5+) for some rice and peas
One of the waitresses (whom I think is also the owner) was literally barking at these women next to me what they should eat
and I mean with attitude
We had bread, stew, and rice for $40! I didn't leave a tip
they chased me out into the street to confront me with their righteous indignation
THIS PLACE SUX
I ordered from these guys - the delivery guy complained about the size of the tip - I called the manager to claim - she hung up on me! I called back to say that she hung up - he said the manager would take care of it - I asked if they had only one delivery guy, or how would they know which one to talk to? He hung up
The food is OK, just your standard Indian-food-made-for-Americans
But the service is pathetic! I've ordered from here twice before, each time they messed up something -- the order was wrong or late
One time the guy demanded more tip and wouldn't leave until I gave it to him! But I tried a 3rd time (3 strikes and you're out)
Mostly because I felt like Indian food fast
The guy put me on hold forever, but this time the order arrives in 20min -- pretty good -- and the guy had change
I opened the bag, only to find out it's someone else's order! I called -- he says he will send over the correct order right away
45 min later he shows, demanding the old order, as if they will serve this to someone else!? I call to complain, he only cares if I paid the $$$ or not
We ordered navrattan curry (a vegetable dish) last night and after calling to ask for a replacement (the dish was disgusting), the manager refused to compensate us in any way
He even went so far as to yell at us regarding low quality of the food
We found it frustating that although he admitted the dish was bad and for kids, not ordered by adults but refused to let us exchaNGe
Conclusion: DON'T EVER ORDER FROM OR DINE AT THIS RESTAURANT
p
s
for the low quality of this food, it was extremely over-priced
Our evening at Epices was a step into North Africa--a visit to Tunisia
Food was super
The lamb dishes were wonderful and the vegetables super
Go there!!
Though the seating in here is a tad cramped, the service was excellent and the food was well-worth the visit
The lamb tagine is superb

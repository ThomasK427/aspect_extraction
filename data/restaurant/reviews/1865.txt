Honestly, I wouldn't go back here unless I was not paying or was forced to
To sum it up, BAD!!!!!
Woo Lae Oak is definitely not what you would expect at a Korean restaurant
Very modern and sleek looking
Probably a good place to bring a date or some colleagues, anyone you might want to impress with some eye candy
However, the food at Woo Lae Oak does not taste Korean
It tastes far from being real, Korean food
The modern twist on most of the dishes suits the modern design of the place, but if youre looking for some good, juicy, traditional, Korean food, this is not the place to go
I doubt anyone whos grown up on Korean food will really like the food here
Like most trends, Woo Lae Oak is for the pretentious
This place is yummy good! Although this is definitely not what you call traditinal Korean food, Woo Lae Oak offers delicious marinated meats that you can grill at your own table
They also have a good selection of entrees from the kitchen and a full bar
The ostrich is tender and tasty and worth a try
The place is pricey, but it's SoHo and not many other places offer what Woo Lae Oak does
Pricey, but worth every penny! Woo Lae Oak is not what one would expect from a Korean restaurant
It's modern yet has Asian touches with its clean-lined decor
House/techno beats in the background
Each table has its own (rather small) 'smokeless' grill
Service was quite good too
Theres a full bar and a nice wine list
Our appetizer was HUGE - large enough for 3 people to share
The BBQ portions are also fairly large and we were unable to finish the two plates wed ordered
Each plate comes with rice, a spicy salad, and four little pickled dishes including wonderful kimchi
Dessert was not fabulous, but it wasnt bad either and gave a nice ending to what was a fabulous meal
A great place to dine out for small groups (3-4 people) although they do cater to large groups as well
I have gone here on several occasions when I have many different tastes to cater to
Someone can always find something they like
The cocktails are very good
The waiters do push a lot of food, so I would not order as much as they say, but overall I always have a very good dining experience here
Cool bathrooms too
Went to Woo Lae Oak with a group of friends-- food was decent for Korean BBQ, but priced on the high side
The service was good, the hostess accomodating (she held our table for us nearly an hour despite our running late!)
Cool, minimalistic decor and techno music matches the trendy crowd and atmosphere
We went there on one of those rainy weekdays
The place is not crowded at all, and almost half the tables there are birthday bunch
Service is extremely fast and friendly
It's a great place for group gathering, and a bit noisy if you don't mind
Food is pretty good, like most Korean BBQ, plus a few good innovative appetizers
I suggest people go for Price-fix menu, otherwise the bill can really add up pretty quickly
My friend and had dinner here on Saturday and I cannot say one bad thing about it
We had a great table, fun waiter and the food was excellent
I especialyy liked the cold saki sampler
There was also a pretty cool scene
Good Frozen Drinks, I have been there weekdays and weekends - day and night
Now the weekend summer nights are more crowded but hey we still always get sited within 10 minutes
For the food is good I mean I not coming here for dinner ok just to hang out eat a little and drink some frozen drinks with my wife and friends
I have been coming here for about 2 years
For large groups I came one time with about 6 people one Saturday, maybe we got lucky for that one
We got seated in about 15 minutes for that one
Just don't come with a group of 6 or 10 everytime and think to get seated right away
I went there with 6 of my friends on Sunday, July 3rd around 11 P
M
Our waitress didnt show up till after at least 30 minutes
When the food came and we were eating, 1 of my friend asked for more water
He approached the wrong waitress, instead of the one serving us
The waitress was wearing a yellow t-shirt that day
I wish I got her name! She responded my friend with very bad attitude
She said: get your own waitress okay!!! We all opened our mouth with surprises
She didnt have to respond that way
After that I don't even want to eat anymore
Their service disgusted me! We got our check and left
We STILL paid that 18% gratuity though
I would never ever go back there again even it is a free dinner
I strongly NOT recommend this place
if you like
- cold food - dirty menu's (really
it was sticky and oily) - unknowledgeable waitress (she didn't know what anything was) - 20min waits for the server to come with water (after you have to request it
) - and another 20min to come take your drink and order - AND
WHEN YOU REQUEST FOR WATER FROM ANOTHER WAITRESS HER REPLY TO YOU WAS, ** WITH ATTITUDE **, ASK YOUR OWN WAITRESS!!
I have been to panchitos several times at different times of the year with many different waitresses
I have found that the bigger the group, the better the service
When I go with a couple of people, I have a hard time getting noticed
But when I go w/ 15 or more, we get excellent service
The food is NOT what we go for! It's one of the only CHEAP places that all our friends can go without having to feel like they can only get water and a salad
They can eat and get a drink for $15-$20 (including tip)
If you like Margaritas, they are slightly above average and come at 20 oz
(pitcher is fun for one who doesn't want to keep ordering
not good for group, goes too fast)
If you have friends from diverse financial backgrounds
this is a great place for everyone to feel comfortable
I was at Panchitos last week and had a great time
We had the cutest and friendliest waitess named Kelly
She was very busy, but still found time to give us great service
I have read comments about bad service, but we had great service
The food was very good
This restaurant is far by THE WORST I've been to in my entire life
Everything was just absolutely horrible
The service, food, atmosphere, people, drinks, music, bathrooms
I can go on forever
We waited for 1 hour each time the waitress came over to our table
1 hour for water, 1 hour for drinks, 1 hour for food, as you can see we were there for almost 5 hours before our bill came, not for enjoyment but pure frustration
We could of easily walked out through the back door since we were thrown in some secluded back corner near the door
However when we went to pay for the bill, we had to hunt her down just to pay it
The waitress had the nerve to hold our change and claim it better be her tip!! Well we got our change and gladly departed leaving her nothing
Twice I've been forced to go to this place in a group because of the ideal setup for a group with couches clustered around coffee tables
The first time the waitress was so forgetful and rude that I got her name and vowed I would give the place a terrible review
The margaritas were good, but buying a pitcher was just as expensive as buying seperately
Food was mediocre tex-mex that I would have pay $6 for, but not $12
The second time was Cinco de Mayo
We were okay with waiting the 45 minutes for a table, but we sat at the table for 45 minutes without anyone even greeting us or bringing menus! Don't go here

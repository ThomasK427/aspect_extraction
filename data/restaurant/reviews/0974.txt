Really chocolaty and melts in your mouth
The end of dinner truffles that came with the meal were a nice touch
Cons: the seared fish was ok, but not very exciting
I wish the bread was warm
I heard many good reviews and so I made a reservation 1 week before and invited some friends along
Although we arrived on time, we were told to sit and wait while some customers were paying their check
20 minutes later, some guys in suits showed up, made a fuss because their table wasn't ready, and so they got seated immediately! We then tried to reason with the staff politely, but were told that there was nothing they could do and they made us wait for another 20 mins! There was no apology nor explanation, just plain rude stares! Although the food was good, we all agreed that we will never return again
I have been countless of restaurants in the city but was never treated with such bad manners
Although it's hip at the moment, but with such bad service, I doubt it will be hip for too long!
I was there at the beginning when they first opened, and just there recently, and found the combination of food flavors still pushing the upper limits of experimental ecstacy -- this time with the rich and creamy silkiness of their foie gras and avocado salad
This recommended by a well informed and attentive server who went on to offer other inventive suggestions in which to round out my meal
Listen closely
Let the servers be your guide with this one! If your attention span is short, there's always a lot to look at an interesting, mixed crowd that reminds us we're in NYC
sleek japanese-inspired space, with an added warmth and touch of creativity
our dinner was marred by painfully slow service
nevertheless, the food was harmonious, balancing the refined and subtle japanese palate with various worldly influences
the elements in the cocktails were more balanced my on my second visit, but delicious and still pricey at $9-12
riingo offers premium and unique sashimi and sushi selections
the famous mousse-stuffed shitake tempura mushrooms were juicy puffy buttons of delight
our fish entrees (the semi-delicate seared char with coconut milk and the heartier poached bass with mushrooms and tasty, tender octopus) were perfectly cooked and presented
the green tea doughnuts, cinnamon sauce, and green tea kulfi that comprised one dessert each offered a developed, distinct taste
but together, they made for a knockout finale to dinner
overall enjoyable, recommended experience despite the sluggish pace of the kitchen
very disappointed
the waiters are poorly trained, food is only mediocre, and the restaurant was so small and uncomfortable
not worth it for the price
The food was excellent but the service was terrible!! They made a mistake with our reservation and made us wait for 40mins, and no apologies
Even if the food is okay, I'll never go back because of its service
Riingo was crowded and disorganized
Service was very poor and waitstaff uninformed
Japanese cuisine was below average while the community table was noisy and uncomfortable
Maybe Riingo will settle down in the future
I went here twice-first time was excellent and second time was just ok
I ordered the same dishes but the quality has gone down signigicantly-it's such a shame!! It was sooo good before, what happened? This man who welcomed us laughed at me when I asked him on the way out if the chef changed, saying I'm not a professional food critic-I'm not but I know when my favorite dishes taste different!! So I left the place being offended
I had the poached bass and it was just way too salty
Everything else was nice
Our waitress was helpful with making the choices and she did a really good job
What I didn't understand was why this waitress seemed to be afraid of other waiters-very strange
I loved the restaurant
If you go, you have to order the beef ribs for appetizer, coconut char for entree and green donuts for dessert
I thought the price was reasonable and I'll defintely be going back!
Ultra-chic decor, superb cocktails, inventive sushi
Highly recommend the green tea donut
On pricey side and making reservations can be difficult, but well worth it
Fantastic dining experience and also great for cocktails
Marcus is on the line placing passion to plate (thankfully not playing celebra-chef), but his stab at an American-Japanese menu was falls short of his potential
If not for a competant a la carte selection (foie-gras at $8, but served with wasabi?!?), one would hardly distinguish this offering from other ASIAN-Fusion restaurants
Plating was the most exciting part - you'll see when you get there
Meat dishes were far better flavored than the fish (all five I tasted were flat)
Pluses: the sumptuous Nori-wrapped Foie-gras candied watermelon at $17, the signature apple (riingo) pomegranate cocktail was great, so was the kumquat sour
Avoid the baked char entree (served on top of a sour-dough-like bread) and monk-fish liver with char ceviche app
- a senseless way to eat a perfectly tasty char
A '99 Muscat desert wine was fantastic but at $18 a glass make it count
I am a big fan of Marcus, and I was really hoping for something special
First of all, the lights were too bright, and the music was too soft
The service was new, so I won't hold them to too high a standard
The menu was not nearly as daring as I had hoped, and the food was overall just ok
The sushi was plain lousy though
I hope in time that Marcus will turn this around
This place definitely has the just-opened-so-we-have-to-try-it crowds, but luckily, the crowds are warranted
The food is amazing
I went there with a friend a few nights after it opened and we were pleased with both the quality of the food and the quality of the service
The sushi is all great, but the real winner is the braised pork belly with honey glazed garlic
Oh, and if you want a drink that's a lot less-than-ordinary but better than anything you've had lately, make sure you try the Kumquat Sour
The Green Tea Donuts were also pretty unique and very good
The Scene With teak pagodas, low golden lighting and a dramatic staircase carved into the center of the room leading down to the equally stylish bar, Jean-Georges Vongerichten has redefined exotic dining
The crowd--a sexy, well-appointed mix of downtowners, moneyed execs and occasional celebrity--is worthy of a wandering eye
Expert servers pad through the various dining areas with ease and grace
The Food It's billed as "Asian street food," but since the menu is a creative collaboration between expert chefs Vongerichten and Gray Kunz, dishes show unmistakable finesse
Shaved tuna and small tapioca balls--a playful substitute for roe--float in an addictive, tart-smooth pool of coconut water and kaffir lime juice
Remarkably tender short ribs are served with a sweet-spicy topping of chilies and onion
Even the green curry is nicely balanced and lush
For dessert, choose the ephemeral-yet-potent Vietnamese coffee tart partnered with condensed milk ice cream
I have been to Spice Market about 5 times and each time seems to get better
The service problems mentioned in other reviews we have never experienced
In fact the service has always been warm, friendly and informative
Even the managers checked in on us on our last visit
And the food continues to bring us back again and again
I crave the Samosas and Cod
The ginger fried rice is off the charts and the Ovaltine dessert is devine
Really fantastic dishes
The decor will take you away
You don't even feel you're in New York
Very imaginative and exotic
I would highly recommend this place to anyone
At least go and make your own decision
The place, food and service are top notch
I only wish it were a little easier to get a prime time reservation
Definitely call ahead if you want a prime time table, but we've walked in and scored a table on what seemed to be a busy night
Either way you'll be in for a delightful experience
This restaurant does not dissapoint--if you are under the age of 40
But for some of the more mature diners out there, Spice Market is just another lavishly decorated restaurant with food that does not match the quality of the surroundings
Their signature dessert, however, is not to be missed
Great location
Cool decor
The food? Not good to average at best, but nothing to rave about
Service started off on the right note, but as the night progressed, service was even more disappointing than the food
I would not go back
I went to the Spice Market last weekend because of all this hype about it, plus because it's a couple of my friends' favorite
So, I went there with my girfriend

When we complained we were given an apology and two sodas on the house, not an offer for dessert, or a round of drinks, or anything else
This is despite the fact that our meager portion of dinner had cost over $100
IT WAS AWFUL!
There is nothing special about the place, as the food, service and atmosphere are all mediocre
Add this to the overpricing of everything, and its easy to keep on walking
There are too many other good sushi places in the city and within distance of Sushiann, like Naniwa for example which is much more authentic
went here for a corporate lunch; good place, good selection, authentic without a doubt
very overpriced and very droll
dont take clients or a girlfriend here if you want to make a 'bangup' impression
but i guess (with the exception of sushi samba at night), most sushi places tend to lack 'atmosphere'
The Scene This outpost of the Heartland Brewery chain is nestled right across from the East River at South Street Seaport
The crowd is a mix of tourists traveling to and from the scenic destination and casual imbibers looking to spend the afternoon nursing any of the brewery's signature beers
Affable bartenders preside over the rich mahogany bar
The Food With a nod to its surroundings, the upscale pub menu is strong on seafood
Square mini-burgers and chicken tenders are popular starters
A pulled pork sandwich is tender and overflowing with meat and barbecue ribs are piled high over creamy mashed potatoes
Fried cod and fish-and-chips take care of the high-cholesterol set
Lighter options such as a sesame chicken salad and vegetarian chili are less flavorful than the higher-calorie menu items
We chose Heartland Brewery as the location for an office birthday lunch due to the reputation of the other Heartland Brewery restaurants we have been to
Unfortunately, this location at South Street didn't live up to the standard
Our waitress was obviously too busy to wait on all of her tables
My party of six was the last to get our orders taken after she decided to tend to other patrons who arrived after us
It was a complete disappointment and I will not have anymore group lunches at Heartland Brewery
I honestly believe it was going to be great food and great service but that wasn't the case at all!
This place was built for tourists so it is too bad they don't offer any happy hour specials
but it is worth the trip anyway
The option of sitting outside and people-watching is definitely a plus in the summer months
The seaport usually has a band playing during the week and that is within earshot
another plus
The bar munchies are definitely above par and the assortment of seasonal beers is a must try for any New Yorker
My favorite is the Pumpkin Ale offered in the Fall but the Apricot Summer Ale is great, also
Great place - Dark Wood - a lot of the original detail
It has a wonderful atmosphere and the beer and food are way above par
I love the fish and chips
Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5
99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!  The food is consistently wonderful - I've been coming here for years, and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly
I love this place!   A hearty two thumbs up!
I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it
Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early
After reading bad reviews, I thought: How could service be rude for a buffet? To my surprise, the owner is breathing down your neck even when the restaurant isn't full
I'll go back to this neighborhood for Indian but I'll go a few doors down to the restaurant on the corner
We went for a buffet as a group of four on a weekday
Food was very good
When we were winding down, the owner comes up to us and says, if you are done, can you leave, as there are people waiting
I was surprised but said ok, give us a few minutes
He came back in 2 minutes and reiterated the request
We left in a hurry
On the way out, I told him that what he did was rude and uncalled for
I told him that this what one would expect at a cafeteria and not a restaurant
His response - my prices are lower than cafeteria prices
I was shocked
As I said before, if you can put up with such service, go there
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood
It is terrific, as is the value
$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled
I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great
Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison
Go hungry and enjoy
the food was wonderful
sometimes the vegetarian restaurants compensate with a lot of oil to make the food rich and tasty
not chennai garden
the vadai rasam was delicious and spicy
so was the masala dosa
the service was fine; in fact our food came out very quickly
granted it was a sunday night but the place was pretty full
We saw a article about this place in NY Times so, we wanted to try
We ordered appetizer , Alu Chana Alu Gobi for two of us, Then we had to wait 45mnts(very noisey, packed, and only 2/3 waiters to serve) finally we got then main dish without serving spoons
And guess what, food serving guy served our appetizer to somebocy else
We never got our appetizer So we had to cancel it
It was a very bad service
Its not worth! Even Food is not great
I wouldn't recomend this place
Extremely crowded and noisy at lunch
The $5
95 all-you-can-eat lunch is tooted as a good deal but a the ambiance is dreadful and you can get a terrific meal, also kosher vegetarian, in peace with service just around the corner for $2 more
Mediocre food, small selection, couldn't wait to get out the here
Disappointing food, lousy service
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area
I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it
I noted it was crossed off on the bill
The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14
95
Note that they do not serve beer, you must bring your own
The combo dinners offer a variety of different dishes that give an opportunity to taste many different menu items at once
It's slightly pricy to do the combo dinner vs ordering one entree
But, the food was delicious and includes a small dessert dish
The staff was very friendly, especially compared to other restaurants in the area such as Pongal
The mango lassi is a must try
I had passed by this cute Southern Indian vegetarian joint a couple times and made it a point to check it out
I'm a big carnivore, and normally, a meal is not complete without some meat dish, so my apprehension to eat here was obvious
The dishes were so incredible, though, that I altogether forgot about meat and for a second considered becoming a vegetarian! The prices are unbeatable and quite frankly, the food is great for whatever you're paying for it
The owner is also quite welcoming and pleasant, with a hope for the restaurant that I would like to see come to fruition
I was seated quickly and a waiter showed up promptly to take my drink order
I was a single guest and I found the ambiance pleasing
I took a seat not too far from the small bar so I could see but not hear the TV
The food was good; I had Penne Chicken and Sausage with Broccoli

genius to me! Not a happening spot though, we were the youngest there (in our 30's)
So if you're looking for a quiet cozy romantic meal, go to Willow!
My husband and I had dinner at Willow yesterday
We've walked by the restaurant so many times as it's in our neighborhood, but never had a chance to check out the place until last night
It was such a cute and adorable place with a bar on the first floor and a cozy second-floor dining room
It also offers an outdoor (sidewalk) dining option during warm season
Food was quite enjoyable and satifactory, although it may not satify the true gourmet/gourmand in this city
(Not that it matters to me :) ) I can see someone's complaint below about the service, but all staff members we met yesterday were very polite and professional
Overall I think it's a great place to have a nice, quiet and even romantic dinner with someone you can share a good conversation with
WILLOW - A WONDERFUL FIND Such a cute and warm place
We went for lunch and the service couldn't have been better
Our waiter was attentive and very friendly
Food was very good - vegetable rolls, mussels and the steak sandwich were all good
Very relaxing and cozy
Very atypical of the usually stuffy upper east side restaurants
We will go back again
Didn't enjoy it at all
Food was lousy
Help didn't speak english
My husband and I arrived late one night with no reservation, unaware that such a lovely place existed in our neighborhood
We were treated so well and the food and atmosphere was wonderful
We lingered all night and will definitely return!
Attentive, warm friendly service
Beautiful view at corner tables overlooking Lex
73 St
I just came back from a 2 months vacation in Italy, and my experience at this cute intimate restaurant was without a doubt a PLUS
The pastas and the pizzas took me back to Italy, while the service was very frendly and professional
and finaly you can find some Italian people serving; making your experience more authentic
bravo!
Absolutely fabulous service at this tasteful italian restaurant
Upstairs was very elegant
I had the filet mignon, shrimp and chicken special
Hit the spot
The riccotta cheeescake wasnt the best but we had a grerat evening
They even comped us a free wine glass and port wine
Definately would go back
Rudest employees and most disrespectfull management I've ever had the bad luck of ordering from
Don't these clowns know they are in a customercentric business??? Messed up my order and basically said to go pound sand
What I wound up eating was mediocre at best
I would avoid like the plague
Eaten there twice, one chicken entree came with unexpected prosciutto on top and covered in thick gravy, I was hoping for lite chicken pasta entree
Daughter wouldn't finish chicken parmigan
If you're new to Afghan cuisine, think Indian -- many of the dishes have similar roots, but in Afghan hands take on a different twist
The food here was very good, the selection broad, but he best reason to come is the warm ambiance and the friendly and efficient staff
Reasonable prices
I had dinner here for the first time on Saturday night
We had table for 4
From the moment we walked in, the gentleman who took our coats was so warm
The entire staff gave us welcoming smiles and we were seated right away
The sambosas were nice
Our entrees were of great quality meat
The brown rice is very good too
Menu has so many things
We had afghan tea after dinner
Excellent service and I hear they deliver too
My experiences with service were always prompt, and pleasant
The food is reasonably priced, and of solid, though not exceptional, quality
Their happy hour specials from 5-6:30pm during the week, and Monday salmon and Weds
tuna specials are amazing deals
My wife and I dined for the first time at Hunters on February 18, 2006 and found the restaurant to be an excellent find
We were seated promptly without a reservation
Our server could not have been nicer or more competent
The menu is varied and generally very modestly priced, as is the wine list
We enjoyed a Napa Ridge Merlot, a bargain for $26
00
The menu ranges from items like meatloaf and chopped steak ( which I had and loved) for $10 or $11 to a $22
95 lobster special and slightly more expensive rack of lamb
I noted that lots of older people eat here, because the quality is good, prices are reasonable, and the staff is cordial
What can be better than that combination? The ambiance is ok with a fireplace in the front
If I lived on the Upper East Side, I'd eat here all the time
It is so nice to go to dinner at a place that has great food, no attitude, and consistently good service
Don't miss Tong, the chef, who is there 24/7 and always says hello to guests
It doesn't have the glam, but has substance
A great neighborhood place
I love hunters
The food is always fresh tasty and not very pricey
Try the lamb, best in the city
Every fish on the menu is delicious too!  The decor might need a little facelift but it's always cosy
The service is great if you're fair with them at the end (they do have a lot of older non tipping clientel) and the bar is a great place to get a beer without the headaches of some of the other places in the area
Try it once, you'll go back!
The best neighborhood restaurant
The food is fresh, delicious and a wide variety for a classic continental restaurant
Can you say dumplings! The staff is attentive and chef tong with prepare your meal the way you request
The clientel is a bit old and demanding but the fireplace in the winter can't be beat
The prices are great making it the best value in the city with large portions of scrumptious fare
There is an occasional celebrity sighting as well, (I guess they know a good value when they see one)
I absolutely love this place as the food is superb and the service is excellent
The chef is there 7 days a week ensuring excellence for every meal had there! They welcome large parties at extremely reasonable prices with a great selection of food
This place is definitely one that everyone should put on their must try list!! Corned beef hash during brunch is a MUST
It is the best I ever had!
A quiet place, done up similar to a hunter's lodge, a faux fireplace, etc
Always cool inside, but the service is always attentive and friendly and the food, yes
This is always good
Good, the way eating out in a place that cares to serve good food is good
For example, the corned beef hash is made fresh and wow is that good when made right
I've only been there for brunch, which can get a little crowded on Sunday, but it's worth any wait at the bar Why bother at Buhby's or Isabella's - Hunters is just as good and just around the corner
Well we started the night off with the idea of having a couple beers and some burgers at DC's
Since when we walked by they had a sign advertising a 4th of July party with $3 beers
So we go in and seat our selfs and order two beers, some patato skins and two burgers
We get our beers and then are told from a confuzed waitress that she realized that she can't give us the happy hour drink prices if we are not sitting at the bar

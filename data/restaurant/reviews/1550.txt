The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning
It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC
My friends and I ordered several different things, and all the food was a huge disappointment: the corned beef and pastrami were tough and rubbery and way too salty; the turkey, we saw only later, came out of a bag -- never a good sign; and the tongue was disgustingly gelatinous
To boot, the service was surly, and the prices were extremely high
If I'm going to pay $13 bucks for a sandwich, I expect it to be first-rate, and this stuff didn't come close
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone
As a native New Yorker, I've been going to delis, including Katz's, my whole life, so I know a thing or two about good corned beef and pastrami
Sadly, Katz's no longer offers it
This place has declined precipitously over the past ten years
I return there every few months, hoping things have picked up, but they haven't -- they've only gotten worse -- and now I've reached the end of my patience
My latest (and last) experience at Katz's was the other night
The corned beef was greasy and tough as shoe leather
The pastrami tasted like a tire
Yearning for a glimpse of the place's glory days, I tried hard to enjoy myself
But the food was terrible -- and expensive!! My friend and I spent about $50 for a couple of sandwiches, a hot dog, and two beers
A huge rip-off
We have eaten at Jewish Deli's of equal or better quality
However, if in the area, then by all means go to Katz's--but be selective of what you order
The pastrami sandwich was outstanding!! The corned beef Rueben was terrible --the meat was dry and the sandwich was greasy
We could not order the tongue, because they were out of it
Two members of our party ordered the chicken matzoh ball soup and half a pastrami sandwich
The matzoh ball was the size of a golf ball and pronouned outstanding--a floater-not a sinker! French Fries, Cole Slaw and pickles were all good
The slices of bread were too small and too thin to cover the sandwiches
The Harry Met Sally sign was not there
Overall--overated!
My husband and I came to New York for a great deli experience
We were told to go to 2nd avenue deli, which we did, and it was good, but not a patch on Katz's
The atmosphere, food and service were quintessentially 'New York'
The matzoh ball soup is the best i've ever eaten and this includes homemade recipes from my jewish relatives
A big, big thumbs up!!
The service was excellent
The only thing is the food was just awful
It was the first time I ever had a knish - what is everyone raving about? Its basically a bland potato hot pocket fried in oil
Even salting it didn't help at all
I must have used 1/2 the salt in the shaker and the oil just neutralized it so that you couldn't taste it at all
It was sooo hopelessly bland so I couldn't finish it
Hot dogs - I took one bite and couldn't swallow it
It was pure grease! I was only able to eat the saurkraut on top of it
terrible pastrami and corned beef
Meat was old and tasted funny, was stringy
There was just really nothing for a picky eater to eat here
If you consider yourself a savory person, this is not the place for you
I have been going to Katz's for over 40 years now
My father first took me when i was around fuve or so
Used to go befor going to Met or Yankee games
and of course always got a sandwich for the game
The taste hasn't changed in all that time either
I now live in Arizona and still find my way back to The city
even for Katz's only
Please don't ever change
for those who don't like the food
good
more for me and my family
NOw my Kids always ask
daddy?
when are we going to go to Katz's again
that says it all
Thanks Dad
The food is wonderful it is the best deli
They need one in the Rockville, Maryland area
They do not know what a great deli is
They cannot compete to the food up in New York City
Love the triple decker sandwiches -corn beef/tongue/pastrami
Having Katz's Deli listed as a must-try in NY really got my interest piqued
I was expecting too much hype over a so-so foodfare
I was surprised!!! I had the time of my life eating my first pastrami sandwich
it was DEeelicious! I would definitely visit again and bring friends from the Philippines over, hopefully to try the famous corned beef and salami next time
Some comments though- my split pea soup was too thick it looked and tasted almost like mud, and i felt the practice of shoving bill stubs onto customer's hands without an explanation didn't jive with the historic feel and look of the place
It was too commercial
Just a classic New York Deli - from the food to the folks that work there! While not 100% consistent, it is the best pastrami in New York!
simply the best
don't even think about ordering anything but the pastrami sandwich
do NOT sit in the waiter service area
DO elbow your way up to the counter and enjoy the whole katz experience; make sure to tip your counterman
do NOT wear your good shirt
the sandwich is capable of making homer feel stuffed
Incredible corned beef
Always make sure you order at the counter (don't use table service) and give the counterman a few dollars for a tip and ask for the best quality corned beef
You will not be disappointed with the juicy, crisp outside, tangy meat
They will give you a sample while slicing the meat, and the sandwiches are big enough to easily share (no charge either!)
The turkey's great too and the steak fries are about as good as frozen steak fries can get
It can get crowded on the weekends, but bring your appetite and $1 bills and you will leave happily satiated
Food great! Staff great
Physical ambience OK
but who can argue with the hustle and bustle and the true NYC, Lower East Side atmosphere? Pastrami superb
Love the matzo balls and chopped chicken liver
Go for self serve
Much more fun
I had a great corned beef sandwich at Katz and that was without tipping beforehand because I only had large-denomination bills in my wallet
So I'm looking forward to going back and see if the sandwich is better with the tip
The counterman seemed really concerned that I get just the right sandwich
Overall, great food and good experience
The place is really neat to see once, but at least $10 for a relatively small square sandwich (meat and bread only) - talk about a complete lack of value - I'm glad I wasn't very hungry
I tried the pastrami and corned beef (both warm), and the cold roast beef - all were good, but not quite $10-13 good, for such a small sandwich
A crowd, with many taking pictures really echoes the tourist trap it is - I'll never go again unless my tourist friends really want to go
I didn't know tipping them $1 would make a difference
still
Long time favorite for pastrami and corned beef
The food is still good but I wish the ambience was what is was 20-25 years ago

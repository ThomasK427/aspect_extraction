I highly recommend this upscale Korean restaurant
I went here to eat the other night, it was great
Much nicer than the K-town restaurants, and they still have all the main classics plus a bunch of great appetizers
We had the ahi tuna tartar and the dungeness crab rolls
The ambience was exceptional, a great match for the food
I'm going to take a couple more friends next time for the in-table grilling, it's so much fun
I went to there with my co-workers
we never tried Korean Barbeque so far
Our server kindly taught us how to cook it
We were having good time in there
Especially I love their lychee martini
The atmosphere of the Bann is so good and romantic
I was really enjoying to have dinner with my girlfriend
When I walked in the restaurant, hostess said to us Good evening with nice smile
We got 'Duck Rolls' and 'Baked scallops' as appetizers
It was pretty~~~ awesome
Especially I like the presentation of food
Our server is pretty kind and have good knowledge about food
I'll definitely enjoy Bann again
This place is nice, great atmosphere
If you want authentic Korean food then go to K-town
Give this place credit though it doesn't pretend to be 100% Korean like the other Korean places in Soho etc
for the crowd that doesn't know any better
This is Americanized Korean and it is good with a great wine selection
Highly recommended as well as the service and the decor
Egg was OK
Standouts-quality sausage, wonderful gravy and grits
Biscuits (supposedly the stand out-eh I have had much better)
It has been recommended several times but I did not find it worth the trip or wait
Our server was horrible -but the other table's server happily took up the slack- that won Egg some bonus points and saved it from being below average
As a group, we agreed food was solid
Decent porkchops, suckling pig, whole fish
The wait service was bordering on pathetic
After sitting down, we didn't get menus or water for 15 minutes
First waiter dropped my friend's wine on her after mistakenly picking up the glass to clear away (and turning it upside down!)
He did not mop up the puddle of wine left on the floor and did not comp her drink
At the time serving the starters, the sommelier and the waiter knocked over a tall glass of ice water on the same friend, this time drenching her pants
We'll pay for your drycleaning was the response
Well, my friend didn't want drycleaning
She wanted to be dry and certainly comped for something
No offer to comp anything, and no manager appeared to apologize or try to rectify the situation
I had to take it upon myself to speak to the manager and tell him the situation - nothing done in response except some sympathetic head-shaking
This restaurant is pathetic
It's pretty, but the service is pathetic and abysmal and we won't be back
My friend is a former chef/owner of a restaurant praised on Citysearch and she has never witnessed this kind of incompetency
Nice decor, average food
We went here for brunch and had to wait, wait, wait for everything! Disappointing
Its sister restaurant, Five Points, is a much better option
It's one of those restaurants you hear about and you want to try --- but once you do, you never want to go back
(Their spicy ketchup ROCKS though!!!)
We were at the restaurant the same night the last reviewer was, and agree completely with the comments about Raymond
When we left,and told the manager, Todd, how much we had enjoyed Raymond's work, he told us it was his first night on the floor
Now, that's incredible
So was the food
Every last bit of it, from the grilled fava beans, to the whole fish, to the desserts
We were there the first day, and we will keep coming back
Every server has been wonderful, but what can we say other than, if you get a chance, ask to sit in Raymond's section
The chef and owner of Five Points have opened up an equally sophisticated, stylish, service and food orientated restaurant
Service by Raymond was great
He was friendly but also understood we were on a date
Instead of just clearing the dessert plates and handing over the check - he asked if we wanted to just sit and chat before getting our check
Most American restaurants are in such a rush to turn tables over - I really enjoyed the European feel and attude of the place
Definately try the squid appetizer! The scallop entree was very interesting
A melange of flavours in your mouth that work v
well together
The decor is clean and modern
At one point, I looked around the whole restaurant and every single customer was smiling - a v
good sign
Four of us went there and i was impressed
Other than the too fruity drinks at the bar which wasn't my cup of tea, everything else was excellent
Since the food is seasonal, my specific recommendations won't help much (as i tried ordering what others wrote, unsuccessfully)
But our waiter was great and gave us great suggestions without it being pushy at all
The food portions are not huge but still generous
and the sommolier there was absolutely first-rate
After asking for what we were generally looking for, his suggestion turned out to be a fantastic wine, which suprisingly was the *least* expensive bottle on the list
Lastly, the crowd is attractive and well dressed, but not those trendy hot-spots sprinkled all over the city
It seemed people were there for a great food experience, not to be seen, which was exactly what we were looking for
Love this restaurant, the decor is wonderful-Host are truly polite and interested in helping
We did not have reservations, the host suggested eating at the bar, the two bartenders were better than any waiter I have had in NYC in months
Amazing place-food was so so good-wine by the glass menu great and not that expensive
Can't wait to go back
LOVE it and you will too
I went with 4 friends recently, and loved it
We were seated right away, although one couple was 15 minutes late
Our server was patient, and knowledgeable about the menu
It took us a while to order, because of talking
no attitude! We all loved our food, I had a ragu of vegetables, and it was so fresh and tasty! The buttermilk dressing on the romaine salad I found a blah, but the greens were impeccable
I would say skip the salad and get great sides instead with your entree
Friends loved the roast chicken, cod and steak
The spiced fries were divine, and the complementary bread with horseradish dip is dangerous(ly good)! In the last 6 months, I have been to some of the top restaurants in the city, and the freshness of the food here tops them all, at any price
My girlfriend and I had brunch there several weeks ago
I had indicated that it was our anniversary when I made the reservation and the hostess had flowers at the table for us
the food was solid
my girlfriend is a picky eater and she loved everything
the service alone is worth coming back for
Adam (our server) was totally on point and incredibly friendly
We'll be back to try dinner another time
Went to Cookshop for dinner a few wks
ago, just average, service poor both times, quality of food was decent
Had lunch there today

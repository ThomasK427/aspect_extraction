The tasty tapas, signature cocktails and wine selection was excellent
The atmosphere and ambience was perfect for an intimate evening with a large group of friends
Most importantly, the staff and owners were warm and accommodating
discreet and cozy lounge
the french windows and banquette area in the front are the prize seats in the house
tin ceilings, hardwood floors and many other details provide a sexy and romantic ambience
tapas with an asian flare and a wonderful wine selection is satisfying and complete
This review is really just for service and atmosphere- we went with a group one Sunday night for drinks after Pizza after Lombardi's- wonderful atmosphere- comfortable and warm
Our bartender/server was charming as can be
All we did was have cocktails, but it was a very pleasant experience
I'm sorry to see all of the negative reviews as we had a very nice relaxed time
The sangria was so bad that they exchanged it 4 times
The food is ok but not really tapas
Even with reservation it took them 25 mintues to seat us
Let me start out by saying, we heard great things about this place
But beginning with the attitude of the first waiter, things slid from there
The attitude was followed by inattention and continued attitude (slamming drinks down, not checking on us, tone of voice), the evening deteriorated and we simply paid for our drinks and skipped dinner
I had to seek reassurance from my friends that we had done nothing wrong
The place was not crowded and there was no other apparent reason for the horrible service for I would have loved to eat some of the cuisine others rave about
First, must mention that this is a perfect date bar
Candle lit/brick walled/cushy stooled atmosphere, combined with great food at a VERY reasonable prices
A perfect fit between neighboring Bread and Cafe Lebowitz
Tasty, beautifully presented tapas-style dishes that are pimarily asian-latin flavored make for easy sharing with whoever you're with
I tried crab croquettes, chorizo wontons, and coconut milk chicken
all GREAT
Try to get the pillowed bench seating by the open window for maximum effect
more utilitarian seating/tables are loacated in the back for groups exceeding 4-6 people
I'm afraid the word is going to get out that this place is phenomenal
Everything is just about perfect - from the atmosphere to the food - I can't recommend it highly enough
The food is outrageous - everything just about melts in your mouth (try the crispy crab roll and the teryaki calamari salad)
Best of all, the prices are extremely reasonable
I assure you nothing here will disappoint
Everything from the soup to the dessert was amazing
Extremely reasonable
Great atmosphere
The only problem was spotty service, because it seems the chef does everything tapas-style (ie
one dish at a time) even when you've chosen the entrees
No big deal, since it's very comfortable and the small wine list is excellent
A great addition to the neighborhood
This is the greatest little bar - it's the perfect combination, trendy but not pretentious
The food is amazing
I am definitely going to become a regular at this place
I must admit, I'm pretty keen on this place
The seats by the windows with the pillows are really comfortable and the atmosphere is really chill
Must try the crab croquetas, the beef empenadas, and the deep fried crab rolls
If you like tapas and asian food, you'll love this place
The Scene There's an understated, unstuffy elegance evident in everything--tidy linens, soft glowing lighting and ever-changing menu printed on thick paper and tied with twine
Service is similarly inclined: attentive and even a tad formal, but never showy
The crowd is a mix of couples and small groups, many serious foodies among them
The Food Chef Galen Zamarra's fiercely local and seasonal cooking is French in technique, yet light and straightforward on the palate
His crowning achievement is a thin slice of bigeye tuna, flash-cooked in nutty-brown butter and drizzled with balsamic vinegar
A smooth mango-parnsip soup with just-set oysters also stands out
Among entrees, the incredibly tender lamb loin, simply partnered with young artichokes, exemplifies how pristine, organic ingredients can elevate a dish
The simplest desserts, like perfect berries marinated with aromatic hibiscus flowers and topped with homemade vanilla-bean ice cream, impress most
A bit tight and snug seating wise
Interior design is very nice, lighing is pleasing if a bit dark in corners but the low-slung cieling makes oit a ibt claustrophobic depsite the airiness of the colors
T he food is all lovely and yes,light and foucsed flavors but small-precious servings
Also found the service to be highly polished but over intrusive
Wine list is relatively short and expensive
The food here is excellent and you don't have the annoyance of an over attentive wait staff
The sommelier provides perfect advice and the ambiance of the entire place is more than charming
Bar menu is available until 3AM
I lived in Avignon for 2 years where I was overwhelmed by French cuisine
Mas, by New York standards matches my dining experiences in Southern France
I long for my host family, and Mas just about matched my desire
I met my husband while studying paiting in Avingnon
Our evening at Mas came impressively close to the magical dinners we shared together in southern France
This is a gem of a restaurant
The exceptional food is matched by the extraordinary service at this find of a lifetime
My boyfriend and I were looking for just the right place to celebrate our special occasion, Mas certainly fit the bill
The food is incredibly fresh, not too mention mouth-wateringly delicious
The staff could not have been more accomodating
Made our special evening just that more special
I have been back several times and this spot has consistently rated the highest for me in food, service and overall dining experiences
The food is prepared lovingly and with just the right amount of preparation - nothing is overdone and only the freshest ingredients are used
The staff is professional and warm and although an expensive restaurant, you come out feeling like you've had a true dining experience - warm, relaxed and ready to make another reservation
Try the mushroom appetizer and the lamb entree - delish!
In a city with endless new restaurants and countless good ones, Mas shines brighter than any other
We were treated like kings, the dining room has so many beautiful details to it
You can see the effort they made and the thought that went into this restaurant
Service is friendly and not overbearing
The food was magical
I love this restaurant
I'm not sure where to begin
Mas is set on a trendy west village block, a hidden treasure
The space is just BEAUTIFUL
The staff was most accomodating and friendly
The food was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I was joined by two friends, we each had the Chef's tasting and he WOW-ed us, with one delicious course right after the other
Men if you are trying to impress a woman and want a little intimacy this is the place
The resteraunt is open, however the only people dining at Mas were serious foodies, believe me they're not intersted in your conversation
Justin our waiter, explained to us that the menu changes daily, more of a reason to return
I cannot wait to return
Mas is a fantastic restaurant that is great for a special occassion
I went with 3 other people and selected the 3 course tasting menu with wine pairing
We were able to substitute any item on the a la carte menu on the tasting menu, making it highly flexible
The appetizer course was very tasty
The fish course was fantastic - highly recommend the sea bass or the scallops
Entrees were the perfect size
The short ribs with butternut squash risotto was amongst the best I have ever sampled
Desserts are not to be missed

I have visited Tre Dici several times and each dining experience gets better! I greatly enjoyed the fabulous flavors outstanding service
The talanted fine looking Chef Giuseppe (too bad he's taken) really displays a new unique spin on Italian cuisine
The thought of his delicious thin-crusted pizzas to the homemade pastas makes my mouth water! Anyone who thinks otherwise isn't as food savvy as they think
As a side note, even the best of restaurants 'accidents' happen
We were extremely dissappointed with the service at Tre Dici
This was the worst service we've ever experienced in NYC and we go out to eat at least twice a week in NYC for the past 5 years
The waiters were rude and we felt like they were doing us favors by bringing us the food
We waited for 1 hour before our order was taken, not to mention the poor attitude throughout the meal
The food does not make up for the poor service
Unfortunately, I would definitely not recommend this restaurant
A full glass of red wine was spilled all over me, soaking my dress shirt and undershirt and staining my pants and canvas bag
The waiter apologized and said dinner is on them and send them the cleaning bill
He also brought me one of his shirts
However, he later said management wanted to offer us dessert and coffee
He also said we should leave the shirt for them to clean
We don't do coffee and dessert, so we said no thanks
Nothing else was taken off the bill instead
We couldn't see returning for the shirt when we also had to deal with cleaning the 3 other items, so we declined that offer
We have had bad things happen to us in other restaurants that we happily return to because management knew how to make amends
Instead the nice waiter is out a shirt, because we will never return
When living in NYC you have more options than many of restaurants to eat at
Tre Dici is Amazing! The atmosphere is delightful, the wait staff is superb and the food is just outstanding! The food is gourmet at a price you can't complain about
Each dish is presented and prepared with detail and elegance
You will not be disappointed in your lovely dinner here
The best part is that, its not ANOTHER american Italian restaurant, its REAL Italian
I've been following Guiseppe's culinary delights for many years now
From Felidia to Baldoria, Scopa and a few others, nothing compares to what he's done for himself
The food here is some of the best in NYC
And having eaten at what seems like every restaurant, that says a lot
The chef carefully layers flavors that just burst in your mouth
The ambiance is very sexy (as is the wait staff) and the overall experience just perfect
I honestly can't think of anything negative or of anything I would change
If you go, you must try the duck pizza
Who would have thought!!!
The food at Tre Dici was superb! The best brick oven pizza I have ever had! Everything was so fresh and delicious! I had the pastutice pasta, it was incredible! The waitstaff was exceptionally attentive
The moment my glass was empty they were right there to ask if I wanted a refill
When someone in my party got up to use the restroom, thier napkin fell on the floor, the waiter immediately came right over with a new napkin
The restaurant itself was immaculate
The bathrooms were also immaculate, you have to try the handdryers in the bathroom, they are hysterical! I highly recommend Tre Dici, I will be definitely going back!
Ever since i went to italy last year I've been searching the city for a great Italian restaurant
I've tried all the best spots and i put tre dici right along side of them! We had mussels and that lobster salad, then a middle course of the ravioli special stuffed with veal, amaretti cookies, capers and anchovies and lastly the bass baked in parchment and the hanger steak
Every course just got better and better
We cant wait to go back!
Buon appetito
what a meal we had here at tre dici
we were just walking by and saw this space and decided to try it
the lobster salad was awesome as were the ravioli plin
whole fish with fried calamari
yum
we had a great meal
a must try
not your normal italian!!
As an UES-er, I've walked by PIE a dozen times and popped in to take a look at their display
Yesterday, I finally placed a take-out order
and was VERY happy with the result! A small mushroom pie was the equivalent of two large slices of pizza; the crust was thin (the best way to eat pizza!) and the flavor light but yummy
Picture authentic Italian pizza off a side street in Rome
but without the heavy grease (and not AS authentic)
I also orderd a chef salad which was HUGE and full of yummy mozzarella and proscuitto / salami
The best part? My bill came out to $12
I will DEFINITELY be ordering again!
I am a huge fan of Radha
As one walks in he/she is immediately transported to a place of calm
Everything about this restaurant is soothing
The atmosphere is very cozy and comfortable as a result of the way this intimate restaurant has been decorated
You can sense that the owner and waiters enjoy taking special care of their guests
The soft lighting from unique lamps sets a peaceful mood from start to finish
The small bar in the front is a perfect addition, as well
And best of all is the incredible array of delicious, healthy food
The preparation of one dish is as good as the next
I highly recommend them all
This restaurant embodies the meaning of its name
Radha was our first stop with every visit we made from Miami
we looked forward to the tall glass of Lhassi drinks(mango Bombay), those yummy pekoras, those crunchy soy nuggets, the Radha Thali special dish and the heavenly cheeesecake with a mixture of blueberry strawberry topping
We could never skip that dessert, nor could we skip their peach crumble
We felt at home in that cozy atmosphere with great music in the background, the cheerful smile of Marina waiting on us
Once in a while we would indulge in their selection of great wines (chilled while Pinot Grigio Coppola's Pinot Noir are good choices)
Now that we have moved back to New York city, Radha will continue to be our favourite meeting place in the Lower East Side
Whether it is after a movie at the Sunshine theater, or after a shopping trip to Soho, we know there is Radha restaurant around the corner to staisfy our hunger for a great vegetarian meal served with a most friendly staff
After traveling around the world in search of the best vegi restaurants I found radha by accident
I am at present living in melbourne australia where some of the worlds best veg restaurants exist
Yet none of them compete with this little beauty
Named after sri radha the queen of love and devotion its not surprizeing how I got hooked
I often dream of there soychicken nuggets and with that homemade sauce yum yum U Just cant go wronge infact there was not one thing I didnt like on there menu and I went there every nite of my nyc trip
U just cant go wronge the atmosphere is superb and the waiting staff treat u like kings and queens its just a MUST!!!
When we read that Radha on Ludlow street was nominated for an award by Time Out Magazine, we were thrilled
It deserves to be known by all those who seek a healthful meal, a great atmosphere where the eclectic music in the background is relaxing, the lighting is just right and the service is more than good
We love their selection of organic wines, not to mention the delicious Mango Bombay lhassi
We highly recommend it
It is aplce where you would always want to go back to with your dates, family friends
What a comfortable vibe this new vegetarian restaurant has
Their menu is very diverse and mostly vegan
Their Soychicken Tortilla was sooo delicious, as was the scrumptious Chocolate Raspberry cake
I felt very satisfied with the mood of the place with its soft music, friendly staff and great food
I'm definetly recommending Radha to all my friends
One of the best vegetarian restaurants I have dined at
I thoroughly enjoyed the pekoras and the chicken soy nuggets loved the peach crumble pie
A very pleasant atmosphere and great service
I would definitely go back and try all the other dishes that looked quite scrumptious
When we walked into this discreetly elegant vegetarian restaurant tucked away on Ludlow street, we did not know that we were going to have the best treat
Constantly on the lookout for GOOD vegetarian restaurants

The chic restaurant has an elegant decor with a great bar
It was very romantic and a terrific place to go to for a special night out
This place has an amazing Austrian menu with a great Austrian wine list to match
I loved every bite of my spaetzle and rabbit, delectable crepes with trout and horseradish, and monkfish
Desserts were exceptionally good, and I tried some new wines made from Austrian grapes that I'm going to have to try to find to buy to have at home
The chef came out and was hanging out at the bar for part of the night, something that I thought was great
He really has his finger on the pulse of his restaurant
The whole place had an exotic Austrian vibe - a very cool place to go
This review is long overdue
My husband and I went there for our wedding anniversary last spring and we had a very pleasant dining experience
We seldomly go to West Village and we found this restaurant randomly online
Because we were there for an early dinner the dining room was pretty open
The server misunderstood our appetizer order so we ended up getting an appetizer for free (no complaints there!)
The overall service from all the staff was curteous
Now let's talk food
My husband is a very picky eater and he seldomly ever raves about a restaurant
With Wallse, he was very impressed with our dinner
We had octopus and salad for starters, he had fish and I had scallops as entree
Perfectly flavored fresh food at a charming West Village restaurant served by professional staff - what more can you ask for!
Very nice food/atmosphere
NYC is blessed to have both this and Danube as outstanding Viennese/Hungarian restaurants
The food here is a little hipper than Danube - and also not quite as good
Schnitzel is a bit heavy and the lobster potato rosti starter would have been divine had the lobster had any taste
Appetizer of spatzle and rabbit was best thing we tasted
Very nice space - and service was friendly if a bit absent-minded
I have been thinking about my amazing dinner at wallse all day
A golden Schnitzel and a light chocolate souffle
delicious
!!! Definitely a place that I would recommend
I visit New York often and have just discovered Wallse and I absolutely love it
There are so few restaurants that have great food, great art, and a hip crowd but manage to be friendly as well--but Wallse is one of them
The clientele is distinguished and it is not hard to imagine that the understated elegance is not so different from the exciting days of turn of the century Vienna
Yet what impressed me most was that somehow the staff made everyone that entered feel like kings and queen with a grace that makes some of the more trendy restaurants seem so clumsy
The food here is great
Well done chef
Now, the service
The staff here did their job but were careful to withold any semblance of charm or warmth, just enough to let you know that you were lucky to be in their presence
I'm sure most New Yorkers will find this scenario depressingly familiar
No wonder Danny Meyer restaurants are always booked out
Be nice to people, and they will return
I won't be returning here
You know that when the food is consistently this good that the chef is in the kitchen
A great find, if you can find it, and worth the trip to the West Village
I can't recommend it more highly
Try one of their great cocktails or an Austrian wine
No California chardonnay here
Artistic and rustic at the same time, the decor is warm and inviting
One of the best restaurants in New York, hands down
The food and ambience were excellent
However, service was awful
We sat at 8 pm
Waiter took our orders after 1 hour of seating at the table without bread or drinks
Entrees came at 10 pm
We complained to the manager and he retorted that our wait was part of the dining experience!!! Waiter mixed up still water and tap water (what's the point of order still water then?)
I recommend that the staff take a crash course in customer serivce
In the near past, a young women on a date discovers that all life in the city may be nothing more than an elaborate facade created by a malevolent psuedo- intelligence called men
For the purpose of placating us while our life essence is farmed by the awsome chef kurt
Wallse's fuel helps to lead the campaign of domination, courtship, and dining within the struggle of the real world
What a great place
I often walk by and always peek in, because the interior is so beautiful
Then I look forward to my next visit of excellent food and great service in a truly charming interiour
I ate brunch and dinner there many times
I could go there every day (and eat venison)
This restaurant is beautiful
with just the right degree of formality/casualness
The design is clean and sleek, service perfect
Kurt Gutenbrenner (sp?) from what I understand was supposed to open Danube with Bouley and instead opened this place on his own
I've been to both, Danube once, and I've been back to Wallse many times, because it is much more comfortable, accessible, charming and I liked the food better
I wish this place the very best success!!
What an amazing meal! Just delicious
I had perfect service and I learned a lot
It is the only all Austrian wine list in the country and the waitress gladly broke it down for me, so I could find just the right wine for my meal
I felt surrounded by people who were really enjoying themselves and the Chef kept popping out of the kitchen to say Hello to various tables
In Short A sweeping spiral staircase allows everyone to make a grand entrance at this subterranean spot
The space is blessed with two bars--one near the lounge rotunda filled with low slung leather chairs; the other stretches the length of the spacious and colorful dining room
Executive Chef Julian Alonzo, a Bouley disciple, cooks new American cuisine with French and Asian influences
Zucchini blossoms and crab cake are among the first courses, with arctic char, roasted pig, filet mignon as entrees
I don't understand what all the hype is all about for this restaurant
I can think of so many other great restaurants in NYC with better decor and food
The menu was nothing special (I had to switch my entree choices several times because the server told me that the portion is really REALLY small!) The decor? Yeah the grand staircase is nice but that's about it
there was no scene or what so ever for 9:30 pm on a Friday
Perhaps, Sunday brunch might be a better choice, considering you can't screw up an omelette
I have passed this restaurant for years never realizing it was there
What a great restaurant, from the moment you enter to the time you leave you are taking care of
The food is creative, well presented incredible to the eye and the flavors are just out of this world
Service is professional without being over bearing The decor is georgous and has become one of my very favotite restaurants in New York
I think Brasserie 8 1/2 is midtown's best kept secret
From beginning to end this place is delightful
The chef sends out a little amuse buche to get you started then tickles your tastebuds with each course
Desserts are especially good here and worth coming for just on their own! It will leave you on a sugar high!
First time dining here
Overall feel of place is upscale, and ever-so-slightly snotty
Decor/layout impressive
I went during Rest
Week, expecting quality of food prep for Rest
Week folks to be below usual standards due to the nature of the week
I must say however that in fact, the entire meal was sublime
Appetizer of ravioli stuffed with lamb, served with squash puree just melted in my mouth
Cod with potatoe/cod pancake was divine
Dessert of chocolate ice cream w/vanilla sauce also very good

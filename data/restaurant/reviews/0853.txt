I went to Ida Mae as usual
They were closed a note said there were equpment problems
I went a few days later and they were only open for apps
The bartender, the Mgr
, and the Chef eluded questions on when they would be in full swing
It seems my favourite restaurant is closing
I'm in this business and this restaurant has all the signs
What a shame
When you walk into Ida Mae, you immediately enter a very warm, welcoming environment
Once we were seated, however, things went downhill
The hostess failed to give us menus, and we had to ask our waiter for them
We also had to ask him, several times, for water
It took a very long time for our appetizers to arrive, as well as our meal and the check
The problem was that there were only two waiters in the entire restaurant that evening
The food, however, was worth the wait
The sweet potato ravioli melts in your mouth
The lobster was excellent
Because the food was so good, I will give this establishment another chance
I hope the service has improved by my next visit
I went to this restaurant last week, This was one of the best dining experiences of my life
My server( I think her name was Christine) was wonderful
Everything she recomended was delish
The crab avocado, the crabcake,(wait til you taste the salad that comes with it) the mushroom, the yellow tail snapper, the barbeque shrimp, I wish I had a bigger stomach, I would have eaten so many other options on the menu
The chef came by , what a talented man (he's the ex-chef of Maroons) All I can say is check this spot out
I went to Ida Mae some time ago for drinks, and what drinks they were!!! I personally recommend the watermelon martini, made with FRESH watermelons
Yummy! The appetizers were delicious and the service was wonderful
The location caters to a varied, upscale crowd and the vibe is totally wonderful
The drinks are a little pricey, but I thought they were absolutely worth the price tag
Ida Mae makes you feel at home, particularly in the lounge area that greets you upon entry
This place is definitely worth a look, a drink and a little more than a nibble
Enjoy!
When Ida Mae opened, it gave a choice of upscale dining for the Garment/Fashion District
At least that's how it was while I was frequently visiting during the first few years mainly for lunch and after work drinks
Returning for dinner after a year was not even a close experience
The menu changed completely with only couple of the signature dishes remained, Cajun Tuna, Sweet Potato Ravioli Mushroom Napoleon
Also prices seemed to go further North while the quality of the service moved South
Having only two servers for the entire dining room is not the smartest move a restaurateur could make as well as possibly downsizing the kitchen staff
I would suggest the new management (Mr
Kenneth Collins is no longer with the establishment) to hire more and experienced servers and maintain a better quality in food and service
Adjusting the prices towards the South won't hurt either
The food was very good and the atmosphere was great
However, the service was lacking
Our waitress was never to be found
We ended up having to go to the bar to order drinks
The kicker, however, was the nerve to add an 18% tip for a party of three at the bar! The restaurant said it was standard
I've never heard of such a thing
No wonder the waitress didn't care to give us any service
She knew she was getting 18% no matter what she did
I went to Ida Mae's twice
Once with my fiance and once with friends
Both times we found the service to be great
We did think the cost was unnecessarily pricey
Nonetheless the food was pretty good
I highly recommend the Chilean Sea Bass and the sweet potato ravioli
The drinks were also good
The owner spoke to us and asked how the service was both times-I thought that was also great! I recommend it!
The food at Ida Mae's was excellent however the service was not
As I waited for my entire party to be seated the hostess talked about my friends and me to other waiters in the restaurant
The waiters as well as the manager stared at us the entire evening and made us all feel extremely uncomfortable
We complained to our waiter serveral times about this and the stares continued and to top it all off as the manager walked around to each table asking if they enjoyed their dinner, he conveniently did not ask us!
The whole staff was professional and extremely nice during our lunch, and our waitress gave us great food recommendations
The appetizers were delish (get the sweet potato ravioli), but the entrees were a bit pricey, though portions were generous
Overall, one of the few really good restaurants, especially for the area
I went here on a date and I could not have been more enthralled by the place
I am a foodie in every sense of the word and this was the best meal I have had in ages
The chef came out of the kitchen to greet us- and he was quite the handsome charmer
The poached lobster and grits main course was outstanding as was the sweet potato ravioli and wild mushroom napoleon
The chocolate dessert with graham cracker crust was out of this world- i just brought a big group of girlfriends back to celebrate a birthday and we had drinks in the lounge first before our meal
Everyone was thrilled with the choice
Ida Mae is a winner!
A new spot in the hear of the fashion district is a truly refreshing experience
The atmosphere is similar to a scene out of The Great Gatsby or some 1920's speakeasy with sexy jazz music playing in the background
The sweet potato ravioli appetizer was exquisite and the brown sugar cured Chilean seabass will soon be a signature dish for this place
the best I've had
It's a wonderful place to go for a special occasion or a hot date
The food at Ida Mae was GREAT
however, the SERVICE was HELL
The waitress, who was pleasant at first
turned into quite a character after she SPILLED 2 glasses of champagne on me
I was completely soaked (hair, shirt, skirt, etc) - and all I received was a lame sorry
In addition, the manager refused to come over to apologize - but told the waitress to offer us TWO desserts on the house- when there were FOUR people dining
THREE of whom got wet
Finally, the chef came out to apologize at the end of our meal, but it was too late
Ida Mae definitely needs to take some lessons in customer service and hospitality!!!
I went to Ida Mae after reading the great reviews and I was not overly impressed
I had the house salad and the scallops and both were good, but not so good that I would go back to get them
While these were only two items on the menu, they didn't inspire me
Our waiter was a bit weird as well, but the lounge area looked like a nice place to get a drink after work
I feel like they were trying a bit too hard to impress and the whole experience fell a little flat
I have visited Ida Mae for drinks and dinner on a number of occasions since they first opened in June
The kitchen is creating some truly amazing dishes, yet the atmosphere is not pretentious
It's a comfortable place and there is always a nice looking crowd
The service is definitely improving
I think Ida Mae is going to do great things
I, for one, am going to follow this chef's career closely
There isn't a hit southern hospitality in Ida Maes kitchen
The hostess, no personality and obviously doesn't like her job
We were however seated right away and was immediately told by our waiter that they were out of sparking mineral water
I probably would have not minded but thats what I like to drink
Its one thing to run out at 11pm but 8pm on Thursday at un upscale restaurant in Manhattan is unacceptable

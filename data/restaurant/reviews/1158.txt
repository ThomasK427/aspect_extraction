1?), and the service -- which suspiciously comes up for praise in 16 straight reviews -- was extremely bad
My ceasar salad amounted to some limp lettuce and mayo strewn around a large plate, and the only way I might have died for the mac and cheese is due to natural causes while waiting for it to arrive
I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this place
The portions, the service, the food
The Burger is Phenom
Brunch is next!
I threw my husband's 30th birthday party here the other night and everyone had a great time
The food was amazing, the ambience was intimate and cozy, and the service was top notch
Big thanks to Mark Matyas for putting everything together without a hitch
This is a perfect place to throw a really nice party with close friends
I can't say nicer things about this place
See for yourself!
On the weekends they have live bluegrass music during brunch, really fun
The food is very good and the cocktails are marvelous
The cocktail menu is written on the wall -- like on a chalkboard
The inside reminds you very much of a school house (as it's supposed to)
The bathrooms are clean, the staff is very good and seating is prompt even when it's busy
I wulved it awlot
I live in Maryland and was in NY for business
A co-worker recomended this restaurant while I was in NY
His advice was right on the money
The food was excellent for the price
And one of the managers even remebered my co-worker, who had been there three to four months earlier (I don't know if that is good or bad/just kidding)
The staff was very polite and professional, and the food was delicious
I didn't make it to brunch, that I was told so much about
But next time I am in NY for the weekend, I will surely try it
Oh Oh Oh, try the sangria, I normally drink whisky, but it was a good change of pace
This place has gotten lots better since opening last year
They have greatly improved their cooking techniques and the pizzas are very good
I really like the pan sauteed calamari salad - hard to find on most city menus
My boyfriend likes the maccheese that comes with a salad, and the burger
These dishes are the staples that I recommend
they serve sangra, which is always fun in the summer, and there's a big open window for a breeze
I really like this 'hood - Jane across the street is good, too
Every time I visit New York I am drawn to Nolita House
This is everything I expect and more from a New York restaurant/bar
The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly, the service and waiting staff fantastic, food out of this world (and as for the pizzas - yum - the original Italian style just as mama intended)
Congratulations to the owner(s) and staff, I look forward to my next visit with great anticipation! Very well done
I just want to say that I saw this place written up in the NY Times as a artisan cheese haven, and I wasn't let down
Their $10 for 2 cheeses and wine is awesome
I will be back
Went there for dinner the other night and had nothing short of a fantastic experience
The service was impeccable, the food was delish and the atmosphere was relaxed/v
welcoming
The staff knew their stuff and the host was tre hospitable
I was only in town for two days and went there for Dinner
The food was delicious
I was undecided as to what I wanted to order, but I think between me and my friends we had almost one of everything on the menu
We enjoyed everything from the veggies to the seafood and the ribs
We were told that the brunch was delicious as well
So we went back the next day
Not only was the food delicious, but the French toast looked like it should be framed in a picture
I can't describe it, but I highly recommend ordering it, you won't be disappointed
And yes we went back for dinner before we left NY
When we go back to NY, Nolita House will definately be one of our stops
And if any of the owners or employees read this, many thanks for the excellent food and service
Lived in the area for a few years and always just passed this place by when it was Risa Pizza
I thought I'd give the new place a try since it had an expanded menu and a more legit look
Went on a Tuesday, was sparsely filled, but filled up later that night
Regardless, the low-key, laid-back vibe and friendly staff set the tone for really solid meal
The food was flavorful and the wines were great
Had the salmon which was very good and the duck arugula salad which was also a hit
Of course we had to try a side of the mac n cheese which did not disappoint
After we paid and before we left they brought us some raspberry brownies as a test for a new dessert they're thinking of adding to the menu
Happy to find a neighborhood joint with good food and cool people
great food for it's value! love the music! i wanted a glass of white wine but was confused w/ their selection, asked the waitress for her suggestion and she was nice enough to let me sample the wine she suggested before pouring me an entire glass
NOW THATS SERVICE! will definately be back
My wife and I stumbled across Nolita House on our way to the movies and we decided to have just a quick drink
We ended up staying for dinner and missed the movie
The mac n cheese was the best I have ever had
The service was gracious and attentive and overall the place was very cozy
We will defnitely be back
I ate at Nolita House recently and had wonderful service
In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by how knowledgeable our waiter was and appreciated his suggestions/recommendations
The food is delicious and the cheese plates are great
I would definitely recommend this place!
in a not at all crowded restaurant, my friends and i experienced the worst service i have ever encountered in a new york city restaurant
the appetizers and the main courses were good, but the service was so horrendous
our waiter could care less about our table, he ignored us for most of the evening
and the white chocolate tart tasted really really bad
I had Sauteed Mussels and i couldn't believe my mouth! It was absolutely delicious to the point where i went back and asked for a variety plate They were so nice to accomodate me and gave me almost everything on the menu to taste from
You gotta check it out!
We loved it
This is a really feel good restaurant
Not only the food (which was exceptional!) but the service and the atmosphere just makes you think that you are having a great time in a good friend's home
Congrats to the owners
they captured comfort
Had a great meal here on Friday night
The grilled vegetable platter was amazing, our salmon and chicken dishes were done perfectly
The wine list is simple, affordable and comprehensive
The waitstaff was incredibly attentive and cheery
Definitely going back
We love this cozy, little spot on Houston - just opened
Excellent comfort food (mac cheese) and brunch (baked berry french toast)
What a wonderful experience I had recently
from the moment you enter, you are greeted by a friendly and attentive staff
The waiter was knowledgeable and helpful in making suggestions
The grilled chicken wings and pan fried calamari are wonderful and great to share
The mac and cheese is to die for as are many other main dishes including the pork ribs, roast chicken and traditional spaghetti meatballs
Be sure to save room for one of their cheese plates offered in a creative (and helpful!) way - beginner to adventurous

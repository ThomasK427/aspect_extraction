The food from the wood burning over was crispy and delicious and the wine selection was huge
This place is the perfect pairing of light food and wine all for a price that will let you still have enough for popcorn
The worst service I have ever had in a NYC restaurant
I not really one to complain about service if the food is okay, but this place is just bad
The our waiter got out order wrong twice and I was charged an extra $57 for a $27 brunch
I spoke to the management about our the charge but it ended up on my card anyway and I had to go through my bank to clear it up
Staff is careless and mangement is as well
I took my mother here for her birthday and absolutely loved it! The brunch was delicious and they offered 3 free margaritas as part of the meal
Drinks sneak up on you so watch out
Staff was friendly and welcoming
All in all a great little spot in the village
This is what eating at a restaurant is supposed to be about
impeccable taste, succulent food, stellar service - an absolutely breathtaking experience
The beluga caviar sushi is an absolute must, and fatty tuna is my personal favorite, but if you want to taste a little bit of everything, try the Chef's Grand Tasting Plate
nothing compares! Take it from this restaranteur
I've been around, but this place is BAR NONE!!
TALK ABOUT QUALITY, QUALITY, QUALITY
NO EXPENSE HAS BEEN SPARED AT WAVE
I WENT TO EAT HERE WITH MY GF BASED ON PRIOR RECOMMENDATIONS
IF YOU WANT A TOTALLY CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT WITH TRULY THE BEST QUALITY FISH THEN THIS IS YOUR PLACE
SOME OF MY FRIENDS SAY ITS THE NEW ISO'S
DEF A PLACE TO COME WITH A LADY OR WITH YOUR BUDDIES AS YOU CAN HAVE A CHOICE OF A PRIVATE BANQUET TABLE OR HANG OUT BY THE BAR
YES A FULL BAR IS AVAILABLE
A girlfriend and I went to have lunch and drinks at Crema about a month ago, and it was the best food I have had in quite a while
We sat at the bar and were promptly served by a youthful looking bartender
The mojito I had was the best I've ever tasted in my life
We were then served chips and habanero salsa, along with the massive 2 courses of the price fixe lunch
By far, the tostadas I had were the best in the city
The dinner menu looks like it has a more interesting selection of entrees, but if they are even the fraction of the quality of the items we ate for lunch, I whole-heartedly advise you to make it a point and dine at Creama--if not for the drinks, then definitely for the unique approach to mexican
My new favorite Mexican restaurant
The food is a refined Mexican; capturing the best flavors of Mexican cuisine combined with haute cuisine touches of brilliance
The decor follows suit with a Mexican theme without the usual kitsch
Culinary highlights include the guacomole (although the portion is small, order it with soft corn tortillas for a real treat), soup w/ huitlacoche, and flautas de pollo
Service was attentive and the meal was nicely paced
Skip the speciality cocktails (typical fruity overpriced concoctions) and the wine list (limited and overpriced) and head for a margarita or beer to wash down the delicious offerings
I'll be back!
I am skeptical of new Restaurants, but have to admit i went there with my girlfriend and we had a wonderful time
From the get go the Hostess was welcoming, friendly and professional
I imagine whoever gave her a bad report forgot to take the daily Prozac or must be the typical neurotic and arrogant newyorker
I am a foreigner by the way, so i often notice this kind of people dinning out and being rude to servers
The ambience, waiter and food were superb
The food was tasty - especially the chilean sea bass
The Imperial Margarita was more than satisfactory
Found the decor to be pleasantly understated for a Mexican restaurant and placement of the open kitchen to fit in nicely with the space
Cocktail menu was mouth-watering and the bar space was well laid out
Surprisingly limited entree options, but quality is strong for what's there
But if you like this place, I think you'll love Hell's Kitchen
Visited Crema last night and enjoyed the food
The hostess was another story
I called the day of the reservation to confirm
After 5 minutes of searching, the person stated that they found my 8:00 reservation
We arrived at Crema at 7:50 and the hostess advised she had no record of my reservation
She showed me a handwritten list of reservations and asked me to find my reservation
Im not sure why the computer at the hostess desk was not used for reservations
After several discussions with her over the next hour, she eventually seated us
She indicated that she would send something over to our table as a result of the reservation mix up
This never happened
All the other people in the lounge area had experienced similar reservation snafus
Crema clearly needs to move to the automated reservation system and get someone resembling a competent hostess in place
We visit NY 3 or 4 times a year to attend Broadway shows and always like to try some of the new and upcoming restaurants
Crema was amazing! Not only was the food a treasure find, but you must have at least one of their fantastic margaritas
One of the best parts of the experience was the service
They should charge a cover when they seat you with our waiter
We watched as he dealt with some unrelenting guests,keeping it positive and funny all the while and giving Broadway style entertainment
He kept his whole section in stitches, while navigating the high maintence tables with total professionalism
We almost wanted to stay and not go see our show because we were having such a good time
We had to resist coming back the next night, but we will be back on the next trip
I went here for brunch and shared several things with my friends and everything we had was really, really delicious and creative
The flavors are really exquisite and unusual and the portions were a good size - even sharing we had plenty
The restaurant itself is beautiful and was very relaxing
I plan to be a regular!
I heard great things about this restaurant and was really excited to try it
Although all the food had great flavors, several fried dishes came out soggy and just not up to par for the price
The waiter seemed to want to be anywhere but there and he made us feel like we were holding him up and I find that just inexcusable
I became a fan of the chef's when she was at Mexicana Mama, and all I can say is she's taken her talent for making delicious, innovative food and done it even better
The food is truly excellent, the wait staff very nice, and the ambiance is delightful (and the margaritas are yummy!)
It's a bit loud, and a reservation is recommended for dinner at least
Definitely check it out
Great food
Innovative, well prepared and delicious
Pleasant decor with nice lighting
However! Our experience with the person who took our order was horrendous
Snippy catty comments, distant glances, sighs, pauses and eye rolling when being spoken to were outrageously unprofessional
Basically we were made wrong just for asking a simple question
I cant imagine the owner of this lovely restaurant wanting to project this sort of image as a newcomer in the neighborhood
This is not Food Bar
I brought clients here for lunch and it was a huge hit!!! I am always a little nervous trying a new place but what a pleasant suprise! The space is bright with great decor
The only way to describe the food is phenomenal
The trendy music playing softly in the background is a nice touch
The $17 Prix Fixe lunch makes it easy on the expense account or the wallet, if you are there off the company dime
The portions are a little small but maybe that's just becuase it was lunch
I will definitley be back!!!
joined a friend here for lunch last week - was absolutely blown away by the food, the atmosphere the charm of this little hideaway spot
YOU MUST HAVE THE CREAM OF CORN SOUP
Mexican food with french flair - NOT TO BE MISSED!!!!
Thoroughly enjoyable dining experience -- fantastic food, unpretentious ambience, strong drinks, and attentive service
Would recommend the guacamole and salsa, the scallop appetizer and the sea bass for an entree
If you're looking for an amazing experience for your taste buds, take a trip to Crema Restaurante now before the reviews come out
Don't walk, RUN! Everything on the menu is mind-altering
My favorite being the Chilean Sea Bass served on a bed of mashed plantains

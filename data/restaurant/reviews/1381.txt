The music was to my liking (ambient/electro) and the service was great
But of course the food was the highlight of our experience
It was a nice touch on Morimoto's part to come out of the kitchen and meet greet guests at the front door at times
Heated seats in the women's bathroom was a nice touch, although I'd be a little nervous to utilize the bidet
:o
My day started out at a wake of a friend and as I listened to the words expressed that day I said I needed to do something I have been wanting to do now
I knew of Morimoto in Philly but never got the chance to go and then Morimoto in NYC opened and it has been my goal to go and have the Omakase menu
Well Friday Night I did that sort of for myslef and in honor of my friend and from the first of nine beautiful dishes Chef Morimoto did not disappoint
It was art on a plate it was as beautiful to look at as it was to taste
My fiancee and I drank White Lily's with our meal which were some of the best tasting cocktails we have had to date as well
I also got to see Morimoto in the kitchen preparing some food
I recently went to Morimoto to see what all the buzz was about, and found out first hand why Morimoto is the Iron Chef
My clients and I all had the chefs tasting menu, or omakase
9 Courses perfectly arranged dishes, kicked off with a colorful toro tartar, followed by an aray of wonderful dishes including an amazing kobe beef dish on sauteed bamboo shoots
The meal had it all, including a fantastic pistachio/almond cake dessert
The door was hassle free, service amazingly friendly and knowledgeable
MM Diaginjo Sake is not to be missed!   AAA+++++****  Next time I'm booking the omakase bar for Morimoto to be my personal Iron Chef!!!
Yes yes I am a big Iron chef fan
and I have eaten with all of the iron chefs before including Sakai, Chen, Michiba, Nakamura, Kobe
I must say that this restaurant by Morimota by far the worst
Lets not compare this to other iron chef run restaurants anyway
Nobu is 10 times better then this
After waiting over 45 minutes after our time of reservation, we have tasted the flaky Kobe beef, dry lobster, tasteless rolls
I wonder if Morimoto is aware of these tasteless issues
Poor management and below par food
Following the rules and calling at 9:00 a
m
exactly 30 days before my New York visit--only to be told the only thing left was at the sushi bar at 10:00 p
m
Okay, so I was so desperate at that point I took it
Fortunately, that is indeed the best place to sit, as it turns out, because the regular tables are so close together you can't avoid listening to your neighbor's conversation
At least at the sushi bar the sushi chefs are somewhat entertaining to watch!   We were starving by the time we were shown to our seats
I can only say the food was average, but the prices are through the roof
My lobster was dry and overcooked
I was so tired I can't remember what my husband had, but he wasn't thrilled
and it was Believe me, this dining experience isn't worth waiting for
3 days a go i had dinner
everthing went very well and without notesing we were ther 3 hours
Took a client here
Of course, we ordered the signature order, Omakase $120
that's where it starts
We also had 2 small bottle of premium Sake at $44 each
The wait staff was amazingly attentive and friendly
The food was good, some items great, but overall, I was wondering why I didn't order the Kobe beef as several went by me and it smelled great
(Its American Kobe, not Japanese FYI
) Overall
I agree with previous write ups about it being over-hyped and way over-priced
My guess is that these price will come down significanlty within a year or Mr
Morimoto will be starting a new restaurant
The price was so expensive, that I was embarrased to present my expense to my boss
and I have never felt that way before in 20 years
My suggestion, go to 3 or 4 other 5 star restaurants for the price of this
Need I say more? I went to Morimoto, as I happened across it walking home late one evening in the winter, and was confronted with not 1, not 2, but 3 bones in my sushi
The lobster was gummy and the snapper was overcooked
The staff was semi-apologetic and quasi-concerned
I won't ever go back there again
Iron Chef
I get why people feel the need to check out morimoto
I have to be honest, I'm so over these insanely priced spots
We were able to reserve a spot at the chef tasting bar with Morimoto who actually called in sick that night, but we were still charged full price
The service was incredible, the food presentation was artwork quite delicious but $200 a head (9 that didn't include drinks) COME ON! The portions were so small the time between each one made wine consumption out of control
All I wanted was a slab of something
I suppose I'd go back to check out the regular menu but only if I felt like dealing with the pain of overpaying for a meal
The design was horrible and cheap looking even though I know it wasn't
Downstairs lounge was more acceptable
Hostesses and staff are very professional attentive
No attitude found here
I liked the tasting menu for $120 (worth it) as no skimping on portion or ingredients
Didn't blow me away though! Cocktails sounded interesting but ended up tasting weak w/ lack of flavor and alchie
A fellow chef and I went to Morimoto
I was a fan of the chef before eating at his restaurant
After making reservations a month in advance, we had to wait in the basement bar for 40 MINUTES before sitting
With 8:15pm reservations, we were starving before seeing a menu
Menu pricing is inconsistent- with apps at $20 and entrees $30-40, $120pp for omakase=insanity! We could've ordered ten entreesappetizers
The woman next to us had omakase--not impressive
I know her feelings, since the tables are too close
We ordered three apps, two entrees, and two desserts
Entrees were sad, including cheap teriyaki on steak desribed as onion jus and overcooked lobster and dead clams in bouillabaise
Two appetizers were good (curry beef and crab leg), the third was poor (sampler)
Dessert1 was chocolate tart trainwreck; dessert2 was good earl grey icecream and perfect, fruity cremebrule
Don't waste your money here
Kudos to one of the original Iron Chefs!!! After having drinks at the bar, we were led upstairs and seated promptly
We ordered several 7 appetizers (the tuna pizza is awesome!! and the king crab!!) and about 4 main courses (kobe beef!!!) which were all prepared wonderfully
Morimoto actually came from behind the sushi station and over to our table to ask if everything was to our liking and were we having a good time and of course we were!!! The hosts at the front and the waitstaff are very attentive and I cannot wait to go back!!!
I had the omakase at the restaurant, I found it to be more hype than anything else
We had a total of 6 small courses, 1 intermezzo and 1 dessert that were artfully presented
The presentation was a plus but the food was mediocre and generic
The main entree was a surf and turf of red snapper and beef
The beef was done nicely but the snapper was over cooked
After finishing dinner we went to thank Morimoto but he he was too busy to acknowledge our presence
I should of heeded the NYT review I read that morning
we went to Morimoto, and had the most amazing dining experience ever
following my friend's advice, i made a reservation for my friend's birthday at the omakase bar
they make you take the shoes off and it starts from $200, but it's definitely worth it! we couldn't believe that the Iron Chef was cooking right in front of us! every single dish was unbelievable: fresh tofu with truffle, blowfish carpaccio, meaty crab, amazing sushi, wagyu shortrib that just melted in my mouth, and beautiful two-course desserts
unreal! for all the 15 courses(?), $200 sounds like a bargain
the waitress was not only attentive but so passionate and friendly
The highlight was that Mr
Morimoto and chefs did special birthday song for my friend! i would go back for any special occasion for an unforgettable evening
if you can afford, don't go to the dining room, go to the omakase bar!
Went for the name

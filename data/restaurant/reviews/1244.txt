Music was so bad, too (those tunes you get to hear from daytime radio)
My friend and I've been there twice and agreed we'd had enough
Never again
This restaurant has the most authentic sushi and sashimi I've tasted outside Japan
The fish is fresh and delicious
Definitely a gem
I ate here with 2 friends and we all loved our sushi sashimi
Everything was very fresh well prepared
My only complaint is that my sashimi special ($30) offered fewer varieties than my friends' sushi deluxes, and that they actually got more food as well
Perhaps it's the cuts of fish that you pay more for? Something a non-Japanese like I can't understand
Anyhow, there were a lot of Japanese people seated at the bar, eating chatting up the chefs, surely that's a good sign of authentic sushi
The service was somewhat inattentive though when you sit at a table
I was a little weary to arrive at this joint and find it on Restaurant Row, which, as any NYC local would know, is very honkytonk and touristy
We caught the tail end of pre-theater so the restaurant was about a third full
Despite my misgivings, the food was good and the price slightly higher than similar nearby Thai restaurants not located on the Row but certainly not expensive
The atmosphere is bland and non-descript and the service is fine
Not much else to say
I tried this restaurant couple time and overall, the Pad Thai is excellent compare to other thai restaurants in the area
Service is always very accomodating!! Recommended!!
The service was full of smiles here and very accomodating
I always order my thai basil noodles with light oil cause to much always takes away from the flavor
No one ever does it right but this place did, my food was delicious and the adorable servers put a smile on my face the second I walked in
Once I loved this restaurant, because its taste, service, price and volume were all good
However, for these day, taste and volume are falling down unexpectedly
As it may depend on the cook's skill and policy, next time, I will try its sister restaurants
Me and my friend had the prefix dinner
It was well worth the money we paid for
The food was delicious
And the service and ambience was excellent
We were able to try different things on the menu without spending too much money
I definitely recommend you make a reservation in advance
Great place for delivery
have never been to the restaurant but will try to check it out soon
Prompt service, friendly, and the food is delicious and reasonably priced
Accept no imitations! In a neighborhood that is frankly saturated with Thai restaurants, Bangkok House is really the only Hell's Kitchen option that's worth going out of your way for
The atmosphere is mellow and relaxing, the food is tasty, light and inexpensive, the service quick and attentive, and the waitresses, for lack of a better word, are hot-- a not unimportant consideration when it comes to Thai restaurants
Also, it's a good spot for a date-- classy, but also not a wallet-buster
I've been to the Bangkok House over 20 times this year
The Coconut Soup is excellent! All the soups are great
The mussles are a very good appetizer, I love the sweet and sour shrimp and the shimp/chicken massaman
The ambiance is beautiful and the bathroom was clean
Very croweded but fast service!! Highly recommended
My friend and I were there on the past Sunday (5/8/05), but I am very disappointed on the food quality
We ordered the Spicy Shrimp Soup (Tom Yum Goong), the soup is NOT spicy at all, and it's not sour either
That's the worst Spicy Shrimp Soup I ever had
We also ordered the special dish that day, Scollop something
it was OK
The fish entree that I had was Pla Rad Prigg, and it was so-so, can tell the fish wasn't freshly cooked, it was deeply fried a while ago
I just dont think I will go back again
If you are looking for traditional thai food, that's not a place for you
Great place to get some authentic Thai food in the city
Definitley a restaurant to vosot at least once
One of the better Thai restaurant in Manhattan
Not one of those Americanize bland Thai restaurant that you couldn't tell the difference with a chinese restaurant
Traditional Thai dishes with a little twist
Friendly service and reasonable price
In Short The bright space is lit by colorful jeweled chandeliers and features rustic arches above prints of Pamplona
The Valencian chef is inspired by the foods of all 17 Spanish regions
Choices extend from paella and gambas al ajillo (shrimp in garlic oil), to tortillas Espanola and corbero a la segoviana (roasted lamb)
The full menu is served at the granite bar, where Spanish sherries and wines, such as Oloroso and Rioja, are poured
I have been looking for this restaurant for YEARS! Absolutely the most authentic spanish food in the city! The restaurant itself if gorgeous, beautiful art and design, my boyfriend and i loved the atmosphere
The tapas were wonderful as well, we had the grilled calamari and it was awesome! The Tostas are excellent too, the roasted pork loin with gruyere was unbelievable as were the duck and ham with brie
Be careful not to order too many though, save room for paella for sure
We had the seafood one, AMAZING
Make a reservation in advance, we didn't but the wait wasn't too bad at the bar
The sangria helped pass the time and the food was well worth the wait!!
FORGET THIS PLACE!!! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! You get better atmosphere at Bar Jamon and better food/prices at Bar Carerra
We had a 9:30pm reservation for two which stretched out to an hour wait
They then tried placing a table right in the front where everyone was coming in and out and where there were two very loud bachelorette groups
We could have just sat at the bar and ordered the food, which is what we did
When the food got arrived it was REALLY GREASY and nothing special at all
In fact the one dish we were looking for to was the steamed muscles, which never came out
It seems someone FORGOT THE ORDER
I AM NEVER AGAIN GOING BACK!!! IT SVCKED!!! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE and spend your money at tapas bars that are ten times better
If you do go be forewarned
I left a 80 cent tip on a $30 bill and I've never done that in my life before, I usually tip at least 30% if not more
NEVER EVER AGAIN!!! Now you know how this placed svcks a$$ so much! BE WARNED!!!
Happy hour at Sala is great
Drinks are great at 2 or 1 but don't be fooled, you only get your second drink free meaning, two people have 4 drinks for the price of two
A better drinking bargain in Chelsea, the crowd is filled with some young professionals but, mostly casual, laid-back people coming in for happy hour
Tapas and food are a bit expensive for Happy Hour but, hey, if you're tipsy over the strong drinks, you have to eat sometime
I have been to Sala a few times the food is average, the drinks are decent
However, here are the problems i had: -EVERY TIME - we were not seated on-time (had to wait almost ONE hour) -our waiter was nice but one of the hostesses/waitress was VERY, VERY RUDE
our table was overflowing of finished dishes and I had asked her politely if she can take a plate and she BARKED back -saying that its not her job/table
Honeslty- I don't care if its not ur table
U work at the resturant=its ur job
I tried to make a reservation at Sala One Nine for a group
The very friendly reservationist mistakenly thought that there was space open for us, and told me she'd call back to confirm
Instead, the owner called back
He accused me of lying to him when I said we had been told there was space open, and hung up on me!   The reservationist (who was never rude) called and apologized, but the owner (who was unbelievably rude) never did
I've heard that service is often surly at Sala One Nine and I'm not surprised, given the attitude of the management
If you make a reservation, be sure you have a backup plan!
My boyfriend took me here for the Sunday night all you can drink sangria and paella
We had so much fun we are thinking about coming here every Sunday with a group
We ended up ordering extra tapas and dessert which were delicious but my favorite is their awesome sangria
Not watered down at all!! Great value
Had an early dinner with a friend
We were seated promptly and treated like royalty
The food was delicious and the waitress was great! I can't wait to eat there again
I have been to numerous Spanish restaurants here in New York, and this one is truly the best

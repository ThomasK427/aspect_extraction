With so many great reviews, my friends and I were quite curious to try this unknown spot
We admit the food is very good, but the ambiance is just ok and service could be better (granted we came at their busiest time during pre-theater)
So Raku is not a 10 in our opinion but is a very good place for very good sushi
Sushi Excellent Service Very Friendly Cozy/Small Place Worth Checking Out!
Based on the citysearch reviews, I went to this restaurant expecting good food and was extremely dissappointed
The sushi was low-grade, for the sushi they used plain rice (not vinegar sushi rice), the soup was tepid
need I go on? On top of that, the manager admitted that he was listening in on our conversation
Who does that?  Please do not be mislead by the 44 other reviews
Isn't it interesting that there are so many reviews
especially since the restaurant has only been open for ONE month?
In the hustle and bustle that is Times Square, Raku was a welcome escape from the glitz and glitter
Three of us from the SF Bay Area all enjoyed the ambience and the food
Coming from the west coast, we were somewhat apprehensive about sushi in NYC, but were happily surprised
Furthermore, when there was a problem with my credit card, the owner took it upon himself to contact the credit card company and his bank to track down the source
He went above and beyond the call of duty and left a message on my cell phone later that evening describing what he had discovered
What else could you ask for?  Raku was truly a wonderful dining experience
My wife and I just moved in to the Biltmore from Hoboken in the summer, a great location in the Theater District
The food at Raku is simply excellent - we are amazed at the freshness of their sushi as well as their variety of choices on their menu
We regularly dine at Raku at least once a week or order in
We used to dine at Tomoe or Yama's downtown, but why wait in line for 1-2 hrs
when one can go to Raku and have little wait time
It's worth the subway or taxi ride!
The fish is very fresh
Staff is very friendly, service is very good
The ice cream tempura is a must try, so is that unique unfiltered nigori sake
Both are rare to find in the city
Though I wish some of the portions can be bigger
Our firm moved to midtown, and we went looking for a good neighborhood sushi restaurant, similar to one we used to eat at downtown
We found Ray and Raku! The sushi is fresh, lunchbox specials give you choices and there are interesting sushi rolls
Then Ray told us about unfiltered sake - wow - now that is good
Raku makes midtown feel like a small neighborhood - the staff is always happy to see us, and Ray always makes time to stop by your table and say hello
Great value and great food
It has become our friday lunch place
1st time we have tried the 'milky' sake was at Raku
What a delicious drink - nice alternative to hot dry sake
The sushi is impeccable
The white tuna and regular tuna fantastic
Spicy variety very tasty (yellowtail jalapeno and spicy sashimi salad another 1st for us)
Lobster variety good choices also
This is a very nice place with very nice people
Highly recommend Raku
We recently visited NYC and were looking for a Japenese restaurant with selection, location and value
Raku provided all of that
We had a great meal and service
The owner took the time to chat with us after and ensured we had a good time
Highly recommended and we will be coming back
Great location in the theatre district
I decided to carbo load saturday but sushi-load on friday
Just happened to walk by from the Hotel Edison
Fantastic joint - little small but the freshest sushi selections and special rolls (here's my carbs) were amazing! had to stay away from my fav tempura shrimp but white tuna, unagi, uni, salmon, spicy scallops were great stand-ins
Highly recommend - carbs or no carbs! good luck to all my fellow marathoners! will run my way back to Raku again!
Raku must be good to consistently receive so many great reviews
If not for Citysearch, we would have missed this place
We didn't see any celebs but we did see some damn good sushi
Coming from Astoria, trip is worth making
Starters: lobster miso, toro tartare, yellowtail jalapeno
Next: white, tri-color, lobster tempura, eel luxury rolls
Finale: Tempura ice cream, Asian pear delight
Asked Ray to add a black dragon roll (eel outside, shitake mushrooms gobs of orange tobiko inside)
Owner says he'll consider it
When you go, please add your vote! We're coming back real soon!
I have been eating sushi only for a couple of years (my parents love it but took me a while to even try it)
Now I love it especially yellowtail and unagi
There are so many sushi restaurants in NY that it is hard to pick out the best
But Raku has to rank very high in my eyes (and my tummy!)
My parents favor Tatany52 but since we were going to the theater, I checked out Citysearch and found Raku had very high ratings
We agree
Special rolls selections were great, lobster tempura roll and lobster miso soup were fabulous
And host suggested white tuna - now that is part of my favorites
We had a great time at Raku
Came here on business trip stayed at The W, checked out Citysearch for nearby sushi found Raku had highest rating, Blue Fin was rated quite low
Went to both anyway, Raku was by far the preferred choice
Blue Fin was overpriced, noisy service was not good
For fresh sushi other authentic Japanese food, Raku compares to my favorite Hana Sushi in Bothell, Wash
The specials rolls were excellent, the lobster miso soup yellowtail jalapeno never had before, highly recommend
Though the salmon was very good rich tasting, ours is better in the great Northwest! Will come back next time around!
What a pleasure it was to have great sushi and still catch the fish and see them beat the yanks! Sorry NY'ers, for the best fish it's the Marlins and for one of the best sushi it's Raku! The selections were so many, we couldn't decide what to start with since we wanted to go a local bar to catch the finale
But we had the Love Boat which was more than enough for us
Excellent quality and presentation
The hot and cold sake were also very good
A delightful place with excellent service
Looking for a pre-theater sushi place before going to see Jackie Mason's new show, we found Raku had the highest rating
All the reviews were very complimentary so we had to give it a try ourselves
Our 1st visit here was very satisfying
But, it takes a while to go through their extensive menu - being sushi lovers we were quite surprised by all the nice choices
The sashimi cucumber roll with spicy salmon (for those who are cutting rice out) and the lobster tempura and spider rolls were amazing
This will be our favorite mid-town spot, 2nd only to Tomoe!
This little restaurant is very nice
Our friends (7 of us) enjoyed the food, ambiance, friendly service, sushi chef and host
We were warmly welcomed and nice to know the owner had worked in Switzerland before and we could relate to his travels
The owner paid special attention to our 7mo
old daughter - he loves children
The sushi was excellent quality (we do not have many good sushi places in Zurich), bento boxes great value and sample of unfiltered sake was very good
We promise to tell our friends back home when they visit NY
vielen Dank messier Ray
Scott Foley, Robert Sean Leonard Mario Cantone! We were there wed
with Scott/Robert fri
nite with mario sat right across from them! We overheard the owner speaking with them they were so down to earth, unpretentious! They said they will be regulars cuz they love sushi Raku is so good

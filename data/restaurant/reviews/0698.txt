I'll be back again and again
Yes, we did have to wait a few minutes for a table, but it was worth it
The food is superb! We are continually looking for a great place to call home and this is it! Well thought out and executed dishes such as super crisp iceberg lettus with maytag blue cheese, simple, but very good
The lobster roll was full of meat and seasoned to perfection
My friends chicken plate was tender and flavorful, the mashed were to die for
We split sweets, toasted cranberry with pistachio ice cream and a awesome key lime pie
Going back real soon!!! PS, the room was beautiful!
I'm always on the lookout for new places that cater to someone that likes to enjoy a nice glass of wine, a pint, and a great sandwich
General Store has all three
It's a toss-up between the BLT and the meatloaf sandwich on the food side, but it's the sinner's cider that steals the show at the bar
Great food
Great spirits
Great place to go belly-up in the East Village
This is the best thing to come to this city since pizza! I'm a food person
I eat out at least three nights a week and I couldn't be more pleases with this hot spot
I had the most wonderful meals here
Brunch was a delight, the pancake, omlette and mimosa were so fresh
The dinner I had on another occasion was just as much a lovely experience
I had a General Store salad followed by a tender BBQ pork chop
The pancake mix I purchased in the retail area cooked up beautifully
The creme fraiche truffles melted in my mouth and the banana caramel bread pudding
I could go on all day!!! Service was very sweet and the atmosphere is warm and home spun
This is THE place!
The restaurant looks wonderful, I can't wait to stay and eat
I, however, only got some take out bakery items
The fresh cream truffles were the best I've ever had and I've had them all
The great line of jams and butters were a delight too
My sisters kids loved the lolly pops I bought them at this truely unique General Delight!
I visited General Store for brunch
The waiter was very pleasant
The pancake I ordered was slow to arrive and ice cold, but actually tasted good
A section on the side of the restaurant is set up like a little country store, except that the goods were not particularly unique or appetizing
General Store has a great concept, but it's not living up to its true potential
General Store is so warm, it's unusual (for the East Village, especially)
The smells from the wonderful desserts baking permeates the place, you can close your eyes and feel like you're at Grandmas
The comfort food menu (e
g
meatloaf sandwich, lobster roll) is consistently excellent
But, thank god, it's a sophisticated bar, too, with nice, inexpensive wines and a big selection of beers
I love that it's nonsmoking, too
Like I said, it's my new place
I'm a beer guy
This place has 12 real good beers on tap
I had a great pressed sandwich and a bowl of chowder with way too many of those real good beers, but it was completely worth it! I'm going to get a troup of us to come for a beer brunch this week
I'm so excited about this new place! The desserts were absolutely grand
The fresh chocolates were a pleasant surprise
We had a terrific bottle of wine with our dinner
The cod special was so tender, I wanted to order another just to keep tasting it
Can't wait to try brunch
We came in on a super cold evening, so it was a little cold
The manager did inform us that more effective heating was being installed
We were well warmed, however, by a terrific meal
Corn and crab chowder that could stand up to the best and a pot roast too good for words
Were very excited about this place
I can't wait to go back!
Wow! Is all I have to say about this neighborhood find! I'm so happy such a terrific place has moved into my neighborhood
I've been hitting this place since it opened only a month ago and it just keeps getting better
The menu is simple but VERY well done
Great cheese, wines and a lobster roll I can't stay away from
Try the banana caramel bread pudding!
Yes, it was a little cool but the very friendly wait person informed us that heaters had been ordered
Thefood was fantastic! The pork chop and the cod were perfect
The home made ice cream and the Key lime pie were the best in town
Nice selection of wines too
The room was very beautiful
Every one should try this new little gem
A group of us dined here on a Saturday night, around 8pm
There was only one other table occupied, but for whatever reason, they sat us next to the door so that during the whole evening, the wind chill forced us to eat dinner wearing our coats
Although the food was fine, the service was terrible
I only saw one waitress for the entire place, and small as it is, she only came to our table to take our order and take away plates, not once asking us if our food was to our liking
We would have stuck around for the desserts, but the service and heating issues were so bad that we wanted to leave ASAP
Repeat customers may be impossible
If you do return, make sure to dress in layers
I was excited to try General Store, but left disappointed
The disappointments were many, but in short: Despite that we were essentially the only customers in the restaurant at the time, they sat us right in front of the door on a night that was 32 degrees (some had to eat with coats on!)
Food did not arrive as described, and when asked, we were rudely told that what we had ordered was not available
Food arrived cold and at different times, was overcooked, greasy and tasteless We had to ask several times for items we had ordered
The Server could not have been more annoyed by our presence or disinterested in our needs
The Owner was aware of the situation and didn't take control at any point
The atmosphere and decor was quite charming, and the pastries look wonderful, however I would NOT reccommend this place to anyone!
Good beer, great food, excellent pastries, and a beautiful setting
Felt right at home
The meatloaf sandwich rocks
The all american wine list has a great selection
It just opened about a month ago, but it is already very popular day and night
The decor was probably the key to their success
It is very warm, homey, and inviting
The food is very good as well, but the best thing about them might be their sweets
As the name imply, they try to do it all: breakfast, dinner, cafe, pastry shop, and bar
One would think that this type of Jack-of-all-trades approach would not work well, but they seem to have pulled it off somehow, each element effectively complimenting one another
It is a dream scenario for most restaurants
In Short Enormous black-and-white photographs depicting the legendary coach's undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphin season line the mahogany walls
The menu, printed on an actual football, features typical steakhouse fare
Starters range from creamy spinach to Caesar salad to oysters Rockefeller
Cooked-to-order fish, such as salmon, snapper and even dolphin (get it?), are partnered with beurre blanc
Steaks, delivered with a ceremonial flashlight inspection, include a 24-ounce porterhouse, a Kansas City sirloin and a "Cowboy Rib-eye
"
Ok, it was a little odd to have them put an autographed football on our table with the list of beef written on it
Thankfully that was just for show :)
the reall menu's followed shortly there after

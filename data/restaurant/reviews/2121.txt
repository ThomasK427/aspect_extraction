Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you
The Scene The East River isn't the Seine, yet it still has a gritty appeal to patrons of this celebratory floating restaurant
Diners enter via a handsome bar/lounge, all sparkling brass and polished wood, then proceed to the window-wrapped main dining room with expansive views up and down the waterway
Service can be exceedingly slow, especially when packed with the inevitable birthday groups
The Food The lively New American menu changes with the seasons, but you can always start with exquisite oysters from the Northwest, Eastern Canada and Europe
Other notable starters are the plump, sweet crabcakes served with a crunchy daikon salad and the rich and chunky lobster bisque
Among main courses, a lobster-cilantro vinaigrette enlivens a tuna steak dusted with coriander, and simple sauteed Dover sole is flawless
If you want red meat, go with the roasted rack of lamb accompanied by a lovely smoked tomato jus
Had dinner there Saturday night and the experience was just average at best
They stated that there is a water view from every table, but since I am only 5 feet tall, I needed to strain my neck to enjoy the view
The service was very slow and the food was not worth the wait
I expected more for the amount of money I spent there
To be experienced at least once if you're in NYC
for god's sake
it's on the river
seems like a better brunch place than dinner
their filet mignon was prepared very well but lacked the flavor and savvy I generally require food at that price to have
bland cuisine prepared well means no next dinner visit
but certainly worthy of the easier brunch meal
friendly staff
nice interior
and well
did I mention the exterior view of East River
do visit if you've just moved to NYC
enjoy! Hope this has been helpful
The Maitre'd should really take a remedial class in Manners
My wife and I showed up on time for our reservation and were escorted into an almost empty dining room
and promptly seated at a bad table
When I asked for a better table the Maitre'd gruffly said, no
No explanation, no apology, just no
Even though the roof was leaking right behind my seat, this was the table I was to be seated at
I was amazed that six servers were on the floor, but none actually left the servers' station
When they finally came to the table to take our drink order, the server dutifully informed us that there are two types of champagne by the glass, good ($16
00 per glass) and bad ($8
00 per glass)
I don't go to expensive restaurants to be belittled by a server
Also, if you decide to go to the breakfast buffet for a second time, you have to bus your own table
No one cme by to clear my table or ask if I needed another drink until I took my dirty plate and placed it on the unoccupied table next to us
This is truly one of those restaurants where it's better to let it go out of business and wait for someone new to take over the space and provide great service
It was a bitter disappointment and I would have walked out if it weren't for the fact that my wife and I were celebrating
the only way to I got reasonably good service was by causing a scene
The breakfast buffet is what you'd expect at a Hyatt
Nothing over-the-top
Take my advice and pass
The decor is beautiful, but it isn't worth being treated like a second class citizen
Our service was horrible; our chicken was dry and fish was horribly prepared! I waited over 30 minutes for a glass of water! Needless to say my experience was less to be desired and wouldn't go back
I can get better food, service and a nicer view from a great place in NJ
I would NEVER go back!!!!
We've been here so many times
The view is spectacular, the food never disappointing, and the prix fixe lunch prices are fantastic
The staff there is the friendliest and most generous
I have been to this place numerous times
The food is mediocre
The views are nice, but from Brooklyn, Queens and NJ are much better
The prices for boiled stuff that anyone can make are outrageous
Go to any other seafood place and you will have a much better meal
The decidedly masculine-feeling nautical decor is a refreshing change from other restaurants that try ever so hard to be chic
The bar is quite comfortable and the piano music at night adds to the delightful ambience
Our favorites: the Calamari appetizer (which is never, ever chewy), and the crab-cake
For your main meal, try the glazed sea scallops with roasted citrus and mesclun greens, the Filet Mignon (with one of the most scrumptious treatment of potatoes we've had in New York), or the broiled Salmon
The lobster is good but over-priced; go for lunch and it's only $35 and served prixe-fix with all the trimmings
And the food is consistently good, every visit
Service isn't overly quick, but who cares with a lovely view of the river
We found every single employee to be friendly and helpful
A big plus for us is the free valet parking
This place was fine but considering its reputation and cost it was a disappointment
The food was quite awful - bland and overcooked
Tables were tiny and cramped
Service was pleasant but not outstanding
The view was average
I am not sure what the big fuss is about it being on the water; there was nothing to see
I would much rather go over to Brooklyn and eat a pizza on the waterfront or get a glass of champagne at the Rainbow Grill
Are New Yorkers so deprived of water that anything on the water is considered a great view? Perhaps it is because I am from the South Pacific were we have many much better (and cheaper) restaurants on the water
Overall I wouldn't recommend it
You will be disappointed and a whole lot poorer afterwards
The dining room was huge and spread out with floor to ceiling glass windows, gorgeous views of East River
The most breathtaking water views of any place I've been in Manhattan
I don't know why more restaurants are not on the water like this? I went at night and every table had long stem candles in candlesticks, very romantic
Menu was steaks and seafood, great wine selection with top vineyards
Good peoplewatching--lots of good looking couples
Professional waiters, coat check, great tasting gourmet food, and valet parking
I will go definately go back with a romantic date
Oh, there is also a lovely bar with fireplace as this place is two story and enormous in size
We have NO pictures of my daughter's 15th Birthday Party as the Captain did not allow her friends to take digital pictures
He allowed adults at other tables to stand up and take pictures but not my daugher's group of 18 well-mannered friends
The Captain arranged to have two tables put together so a party of adults could all be together
My daughter's group was not allowed to do the same
The 20% tip was mandatory and included in the bill despite the poor (surly) service from the one waiter assigned to the 2 tables
The view from the restaurant beside the east River is very nice
And I really appreciated their hospitality when I visited there
A good place to eat on the weekend on a nice sunny day
Good for couples, Food is just the right amount
Great service, Great meal, Great view  Why isn't there a link to the web site? Add it, you can see the restaurant's view from the web site

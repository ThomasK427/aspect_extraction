I was suprised when I ducked into this restaurant to get out of the rain
Vegetable samosas were cooked differently, and looked like balls of fried string onions/potatoes
Very filling, although it just tasted like fried onions
Chicken vindaloo and vegetable vindaloo were super spicy and delicious
Very large portions for a cheap price! Naan was good as well
Pappadam was too oily and stale
Free rice pudding and herbal tea was served at end of meal
Not the best Indian food, but pretty good for cheap Indian food!
Hands down the best Italian restaurant in America
Service with a smile doesn't even begin to describe the experience that awaits you at Grano
I really enjoyed this nice restaurant great frood and ambience slighlty price for the size of the portions but my husband and I really thought overall was acceptable
be back soon !
NOT your run of the mill, heaps of squishy pasta place
Really a wonderful find
Inventive, fresh food, fantastic service
Charming ambiance
Quiet, perfect for a conversation, but also for a group
From the moment you walk in to Grano Trattoria, you feel like you're in an Italian country home
the manager himself greeted us and served us( and it wasn't that crowded)
the salads and home made foccacia were delicious and the service was excellent
When I ordered the apple tart, they offered to go to the store to get more vanilla ice cream as they were out at the time
Instead my boyfriend and I decided to share the chocolate polenta( out of this world) we were given dessert and after dinner cocktails on the house
the evening was wonderful
I will definitely be back
a great date spot or place to bring your parents or anyone ele you actually want to be able to talk to
I went there last year, and being picky for fresh pasta, especially gnocchi, tried their gnocchetti with speck
Basically, it was so good I almost fell out of my chair
Eat here for some lovely flashbacks of the quality food you've eaten in Italy
Like so many others before us, we happened to spot this attractive little restaurant walking around the village
We found it to have wonderful ambiance, delicious pasta and desserts
Most importantly, the wait staff is friendly, courteous and attentive
I stumbled on this place on a rainy night looking for a good italian place to eat - boy am I glad we decided to go in
The pasta is amazing - as someone said in another review, this really may be the BEST italian food in NY
We didn't have reservations but it was early so I think we lucked out
Ambiance, service, food, wine - all fantastic and a great little date spot
This place had the friendliest service I've experienced in Manhattan
The food was very good and the prices were reasonable
A rare find!
This is the best Italian restaurant in NYC
The food is fantastic, the prices very reasonable and the staff is very courteous polite
The menu offers you a fantastic selection to choose from
I tip my hat to the owner, Mauritzio, you run a great ship, sir! He comes to your table to greet you and checks on your status fequently
If you do not eat at this restaurant, you are truly missing out on an awesome dining experience
Will go back severla times!! Keep up the GREAT work, Grano!!!
Grano is the best Italian food I've had in a long time
We always get great service and have wonderful food
I am at the point now where I don't even order off the menu, I just make suggestions to a type of meat and the rest is up to the chef
The lamb shank is to die for
The special pastas are always good and the Pizza is done the right way
We've had a party for 60 here once and it couldn't have gone better
We regularly sit down with between 2 to 10 and it is never a problem
The service is friendly, the prices are very reasonable
I wonder if sometimes the match between a diner and a cook's taste buds is simply a mis-match
If this is so, then Grano is for me
The food is absolutely delicious, although it is heavy so do not eat it too late
I leave the restaurant still licking my chops
Dessert is a definite end to the meal at this place
Wonderful location!!!
Grano is a must for those who want exceptional food, great service, excellent wine and a charming environment in which to dine
The owner of the restaurant even took time to sit with us and have a glass of grapa after dinner
The spinach salad with green apples and goat cheese is superb
I had a lamb and pasta dish, the special, and my friend had salmon; both were exceptionally flavorful and the portions are good
When dining here don't forget to finish your meal with grapa
Grano has an excellent selection
We find this restaurant to be a good standby in the village
It is truely a trattoria in the purest sense of the word
The wait staff is always very friendly and the service overall has been good
We go here often when we don't want to spend too much money and can't think of another place to go
Overall the food is very consistant and the basic Italian
I stumbled upon this place after being turned away at Babbo! What a find
The pasta is spectacular - served al dante in amazing sauce
The appetizers are great and make you want the main course even more
I highly recomend this place! Great atmosphere
Great food, great service - I've eaten here a million times and always loved everything I've tasted
if the specials include anything with a walnut sauce, order it - it is fantastic!!
Grano is not your typical Italian restaurant - the innovative food not only pleased our palates, it was visually tantalizing as well
The owner of the restaurant personally greets customers and makes everyone feel very welcome
I recommend the artichoke and octopus appetizers, and I highly recommend the dessert of the night -
Warm room, good food, can't complain about this place
Pastas are all excellent - not your standard fare - a little experimental
The pizzas, large enough to feed two, are delicious and the salads are wonderful, but main courses have always let me down
It's a large place, easy to get into and good enough if you're in the neighborhood
With a glass of pinot grigio, I'm always happy when I share a Margarita pizza (basil, tomato, etc
) and the Grano Salad, a tasty and large salad that includes beets, arugala and shaved cheese
This is where my husband and I take-out sushi and we'll miss it sorely when we move
Floyd is an extremely welcoming host and his sushi can't be beat for freshness, presentation and value
Out-of-town friends dined in the back party room and raved about it
Our big recommendation: The Dallas roll - YUM!
The food is amazing and the price is very reasonable
This nice cozy place serves fish comparable to the most expensive and well-known sushi places in the city with unbeatable prices and the friendliest environment
Do not hesitate to enjoy this place and when you go just ask Floy (the sushi Maestro) to take care of you
You won't be disappointed
The rolls are delicious, the atmosphere is great, the staff is nice, and the food is extremely reasonably price
I highly recommend it
It is also great for parties, as it has a karoake room in the back for 10-15 people
Not only is the atmoshpere second to none
The chef and owner creates a mood that should not be missed
The fish is alawys fresh and melts in your mouth
I went to this restaurant a couple of weeks back with 2 friends to celebrate my friend's birthday
As usual we ordered some sushi rolls and some appetizers from the kitchen

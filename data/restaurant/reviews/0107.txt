The place is huge, but it's always packed with people waiting to be seated because they made the mistake of not making a reservation! I've tried a number of their appetizers and I just LOVE their assortment of spring rolls
They also have very creative and delicious specials
The sushi selection is also very good
Be sure to try the fruit sushi roll with an assortment of kiwi and mango
You'll be pleasantly surprised
I would definitely go here again
I really like the food selection, and the decor is pretty cool
The prices aren't too bad either
Not exactly romantic or anything, but good food at a decent price--can't complain too much
I have been 2 times to Ruby foo's
The rolls were excellent
! Try the special ruby foo's cocktail
You might be pretty dizzy after 2 or 3 of those babies
Ask for the chocolat cake as a dessert
it is huge! A place I will definitly recommend
whenever I'm in NYC, I'll stop by Ruby Foo's in Times Square
they have good sushi and other great menu items
plus sake
I'm not a sushi snob like a lot of NYC'ers so sorry if Ruby's isn't the greatest place ever created
but thats ok b/c it's mostly a tourist crowd anyway, and I like it
so everything is hunky doory
I always go here with a big pack of friends and we share everything and have a blast
I've never had any problems with the staff and the food is good
not excellent but delicious
So it may not be super-authentic -- that's not the point
Ruby Foo's offeres consistently tasty, well-presented dishes in a laid-back, pan-Asian chic atmosphere
Great for apres-theatre or for drinks and apps with the girls
The Scene This six-room extravaganza, replete with large bar and balcony perched beneath a 20-foot ceiling, attracts business people on lingering lunch breaks, trussed-up theater-goers and couples of all ages
The pop music and lofty spaces are a little incongruous with the Tuscan country fairy-tale decor
Evening service--featuring waiters all in black--is a little slow; plan on a leisurely dinner unless you're headed for the theater
The Food Homemade pizzas and pastas do brisk business
The first are an original product: oblong slabs of thin crust, grilled to a charry crisp; be minimalist when ordering, though, as heavy toppings tend to overwhelm
Pastas are generally good, especially a weightless ditali (thimble-sized tubes) with lentils and its polar opposite--pappardelle with tender veal ragu
Striped sea bass is tasty and well-seasoned, there's also duck panini and polenta flan on a bed of duck ragu
What a meal
absolutely the best shortrib i've ever had in my life and the biggest!!!
my dinner was better than expected, my friends brought us in and boy what a surprise esp
after reading the earlier reviews and service was awesome
get a life
The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing
The menu is nothing like the one on the website
The food was so-so
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished
Has the chef and owner changed???
Great restaurant! Don't let those reviews discourage you from trying one of the best italian places to eat and enjoy atmosfere
Some people that go to restaurants just have an attitude and complain about everything sit down and enjoy the delicious meal
(but note you should do something about the servers flirting with the hostesses
After reading the reviews for Scopa online and reading the menu on their web site
Scopa looked as though it would be a great place for dinner on a Saturday night
I was wrong
The food was just OK, at least for what food was available
For some reason, all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon
Something about them being busy with holiday party's
The food was just OK, I would never go back
I had been to Scopa for happy hour and some amazing private parties- but had never been there for dinner
I was seated in the Venice Room decorated with the tapestries and chandeliers
The ceilings are so high and all of the artwork sets a very romantic and warm mood
The menu was huge! and the winelist- unbelievable! I reccommend the Calamari Fritti and the Pan-Seared Scallops to start
Very fresh and delicious sea food
For dinner, their pasta is a must! Cooked to order with whatever I wanted- Scopa accomodated my every wish! For dessert: Tiramasu [what else!?] Scopa is a wonderful dining experience from start to finish
And if you are just looking for happy hour fun- I highly reccommend it! I met my boyfriend of a year there!
My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I couldn't believe the food
Every course was better than the next
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster, a cold lobster salad that was magnificent
I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food
came here for restaurant week, didn't save much, but it was still great
service was absolutely superb, ambiance/atmosphere was amazing, young-older crowd on weeknights, laid back lounge/bar
the food wasn't 100%, altho there was the one appetizer we liked and the gelato which was good
it's a huge place-best for renting out for big parties/gatherings
i would go again if i didn't have to pay
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town
The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened
The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour)
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!
The food was absolutely amazing!! The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!! The lamb was tender so full of flavor, the dessert was divine!! The waiter was attentive
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening
This particular locale, while having food identical in quality to the other Burritovilles in town, has terrible seating accomodations
Not enough space for the lunch crowd, constant deliveries going through the front door TERRIBLE heating/ac control
In the winter cold air blasts right in
get it to go if you can return to a place that's sheltered
The Scene The stylish, starkly designed space has a vaguely cinematic theme
Expanses of black wood, white screens and oversized tables give it a comfortable modern feel
Service is friendly, hip and understated, quite suited to the sleek downtown crowd
Extras, like a film series, DJs and occasional celebrity sightings, keep the atmosphere dynamic
The Food The Korean dishes here are a bit more delicate than the potent fare found 30 blocks north, but the kitchen is hardly pulling its punches
Fresh green chile peppers stuffed with seasoned ground beef make a bold, delicious starter, as do a variety of pajun pancakes filled with seafood, kimchi or pungent shiso leaves
A handful of tables have built-in gas grills; diners who request one can enjoy a choice of grill-it-yourself entrees for two, such as marinated rib-eye, pork, mixed seafood and more
Also excellent are the house japchae--glass noodles with dark sesame sauce and chicken or beef
Do Hwa is a great restaurant
Great food, atmosphere, and service
I have been here on numerous occasions and know for a fact that it would provide the ideal setting for students from a top 4
5 law school that are looking to let their hair down and celebrate the completion of their 1L year
It is also particularly amusing to tell people where you are going
When you say Do Hwa try putting the emphasis on the Hw in Hwa and say it like you are kung-fu-chopping someone
Great fun every time, just ask my main man Chuck
The only problem is that coming up with a pun that incorporates the restaurant's name is harder than completing an evil puzzle on websudoku
com
Even with my expectations set so high this place delivered
I went to Do Hwa to celebrate my Mom's birthday with a large group

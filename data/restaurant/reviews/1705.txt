Specials, like pepper-seared bonita draped over seaweed and red onion, are more creative compositions
Stick to the menu and you'll find overcooked edamame, fall-apart spider rolls with greasy soft-shell crabs, bready barbecue meatball skewers and bland bowls of udon
Second to Yama, this is my favorite sushi destination
Although the atmosphere isn't chic or romantic, the food here is great and so is the value
I don't always enjoy spending $100/person for a good sushi meal when I can spend $40/person at Takahatchi
The sushi has always been extremely fresh and tasty
The chilean sea bass appetizer melts in your mouth
Try the fried soft shell crabs also
Add in some sake and you've got the perfect meal
I've never had to wait for a seat and I hope it stays this way!
I grew up in Japan eating sushi all my life and I love takahachi
Their food is always freshly prepared and delicious
Their White Tuna sashimi is superb - it just melt in your mouth
Ambience is not the best, but who cares when you have a great tasting sushi in front of you?
I think Takahachi is great
I've only been there once and got three rolls
spicy tuna (which was actually spicy and was very tasty), eel avocado (which was great), and the rainbow (which was massive, with yellowtail in the middle and huge pieces of fish around the rice)
The rolls were a great deal and were fresh and good
highly recommended
Not bad- but would visit a couple other exceptional places in the hood first
They would be 6 or 7th on my list for sushi
Actually, it seemed like each dish had some kinda drawback
Like the spicy tuna hand rolls were good, but just too chunky and the teriyaki tofu appetizer is good, but bad aftertaste- I dunno, there are so many better places- would prolly not go back
Everytime I want sushi I come here, at least once a week
Their dishes have creativity that most places never have and the service is personal and great
The Scene This bar and restaurant occupies two rooms: a small square barroom has earthen floor tiles, burnt-orange walls, and a wine-glass cabinet made of multi-colored panes; a second room is painted entirely turquoise and filled with dark-wood tables and chairs
Both are lit by ornate sconces and the tables' white candles
The Food Along with pan-Latin cuisine, you can order Cuban and Brazilian cocktails, creamy batidas and red wines from Chile and Argentina
The restaurant plays a largely old-school Brazilian and Latin jazz soundtrack--this feels like a relaxed departure from the city's brisk pace
The East Village crowd varies in age, and some couples are open to an impromptu cha-cha by the bar
Though the far east location might deter some, it's hard to imagine this place retaining the same soft charm anywhere else
I loved the chocolate volcano
A bit too cozy
my elbow was rubbing up against the person of the next table
A bit on the salty side, but overall a fun place with great festive ambiance
Great date spot, excellent spot to take out-of-towners and friends
Even with reservations you will wait for a table but it's fine because the bar makes excellent mojitos to help pass the time nicely
The food here is delicious but forego the steak because it's average
Also, beware, while it can be inexpensive, the bill adds up fast
Dining outside makes it a great balmy summernight dinner option
I have been going here for a few years now
I like the vibe, food music
Service is just ok, nice but ok
Perhaps its the brazilian way of life to chill and be laid back
(ps I dont go here for the service)  I dig the kiwi caipirinha and the coconut drink
The chayote salad is refreshing
The Feijoda is tasty, like I remember from brazil
Hearts of Palm dish with shrimp was great too
Empanadas Salmon entree were ok
Keep up the good work
I just went to Esperanto on a friend's restaurant for my birthday, and it was definitely worth the trip! They sat us promptly on our reservation, and the waitress was very attentive and quick with our orders
The food was delicious, and we were mostly drinking mojitos which were also perfect
There was a band playing great latin music, and that made the atmosphere really fun
All in all it made for a great dinner, and now that I've been there I'm definitely heading back soon
This place left a bad taste in my mouth before I even ate there
It began when I requested an 8pm reservation and was rudely declined due to their preference to walk in's policy
We ask to order appetizers but they insist we need to order our entrees at the same time, and dessert as the dessert takes a while to cook
We advised the waitress, our  friend would be arriving momentarily to order
When my friend arrived, not more than 2 minutes later, she was advised she could only order a few things off the menu that wont take long to cook
And the most shocking of  all, if she wanted steak it would have to be cooked rare, as they dont have time
That is the epitome of bad service
i am appalled
I use to live in the East Village and wish I still did! Esperanto was the perfect option for my friend's birthday
it was very reasonable priced and the food was great! I love Latin flavors as well as the mojitos and caipirinhas
Esperanto nails both
highly recommend Esperanto and then hit all the other bars on Avenue C for a fun night out!!!
A friend of mine and I just went there first time last weekend for a birthday dinner, and we had a such a great time that I'm sure we'll be back soon! The food we ate was delicious (we shared the chayote salad and I had a tuna steak) but on top of that although the place was busy with a lively fun crowd the service was friendly and prompt
They have live bands on the weekdays, so we may try coming back on a weekday to check that out!  Highly recommended!
Esperanto is one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had
The manager and waitstaff were extremely rude
Although there were many open tables, the manager insisted my party wait at the bar for over one hour
It is clear he only made us (and the numeruos patrons at the bar) wait in order to increase the bar tab
When we asked when our table would be ready, he told US we were out of line
No restaurant should treat its customers in this manner
Esperanto is RUDE -- from the managers on down
I have never experience ruder service
Basically, they could care less if you stay or go
And don't trust them when they say it's a two hour wait
They're just trying to mess with your head
In reality, they'd rather hold a table empty for hours rather than give you the satisfication of spending money at their establishment
(There's no logic to their customer philosophy
)  Do not go
You can get the same kind of food at some other restaurant -- and at the same time be treated like a human being
Imagine that?
It seems that I can't get this restaurant out of my mind
Anytime I go on a dat eI find myself bringing people to this spot
I also tend to crave their plantain crusted goat cheese almost every other day
This restaurant is a must
Great drinks, great music and ambiance
Esperanto is always great! The calamari salad and coco punch are especially good
Dinner there has been great every time we've been there, and the live music has always made the ambience really fun
Service has also always been quick and professional -- Go there, you won't be disappointed
I went here for my weekly girls' night out
The rude woman at the door said we could not be seated until our last friend arrived even though she was running really late and told us to start w/o her
Finally after a round of drinks at the bar and several rounds of asking to be seated
we were sat, and then not 30 seconds later the same woman came over and asked if we'd mind moving to the front, where the band was setting up
we said YES we did mind, since we were there to chat
Luckily at that moment our last friend arrived and we were able to start what ended up being a delicious dinner with spotty service
We shared a bunch of apps, sandwiches, seafood, and dessert and it was all unique and tasty!
We've gone to Esperanto several times now, and it really has been a great time each time

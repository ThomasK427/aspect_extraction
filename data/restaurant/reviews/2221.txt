Employees were swearing loudly in the kitchen during our meal, and there were stacks of Krispy Kreme donuts, rolls, and plastic plates stacked on surrounding tables
Food was mediocre at best
this place was not good

mushy sauces 2
it shares with a sushi bar and smells of bad sushi 3
the service lacked any proper protocol 4
i can get better prepared vegetarian protein dishes and vegan cuisine at a koren deli
or and chinese restaurant,,
period!
Kind service, decent sake, and a huge array of creative and tasty meatless comfort foods! I'd love to go again
The create-your-own dish where you pick out two seleections is a great way to try different things when you can't commit
Restaurant is right by the Belvedere Hotel (and is actually on quiet 48th St) and Restaurant Row and seems to be combined with another Japanese restaurant called Asahi
Very affordable and cozy
Great place to find a healthy hangover fix and a great place to order delivery for lunch
The prices are so reasonable and the service is decent as well
I'm not even a veg and I like this place!
My boyfriend and I ate at Zenith before seeing a show at the Neil Simon Theatre
I really didn't have a problem with the service, although due to a little confusion, we were seated in the front area, rather than the rear vegetarian place
Still, we had a very nice meal
I really like the feature that lets you pick two uniquely named dishes to try
The Vegetarian Quilts--tofu leaves wrapped around shredded vegetables--were divine, as was Succulent Paradise, their name for soy chunks in barbecue sauce
The shiitake mushroom was a little bland, so pick something exciting to go with it
This place is so so over rated
The booze is flat and the food only average
Honestly, you should expect more from New York
I don't recommend thia place
This place has the best bartenders in the city
They are attentive and they actually buy you drinks
In NYC, this is a dying practice
The drinks are cheap, the place is cozy, and serves as an oasis in the land of theme bars and expensive hotel bars that dot the Times Square landscape
A true gem, and its right around the block from my office
Pat and Al gave as good as they got
I love a drink and they know how to keep the glass full
I'm now back in Eng but i still call it my local pub
loads of tasty birds on a friday night, looking for a nice man to take there stress away from a hard weeks work
Cheers love Si
In response to the guest who complained aobut a 6:30 reservation not getting them to the theater on time, I would suggest simply having dinner at 6
The service at Playwright Tavern is efficient and friendly
The food and prices are good
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place if you are dining before a theater performance
We made a reservation for 6:30, but did not get seated until 7 pm
We then waited until 7:35 before any food arrived at our table, despite the fact that we kept reminding our waitress that we needed to leave by 7:45
The only answer we got was don't worry
The service, ambience and food is disappointing
With all the other choices in Times Square, we recommend that you not make the mistake we made
I've eaten at the Playwright's Tavern 5 times
The food there is absolutely wonderul (although a little pricey), and the wait staff is very friendly (most are international and aspiring actors/actresses)
It is definitely a place to eat before/after a show or formal event
I've recommended it to many friends, and they have all been satisfied
Also- there is another Playwright - Act II - on 8th Ave if the Times Square location is full!
Cheers for The Playwright Tavern! As a visitor to NYC, myself and 2 friends stumbled on this charming neighborhood establishment our first night in town
Ray Quinlan was tending bar and was absolutely wonderful, although we strolled in there very late in the evening (too late to dine)
He made a very good margarita, chatted with us, introduced us to others at the bar, and made us feel welcome and comfortable
The decor is nice, dark and cozy
Our only regret was that we didn't have time to return - but we plan to on our next trip in December
Great location for after the theatre
The Scene The name means "my little nest," and it's appropriate: the setting is cozy, with a small bar area in the front and tables in the back
Paintings and arty sconces spruce up the amber walls a bit, but by and large the decor is minimal
Service is quick and warm, though occasionally harried
The clientele is businesslike at lunch, and more neighborhoody at dinner
The Food Mi Nidito's menu offers a considerable array of Mexican standards, with a separate page for seafood, such as King crab enchiladas, and another for vegetarian dishes such as almond-sauteed vegetables
Everything tastes super fresh: vegetable quesadilla, thick with fresh spinach, mushrooms and cheese, arrives with homemade guacamole; ribeye fajitas are nicely charred; and chimichanga filled with shrimp, scallops and lobster is rich as can be
The sopaipillas--honey-drenched pastry pillows served with housemade mango ice cream--are a treat
The strawberry frozen margaritas are the best - real strawberries
The food is always fresh and tasty
It's sometimes a bit loud, but is a reliable place for a good meal
In the winter, the taco soup is the best - pretty spicy, with lots of veggies
As good or better than what Mom made
MiNiditos is the best place to get a Marguarita
It is smooth and strong
I have been going to MiNiditos for at least 10 years recommending it to my friends, especially woman friends, as a place you can go alone or with friends to relax and enjoy a healthful Mexican menu with the freshest ingrediants and the best Marguarity you will find in many states
Worst customer service (i
e
management) ever
Although the food wasn't bad, the service was so horrible, that I didn't even get to finish half of my lunch because the waitress never came back to my table after serving me
Ran out of tortillas for fajitas and couldn't get anyone's attention to come back to my table
Also never received one refill for my drink
Finally had to leave my table (in very cramped quarters) to flag down the bartender
By this time, my food was cold
Only ONE waitress was on staff for the rush lunch hour
To make matters worse, the assistant manager said she could only take $2 off my fajitas (priced at $16) that I had not even eaten half of
Had the nerve to tell me I should have gotten up from my table to find someone to serve me
TERRIBLE experience
This was the worst experience that I have ever had eating dinner
The service sucked
The ladies were more worried about talking to themselves then waiting on us
The food was undercooked and was skimpy compared to the over prices on everything
I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy
Chevys on 42nd street was the best experience I had this weekend in New York
Check that one out if you want true Mexican food in a true mexican atmosphere
Can't believe I have worked only one block from this gem for the past 3 years and never noticed it! I did a Citysearch check last night for a last minute meal for two, and saw this high rating, so we went to check it out
WOW! The food, service and atmosphere are perfect
great casual mexican! Be sure you arrive hungry
portions are generous
All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty
We shared the double layer seafood quesadilla as an appetizer
yum! The fajitas and burritos were delicious
along with the chunky homemade guac!
last month, I had my 30th birthday party here with 10 guests

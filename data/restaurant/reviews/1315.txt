Just expect to wait a good twenty minutes before they take your order (even when the restaurant is half empty), you'll have to ask at least 5 waiters and a manager for coffee before they bring it to you and when they bring your orders out wrong, expect the manager to side with the chef and not you
We expessed our disappointment to our waiter and the manager nicely but all they could do is roll their eyes and walk away
I understand that working in a restaurant is tough but there is no need to be rude, pompous and smug
While dining with our infant son at around 6:30 p
m
, the customer at the table next to ours (who had just seated himself and was only drinking, not eating) began smoking in an area not designated for smoking
He refused to extinguish his cigarette
We informed the hostess of the problem and she rudely refused to remedy the situation, apparently because he was a friend of hers
The waitress also did nothing to remedy the situation
Excellent food, atomosphere, and staff
Me and my friends had a wonderful time her
The food was fresh, presented very nicely, and very good
We are all looking forward to getting back very soon
Delicious fares, friendly atmosphere, spacious sunny terrace
Every time we go there we have a pleasant experience
It is a comfortable restaurant with good classic French fare
The decor is beautiful and the staff accomodating
we went a group of 8 and it was great! seated immediately and the meal was delicious!
I've been to this restaurant a few times and have enjoyed it EVERY TIME
I love the sunny decor- I had the scallops which were DIVINE and also the chocolate cake for desert- Both were excellent
Great new addition to the neighborhood!
Went here for brunch
Host asked other waiter if we should be seated inside or outside but never asked us
Had to ask twice for coffee - better than lady to our left who had to ask FOUR TIMES
Very slow service and extremely loud in there esp
considering there were only 5 tables filled
Waiter had to lean on my husband to give people next to us their food
We had to ask 3 times to get our check
The food was good but at some point you're paying for more than just the food
I eat out for every meal in Manhattan and I've never heard more simultaneous complaining within one restaurant
2 servers for a packed brunch = 15 minute wait for water/bread, 25 minutes for 2 glasses of wine to arrive, the meal arrives in ok time except for the fact that we ordered an appetizer which doesn't show up until the end
Man, this is why I brunch below 14th st
The service is just awful at this place, although it looks like it would be great from the outside
:(
Had their shell steak and fries which were pretty good
I ate at the bar with my sister and the bartender was an absolute doll
Very attentive even during the busy dinner hour
Didn't like my sister's pasta dish-- porcini and pancetta strozapretti
I head read the previous reviews that said how the service was rude and how people were not allowed to go in wearing flip-flops
I went last night with flip-flops on and I had no problems getting in
Wasn't too busy when we got there (8ish) so they asked us where we wanted to be seated which was nice
Service was friendly and the hostess even came by to explain things on the menu
The Chicken Tagine is decent, chicken wasn't dry at all
Although i'm wasn't too crazy about their cous-cous
My friend got the Zatta Salmon and he liked it
grilled seasoned salmon that came out on a bed of grilled veggies
The interior has nice light fixtures and the whole area is dimly lit so it can be a romantic setting
Overall, a great place to try something new and also a nice place to meet up with friends
Casbah Rouge was an unexpected treat for a random Wednesday night outing
Fun music ( dancing), laidback people, cheap beers ($5)
I'd definitely go back
The space is large and would actually accomodate a private party nicely
A friend and I went here after a concert and found that the Gyspie Kings were playing
The menue was Prix Fixe, somewhere around $50 and we decided to go for it
After being seated, we waited a long time to be served
The appetizers were decent, but we waited probably about 45 minutes for the main course
I sent back my salmon 3 times for being undercooked
The wait staff was unattentive
The last time I sent back my plate, I told them I didn't want it any more
I asked for a free hookah instead, and they accommodated -- In sum, the ambiance and the music were great, but as far as food and service are concerned, this place is below par
I will never go back to this place
At first I liked going there because of the hookah and interesting drinks but the other night was a DISASTER! First, they wouldn't allow my very well dressed male friends in (it was about 60 degrees outside) because of a new no flip-flops rule and THEN after we came back, they said I couldn't come in because I was too drunk! (I had had one drink and was actually just excitedly talking to my friend
can we say misogyny?) They finally let us in where we got to experience really RUDE bartenders and mean staff
DO NOT GO HERE!!! (go to one of the many bars near by that realize they are in morningside heights and are chill and friendly)
A group of us went here for our friends birthday and had a fantastic time
The food was good, the service was friendly and the live music and belly dancer were great
The drinks are a little expensive but they make a good mojito and the after-dinner hooka was fun
over priced/mediorce food
poor servive
thought at first it has potential but not now
yeah it's kinda far away if you don't live in the columbia area but it is def
worth it
on saturday nights the music is BUMPING
great variety of hip hop, reggaton, international, 80's
sit, chill, drink and smoke hookah and/or dance in the back
also, the men's urinal is a third-world style communal basin
kinda cool but kinda weird when other dudes are in there
I've been to Curly's twice and have loved their meals
The first time was take out - the Veggie Buffalo Chicken wings (not their actual naming) was great
I had the Veggie Tuna Melt last time and it was past delectable
Hmmm, I may head to Curly's today
my fiancee and I love Curly's for brunch
The waitstaff is wonderful, the coffee is strong
I love the salads, and she loves the eggs
We come here weekly for brunch, and have firmly sealed it in our minds as the best place in the neighborhood
This place is great! The inside is very casual - a great place for a weeknight dinner that is really tasty and not too expensive
I went and had the veggie meatloaf and it was fantastic! Our bill ended up being less than $30 including tip
It's a good place to dine in a pair as the seating is mostly small booths for two
The 20 Ingredient salad and the Chili were great
Finding a Vegetarian place in New York that is reasonably priced is next to impossible, so you are looking at a gem right here
First, the food is good, not great, but satisfying
In a neighborhood long in need for a red sauce place, the service needs great improvement
Taking a drink order during dinner when the restaurant is half full should not take more than 20 minutes
Taking the food order should occur in a timely fashion, and check on levels of drinks to fill another order
I have visited this place over ten times and three times they have gotten an entree order wrong
In correcting the entree, it comes out in record time, which makes one wonder
Get your food to go or deilvered, but these rookie waiters need huge training in customer service
EXCELLENT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE BEAUTIFUL DECOR I HIGHLYRECOMEND IT
WILL BE A REGULAR
The food is AMAZING better than any downtown restaurant

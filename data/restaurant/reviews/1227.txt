I highly recommend this place
i stumbled upon SuRa last week and have already eaten there twice
the service is almost too good (!)
the yummy food is beautifully presented AND plentiful
the decor is warm
music ranged from guitar tango to glenn gould's bach variations
i've never written one of these reviews before, but i felt compelled since business still seems slow for them
it's really too good to pass up if you like korean food
try it out -- you'll see!
As a Korean myself, I would recommend this place to Koreans and non-Koreans alike
My husband and I would recommend the pear salad, the kimchee jun and the spicy barbeque pork (which isn't spicy at all)
The food was excellent (even the complimentary barbeque pork sandwiched b/w two slices of asian pear), the ambience is very simple yet elegant and the service was great
I really hope business picks up for these guys, although the benefit of it is we can go there more regulary without waiting
This undiscovered cozy Korean restaturant is amazing!~ They provide affordable lunch specials with high quality food and excellent healthy dinner menu!! They also have infused soju with different fruits
Service was very attentive
It hasn't been discovered yet by foodies so go and savor while you can get in
I pass by SuRa often, but it wasn't until recently that I actually went inside
You see, there's almost never anyone there
But the Zagat rating and the beautiful interior caught my eye
The food was delicious! I highly recommend the Asian pear salad, kimchi, the Japche (cold vermicelli noodles) and the battered shrimp
(They offer lunch specials and discounts for college students!) While the price was a little high, the presentation and the quality of thought really make SuRa worth it
Don't be fooled by the fusion title though, the food is ethnically very Korean but with very modern French presentation
The service is SUPERB! Even though our waiter was three days out of Korea, he was cordial, sweet, helpful and spoke good english
The chef was also kind- we received a complementary appetizer with our meal
Do try it before other people find out how wonderful it is!
Walked by, and a sign caught my eye (Top places to eat according to Time Out New York), so we tried it
Food was fantastic, and service was excellent
Definitely a hidden find
Try it !!!
and from the few times I've been there since my girlfriend and I happened upon it, it doesn't appear that it's been discovered by that many village residents
You should check it out while they're still trying to get established -- I don't know if this practice will change if business picks up, but everytime we've gone, the waiters come around with a bonus gift appetizer/treat from the chef
It's really fantastic! We can specifically recommend the bim bam ba (sp?) in the stone pot, and the shitake pancake appetizer
Well, it's an amazing korean restaurant
The food is excellent, the service is great and it just feels very good to be there! Plus it's a very good deal
Once you've been there you just keep going back
AMAZING!!! I went here a few nights ago and was blown away by the food, the ambience, the service
It was all wonderful
When you go, try the Spinach and corn congee and the delicious vegetarian meat balls
They provide many options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike
I would recommend this restaurant to ANYONE!
I had dinner at Lisca last weekend and was so impressed with the quality of food
Appetizers we had: roasted beet salad, the buffalo mozzarella, and the spicy mussels
all were outstanding
Entrees: pasta special with crab meat, the pesto pasta with manila clams, and the mixed seafood grill
I couldn't get over how entree seemed better than the next
We ended the meal with the raspberry tart and one of the best creme brulees I've ever had
The speed of the service needs to improve a bit, but overall was satisfied
I loved that it was a family run restaurant as well
This is our new favorite local place
my wife and i recently ate at lisca and had a tremendous experience
we were taken care of from the moment we entered the door
from the gentleman (hadi, the owner, it turns out)who escorted us to our table to the waitstaff who made sure our every need was attended to, we were treated like royalty
the food was outstanding
the atmosphere was warm and inviting
this was truly a memorable evening
we look forward to our next visit
My wife and I are regulars at Lisca, its a very good, neighborhood restaurant
Haddie, the owner, is tremendous
He remembers you every time, and he makes you feel like you are eating at a family restaurant
The funghi fritti is a must
The osso bucco with risoto has been done perfectly every time I've ordered it
The wait staff is exceedingly friendly
I marked the restaurant down as romantic, a good place for kids, and a good place for large groups only because I've seen Haddie go to great lengths in all three situations
If you want good food, at a reasonable price, with really stellar service, you can't go wrong with Lisca
Plus, even if you do not have reservations, Haddie will make every effort to seat you, and if he can't right away, he'll seat you at the bar where his daughter runs a very friendly bar
I love this place, primarily because the city has a shortage of vegan-friendly restuarants I can feel comfortable going to alone when I'm out running errands or shopping
It's just less awkward (and pricey) to go somewhere where you just order and seat yourself
My meat-eater boyfriend is also fond of it
My favorites are the reuben sandwich and the vegan cupcakes
The sides of roasted broccoli ae also delicious
I'd say the prcies are pretty normal for the city, $7 for a wrap or sandwich, which somes with a little side salad of good greens and sliced carrots
Though the milk-less shakes are a bit pricey at $5, the mocha espresso shake is still and irristible to-go item on a hot day
I was surprised by all the bad reviews I've read
I've been here for lunch three or four times, and had a good experience every time
There's plenty of seating, a sizeable veggie food menu, and I didn't think the staff were rude (or surly) at all
At least once, an employee brought my food to my table with a smile and extra napkins
:) (I think to expect more than a glare and your change back in this city is a little ridiculous anyway, but that's another story)
Prices could be better, but they're average for the location and fare, they've got to pay the (no doubt insane) rent, and I'm happy to support veggie establishments
I only wish they were open in the evenings
:\  Try the vegetarian souvlaki - it's delish!
Well once again, what was once the sweet west village has been taken over by post-corporate sell outs attempting to run a business
Food is sugary and fat-laden, staff are insecure by the beautiful people (ie
rude) and as noted no outlets
Unfortunately the crowds are no better
What a waste of a once neighborhoody lumber spot
I say turn it into a citibank
In response to the previous review: there are signs on the tables each weekend requesting that you use your computer at the community table (if you had bothered to read the signs you would have known this)
Since the computer users often stay for hours, it is a perfectly reasonable request especially since this is a restaurant which pays its bills based on the volume of food sales
I can understand why the owner (yes, he's a friend of mine) would be stressed to see potential customers leave because they can't find a seat
You should try hanging out at the local library--no one there will bother you
I had a run-in with the owner of this establishment one Sunday afternoon when he requested that I pick up my things and move to the community table so that a couple could have a seat
It wasn't exactly his words, but the tone with which he spoke that exemplified poor taste and plain old bad manners
Indeed, he seemed very nervous and stressed out - and I understand that everyone can have a bad day - but this one felt a need to be confrontational
I had just discovered this place down the block several weeks ago and put in at least $100 a week since then - my dollars are going elsewhere
It's too bad because 'snice is such a charming place
In these times of crazy mass exodus of independent coffee shops, this is a one of a kind cafe in NYC: veggie food + coffee+ wifi + friendly staff for an affordable price
My favorite plate is the smoked tempe wrap with avocado, and I am obsessed with the vegan cupcakes
Who would've thought vegan treats could taste so amazing? The staff is always friendly and some of them even remember my orders, even if I haven't been in for weeks
Sometimes its hard to get a seat
Every time I go to 'Snice, I tell myself it's the last time

The food was average for a brunch joint
My girlfriend's omelette was fine if a bit gooey, and my oatmeal was also fine, except that the strawberries that they put on top were not de-stemmed
Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but try de-stemming a strawberry in a bowl of oatmeal without using your hands -- it's impossible
The service was utterly abysmal
Our coffee and water were never refilled, our food came out 10 minutes apart (!), we were not given bread though the couple next to us was, we asked twice for our check and when it came, they forced us to pay the tip in cash so they could get out of paying taxes! Needless to say, we are never going back
First, my omelette came to the table
Ten minutes later, my dining partner's meal still wasn't on the table
I took a bite of the omelette
It had the wrong ingredients in it
I sent it back -- and five minutes later, the correct omelette was on the table
Alas, my dining partner's meal still wasn't to be seen (neither was the waitress)
We asked about it, and 10 minutes later, his oatmeal showed up
At this point, I asked for a coffee water refill, too, since our cups had been empty since BEFORE the first omelette made its appearance
Once we'd finished eating, it was another 15 minutes before we saw someone who would bring us the check - and after running my credit card, the waitress had the audacity to write cash only in the tip portion of the receipt!  Judge for yourselves, but be warned
The food and pastries in this place are amazing
Come hungry!
The Scene This vast, incredibly popular Flatiron super-bakery is the sort of institution where people have no shame about approaching you to ask, "Are you leaving soon?" Sunday morning brunches are as crowded as an uptown 6 train during rush hour: a mad jumble of Prada bags, baby strollers and fierce body-to-body jockeying for open seats
An observant few find refuge on a balcony at the room's rear
The Food For its baked goods alone--the wonderfully salty, soft-on-the-inside pretzel croissants, the moist cheese Danishes, the textbook lemon and chocolate tarts--City Bakery would be worth a trip
But what puts the eatery in a class of its own is its global array of buffet salads and entrees
Typical choices include breaded catfish, black peas with kaffir lime and salads like jasmine rice with sweet preserved beans and Thai basil
When it's cold, steaming mugs of hot chocolate are served with or without a homemade marshmallow
The best hot chocolate ever
This is not for those folks raised on watered down Swiss Miss
This hot chocolate is as good as my favorite cafe in Paris except maybe better because there is nothing like City Bakery's homemade marshmallows!! Yummm
I walked in with two friends not knowing what to expect
It is a bit pricey but way worth it
We took a bit of everything
I did not taste one thing that I did not love
We were discussing taking the subway from the office in Soho to get lunch a few times a week
City Bakery, could you please open in Soho? I would just die!!
We waited for months, and it finally opened on Wednesday at 12:30
The salad bar was beautiful, and I took a fairly small amount of my favourite grilled veggies, no lettuce or spinach, but my bill was still $11
On Wednesday the salad bar was $12/lb, today (two days later) it had gone up to $16/lb (mac and cheese and sliced fruit are apparently $10/lb)
Thanks, but there's a huge Whole Foods about 1/2 mile away- they have a very extensive and high quality cold and hot salad bar priced at $7/lb and a great prepared foods department
The parking at WF is much, much easier than at Brentwood Country Mart and I can do my food shopping there too
C'mon City Bakery Santa Monica, get real
Great brunch, casual, kid-friendly and hip vibe! 5 of us in bridal party met to discuss wedding stuff and it was a great place (go early, before 10:30 with group) to have a quick meeting over great brunch
I didn't have my kids, but saw other kids enjoying their meals thought great place to bring kids--not stuffy
Tried one of their muffins-it was delicious! The hot chocolate is not for everyone, but I really enjoyed the rich, smooth, decadence of indulging in a warm cup of melted chocolate
(Next time will add the marshmallow~) Couldn't (or felt too guilty to) finish it though
One of the girls put some of it in her coffee! The best was their mini egg salad with smoked salmon sandwich on a dark grainy bread- light and heavenly, reminded me of delectable tea sandwiches
Going back next weekend-- all the way from PA
city bakery is crazy expensive---no matter how i try to keep my salad bar plate light (no grilled pineapple for me), i always lay out at least $15 for lunch! but the food, esp the tortilla soup, is worth it
plus fun people watching but not too many cute guys
i love to do a shot of hot chocolate and take my buzz over to bed bath and boyfriend or tj maxipad and do a little shop shop
For someone who has never been to Spain and had the kind of hot chocolate they make there (and serve with churros), you might think this hot chocolate is too thick, but for me, it brought tears to my eyes
I lived in Spain for 3 years and miss it every day, so having one tiny cup of hot chocolate like City Bakery makes made me feel like I was in Madrid again
It is very strong and thick, and might not be for everyone, but for chocolate lovers and spaniards, it's de maravilla!!
why is their hot chocolate so thick? i could barely drink it
it really is like a melted chocolate bar! How can anyone drink this stuff? It's not drinkable
I bought a gourmet muffin ($3!) which was tasty but not enough to be worth $3
I won't be going back again
The hot chocolate is good, rich, and a little like having warm chocolate soup
It's far less viscous than a melted chocolate bar, but it's no cup of Swiss Miss
My only problem with this place is that the food is ridiculously overpriced
The quality was not good enough for the price--especially since it is buffet-style dining
The food was brillant, something for everyone
The scene was a bit chaotic and it took a while to find somewhere to sit without any sort of help from the staff
However, once seated (practically on top of the family sitting at the next table) the food was great
The room, although a bit busy, was refreshing in a light clean way that made us feel at ease
My recommendation is to go on a week day possibly before an afternoon of shopping at the farmers market
I am so outraged with ppl who constantly talks about the hot cocoa here
let me tell you one thing: it's not hot cocoa it's a hot SOUP
Too thick, too creamy, and wayyy to sweet
You are not a true hot cocoa lover if you insist the cocoa they have is phenomenal
it is nothing like cocoa
The food was ok
nothing so special
My friend who loves having Sunday brunches came over from DC so I took her to City Bakery and I must say I was VERY embarrassed
Why go here when there are so many better brunch places?? WHY?
Yummy, if overpriced, food
The salad bar is great, and the sandwich bar has interesting and delicious offerings such as white grilled cheddar on cornbread or a grilled chocolate sandwich
The crowning glory, however, is the hot chocolate
It is like drinking a melted chocolate bar
My future mother in law is still not sure what was a better moment: seeing her newborn son for the first time, or her first sip of City Bakery hot chocolate
The Sunday brunch crowd is eclectic and bursting with catchy energy
Food is good (I lenjoyed the buffet) and the baked goods are excellent (pretzel croissants, the moist cheese Danishes, lemon and chocolate tarts)
I didn't, however, like the hot chocolate
The choco content is too strong for my taste
One sad thought is that they discontinued their famous brownies
I still dont know why
i came to city bakery because i had heard about its hot chocolate, but when i bought a cup, i ended up throwing most of it away
if you REALLY love chocolate, maybe you'll like it
it is basically a melted chocolate bar, SO thick
definitely not for my liking
City Bakery is my new favorite hang out for delicious treats
The chocolate chip cookies are outstanding, like a huge disk of brown sugar with wedges of chocolate
Nothing like Toll House
And the flourless brownies are down-right decadent
The only shortfall has been the chocolate mousse tart, the shell is bland
Come for early morning criossants and you'll be hooked
the hot cocoa is truly the best in the city
the fact that they make their own marshmallows (tasty to begin with, but heavenly when dipped in the cocoa) to put on top attests to how serious this place is about quality! baked goods are sumptuous and moist, with their own distinctive homemade flavor
i'll pass on the $13/lb salad bar, but long live the cocoa desserts!
The rest, I could pretty much take it or leave it
But for those of you who won't settle for Swiss Miss, this is the one!!  Get your order to go, because it won't be an enjoyable dining experience, unless you miss the crowded college cafeteria days
Beware that on the weekends, this place can be very popular
As others mentioned, their hot chocolate is very rich, but AWESOME
Once you've tried it with one of their homemade marshmallows, you'll think other marshmallows taste like rubber

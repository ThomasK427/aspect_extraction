I have been coming to this place since it opened years ago and the food is really good
Dumplings are awesome, but if you want to try other dishes, don't be afraid to experiment
There's a crispy, sweet chrysanthemum fish and the eel with chives that I wholeheartedly recommend
Location is great and the atmosphere is very cozy
Oh yeah (no pun intended), the price will keep your wallet happy too
You have not had great dumplings until you have tried the Crab-Pork dumplings at Yeah Shanghai
They are the juiciest and tastiest I have ever eaten
The rest of the menu is good too and the lunch specials are a bargain
Wow! I really felt that I had found a good one when I walked in the New Yeah Shanghai
I grew up in Shanghai and alway try the same 4 dishes when I try out a new Shanghainee restaraunt
Boy was I disappointed tonight! First came the cold noodle dish, soggy, mushy, and pasty (because the peanut butter sauce was too thick)
The topping was dry and tough
The juicy bun was nothing special, far below what I could consider decent
Then came the worst dish, sauteed shrimp, a very popular Shanghainese dish which needs nothing more than some fresh shrimp with good handling
Ours was fishy and dirty with gutline clearly visible from miles away
The last vegetable dish was way too oily and salty
After I mentioned the shrimp to the waiter, he responded This is how frozen shrimp supposed to taste like
Needn't say no more
Forgo the overhyped soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai and order them as soon as you sit down so you can enjoy them while deciding what to order from the expansive menu
You can even watch the chef make the dumplings in the front of the restaurant
The Shanghai Rice Cake is excellent as is the Eel and Chives
One maybe better off reading Chinese and knowing Shanghai cuisine to fully appreciate Yeah Shanghai-- or bring along a friend who does, otherwise ask the waitstaff
Both the specials menus on the wall, and noodles menus on tables are Chinese and even if you're literate, the dishes may not be familiar if you've lived in China other than Shanghai
But if you can manage, then bon appetit, Yeah Shanghai is hands down the best reasonably-priced Shanghai in town
The employees are professionals; at least some came from Shanghai specifically to work there
Notice most of the customers speak Shanghai-dialect, probably it has enough business without catering to non-Shanghai types
And so is the staff, which is actually notthat common at other Shanghai places nearby
There's a profusion of Shanghai on Bayard St
, but the only other decent oneis nextdoor, Moon House
It's homestyle cooking compared to Yeah Shanghai's professional-fare
The Scene The important decor elements here are functional: cans of imported tomato sauce, big bowls of fresh basil leaves and eight or ten pans of the best pizza in the neighborhood
Otherwise, it's not much to look at: Tables are a bit grungier than at your typical by-the-slice counter
The Food The pizza is the real deal--featuring standard toppings as well as a few specialty combinations
The cheese pie balances like a jazz trio: sauce, cheese and crust each have their own texture and taste, with no one overpowering
Try the pesto and goat cheese, barbecue chicken or anything with white sauce, but avoid fresh vegetables--they wilt fast
Run by Chileans, Freddie and Pepper's also offers a tidy empanada stuffed with beef, olives, egg and lots of onions
For the meateaters, you have to try the BST (bacon, spinach, tomato) pizza - it blows all other pizza away
For veggies, the soy cheese pizza is delicious! I think this is the best pizza BAR NONE on the Upper West! You'll be addicted to the crispy crust that's just perfect
The Scene A soundtrack that alternates between hip-hop and calypso sets the tone for this island-spirited restaurant with an urban flair
Stalks of tropical red flowers and black-and-white photography from regions that inspired the cooking add sophisticated style to the place
The staff may come off as soft-spoken, but they're happy to answer any questions, and it adds to the experience that your waitress can expound on the sour sop colada--she probably had a sour sop tree in her yard growing up
The Food The vibrant menu begs diners to try something new
Sure, they've got great jerk chicken, but be adventurous and order a filet of shark sandwich, oxtail, West Indian curry, or Trinidadian stewed chicken with rum and Spanish thyme
Each artistically presented entree comes with two sides, so branch out with a delicious bowl of callaloo, a spicy green vegetable puree
This spot is lovable not because it's what you expected, but because, pleasantly, it isn't
This place is definitely a gem
The problem with many West Indian restaurants is a) you have a long wait to get your food and b) Even though the meal may be tasty the presentation normally not priority
Here at Sugarcane none of those factors is a problem you get prompt service, the large portions of food gets there in a timely fashion and usually has this nouvelle cuisine look, the bartenders are very friendly and make you feeel like family and there are night when you get live entertainment
Only downside is it is a small place and therefore can only accomodate no more than 25 people at one time anything more than that it is chaotic and crowded
But the place is so great that patrons don't mind waiting outside rather than go to another restaurant which you can find at least 10 in short walking distance
So if that does'nt sell you on visiting nothing else will
If you love food from the Caribbean, Sugarcane is a must! The food is outstanding and the service is prompt
*Don't miss out on the watermelon martini*
I had the oxtail dish with streamed cabbage and calaloo
My friend had the jumbo shrimp dish and said it was some of the best she's ever tasted
The portions are large, so be prepared to share
We visited on a Friday night and waited 45 minutes to be seated (party of 5), but it's worth the wait!
The food here is delicious! It is worth the wait, because fast food does not mean that it will be exquisite; and the food was definitely good
BETTER YET THE FOOD IS DAMN GOOD! You will have to taste the drinks to see for yourself that this restaurant is on point with pleasing their customers tastebuds
After much to do about Sugarcane I venture in on Sunday April 2, 2006 for dinner with two friends
First observation, the establishment needs more staffing; the hostess/receptionist should improve her disposition (she is the first person to greet the guests)
Bartender, should not be taking dinner orders on napkins
Dinners are served with utensils (fork, knife, spoon)
Guests should not have to ask for them
Last but not least WATER, WATER, PLEASE SERVE WATER, again guests should not have to ask for water
We never got a table
The is no reason why three grown women, each standing over 5'9 should try and eat their dinner while sitting on bar stools
Attended with 5 girlfriends on Christmas Eve to celebrate a birthday
After waiting for our waitress to address us, then to be ignored by her, then for her to roll her eyes because we asked her to return our sour drinks, she then told every waitress and waitor about out encounter which made them look at our table with the same disdain
We tried to continue our night in cheer, in which we received our bill and saw that the drinks we returned were still on it
We were forced to call the manager who explained that their policy isn't to remove returned food or drinks from the bill even if they were STALE
Overall the experience was absolutely terrible, the staff needs manners and management needs an overhaul!
My girlfriends and I discovered Sugar Cane over a year ago and are now faithful patrons
The menu is wonderfully put together with dishes that will appeal to everyone and reasonably priced
The house salad is not your standard salad by any means
I'm craving it right now
I love their drinks - so exotic and absolutely love how intimate the place is although the music can drown out the soft-spoken
If you're on a date, it's reason to get close
It's a hot spot and is very small so most evenings it's crowded - on the weekends forget about immediate seating w/o a reservation
There is a bit of lethargy among the waitstaff and can definitely be improved upon
But the food, atmosphere and company always makes up for the service
Hope this helps
First of all, everytime my girls from around the country get together we always go to the Sugar Cane! It's has fantastic music food and superb drinks ( made just right!) and it's right here in brooklyn
MChose Sugar cane and make reservations , if you just want to kick back enjoy some reggae/soca/hip-hop tunes and look at beautiful people
With all this the waitstaff and crown is no where near pretentious
I highly recommend this pplace even though there is a wait
Right off the top: the service here is HORRIBLE
I've been twice--the food drinks are slamming, and the ambiance makes it a chill spot
My second visit was awful
We were not seated by a hostess (and as a result didn't receive menus or water for a good while) and were rushed out as the restaurant closed an hour after we arrived
Fine, you say (typical NY restaurant, right?) but the straw that broke the camel's back were the attitudes of both the waitresses that served me
Rude, rude, RUDE
I refuse to spend my money there again--it's obvious that management counts on the customers to overlook the restaurant's major flaw and spend their money b/c the place is alluring fills a void for the community, but you just lost one! Get it together, people
This spot is the place to chill with special someone or with the best friends in your life
The music is kind of loud but so are the people who are trying to speak
I did not feel bad when I had to speak over everyone
The food is excellent I had the Mango flavored ribs and my friend had the trini chicken and a side of calaloo
The service was excellent the hostess was extremely helpful, and our waitress attended to us every minute
Anyone who does not like this place must not have any patience at all
It is a popular spot so that explains why it is so crowded

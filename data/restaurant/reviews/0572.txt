Breakfast is served into the late afternoon hours and is particularly delicious
My favorite dish to eat here is rather surprising: the club sandwich
Elmo is home to the elusive perfect club sandwich
complete with the best bacon I have ever tasted
My server told me that it was apple-smoked bacon
All I can say is, yes, please!
The girls and I were wandering around aimlessly looking for our Saturday lunch spot, and we fell upon Elmo
It was the perfect accidental eatery to fall into
We had great bloody mary's, a great lunch, and a cute waiter! The decor is really retro and they were playing great music! I had the California turkey burger and fries and my friends had the omelette and the grilled tuna sandwich
All the meals were really good -- definitely check this one out
The food is good ol' comfort at average prices
Some of the choices are surprisingling good
like the Mac Cheese-it's supurb, it's the best yet I've tasted here in town! The scallops are also a good choice
The look is cool, drinks good, noise level sometimes loud, decent bathrooms or potty rooms and fine service
Good date place
Thankfully, its not another Applebee's
Elmo is a much welcomed newcomer to the neghborhood
An eccletic menu with many varied choices
Try the Grilled Tuna Sandwich with Wasabi mayo
You won't be disappointed
Wonderful cocktail menu as well with drinks you won't find elsewhere
On top of that, the stylish decor kicks ass
All this and good service, too
What more could you ask for?
then go to Elmo
While this place has the most excellent decor it is so noisy that from the second I walked in I thought I would suffer from hearing loss
Its not worth it to suffer for the mediocre food
Also, the train runs right underneath and you hear the rattle every few minutes
Very trendy joint in Chelsea - typically not my scene b/c I NEVER go to a restaurant based on its hipness
Food is first and foremost, which isn't bad at Elmo
A friend treated me there for dinner
The bread basket was a plate of sesame/garlic flat breads, vegetable sticks and hummus for dipping
Quite good, actually
Artichoke heart and mesclun salad with lemon dressing was also good, and so was fried calamari
My grilled raw tuna and arugula sandwich with wasabi mayo was well prepared and flavored, as was my friend's simple meat loaf
Solid fare but nothing so good to brag about
Prices were not bad but service could be a little better
Waiter was friendly but a little slow
He asked me how I wanted my grilled RAW tuna
I said as raw as you can get
i stumbled into this new neighborhood local for dinner recently with greater expectations
i left most disappointed
why? quite simply the food was awful - from the catchy dishes on the menu i expected more
we received very poor quality food that many new york diners would have been ashamed to serve
however, although not my persuasion, for those inclined, the best thing about this restaurant/bar was the bleckner above the bar and the booty upfront! but then it's chelsea, so isn't that everywhere?
I went here the first week that it opened, and was not impressed
The service was slow, and the food was cold
I went back a month later, and they've worked out the kinks
The food is good
I've enjoyed the Soba Noodles with Grapefruit on several occasions
The service is very reliable
On my last visit, we were seated at the only available table, next to a birthday party
When the party seemed to get a little more spread out with guests hovering around our table, we were promptly whisked to another table upon request
Outside, your dog can find water dishes and the host stand has doggie treats
Also, they have an excellent brunch complimented with thick and rich bloody marys
elmo is a great, easy-going restaurant
Fresh and light atmosphere (although a little loud for my taste)with friendly, smiling and attentive service
The food is terrificly comfortable at reasonable prices
Generous portions nicely presented
My one disappointment was the clams casino - they were delicious, but for a $10 appetizer, very skimpy
The bartenders are consistently capable - I've had many (well, not THAT many) different drinks in the six times I've eaten there and they always taste great - well mixed! This is a great place for spontaneous dinners out and great evenings with friends
The food was great
THe service was great and I love the decor
The best part was that the prices were reasonble and I woud highly recommend it
Bidding fair to become Cafeteria's prime competition along Seventh Avenue, Elmo is a pretty newcomer to the Chelsea scene
The neighborhood is bursting with restaurants, but most fall into two categories: tony and expensive (The Tonic, Le Madri, AZ) or reasonable and mediocre (most anything along Eighth Avenue)
There are a few exceptions, of course, but Elmo fills a nice niche by being modestly priced, sufficiently swank, and blessed with solid, tasty food
Nothing will blow your socks off, but it's all nicely presented and well prepared
The killer cocktail list is a true highlight; the friendly but often distracted service is not
Final analysis: a good place to go with friends for great drinks, good food, and a good time
You could certainly do worse in this nabe
i've been to the restaurant downstairs a few times, and i've never been disappointed
the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees, including fresh seafood and huge steaks, there's also a couple of non-meat alternatives
everything is scrumptious, from the excellent service by cute waitresses, to the extremely lush atmosphere
they really provide a relaxing, laid-back atmosphere
it's a great place to kick back with friends, as well as take a first date
the upstairs lounge/bar continues the relaxed, chill-out feel, and they have specialty martinis to die for - try out their special champagne martini!! there's also a very nice appetizer menu at the bar if you're just interested in drinks and munchies, and the service is great upstairs as well
on the right night, you'll catch a live band, or you can play the jukebox to your heart's content
mixed gay/straight crowd, cool vibe
Last week, I had dinner with a couple who were recent transplants and we agreed on Indian cuisine
We previewed the website menu and it helped
The place was sparse at 6 PM (of course NYers eat 7:30 on) and service was okay
She had a vegetarian entree and he had a stuffed portobello mushroom
(Thank God for a vegetarian selection, I would have egg in my face, if I took them to Luger's) I had a surprisingly good salmon with a reddish brown curry sauce that didn't taste like the powdered kind you're used to
All good reviews around the table and just have a mango Lassi to douse the spice
The hostess was apologetic enough when service was non existent towards the end because they had to fill in lots of take out orders
Oh, so that's why the place was quite empty? Go figure
This is the worst service I've encounter in my past two years of living in the city
The staff was very rude and we had to beg to get water
The food was ok at best
Great, reasonable Indian food
You'll find dishes here you're unlikely to encounter anywhere else
The service is a little spotty, but well-inteneded and the food is worth it
Two words: Awesome Food! You MUST MUST MUST try the 'frankies'
trust me they are to die for
But watch out for the spices! (I made the chef make mine less spicy)
I also highly recommend the shrimp toast
Lunch buffet is also an excellent bargain
But believe me: Go and try the Frankies
You won't regret it

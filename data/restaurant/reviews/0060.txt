Service was horrible and the food wait was outrageous
The restaurant is highly not recommended
Jekyll and Hyde Pub is great! We had over 100 beers to choose from and the food and service was excellent
The second we walked in the hostess was polite and friendly
The hostess asked where we would like to be seated either the patio or the Grand Salon
We chose the Grand Salon so we can enjoy the entertainment
Next time I will sit out on the sidewalk cafe so we can enjoy the village atmosphere
I highly recommend you visit this resturant the decor and entertainment is like have Disney in NYC
We were in the village on Saturday night and checked out the Jekyll and Hyde Pub on seventh ave
The beer selection was awesome with over 100 differnt beers to choose from
We ordered the steak and two monster burgers
Well I was pleasantly surprised how good the food tasted
The service was great
We even asked for the manager so we can tell him how much we enjoyed this place
You should check out the bathrooms they are hidden really cool place
We loved it
I went with my girl friend and we had the best time
A lot of energy and I loved the actors who came to our table
I had a steak and it was great and reasonably priced
Good beer selection too!
What can I say
great food, grat service, friendly staff and rally unusual atmosphere
I had a burger which was great and my wife had a steak
Really good and reasonably priced
we had a great time
This place was great! Unusual entertainment happened all the time
All kinds of spooky special effects
The satff was really nice too
I also really enjoyed my meal
I really love these place
I have been to mid town restaraunt before, but I never went here
It is smaller and more intiamte, but just as fun
Great entertainemt and food
It was very cosy
The only draw back was that it was bit too crowded
I went there with a huge group of friends
Thank GOD my b/f and I ate b4 going there
We ordered a plate of calamari and a soda float and a coke
At the end of the night our tab was 30 plus $2 entertainment fee
Definetly not worth it
If you're there for fun yes, but please don't order their food
Located in the scenic West Village, JH attracts the typical passerby with its offbeat charms and promises of a unique dining experience
Once inside it's when the horror really begins
Waited 20 min to be seated and another 20 to have our orders taken, not because the restaurant was busy but just because our waitress forgot we were there
Next came the corny actor playing the role of dreadful British butler, with lines too cheesy for even a B horror movie
Top it off with decent but very overpriced food
The ultimate insult came at the end, when while searching a good 5 min for the hidden entrance to the restroom among the bookshelf walls (you heard correct), the overhead announcer described my pathetic attempts to find the bathroom door to the entire restaurant the whole time
Nothing like having an entire restaurant watch as you search for the potty
Take it for what it is, a theme restaurant complete with noise and crowds
It's small and crowded, but not as dramatic and noisy as the location uptown
Good food and service
Great social place to hang out with friends for drinks or a quick meal espceially during Halloween
Went with a group a couple of weeks ago
The food is nothing special and service is slow and unattentive
Theme and actors are kinda cool but you are charged some entertainment fee on top of the expensive food and drinks
Not enough good entertainment to pay for it
Manager never came to address our complaint and they only take cash or AMEX
Basically, ok food, below averge drinks and badly run and managed
The bartenders were insanely rude, the crowd was dull and the food was overpriced and mediocre
Avoid this place at all costs

All right
this place was ok I guess since they have karaoke goin' on with a free shot if you sing
BUT
WHOA
do not go for the food~!! The spicy marinara wasn't spicy at all
The cajun fries
yeah those bad boys were just REG-U-LAR fries
And the one alcoholic drink my honey and I ordered had absolutely no liquor in it
and I don't mean that it had ABSOLUT
There was nothing there
Anyways--don't go for the food
But otherwise it's a pretty chill place
But I think there are a whole bunch of other karaoke bars you could go to instead
Oh yeah--and when we first walked in--the waiter said they only take cash or AMEX
Since we only had VISA he had to go check it out with the manager to manager to make sure it was ok first
Whatever~ Who only takes cash or AMEX besides Neiman Marcus?
I enjoyed the atmosphere that was provided although the food was a bit expensive
The drinks are incredibly delicious and appealing
A bit personal though but still enjoyable
the waiters and actors there are great and marvelous
It's just an overall great place to go and be
I had a great time doing Scareoke at Jekyll and Hyde pub
I am going to go every Friday night
The host Jason was great and funny
My waiter Manny was cool and even sang
Their collection of songs grows everytime I go
Plus, you get a free shot every time you sing
It's awesome
If you're easily amused, and have a high tolerence for SCREAMING AND CRASHING, and often wonder to yourself, What am I going to do with all this dern money??, this is the place for you
However, you're bothered by things like sub-par food (don't get the cajun fries), waiters who hate you and anything that looks like you, close proxmitity with strangers, and cheap talking and singing skelletons, do NOT go
The popular misconception is that it's dinner and a story, which is not the case
It's improv actors with bad British accents bothering people who don't want to play along
You'll eventually find yourself thinking, hey, isn't Hell supposed to be hotter?
and more entertaining?  Needless to say, not the best place to bring your date
Food, service and atmosphere were all horrible
Our waitress even argued with us!
the atmosphere was great
the service and food weren't great

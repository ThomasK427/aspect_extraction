Steaks were alright, considering a few of the medium rares/rares came out closer to medium
Dessert wasn't anything special
Service was a bit slow even though we were only one of a few tables there that night
Having made a point of seeking out each newly opened steakhouse contender, I can say, pound-for-pound, Bobby Van's on Park serves the best steaks in Manhattan is #2 to Luger's overall in NYC
I believe this because after dining at other pretenders to the throne, I still come back to Bobby Van's have been there more times than any other steakhouse in the city
Their ribeye and porterhouse have never been cooked poorly in all the times I have been there, and their hashed browns and creamed spinach rank with the best in the city
Their waitstaff is exactly what it should be in a steakhouse, and although the joint is packed to the gills with Wall Streeters (aren't most steakhouses anyway?), the fact remains that it's always packed
I will be a lifetime customer of this Bobby Van's
This place served wonderful food but it seems overpriced and the portions are huge
Maybe restaurants in the US can help the obesity problem by cutting the portion size or offering smaller portions for adults
Otherwise the food was excellent - we went around 8:30 on Tues night and waited 15 minutes for a table
Everyone was courteous and the servers were attentive
It is a great place for steaks just expect to pay almost $100 pp
Exceptional service and food! Possibly the bast steak I have ever eaten!
My friends and I dine at various New York steakhouses frequently
By far, this was the worst Steakhouse in the city
Bobby Van's lost (or did not take) our reservations and repeatedly blamed us for it; the clientele was rude and obnoxious; the bar was over crowded, the restaurant was smoky and loud the service was mediocre
Thankfully, the steak was good, but the food couldn't save the restaurant from a bad rating
We dined here on December 2 and were very impressed with the whole dining experience
The service was prompt and efficient
I had the bone in rib eye cooked perfectly rare accompanied by a great salad and fried zucchini
The restaurant was packed on a Monday night!! The portions here are big and the quality of the steaks is first rate
This is truly one of the best steakhouses in NYC and in the US
I'm reposting my first anonymous review: Been there, ate that! Yup, been to them all: Luger's, Palm, Sparks, Michael Jordan's, Keen's, Old Homestead, Gallagher's, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Christo's; but there's one place I keep going back to, Bobby Van's
They serve New York's BEST steak, period
Luger's is overrated, Sparks is very good, but none serve a better steak than Bobby Van's
No, I don't work for Bobby Van's, I just LOVE steak, and Bobby Van's is the place I go to for the Best! Service is superior! Wine list is extensive
Appetizers very good, but the steak is second to none! If you're serious about eating steak, try the porterhouse for two
All other cuts are great though
Check them out and you'll see
I've been there many times and they've been very consistent
This place is great if your looking to go try some wines
What a selection! We only had dessert here but it was great too
This place is expensive but not outrageous
The decor is cool and the view out the front to Rockefeller Plaza is great
In Short With its dark wood details, celebrity photos and tuxedo-clad waiters, this upscale steakhouse chain has the air of a posh men's club
Service is professional and discreet, with bartenders making a mean martini
Dinners begin with a waiter-driven cart laden with fresh vegetables, live lobster and cuts of steak; customers choose from porterhouse, rib-eye, bone-in prime rib and more
Side dishes are traditional and enormous, from baked potatoes and creamed spinach to steamed broccoli with hollandaise
Morton's - be it the city one, the one in GN, DC, or elsewhere - is the only steakhouse I've encountered thus far that knows how to cool a filet mignon
I like my filet medium rare on the rare side and without fail, Morton's comes through every time
The outside portion of the steak is so flavorful too, you don't even need salt
Went for a private party, incredible food, each course got better and better
Order the Porterhouse steak - you wont need a knife
The steak (double cut filet) was delicious here, but several of the other items on the menu fell a little flat
Scallops appetizer was overcooked, spinach was tasty but lukewarm
The hollandaise sauce was excellent but the peppercorn cognac sauce disappointed
The desserts were only so-so
I think there are better steakhouses in NYC for a great overall dining experience, but if you're just looking for good MEAT, you can't go wrong here!
I've dined at Morton's in Boston, Chicago, Palm Beach, and New York
Each one is excellent! The Scallops are an excellent starter
The Porterhouse was cooked to perfection, and very juicy
Make sure that you save room for the Godiva Chocolate cake
It is like a slice of heaven on earth!
Nationally reknowned Morton's on 5th Avenue is a dining experience
Before you even get to eat their famous steaks, or their amazing fresh baked bread, they put on a presentation, intricately describing their various cuts of meat, the way they are cooked, and do it with a smile
There is usually not a wait, and while pricey, it is well worth it
I have been to Morton's several times, and go back frequently for the quality of food and service
Went to Morton's with high expectations but was sorely disappointed
Porterhouse was tough and fatty
My girlfriend had the Filet
It was not cooked properly and very bland
Appetizers and dessert were excellent, but the supporting cast did not make up for the $250+ bill
Service was capable and seating comfortable
But there needs to be more that a few bright spots when you are spending that kind of money for a meal
Gallagher's is reliable and A M a great value
Visit at your own risk
This was the second time I've went to Morton's and I have to say the food was good but the service was excellent
I accidently had some red wine spilled on my table
And I was surrounded by the staff immediately
One took care of the broken glass, another gave me napkins, and within moments they prepared another table for us
I was impressed
By the way make sure you select the hot deserts they have
Although I have never been to Morton's in Chicago, I have been to Morton's in Denver and I have to say that my dining experience in New York was nothing like in Denver
I was disappointed with my filet
It was charred on the outside and it wasn't that tender
Everything else was fine and as I had remembered esp the godiva chocolate cake
I have had good experiences in the past with Morton's and I usually love my dinner, but I am not sure I will go back to the one here in the city
I just went here for the first time a couple of weeks ago
I wasn't expecting much from a chain steakhouse
Well, I was very surprised
The service was impeccable, the atmosphere was the stereotypical upper-tier steakhouse atmosphere, and the food
well, it was great! I had the cajon ribeye, which was outstanding
I also tried my friend's filet, which had to be one of the best I've ever tasted
The portions, btw, are HUGE
I couldn't even finish half of my steak
I also ordered the godiva dessert everyone raves about (have to order it 40 minutes in advance)
I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but this treat was certainly up there
Great place to go for business lunch -- not too noisy or crowded
The Cajun Ribeye Steak is the greatest I have ever had in my life
For a person who eats the day away dining at Mortons and having their Cajun Ribeye steak is THE STEAK that made me a steak fan
It doesnt come with it but ask for Bernaise sauce
It will be the most delicioius sensuous steak you will ever eat in your life
Sinking your teeth into your first bite and you will know that this is no ordinary steak!, the meat has been aged to perfection and is so tender and exquisite its practically voluptuous in its flavor, it can almost melt in your mouth and leave you with nothing but savory satisfaction
The food and service here are impeccible
The steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection
We were a small party (2) but we were treated like queens and had about 3 waiters taking care of us and all of our needs
I would reccommend that you skip the mashed potatoes but under NO circumstances shoukd you miss the hot Godiva cake
It is a little piece of chocolate heaven
Morton's has amazing steak and desserts

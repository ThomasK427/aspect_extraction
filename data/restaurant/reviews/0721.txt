it was great Jubani and his staff were amazing! Starting with the service, the rose petals, sangria, and music; This place is a great place to throw a party
Trust me I am soooo Picky ask Jubani:)  Had tons of fun guys!!!! You rock!
I was for new year's day this is the best place to celebrate , nice food nice music and the best service that I ever had in NY I really come back to this place
my wife and I came down from the upper east side
great ambiance, wonderful service, excellent food and the price was right
my only regret is that there is a two piece band, guitar and bongo drums, the music is good but its almost impossible to hear any conversation with your partner
better, in my opinion, to have low background music
but we will definitely be back, despite having to take 3 different subways!!
We cannot comment on the food, but it hard to have respect for a restaurant that takes a reservation for a birthday party of 6 and calls THREE HOURS before the reservation on a Saturday night to tell you that it cannot be honored
No efforts were made to accomodate us for their error and they were rude and condescending over the phone
The reviews sound great but we will NEVER spend our money in this restaurant
Awesome restaurant
Food was great, very generous portions and reasonably priced
Fun and friendly staff
Service was very attentive
Only negative is that the desserts could stand improvement
Look forward to returning again!
Many of the rave reviews here appear to have been made by people with a vested interest in the restaurant (e
g
family, owners, friends, etc
)
It's an okay place, and worth a visit, but don't get fooled by all the it'll blow your socks off comments
Since I thought great things of the sister restaurant, Cuba, I decided to try this one for Tapas and Sangria
I found it to be better on service, better on Sangria and better on the overall experience (probably because it was not as packed)
I heard that the bartender was named the best red sangria maker in the New York Times, but the white sangria was awesome
We order about every appetizer there was and enjoyed them all, especially the Ceviche
We also really enjoyed the live band
More of a friends or 2nd/3rd date spot
Really fantastic find - the service is great on every level, food is great - much variety many choices on menu
and $25 pitcher of sangria!
I've never tried cuban food before, but after going here I was blown away! The food was so reasonably priced at around $12-$15 per entree and the portions were huge
Definitely a great idea to share
The live music on Fridays also can't be missed because the band was so great when I went
We all wanted to go dancing afterwards
It was my birthday and they were nice enough to bring out the cake with an insane candle the lit up the whole restaurant
Overall it's a really small cozy place, but with reservations it's the perfect date or large group setting
Our overall experience was fantastic! The food was inexpensive, tasted great and the plate sizes made them all good for sharing, the service was great (they even served the birthday cake), and the patio outside makes you feel like you are far away from the city
The only snag: I made reservations for a large group (12) 3 weeks ahead of time on the patio
I call backed to reconfirm a week later and they couldn't find the reservation
I made it again and reconfirmed the day before/day of as well
It would be difficult to have a large group inside
But the patio is great and its covered!
Took a date here last week
Tried it because I really liked the sister resteraunt, Cuba, in the village (on Thompson)
The staff was very friendly (even remembered my name when I was leaving)
The resteraunt is small, but has a very cozy feel
We both enjoyed our meals
Serving sizes are fairly large so you relaly don't need an appetizer (though they were very tasty)
Definitely a good option if you are heading out in the west village
After having ordered takeout from Havana repeatedly, I finally sat down for a meal when a good friend came to town
As usual, the food was fantastic
I recommend the more traditional items like ropa vieja and arroz con pollo
Their empanadas are also tasty
Stay away from the more wild chicken dishes
They end up not tasting like anything someone expects from cuban food
If you're looking for something to drink, their mojitos are well mixed and well received
Besides the fact that I was sat next to a large palm (which I finally rotated to keep from attacking my head), the services was good (as are the prices
)
The food was magnificent
If you are a fish fan, please try the snapper
You will not regret it!!! And te chicken croquettes, my gosh, they were wonderful!!! The food (that I had was delicious) I cannot speak for the other dishes
It can be a pain to communite with the waiters when they do not not understand English, properly
but other wise, the restaurant is afforadable and I apln to go there in the future
Let me tell u, i like cuban food, so I went to this place and the food was so so, the service was ???? first this girl at the door she wasn't nice with us at all and she look's at us like wear and then the server didn't tell us the special's I mean my night was, i don't even want to tell you, guys just be profecional at least try that's all
In a nutshell, we really liked this place
The service was great
We loved sitting in the patio
You feel like your on an island
When we went it was very hot humid outside
The servers brought over a fan and it did the trick
The food was very good and the portions and prices were reasonable
We will go back!!
I came here with some friends and we had an awesome time
the place is cozy and inviting,and the live music adds more vibrance
As a small place we felt very accomodating, the servers,hostesses and very gracious manager, we can't ask more, they were nice and helpul
About the food we had a little difilculty keeping the orders straight ,the menu has too many choices,but the server was very helpul and suggested de paella valenciana which was extremele delicious
I really had a good time and looking forward to going back again
it was my friend's bday and we wanted to try somethin' new
i went to havana b4 our dinner meeting to drop off cupcakes that says hapi bday mae!
it turned out that after our dinner and we wer ready for our desert, everyone started singing happy bday inc
the band in cuban
even i was surprise how great it was
exciting at the same time romantic, our server IVAN, he was alot of fun, and very accomodating
the band was good
ty!
I ate here a few days ago with the expectation of authentic and tasty Cuban food
I certainly did not get that at Havana Alma de Cuba
The food was below average and bland
The ambience was okay and the live band was nice, but it didn't make up for the mediocre food quality
I won't be going back
It makes you wonder if all the reviews were written by friends and families of the owner
The ambience is great
However, the food is absolutely tasteless
I had chunks of fried pork a dish that is virtually impossible to screw-up (they did) The services is good but you get the feeling that they are trying to run you out of the place
The hostess was a dull as dial tone and unfriendly
You are better off saving your money and buying yourself a plane ticket to Miami to get some real Cuban food
Ps/ If you are going to have saint displayed at least have the decency to have Cuba's patron saint not Mexico's
The place was just down right a great place to be on a nice cool evening
with a date
The food was amazing (their paella, chuleta, empanadas, mojitos!!), the service was great (you don't feel rushed, very relaxed, friendly), the atmosphere (mello, dim lights, a hint of romance, live band, not noisy, the place was totally a piece of Cuba)

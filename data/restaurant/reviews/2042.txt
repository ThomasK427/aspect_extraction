My friends and I go there almost every tuesday and enjoy it every time
What better than a refreshing margarita for after work?
There is no place like Tio Pepe
Every time I eat there, I sit in the enclosed garden room in the back
It is so beautiful with all of the hanging plants, and quite cozy in the winter time
But best of all is the paella
Usually I order an appetizer like garlic shrimp and split a paella with my boyfriend
I wont forget to mention the pitcher of sangria that I always order
We keep coming back to Tio Pepe for the paellas and drinks
No where else in the village can you find a bigger or better martini than the one Tio Pepe's friendly bartender serves up
The waitstaff is friendly and loves to celebrate birthdays
We keep reccomending this place to all of our friends and family because it is so reliable and a whole lot of fun!
We had a great night out sitting in the romantic garden sipping margaritas and enjoying the daily specials
My date and I enjoyed everything from the Tapas (appitezers) through desert and I will never forget the Tio Pepe coffee
I recomend Tio Pepe to everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great patio out back; paella was solid; wait staff very attentive and friendly; fajitas also very good
I drank negra modela, my girlfriend drank mango margaritas
I ordered mexican, my girlfreind ordered spanish
Tio Pepe was the perfect place for the both of us
We left very happy and we will be sure to return again
With an expert chef, friendly waiters, and a romantic dining area, Tio Pepe is a dependable place for any occasion
They are great with kids offering virgin specialty drinks and smaller portions
And I wont forget to mention how good their adult drinks are! And yes, the Paella Valencia is a wonderful selection
No better place in New York for Paella Valenciana for two and a pitcher of sangria
Sit in the romantic skylit garden adn save room for dessert
With windows on lively West 4th Street, recently refurbished Tio Pepe is a dependable Village favorite of ours
We like to go with five or six friends and share an assortment of the delectable tapas with superb margaritas, before moving on to one of the great Spanish or Mexican entre selections
Someone always tries one of the assortment of paellas, still an unbeatable value at $12
95, but we like the pork and steak preparations
The expert chef does well by the seafood dishes, as well
Best of all are the attentive but unobtrusive waiters, who are never far away and always eager to please
The lovely skylighted garden room is a tad crowded for true romance, but we've had some promising dates there, nonetheless
For many reasons--food, service, and ambience--it's almost impossible to avoid a great time here
It has a beautiful garden
great service, great food, great atmosphere
The Scene In the eye-popping interior, coated with hokey, glittery pop art from Mexico and the Southwest, the spirited waitstaff somehow manages to keep their wits about them as they serve American-Mexican to bachelorette parties and other celebrating groups
The Food Surprisingly tasty dishes, such as the New Mexican short stack--made with blue-corn pancakes, black beans, shredded beef (or chicken or veggies) and melted cheese on top
Good, fresh-tasting burritos come slathered in a chili sauce available in three grades of spice
Pitchers of margaritas are prepared with your choice of tequila--opt for something other than standard Cuervo for a bright libation
I believe I was here a few years ago with a couple of cousins had a fine time then
Drinking, etc
A Wednesday ago, on the other hand, I had a different ( noteworthy) experience
One is, of course, always stunned by the power of air-conditioning when one walks into an establishment on a hot day
Esp
so here, esp
so on the evening in question
Point! (It is common to teach children to preface a complaint with a compliment
) Now to the matter
Imagine, reader, that some time passes
I, going to the lavatory, enter the lavatory, open the lone stall's saloon-style doors, --what? A sh*t-covered toilet seat, a smear of sh*t on the floor, a sh*t-filled pair of chuddies in the rubbish bin
The margaritas are passable
I went here last night on a date, and we were immediately seated outside
This apparently is not the norm, so I guess we were just lucky
The food is surprisingly good considering the prices are relatively cheap for the area
Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and we got free shots of tequila! The margaritas are amazing (try the strawberry)! Overall I would definitely recommend trying this place out!
I went to Tortilla Flats for a birthday dinner
lets just say they served us tequila shots with a candle in a lime instead of the traditional birthday cake
It was great! They totally put the birthday girl on the spot in front of everyone there, but I was all in good fun
The margaritas are good (we got them by the pitcher)
The food was so so
but if you go to Tortilla Flats you go for the drinks and the fun atmosphere
the chips were not good at all, and the salsa was just okay
friendly waiter and great margaritas, but my chicken fajitas were barey edible
i only had one
when the plate was brought to me, it looked like it had been sitting out for an hour, they way the beans were congealed
Also, they were not sizzling and lacked the traditional fajita flavor
Instead, it tasted like the chicken was covered in curry powder
The waiter failed to ask me if something was wrong with the food, when he took away my full plate
I left the restaurant hungry
The food is excellent
though how could cheese, sour cream spicy chicken be anything else! However, my sangria was below par:-( It is extremely cheap and good for group dinners so if some in the group are price conscious, this is your place
I wouldn't recommend it for a date unles you'd rather not talk to him/her! Atmosphere is tackyish, similar to that of a loud college bar, but that's what it is meant to be so if you don't like that, don't go
I'm from Texas and I know good Mexican food and Tortilla Flats' food is delicious, especially the Mole Shrimp enchiladas that they make for me because I don't eat chicken, and the big soft shrimp tacos are my second favorite
I love to go here on Tuesday night and play Bingo
I never win, but it's fun
Every time I go, with a group or just 2 people, the waiters cannot be nicer
The manager even let me use the kitchen phone once when my friend was lost trying to find his way there and I didn't have my cell phone
He even gave me a seat out front so I could watch for him - how nice is that??? This place is so loud, fun, and the food so yummy it makes up for the fact that the margaritas need a little work
The Sangria is good though!
Beware: 2 pitchers of margs on the rocks will run you about $90
Even though potency receives and A+ in my book (being from TX I am quite the connoisseur), that is quite a bill for beverages served in pitcher form
Also, steer clear of the farthest table in the back of patio
There is a dryer vent spewing hot humid air which engulfs your legs
My advice: fashion a menu to funnel the air away and bring out that Visa card because these margs will either polish you off or be the beginning of a CRAZY night
I have been going to Tortilla Flats for over 10 years
It is definitely a loud, get drunk and party kind of place
Some have complained about the frozen margaritas and I have to agree that you are better off getting your margarita on the rocks
Order the chile con queso which is absolutely delicious and then I get the chicken fajitas

always a winner
Douse your fajitas with some of the delicious bottled green sauce that they keep on the table and if it is not there

ask for it
That bottled green sauce is so delicious (not too spicy and very tasty) and I have only been able to find it at the mexican specialty shop called Kitchen in Chelsea
Be prepared for loud music
I have never been here before and showed up with 20 of my closest friends to celebrate my birthday! The place is small, but the staff was excited to have us and more than accomodating! It was a very memorable experience!
I took my friends from Atlanta to Tortilla Flats in hopes of some good food, music, drinks and fun atmopshere
I will NEVER go back!!!! The music inside was so loud, the waitress couldn't even get our order straight, until there was a break in the sound
We were at a table for 6 and could only speak to the person either next or directly across
My pollo verde looked like microwave verde, and my friends quesadilla looked worse

The monkfish liver, replete with silky foie gras texture and ocean flavor, is truly memorable
But it was all downhill from there
Shaved artichoke and celery salad was good, but not earthshaking by any stretch
For entrees the suckling pig is a ho-hum pile of pulled pork and the fish-of-the-day was merely good
We did enjoy the recommended, yet simple $40 sangiovese, atmosphere and loosey-goosey service, but we were disappointed overall
I'm not quite sure what the big fuss is all about - we went there for dinner very excited after having read a New York Times article about Ms
Hamilton's restaurant
After being seated next to a waiter's station and practically on top of the bathroom, we ate an oversalted and overpriced meal in cramped quarters
The waitstaff was friendly, but a little too overzealous about every item on the menu
is it off topic to rant about the rude hostess? i am surprised i even enjoyed my meal despite the surly hostess' welcome
on to better topics- the food- delicious and delicate order the plum sorbet
and listen to the helpful waitress' recommendations!
Ate at Prune for the first time and absolutely loved it
Good service, but the real star was the food
I had six different items on the menu (yes, I am a trencherman) and three were simply OUTSTANDING: the steak, the sweetbreads (best I've ever had), and the monkfish liver (also the best I've ever had)
The other three were all very good, from the cheese appetizer to the softshell crab to the peach-and-ice cream dessert
The waitress thoughtfully brought me a small after-dinner wine (gratis) which paired perfectly with the dessert
If you want food that will leave you smiling all evening, try Prune
I'll be back!
the brunch at prune is very good, but it is not worth waiting in long lines with very rude hostesses
the last time i went, the hostess was so rude i decided that i will not go back there
I've been to Prune 9 times in the past two years
I have NEVER been disappointed
The simple, imaginative food is prepared with love and intelligence
The ingredients are superlative and the chef allows the flavors to shine
It's not fancy - it's extremely crowded, the chairs are hard, it's a wrestling match to get in and out, so what? The servers are delightful
It is hip and funky and such fun for out of towners
Perhaps the negative reviews on this board are by people who just don't get this kind of food
It's not about status or luxury - this is for serious food lovers who aren't at all pretentious
The monkfish liver, white anchovies, Jersey tomatoes, spaghetti carbonara, roast suckling pig, mojitos, bloody marys (I like the Maria with the splash of Sauza!), eggs benedict, monte cristo, really everything I've ever had here has been just sublime
I made the mistake of coming here with 5 friends for brunch so the wait was extremely long and then we got stuck at the only table big enough for 6 (downstairs near the bathroom away from all of the other patrons) so that was dissapointing but I will be back soon with 1 or 2 friends
The food and service were great and the atmosphere and music upstairs made you feel like you were somewhere in Europe
And the hostess was very kind and kept apologizing for the very long wait
Great place for brunch but not for more than 4
After reading the recent reviews on Citysearch, I was prepared to be met with the typical rude and chilly service that is frequent in most New York restaurants
My friend and I experienced quite the opposite
The hostess was absolutely delightful and welcoming
Our table was ready within 5 minutes after we arrived for our reservation which on a Friday night is not bad
Our waitress was friendly and accomodating
We felt the menu was unsual and everything we ordered was delicious
Even a simple plate of radishes with butter and salt tasted special at Prune
I would definitely go back
i thought the food was great but kind of expensive for that atmosphere, the tables were too close and it was too noisy
the whole fish was very good
Although the food was very good, it was deeply overpriced
The main courses came with no sides at all, and had we not ordered some boiled greens, we would have felt deeply disappointed
It's good to realize that the place is actually very casual
Having looked at the prices, I had figured it was a fancy, special occasion restaurant, but in a dress I felt very conspicuous
It's almost like eating at mom's, only paying through the nose
To the place's credit, the waitstaff was lovely
The menu is small and does not cater to vegetarians
The fish was oversalted and stuffed as if following a step by step plan from the naked chef
Overpriced for what its worth, my dinner companion's meat dish was all fatty
The staff though kind, stared uncomfortably before and during our meal
Though many spaces in the EastV
are tiny, this one pushes the limits where its nearly impossible to cut your meal without elbowing your neighbor talking about her latest marc jacobs bag acquisition
Prune was one of my worst dining experiences either
While the pocket-sized restaurant could have been charming, the food, served in miniscule portions, went from ok to really not good
The service, in jeans and something pink, were snotty
Their timing was off, they were rude, they cleared dishes before they were finished (for no apparent reason), and pressured us to order more than we were ordering (already a dish per person)
When we declined alcohol our server gave us a sour face
The food was waaaaay too expensive for the place
I can't get enough of this little place
The restaurant is as brilliantly charming as the waitstaff and the food is even better
I am tempted to stop by nightly after work for a drink at the bar and a go at the bites on the bar menu
lamb sausages and deviled eggs are great, but the homemade pate sandwich is the best
We went as a group of 6 and were told our table would come up in an hour
We waited 2 and 1/2 hours and the hostess was rude
The wait staff was nice; pleasant but the hostess was abrasive
Given that there are many place to eat in nyc, I would not go back to prune
Living in NYC and having tried countless restaraunts, I can honestly say that Prune is one of the worst experiences in the city
It appears that there is a community of people who either through working there or knowing the owners post positive review of the place
My honest opinion is that this place is oversold and overpriced
Go see for yourself if you want cramped seating, mediocre appetizers (avoid the briny, vein in 'ruby shrimp appetizer)
Save your meny and enjoy yourself, as you will not at Prune
I am a foodie and was excited to try Prune
I am sad to say that my entree was absolutely awful (I had the chicken
basically a boiled thigh and wing served with NO seasoning or veggies
just a little broth 2 much too livery liver dumplings)
I went with 4 friends none of them enjoyed their entrees
In fact, one of the women who will put salt on absolutely anything could not eat her Ruby Shrimp because it was way too salty
None of us finished our tiny entrees
On top of that, after they took our plates, we had to stare at the shells (from the shrimp entree) which were all over the table
The waiters didn't clean it up until they brought our dessert
I hate when the service doesn't clear the food from the table after you're finished
And the prices
whew!
The bloodymarys rule the roost here
Get the Chicago and enjoy more pickled vegetables than you knew existed
The food is fantastic, but I find the brunch portions rather small
We always end up ordering sides and whatnot which jacks our check up considerably
Waits on the weekends for brunch have gotten out of hand - so I'm tired of waiting an hour for eggs and lamb sausage
But the place is small, what do you expect? A great place for showing outtatowners a hip NYC experience
We dig it!
We went for brunch on Sunday
There's a scene in there, and the food is wonderful, but the host wasn't even close on wait times, and the service was acceptably prompt without being spectacular
However, once you start eating you will probably forget all that and be absorbed in your meal
It's that good
food was good and it is eccentric and different
however, service was slow and food was not worth the price

Without a reservation, don't even bother
Excellent, reasonably priced southwestern cuisine that is served in a comfortable dining room with white adobe walls
There is also a glassed in seating area in the front that opens in the summer to allow you to watch people on the street while you dine, a small porch area, as well as a spacious bar
Appetizers to try are the outstanding grilled corn on the cob, queso fundido, ceviche, calamari, tuna tostaditas, and crab stuffed in a squash blossom
Entrees include tasty quesadillas in a number of varieties, but the soft fish tacos are the best and are served with guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and spanish rice
The service is the best
attentive, friendly, and the management are concerned that you have a great meal
For dessert try the creamy banana praline ice cream and molten cake or the mango cheesecake
I just made my second trip to Agave on Tuesday and was just as impressed the second time around
You never know if a good experience at a restaurant is normal for the restaurant or a fluke
It's good to know that I can go somewhere and expect amazing food with fantastic service--not to mention the margaritas
My waiter knew all about the 50+ tequilas and recommended one--can't remember the name(Epsolon, I think), but it was the best thing I've ever tasted!! LISTEN TO YOUR WAITER!!
Despite one of my party being late by half an hour past my reservation, the hostess tried her best to accomodate us
When my friend arrived, we were promptly seated and it's was a great time after that
Service was excellent, the waiter was happy to answer any questions about any of the dishes and the food was more than enough for one person
We all had to pack it to take home
We all tried each other's dishes and everything tasted great
A great place for groups
There were two large groups in the place with us and from the amount of noise they were making, it seemed like everyone was having a great time
We had a small group of 6, and we had a great time
There's also a parking garage just across the street for those adventurous enough to drive in
I'll definately be going back
Went to Agave with what can only be described as a picky crowd: Atkins-enthusiasts, vegetarians and discerning drinkers
Put all worries aside! Great service, and friendly staff kicking out great food from the smallest kitchen ever! Really enjoyed the experience and will definitely be back
Hope it is a staple of the village for a long time to come!
Start with the ceviche
It is fresh, tasty, and well-portioned
For the main entree, I suggest one of the fish tacos
They won't break your diet, the fish is always fresh, and it is cooked appropriately
I would only bring a child here if they can behave well
Leave the crying babies at home! We have visited Agave three times in the past year
Each time, they recognize us, and greet us with warmth and friendliness
All of the servers are professional and helpful
I always feel special when I visit Agave
I went with several friends on a thurs
eve
We had no reservations
The host was gracious and helpful and was able to seat us within 10 min
The food was scrumptious-not the usual wedding
They really serve the best
This is their standard
It should be everyone else's
The service was attentive and personal
Our server made each of us feel they were all important
I hope Agave remains a presence for a long, long time
Agave has this amazing cornbbeef hash on their brunch menue
It has three types of meat and the meat isn't all groundup
It has big wonderful pieces!
I had dinner @ Agave last Tues
and I had some of the best margaritas I've ever had
Not your typical just frozen margarits
My favorite, the Prickly Pear Margarita, frozen, on the rocks or straight up! Then I had the tuna appetizer one word scrumpitous
Second course, Shortribs, fork tender with the best mole sauce outside off Mexico
And finnally I had the Molten Center Chocolate
It came with a creamy banana praline ice cream it was a good portion so I didn't feel too guilty
But all in all it was great
I like this restaurant very much
The food is great
There is a large selection of many different styles of SouthWestern food
I liked the seafood dishes
The drinks were very good
The environment was pleasant, the people were very nice
If I had an extra hand I would give this place three thumbs up
I highly reccomend Agave
i recently took a trip to New York with my grandchildren and happened to walk by Agave
I went in and was warmly greeted by the the staff
Sat down to a great meal and excelllent margaritas
Service was warm friendly attentive and fun for my family
Would recommend it to anyone looking for a cun casual atmosphere with great food drinks and service
Agave should appear on the best of show on the food network
The host was super nice, the margaritas were happenin', the waitress was personable and the food was the best part
Awesome experience, definately a pleasant dining experience highly recommended
I've been frequenting this place since it first opened and have yet to be anything but overwhelmed by the amazingly creative dishes, efficient and professional service, and classy southwestern ambiance of this inexpensive joint in an otherwise sea of overpriced food
This past week, I was lucky enough to try the pecan crusted trout with chipotle sauce
The portions were big and the price was not! ($18)
As always - the best Marguerita's in town!
you wouldn't expect the kind of atmosphere you are in at Agave when first walking in from the streets of manhattan
The very earthly colored tones pave a scene of somewhere out west in a building made of the very earth
The food was decadent, tasty, well-priced
The service was SUPERB
The frozen margaritas are to die for
Yummmmmmy
Especially the passionfruit
We loved Agave from the beginning to the end, its a great place for Saturday night dinner with few friends
The Mojitos were good, all the appetizers we ordered were good, would definitely recommend the calamari and the ceviche
Would recommend more starters to share and lighter main course, although the main course choices were tasty - the crab quesadillas were the best
Overall a great place to dine with good drinks
My 15 year old daughter and I recently enjoyed dinner at Agave
The restaurant is beautiful with a lovely ambience
Our waiter helped us select from the menu and EVERYTHING was delicious
From the margaritas to the creme brulee, it was a great dining experience
We plan to take my daughter and her friends for a sweet sixteen dinner party
I know the other kids will love the unique style of Agave
Out to dinner last week with a group of 6
Friendly staff happily accepted a reservation (for 10), and when only 6 showed up, they couldn't have been more understanding! Happy faces and cheerful service set the pace for this get away in the city! The sunken dining room- a few steps down- sets the tone for a vacation feeling, it reminded me of Cabo San Lucas! Great blue margaritas as well as additional flavors, I've never seen before
Not the ordinary mexican fare, this has got flare! I'll be back!
The food and ambience transports you from Manhattan's West Village to the Southwest
The bar area is roomy and as inviting as the many choices of delicious margaritas
But don't stop there, the wonderful choices continue in terms of the food
The friendly and knowledgeable staff can help you decide what will satisfy your taste

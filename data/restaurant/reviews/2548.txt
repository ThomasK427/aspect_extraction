Hard to communicate with the staff
If the pizza is fresh it is good, but at what price?
Good halal pizza
A fast food setting and friendly staff
service is fast and good
lots of room
How do I manage this in 150 words or less? Londel's is a Harlem eatery with good vibes and great food
I brought my young European neice and her boyfriend for lunch, 3/9/2006
The waitress was patient and helpful, the food was rich and hearty but with contemporary/intelligent portions (not mountains of food--part of Londel's health-conscious concept), the fried chicken was truly superb, maybe the best I've ever tasted
The ribs were on the dry side
The collard greens were outstanding and the mac 'n' cheese was delicious
The peach cobbler and bread pudding were great
As mentioned by another reviewer, Londel himself came over to our table mid-meal to check on us and to greet, and graciously took photos
I plan to return often, and I'm eager to dig the Fri
/Sat
evening jazz trio one of these weekends
I went on a Saturday after 8 and the place was just fabulous
I completely adored the atmosphere, the food, and the service
Everthing was impeccable
For drinkers, as a recommendation, try their french martini
I was in New York for the Harlem Fringe Festival and looking for a good restaurant in Harlem for dinner between shows
A couple of Harlem residents recommended Londels
The staff was very friendly, we were greated by Mr
Londel himself and seated right away
My green apple martini and my friend's cosmopolitan was delicious and the food was finger licking good
Everything was fresh and served hot
I had ribs, greens and candied yams and my friend had the chicken and waffles
The service was very responsive

The food at Londells is excellent
Especially the macaroni and cheese
The atmosphere is classy and the music is very relaxed and enjoyable
There should be more of a variety if they are considered a soulfood restaurant
The seating is quick, but you may have to wait to be served
I do recommend this place
I've been going to the Hot Pot for years, have seen it's numerous upgrades in decor and have been very pleased with the consistency of the cuisine
My favorite is the Curry Goat, it's tender and spicy without burning my sensitive American palate
The Red Snapper Escovietch, Curry Chicken and the Smothered Chicken are also standouts
The rice and peas are just sweet enough, the plaintains are fried just right and the cornbread tastes like mo! (some more) The Collards are nice and crunchy but need some salt
The one down the service
They always scowl, never give eye contact, say please or thank you and they behave as if waiting on you is the LAST thing they want to do
I get take out and give them nice tips, so maybe they'll realize life doesn't suck, but it hasn't worked yet
Oh well, the food is always GREAT
Famous Fish Market is the BEST deal in all of New York
Where else can you find GREAT food that will fill you up for under $10
00!!
maybe the 8
4 rating was the fact that everybody is conspiring to keep this a secret
great, fresh pizza!
Pretty good jamican food
I recommend the steamed vegetables and oxtails
Bus Stop Luncheonette in West Harlem is a breakfast favorite for value and astoundingly fast service
What it lacks in charm is made up in sheer convince whether you call for delivery (no minimum) or stop by this busy and bustling Harlem spot
The food stand out is the authentic cafe con leche and at just $1
for a Grande it leaves the Starbucks a block away totally in the dust
The food here is delicious and plentiful
Authentic middle eastern food with fantastic flavour
Well worth the trip
Faster service would be greatly appreciated
Ambience is somewhat bland but the food is not, at least
Best hummus I have ever had, and for $5 you get a heaping portion! There isn't a lot to choose from in this neighborhood, so imagine my surprise when I came accross this very inconspicuous Middle Eastern restaurant
The menu is rather limited, and I usually get take-out, but I'm hooked
This restaurant isn't much to look at, but if its cheap, good food you're after without going far, give it a try
Delicious cakes
Highly recommend the Strawberry Cheesecake
The meals are also tasty
I've been eating at Carott top for years
They have the best carrot cake and carrot cookies around town
They also have good breakfast sandwitches and lunch specials
In addition they give you a lot of food for your money
i've been seaching for good fish 'n chips in the city and am sad to say i have yet to find some
the fish here was, by no stretch of the imagination, fresh, and was fried with the skin on just to make it that much less enjoyable
on the plus side, my sister enjoyed the chicken tenders and the service was amazing
I just recently moved to the area and found ths place by chance
Its a great argentine restaurant with a great ambiance
The entrana was delicious
Although there is seating in the back, it's completely dodgey, cheesy and limited
This does not detract from the quality of the food which is fantastic
The selection offered here is extensive and includes sushi, Thai and Chinese food
There is a generous selection of tasty vegetarian food
The portions provided are big enough for 2 meals
I've never been disappointed by a meal here and I usually order from them 4 times a month
I can't say the same for the delivery guys, I've had to complain about the one on the scooter because he was so rude and annoying but after that he was fine
The rest of the delivery guys are alright though
Anyway I'd definately recommend this place
This place is a hole in the wall but let me tell you the food is great, excuse me GREAT! What you get here is authentic Dominican food
You may even bump into a Dominican baseball player having luch
I'm a regular, and in spite of the fact that the newfangled fancier facelifted restaurant/bar on the corner has terrible service (did they make it too big?) - the little cafe/diner side of the restaurant, further down B'way, has that same personal, smiling touch I'd remembered
Excellent club sandwiches and quesadillas - and when you need that late-night burger fix or early breakfast, they're always there (open 24 hrs
) Just don't ask for special orders (they never get them right
) What you see is what you get, and this is simple, classic Cuban diner cooking
Comfort food and sweet, no-nonsense service
All expertly executed and overseen by Milagro, the nicest lady in the world
I have been assigned to a temporary post in Washington Heights even though I am from upstate
Someone told me about about Coogans so I gave it a try
The food is great and the Bartenders are very friendly, it is a very diverse but comfortable atmosphere
i work nearby and am a regular at coogans
this is the nicest restaurant in washington heights
the staff are friendly
the food is good also

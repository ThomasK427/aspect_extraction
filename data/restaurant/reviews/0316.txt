Their pastrami is REALLY good, and the guys behind the counter are great to ask if we wanted our sandwiches with the condiments on the side, and all the condiments came with lidded containers
GREAT JOB!!
I went in for lunch
I was promptly seated and enjoyed great service
The Prix Fixe Lunch menu is an excellent deal
If you get the choice, take the upstairs dining room, as you have some great views for people watching
Centolire used to be one of my favorite restaurants
Not anymore
We went a few weeks ago and it was horrible
The appetizers were average and the food overall was average at best
However, some of the group got the hangar steak with smoked cheese which the waiter recommended
It was one of the worst dishes they have ever tried
I tried it as well and found it equally terrible
We expressed our displeasure to our waiter and got no response
Centloire is now just another over-priced and overrated restaurant
Brought a friend here for his birthday dinner and the manager staff were more than accomodating to my special requests, including the presentation of a dish that wasn't even on the season's menu
Service was impeccable without being at all impersonal, and the impressive wine list, incredible food and subtle ambience made for a memorable evening
It's definitely a pricey restaurant, but I promise that everything about it was oh-so-worth-it!!! My friend and I were *so* impressed from start to finish - I'll come back in a heartbeat
Highly recommended
You may find yourself trying to tame superlatives after enjoying Centolire's diverse culinary delights
Starting with the interior you'll be convinced that you've been transported from the UESide to an authentic Tuscan restaurant that comes with an attentive accented wait staff
Bring your appetite to this culinary experience
Wet your palate with their selection of cheese's and variety of Southern Italian vino's
Move on to a table-side fettucine w/carbonara sauce, truffles, pecorino, (unrivaled throughout NYC)
Seafood: If seafood is more your taste then dive into the red snapper livornese
Skin side pan-seared filet with shallot, tomatoes, green olives and basil served with steamed potatoes
Always fresh never hiding the essence of the seafood taste with a camouflage of over saucing
Suggested dessert: For dessert try the tangerine souffl that when accompanied by a dessert wine or Italian grappa leaves a reassuring imprint that you'll bring your tastebuds back to Centrolire
My husband took me to Centolire for our 10th anniversary
The food was delicious and the staff friendly and helpful
This restaurant is a beautiful
I have suggested friends to go here for a wonderful meal in NYC
I suggest the same to any one else
The excitement of my 10th anniversary combined with the ambiance of the restaurant provided a truly romantic dinner
Eat upstairs
The room is nice, not knock your socks off gorgeous, but adult pretty and appropriate
And the food is excellent
One of those expensive places that are relaxed and comfortable and despite the big tab, it makes you glad that you live in New York and can eat food of this quality when you want to
The restaurant decor and service are fancy, but the food was surprisingly mediocre
The pasta dishes were not very flavorful, and the pasta and sauces did not taste freshly made
The Caesar salad was really mediocre, with poorly flavored dressing
The Parmesan cheese actually tasted like the Kraft brand
Sarabeth's had a better Caesar salad than theirs
Wonderful food and friendly, attentive service makes this place a winner
We were treated well, seated promptly and not rushed out the door
Upscale food and service with a neighborhood feel
Everytime I come to Centolire, I have something new and different
The menu is well designed, and divided into traditonal and nouveau italian food
To top that off, the ambience is comfortable and welcoming
Dispite how some people may feel about Pino Luongo, you can't go wrong here
This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food
Everytime I go there I can't pick anything to eat and not because the menu is filled with great things to eat
I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu
Although the restaurant itself is nice, I prefer not to go for the food
Gaby is one of those restaurants in Midtown that you walk by all the time and simply assume oh it's just another overpriced hotel restaurant
Not true! It escapes the stereotypes of a French brasserie and serves creative, well-executed fare
The olive tapenade served with the delicious French bread is really delicious
The seared tuna served with a patty of crunchy sticky rice is just lovely
Nice room, pleasant atmosphere and the staff is quite efficient
I'm glad I went and will go back again
One of the finest meals we have had anywhere was our lucky experience on an anniversary weekend
Having studied the on-line menu, we had set our hopes on dishes that were unfortunatley not on the menu that evening
We were not at all disappointed, as we were presented with perfectly prepared duck confit and encrusted sea bass that simply could not have been better
The escargot raviolis, and lobster bisque were also phenominal, as was the hazelnut dacoise
Service was perfect
We would not return to New York without eating here again
but pricey, but what hotel restaurant isn't? We wanted a quick late lunch and the service was superb
Food was good, decent, nothing to write home about but they were so kind the sweet potato fries were lovely
pretty room
This is a great place for after theatre dining
It has the atmosphere of a real Paris brasserie
The food was excellent and the staff was nice
I ordered pan-seared chicken stuffed with spinach and dried tomatoes
The best chicken dish I've ever eaten
The atmosphere is very romantic
The waitstaff was also excellent
Maybe a bit pricy, but well worth it
My best dining experience in the city
The Scene Located on a quiet, unlikely corner in Clinton Hill is this neighborhood restaurant of the highest order
The warm interior makes creative use of its former incarnation as a drugstore; the kitchen, for example, is fashioned behind the druggist's counter
Service is friendly and professional
The Food The affordable menu features peasant-like Tuscan food cooked with heart, soul and dead-on execution
Start with marinated sardine "in saor," or tender wild boar carpaccio
Pastas are a revelation, particularly a chestnut lasagna cast with sweet sausage and set against a rich background of herbs
Entrees, such as pork loin with chick peas in olive oil, offer fewer choices, but with no less satisfying results
Desserts consist of a series of homemade cakes and pies, including an alluring version made with rosewater and mascarpone
This restaurant has a couple of things going for it: beautiful interior and a captive audience
I was invited to a friend's birthday dinner and, despite having made reservations, we had to wait while the hostess and the manager argued about where to seat us
It seemed like the manager won out and the six of us were crammed onto a small table, while a larger table in the back remained empty
When we asked if we could move, we were told that the other table was also reserved
It turns out it was
by 3 of the manager's friends
Dinner was uncomfortable
Not only were we elbowing each other when we lifted our forks, but the food was nearly inedible because it was so salty
Instead of staying for dessert, we got the check and went to a bakery on 7th Ave
I'd heard great things, and at first glance it didn't disappoint, as the space is absolutely charming, and the staff very friendly and authentically Italian
But the food was not great
You feel obligated to order several dishes, causing the bill to skyrocket
My gnocci (sp?) was completely average, and my boyfriend didn't like his main dish at all
However, I'd be willing to give this place another try, because it's so popular I feel as though perhaps we just ordered the wrong dishes, or caught the kitchen on an off night

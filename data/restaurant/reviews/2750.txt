I'm a big fan of their East Village location and their pizza
Was not too impressed
In my opinion, the quality is roughly the same as at your local diner
They do offer a twist on some of your typical brunch faves like french toast and eggs benedict, but when all is said and done, it's not THAT great
No beverages are included with your brunch entrees (which has become almost a standard everywhere else in the neighborhood)
Not saying I had a bad experience, but it was just eh
The dining room is cozy though, and seems like a good place to brunch with a large party
Maybe I would have better luck with dinner?
Two boots make a really good po'boy I highly recommend it
Yes there are a lot of kids in this place, but we were kids once too
arrr
Everything would be perfect at this place if not for people
People meaning loud running around lil people
If you want to avoid them, i suggest trying to eat in the outdoor area
Sometimes the waiter/ress is nice, or odd
I've never had a rude one before
This is a very mellow place
I love sitting outside in the summer or in one of the booths in winter
The bartenders are friendly and relaxed and play decent music
The chili kicks butt, as do the po-boy sandwiches and fried calamari
The pizza is very good
Stay away from the gumbo, though - it's gluey
Fun atmosphere: good drinks, fun zydeco/rockabilly/etc
music
Go late, though, if you don't want to be surrounded by out-of-control Park Slope brats being let to run amok
Excellent reliable food and an easy place to takes kids who do not like to sit still
The pizza is thin crust and delicious
The appetizers are delectable
The specials are reliable
Especially good is the catfish dinner and the oyster po-boy
The samosa appetizer and the calamari are also delicious
I had the worst restaurant experience EVER at Brooklyn Two Boots
The waitress and bartender/manager were frighteningly rude and when I complained about an entree, I was told that I was wrong and could go someplace else
And if that wasn't bad enough, I was called a name on my way out! Let's grow up, folks
After patronizing Two Boots for years, I will NEVER bring my family or friends there again
Brooklyn should boycott Boots
Two Boots is in Brooklyn
I am very excited
This establishement seems to be neighborhood-involved (good), overrun by kids (bad--well hell, it is Park Slope)
Solution? This place is exccellent later in the evening or on weekend nights
Get some drinks and listen to the free live music
Yes, it's expensive pizza, but treat yourself for once
This place may be more appealing if you have kids, because you can usually find some here -- unfortunately, not all of them are well-behaved, which makes eating a peaceful meal all-but impossible
Brunches are a strong suit, nonetheless
Really great 7 Oz
burgers
Not the best ambiance, but meat that'll make you drool
Get take out! Great hang over place
It'll be your last date if you have one there
comfy, faux-rustic diner
everything on the menu is utterly dependable, tasty home-cookin'
but frankly, arriving at grand canyon with high expectations on a hung-over morning turns into a huge disappointment with the first caffeinated slurp
but if you don't insist on good coffee, this could turn into your weekend morning hangout
It's a diner--not a gourmet restaurant
But if you want cheap eggs, omelets, pancakes or French Toast, with all the trimmings plus good coffee, fast and straight-up, this is the place if you live in Park Slope
It may not be cuisine at it's hautest, but Grand Canyon does a mean burger and great big fluffy fries
Salads vary, but dinner specials (standard diner fare) are usually more than adequate
But once you've had the burger, it's hard to go back
My boyfriend and I have come here for years
We've been to the other sushi restaurants in the neighborhood and Inaka is the best for fresh, large rolls and fish and an extremely friendly staff
Truly a place where your business is appreciated
It doesn't need to be trendy, the fantastic food and staff are enough to keep people coming back
I have been going to Inaka for a few years now and am never dissapointed
The food is great, the fish fresh, the service always warm and welcoming
For those few of us who like Nato Maki it's one of the few options in the city but so far i find it to be the best
The sushi pieces are fresh, tasty, and presented elegantly
I highly recommend this restaurant for newbies and sushi addicts
The sushi is fine and the people are fantastic
Joanne and her staff are incredibly nice and attentive
It is the kind of neighborhood place where everybody knows you by name after a while, and they know what you're going to order
They would have our kids' dinner ready practically before we arrived
(I ordered delivery and have not visited the restaurant
) I've yet to find a decent Japanese restaurant in Park Slope/Brooklyn Heights/Cobble Hill area
This one is no exception
Bland rice, mediocre fish, unauthentic cooked food
Very disappointed by their fried dumplings, tatsuta age, clam soup, none of which tastes the way it should
If you must have something like Japanese food in this neighborhood, stick to california rolls
The sushi is average at best
Had to walk out after only a few pieces of sushi
Wasted my money
Pay more money and find a real Japanese restaurant (not one with a Japanese sounding name)
And some future advice, don't trust the review of anyone who thinks there is good sushi in Park Slope
Inaka was my introduction to sushi and I became hooked on a food I never thought I would like
Thirteen years ago they were in a different location, but I have been in the relatively new restaurant
Their sushi is always fresh and delicious! The hostess is friendly and wonderful
You will not be disappointed with this restaurant-trust me! Take out is always good also
This unpretentious little corner diner boasts some of the best lowkey cooking in the five boroughs
Unbelievable brunches, a friendly, neighborhood vibe and sassy service make it the undersung glory of Fourth Avenue
Don't miss the homemade sausage
In Short The few window-front tables fill quickly, but most customers prefer not to linger in the nondescript space, in favor of taking their Thai food to go, or phoning in for delivery
The menu offers all the usuals: inexpensive spring rolls, vegetable sweet-sours, pad thai
Deep-fried foods are prevalent, to satisfy comfort cravings
Average food, ate there 2-3 times (I live blocks away) and have no desire to ever go back
T Thai Cuisine is a wonderful place to eat
I am a regular customer
The food is always fresh and flavorful and the prices are extremely reasonable
Service is always top notch
I never have to wait a long time to get my food, so it's a great place to go if you're really hungry and/or in a hurry
My favorite foods include the vegetable spring rolls, Goong Gar Bog (shrimp appetizer) and Pad Kimow Gai or Goong
You can easily spend $30 on a dinner for two and your hunger will be satisfied

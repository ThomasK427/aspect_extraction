A New York institution not to be missed!
My husband loves this place
I have been here twice and have been happy with my meal both times
Another couple we ate with once did not like their entree
The service was very friendly both times
It may not win awards for the friendliness of the service, but the food is excellent and the ambiance is pleasant
Also, even though the service may not be the world's most friendly it is gracious and
they don't rush you
If you are a live or work in the area and want a solid Italian restaurant with well-prepared tasty food and a great, reasonably priced wine list, you can't do better than this
I had a private dinner meeting here and it was the worst place I've ever been
The staff was not friendly at all
They were rude to my guests and me
Everything I asked them to do was questioned or ignored
For instance, I told my head waiter that my client has requested that no cocktails were to be served but beer and wine were complimentary
He refused to do this stating that if someone requested a cocktail he had to serve them! They moved my AV equipment without even asking me
When I told them I wanted the salads brought out early they said no
Also, they walked in and out of my meeting to bring food and drinks to another party
Suffice it to say that you should never ever have a dinner meeting here
This place was horrible, the staff was horrible and the food was horrible
They flat out run a quality restaurant, the owner is always looking to please everyone that walks into the door
The food and service is excellent, these people really get how to run a restuarant
I had a plate of pasta there last week, and the owner actually brought more out for me free of charge because i ate it so quickly
Stop by its worth your while
If you want good service, this is definitely not the place to go
I had to ask them to give us menus and our waiter just kept disappearing
Entree was a long wait, getting the menu for the dessert was a long wait, getting the check was a long wait
Waiter didn't even give us back our change when we paid the bill, we had to ask where the rest of our money was; never been to a restaurant where they keep the rest of the change unless you tell them to
Bad service = not so good food
Had lunch with some colleagues from work
The food was marginal at best, but the service was terrible - slow, unresponsive wait staff
To top off the lunch, the coat check woman lost my umbrella, then tried to tell me that I never brought one in with me
Then another man appeared and asked to claim his coat and she had lost his too! She then told him to take someone else's umbrella (which he did because he said it was nicer than the one he had brought!)
When I told the manager about it, he told me that she had worked there for over 20 years and he had never seen me before and that she would never do such a thing
I reminded him that I just saw her do it and he basically called me a liar
Neither the coat check woman nor the manager ever apologized
The most underrated Italian restaurant in Manhattan by non-suit, non-lunchtime crowd
Admittedly, I first went in my suit for lunch but then decided to go for dinner
The service is excellent, the ambiance delightful, and the food unbelievably fresh and delicious
As someone who travels the restaurant circuit of top Manhattan eateries, I put Cellini in my top 10
As mentioned it is not unknown to mid-town professionals for lunch (good luck getting a table), but now let it be known for everyone else
Threw a party here for my mother and had an absolutely wonderful time
The management is extremely pleasant and very willing to help you with preparations
The food is great as is the ambiance
The second floor is perfect for private parties!
We took over the first floor of the restaurant for a large party (60 people)
While the location of the bar at the front created a bottleneck, the service was thoughtful and prompt, and the food was very good
A pleasure to work with!
Four people from Ft
Lauderdale, originally from New York
We loved everything that was served
We wanted to lick our plates clean
Incredibly wonderful experience
The service was excellent as well
As a regular of some of the best restaurants in NYC, I can honestly say that this isn't one of them
Being a cool place isn't enough for this restaurant whose food looks nothing like the food in the photos
The food is dry, the seafood is terrible and the service is horrendous
Our scallops were not just tough, but were bad and smelled horrendous
Don't tell the waiter that, because they will insist that the slightly bad smell is part of the enjoyment of their place
I've not met anyone who knows food in NYC that loves this place
If you like really ugly dcor (yes, it has black lacquer finishing) and really bad food, you'll have a great time
If you love great food, try nobu down the block
By far the worst restaurant experience I have had in Manhattan in my 3 years of eating well- the service was rude and completely inattentive
The waiter poured our wine into my water glass, rolled his eyes when I asked for a new water, and definitely didn't offer to comp the wasted glass of wine
The food was horrible, and not what we ordered
The prices were astronomical- $500 plus for 4 girls to sip wine and share orange chicken?! Never again
An interesting place
You don't order off of a menu, you just tell the waiter what your feeling like and they go off of that
The food itself is pretty damn good, but its not Chinese food, if you will
The Peking Duck was above average, the roasted glazed pork was out of this world
My friend who I was dining with, a cuisine connoisseur, asked for hot sauce to spicen it up a bit and the waiter basically told him Sir, the taste is unique! No hot sauce, and walked away
My friend was definitely offended
The Ambience is nice, but very loud at night
They make good drinks
I reccomend this place for those who don't mind a dent in their wallet and want a unique place to eat, but not to those conscious of value
So it's not the greatest restaurant food-wise, or even the greatest Chinese food
And maybe it is fairly expensive (for Chinese food, at least)
And so what if you can't figure out what you've been billed for? Read the review before you go, and you'll have a good time
Is it bizarre that they don't itemize the food? Yes
Is it that big a deal? If you think so, don't go
It's a fun evening out with people, with really good food
If you're uptight about the bill and give them a hard time ordering they'll probably charge you more! I'm not one to waste money, but if you have a general idea of what it will cost then just go with the flow and enjoy
Lastly, the food's really good
The best? No, but then again, you don't have the same ambiance at Shun Lee either
It's your choice
The most over hyped restaurant in NYC
First of all
what kind of chinese restaurant has all white waiters
Thats like going to an Italian restaurant and having all Japanese waiters
The whole bit about letting the waiter order for you is probably the dumbest thing a human being can do
It's like going to a car dealership and letting the salesman pick out your new ride
The waiter brought out the same dish three times during the meal
Don't get me wrong
the food is alright but not worth the price
There was not a single dish that I can remeber that sticks out in my mind as fagetaboutit kinda good
I'm never going back
I went to Mr
Chow for the first time, even though i read most of the negative reviews on this site, but still decided to try it out
I did not expect to have THE best meal in my life
Food was GREAT !!! The waiter had chosen the dishes for us and i am glad he did so, i doubt we would of chosen these dishes ourselves
Food was fabulous, impecable service (the waiters and hostesses) were extremely pleasant , friendly and very helpful

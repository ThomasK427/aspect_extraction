The service was great and we had the tasting menu, which I reccommend if because it allows you to try more on the menu
Also reccommended: the Danube Cocktail
In NY, Tribeca is an area known for some culinary delights, and Danube fits comfortably ably in the mix
Danube has always been among the tops among NY restaurants, and it is neither pretentious nor stuffy - it is rather comfortable
It is mainly Austrian, but does have other European/Continental influences
Another service they offer is a tasting menu - something a lot of high-end NY restaurants are now providing
This is a fantastic option for those who either don't know much about the food, or those with a commitment problem
Danube also provides a corresponding wine flight, where each course is accompanied by specifically selected wine
A few final thoughts about Danube: they give you enough food to make you full when you're done, and, like most in it's class, it's a restaurant where you only go when money isn't a major concern
I went here last night for my fiance's birthday and they were the best
The gave us so many complimentary items, we were stuffed
When we sat down they offered us flavored champagne (complimentary), ravioli appetizer (complimentary), an extra dessert, a birthday dessert with candle and some cookies/biscuits with our coffee
Then on the way out she got a bag with some cake/bread in it for home
The only thing missing was a limo waiting outside
The best!
Danube is by far one of NYC's top ten restaurants
I recently celebrated my 1 year anniversary here
In making my reservation I notified the Maitre D that is was my anniversary and that I wanted a quiet, romantic table
From the moment we walked through the doors to the moment we left, the wait staff made every moment the most romantic surreal experience

ithey helped captured a moment that will last a lifetime for us
Thank you Danube!
The food was out of this world and the sommelier recommended an excellent Austrian wine
Very attentive waitstaff, lots of little extras that the kitchen sent out, a wonderful dining experience!
The atmosphere alone is enough reason to give this restaurant a try
The interior is all designed by Gustav Klimt and makes for some of the most luxe wall art i have ever encountered in a restaurant
The food is fantastic, Gourmet comfort food and has gotten progressively better over the past year, as did the service
My favorite dishes all involved squash of some kind, which i would not expect to love
Definately worth a try, but try a weeknight and a romantic evening
Everything certainly lived up to the hype of quality and atmosphere
My only gripe is that I felt rushed and the bill was handed to me before I asked for it
Dessert was speedily served as I still had a beer to drink and this is after I requested a few extra moments until it arrives
I would expect this from a 'lower end' restaurant, but not there
In Austria that would be considered an insult
Really superb and creative food
The ravioli are tremendous, beef cheeks divine and (believe it or not) the Wiener Schnitzel the best I've ever had
Portions are fairly generous and the staff brings out multiple little bites and treats throughout dinner
The room itself is gorgeous, but go late, as the room becomes more romantic as it empties out a bit
My only quibbles are service - which was confused (we waited 10 minutes for menus), and the wine list, which is over-the-top expensive
The cheapest glass is $12 - absurd given that the menu itself isn't THAT pricey
Danube is a terrific restaurant
It is tops at everything: food, decor and service
Perfect place for a sumtuous, romantic evening
I have been taken to many fine dining restaurants (Jean Georges, Picholine, March, Veritas etc
) and this was one of the most beautiful evenings I have ever had
The service, the food and the luxurious decor all contribute to a stunning ambience
It's expensive, but undoubtedly worth every penny
If you want a special evening for two, this is definitely the place
And I loved the chocolate truffles in the gift bag at the end! Highly recommended
Our dining experience at Danube was top notch
The service was impeccable and food was out of this world
I started with the diver sea scallops and then the braised beef checks
The beef was so tender and flavorful
My girlfriend had the ox comsomme and then the the sturgeon
Both were excellent as well
Another person in our party had the tasting menu and I thought it was nice that they let one person do the tasting menu alone
Usually restaurants will make the entire group have the tasting menu
The staff was very attentive, courteous and knowlegable
All and all a TOP dining erxperience
They even gave the ladies a gift bag as we were leaving
HOMERUN! Danube definitely makes my top 3 and I have the fortune of dining out quite freqently
The only downside is that it is a bit pricey but IMO well worth it
Food was ok
Atmosphere is also nice
However, what sticks in my mind is the snobbish attitude of all the staff from the hostess that seated us to the aloof waiters with attitude
The hostess sucked her teeth at us as she was seating us and the waiters looked at us like we were garbage
And we were a party of 12, each paying about $160
With all the terrific restaurants in NYC, I can do without the attitude
My girlfriend and I went for 03' V-Day, and the service was abosolutley wonderful, very intentive, and the food was
wow
Wonderful flavors, and the menu's were well put together
The atmosphere was a absolute 10! The only con if there is one is that the meals are very expensive! I spent a easy 260 without looking
But of all the meals I've spent over 150 for, this was very well worth it!
Incredibly sexy, classy atmosphere
Subdued but energized
Goulash was a little fatty, but everything else sublime
Can linger for hours
I recently went to Danube and I was very impressed
The restaurant is very beautiful and romantic and it has a nice bar/waiting area with great cocktails
The main dining room is very beautiful and intimate
The food is no less amazing! I chose two items from the Austrian menu and they were both outstanding
I had the cheese ravioli with mushrooms as a first course and I had the beef cheeks for my main dish
Both dishes were very flavorful and beautifully presented
I also had the caramel tart for dessert and my boyfriend had the cheese plate, both of which were great
The service started out a little rough, but it got better and I feel it may have been that way b/c we are younger diners
I will definitely go back to Danube and it has become one of my favorite restaurants
I love the food at this place
The food is always outstanding -- the sauces are in particular incredible
The wine list could use a cut in prices and an increase in selection -- for example, the markup on a bottle of Domaine Drouhin Pinot Noir is nearly 200%
The service is very good but seemed a bit hectic
The dining room is gorgeous and comfortable
The prices are through the roof, however, but you get what you pay for
After some initial difficulty getting my scotch ordered the service was excellent
My wife and I spent three hours at Danube savoring the food and the experience
We found the service to be prompt and concientious, the head waiter was knowledgeable about the food and gave very good advice
The food was interesting and delicious for the most part
The only portion of the meal that I wasn't wild about was the schnitzel -- a bit bland
Everything else was excellent
After three hours of dining and multiple courses and drinks our bill came in at a very reasonable amount and I was happy to pay it
Perhaps not the most romantic place for an anniversary -- nonetheless a solid experience

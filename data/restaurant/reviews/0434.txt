The pork buns are pillows of sweet-savory excellence
I also like the unusual sesame pancakes, kind of a chewy/dry flatbread, very nice
Soups are also great
If you calculate quality based on enjoyment for cost, this may be one of the best places to eat in NYC!
I heard good words about this place from just about everybody, but it was impossible to find it on directories
Apparently this restaurant didn't have an English name
The Chinese name of the restaurant, is a name, but next to it prints Fried Dumpling, which doesn't describe the Chinese name but rather a description of the food they serve
Anyway, this little place is just great, soybean milk, regional sesame pancakes, not to mention the big dumplings! Its reputation has been spreading by word of mouth, and it's all true
Eating in isn't a good plan but there's no better lunch for $1 in New York
If the weather's nice and you're really hungry grab 10 well-sized dumplings for $2 and walk down the street to the park for an impromptu picknick in the middle of Chinatown; but don't forget to drizzle your meal with the tasty soy-vinegar sauce first
If dumplings are a favorite food buy 30 frozen for $5
Gently thaw and pan-fry for a great snack, meal, or last minute h'ourderves
Found this hole-in-the-wall place through Citysearch and I'm SO glad I did
So is my girlfriend! We were STUFFED and only spent $6
50 for the both of us and the food is great
The place is clean, too! Not too shabby
The perfect spot for a quick snack
I've even bought 10 orders at a time to serve as appetizers at a dinner party (cheaper and tastier than whatever you were going to make)
Straight forward and exactly what its name suggests, Fried Dumpling is a great place to get a hot meal when you've only got enough money for a subway fare
The Scene There are exactly three small tables at this tiny hole in the wall, but for food lovers on a budget, it's heaven
Five juicy, tender dumplings ring in at $1, so two people can eat themselves silly for under $10
The two condiment bottles on the table provide all that you need: a tangy blend of vinegar and soy sauce in one, and spicy chili sauce in the other
The Food The fried or boiled dumplings come in either pork or veggie and are handmade with a fragrant dose of chives
But don't overlook the other tasty Shanghainese treats: da bing (plump, sesame-encrusted "pancakes" that are steamed first and then fried); fried round pork buns; tea eggs; perfectly savory hot and sour soup; congee (a thickened rice and red bean soup--ask for sugar); and, to perfectly complement your meal, all the fresh, hot, high-protein soy milk that you can drink (try it sweetened)
Since I live in the neighborhood, I go here a lot
The price is cheap - 5 dumplings for $1
You get a good show
It's entertaining to watch them make them
They're also good tasting! There's no room to really sit and enjoy there, but there's a park half a block away, so take them there and bask in the sun
For a dollar, i couldn't be more satisfied
You get 5 fresh, steamy fried pork dumplings for a buck! They were really delicious, just like my grandma used to make them, filled with pork and chives with the juice that tends to run down your chin and onto your shirt
You can eat at the counter, but theres not much room at all, so just walk half a block down to Columbus park to eat
And good luck trying to ask them questions- they only speak Manderin and a bit of Cantonese
Best dumplings in New York
Even during the blackout, they were cooking them on a bunsen burner! Don't bother trying to ask for vegetarian though, unless you speak Mandarin
The dumplings here are great
It is always hard to find a seat and the selection is not that great but it is one of the few places to get lunch for only a buck
The food is great also which you would never expect for only a dollar, Yes you read that right only a buck
You get five delicious dumplings for only a buck
You can also get two pork buns for a buck also which are just as good
They also offer soup which depends on the day but as the name suggests just stick to the dumplings, which are made on the premises and are not synthesized by some big evil corporation
The Scene Want some bling bling with your blini? This Columbus Circle caviarteria supreme has seafood swank to spare
The boutique purveys the same succulent smoked fish by which the ridiculously luxe restaurant claims its fame, and similarly doesn't skimp on the accompanying upscale chill
This shop isn't for the easily intimidated, but what did you expect? You're buying caviar, not chopped liver
The Food The shop boasts a truly decadent selection of foie gras, pate, pastries, savories and other pricey delights, but still, the real standout is Petrossian's trademark smoked salmon
The silky, sumptuous cuts and king's-ransom caviar are what has kept decades of New Yorkers in hock
But fish heads on a budget know to nip into the shop's cafe for a surprisingly reasonably priced light lunch
Great place a bit pricy, but well worth it
Order Apps first and dont even bother with Main Course
You have to try double Choc cake
The Scene There aren't many eateries in New York where you can play Galaga, Centipede or Ms
Pac-Man while downing franks, but this place keeps the '80s spirit of the block alive
A mixed crowd sprawls out among the checkered tables and counter stools, eyeing posted specialties like the Spicy Redneck ("makes you want to marry your cousin") or the more demure root-beer float ("One straw or two?")
The Food Dog choices are limited to the standard Crif (an up-to-snuff smoked frank), the snappier, bolder-tasting all-beef New Yorker and the veggie, delivered in signature combos, ranging from the satisfying chili dog to more eccentric styles
Once you've abandoned yourself to the lipid-rich, brain-dissolving Chihuahua--wrapped in bacon and topped with avocado and sour cream--you may be ruined for any other 3am meal
Fries are somewhat bland, but the shakes and egg creams add flair
Crif Dogs are highly delicious under a variety of circumstances
A low-key date with your girlfriend? Yum
Late night post-drinking snack? Yum
Hanging out with a kid? Yum
It's a fun environment and the dogs are SO good
Crisp, tasty, and with excellent toppings of all kinds
I recommend the chihuahua myself
Bacon, sourcream, avocados, and a hot dog? Together? Love
so you don't eat it again
i dont know what some people who rave about this hot dog are talking about
this without question is one of the worst hotdogs i have ever had
a street vendor has tastier hot dogs than these crif dogs
dont even mention the fries which taste like dehydrated potatos
if your curious about all these novelty dogs go ahead
personally i say save your money
4$ for a bad dog is so not worth it
all i have to say is they have the most fun and friendly people working there and the veggie dogs tastes so damn good, at first i thought they fried it in lard or something
awesome place
and the cheese fries are also the best i've eaten
the veggie dogs are too good to be true! very cool place
Crif Dogs are delicious
I am 120% addicted, and I live upstairs from the restaraunt!!! The Classic crif dog w/ everything is delcious, and if your in the mood for a normal fran get the classic New Yorker
The chili cheese fries are amazing a large is def enough for two people
The crowd is always cool, no attitude good movies playing, and Miss pacman!!!!! Its East Village Heaven!!!!!!!!!!
This place has the place hot dogs! I would recommend the Chihuahua
I don't normally eat hot dogs and normally I hate them but this hot dog was phenomenal
Highly recommend this place
This place is terrific - one of the few places that still feels like you're in the East Village
There's no pretension to hipness and the staff aren't rude or condescending
The fries are great (I get them with a side of temptee) the hot dogs are amazing - (love the crif dogs which are fried, but sometimes i go for the new york, which are more like gray's papayas), and yes even the burgers and other items are good
These guys really know how to do hot dogs - taking inspiration from legendary Jersey Hot Dog joints Callahan's and Hiram's and melding them together with East Village coziness
At a street fair in August last year, they had a stand where you could eat your fill for a donation
It was like heaven
Sometimes there's a line, but it's always kind of worth it
There are really no greater pleasures in the world than going into Crif Dogs with a friend, getting a couple of Pabst cans, and playing Ms
Pac Man while you eat Hot Dogs
The dog creations are incredible
Make sure you try the Good Morning Dog - which is a hot dog wrapped in Bacon with a Fried Egg and Cheese on Top
Or the spicy redneck which is another hotdog wrapped in bacon, with jalapenos, cheddar sauce, and onions
Crif is really the best
Been sort of a hot dog connosieur for a while and this place definitely rates up there with the best
They offer a wide menu of dogs but for a purist it comes down to the New York dog and the Crif Dog
Of the two I would suggest the Crif Dog
Get the special with two dogs and a soda

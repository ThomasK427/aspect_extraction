The first time I ordered masala dosa, the server brought a plain dosa and suggested I start eating
He said the potato filling were being prepared - he'd bring it when it was ready(saw the same thing happen to another couple)
People familiar with this cuisine will understand how absurd the suggestion is
Its like ordering spaghetti w/meatballs only to be told to eat spaghetti while the meatballs are being prepared
Not wanting to write this place off, I went back
This time our entrees arrived at a gap of 8-10 minutes which when you're hungry is a long time
The last time, it was a repeat performance of the first time
I left thinking the awful customer service and the dazed servers are too much of an annoyance to ever go back
So if you're looking for a pleasant dining experience, this is NOT the place to go
The Scene Draped in elegance, this lavish hotel tavern is fashioned more for upscale dining than drinking
Velvet-backed chairs, a communal banquet table, and still-life paintings set in gold frames recall Baroque opulence, while plush leather booths and the eye-catching custom chandelier--a silver, crystal-leafed vine twinkling with tiny intertwined bulbs--modernize the special occasion space
Despite overhead digital art and an amethyst bar, the less whimsical lounge suits casual travelers with flat screens and low seating
The Food The new American menu also pursues an antiquated-but-updated decadent design
The signature starter rejuvenates classic French toast with a deliciously unsweet combination of truffle fondue, goat cheese filling, and sauteed mushrooms
The juicy hangar steak gets a touch of old New York, with its size of potato knish hiding tender short ribs, while charred steak-sized servings of lamb frite arrive with humdrum shoestring fries
Rich dessert crepes ooze warm cheesecake, but the Belgian waffle banana split is pure, caramelized extravagance
We tried it in March, and while we weren't thrilled with the food the staff was amazing
The decor is odd, but comfortable
Are those car tires wrapped around the columns? Regardless, the cozy booth seating kept our attention on each other rather than the decor
The wait staff were very good
The waiter suggested a very nice wine
Kudos to him
Now if only the food were better
I had the heretofore raved about French Toast appetizer and while mine wasn't the buttery mess that another reviewer mentioned, it wasn't great either
Nor was the seafood panfry
It was good, but the clams, shrimp lobster were all overcooked and tough
The mussels and scallops were quite tender
For the money, the entrees could've been better prepared
Maybe the kitchen had a bad night
I'd return to try other items on the menu, simply because of the amazing service
I read all the reviews you're reading now, and the place sounded fabulous just as you're probably thinking
So, I went for Restaurant Week and have to say it was really disappointing
First off, the Restaurant Week menu was terrible, but that's no real surprise (restaurant week is a sham, if you ask me)
My friend and I ordered off the regular menu, and the food was entirely disappointing
Very average fare for such a highly touted place
To make matters worse, the decor is terribly drab and I felt like I was at the Yale Club or something
Finally, to kill the dea,l was the cost - exorbitant
Don't waste your time, and definitely don't waste your money here
This was by far the worst meal Ive had in Manhattan
The french/toast goat cheese appetizer was greasy, cold and bland
The steak was fatty and tasteless except for the charred exterior
I made a reservation after reading the rave reviews here and now suspect that the proprietors have given themselves such high marks
Maybe hotel patrons and tourists find this food fabulous but all others should stay clear
My boyfriend and I visted looking for a quiet, romantic meal and were very pleased
The food was delicious - we started with calamari - light, moist and perfectly suited with a spicy mayo sauce
I got their shellfish panroast which was incredible! Rich and flavorful without being heavy
My boyfriend got the special- swordfish - very tasty
I don't know what happend with previous service qualms, but I would say if I had to rave about one aspect of our experience, it would be the staff
We were greeted at the door, our coats were immediately taken and we were promptly seated
Our waiter couldn't have been more helpful, from suggesting wine and specialty entrees to checking on our drinks while still allowing privacy
You should expect a bit steeper prices, but I totally felt I got my moneys worth
A first class establishment without being pretentious
Went here to celebrate a Birthday/Valentine's day
We had reservations and the Maitre D forgot about us -- after we waited an hour and then went up and asked about our table, it was laughed off as a mistake and then we finally got a table
We had to wait about another hour for our appetizers, as there was a snaffu in the kitchen
The late appetizers were accompanied by cold bread
The food was just mediocre
The appetizers were luke warm at best (which is not good for goat cheese/french toast)
My husbands duckbreast was nothing but fat and my filet had A1 sauce on it for flavor
I would not return to silverleaf, as our special occasion was ruined by mediocrity at best
I was shocked at how atrocious this restaurant is, considering the price
The heretofore high rating is
extremely suspect, let's just leave it at that
The food seems like some kind of sick joke - bad, banal food dressed up to look good
But come to think of it, not even all that dressed up
The french toast with chevre appetizer was sopping wet with butter and bland to boot
It was accompanied by a tedious pile of unappealing, buttery mushrooms
Everything in fact seemed doused in butter - a heavy and cloying odor of it hung in the air with the terrible, too-loud Euro-electronica
The steak was gristly and accompanied by soupy mashed potatoes
Again, butter everywhere, no flavor, no freshness
This is a big-time ripoff joint
My husband and I went in Jan 06 and really were impressed
The food was delicious- especially the french toast appetizer
My husband had the steak and loved it- I had the duck breast which was great
They were very knowledgable with their wine list and the service was impeccible !! I commented that I loved the odd shaped coffee cup and they wrapped one up in a pretty bag and gave me one before leaving
I would highly recommend this restaurant and I'm looking forward to visiting again
When I heard we were dining in Murray Hill at a restaurant located in a hotel, I was skeptical at best
However, I was truly impressed with the flawless service and food at Silver Leaf
We were a party of four and seated in one of their divinely comfortable curved leather booths
I highly recommend ordering their Long Island duck entree
We dined on drinks, appetizers, and entrees for a little over three hours and never felt rushed
Our server, whose name escapes me, was very informative and courteous without being at all overbearing
It was just the type of experience you hope (and expect) to have at a fine restaurant in the city
This exciting new addition to the Murray Hill's fine dining destinations, Silverleaf Tavern restaurant is located in the newly renovated Kimpton's 70 Park Avenue hotel, formerly Doral Park Avenue
Kitchen staff's talented creations along with the serving staff's absolute dedication to the perfect service make this restaurant a truly a hidden gem
Some of the signature dishes include the the famous East Coast Shellfish Pan Roast, Fried Oysters with Rock Shrimp and the Tuna Nicoise
You can't go wrong with the Silverleaf tavern for a first date, quiet business meeting or a casual dinner
Their front bar and lounge area gives you the chance to relax and wind down before you could enjoy the marvelous culinary creations and try some interesting drink mixes like the PoMtini
FINALLY!!! A decent place to dine in Murray Hill
Chef Kevin Reilly's very clever menu has won my heart over and over and over again! I keep going back as i want to try everything on the menu
But I surrender fully to the Westfield Chevre French Toast
YUM! The winelist boast of phenomenal varietals
Excellent staff
It's great to call a place and finally talk to people who knows what they are talking about
Kevin Reilly, you and your food rock!!!!
Dining in Murray Hill can be a challenge
so I was thrilled when Silverleaf opened this year
Delicious food--lots of raves already about the french toast-but I'll echo those for the the scallop appetizer, duck confit salad and the shellfish panroast in lobster bisuqe
One day I want to try SL's bottomless wine option
but I'll wait for something to celebate

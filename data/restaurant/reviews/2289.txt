a must
Alora
The food is now just acceptable- good, but not what you'd expect at these prices
The crowd used to be a mature fun group- but now instead of babycarriages at the door there are wheelchairs and walkers
And the drink prices are inexcusable-even Bice doesn't charge $8
50! Too bad - this used to be a great, reasonable and lively neighborhood spot- now it's just mediocre food and a tired old crowd
This place is the BEST
Try the grilled fish dishes and pastas
The service is very good, too and they have a HUGE wine list
Very good place on the Upper East Side to get some food and enjoy a drink
There's a small bar in front and seating for about 30-40 in the back
Prices are reasonable although they vary (Coors Light Draft is $3 while a Bud Light Bottle and Amstel Bottle is $5)
Menu has a decent variety and isn't very expensive
Draws a mid 30's and older crowd as well as a number of families
There are 3 tv's, two by the bar and 1 by the back of the restaurant
Bathrooms are unisex and located by the kitchen
Staff is very friendly
I love Luke's
my girlfriends and i come in all the time before we head out on a friday or saturday night
not only is the atmosphere great, but you can't miss the two hotties behind the bar
glen and chris
but careful girls, we think they're both taken! FYI
great food, but not low fat
go for the fingers!  credit cards NOT accepted!
After rave reviews that this little bar and grille was different than all of its neighbors, I found out out the truth: it IS different
they do not accept credit cards for payment
I do not care how good their burger was (it didn't come with fries; they are extra), I do not need the hassle of hitting an ATM and carrying cash
After all, I know lemonade stands manned by six year olds that accept credit these days!
Then we had the calamari no tentacles
Thats right when questioned about the tentacles, the waiter replied that he does not agree with the chefs taste as well
Then came the linguinie carbonara and rigatoni
I'm talking blandtastic here
Rigatoni not puffy, served on a cold flat plate, besides an overwhelming wine taste, nothing to scream sophisticated and special, or even Italian
Then the carbonara, were talking no cream, served with a teaspoon to twirl my pasta, good ham, a hint of vegetable, but dry and not creamy
Tasted like diet food
To be honest this is the crowd which doesn't like taste
Or perhaps looks the other way because each of their doctors has told them to lay off the rich foods
When i asked the runner, where are all the Italians, and what is this (gesturing at my food) he laughed
Small and Comfortable place, went their with small group and had an great time, the food is very good, and the service was excellent
The best part of it all was the fact that we started dinner at 9pm and stayed and talked until past midnight, with out any rush
I hope you enjoy this place as much as we did
ps
best veal in all of ny!
I stumbled across this restaurant one day and I am so glad I did
it is by far one of the best places I've ever eaten
The staff is phenominal-very friendly and attentive, the food is outstanding, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting, but sophisticated at the same time
The prices are incredibly reasonable
not cheap, but a great deal for a nice evening out
I recommend this to anyone who wants a great Italian meal in very nice surroundings
You will love it!
We were walking around the Upper East side looking for a nice restaurant where we could eat outside and stumbled upon Due
It is a great place
The service is probably the best I've had in a while
There was only a small table available outside and three of us
The manager found a way to fit us
The specials were described in great detail and the waiter had a great wine knowledge
They offer half portion pastas which, in combination with a salad, was perfect for me
Try it out!
Not only is it a great neighborhood Italian place that I will frequent very often after my meal last night, but the owner/manager makes you feel like you've eaten there 100 times before
He's clearing tables, chatting it up with patrons
The guy clearly knows how to run a sucessful restaurant
It shows too, because the place is always packed, but worth the 15 or 20 minute wait
Chicken Scarpariello was awsome as was the walnut salad w/ baked goat cheese
Highly recommended
Excellent service, excellent food (try the linguine alla vongole [clam sauce] -- it's to die for, or the shell pasta with sausage [can't remember the Italian name])
I'd stay away from the calamari b/c it's definitely straight out of a microwave
No credit cards excepted so bring cash
First of all, the service at this restaurant was fabulous - very attentive, and my water glass was never empty! Both my companion and I enjoyed pasta dishes that were perfect in flavoring, texture and presentation - fresh pasta, if I'm not mistaken
I did not partake in their wine selection, but they have a good-sized selection
I would highly recommend this place - casual, friendly and affordable!
food and atmosphere very declasse'
Owner not friendly
Place very noisy, very clastrophobic
I would not recommend it
i went here with two friends to celebrate my birthday
i hadn't been to Due in 2+ years and it was WONDERFUL as usual
while their menu doesn't change that often, our food was delicious and cooked perfectly
the service at due is first rate, with attentive waiters and ernesto, the host, who is helpful, unobtrusive and can recommend a wine to match your entree
our meal was fantastic and i would definitely go back! (even if it is on the upper east side)
In Short This outpost of the Village's famed thin-crust pizza parlour is a cozy neighborhood favorite
The menu features pastas and salads, but the pies--particularly tomato-cheese with just a few fresh and meaty toppings--are the thing
John's thin, charred crust is a Gotham trademark
This location also has a garden
Just spent Memorial Day weekend in NYC
My husband researched ahead of time what pizza joints would serve up some great NY pizza
John's did not disappoint!! The favorite part for all of us was the crust
crispy, yet soft
We were staying in Times Square and didn't know that there is a John's right there but were glad we took a taxi to the 64th location
The atmosphere in the courtyard out in the back was cozy
We loved Lauren, our waitress as she was friendly and helpful and gave us other recommendations of things to do and see in NYC
Visit John's!!
I like all of John's Pizza locations and this one is no exception
I like the neighborhood feel to this one and the food, service and price make for a nice night out
With all the good pizza in NYC, I recommend John's as one of my favorites
this was the worst pizza i've ever had delivered
it was cold and tasteless
toppings were skimpy
calamari was soggy
adding insult to injury, the pricetag was 50% more than the place i ended up calling afterwards to deliver the same order
What a great place to eat and relax with your family and friends! The garden in the back is cozy and comfortable

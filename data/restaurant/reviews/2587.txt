Nothing fancy but eclectic and appealing with enough evil eye ward off charms to protect all in the restaurant forever! Definitely worth going if you want some Turkish food
The staff was also friendly
The impression we got was of Turkish comfort food
Nothing sophisticated
Kebabs and couscous and salads, mainly
But for where it is, and how much more expensive restauarants up in the West 40s can be, and for something maybe a little different without being scary different, you could do worse
Chinese food in America are prepared sweeter than they are supposed to be in order to appeal general American public
This restaurant doesn't do that
People who loves sweet and sour and greasy Chinese food may not appreciate their dishes
Even though the price may look little more expensive than other Chinese food restaruant, this restaurant is well worth it
I usually go there with my husband and order 3 dishes or so, and bring the left over back home, and eat it over the next three days
Still delicious
This is one of those places you can't belive the reviewers keep passing over
It's so fantastic and obviously very authentic
The other Sichuanese restaurants in NY can't hold a candle to this place
Try: the dan dan noodles, sesame noodles, kung pao chicken or shrimp (the dish originates in sichuan), mao po tofu, spicy shrimp with capsicum, or any of the dishes in the front of the menu
Also good: cabbage and fish soup -- it's not spicy and should be eaten after your spicy entrees
Note: Hello, this is not the place to get an eggroll or ask for crunchy noodles for your soup
It's amazing how ignorant some people can be even about the concept of regionally authentic food
There are not that many She-Sen Chinese restaurants in NYC where use real sansho peppers - which is amazing and addictive spice! If you like spicy and exotic taste, then you have to try their dishes
The dishes are little bit overpriced, but I have to say that it worths it! Great for large group so that everyone can share various dishes
Is comparable to Our Place or Shun Lee
The seafood dishes are especially good and the seafood is FRESH
I recommend the shrimp with asparagus or the crispy pepper scallops
The Kung Pao -- believe it or not -- is really good, too
The sauces that the food comes in has a depth of flavor that could only be attained with fresh ingredients and a knowledgeable chef
If any of these sauces came out of a plastic jug, I want to know where to buy that jug
As for eating in, the space is cramped and service is so-so (though the interior is not unappealing)
The beef dish my wife ordered was a little salty
For lunchtime, I thought the price was a little high and that you can go to other places that offer lunch specials
Ate there for lunk, the chicken was the lowest quatlity, all dark meat, lots of fat and cartilidge, gross
The friend rice had no flavor, color or vegetables
the spring roll was tine (2 inches),
and to top it off, i asked for a ice tea, got a sprite
This place is cooked up some real deal Szechuan style Chinese dishes
The Kung Pao Shrimp and the Fatty Pork Stir Fried are some of the signature entrees
The Dan-Dan Noodle is pretty similared to the one in Szechuan
My only regret is not ordering the Bai-Jo (Chinese Moonshine)
One warning
This place is not cheap
Again when is a quality place ever cheap
I've eaten here about 20 times in the last 6 months, and this place is very clearly the winner
Another reviewer said forget the others, and I must agree
I've been to all of them
The 3 pepper chicken (spicy capsicum) is ethereal if chicken can be
The tea-smoked beef, the pork chili vinaigrette (accompaniment) are remarkable to no less extent
Something so mundane as hot and sour soup is well worth having
In short, I have had no greater consistency with 9+/10 rating performances anywhere else
This is the best Chinese Restaurant in NYC!! Forget about ShunLee, forget about Our Place of Shanghai, forget about Joe's Shanghai, forget about Grand Szechuan
if you want authentic Chiense cuisine done the way it is done back home at a good price, this is it!! This place gives you the most authentic Szechuan Chinese food in town!!
I loved this place-great szechuan food!! The spicy fish is good here!! Also abalone was great
I love their Dan Dan noodles too
This place is a must try
I'm going back next week!! It's great for large groups, and prices aren't chinatown but worth it, because it's really quality that you get
Few years ago we found the restaurant, since then we are regulars !!! our family, friends and even business partners just loved it
Excellent service, excellent food, and the price, the best
Dont miss it!
I know something about Chinese food, being that I'm Asian
Nothing tops Wu Liang Ye
Hands down
I know that some Chinese do not like anything other than those prepared in Chinatown in the authentic manner
However, Chinatown can be a bit too authentic for some
Wu Liang Ye prepares the best dishes using probably one of the best ingredients (no mystery meats, no stale veggies, etc
)
Clean, quality, and tasty food
space is a little tight
so call and reserve first
If so
go to Torre di Pisa
its is a very disappointing experience
mediocre food, served by indifferent and arrogant staff (with the exception of one supervisor) which comes in at a around $100/head once you have had some wine
who wants to feel grateful to be served at that price!
the best aspect of the place is the chairs
so take my advice and don't go there
I've been visiting NY for the last 15 years and its the first time I've felt compelled to write a review
NY has so much more to offer
This rest
was recommanded by a hotel
When we first entered the decor was nice
But the waiter was not attentive and he forgot our order/request twice
The food was just so so, which made the price seemed too high
Visited for rest
week, 2004 and found rest
to be high on ambience;however food/service severely lacking
Prix $30
00 per person !  Our entree was a bowl of spiral noodles ($1
00  at store) with minimal meat sauce overtop
That was it
I think we got a salad/dessert - I don't recall
When wait staff found out we were there for the price fix - attitude in the gutter towards us and service very, veeeerrrryyy ssssllllloooowww
I've been to NYC 10+ times - too many other rest
to waste time here - location is good - but I suggest a taxi to eat elsewhere
I was looking for a romantic place, pre-Broadway show
This is a very nice restaurant
The food was good, and so was the service
We had the Steak Fiorentina for two
Just make sure you both agree on how you like it done! It's not inexpensive, but they do offer a fixed price meal that I'll definately try next time I go
My friends and I ordered from the set menu of $20
The waiter attitude changed to worst
In the appetizer, there was a choice of soup, which some of us ordered

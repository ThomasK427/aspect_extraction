The hostess, Josie, informed us that the cafe is a business and we should make room for other customers
If you want to spoil someone's night, take them to Anyway
Went this Saturday for lunch, b/c it looked cute from outside and the crepe-laden menu sounded promising, if pricey
For the lunch prix-fixe menu, we were treated to a mesculin salad with balsamic vinegar dumped all over it, followed by the absolute worst and unseasoned borscht in the east village
The kicker was the chicken crepe, which is $14 on the dinner menu
It consisted of boiled, flavorless, dark meat chicken -- with bones -- and canned mushrooms, wrapped up inside a pre-made rubbery crepe that I could see our waitress reheating in the microwave
Do they even have a stove? Never, never ever again
Great Place to go for food in drinks with a friend of a large group
This is one of the few places in Manhattan where you can get full menu of vodka infusions
This is not a place to go if you plan on ordering a bottle of wine, but the sanghria is ok
Atmosphere is great and food is pretty good
The food is not supposed to be russian
It's a blend of russian french
Be sure to order an appatizer to go with the vodka
While service may be a bit slow, that's fine as long a the vodka is on the table
Coffee/deserts are good
Also great place for late at night or on hollidays when everything is closed
The menu for this place seems inviting but the food is not quite up to par and the wine is truly awful
The ambience is good and actually we had a very pleasant time there but couldnt help noticing that our platters had a rather thrown together appearance
Not great, not bad, service was amiable and moderately efficient
The jazz singer who showed up at 9:30pm was much too loud for the space and we were effectively driven out by her melodious yells
Definitely worth a visit but not on the AAA list
I have been coming to Anyway cafe
This place has great ambiance and always just the right number of people
There is always somebody there, but u never have to wait too long for a table
Food is great and service has its upsides and downsides, but it definitely adds to the flavor of the place
lived in the east village for two years, and had one of my best dining experiences here last night
the cranberry vodka infusion was great, the music was perfect, and my potato pancakes with wild mushroom caviar was pretty amazing
i recommend this to anyone sick of the annoying, new york pretentious restaurant scene
oy! we thought we'd found a cool russian cafe
frigid might be a better word as to how we were treated by the waitress/manager after she realized we were not untrained in russian cuisine
the cold borscht was water-based, there was no kefir or buttermilk base to it
the gravlax was served in raggedy chunks
the russian black bread was brown
the chicken crepe took more than a half-hour to make and tasted as though someone had dumped a bottle of wine on it!
I have been at the place about five times
Wow for the food and drinks
Service sucked
Last time we went there, we might've overdone it by bringing 12 people
Yet with the table reserved they had one person in the kitchen cooking for two parties of about 10 people, besides regular clients
We spent between 1,5 and 2 hours just waiting for our food
And at the end waitress' comment to a was: THE SERVICE WAS OKEY
That is with 5 steps to the bar which had 3-5 people at the most it took her at least 5 minutes for each drink to bring to our table
The Scene The 50-seat dining room is elegantly--if sparsely--appointed with rich leather banquettes, hand-blown glass vases, a wisp of greenery and small pastel prints
In all its sleekness, Veritas exudes a cool modernity
A striking stainless-steel-topped bar looms near the entryway; a substantial business crowd and an army of oenophiles fill the dining room, which is patrolled by no fewer than four sommeliers on any given night
The Food New American cuisine in the purest sense, drawing freely on an array of ingredients while taking a fundamentally classic and French-inspired approach to technique
Chef Scott Bryan's sharpest strengths are searing and roasting
He also has a knack for creating excellent stocks, which form the foundation for first-rate sauces
Bryan exhibits a light touch with seafood-- longtime signature dish, sauteed skate, shines
After reading the reviews I came with high expectations and was not disappointed in the least
The well publicized wine list was even more extensive than I'd heard
The food was terrific
Blue Fin tuna tartare and pork appetizers were great
Lamb entree was not flashy but very worthwhile
A trout special on this particular night was off the charts
Its a special occasion type place with prices to match but definately worth trying this place for a celebratory evening some time
Great short ribs and of bottle of the best northern rhone wine i've ever had
If you haven't been to Veritas you are missing a wonderful eating and drinking experience
The food was excellent from app to dessert
The space is stark yet comfortable
The service was attentive but not overwhelming
A MUST GO FOR WINE FANS
I spent 30 minutes with the wine bible
Just wish i could afford 10% of the list
O well i go to art galleries a lot and can't buy anything there either

Went here for 1 year anniversary last night
Decor was nice, wine list was phenomenal and sommelier recommended an excellent if pricey bottle
The appetizers were exceptional and everything was going well (meaning my wife was having a good time)
After we finished off 3 appetizers, the waiter asked for our dinner selection
My wife asked for more time, at which time he said our table was re-booked so we had to hurry it up
We were genuinely hurt
I will never ever go back to a place which has no respect for the people paying their salaries
Also beware the pre fixe menu, its really not
Two of the three appetizers were charged extra
Food doesn't compensate for lack of class
Though we were seated 30 minutes late, thanks to a couple of glasses of comped wine and the amazing food and terrific service, I had a fantastic night and cannot wait to return--a great value--the portions were qute large and luxurious!
I took my wife there for our first wedding anniversary, the place was very romantic, we had a little corner table which was very private
When plates arrived at the table, they were beautifully arranged, the taste was just as beautiful as the plating
The creamy potatoes with ricotta cheese was amazing with the prefectly cooked rack of lamb
Veritas is the ideal dining experience
The space is handsome, the wine list extensive, the staff knowledgeable, helpful and polite and the food is excellent
I can say comfortably that Veritas is one of the best restaurants in New York
One of my favorite places
I always have an excellent time
Great food, wine and service
Always perfect
No mistakes!
I visit Veritas whenever I'm in NYC [based in UK] and it never fails to hit the spot
For the reviewer that was disappointed by the phone service I suggest try again
I called from the UK only yesterday and despite changing the reservation three times they couldn't have been more helpful

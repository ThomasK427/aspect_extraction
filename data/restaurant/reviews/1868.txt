The Food The menu features a wide array of Hawaiian- and Asian-flavored appetizers and entrees
Steamed vegetable dumplings, fried calamari and other choices can be combined in a pupu platter perfect for sharing (and keeping the cocktails from getting the best of you)
Entrees include seared pork medallions, steak au poivre and various burgers
Standouts among cocktails are original concoctions such as the Marion and the Suburban, as well as perfectly executed classics
Happily surprised that this restaurant was not at all crowded, even empty on a friday night, i didn't know what to expect
The menu offered a 19$ prie fixe pre-theatre 3-course meal including appetizer, main course, dessert, and wine! what a great deal
the Exploded ravioli (main course) was amazing, as well as the short rib
the desserts were FAB - i wouldve paid $19 just for the chocolate chocolate chocolate dessert!!! the drinks were great - best white sangria i've ever tasted, the wait staff was personable, and ambiance was hip and cozy
the food is very gourmet and decently priced, and very underrated!! i'm surprised that not many ppl have found this place, esp with all the cool activities they offer like fashion shows and fondue! i highly recommend this place, with friends, a date, whoever!
I've been meaning to post a review about Marion's since I booked the adjoining Marquee Lounge for an office holiday party back in December and I can't say enough nice things about the restaurant, lounge and staff - from the ultra-quick turnaround on the event proposal and the flexibility on menu selections, to the very skilled and handsome bartender (Dan) who agreed to work our party on his night off and the equally attractive restaurant manager (Todd) who actually wound up serving appetizers to our group! The party was amazing and I was the star of the evening for having found this local gem
I not only had a fantastic time that night, but I've been back time and time again for the exceptional food, happy hour drink specials, pleasant atmosphere and amazing staff
A friend and I were looking for a fun place to go for cocktails, keeping in mind we might want a place with the option of food, as well
That's how I stumbled upon Marion's
Am I glad I did! We had a total blast
The cocktails are yummy and the service is super friendly and excellent (as mentioned in several of the reviews)
We ended up ordering food, too, and were not disappointed
This place is an absolute gem
The vibe is excellent
Very fun, but not one of those places that takes itself oh-so-seriously
I will definitely be back and have already told several of my friends what a great time we had the other night
Great drinks, great food, fun people
What more can you want
I was pleased to find that the positive reviews in citysearch were right on the mark
I have lived in the city for a long time and very few restaurants have aged as well as Marions
Everytime I go i find that they have made something better, (just like the neighborhood) They opened a homey lounge nextdoor where the drinks are even better and they are served fireside
When i first started going to Marions the food wasnt great, but now it is definitly one of the better restaurants in the neighborhood
The food is creative but really down to earth and understandable
I love it there
Honestly, one of the best dining experiences I've ever had
As soon as I walked in the staff made me feel comfortable and at ease
Our waiters were polite, friendly, and eager to help
Food was absolutely amazing, highly recommend
I left the restaurant beaming
Great for special occasions, a romantic date or a place to dine at the beginning of a great night out with a group of friends
In fact the last time I was there was a few weeks ago where a beautiful woman was proposed to by her boyfriend
He got down on one knee and a hush fell over the entire restaurant
It was wonderful to watch and I felt privileged to witness it
Amazing food at unbelievable prices
The atmosphere is both elegant and fun and you can experience a whole range of ambiance throughout the night
The service is excellent and unpretentious and the drinks will blow your mind
Great for dates or bring all your friends!
My wife and I have been going to Marion's for years and I have to say it just seems a bit better everytime
Especially the last few times
The food was inventive without being silly
The martinis were on the point as they have always been
The servers are always so helpful and great at making you feel comfortable
When we can't decide where to go to dine, my wife and I always say lets go to Marion's
I was at Marion's a number of years ago
It was jam packed but the food was fabulous
The menu looked ordinary but the food was seasoned and cooked perfectly and served piping hot
I finally made it back there and plainly put, it sucked
Starting with the drinks, I ordered a sidecar but was told they were out of cognac
hmmm
Then I ordered a lemongrass martini that had no hint of lemon grass at all, muchless the lemongrass garnish
I then ordered the filet mignon, without the blue cheese Of course it came with the cheese and it looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile since the cheese was melted all the way down to the plate
I sent it back
It came back 2 minutes later and I was told they just peeled it off
It still tasted like blue cheese
I had reservations for 14 people for my birthday for 9 pm
When I showed up, there was a party who had been there for 5 hours already and refused to leave
As soon as the clock hit 9, we were informed that the offending party could not be kicked out, but we would be seated asap
Within 5 minutes, there was a bar full of free appetizers waiting for our party that we never requested
We didn't get our table fo another few hours, but anything anyone asked for was instantly given to us free of charge - hundreds of dollars worth of free drinks and food, never anything but a smile from the bartender
I've been back multiple times since, and will be there for my birthday again this year
Made a reservation five days in advance, no problem, left phone number, no problem, confirmed reservation on day of reservation, no problem, showed up for reservation and saw a sign saying closed for private party
The Bartender CONFIRMED we had a reservation (only competent person in the place) and said we could still fit in dinner before the closed event
We were seated AND THEN was told it was closed for a private party and they WOULD NOT have enough to serve us
NO OFFER TO MAKE IT RIGHT NOT EVEN AN APOLOGY
I have friends that are regulars here but will back me up on not going back
SHAME ON YOU MARIONS!
I went last week and it was okay
Nothing to brag about
The Ceasar Salad was classic with anchovies :)
The wine list was good
It's small, loud, not really a place I would select again
If I am on that street and not too hungry I would go again
More of a bar scene than a restaurant
I lived in this city for all of my life and have been in dire search of restaurants with delicious food and satisfying prices
Marions is one of the few places where i can go and enjoy an amazing meal with great service and prices that doesnt make my heart skip three beats
The decor brings back vibes from the early days of newyork city, with the flavourful soul of new meets old
The menu is diverse giving you a mouth watering temptation to try something new
And if you are a burger kind of guy or girl, marions has an amazing burger that will leave you full but oddly wanting more
Yes, i am a usual, and that is because the service, food, and soul of the restaurant is phenomenal
As much press as Marions gets for being glam, campy, or whatever
I've been going for over 14 years because it simply exudes downtown class
It was well ahead of the Martini/Cosmo craze, making excellent old school drinks because it was timelessly New York, not to be trendy or hip
It's continental American cuisine has never failed, (the Steak au Poivre rocks) not to mention you feel like your dining in a part of history
This place is the tops
I just had a birthday party there and it's fortunate that my friends were more interested in drinking and talking then eating
The service, though friendly and cute, was appallingly inept and the food came out randomly and slowly
The fondue was good but the entrees were mediocre to horrible
Have a drink at the bar
the atmosphere is nice
It's a shame they didn't have their act together because it could have been great
Just don't plan a meal there
It's not worth the hassle
I can't get enough of Marion's
Martinis are delicious and deadly
I normally drink strong drinks and end up wobbling out of there after 2 drinks
Pipertinis are amazing

The food came out quick and was nicely prepared
The taste was exotic as backed up its dcor
We left a special tip for the busboy
You wouldn't know this place was in Bklyn by its interior decor
It's got funky, fun furniture and a round bar at the front, which is convenient for those waiting to be seated and be prepared to wait for a while, if you don't have reservations
The appetizer salads almost drown in their Thai sauce, which is on the spicy side for those of you that might not like spicy foods
The main courses are very on par
The foods are inexpensive and good, with a pretty large selection
Most people might not venture out into Bklyn when they have a sister restaurant on 2nd Ave in the city, but try it at least once to see for yourself
The service is very attentive, almost too attentive at times, they seem to whisk the plates off the table the second you put your chopsticks down when you are done!
Great room, incredibly cheap and fast
The appetizers are better than the main courses
If you stick to the basics you can do okay, do not get fancy
I'll go again, but I live in the area
You can find better Thai food in New York
I post this review as a response to others, who negatively rated the service at the Sea, where trendy Manhattan decor meets Williamsburg's inexpensive, yet GREAT food
I visited the place twice within the last year, and both times I loved it! We were promptly served by the waiters with wireless iPaqs to submit orders
I though it was impossible to get such appetizers as a seafood salad or a seafood soup for about $3, but the taste and portions won't let you have any doubts
Please, name me places in a city where one can get a properly served wine for $14/btl! We had great Sauvignon Blanc served in an ice bucket, a minute after it was ordered; and that all at a packed place that can sit about 300 ppl on Sat night! The food, service, ambiance, decor and PRICE, would definitely make happy the most skeptical reviewers
THEY DON'T HAVE HIGH CHAIRS AND WILLIAMSBURG IS THE NEW HIPSTER MOMMY HOOD
SEA DOESN'T HAVE HIGHCHAIRS OR BOOSTER SEATS
I UNDERSTAND THAT CHILDREN SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RUN WILD BUT WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN SEA DOESN'T WANT TO CATER TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
JUST GET A HIGHCHAIR! WHAT'S WORSE, A CHILD IN A HIGHCHAIR OR ONE RUNNING AROUND IN THE WAY OF THE WAITERS/CUSTOMERS
HATE GOING TO A RESTAURANT WHITH CHILDREN RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE LIKE WILD ANIMALS
I got to sea around 9pm
I was told there would be a 45 minutes wait, so I gave my name and went to the bar
To get 2 drinks took 35 minutes, I then went to check back I was told it would be another 25 minutes, so I went back 2 the bar
I then went back 30 minutes later I was told it would be another hour
Definitely never take a date here you will look like an ass, its so ridiculous the people are rude, they are so busy they dont care if u wait 30 min or 2 hours
The food is ok but definitely not worth the BS
I went there about 6 months ago too with a party of 9 with reservations we still had to wait 1 hour for a table
Safe your money ulcer for another place
Decent food, good prices however the service leaves alot to be desired
Language barrier and somewhat of an attitude
Sea is a refreshing take on a trendy restaurant that is packed with good-looking singletons in their 20s
It is busy so make reservations
The bar is nice; bartenders are not attentive
The food is okay but, prices are incredible, under $20 for most specialty entries and under $10 for most standard Thai dishes
Decor is modern and slightly mismatched which makes the restaurant cozy
Music is pumping so don't expect a quiet dinner
Overall, great place to go with a big group of friends who are looking for a good time
This is laid-back place where people are hip but not pretentious

As for the previous entry that complained about having to pay to have a cake served: IT is standard for restaurants to charge $2 a plate unless you buy the cake from them; I find the complaint totally off-base
I've been to Sea several times and I just went for a birthday dinner
I brought a cake w/me and the staff told me that in order for us to be able to eat it there, we'd have to pay an extra $2 PER PERSON - WHAT A RIDICULOUS POLICY! My friends and I often go out to dinner to celebrate birthdays and other special occasions and we'll always bring a cake
I couldn't believe that we had to pay extra money just to be able to eat a cake we had bought elsewhere
I will NEVER return to Sea for any celebration
However, it is a nice place to go for a laid-back dinner
The place is nicely set up, tasty food and reasonable prices
Don't expect to carry any kind of conversation during your meal - the music is very loud, especially if the DJ is in
I went to Sea Thai the other day
I've been here many times before and the experience just gets better
The atmosphere is so adorable w/ the flowers and the pond
The food is amazing
Appetizers (spring rolls, curry puffs, martini shrimp) are very tasty and inexpensive
Try the Black Noodle dish and anything in their garlic sauce
For dessert get the banana spring rolls
You will not be disappointed! Definately worth the trek to Brooklyn!
Nice decor with bad service people were polite but service was slow
dishes piled up before they took them away
The food was salty for the most part and not even a bowl of rice can save it
The appetizers were much better then the entres so my sugguestion is to forget about the entre and order many appetizers
But if entres are a must then do order the muscles, pat thai or the duck in curry sauce
Prices were good here as well
The editorial review doesn't come close to describing this awesome find- just a few stops from Union square- the food was fresh and very good, cheap cheap wine and all around good times
Definately check it out, or the other locations in manhattan (they also own spice on 10th)
Okay this place is fantastic! I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first- complaints about service are fair
The barman are incredibly ignorant, in fact I have never been able to get a drink at the bar and I have tried a few times! BUT if you go on a weekday or off-peak service is ok
I went on a tuesday night and service AFTER being seated was very good
Food is excellent, the place looks great,its a great place to take a date!Prices are unreal-2 of us had a 3 course-meal and drinks for a total of $42
SEA was amazing! I was taken on a first date, and the food was so good that we couldn't stop talking about it
The Barbecue SEA was so tasty and perfectly barbecued
The Martini Shrimp were just gorgeous
I've got to admit, the appetizers beat out the entree but maybe it was what I ordered, the dark SEA fish, kind of saucy
The ambiance was cool, futuristic, and efficient at the same time
The sheer size of the restaurant amazed me since I am usually a Manhattanite
I will definitely go back to this one even though there is a closer one in E
Village, the Williamsburg has a special feel
I've been here a half dozen times and always enjoyed the delicious cheap food and cool modern atmoshere, but starting with my first visit i've never ONCE failed to be disappointed with the service
Not only is the food always incredibly late but drink orders, and waiters, invariably go M
I
A
And then incredibly, when I had decided this was just part of the charm, on my 5th or 6th visit the waiter brought me the wrong bill and credit card while they gave my credit card away to another customer- who then left with it
For good
I realized what was going on before the staff did and I brought it to the managers attention, who then proceeded to ASK ME FOR ANOTHER CREDIT CARD
I had to insist they comp my $30 meal so that I could go home and cancel my credit card
My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night
From the moment we walked in, we fell in love with the place! Great music, great atmosphere, and reasonably priced food! And the decor was to die for!! We will definitely frequent this place
While not all of the dishes sparkle (the southern soup I had was just sour liquid), most are very tastey, and the prices are more than right! Get a bunch of apetizers and noodle dishes and share everything
This atmosphere is creative, but spartan, and an elevated DJ booth rules over all like hoisted diety
Unfortunately the tables around the pretty centerpiece pool only hold two people
Strangely enough the most interesting feature may be the restrooms that show footage from hidden cameras around the restaurant
Quite a wait on weekends
Take people to Sea and show them how cool you are!
Beautiful place, food is great, the music is awesome
Attracts a trendy crowd of casual dressed
I had to wait for 2 hours on a Sat night, but it's totally worth it
The foods excellent and the drinks are awesome! After being advised on going on Friday nights instead of Sat, we tried that and we only waited 20 minutes

The owner came over and said eh, its just old fish, there is nothing to worry about, as if serving old fish is par for the course
Then the chef came out, grilled me on how much I had ingested, and offered me some websites on skate
(An ammonia odor is an indication of spoiled or improperly handled skate; it should not be served)
She said, when you come to a restaurant like this, part of the experience is that each fish is different
Sometimes they are old
To be fair, we were not charged for the skate
Four of us went to Ici before a BAM show
It's very cute
The menu was nicely sized with five small plates, eight appetizers and seven entrees
The portions are generous, specially the short ribs entree that my husband ordered
The food was really impressive
But the best was the service
Our waitress was pleasant and available
Highly recommended
Four of us went to Ici before a BAM show
It's cute but VERY loud
The menu was small but tasteful although the portions are tiny
the short ribs entree my husband ordered should have been called short RIB
The food was unimpressive
But the worst was the service
Our waitress was pleasant but unavailable
Our wine, appetizer and entrees took FAR too long to be delivered and we sat with empty glasses and used plates on the table for most of the meal
When my three dining companions received their entrees, we waited patiently for my salad and soup for over 7 minutes until one of my friends walked back to the kitchen to get my salad himself
No apologies, no please have dessert on us, no nothing
And worse, we missed the majority of the show we wanted to see due to the service
Not recommended
We went there for Brunch this past week end and really enjoyed ourselves
The food was really good, specially the Frittata and the French Toast
Service was quick and efficient
Nice wine list
Certainly the best Brunch option in Fort Greene or Clinton Hill
was it the storm or is their service usually that horrible? i had to ask for my side of bacon atleast 3 times and did not get it until every morsel of my main dish was done
After reading great things about brunch here, I went with a few friends
First off, there were very few options for brunch, just a couple egg dishes basically
The waitress recommended the vegetable fritatta, so several of us tried it
In short, it was disgusting
It tasted like a luke-warm soggy sponge! There are much better places in the area, so don't go here
I had read the review in New York Magazine, and thought that perhaps I was going to a delight in a not-so-great part of the city
I had to convince my wife that traveling to Brooklyn wasn't such a bad idea, and that this place had a great review
Frankly, the place is underwhelming from start to finish, from little dinky tables to cafe-quality waitresses who didn't know their menu let-alone pairing questions
The food was boring as can be, nothing original

and frankly, the fact there were cooks in the back and not chefs has something to do with this
I read about the restaurant in New York's Magazine top 101 restaurants
the space is great
the smell of the fireplace throught the restaurant gives it a great intimate touch
the kitchen is exposed, which I liked as well
the cured sausage and their truffle mushroom soup was a nice start
I opted for the special fish of the day
it was perfectly seasoned and cooked
great portion as well, enough for one or if you're watching your wallet, a great share
my girlfriend had the japanese beef stew
she found it to be her favorite dish of the nite
the server wasn't overly attentive, but the food and the space made up for whatever she lacked
can't wait to try their brunch menu
we'll both definately be back
This restaurant shows from the moment you walk in the door that the owner and the chef both have yaers of experience
julie (the chef) delivers food that is always seasonal, fresh and well thought out you can tell she care about food and the people that eat it
this is one of my fravorite restaurants in new york
don't stop what your doing
I have eaten at ici about 7 times and the food is always excellent
My favorite thing about this restaurant is that it uses fresh, local, seasonal, organic produce, meat and wine
The ambience is cozy and charming and the service attentive and warm
They have the best outdoor seating in Brooklyn, and are now serving amazing summer cocktails
Maybe not easy to understand because so simple
I guess we are not use to real restaurants anymore
The best organic ingredients cooked at the last minute served by a friendly staff in a quiet and relaxing setting
Great expereince in a restaurant is that simple
Thank you ici
We keep going back to ici for a year now, and still love it
The food is amazing for the price
Where do you find in Brooklyn organic food at this price
Entrees average $17 $18 and Appetizers $8
Natural wine list, elegant dining room gorgeous garden
Everything is so simple and to the point
No chichi
Just quality simplicity
I wish there were more restaurant like this one
THe restaurant and staff are great, do not get me wrong
I wanted to like this place, I really did
But whatever expectations I had for the food, they were not met
It was as if everything that came out was missing something, or not quite there enough to be fabulous
My fellow diners with me concurred
It's not the worst place, believe me, it's a gorgeous place, but I'm not going to go there for the food
Wine and atmosphere, sure, but the price on the underwhelming food is not justifiable
I'd be a fool for paying what we did again for what we received
Live and learn
We go to this restaurant at least once a week - the food is always consistently excellent, unique, tasty
The menu changes to offer the best dishes and the specials are amazing
Great spot for brunch - their garden is quiet and peaceful, the best croissants in the New York area by far
It gets loud on the weekend nights inside since the restaurant is small and popular - definitely worth going for any meal
Great service, relaxed ambiance
went last saturday night with my husband
His pork shoulder with grits was so tender and delicate
I got a beautiful portion of wild pike with cabbage and carrots in a mustard horseradish broth that was truly amazing for $19
The waitress was so knowledgeable and nice
We spent $122 (2 appetizers, entrees, bottle of wine and two more glasses of wine) for a truly great meal
Really unexpensive for organic food
went last night with my husband
His pork shoulder with grits was swimming in fat, not gravy

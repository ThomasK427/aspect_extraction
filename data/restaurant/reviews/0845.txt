Food arrives quickly and piping hot
The price is just right
Check out their nightly specials
In all fairness to Purity Diner, I've only been there once, but that was enough for me
Just to have something as simple as pancakes and coffee on a Saturday morning was an ordeal in this overstuffed corner diner
They seemed more concerned with packing people in than serving them
And I'm from Jersey, the motherland of diners, so I know busy from chaotic
Maybe I got them on a bad day, I don't know, but the service, the food, the sardine-can atmosphere just made the whole experience unpleasant
(Which reminds me -- the place seemed popular with the stroller set -- the necessarily indulgent Park Slope attitude toward screaming kids is in full effect here
)
HIgh prices are worth it! Don't know why the 5th Ave
one isn't listed here--sit down and get their tuna pizza yummmmm
THe best
My 17yr
old son introduced me to KiKu and I have been hooked ever since! They make a great Philadelphia Roll and have a new Soft Shell Crab Roll that is amazing
And the delivery time is definitely true to their FAST DELIVERY moto
Clean place, friendly staff, and an interesting creative variety of rolls
If you're trembling for a sushi fix and are on a tight budget, you should definitely drop by for a roll or 2 or 3
I recommend the Spicy Crunchy rolls
I tried the Sweet Potato roll last time, but wasn't as impressed
But hey, not everyone can be perfect :)!
Over year ago, I was dismayed by Amins over-priced, flavorless food and rude waiters inappropriate behavior
Like a fool, I recently returned
Again, I was stunned by Amins waiters belligerence
Amins waiters ignored requests for water and condiments, as if we were greatly inconveniencing them
One waiter demanded us to order appetizers, causing us to say no thanks several times
Entrees were served at different times and some were not prepared as requested
Most entrees were bowls of orange, sugary soup with little meat
Unapologetic about any mistakes, Amins waiters caused us to feel as if we were trapped in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm
More authentic, affordable Indian offerings are available throughout NYC
While even run-of-the-mill Baluchis chain restaurants deliver passable Indian food at reasonable prices, Amins bad-mouthed waiters serve a few hunks of chicken in Chef Boyardee sauce
I haven't eaten at the restaurant itself but order take out and delivery all the time and the food is always excellent and quick
I even convinced them to delver at a friend's place on Eastern Pkwy and Franklin which isn't in their service area
Particularly amazing is the saag paneer and just about any lamb dish
While I know nothing about the service while dining in I can say that while perhaps a bit brusque at the door, their food is unequaled in Brooklyn and reasonable in terms in of price
There wasn't anyone else in the restaurant, so I should've recognized that as a sign of things to come
When I requested a specific beer on the menu, the waiter said they were all out of that one and kept pushing the only available beer, which I didn't want
After taking our order, he left in a huff, muttering in Hindi to a fellow waiter
After bringing out our soups, he immediately brought out our appetizers, and then muttered some more in Hindi as he walked away
Couldn't he have waited 5 minutes for us to finish our soups first? Couldn't he have placed the appetizers in the middle of the table, rather than the corner of the table, so my elbow wouldn't be getting greased up by samosas? To top it off, we found a couple of chick peas in our rice pudding, the only available dessert item
Lovely!
I lived around the corner from here and it was always my first choice when thinking about a place to take my friends, not only because of the proximity but the atmosphere
Only problem, don't go hungry you always have at least a 30 minute wait for food
The food is not always the best in taste
You can get far better food elsewhere
The drinks are not very pricey and the bar staff are usually friendly
Then for a really good time you can go downstairs for the dance party, but be warned it gets crowded down there on the weekends so expect to dance in small corners and wear light clothes
I wouldn't recommend dining there
The rice was hard and the jerk chicken wasn't very tasty
It's a mixed crowd anywhere from mid 20's - 40's (maybe even older)
You can always expect good music when you go to the dance downstairs
a mixture of reggae, soca, rb, and hip-hop
Ladies expect to sweat out your hair if your staying long; it's very hot and crowded
Men are respectable
nobody has ever grabbed at me for a dance
Drinks are good, strong and fairly priced
as far as caribbean cuisine goes, this spot is top notch
the doorperson doesn't hassle you much (if at all, other than the routine check), you can move comfortably in the place, there's a nice space downstairs to dance
(note: watch the drinks - they're powerful
) the waitstaff is a bit on the slower side, but the food will make you forget that
it's not a romantic place, but it makes good room for the vibe
I go there many times a year and it's good some nights it gets too crowded but what can you do, the staff is courteous the prices are decent
Good People, food and drinks
i have tried bagels from all parts of brooklyn,but this place tops them all
Its a bit off the beaten track but well worth the trip
easaly the best in the world {try their everything bagel with the homemade vegtable cream cheese
Heavan}
YOU HAVE TO TRY GERRITSEN BEACH BAGELS LOCATED RIGHT ON THE CORNER OF GERRITSEN AVE EVERETT
THEY ARE THE BEST YOU WILL FIND IN BOOKLYN !!!!
Polite and attentive service
Caribbean influenced menu was a value and very tasty
Had the Coconut chicken, which I would order again
The atmosphere was very relaxing and the bathroom was the nicest I've ever seen
Planning on going back soon
you definitely receive your money's worth at cafe Dore
It is perfect for the romantic at heart
The ambience, with soft, mellow and varied music playing in the background sets the tone for the evening
Guy's you can bank on getting a thumbs up on your first date for this excellent choice in dining
Wonderful tea service, great staff, elegant ambience, unpretentious
the best place to meet friends for an afternoon chit-chat on Court Street
In Short Boomerangs, Aussie flags, kangaroo portraits and faux aboriginal art honor the homeland's wilderness, but Outback delivers a polished version of rusticity with varnished blond-wood booths with matching wainscoting and casually uniformed waitstaff
Besides more than a half-dozen cuts of steak, diners can pick from large-portioned entrees like ribs, chops and shrimp or chicken "on the barbie
" The Bloomin' Onion, a large onion dipped in batter and deep-fried, is an appetizer with a following
Over the past year, my experiences at the Outback have gone from good to mediocre to awful
This place is going downhill, fast
After a recent visit, I vowed to never again eat there
The service was unreasonably slow (burgers took over 45 minutes) and our waiter couldn't care less
When we politely asked if he knew when our meals would be ready, he said he would check for us
Ten minutes later: no burgers and no sign of our waiter
Then we spotted him
carousing with some female employees at the hostess desk! He didn't budge untill our meals were already finished
Our food was delivered by another leery young waiter who couldn't keep his eyes off of my assistant's chest area
When we complained to the equally leery manager, we received a Bloomin Onion Card, which we promptly deposited in the garbage on our way out
This place is just lovely
Its in abit pof an unusual spot being that it is on the second floor of a twos tory shopping plaza right next to loehmanns but it doesnt ruin this place one bit
The decor inside the restaurant ismoody, exotic, and cool
The flor to ceiling front wndows give you a view out onto the the bay and in the summertime their outdoor cafe is the bets for outdoor dining in brklyn
After the decor gets you the food will reel you in for good
Fresh food, served quickly by extremely attentive and professional waiters who go out fo their way to actually serve the fod onto your plate
Try the pepper crusted tuna with wasbai mashed potatoes ad anything else on the menu and ouw ont be dissapointed

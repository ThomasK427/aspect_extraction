But, it's a good way to see what other people have ordered and everyone seemed to be having fun and no one really minded
Just don't try to get up to use the restroom
The service was nice and helpful
I'd go again, but I'd try their other location on the upper east side
I've heard it's better
Make reservations or be prepared to wait
My husband I were in NYC for a long weekend from Orlando, FL
We loved the food so much we went there twice
once for dinner, once for lunch
Both times we were not disappointed
Very helpful waite staff great menu! We definately be eating there on our trip back to NYC in May
The hostess was overly friendly, but she didn't have as bad an attitude as what I've read of other reviews
I felt the wait staff was timely and attentive
the food isn't the best, but the sushi rolls I ordered were good
the prices are a bit much, but what do you expect for a touristy spot so close to Times Square
Two co-workers took me out to eat at Ruby Foos
We ordered it all
appetizers, main courses and desserts
To say the food was AMAZING is underrating it
There are no words
I haven't eaten this good in a long time
The courses were PERFECTLY timed and the waiter was very helpful
The dessert was the best part
We split one - it came in one of those little Asian boxes w/ separate compartments
I can't wait to go back!!!!
The staff's incompetence and attitude eliminated what little interest I had for this restaurant
After asking for my credit card number to make a reservation for a Sunday evening, the Rude Fools could not bring up my reservation on their computer system when I called to confirm the night before
I talked to THREE different reservationists, because the first two women just conveniently put me on hold after listening to my complaints
I didnt even bother going to this place, and from what my friends say about their food, I'm not missing much
I concur completely with all of the negative comments in citysearch about RFs attitude
Don't go to Ruby Foo's if you want anything close to real
If you want kitsch, whimsy, American, it's great
Food isn't bad at all, but again, I wouldn't vote for the Best Chinese category
Had dim sum and sushi at the bar
The sea bass was to die for-it just melted in your mouth, the crab dim sum was tasty and the spicy tuna was up to par
I wish I had had a chance to taste more of the many options on the menu
The bartenders were very friendly and helpful
I would definitely go back, get a table and take it all in
We go there at 7:00 so there was a wait to be seated even for 2ppl
We decided to stay at the bar and hjust have some apps instead
They had a great wheat beer and even had an orange to put in it
Most places give you a lemon or nothing
The chilean Sea Bass was great! The rest of the food was average (Spicy Tuna Roll, Crab dumplings)l
I liked the place
Would like to go back for a full dinner, even though it is a little pricey
Just a great restaurant
I may not ever go to another
Food selections too many to count and the service makes you want to stay until closing
I give this: 10 CLAMS !!!
I was convinced I did not like sushi until I went to Ruby Foo's
Their fusion style of preparation is a great introduction to sushi for those who haven't tried it (or are convinced they don't like it) and a new dimension for sushi lovers
Ambience is on the edge of being 'theme', but without 'going there' completely
This is a wonderful place to bring guests from out of town who want a fun atmosphere
Dim sum selections are great; I love the crab spring rolls and lettuce chicken wraps in particular
I have never ordered entrees, but friends have enjoyed them a great deal
For dessert, I recommend the banana tart - an extraordinary chocolate crust with fresh bananas and a creme filling that is ample for two
Make a reservation; Bar seating and waiting space is limited
Some of the worst Asian food I've ever eaten in NYC, served under an air-conditioning fan in industrial fashion
The blowing air actually got WORSE and COLDER when they supposedly fixed it
Every dish we ordered was poorly executed - bland or worse nasty - including the steamed shrimp dumplings, lettuce-wrapped chicken, and the incredibly fatty - an entire drumstick of fat - $20 duck
This place was built for tourists
It's a fun atmosphere but in a loud, gimmicky way
Awkward but attentive service helped us get out of there as soon as possible
Manager offered to pick up the check, but we refused
Do yourself a favor and go to Grand Sichuan on 9th and 50th if you're even thinking about the mid-town Ruby Foo's
The food is so good!! Everything I've tried here has been delicious
It was the first time I've ever enjoyed sushi
I have been to Ruby Foo's twice and was impressed both times
RF is always crowded and a good proportion of those waiting tend to be tourists
Even for those of us not on vacation, however, the food is worth the 20-30 minute wait
The salmon and sea bass main dishes are excellent and the portions generous - RF prides itself on quality of fish and guarantees freshness by ensuring multiple deliveries throughout the day
The seared tuna roll and filet mignon negamaki are also both recommendations before the main course
Try RF if you are in the midtown area
def
worth the wait and the outlay
THE BEST PLACE TO EAT, sums up ruby foo's perfectly and I think that if you are in the mood for a meal that will be satisfing if alone or with a group a friends this is the spot to hit
Put this place in you top five places to eat!!
It was good, but not great
I would recommend it, but the food is just okay
I had the seven flavor beef, and I only tasted one flavor, the beef!
The party platter of sushi was soooo small for $60
The crispy duck tasted like old duck
The portions were really small
Beautiful restaurant though
Shame on you Ruby for charging these rediculous prices for same plain old chinese food
The service is at most a C-
Never going back again
Good food that combine Chinese, Japanese and Thai
Being an Asian myself, I would give this place my thumbs up for doing it right
I love this restaurant - I always feel like I am on the set of Auntie Mame during her Asian period, the decor is that dramatic
As is the food
Excellent fare
And the service is so impecable that it borders on mechanical
But I love to dine here and come frequently
Ruby Foo's is a fun place
The food is excellent, especially the sushi and the vegetabel rice
The dumplings are luscious
The tea assortment is delicious and refreshing and the staff is very knowlegable about portion size and ordering if you come as a group or as a couple
I loved this restaurant
There are a couple of Ruby Foo's location, but my favorite is the one near Times Square

Tasty margaritas too! And enough to look at on the walls to keep any converstaion going
Great, fun place to go!
Had some friends in town last weekend and decided to try out Trailer Park on Sunday night
Very interesting decor and the burgers and the margaritas were great
The bartender we had was awesome
Although it was pretty busy in there, we didn't have to wait forever to get a drink and she was really friendly to my friends from out of town
Excellent service all around and certainly a place to enjoy a few drinks with friends
Really fun place! Food's simple, but tasty
Don't go for the mac n' cheese unless you wanna relive the cafeteria days
Fun place to bring friends, and have a loud dinner
The best grilled cheese I ever had! Oh and the sweet potato fries are delicious
Our waitress was so fun- I wanted her to join us for dinner
The beers could be cheaper, but it wouldn't keep us away
This Trailer Park Lounge is a funny, funny goof on bad taste
You have got to see the decor
It is such a parody of itself
Although food and drinks are pretty darn good, we had a great time laughing at everything else
Fun time
Had a real laugh fest at the funny stuff that adorns the walls here
Was pleasantly surprised that the grilled burgers were that good
A good bang for your buck
We threw our holiday staff party at Trailer Park last week
The waitstaff went above and beyond the call of duty as far as service went! Better than that the food was amazing
They have a fun atmosphere and unbelievable decor
It is an excellent place to have a party, gathering, or just a few drinks! When you go definately have a margarita and the mac and cheese
You'll love it!!!
This place is a real laugh fest but food and drinks are very good considering it's basically an overdone roadhouse in the middle of Manhattan
If overkill and bad taste make you laugh, check this place out, the decor is a hoot
Brought my mom here from L
A
and she was very amused
We ate burgers (very tasty) and had strong margaritas (very potent), loved the decor and the friendly atmosphere
She said that she will tell all her friends in L
A
and they will love the campy decor and tacky atmosphere
TRAILER PARK LOUNGE we salute you!
Love it or hate it, there's no in between at this tacky homage to trailer trash
Went here to redeem a gift certificate
We had turkey and veggie burgers, they were fantastic
Loved the music and concept
Nice bartenders
Pretty cool place
Dynamite burgers, seriously campy decoration
Fun time, good for groups
My friends I went on a Sunday night
We loved the kitschy theme were psyched to have a good time
After hanging out at the bar (by the way, the bartender was awesome, really, really friendly), we decided to grab a table have something to eat
However, when we sat down, the night took a serious turn for the worse
Our waitress was just awful
did they find her living in that trailer that's attached to the wall? She was so rude, so slow, so nasty
If you go there, eat at the bar
Trust me, you will not want to shell out your hard earned cash after dealing with the poor service attitude
This place reminded me of chili's or bennigan's with all the kitschy signs to prove it
The food was pretty standard and very unimaginative
I think I've had better Mac n' cheese out of the box
Basically steer clear
Had my company's office party here
Thank you Trailer Park staff for making it so special for my staff
The food and drinks were great, not to mention that wonderful trashy-tacky atmosphere
Thanks for all the little perks
Andy and Tom you've got a customer for life!
Walked in off the street after seeing a movie right next door and was totally amused from the get go
Funny, campy decor, lovable staff and good simple grilled food, (loved the turkey chili)
Must admit, margaritas are a bit strong for my taste but my friends disagreed and said they were great, I really liked my Paradise Hawaiian Style and I am going to try to book my office holiday party here
A friend had her birthday party here and recommended Trailer Park to me
The staff could'nt have been nicer and the food (grilled sandwiches) and retro music were outstanding
This place is really alot of fun
One aside, that other angry person that was talking about the restrooms, when I was there you could eat off the floor they were so clean
Trailer Park Lounge has really good grilled burgers and chili
The margaritas are also over the top
We had a blast
This other person who said service was rude is coming from another planet or something, our waitress was delightful, so were the bartenders
All I can say is the place is a bucket of fun
While sitting in lawn chairs has its charm, and I get the idea was to be tongue in cheek, the staff is horribly rude and the food is miserable
I would have gotten a better meal and much better service at applebees
The bathrooms were disgusting, was that supposed to be part of the kitsch? I could not have had a worse experience, if you want a laid back vibe, try Acme on Great Jones street
Or if you are in chelsea, there are much better places for an inexpensive meal or a place to meet friends
Good time was had by all
Trailer Park is fun stuff
Grilled burgers, Margaritas and Cold Beer are the real thing
Loved the retro music and that photobooth is dynamite, great jukebox too
Trailer Park is different than most places because it has such a great tacky concept
They take their drinks and food very seriously though, everything was just as good as I remember it from my first visit
If you want some dime a dozen trendy club, this is not your place but if you want an unpretentious laid back bar and grill thats a real hoot, you've hit the jackpot
Great for groups
Held my birthday party here and had a great time
The staff was friendly and professional, they gave us birthday Moon Pies with sparklers in them, very tacky, we loved it
The grilled food was awsome and drinks were also great, loved the Paradise Hawaiian Style and I even got a free Trailer Park t-shirt, thanks for a nice time
Really neat place, have never seen so much cool junk in one place, it's a sensory overload
Good Margaritas, Good Food (loved my turkey burger)
To the review before this one, hello, wake up, this place is not a fancy 3 star restaurant with a menu that takes a half an hour to read, it's just a fun kind of roadhouse with a great to the point menu and I thought the prices were very fair, come out from under your rock, we are living in 2002, it's called inflation!
a nice place to hang out except for the very over-priced cheap beer and extremely limited menu
sure the food is inexpensive, but you need to eat somewhere else to get full

needed a real laid back non-trendy place like the trailer park lounge
it's just about going and hanging out
food is good (not fancy) and drinks are also very good
first and foremost, thanks to a nice staff, the saturday night bartender was very nice

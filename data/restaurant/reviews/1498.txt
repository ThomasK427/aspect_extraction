Our waiter was also great-friendly and attentive
Do yourself a favor and GO!
It was great
I ordered 5 bundles and didn't have to get it consecutively
It is great that they understand the crazy schedules of New Yorkers
I will resign with them and get my summer dstarted righjt by eating healthy!! Daniele, the Chef, really knows how to give his food great taste without adding butter or heavy creams
It's incredible
The snapper was fresh and tasty (my side was grilled pportobella shrooms with sage and balsamic curried cauliflower gratin)
My snack was fava bean hummus chips which was the perfect amount to hold me til dinner
MUST TRY
I have to say that this is definitely my new favorite place
The food is unbelievable (the guacamole and chips-crazy good) and it's cheap! It's organic, too- that stuff is NEVER cheap
You can get a panini and fruit salad for around $6
They also have homemade desserts there that are also cheap and delicious
The place is small, but they have outdoor seating and a GREAT view
It's also only two blocks away from the seaport, you can see it from their window
The staff is very laidback and friendly, too
If you like healthy, cheap, good food then go there
Forget about all that expensive, boring food at the Seaport
*Yawn*  Go now and bring friends
And might I remind you to try the guacamole
How refreshing to find a restaurant that has not only great quality but delicious food
It also didn't break my piggy bank
I love that I can sit outside and get a perfect view of the Brooklyn Bridge and seaport promenade
I love it! Definitely a destination point!
I found DODO last week when my coworkers and I decided to explore the Seaport neighborhood, which is turning into quite the destination for food and drinks! I had delicious panini sandwich on artisan bread that was amazing! My coworker said the organic tea was great too! We felt like we were transported to another time in Manahttan, with the cobblestone streets and the view of the Brooklyn Bridge
If you're in the neighborhood you should definitely check out this place!
Fresh Mozz!!! Whole wheat Crust!!! Brick Oven!!!  Great Pasta!! DELICIOUS SALADS!!! TRY THE ARUGALA SALAD!!!!  They do have a liquor license, but nothing too fancy on the shelf
Tiramisu is fantastic!
Been for brunch a few times and the food is so slow, at least 30 minutes each time
The host is annoying
keeps checking in but is totally unaware we have waited for food
I have given it a few shots thinking it would get better, but no more
The food is good, but I do not understand the hype abou this place
I've lived in the West Village for 5 years and this is my new favorite restaraunt
I've already been 5 times in the past few weeks
The vibe is fantastic
the music is good (loud enough but not too loud) and i like the lighting
it's unpretentious and friendly, and i would highly recommend it
I would also recommend doing a tasting
it's not on the menu but they are more than happy to do it
My favorite dishes are the risotto, the scallops and the cod
the cod in particular is fantastic
its packed almost every time i walk by but you can have a glass of wine while you wait
and its definitly worth it, although reservations are helpful
enjoy!!
Stopped by the little owl based on a friend's recommendation the other night and had a fantastic time
Our waitress was extremely attentive and I loved my appetizer (sliced duck with truffles and almonds) and entree (the pork chop)
The restuarant has a wonderfully unpretentious vibe, and is a beautiful spot for dinner at sunset
I will definitely return
I hate saying anything negative, but when you give a resturant (new or not) a couple of chances and still even your friends are complaining about the food (Nice presentation, but very bland - where is the slightest bit of mediterranean influence? Where!? And, given the limited chef's menu, almost nothing was available that we wanted to order
Lastly, the rissoto tasted like Lipton instant rice - not worth $14), as far as drinking - you have the option of Wine or paying 5$ for a PBR!! They have beautiful hi ball glasses and nothing to mix in them, are they just for looks? We all smelled like kitchen grease when we left because the closet they call their kitchen seems to smoke up the dining room
Not very romantic
Lastly, both times I felt as if the waitress was more interested in taking her cigarette break than re-filling my water glass
You can find something better in the neighborhood almost anywhere
Back to the drawing board, sorry guys
Good Luck
Our experience at The Little Owl , in the west village at Grove and Bedford was wonderful! The ambiance is intimate, comfortable, the perfect setting to enjoy a great meal, marvelous wines, wonderful music and be able to carry on a conversation
We were greeted by a charming Gabe Stulman, host and part owner of The Little Owl
He entrusted us into the very capable hands of our server, Monica, but came by throughout the evening to make sure we were happy and we were
very
The menu offers an interesting and flavorful variety of appetizers, salads, entrees and desserts
Creative without being pretentious
My friends and I sampled appetizers with, salmon, duck and pasta
all delicious and light enough to save room for the rest of our meal
Excellent fresh bread accompanied this course
Our host expertly selected our wines for us as requested
Three of us had melt in your mouth fish dishes including a whole red snapper, cod and halibut
Raves all around
My husband and I shared crispy chicken and a steak that was smothered in a fabulous sauce with pancetta, mushrooms and other wonderful flavors
Creamy green mashed potatoes, asparagus home fries, broccoli rabbe and other very tasty side dishes complimented our entrees well
We tried all the desserts
they sounded toofabulous to pass up
The chocolate offering was to die for!, The raspberry biegnets were light and not too sweet
just right
They were served with a little chocolate/hazelnut butter
WOW!! There was alovely assortment of freshly baked cookies and biscotti, baked strawberry custard, a variety of gelatos and fruit sorbets
The lemon basil sorbet was outstanding
Partner and chef Joey Campanaro came out to make sure we were happy with our choices
Not only did we appreciate his talent , but it was easy to see that his heart is in his work
We had a great meal and a perfectly delightful evening at The Little Owl
Don't miss it!
Our night at the Little owl was Perfect
The food, service, and ambience all get an A+
Must try the Pork Chop and the Gravy Meatball Sliders
We had a reservation which was confirmed by the restaurant once and we called again to confirm the day before (count: 2 confirmations)
We then got a call 15 minutes before the reservation asking if we were still coming as they had us down for one hour earlier
When we told them it was a mistake (the restaurant's mistake) the host was completely unapologetic and did nothing to help us get in that night
The way they handled the mistake was embarassing, especially for a new restaurant setting out to make its reputation
We were totally put off and don't plan on returning
This cozy West Village corner is run by charming people cranking out high class food
The wine list includes a good number of half bottles
and if it's beer you're thirsty for, TLO indulges with a smart selection of lambics and ales
Don't miss the meatball appetizer, the hamachi or the skirt steak
The strawberry custard was exquisite, and although our stomachs wouldn't allow it, we intend to go back to sample the 4 inch spheres of icecream that were being lowered in front of everyone around us
It won't be long before there are long lines outside of what is certain to become a neighborhood destination
Although this place has only been open 2 weeks, it has definite potential
My friend took me here as a surprise on my bday and service was excellent - our water (and wine!) glasses were never half empty and the staff was warm and wonderful
The food is also good although there are a few kinks to work out - the soft shell crab appetizer wasn't quite as 'soft' as it should be and the halibut was a little too peppery, but my friend loved his cod and said it was perfect
I have faith that this place will deliver once it has been around a little longer

The spares ribs with black bean sauce were great
A lot of wonderful pastries along with great food
The price is very good
Definitely recommended
I came here for dinner and the food was just Fantastic
The shrimp with walnuts was excellent
Everything taste wonderful
The clams with black bean sauce was delicious
I ate the whole dish myself and could have eaten more
The service is great
Must try the lobster salad
Their dinner menu is really good and well priced
They serve big portions
My favorites are: the seafood with bean curd soup, lobster in black bean sauce, lobster in ginger sauce, peking duck, chyrsanthemum tea, and the beef with bean curd soup
Delicious, authentic Dim Sum
Dinner dishes are also very good, and specialties live up to their name
It helps if you or someone in your party can communicate in Cantonese as most patrons and service staff are Chinese
Love the decor
very 'Kitch'
I will definietly go back again and again
How does this place achieve best of status?! I went after reading a decent timeout review of it, but came away unthrilled
The chicken rice in lotus leaf had no flavour at all, and I have had a lot better har gau and siu mai
a lot of the other food was way to oily (eg
ho fun noodles) and the waiters who stood around like hawks were a bit off putting
I'm sure there are much better places
This is the real deal
A diner with counter service, nothing too fancy - or even close to it, but good service and great breakfasts
Skip overcooked eggs and cubed potato brunch at a chi chi gimmick, and check this place out for good eggs, great homefries and the so claimed worlds best coffee
Beware, this reviewer only eats a 2 p

brekafast there on weekends, but everything else looks good too
In Short From hummus and doner to tabouleh and every other pita-stuffer under the Turkish sun, this Houston Street stalwart whips up Middle Eastern standards
The kebab window, which opens onto Orchard Street, does business in the wee hours with the neighborhood's bar crowd
The rest of the time, the small seating area crams with customers looking for an affordable falafel fix
Warning to the gentle-palated: When they say "hot" sauce, they mean it
Gotta say the gyro is really good
They pack it really good and it goes really good with the hot sause
it is usally crowed but thats also a good thing
The Hot sause is really hott so think before you pour it on your gyro
The soup is wonderful
Taste fresh and perfect
Bereket has a solid shish kebab for the (almost no) money, and you do get a lot of food
The rice is plain and juice from the salad tends to run and mix with everything, but the kebab itself was nicely flavored and tender and the yogurt sauce was tasty
It's no Zaytoon's, but it does the job! Since I often find myself in this neighborhood, I'm definately going back there
The prices are completely ad hoc (despite the huge menu overhead), the counter servers are aggressively rude - even scolding - toward patrons, and the food was less flavorful than every other falafel/pita place I've tried in NYC
Even at the fairly low prices, Bereket is a rip off - and even an unpleasant experience
I know folks say it's convenient to stop in after a night of drinking, but I don't think I could ever be drunk enough to go to this place again
Great food, great fast service, and cheap
And open anytime, all the time
My old review has been thrown out
The days of consistency and quality at Bereket seem to be over
The last couple of times our kebobs were served barely warm, even cold, with a very surly attitude
I've been coming here for my late night meals for years, now I need to find a new place
well i love turkish food a lot,doner,salad,adana all awesome
this place you can find always fresh food and good service ,i belive they open 24hr
workers are nice price is good
You should try this place
try over rice gyro with soup
this is the best turkish gyro i have ever eaten in new york
especially turkish gyro! try it!
Certainly the best place to eat when you are drunk as hell
Try the chicken shish kebop plate, certainly the best
I think the food at Bereket is much better than at Turkish Kitchen, or any other Turkish restaurants in town
I usually go after a long night out, or when I feel like eating delicious gyro
The lentil soup is the best
I'm always mystified by how many people rave about this place
At best, it offers serviceable falafel, baba ganoush, etc
, there is nothing special about the menu or the food
On top of that, the ambience is non-existent, the service is gruff, and the place is always packed
This is the last stop for many on the LES weekend bar circuit--which may explain the glowing reviews
For those of us who grew up in the ghetto where there is a chinese restaurant on each corner, this place was like heaven
The food is great, the service is excellent, I just love it
I didnt have to spend fifty million dollars for one plate
On average I spend $30 and that is like two meals and appetizers shared with friends! I definately recomment this place
The food quality can be a little uneven, but overall an above average chinese place
This place is perfect for lunch -- the portions are generous, the food is absolutely great, and the service is prompt
It's pretty inexpensive
The prices are just a bit higher than a regular take-out joint
I've tried many of the chinese places in the area, and Yummy House definately stands out
They were very good, it's hard to find them not fried or with meat
May be put off by the green shell but they are very tasty!
I work in Union Square and am surrounded by great Chinese food options for lunch
Yummy House is by far my favorite
For 6 dollars total you get a perfect sized entree, really good soup, and rice
Try the hot and spicy chicken!
Yummy House is one of those places where you go to get a fairly quick meal and a decent sized portion of food
There is nothing overly impressive about the place, but if you live in the area, it is a convenient value find
Appreciate this place for what it is
Groups work out well, as does simple casual dining with a couple of friends
For dates and anything fancy, don't even think about it
All and all, it depends on what type of place you like
If you're in the mood for well priced food in a casual atmosphere, give it a shot
The Scene The meeting of dramatic, wide-open space and a warm family vibe may be the key to Essex's magic
Double-height, white-washed brick walls and skylights overlook sleek black tables and chairs, creating a sparse, clean atmosphere
At the eat-in bar, bartenders serve up margaritas and Manhattans with a flair that turns alcohol into an art
The Food The fresh menu pays homage to the quirky cultural mixture of the Lower East Side, with plates like potato cake Napoleon, the Essex Cubano sandwich, scallop and mango seviche, tempura tuna and kasha varnishkes
On the weekends, it turns into a lively post-meal destination with DJs spinning an easy blend of house and hip-hop
Wednesdays bring spontaneous drag shows, which make a welcome, off-kilter nightcap
great espresso/cappuccino and great brunch, although it gets busy, so get there early
Cool place to hang out in the evenings

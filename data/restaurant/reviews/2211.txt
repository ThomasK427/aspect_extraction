Food is good (not great), the servers are great
But I have to agree with some comments over here: there's no respect for customers
the managers rush you to get you out making you feel very uncomfortable
Courteous service, food never ends
Everything was tasteful, come with an empty stomach
This place was great
They offer so much food that I suggest you not to eat the whole day before getting there
I guarantee you
From the salad bar to the wide selection of meats to the desserts, it is all spectacular
The wait is long, so it would be best to make a reservation
Summary - good food which they rush you through and do everything to up your bill
The food was good, however beware, only salad and meat are included
The waiters do not tell you that and our large party wound up with over $100 extra food because all members thought dessert, coffee/tea were included - which they lead you to believe - and they weren't
Not a pleasant feeling! After getting the $900 bill, but before paying, we were asked to please pay and then leave our table quickly because there were others waiting to eat
Not very gratuitous for the amount of money we were leaving
Very Brazilian in character, similar to its origins in Rio de Janeiro
Meats are plentiful and brought to your table endlessly
Quality relatively low
A paradise for bigtime eaterswho don't tire of eating
Every dish was both plentiful and excellent! The lamb and london broil were the best I've ever tasted
Enjoyable evening
I plan on returning!
This place rocks
The food was great
The people were cool
It was SUPER loud, so don't bring kids who can't handle the excitement and energy
An extraordinarily unique dinning experience for a party of 2 or 20
This restaurant was highly recommended to me by a well-known TV celebrity
I regularly eat at many of the finest and most expensive restaurants in the world and they all accommodate special requests
I ordered three Caesar salads without anchovies
They proceeded to make the salads table-side with large pieces of anchovies
When I politely complained they began to sell me on why the salad would taste better with diced anchovies
When I refused, they berated me and then refused to cancel the order
As if to purposely teach me a lesson, they proceeded to serve us a few raw romaine lettuce leafs with a splash of oil and charged us $10 per salad even though I refused to touch my salad
When I politely complained to the Maitre 'D, he shrugged his shoulders and did nothing
This place is a rip-off joint in serious need of an attitude change
Il Tinello is a nice small restaurant that had great service and food
Although a bit expensive it was a great place to go for an anniversery dinner
The moment you are seated the service begins to shine
Not overbearing, not pushing the most expensive wine, but intelligent and helpful captins, waiters and service par excellence
From your first course, served perfect to the right temperature, the tatse will delight you
The main entree can be fish, incredible for the 3 various dishes served at our table, to veal and other meats
The side dishes were equally terrific
And of course dessert, all of which were great
Fine tasting coffee as well
A must visit everytime in New York
Going to Il Tinello is like taking a trip back home to your mother's kitchen! All dishes are fresh, delicious perfect
The service is impeccable and exceeds even the toughest of standards
Mario, the owner and host treats you like you were a king
MAGNIFICO!
We arrived for an early dinner without reservations
Since we had theater tickets, our waiter promised to be especially attentive, which turned out to be the kiss of death
He seemed to be having trouble remembering the specials
The three tables around us were served their meals before we were, and the couple next to us, who arrived several minutes after we did, were on their dessert when we got our salads
We were never offered dessert because our waiter spent about 20 minutes at the bar calculating the checks instead
The food was good, and a good value, but the service was erratic at best
Everytime that I have visited NY I make sure to eat at least twice here
The service, ambience and food is excellent
Make sure to check out their made in house pasta! Don't bypass desert either
One of the best traditions for women is the kissing of the ceiling! It may be a touristy thing to do but it adds to the experience!
So much to say, so little room
Firstly, the staff don't listen
It seems that no we're still eating translates to italian as, please take our half finished pizza as a half bottle of wine translates to a full bottle of wine
The seemingly simply task of bring food to customers also seemed a little to difficult for the lads they managed to bring us some other tables entrees
And to top it off we were being served by a kid who at 8pm on a sunday really should have been getting some shut eye for his long week of finger painting and show and tell
I go here alot because the food is great the prices are reasonable, and it's within walking distance
We bring alot of our out-of-town guests here, as well as our toddler
Staff is extremely friendly
Not only is the pizza good, but I also like the meat and pasta dishes, and I always order the artichoke appitizer
They lost my reservation once, by were really nice about it
My husband I are in NYC at least once a month, we frequent Bricco's
We love the ambiance the food, but most of all we Love the owner Nino
It doesn't matter who you are, he treats everybody the same, just as if you were family
The Pizza the Penne Bella Donna would have to be two of my favorites
I also highly recomend asking about the Lemoncello, which Nino, himself, makes
This restaurant is not a tourist place which makes it even better the prices are not too bad
I would rather go to a place that has good food that I feel welcome at, more than a tourist trap pay a fortune be just a number
Don't forget to KISS the ceiling !!
Awful
No New Yorker in his or her right mind would eat here -- and tourists would be wise not to either
Some tourists may enjoy it because, if they're women, they can smooch the ceiling and leave their lipstick marks -- ummm
disgusting! And then they'll feel like they're experiencing real New York because they've been treated badly and overcharged
As for us, we walked out
Bricco was horrible
We waited for an unusually long amount of time for menus (and food, and water, and the check
)
My caesar salad was absolutely drenched in dressing
The quality of my chicken was not up to par and its sauce had absolutely no taste
A friend asked for cheese on her pasta and the waitstaff, including the manager, REFUSED to give it to her
They told her that they DO NOT put cheese on seafood (which was in her pasta)
Although the chef may not recommend it, you NEVER refuse to give a paying customer anything
When they finally (and grudgingly) agreed to put cheese on her flavorless meal, the waiter exclaimed 'you ruined it!', and walked away
The prices were high for such terrible food and horrendous service
I would not suggest for anyone to eat at Bricco
The restaruant is great
It was reccomended to us by locals, so it is very non- touristy
The food is inexpensive compared to most restaurants in New York City
It is aprox
$80-$90 for four people
The service was excellent-- our water glasses were always full, and the meals were prompt

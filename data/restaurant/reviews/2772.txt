This is the very best Italian restaurant in the neighborhood
My family and I go there all the time, it is our Old Faithful
We know we will never get a bad meal there, it is always perfect
July 2003 I had the rehearsal dinner for my son's wedding there and we were about 38 people, well let me tell you that every single person raved about the food
My younger son who lives in New Mexico brought his girlfriend for her first visit to NYC and she still continues to talk about New Corners
They did a superb job on the party and I couldn't have been happier
Every single dinner was delicious and made to perfection
The waiters were right there from the beginning serving drinks and making sure everyone was happy
Thank you New Corners for a perfect party
My family goes there for all birthdays anniversarys!! Everyone has their favorites
The prices are great, service is the best and the food can't be beat!! I highly recommend it!!
i have tried all the pizza joints in manhattan and this is the absolute best, try the napolitan
oh, it's not in manhattan, and that makes it better
If you enjoy fresh lox, cream cheese, and bagels cooked every minute, Original Brooklyn Bagel is the place to go
I go there everyday for lunch and there is no where else i would rather be
The only problem is that they are closed saturdays, but hey everybody needs a day off!!
The Pastrami and the corned beef are simply spactacular, the freshly grilled hot dogs are mouth watering, the best ones i have ever tried, and the cashier that works fridays and saturdays is very friendly, the waiters are amazing make you feel right at home
This place is a find
The food was delicious and a good value
I love the DIM SUM, especially the turnip cake, eggplant with shrimps, beef rolls, pork buns and the egg custards
The list goes on and on
The place can be noisy at times but you can still carry on a conversation
The women that come around with the pushcarts do not speak English that well, but the waiters do
So ordering was not a problem
Plus they have a menu with Chines and Engligh on it
Being non-asian, I didn't feel out of place
I have had occasion to go to this establishment several times - a few times for dinner, and once for Saturday dimsum, and I must say that while I felt slightly intimidated by the fact that I was one of the few non chinese speakers there, the food was rather good
The dining room is huge and most dishes are served family style
The wontons in the wonton soup are wonderful and the broth is flavorful
The items available during dimsum time were plentiful - the turnip cake was excellent
I recommend this place for anyone who possesses a sense of adventure and doesnt mind having to struggle to communicate!
I travel with friends several times a month from Manhasset just to savor thir roast beef and gravy
There are no frills, however everthing is fresh and tasty and reminds you of days of yore
This place is a gem
The roast beef in the soaked bun is delicious
So tender and so good
Get the cheese fries when you go
This experience is worth a trip to Brooklyn from almost anywhere
The tables and the atmosphere are pure Brooklyn
The best
I've been going here for the past 5 years and have never been dissapointed
The sushi is always good, the Ginza Rolls are heavenly! For the price, this is the best sushi
Definitely one fmy favorite susi rests in nyc
I think they were doing 1/2 price sushi before anyone else in nyc was doing 1/2 price sushi
The price does not reflect the service, quality, or taste of the food whatsoever
The service is alwyas kind and friednly althoug the restaurant is mall and almsot always crowded because it is so good and teh food is alwaysfresh and deeeelicious
Best rolls, miso soup, noodles, and beef negimaki I've ahd anywher in brooklyn in nyc
Consistently good and recomended
My husband and I have been going to Ginza for almost 8 years! The sushi is the best~ and I have had sushi in so many restaurants all around the city
They have wonderful half price deals, that you won't find anywhere else
They have little booths if you want a little privacy w/ your date~ and they have large tables for families and groups
They have recently expanded to make more room due to the super business! The staff is very friendly too~  Everything is wonderful about this place except for the bathroom
I happen to think that a restaurant bathroom is a huge reflection on the restaurant
They should have renovated the bathroom when they did the extension
My advice: go the bathroom at home, and then go to Ginza for EXCELLENT sushi and service
If you order from home you can pick up yourself but, the sushi is better if you dine in
I cannot say anything bad about ginza
they recently expanded the place allowing parties
I know ppl complain that there is no parking but you can always take the b49 bus that travels up and down ocean ave
(dont make reservations
unless you have a party or something otherwise i dont think you can
well you can ask if u want)  large group
call in advance  if u have smaller kids make sure they arent toooo toooo loud cause it is a small resterant and it distrpts ppl
You can come to the resterant at night ~12:00 there are no ppl and you get your food very quickly
I had gone to Ginza a few years ago and liked it, but with so many other Japanese places to choose from here in NYC, it sort of got lost in the shuffle
I recently rediscovered it, and I am glad that I did
The sushi is very fresh and they offer half price sushi and rolls until 5pm, and after that, hand rolls and sushi are still on special, but rolls go to regular price
The place is rather small and get can crowded, but thats a small price to pay for such good food
I go there and buy sandwiches which are the best taste I ate in any store
They cut the roast beef, salami, etc at a perfect size
They also make there own home made mustard and is spicy which I like
The food is everything I remember best about Kosher Delicatessens growing up in Brooklyn
Once they were everywhere in NY
Now we're down to a precious few
Jay Lloyd is by far, no contest the best
Pastrami, corned beef, brisket, Romanian tenderloin steaks, all huge and fabulous
Plus, they have a large selection of less fattening items and even vegetarians can find interesting entrees to try
Jay and Lloyd's is the best deli I have ever been to
Their pastrami and corned beef, which I found out they make themselves is unbelievable
For people who prefer vegetables, their vegeterian wraps are the best
A real neighborhood place
Buckley's has great steaks and burgers and their fries are to die for!!! Plus they do so much for the community including the Buckley's to Kennedy's run every springl If you're down in the Marine Park section of Brooklyn stop in for a beer and a burger
You'll be glad you did!!!
my extended family and I have been loyal patrons of micheal's for over 20 years
Michae's is simply the essence of Italian food and truly embodies the elegance of all that is italian
The seafodd is amazing, the wine menu is up to par with many of the 5 star restaurants in the city and the overall quality of the food is amazing
I started going to this family owned restaurant over a year ago and now they can't get rid of me
I have never met nicer restaurant owners as well as staff which is complemented by great food
I was on my way to our usual pizzeria with some very hungry kids who didnt think they could handle another 20 minutes of driving
As I turned a corner from Nostrand Ave, the Original Pizza IV caught my eye with its spaciousness and clean look
I decided to give it a try and was very pleasantly surprised
This was the best pizza Ive eaten in years
Unfortunately, they had very limited drink selection to go with it
Only sodas and Snaple (which contains 3 times as much caffeine as any other iced tea, Brisk for example), juices (apple in particular) would be much more preferable by my kids
Being lactose intolerant, I never thought that I would be able to experience the taste of pizza
But low and behold, I found a place, a pizza place, that actually caters to the lactose challenged
Knapp Street Pizza In Brooklyn NY has THE BEST veggie pizza
Its a sicilian slice made with freshly grilled veggies which lie on top of a sumptous tomato sauce
The breading is so thick and once you polish off one, its quite filling
Knapp Street Pizza also has a variety of pizzas including: eggplant, ziti, chicken parmigiana and so on

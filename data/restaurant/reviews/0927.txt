It was quite beautiful inside, like the inside of a vast hallowed-out boat turned upside down
My husband ordered the duck and I ordered the sake black cod
He didn't like his duck as much as I liked the cod
It was one awesome tasting cod with perfect flakiness and great sauce!
i've been here twice and liked it both times
the food is great, if on the expensive side, and the service is good
unfortunately, the pre-dinner sakenade drink recommended on this site was awful! sour to the extreme, and the bar tender conceded he makes his drinks on the sour side
for 13 bucks not worth it
the mohito was just as bad
would go back but stick to the food
The first thing you'll notice when you arrive is the very cool, comfortable atmoshpere, you'll feel like you're in for a fun night
Recommend making a reservation and sitting downstairs if possible in order to enjoy the full effect of the room
Food is excellent, my favorite dish is the mushroom appetizer cooked in paper - yum
Their whole fish dishes, whether on the menu or as specials, never disappoint
Is also good for just sushi
I've been to Matsuri multiple times with multiple friends/colleagues and we've always had a good time
I was not very impress with the service at this place
Can the wayters smile once in a while? It was just too much happening and didn't get to enjoy my food
i've been to this place couple times and compare to all the bad reviews this restaurant has it is really not that bad
it is definately one of those 'checking out to see if there's any celebrities' place but i think i saw someone who looked like colin farrell
their food is good (head-on shrimp, fried sea bass, lobster sashimi) service is not so great
Martini
don't waste your money, stick to sake or beer
i hear so many people talkin about how they weren't seated on time, had to wait
make your RESERVATIONS!!and it is not so bad if your wait about 5 min even with a reservation
if you are walking into the place with already pissed off mood
of course you are going to have terrible experience
calm down people and if you don't like it so much, complain on the spot maybe they can fix it!
Don't believe the hype! This place has the worst Japanese food in all of NYC
Most items on the menu sound great but what comes out of the kitchen is something else
The Kobe beef was frozen first of all and oh, it wasn't Kobe beef
As for the sushi
- that's about the size you're gonna get here
Do you like it warm? Yeah, me neither
The service didn't suck as much as the food but there was probably as many waiters, busboys and staff running around as there were customers
You can always tell the quality of a Japanese restaurant by counting the number of Japanese patrons, if any
I didn't see any at Matsuri (besides me)
Went here last Saturday and was definately not disappointed
The room is beautiful
They were extremely overbooked and we waited 40 minutes to be sitted but what do you expect on a Saturday night
While we were waiting, it was frustrating because we wanted to get a drink but the bartenders were just too over-worked
Also the $13 cocktails aren't anything to write home about
Stick with the beer, its good, its different, and its cheaper in comparison
Once we were seated, the service was wonderful
We were very pleasantly surprised at the prices for such a trendy place
In total, we spent about $35 a person including the beers at dinner
That really isn't bad at all
The sushi was a little too salty for my taste and the portions are small
Try the shrimp dumplings for an appertizer, very good!
arrived to meet a party of five and were squeezed into a small table , the drinks were extremely poor and the food was decent but microscopic and overpriced
whats the draw with yhis place? couldnt wait to leave and get a decent drink some where else
Have dined at Matsuri a dozen times and each time is as good as the first
The food is terrific, service is very attentive and the scene is great
Bar scene is electric and dining room is always good for at least one celebrity sighting
Great for meals with close friends or family, not so great for business as most of the entrees are not sufficiently large to be meals in and of themselves and require sharing
For a date or casual dining, absolutely cannot go wrong here
Just make sure you make a reservation
I recently went to Matsuri's for dinner and it was great
We got seated right away
Our waitress was very friendly
The presentation on the food was really nice and the food overall was very fresh
I am planning to go back again
I went to Matsuri last night for an early valentine's day dinner with my bf
The ambience was beautiful and spacious and the food was spectacular
The service was also very friendly
I can't wait to go back!
Just had a business dinner there last night
The food was great and the service was flawless (almost to the point of too much)
The bill was reasonable, we didn't have to wait (although the table was a little small for our party of 5), and we were not rushed
I'll go back
This place is terrible
First of all, we were a party of five and they seated us at a table for 4
When we asked if we could have the nearby table for 5 people, they said it was for another party
We ended up having to put a chair on the end which blocked foot traffic
Now why wouldn't they have given us the 5 person table since we were seated first, makes no sense right? Well get a load of this, when the other party was seated, they were only four
Do you believe that? How freakin rude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And if that's not enough, the food sucked
I've had the same caliber sushi from a supermarket
Our entire party was very disappointed with the food
The atosphere is nice and our waitress was very nice, but that's about it! There is so much better out there for the money!
Perfect! lovely lovely lovely
The food was incredible! (GET the sirloin steak, the duck breast, the mushrooms, the seared tuna, sake black cod - the tasty list goes on and on)
The sushi/sashimi fish practically swam in from the ocean, its firm suppleness is rarely found
The rolls could be a bit more varied but they are so good! - delicately soft and chewy
The specialty cocktails and the sake are out of this world, created with real japanese style
The bartenders are FUN and enthusiastic - the waitstaff was wonderful and attentive
While it can get packed Thurs - Sat it's worth the energetic atmosphere
For truly quiet and private nights go on a Sunday or Monday (slow nights means more personal attention) The decor is unrivaled in its gorgeous arched ceiling and floaty imported japanese lanterns
Celebrity watching a + and a definate new favorite of mine
The decor of Matsuri definately speaks louder than its food
Went there on a weeknight with reservations and did not have to wait at all
Appetizers were tasty as was the sushi and rolls
The food was good but not outstanding
Prices were expensive for the tiny portions
Wait staff was attentive and helpful
The decor was pretty impressive
A good people watching restaurant
Definately worth a try
Went to Matsuri for my third and final time last night
The food and service has deteriorated with each visit
We waited a long time for our food and one of our appetizers showed up after we finished dinner

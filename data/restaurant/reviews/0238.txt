While the food is good, it is actually slightly worse than most of its new competitors
What was new a few years ago now seems stale and outdated
As for the service, well, nothing good there
The crowd is certainly energetic, particularly the tourists and the BT-ers who stand in awe in front of the big Budha; unfortunately, that is the feature that stands out most prominently at Tao
to be selectively ignored
Tao was quite successful at achieving the latter
Our seat location was freezing and lousy (far from the Buddha, altho there were plenty of better seats available)
Both the party next to us and us complained
The maitre d' told both parties hell try to accommodate
When he returned (problem not solved), he only addressed to the party next to us
Later on, he only checked on the party next to us, continued to ignore us
We would've said something, but feared they might add some ingredients to our incoming meal (turned out the food was lousy)
With this kind of service, even the forgiving Buddha'll feel offended/mistreated (if not already being placed in a restaurant called Tao that has nothing to_do with Buddhism)
Hope the owner improves the service, for Taos on its way (or should I say tao, which also means harmony) to chaos
I've went recently as a company lunch with approx 15 ppl
There was prompt seating with our own little area on the third floor
Great decor!! Most of us got the prixe fix lunch and everything was great
The chicken satay was wonderful with a bit of spice
Steak was perfect and even cut into small pieces
The dessert was a spring roll filled with fugi apple and a scoop of ice cream
It was a great experience
New Yorkers would have to be out of their minds to waste their time at this self-important tourist trap
This restaurant consistently refuses to honor its own reservations, and treats its customers like cattle, forcing them to wait in the bar area (where overpriced cocktails are conveniently available) long after the time the table was supposed to be ready
Upon arrival at the table, the food is indifferently prepared and presented
In time, word about this sorry excuse for a New York restaurant will spread, and it will go to the early grave it deserves
food: average chinese takeout is better
crowd: tacky tourists and bridge and tunnel types
you will more than likely see many pairs of Dockers khakis, bad toupees and Dress Barn outfits
service: our waitress was ok
you won't get seated right away, though
You'll be told to wait in the lounge (where you'll conveniently be able to order a cocktail right away) and hold on to a beeper when your table is ready
The fact that this place gives you a beeper is a big red flag
conclusion: one person's floor is another person's ceiling
Well, if your looking for a cheap meal-you havent found the right place
the watermellon martini had my girl hooked (4 of them later) the sushi is good - I say get the sampler - and the kobe beef is Real GOOD and when you look at the price the $30-$40 amount will fill just about one person with a piece for the other to taste
If this is a date it isnt a romantic place its a SCENE!!! so make sure you have a clear understanding before you think its a romantic dinner for two
the price is high
might as well drop some bucks enjoy a great meal do a little people watching and make a night of it
but no matter what time your reservation is for be ready to wait a little while longer
I went here a few weeks ago for an expense lunch and really liked it
Just last week I had some friends in town so I decided to go here
It was amazing
We ordered a bunch of apps, then split entrees
ALL of the food was delicious
The wait staff more than took care of us
It was just a dining delight
I would recommend this place to all!
The last time I went to Tao, it was my birthday
My whole family got the Filet Mignon that you marinate and then cook on the stone
We all loved it and thought it was delicious
When I went again last night, it was my sister's birthday
When we all ordered the stone, we were told they didn't have it anymore
We were told they had a new way to cook it
They brought it out and basically you cook it in a pot of broth
TERRIBLE
I will never go back there again
I decided to take my wife to Tao to celebrate our first wedding anniversary
We were delighted by the prompt seating, courteous attention and impecable service we received
There is a sense that there are things bigger than food happenig at Tao
It is definitely a place to go when you really feel like celebrating, and want to do it with style! It helps making reservations ahead
I heard the waiting time for those without a reservation was 1 1/2 hour the day we went
The great Buddha at the center of the dining room is impressive, even for a sophisticated diner who has seen beautiful decor
The food is surprisingly decent and the menu is cut for homestyle sharing which enables diners to share dishes
We saw Derek Jeter there
So no doubt it's a spot for people-watching if you're into it
If you're from out of town, like me, but you're well dressed and don't mind spending a little money, Tao is a must visit
I found it more hip than Budda Bar in Paris, upon which it is clearly modeled, and the food was quite good
We had the duck, some pad thai, and the giant fortune cookie
It wasn't Asiate, but it was the perfect place to feel like you were in the real CITY of new york
Infectious energy pervades the place
As those before me, I have to agree that the food was quite overrated, I have better at chinatown, so don't eat the bland, mushy, fried rice, OR the molten chocolate cake with way too many coconut shavings -but the scene is uber cool and that is its only saving grace
The mixed drinks can be quite good, like the lychee champagne, and the margarita, but stay away from the watermelon martini! I'd go to hang and impress a visitng friend, but not to eat
We went here on Mother's day and the service was excellent
We had a reservation at 5:00 and was seated immediately
It's a beautiful restaurant with excellent food! If I had to wait, as some have said they do, I would wait
It's worth it
Try the lobster in the black bean sauce
:)
Leave your inhibitions at home at TAO
There are so many beautiful and cool people there, I couldn't believe it
The food and drinks were great! I highly recommend this lounge/restaurant!
Great place! I went for a corporate function but many of the items that were served were right off of the menu
Excellent food and great atmosphere!Not terribly romantic
would be better for groups than for a date
I would go back again and again!
The food is amazing for the price; the restaurant is a bit loud and over crowded
The steak is wonderful as wall as the duck for two
The concierge at the W recommended this restaurant to us, and we were glad he did
We arrived at 9:50 and got seated at 10:30, but it was well worth the wait
The decor is amazing, a big fat lit Buddha greets you as you walk into the dining area and you can't help but feel cool surrounded by the hundreds of chatty diners (among them Jay Z and Amil) and blasting music
The food was equally entertaining
The crispy tuna sashimi is a must for starters
We ordered the kung pao chicken and soy glazed salmon with udon, and while both were tasty, if I had to do it all over again, I'd just order a few more appetizers, as they all seem very tempting
While the hosts aren't the nicest people (they have that you're lucky to be here attitude), our server was very charming and accomodating
While this place might once have been chic, and perhaps even classy, it is now a mecca for tourists carrying medium brown bags and sipping cosmos just like those crazy sex and the city girls
Unfortunately, no one has given management the message that this place has lost its luster, as they still make you wait over an hour past your reservation while sipping wine that tastes like it was poured from a magnum but costs $12/glass
But, perhaps this is all part of their attempt to maintain Tao's allure of exclusivity
The highlight of the night was undoubtedly our celebrity sighting -- twin turkey callers from Mississippi, in town for their Letterman debut
Tao's chic decor and tasty bites would remind most urban dwellers why NYC is known for its impressive social scene
It is where you go when you want to feel SATC or show off to your out-of-town visitors

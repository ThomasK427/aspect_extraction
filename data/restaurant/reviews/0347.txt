For main course we ordered monkfish and a marinated beef dish and they were both out of this world
I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone seeking a new experience
Perhaps Mr
Bolud should replace this rude individual from the place to make it a perfect 10
Don't expect Daniel service at this Theater District location
We waited 10 minutes for a menu and water glasses, were not given a wine list until we asked for one, and did not have the menu explained to us
The front room where we were seated was freezing, and got colder each time the door opened
Having been to Daniel, this was a very disappointing experience
Good food , good service , nice place and people, good for after theater dining
Modern
Okay, the food sucks and the service is lousy
The decor is pretty cheesy and I would not recommend it! The wine list isn't very good also
The staff doesn't know what they are talking about
The crowd was filled with tourists and pretty boring
This is a great spot for pre/post theater or anytime
It is no regular bistro the food is amazing!!
We were greeted by the maitre'd and promtly seated in the back or the section with tablecloths
I've ordered both house specialites: the goat cheese and tomato tatin and db burger filled with foie gras
God what a combo !!!!
Attention to detail goes from the set up of room to way the food is presented to the service
Our waiter was very professional and we'll defenitely go back
wonderful food - prefect setting - professional service
you pay for what you get - one of NY's best!
Had the db burger, which was juicy and delicious as always, at the bar
Only problem was - an older gentleman (well-dressed but a little enebriated) chose to sit down right next to me - despite the fact that all 15 other seats were free - order himself a martini, and then describe how dry and dissapointing the burger was when he ordered it a few days ago
While I was trying to eat mine!!!





The staff should have their antennae out for customers like this and quietly suggest they move to another seat
This would be far more discreet and appropriate than me dragging my plate, wine and place setting down to the other end of the bar, which is what I'll do if it happens again
I think all of the great ratings in the publications are because of the chefs name
The buger is a major dissapointment
I couldn't taste foi gras or truffles and the fried potatoes were no better then the frozen ones anyone can make at home
In fact they were worse
I will stick to his other two  restaurants
Seems like the same person is doing all the possitive reviews??? DB - PR perhaps
Went for dinner
The place is well worth visiting
Sit in the BACK dining room, we sat at a shakey table and our water kept wetting the table
Back has tablecloths and carpet
Oh yeah stay away from the host staff
the chick that sat us was all about attitude
meow!!!
Mouthwateringly good especially after being out of the country for a month
What a treat with service and fries to match!
Seems pretentious, but walk in for lunch and order one of their famous $26 burgers - with perfect fries and high-end service, it's worth every penny
a friend i went with expressed a sort of disappointment, explaining that it wasn't *really* a hamburger
wrong
this is by far the best hamburger i have ever had
better than mcdonald's, burger king, white castle, fatburger, in-n-out, corner bistro, jackson hole, and, i'm certain, anyplace else
What a great surprise? I had dinner at Daniel a couple of years ago and was terribly disappointed
Didn't come close to the hype
Well db exceeds it! I did not expect anything to be as good as it was
The food was outstanding
I actually do belive the burger is WORTH $29
Our server was outstanding professional yet friendly, a balance other restaurants miss
Don't be mislead by the Bistro description
It's like no bistro I've been to
But it's great! Can't wait to go again
We went there after the theater and it was packed and lively
However, someone was there immediately to see what we wanted to drink and the service continued to be outstanding throughout the evening
The food was fabulous too
It was a perfect ending to a wonderful night
Had a great experience last week
The food was outstanding
The prices are modest
Quality is A
The service staff is well trained
Music was good
Overall I loved It
The dinner I had last night was out of this world
The food was great seasond, portion were on the right size
Service was attentive, music was perfect I enjoyed it
Great fun place
The Scene Fiamma is the most sophisticated restaurant from the B
R
Guest restaurant syndicate to date, a group that includes Blue Water Grill, Dos Caminos and Blue Fin, among others
The colorful, lustrous layout stretches across several floors; a street-facing elevator whisks patrons from level to level
Italian pop music fills the background, while chipper waiters deliver enthusiastic service
The Food Though ostensibly a seafood restaurant, some of the kitchen's biggest hits occur elsewhere, particularly in pastas
Start with lush gnocchi tossed with fava beans and earthy morels or small ravioli stuffed with braised veal shank in a richly reduced stock
Main-course winners include a grilled dry-aged steak with leeks and juniper berries and sauteed striped bass with Brussels sprouts
Flashy desserts like a hazelnut chocolate torta and a deep wine list round out the experience
While the food is superb, and the service is top-notch, I feel that my dining experience here was not of the highest caliber because I dined here on a Sunday night
I surmise that the upstairs dining room was closed, so I did not get to ride on the glass elevator! The food was delicious, and the presentation was good as well
This is a must if you're looking for a classy restaurant
Two floors, beautiful ambience, great food
We chose to eat upstairs
There's a bar up there with a few tables where you can start off the evening, perhaps a bottle of wine that can be taken to the table
The service was great
Our waiter was very attentive, recommending dishes, describing them beautifully and then checking on us a few times to make sure we were happy, which we were
It wasn't cheap but it was worth it for a special evening with a special someone
Fiamma's food, service and wine selection are all superb
I had the short rib and it was incredible
The Octopus appetizer was also delicous
Service at Fiamma is unparalleled
The waiters are knowledgeable, courteous and friendly

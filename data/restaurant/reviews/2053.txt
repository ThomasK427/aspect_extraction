My wife and I were at least expecting a romantic dining experience, but even this one saving grace was lost between an unfriendly greeter, a haughty waiter, and an overly anxious busboy who kept circling every five minutes asking if we were done yet
On the other hand, the piano music was nice, and this helped me choke down an undercooked and overpriced piece of salmon
The icing on the cake and why we will never recommend this place to anyone was the blatantly obvious service gap between first class regular customers and everyone else
Unless you're a regular, do yourself a favor and try any number of other vasatly better restaurants on the NYC dining scene
La Grenouille if you want to spend a little more, Raoul's or Cafe des Artistes are comparable price and much more romantic sans attitude
It's too bad so many of the reviewers on this site expect to go to one of the top NY restaurants, pay $30 during restaurant week and get the meal of their life
It's also not McDonald's - the point IS to spend 2 or 3 hours over a leisurely meal!!  Every day of the week, this restaurant has a $59 prix fix dinner - which I had last night for my boyfriend's birthday
The food was excellent (the pork loin and mushroom tart were of particular note) and the service was fabulous
The waiter recommended delicious, reasonable wines and we asked him for advice on the menu
I can't wait to go back!!   Treat the waitstaff as your host, not your adversary and you just might see what a great experience you can have!!
We went during restaurant week which is key - i would not pay full price for this place
we had a good pre-fixe meal, but the service was sooo slow
we had a 6:30pm reservation and was finished by 9pm
it was as if they forgot their customers as most of our section was looking around for the wait staff
the atmosphere is romantic, but nothing to go out of your way for
I found One by Land Two By Sea to be very impolite to Food Week customers
Both the barman and the hostess were snappy and offensive
I was told that I had to pay at the bar before I could be seated
The food was insipid at best and we had to wait 45 minutes between the starter and the main course
Embarrassingly enough, I was trying to impress my guest by taking them to this so called, romantic restaurant
I will never go there again nor recommend it to anyone
I am really sorry we waisted our time during resaurant week to visit this restaurant again
Since the last time we were there the place has gone down, downhill
The rooms are old, the food was nothing special, the staff was nice, but lacked skill
Thank heavens we didn't spend much money on the awful pork meal (tasted more like a Thanksgiving ham) and the boring chiken
Do not waste your time and money
Go to Montrachet, Chanterelle, Park Avenue Cafe, Union Square Cafe, etc
Every aspect of this restaurant is amazing
The food is incredible (especially the Beef Wellington), the service is spot-on and the decor is beautiful
The cost of $59 for the pre-fixe 3-course dinner is well worth it and I would eat here every weekend if I could
This restaurant is absolutely amazing
Romantic atmosphere with dainty old-fashioned decor - beautiful
Hidden location on Barrow street makes it even more inviting
The Beef Wellington was out of this world! And the wine list and desserts - great! Definitely splurge at this restaurant because it is well worth it!
This is truly one of the most amazing restaurants in New York City
As a veteran restaurant goer in NYC, I can honestly say that I had one of the most memorable meals in my life at One IF by Land
The rack of pork is to die for
My wife's monkfish was also very incredible
Great food and attentive service in a candlelit atmosphere with live piano music
Who can ask for anything more
I went here with my boyfriend for his birthday
This was the most romantic restaurant I've ever been to
The food was good, but not for the price we paid for it
However, the service was the best I've ever had at a restaurant (although that's the way it should have been since we paid a lot for the food)
Also, we were the youngest people at the restaurant
The average age of the restaurant patrons was approximately 35/40 years old
However, the servers did not treat us badly(which I find happens often to younger people in classy restaurants)
I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a romantic night out!
Visited mid-week
Busy but not overly crowded
Had a table for 2 on the main floor with view of the entire room
Beautiful setting with well prepared and attractively plated conservative continental fare
Tuna tartare is a standout
Overall effect is unfortunatley flawed (at least in our case) by earnest but unpolished service
The wine list is on the expensive side
I had them fax me the wine list and found a solid 1999 Graves for $45 (checked it against Robert Parker vintage chart) Suggest you do the same
valentines dinner package was way over priced
Service was no where to be found
Not even sure who was my waiter
The bread guy came over more than the waiter
Check came before we could finish the dessert
One time experience
This is one of the most romantic restaurants in the world
The atmosphere is positively wonderful - especially when the gifted pianist is playing (very nice touch on the keys)
The warm glow of the fireplace makes it a really nice winter restaurant
The service was very friendly, but unfortunately inefficient
Some of the white wines we sampled were not properly chilled
It was also terribly smokey by the bar when we first walked in
Fortunately the smoke didn't carry into the restaurant area
Despite our minor complaints, the overall dining experience was still very positive
But they've got to do something about the bad, live piano act
Abba, for goodness sakes! Inappropriate for such a romantic setting
The service was spotty with repeated requests to refill out water glasses necessary
The appetizers fine, but nothing outstanding
The entrees were better than the first course, but still nothing to write about
Desserts were blah and definitely not up to par for such a place
Wine list was extensive, but we got mixed drinks instead
The one thing we did enjoy quite a bit was their dirty vodka martini
Pricey, but mixed very well
We'll probably not be back; too touristy a destination
Had a lovely evening there lat night with my boyfriend and another couple
Even though we are 20 somethings who were there for restaurant week the staff was very courteous and didn't treat us differently than any other patrons
The restaurant is very romantic in an overdone sort of way
We sat upstairs in a quiet red room which was lovely
The food was excellent and they accomodated our vegetarian requests with a delicious leek and truffle ravioli that melted in the mouth
Portions are a bit smaller compared to most restaurants but the food is very rich
My only 2 criticisms were the very expensive wine list and the ordinary dessert
The chocolate chip cake tasted like a store bought muffin
Over all it was great though
Restaurant week got us here - we'll definitely come back
Great place for a special occasion
Very romantic - lots of fresh roses, silver, candles
Feel sorry for those who did not have a pleasant experience during restaurant week - our's was superb from begining to end
Had visited Chateau La Nerthe on a recent trip to France, so were especially pleased to see their wine on the list!
Granted we made the mistake of going during restaurant week, so the service was rushed and the menu was sparce
But there is still no excuse for running out of HALF the wine list and half the entrees on the menu
Our waiter must have been a 'stand-in' because he did not know the menu, choices or basic service protocol (bread plate on the left)
Also, tables were ridiculously close together
Lots of large groups
This is not what we expected from NYs most romantic restaurant!

the noodle soup dishes are usually bland and has no flavor but really a great value for their lunch specials
make sure you get there around noon or be prepared to wait outside
my husband alberto i come here every single nite for dinner
we cannot get enough of this place! the friendly chinese waitstaff is absolutely wonderful
the service is impeccable the food is sotto cinque! what more could u want than underpriced mouthwatering chinese food???
In contrast to what others said here, I found the weekday lunch combination to be really tasty
I've gone to several places that had mediocre, at best, tasting lunch combinations, and this is defiantly much better
It was also slightly cheaper compared to other restaurants in the same area
I have never tried the noodles because there are just too many different choices and they don't give you much time to order
Also, it their menus are a bit difficult to read, there is a lack of hierarchy, which makes it confusing at first glance
The store is very small and it may be difficult to find a place to sit during lunch hours
There is usually a line
I don't see how this gets one of Citysearch's best
service was reasonably quick via delivery, but the hunan beef had no spice whatsoever and the chicken chow mein really looked inedible
I didn't risk it-- it looked like raw sewage with chicken chunks thrown in
Kudos to everyone who's had a good experience here, but I'll stick to Pam's Real Thai Food, which has NEVER let me down
The Scene The bustling dining room is cleanly decorated, with white walls, polished wood and black-and-white framed photographs
Waiters move with blinding speed, taking and delivering orders with a brusque approximation of courtesy
The clientele is made up of biggish spenders who enjoy the full bar and don't mind the immoderate prices, or special-occasion diners who wanted elegance and insisted on Chinese
The Food This menu attempts to take Chinese food upscale with re-invented classics, like savory shark-fin soup and supple, greaseless tea-smoked duck
The Peking duck prix fixe, which comes with a hearty complement of sides, starters and extras for $38, is a sure winner
Not all dishes are hits, however: The scallion pancakes are on the dry side, and dumplings are gummy
Moo shu pork would be great at a quarter the price, but here its ordinariness rankles
My wife and I dined at Chin Chin over the weekend with a large party of 10
I could not have been more satisfied with the dining experience
The service was attentive, the ambience was elegant and the food was extraordinary! This place is going to become a regular for me
I would definitely recommend this exceptional chinese restaurant!
I went to Chin Chin for the first time with my two co-workers last night
Honestly, it was overpriced chinese food
We ordered three dishes and shared them, the meal came out to around $90
I am Chinese American, I grew up in Chinatown, and I grew up eating Chinese food
You can get the same great tasting food and better, the same dishes and more in Chinatown for half the price that Chin Chin offers
Though you will not get the ambiance and not the same service, you will enjoy eating great tasting food for cheap in Chinatown
If I brought my mother to Chin Chin, she'd yell at me for wasting money on such foods
I mean to find authentic Chinese food, where else would you go besides Chinatown? There are great tasting restaurants for dim sum, for lunch, brunch, and dinner for not even half the price spent at Chin Chin
I eat out a lot from low-key to fancy restaurants and this might seem like a very harsh review, but it's the truth
I would go back to Chin Chin, for the ambiance, but as for the food, I've had better
The waiters were speaking Cantonese, Chinese
I heard their entire conversation
Disappointing, disappointing
Although I can agree with the rushed service complaints, I'd have to disagree with just about everything else a lot of these posters have noted
For one, I think Chin Chin's food is DELICIOUS! Their shrimp dumplings, which I usually request fried, are breathtaking (for lack of an even better word)
Their ribs are perfect
And, my fav - their szechuan shrimp are right on point
Not to mention, the owner Mr
Chin is very pleasant and welcomes everyone as if he's been waiting on you all day
And, the wait staff are great too
A large party of friends had dinner there this week
We were seated in a private room which was nice
Upon arrival we had drinks at the bar, the bartender was nice but service was slow, he seemed obviously overwhelmed
We were served pri- fix appetizers, there were 24 of us and they charged us $400 for this, ridiculous considering what we got and the standard to which it was prepared, then I had my entree ofcrispy sea bass
I use the term crispy very loosly, as it was swimming in sauce
My rice was served 5 minutes after the fish, only after I had to ask for it
I did not enjoy my dining experience, neither did my friends, the service was terrible (I also am a server), the food was very average and extremely overpriced
It was an overall disappointing experience
The food was so ordinary I could have gotten it anywhere in hicktown USA
The service was slow, and menu selection disappointing
If you like Chicken and Broccoli or General Tso's, this might be a good place for you
But in NYC, I don't think that would satify your appetite
The only positive spot is there is almost no wait for a table, and the reason is obvious for me
First of all, the restaurant is lovely
It was half full and we were seated immediately - in the back area, which was attractive but happened to be where all the idle waiters hung out which felt awkward
We had the prix fixe Peking duck
Hot Sour Soup was good (not amazing)
Duckskin pancakes were crisp and good, but VERY rich (it is duck skin, after all)
The fried rice with sweet Chinese sausage and scallops was EXCELLENT as was the sauteed spinach
The stir fried duck was
okay
It was very saucy and didn't seem very duck-like
The sorbet was freezer-burned
The service was polished-seeming but WAY too quick waiters swooping in and removing plates before we were finished
(??)  The whole meal was finished in less than an hour - for that amount of money I want to linger for a while, you know?
Had after theatre dinner one nite last week
We were warmly greeted by owner and staff
Dishes were made to order and served hot at the table
We requested sharing and the waiters separated each dish into several plates expertly
Though not on the menu, do try the Grand Marinier Shrimp, a luscious and unique taste
The spare ribs are the best the 10 ingredient fried rice was superb was mixed into everything
Great dining experience
For a Thursday night, the restaurant was half empty
The waiter rushed us to order and then threw one thing after another in our faces
We were in and out in 45 minutes
The food was good
if you have time to taste it
THIS RESTAURANT HAS CHINESE FOOD FOR NOVICES
IF YOU CAN'T USE CHOPSTICKS OR JUST DISCOVERED GENERAL TSO' CHICKEN THEN COME HERE AND PAY TRIPLE OVER TAKE OUT
Chin Chin came highly recommended but boy were we all disappointed
Chin Chin fell way short on service (bus boy ignored my friend; waiters were haughty and need to learn the words customer service)
The food was far worse than competitors Chiam, Mr
K or even the overrated Shun Lee
A GROUP OF 5 FRIENDS AND I VISTITED CHIN CHIN'S ON A SATURDAY NIGHT
WE STARTED WITH SOME SOUPS WHICH WHERE GOOD BUT NOTHING OUT OF THIS WORLD, TO FOLLOW WE TRIED THE MIXED DUMPLINGS
THINGS WERE NOW GETTING A LOT BETTER
BUT THE STAR OF THE SHOW WAS THE MAIN COURSES, WE TRIED 6 DIFFERENT ONES WHICH WAS PROBERLY 2 TOO MANY AS THE PORTIONS ARE REALLY BIG
THE FRYED BEEF IN ORANGE WAS THE TASTIEST DISH THAT I HAVE EVER HAD IN A CHINESE RESTAURANT
IT WASN'T CHEAP BUT AS I SAID WE O
D'ED ON THE MAIN DISHES
WE DIDN'T BOTH WITH WINE STICKING INSTEAD TO THE CHINESE BEER WHICH IS VERY LIGHT AND NOT TOO GASSY
nothing was great
nothing was bad

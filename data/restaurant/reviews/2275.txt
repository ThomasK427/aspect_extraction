When we insisted on waiting for a 4-person table, not only did he raise his voice, he also sat the group that showed up 20 min later first when a 4-person table became available
Then he mentioned that another group had reservation at 8:30 and would also have priority over my group (we appearantly had lost our reservation AND our place in queue for refusing a table that was too small)
Luckily that group never showed up and we were finally seated after an hour of waiting
I have alway enjoyed Topaz's food
It is such a shame that my experience had to be tainted by such lack of professionalism
I would recommend avoiding this restaurant as far as possible
The food is awful and the service is the worst i have ever experienced
Not only are they rude but they even heckle you to leave a tip to their satisfaction
This is quite possibly the best Thai food outside of Bangkok
The pineapple fried rice is out of this world
It is small and a bit crowded - but WORTH IT!!! My friends and I just LOVE the food here
We have never tasted better Thai food in NY than at Topaz
Sara (the owner) took personal care of us and her staff made our dining experience trully memorable
A bit pricy yes, but it was money well spent
We are no experts on Thai food, but I do appreciate tasty, well made food
The Salmon dish was superb, as was the beef noodle dish and the Bangkok Pork Fried Rice
Would we go again? YOU BET!!!
The food here is excellent, but contrary to what others have said, this restaurant does not have great prices
It may be cheap by midtown standards, but for a Thai restaurant it is actually a bit pricy
Portions are small and you have to pay extra for rice
it adds up
I still recommend it highly
The fragrant red curry vegetables are some of the best I've ever had
But if I weren't in midtown, I'd stick to my local Thai place
Don't be adventurous when eating here
I tried the Tamarind Duck expecting them to use tamarind and maybe a little bit of duck, and instead I got a plate full of straw mushrooms, pineapples, and duck skin
It was so overpoweringly sweet as to be almost inedible
And I can eat anything
Stick with the pad thai
Excellent Thai in a charming little dining room
Have been here 3 times, and every time the food and service are top notch
In my opinion, the best Thai and price in the city
The atmosphere and the waiters were pretty nice, but the food tasted a little too sweet and lacked the spice you would generally expect from Thai food
Maybe it was just the fish we ordered
I've been to Topaz about half a dozen times and everytime I've been there, the food has been delicious and the prices are great! There are very few places like Topaz in this city!
The Scene A distinctive array of neighborhood characters sinks into squishy black-vinyl banquettes, watching the world pass by
Actors and producers seal deals over big salads; couples cuddle behind whimsical plastic partitions; and cheery waitresses mix milkshakes for kids
As if this casual spot needs any more personality, there's a ceramic bust of Elvis and a slew of celebrity action figures behind the bar
The Scene The inexpensive American-Thai menu offers a random mix that couldn't be more satisfying
American favorites, like spicy meat loaf with creamy mashed potatoes and gravy, win out over Asian-inspired mainstays
Wasabi-seared tuna wraps and vegetable-stuffed pad thai taste fresh, but it's hard to beat the juicy burgers dripping with melted cheese
Unexpected extras, such as sweet brioche rolls, crunchy homemade potato chips and red-cabbage slaw, distinguish Vynl as a food-serious diner
Don't skip coconut-banana bread pudding: It's comfort on a plate
When Vynl was at 54th and 9th, it was by far my favorite where should we go for dinner restaurant
Great food, great view of the passing parade on 9th Ave
, friendly staff
I was excited when I learned it'd be moving literally around the corner from me, at 51st and 9th, but since it moved it's been a HUGE disappointment
The old Vynl was loud; the new one is ear-splitting
The food is still good, but I was disgusted to find that with brunch items, you're only given ONE LOUSY SLICE of toast
Every Greek diner in the city, every OTHER restaurant gives you two
But not the New Vynl
How chintzy is that?  Even worse, though, is the utterly abysmal service
It seemed to take the new staff forever to figure out what they were doing; I had one nightmare of a brunch where the registers didn't seem to work and it literally took over an hour to get our check
I don't really know how long; I got disgusted and left the money on the table and split
A decently run place might've found some way to apologize for the inconvenience, but not Vynl
On the several times I tried Vynl after the move, service has ranged from indifferent to abysmal
I decided to give it a rest for a few months to see if the staff could get its act together
Went there a couple of days ago with a friend for dinner
The place wasn't at all busy, and we were shown a table in the back, given our menus, and promptly forgotten about
After fifteen minutes, when nobody even took our drink order, I looked around to try to get our waitresses attention only to see she and about five others of the waitstaff were having an endless gabfest by the register
I couldn't get anyone's attention because nobody was even bothering to look back in our direction
We ended up walking out and going to Renaissance, where at least the staff knows you're alive
I've written Vynl off my list forever; and it used to be at the top
Good going, idiots
Their menu clearly states that on Saturdays, Sundays, and Holiday Mondays they serve brunch from 9:30 to3:30
Well, again when I called to order brunch today, Memorial Day at 11am, they said we are not doing it today
Enough said
I had passed Vynl too many times but never went in until my friend told me it is her favorite secret spot
We went one night and I was so happy to have found a place that serves what seems like Everything including the Best Watermelon martinis, chicken satay, turkey meat loaf, and so so much more
This place is very reasonable and the staff is very nice
We try to go there as a group every week its that good!!!
Not sure what to expect (they serve American + Thai) I tried out w/friends and was very impressed
We tried both American and Thai, 7 of us tried 6 different dishes and all were delicious
The servings were generous and the highlight after dinner was the banana-coconut bread pudding
Service was very pleasant and decor very creative
I loved the vinyl record menus and the bathrooms w/different music artists! This is a must try!
I totally love this place
I was staying at The Hudson for Valentine's Day weekend not this year but last year
and me and my date both fell in love there
We were seated promptly, and the food was more than plenty and good
I would definitely go back if I am ever in that area again or stay at The Hudson again
which is a great place to stay in the city; I highly recommend the two ;)
So loud talking isn't really possible, and the food is ok, but nothing fantastic
The cutesy decor doesn't make up for its shortcomings
Summing it up
I actually received my drinks with my bill!! I was with two friends, and we received two Cokes and a Sprite WITH our bill on our way out
The food was ice cold, and our requests fell on deaf ears
I've been here a couple times, with average results, but this will have been my last trip to Vnyl
There are so many good places to eat/drink on 9th and in that area, this is not good food, good service, or a good value
Do yourself a favor, and choose somewhere else
I love the causal fun atmosphere at Vynl
The service is generally pretty good
They used to be a small restaurant, before they moved down the street to a new location- which is four times the size
And they are STILL always busy
Fun music, decor and bathrooms!
The old VYNL had a hip feel to it, but somehow managed to be welcoming and cozy
The old Citysearch review was accurate, but like my opinion of the new VYNL, needs to be reworked
The new VYNL is annoyingly loud and they are clearly having problems handling the increase in traffic I brought a party of four and waited nearly an hour for seating
I was told, I was the next big group on the list but they were constantly cramming newer groups of two into available spaces the hostess faked nice but was snide when confronted
Something doesnt feel right about this place anymore bottom line bigger isnt always better

ambience was bustling, fun, loud and the service was good
however, the food was disappointing: tried two antipasti (octopus and eggplant) which were good but not great
the 2 pizzas we tried (funghi and taleggio and the spicy salami) were too dry and not very exciting
i am a big mario fan (the old Po, Babbo and Esca are all fantastic) but this food seemed sub-par for him
I would go back for the atmosphere, the wine list and the relatively inexpensive food but i wish i had liked it more!
Went with a friend last night and had a decent time
The wait for a table was an hour and 15 minutes! And it's really hard to see your name on the board if you sitting at the bar
The wine was good and reasonably priced but hard to pick out by yourself
When we finally sat down we were on opposite sides of a communal table
something I definitely do not like
And we were freezing
The air was blowing on us full blast
I asked for it to be turned down and it did get warmer for a little while but it made our pizza stone cold as soon as it was served
The pizza was good and it wasn't that expensive but they definitely need to work out the kinks
i knew to come for lunch when there wouldn't be a wait
great idea
the place to youself, great friendly service and the best real pizza i've had in a long time
lovely light crisp just the right amount dough, richly flavored olive oil drizzeled on top
not saucy, drippy, soggy with layers of cheese american pizza
pizza that allows you to taste the perfectness of the dough and whatever you've chosen to put on top
loved it! can't wait to go back
The Mario/Joe team have done it again
The concept is simple,the food is simple,the wine list is inexpensive
Everything was great,of course we went early and didn't have to endure a wait
It was packed when we left
I didn't even stick around after I waited over forty five minutes for a table at 10:30 PM, on a Tuesday night
I've read some of the reviews and this place has NOTHING to do with italy, except that it's like the tourist traps I avoid in Rome
It was noisy, I couldn't even hear my partner sitting across from me AND they pulled that same, we're out of your wine business
No surprise
Who wants to order a $60 bottle of wine with pizza? Especially, the soggy looking type
You want real pizza and wine, go to Trastevere in Rome and pick any restaurant near Santa Maria
It will be worth the airfare alone! Save your money and your ticket from this place for the real stuff later
It's been open less than 2 weeks, and that really showed in the service -- it was s-o-o-o s-l-o-w
Our server looked, and acted, like a deer caught in the headlights -- on the rare occasions when she visited our table
Worse, three out of our five wine selections (2 glasses, one bottle) were finito
Huh? All of our second selections were significantly more expensive than the first
If it were PC Richards, this would be called a bait and switch
Pizzas were cold and pretty tasteless, as well as skimpy on the toppings
Antipastos were VERY good, though
The pizza tasted just like the pizza I had in Italy
A lot of people may be scared off by how different that is from NY-style or coal oven pizza, with the softer crust and sweeter sauce, but it was excellent
The creamy, homemade gelato alone, though, made the experience worthwhile
They don't take reservations, and there was a half an hour wait
Even the wait was enjoyable, though, because the front bar was such a beautiful space and the winelist was so extensive
I can't wait to go back
We went for lunch on Saturday, wait wasn't bad considering that it had only opened recently
The tickets for the cities are a cute idea
While we were waiting for our train/table, we enjoyed a wonderfully, sinful hot chocolate and a great espresso at the bar, which incidentally had some very nice details
Definitely family-oriented vibe to the place
The owner's kids happened to be running around
Food is above standard, not quite Lupa, but almost
Some pizzas much better than others
The classic margherita was done perfectly
Sides are delicious
Wine list impressive
Service is the only down
They really need to work on flow and approach
But, I'm sure that will only get better with time
The pistachio gelato was sinfully good
I'd recommend each getting their own, otherwise there may be a fight
Came to Otto a few days after it's opening date for a late lunch
It's a great space, service just a tad off, but I'm sure it's b/c they're still smoothing out the rough edges
The staff was nevertheless friendly and accomodating
I LOVE this type of pizza crust--thin, sort of crisp and crackery, with just enough give
Part of the bottom of mine got just a smidgen soggy, but it was still yummy
And you can tell the ingredients were fresh
I'd like to come back in a few weeks to see if anything's improved
That said, Otto has promise, and c'mon, Mario Battali is one of the owners! This is NOT a mozzi sticks-and-chicken parm type of place!
I was disappointed in Otto
I live in the neighborhood and am a fan of Babbo and Lupa
I found the space and the service to be nice, but the pizza was so- so, and the crust was tough
The sides were similar to those offered at Lupa and I prefer Lupa's
Wines are good, but the list is hard to pick from if you are not a sommelier
Side dishes were similar to Lupa's which are great
Pizza was disappointing
Although they had decent flavor, they came a bit cold and were not filling
Althou pizzas ran around the $10 range, you would have to order quite a bit to satisfy the hunger
Saving grace: wonderful wines great service
Stopped by for a late lunch date today and was pleasantly surprised by decor and service
This is a charming restaurant and the staff are obviously interested in making a good first impression
However, their attempts to be helpful (the pizza should be eaten this way in order to fully appreciate the complex flavors, etc
) can come across as foodie snobbery to the uninitiated
I was more impressed with the wine list but have this question: why do places like Otto, Frank and Supper think that simple, relatively inexpensive menus can be paired with $150+ bottles of wine? The fact is, when my pizza bill comes out to nearly $100 for two, something is amiss
Mario continues to do what he knows best
He keeps it simple, fresh, and always interesting
Service, a little rough around the edges, but the food is so delicious you won't really want to be bothered by abnoxiously good service
The quality of food served is absolutly the finest i have ever had anywhere
The Parma proscuitto is sliced paper thin by a motorless hand crank machine, this is to avoid any excess heat melting too much fat, therefore the delicious flavor of the meat is not altered
Seafood is very fresh and deliciously seasoned
Octipus is cooked to perfection, it is not overcooked, very few chefs have mastered this
The Bufala mozzarella is smothered in flavorfull but not over powering pesto and served with roasted peppers like i've never had
We shared a variety of pizzas thin and crispy
I can rave on but i used all the space
Went here last night
The first friday it was open
By 11pm it had emptied out
Which was a shame beacuse the space is great, the service is friendly if a little slow
i mean the place was empty and it seemed to take for ever to get food, drink or the check
Food was good, but if no where near Lupa good
I am a local-so happy to have an ok new place nearby

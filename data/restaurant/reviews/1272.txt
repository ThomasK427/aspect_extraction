I highly recomend this restaurant if you want to try real BBQ done right
I just walked in off Times Square one day for a beer and tried the smoked/jerk wings
They were the best I had since Memphis in May
My buddy joined me for a rack of ribs and the biggest beef rib I've ever seen
It was moist, flaverful and super tender
We had the mac n cheese
It was pretty good with some spinach and smoked mushrooms, and the collard greens were great
They also have a really cool juke box with Merle Haggard to Leonard Skynard
It's real earthy and not as crowded as Virgils normally is
Ribs way better, too
Went for an early dinner
The place filled up as we were leaving around 5:30ish with lots of tourists
Nevertheless, the food was very good
The ribs were tender and not fatty, and you could taste the smoked flavor in the chicken
We had to ask for bread and we're glad we did: the cornbread was excellent
This is a nice little escape from the lights of Times Square and you can get a good meal for a reasonable price
Two words: cheese grits
If you've never tried them, you have to go to Spanky's
It will change your life
Two more words: dirt pie
I didn't know Oreo's and vanilla pudding could taste so good
I went with a big crowd so we got to sample a bit of everything
Of course the BBQ was delicious, but don't miss out on the crab cakes and cheesburgers
both mouthwatering
The waitress never let my glass get half empty
Good times
Went to dinner at Spanky's the other night
Literally, bit off more than we could chew
:) The portions were mammoth
The chicken wings were to die for
Incredible! Plus, the wait staff was very helpful and accomodating
A very VERY enjoyable experience
Had dinner with a few friends last night at Spanky's and it was a very enjoyable experience
Our waitress was super-friendly and service was great
I had one of the sampler dinners
highly recommend the ribs, brisket and pulled pork
And make sure to get some sides - cheese grits and mac cheese were my favorite
Frosted mugs for our pitchers of beers were nice
Jukebox downstairs also a plus
Overall good times
Went to Spanky's the other night with some friends
Two words: tree - mendous! Grade A top choice barbecue
The chicken wing appetizer was outrageous
We were literally fighting over the last one
In retrospect, that was kind of foolish, as the portions for dinner were obscene
The Royal Flush is as dangerous on your heart as it is tasty on your tongue
To top it all off, we fired up some desserts to share
The dirt pie - crushed oreo's over vanilla pudding - was as good as it sounds
All in all, Im really looking forward to my next time there
We hit up Spanky's to chow-down and catch-up, which we did better than ever at this BBQ eatery
Even with Time's Square a few steps away, we relaxed as if we were in someone's backyard, only no one had to get up to check the grill
The menu offered all the truly southern fare one could desire and between the huge portions of ribs, chicken, pulled pork, fried chicken and pork loin, I think our only regret was that we couldn't clean our plates
A variety of sauces (not for the faint of tastebud) are available to please even the pickiest of eaters
Try the fried pickles, you can't go wrong with any of the entrees, the collard greens are a must and be sure to get one of the many beers on tap
And leave room for dessert; you won't be disappointed
When I went to Spanky's, I was in the mood for real BBQ and was totally satisfied! The pulled pork sandwhich was moist and seasoned, and my friend's BBQ Chicken was also really delicious
I'd reccomend the fried pickles (trust me!) to anyone, and the fried green tomatoes were a real treat as well
Our waiter was very friendly and prompt and made sure we had everthing we needed
The ribs were tender delicious and there was SO MUCH food! The BBQ sauce was think and delicious
I especially loved the corn muffins
They have made in house desserts, which were amazing
Try the Mississippi Mud pie- it's awesome!
I've been frequenting several BBQ places in the city in search of the perfect BBQ
I'm from the Midwest so grew up on Kansas City BBQ, and have very high standards
I tried Spankys on the recommendation of a friend who swore it was top-notch bbq
I ordered the Buffalo short ribs, which were scrumptious
My girlfriend ordered the Chicken and Ribs- an immense amount of food! The chicken is smoked, and then grilled for a little so it doesn't have the sogginess that tends to come with bbq chicken
The ribs
The ribs! Very meaty! And the bbq sauce adds a great touch to every meat
The tator tots were not my favorite
Fries are great though
Even though we were stuffed, we decided to try dessert- the key lime pie and banana cream pie are both excellent- a great way to end our meal!
I came at an off hour and order a half rack of St
Louis ribs
the top four were fresh and tasted great; the bottom ones were older and dry
Next time, I'd send it back
And the ribs were great
The Tater tots were mushy, rather than crisp on outside and tender on the inside
I ould go back i a heatbeat with the hope of having more ribs like those top ones
I got a full 1/2 chicken, 4 ribs and a decent sized pile of brisket and pulled pork with a corn muffin filled with actual corn
The dark meat on the chicken was excellent, too bad the breast was a little dry
The ribs were tasty and I enjoyed the brisket a lot
The pulled pork was a tad bit sweet
The potatoes were average, but the collard greens were amazing
Overall excellent for the price, which is super cheap considering it's in Times Square
Drink the beer - they get it fresh from Heartland Brewery
Although BBQ is not my favorite food, I was pleasantly surprised after eating at Spanky's BBQ on W
43rd Street
They use an authentic smoker with applewood so the place smells great! I loved the pulled pork sandwich and the St
Louis Style ribs -delish! The atmosphere is friendly and comfortable and the service was good
I loved the Fried Pickles! The coating just gave the pickles a whole new taste - really delicious
Also - if you like spicy try the Jalepeno peppers - you will enjoy washing them down with one of the handcrafted beers served at Spanky's! My boyfriend and I thought the Pulled Pork was delicious!
I can't believe this was rated 9

Have we been so deprived of REAL barbecue in NY that we are now settling for anything? This is NOT great! I agree with others that the ribs and chicken are dry
There was practically no sauce on them
The appetizers - good
The spicy jerk wings with mango sauce make a delightful pair
My friends liked the nachos
The hell-fire ribs (on the separate menu) are good and better than the ribs on the entree menu

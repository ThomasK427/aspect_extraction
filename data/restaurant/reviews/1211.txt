We went here on a Tuesday evening and had a terrific time
The service was outstanding and the food was delicious, very reasonably priced for the quality
The ambience was perfect for a romantic evening
I highly recommend this place
Don't bother going
We sat in the party room for dinner and received no service
We had to ask for our bread
Drinks came 2 hours after they were ordered
Our meal took even longer to get there
Our food was cold and came out 2 meals at a time
My steak had so much fat, it was inedible
We complained and asked to speak to the manager, who conveniently sent a friend to talk to us instead
We were moved upstairs and all the other patrons were complaining about service and food
If you want to starve, go to Ora
Ora is a beautiful restaurant- great design, location and overall feel
The staff was friendly, helpful and informative
Food and drinks were great- perfect for a date or a group dinner
Will definitley return!
I recently hosted a party at ORA
everyone loved the tapas, and specialty cocktails
Yummy strawberry caipirinha! We really liked the unique paintings, and overall chill atmosphere
Outstanding food with impeccable service
You will love it here
We hade diner at Ora 12 of us last week and it was very festive
The food was superb and the service was attentive
The ambience was very nice
I would highly recommend this restaurant
This place has the worst service i have ever seen
What makes their service even worst, is that they do not care
If the manager or waiter responded to my complaints, reduced my bill, offered me a complimentary beverage, apologized with a reasonable answer, etc
I would not be writing this review
Do not waste your oney their
It is an excelent restaurant, the service is out of this world
There seems to be good communication amogst the staff and that gives a very good impression
Managers are very helpful and very service oriented
It is a great place to spend a wonderful time
I took a friend from out of town to Ora and we were both delighted
The Gorgonzola bruschetta is delectable as were the salads we shared
Going to Ora would be incomplete without, of course, several glasses of wine
Although the restaurant became noisier as the night went on, I found the ambience to be perfect for the mood
Don't forget, of course, to make a reservation!
well from all the reviews I expected this place to be spectacular but it wasn't
There were only a few people in there dining and the waitors were not attentive at all
They don't serve sangria, beers were warm and it took 20 minutes to get bread because they probably overheard us complaining about how slow the service was
Besides that the atmosphere of this place was romantic and the food was pretty good but still IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET THE FOOD!

It is a great experience at ora the food is incredible, the cocktails, especially kiwi caipirinha, is fabulous and the servers are very nice and friendly
The best Restaurant and Bar which I have been so far is ORA
The food is excellent and the atmosphere is very elegant
Last week I had been with a group of friends and enjoyed immensely
Also check out their desserts -- its fablous
Definetely a place to visit !!! Will see you again soon Ora
I went to Ora for dinner and what a disappointment
We ordered glasses of wine-2 white/1 red
The white wine was a dark yellow color and the red tasted like vinegar
We sent the wine back with the bartender and actually got an attitude and a hard time about it! We each ordered something different to for dinner and our order took forever to come out of the kitchen and being only 1 of the 4 tables with people in it I don't understand why
Only 2 of the dishes came out so we had to wait for the third one
Our food was barely warm! I didn't even give having coffee after dinner a thought here
The waitress was apologetic and very sweet so I suggest she find a new restaurant to work at since I don't think this one will be around for very long unless it changes
well
everything
Ora is a great choice for reasonably priced food in a relaxed atmosphere
I went for dinner with my friends one week back and left highly satisfied
The inside is loungy and the music is pleasant on a nice evening
For an appetizer we had Grilled Shrimp Salad with Cucumber, Tomato and Black Olives which was amazing and perfectly cooked
For an entree I had the Slow baked Salmon with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Haricots Verts
The fish was so tasty that I wanted to have once more
While my friends had Braised Lamb Shank, Roasted Free Range Chicken and Spaghetti which were amazing too
The portions were so big that after a cocktail drink we had no room left for desert
You should check out their cocktails
its very good
Can't wait to visit Ora again
Worth the Visit !!!!
I had a great experience at Ora
My food was excellent and my server was polished and attentive
Good wine list
Decent cocktails
The atmosphere is fun -- dark, pulsing, basement room; a place where you feel like you can relax
I would return with out-of-town guests
My one complaint: Even though we arrived at our reservation time, the host asked us to wait at the bar -- then forgot to seat us (I had to ask)
She was apologetic and embarrassed (we were then seated right away)
Finally a good neighborhood restaurant
My friends and I go to Ora about once a week
We always sit outside and have cocktails
The cocktails are so fruity and perfect for the summer
Definitely a cool place to go for the summer
Went for a weekday lunch with 10 people
Only 2 other diners in the place
It took almost an hour after we ordered for our food to arrive
One of the well-done burgers was rare
The four Grilled Merguez sandwiches ordered were all missing the tapenade spread
When informed, the waiter brought out a small plate of it and said that's all they had left
The menu on the website is very different from the real menu, which was more like the website takeout menu but with less items
All that and I haven't even mentioned that there was a leak in the roof that dripped water onto one of the place settings
Waiters tried but the overall service/food was terrible
We must have waited for over an hour for our main course

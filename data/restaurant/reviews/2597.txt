One complaint I have about most restaurants is it takes forever to get help or the check at the end
I went with my boyfriend and we both enjoyed our meal and the presence of our staff, and as soon as we were done, they gave us the check right away! We felt very welcomed and we will go back there again!
The Scene Every night's a party at this flamboyant bistro in the Broadway theater district
The irrepressible host, Jean-Claude Baker, has created a living homage to his stepmother, Josephine Baker, the chanteuse who was the toast of Paris in the '20s
Broadway musicians occasionally drop in to take over the piano--Harry Connick Jr
was the house crooner here for a year--or break out in song
The Food Opt for the lusty specialties like choucroute garni(sauerkraut with white sausages and potatoes); boudin noir (pork and blood sausages) with sauteed apples, red cabbage and french fries; or goat cheese ravioli in a light veal stock
Steak au poivre can be tough one night, better the next
Standard bistro desserts hold few surprises, but they are satisfying, especially the textbook creme brulee and intense cappuccino mousse
When the person you're with leans across the table and tells you she really likes this place, you know you made a good choice and hope the rest of the meal turns out to be as good
It did
I had the filet au poivre, she had the duck
The tables are a little close together (which is ok because she can talk to me and listen to everyone else at the same time)
The fellow to her right admired her dish, so she cut him off a piece of the just delivered and uneaten duck and placed it on his dish
The piano player kept playing until midnight - we had arrived after the show to eat there, so a late dinner was fine and the ambiance was great
The service was great and unexpectedly professional and attentive, the people/guests were friendly and conversive
We're going back
Looking for the typical American dining experience (order within 5 minutes, leave in less than 1/2 hour) - dont go there
Want a great dining experience like in France of Italy - yes, make a reservation!!!  Food: well prepared, tasty, flavors fresh and appealing
Summer menu excellent value for money
Wine List: Impressive wine list
Excellent selection of wines you don't find everythere (e
g
gems from South Africa)
Some half bottles
Highly knowledgable, still not arrogant Sommelier
Some of the bottles attractively priced, others obviously too high (for those primarily focusing on prestige of wine)
Bar: great selection of Aperitives (they even know what Dry Sherry is) and Digestives
Impressive selection Single Malts from Scotland
Overall dining experience: very relaxing
It is not about getting your stomach filled quickly, but enjoying the flavors in a nice, relaxing environment, and having great conversation in the meantime
Overall: highly recommendable!!!
I'm so sad
I really wanted to like this place
The food was mediocre, at best
two of my guest ordered the fried chicken
I had the NY strip au poivre, and one guest had th risotto with strimp
We all had wine
My pinot noir was moldy tasting
The steak, although cooked properly came with an odd tasting au poivre sauce
The fried chicken was unexplicably boneless and overly breaded
There is a very limited menu, and you would think the restaurant would be able to get it right
I did like the atmosphere
There was live music and sort of a dark bordello like decor
With really good food, this place would be an asset to the theatre district
The host Jean Claude, was a true NY experience in his red silk mandarin top and black leather pants
I wanted to love it, but the food ruined it
If you can't be in Paris, Chez Josephine is a perfect substitute
From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, and you won't want to, everything about Josephine is magnifique
It is unforgettable in every way, from the attentive wait staff to the sinfully delicious food to charming Jean-Claude Baker himself
The music, live and recorded, is plus perfect from the talent of the pianist and his choice of tunes to the sound level which is so conducive to intimate conversation over the candlight
My wife and I have been to Chez Josephie almost since it opened
Although not as frequently as we would like, each time we have been treated as a guest,not as a customer
Even just to stop for a drink and canape at the bar is a joy, and makes our trip to New York complete
Chez Josephine is not only an amazing restaurant that everyone of all styles of life dine but a restaurant that pays tribute to the late Josephine Baker
The owner/adopted son of the Josephine (Jean-Claude) sits with you and talks with you as if you are an old friend
The romantic atmosphere of the decor is perfect with the piano player in the background singing songs of yesterdays past
The meal is a sin because it is so good from the spaghetti and meatballs to the mothers famous fried chicken
Josephine Baker would be proud to have her name on such an colorful restaurant
Chez Josephine is the epitome of what New York and New Yorkers are all about
It is a warm and friendly atmosphere with the nicest of people and finest of food! The service is topped by none other and it is my all time favorite
One of Manhattans best kept secrets!
I hosted a small birthday party at the restaurant a few weeks ago and it turned out fabulous! The food was excellent and the service was wonderful
We sat next to the piano and it wasn't too loud
The pianist even took requests! By the way, he was the composer and singer for the music on the show The Wedding Story
Jean-Claude was the perfect host and we even bought his book on Josephine Baker (which he signed for all of us)
I would highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion
First of all, there should be three $'s on this one
We didn't have alcohol oror dessert and our meal was almost $100 with tip for the two of us
The food was wonderful (I had grilled mahi mahi, my husband had the crab cakes)
My meal was done perfectly, but the mashed potatoes were a bit salty
The lobster bisque was to die for! We were seated next to the piano and was not at all too loud for conversation
However, the tables are so close together that you can't have a conversation without sharing it with your neighbor
(There is only 3 inches between tables, literally! They have to pull out the table so you can sit down!) But, all in all, it was a great experience
I went to Chez Josephine last summer and it was excellent
When we arrived we were immediately seated
We had an EXCELLENT server who was very knowledgable about the restaurant and the city
Our food was great
There was even a guy who came around to wipe crumbs from the table
The owner walked around and talked to guests
Overall it was great and I cant wait to go back again! It was slightly overpriced but defintely not too bad
A great favorite right in the heart of the Theater District
Great food and live music
The kitchen is open until late
The staff is attentive and makes sure you get to your show on time
Try the layered apple, rhubarb crepe cake for desert
The Crme Brulee will make you think of 42nd street in a totally different way
This restaurant left everything to be desired, especially the food
For the money they charge you including a 20% gratuity which they include in your bill (Valentines Day evening) and the mandatory deposit they make you leave in addition to the inflated bill, you are better off going to Le Cirque
The food at Le Cirque runs circles around this dingy little classless dive and at Le Cirque, they will treat you like royalty for the same price they charge at Chez Josephine minus the rolling eyes, lack of service, and overall snobby attitudes
My girlfriend and I who have both lived in Paris for years went here for Valentines Day and were disgusted at the unimaginative, remedial quality of the food
It is a loud, crowded, overpriced place with bad entertainers, lousy waiters, bad food and bad attitudes! Save yourself the trip, you will regret it
This restaurant should not be rated $$
If you plan to have a nice 3-course dinner, expect to pay $100 or more for 2 people
The cheapest entree is $18 with the average price of 22-23
The cheapest salad is $8
Deserts are $7
Soup is $7
50
If money is not an issue for you, this place is very nice and romantic, the service is good, and the food is very tasty

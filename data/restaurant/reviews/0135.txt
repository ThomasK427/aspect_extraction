It stocks the Greek coffee-shop standards: coffees, pastries, sandwiches and salads at reasonable prices for its youngish clientele
Its only advantage is its location, which is 2 blocks from the N Train
I have yet to try their desserts, but the food was average
And don't get me started on the service
The staff made me feel like I didn't belong there
Good customer service means nothing to them
Go to Omonia Cafe for desserts
The staff is unassuming and friendly, and the desserts [baklava, truffles, etc
] are worth the trip
Take the N to Broadway
Best of all, the wedding cake from My Big Fat Greek Wedding was made there! Poly evgefstos [Very delicious]!
Two brewed coffees over ice, and a lemonde, commands $14 from this place? Not including the tip for our server, who we saw twice in an hour? No thanks
The atmosphere would be enjoyable if the service didn't suck so bad
The desserts are lackluster but large, if you're going to bother, pay the same amount for something that will fill you up a little and skip the grossly overpriced beverages
I personally won't be visiting this place again
Ridiculous
You should really plan your evening around a trip to this place
The desserts were certainly good, albeit not spectacular, and large servings came with relatively low price tags
The coffee wasn't bad, though i'm not a coffee drinker, and they'll sweeten it based on your direction
The sandwiches are nothing special, but honestly, you weren't going here for the sandwiches anyway
The problem is that if you want anything to continue the meal, if you need an extra minute to go over the menu, or if, horrors, you want the check, you might be in for a lengthy wait
They expect you to stretch your chill session to the wee hours of the evening, like a good greek would, practically becoming a part of their popular-looking visage
I once waited ten minutes for change
[review cut for citysearch space constraints]
The Scene Even though the restaurant can seat more than 100, the dining room still feels intimate, especially the candle-lit leather-lined booths
Pools of darkness abound, perhaps to allow the licking of a bloody paw when no one is looking
The music is more Moby than Sinatra, and you're just as likely to see a table of 20-somethings work a cheese fondue as a table of suits ordering magnums of Bordeaux
The Food The menu is a paper buffet--pick your cut of meat, dress it in either a sauce or a baked-on chapeau and then pick "accessories," such as Yukon gold mashed potatoes, bitter greens or wilted tomatoes with blue cheese
Meat-wise, it's all here, from rib-eye to the wonderful Argentine filet mignon to the mammoth Porterhouse
Cuts are hefty and juicy across the board
Took my dad here for fathers day
It was hot inside and they didnt kno why their AC was broken
Everything was average, nothing spectacular
The steaks and the seafood were good but definitely did not merit the inflated prices
The ribeye chocolate dessert was cute, but again lacking
Definitely romantic and a nice space
A very disappointing experience
The filet mignon was dry and overpriced
I left the restaurant thinking that I should have gone to Outback Steakhouse and I hate Outback
Everyone should go here for the experience alone
The steak and pork are excellent
The salad bar is good
The bananas, black beans and rice, along with polenta are very good
The service is excellent
Every minute, there was someone bringing a different selection of steak or pork
My favorite is the sirloin and the breaded pork
You will be very full when leaving
I have to say
it keeps me coming back
The fondue is awesome and I love the diversity of the wine list
I brought my parents here when they visited the city because it does have that something special
I usually am so full by the time the meal comes that I don't eat much of it but that being said I think the Wellington is amazing and a definite must have!!!
With the previous reviewer
Good not great, and I have had better
Visited NYC for the second time from Ohio
Four of us had dinner here
My filet was perfect I will say and priced accordingly
My salad, however, was not much of a salad, a tomatoe, and cheese, and I paid 16 bucks for it
Way over priced
The building was so hot, we had trouble enjoying the meal
Over all, I would recommend this for a visit, but maybe they were having an off night, as everything seemed to fall slightly below our expectations
We have had better in NYC and much better here in Ohio
Our reservation was honored, and we were sat immediately
I enjoyed my expreience at DP
The staff was friendly and helpful
The setup and overall feel is great
Wonderful hip music played in the background
The appitizers were excellent
But when it came down to the steak, it wasn't the best I ever had
I split the porterhouse with my wife and it was tasty, but for the money we paid it should have been much larger and a better piece of meat
DP was nice and the food was good, but the place is very ecpensive and if your gonna pay that kind of money there are better steakhouses in the city
Forget about Peter Luger's Morton's, Dylan Prime is the best steakhouse in NY
I've been there 5 times now in the past month and a half and can't stop going
For appetizers I recommend the Fondue with beef tips
They come with fried bacon and onion as a rub, as well
I also suggest the charred foie gras with grapes (if they have it that day)
For a meal, I always get the 11oz
filet mignon with foie gras butter and the black pepper sauce (although the house steak sauce is also great) as well as a side of fries
The Lemoncello maple syrup martinis are the best in NY
Most meals for two seem to come to around $200 after tip which isn't bad considering the quality
You know when you want a really good steak, but you also want to go somewhere the ambience is a little less testoserone driven, well the options were few and far between, before I found this gem! We go there often, and have never been disappointed! The fondue is amazing, as are all of the cuts of meat! We had some friends meet us there and they brought their two small children, I was worried that the staff would be snooty about the kids, but they were extremely accomidating and just as professional and plesant as always! The connected bar/lounge, is a great option for a more casual night
Oh
their wine selection is top-notch, as are their cocktails!! Highly recommended!!
I have been here about 6 times
Each time the food and service were excellent
The wine list is one of the best around
The fondue with steak tips is highly recommended
You cannot go wrong here
This remains the finest resturant in the city
I have dined here so many times with clients, family, and friends and have never been disappointed by the food, the service, the atmosphere, or the overall experience
I love it!
I really love Dylan Prime, and I wish that they would honor my reservations
I have been there 5 times now and each time, I had a reservation
They immediately direct you to the bar where you spend 40 bucks on drinks waiting for your table
Next time I will make my reservation for 8 if I want to eat at 9 and have a snack first
And forget Valentines day, what a debaucle, an hour long wait past our reservation time
When you do get to order, make sure you order a filet mignon with a parmesan chapeaux, my favorite
And their side dishes are great
We came here for dinner in a group of six
They sat us at a table which could accommodate ten

Sometimes it gets too loud we couldn't hear each other
For the price they charge, they could have provided more comfort and intimacyfor the customers
Food was at least not bland
But the mis-matched combination of the ingredients and sauces made it difficult to concentrate on the dish as a whole
Maybe trying too hard to be complicated??   Wait staffs were OK but not sincere
Some couldn't wait for us to leave; keep trying to snatch the tea cups away from us when we were still drinlking them
Overall, uncomfortable and puzzling experience
My two best friends took me to Cafe Gray for my birthday and by the end of the dinner, they were apologizing for the poor service and so-so food
Considering that we have dined at 4 or 5 TOP rated restaurants before (i
e
Bouley, Kraft, etc
), Cafe Gray was a big time let down
We had to ask the staff to clear our plates, services was adequate but not exceptional
I could have taken a short nap between courses because service was soooo slow
The food was not as fantastic as the food critics hyped it to be
We even tried 4 desserts and they were all medicore at best - nothing to write home about
The decor is like a Las Vegas lounge in the 60s/70s
What a waste of a terrific view of the park
In the end, save your bucks for better places
Very pretentious
There is more emphasis on pretty food than edible food (for example the salad that comes as a bunch of leaves standing straight up wrapped in a pastry band with nothing else but a drizzle of dressing)
Some of the food was good (the TINY ravioli appetizer) but the rest was average if not way below
Do not recommend
Tasting menu was amazing
view was fine I don't know what people are complaining about - and can't see much at night anyway
place was very nice
Compared to some of the other new celebritychef places - its almost a bargain
Beautiful space
Service was fine
Unfortunately, the food was oversauced and uninspired
Our risotto was unappealingly undercooked -- not just a few grains, but many many bits so that it was like eating a dish of gravel
Their coffee was flat-out undrinkable, and I am one who is willing to drink both the junk served at those street coffee carts as well as at La Colombe, so I have high tolerance
The bright point of dinner was dessrt
The ice cream/sorbet assortment was lovely and the Jack Daniel cheesecake was fantastic -- ethereal and light
What a HUGE contrast to our dinners which were overdone and a jumble of undistinguishable flavors
The desserts nearly made us forget how blah the rest of the meal was
A disappointment, despite a lovely and warm reception by the head hostess
Come here for dessert and to see the pretty Lavendar Bar
Eat elsewhere
Not a Cafe nor a Bistro, Cafe Gray is an experience
Unfortunately it is not a good one
The tables are close together and the wait staff doesn't bother to pull the table out to seat diners, they have to squeeze between the tables
The sauces are excellent but don't go with the dishes
Yoguart/mint/jalipeno sauce for instance didn't work with asparagus
The chicken broth didn't work with the sea bass
I'm used to french food, and the portions here were miniscule
The bread was good
A serious flaw is the timing of the kitchen
We arrived at 5:30 and had leave at 7:30 without dessert or coffee because the kitchen took insanely long between courses
The wine steward also was about to attempt to pour a wine into a glass that had already been used for another wine
We sat crunched cafeteria style between 2 couples' tables and could not hear our own conversation
Since the kitchen tables were unoccupied, we asked the maitre d' if we could move and were refused
The wine was good, but the Shrimp Salad appetizer was bland and unexciting
Our entrees, Grilled Striped Sea Bass and Sauted Skate, arrived
Our waiter, however, failed to inform my wife that her skate was breaded and sauted and had the appearance of being fried
She sent it back and ordered the Grilled Striped Sea Bass, which was mediocre
We mentioned to the manager that the staff should be more accommodating
The total price of 2 glasses of wine, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees plus tax = $109
28
We told the manager that it was the first and last time we would dine at Cafe Gray
Word to the wise: Please, spend your hard-earned money elsewhere!
If you want great food, bad service and a terrible view Caf Gray if the place for you
We checked in before or 8:00 PM reservation and were not seated until 8:35
Keep in mind this was on a Tuesday and we were told people have waited 1 hours for a table on a weekend, with a reservation
Once we were seated our water order was taken promptly but they never came back with a menu
We finally had to ask for a menu and bread
One of the wait staff (not sure who he was as they have too many) had an attitude as he walked away when we told him the wine still was not cold enough
The ambience is sub par with cheesy mirrors on all walls and a bad refection on the window behind the kitchen, which blocks your view to Central Park
I went to Cafe Grey with memoires of wonderful meals at Lespinasse
From the moment I arrived, I realized that Lespinasse was a memory
The service was arrogant, bringing the entree when we were 1/2 finished with the appetizer
When my dining partner asked what the waiter would recommend for dessert, the waiter was taken aback saying everything is perfection, well, everything wasn't perfection and at $200 per person there are dozens if not hundreds of restaurants in Manhattan that are a better value
I'd NEVER return here
I am so disappointed
First, the atmopshere was far from appealing: not sexy, not inviting and surely not full of beautiful people
Why was the kitchen in front of the windows? Things got worse with the food
The risotto appetizer was tasty but too filling
We were disappointed with the food: the turbino was way too fishy, an the tiny piece of lobster tail (lobster salad) managed to be slimey and unappetizing; we tried bland short ribs, overcooked venison and a greasy pork belly
Things went from bad to awful with dessert
Desperate to find something good about the meal, we ordered all four chocolate desserts
We didn't finish any of them either
A friend and I walked into Cafe Grey at 8pm on a Thursday and the place was packed
We had a glass of a great Rhone red in the brasserie and 10 minutes later, we nabbed a corner booth
It's first-come-first-served in the bar w/ the full dinner menu
Our waiter was so good, when I asked him to write down the wine, he took a label off a bottle, put it on a cafe grey postcard, and laminated it for me
Even better, each course was completely delicious
The mushroom risotto, a house specialty, is probably the best I've ever had
Also, the braised short ribs were melt in your mouth good
really all of the cuisine was simply phenomenal
Due to the price, it's probably more of a special occasion place for most, but do not worry, if you decide to go, you will have a great experience
The space is simply beautiful
end of story
Service very professional but not cold and antiseptic like a Jean Georges
When i initially looked at the menu, i wasn't terribly excited by the dishes and the preparations were heavily tilted twds austria -- austrian food isn't exactly the thing you're starving for on a desert island
but each course turned out way better than the descriptions
just masterful
ask for a seat next to the kitchen too -- interestingly, the kitchen, in an egalitarian twist, occupies the entire window face looking into central park
we also got to chat with kunz and this guy is pure class
Cafe Gray is a restaurant that doesn't know what it wants to be
The food is good solid bistro fare

All in all, for the price I was very much dissapointed and will not go back
I've been to both locations a couple of times and the food is amazing
That said, this place will cost you 50 per person to sit down, not including drinks--and a refill of your diet coke is going to be another 4
00
So, unless you have real money to burn on dinner, I would not suggest this
It's not romantic
It's a place where finance men and lawyers take their brothers, fathers, mothers from the south and bachelor parties
If you like meat and have a big appetite, then this is definitely the place for you
They have a really good salad/appetizer bar with everything from salads, to pastas, to sushi, to paella
EVERYTHING!! Then with your meal, you get all these sides, like steamed veggies, rice, mashed potatoes, and these really good fried bananas
Then the meat just keeps coming and coming
Its very pricey so go HUNGRY and get your moneys worth!! I say splurge on the dessert, they have a cart with an excellent selection
I recommend the Coconut cake
GO HUNGRY!! BRING MAJOR CREDIT CARD!!
My fiance and I don't agree on much - especially when it comes to food, but we both LOVE this restaurant
Twice a year we drive into Manhattan (once for his birthday and once for mine) and treat ourselves to a truly wonderful meal
The garage across the street gives discounts to Plataforma patrons
We've always made a reservation, and have never had a problem being seated almost immediately
Waiters circle the room with HUGE hunks of meat and you can eat AS MUCH AS YOU WANT
well, as much as you can that is
You change your coaster from red to green (green meaning - BRING ON THE MEAT!!) (I'm such a carnivore)  The sides are pretty great too - I love the bananas and mashed potatoes
My only regret is that our time there seems to go so fast!! I wish I could stay green for longer
Churrascaria Platforma is the ideal place for celebrations
The savvy diner should just know the come hungry and not fill up on the salad bar
It will be there during and after you try the meats so no need to hit it up immediately
Keep in mind drinks and dessert are not included in the basic price as it says on the table!  I came on a Saturday night with a reservation and 6 people
Unfortunately, it took over an hour to be seated
However the manager came over and aplogized and all drinks were on him
It was really surprising as most restaurants in NY show no remorse for not honoring a reservation
Food was definitely above average
Band was a little loud, but not an ordeal
Definitely recommended
At $45 a person for dinner, CP is not worth the money unless you are a incredible glutton who hasn't eaten for a while
Priced at $27 a head in 2001, the price of admission has soared 60% in three years
The meat is prepared very plainly and varies in quality
In other words, not every cut you have will be THE best you've ever tasted
The buffet is nice but not for $45
Two cautionary notes: bad date spot! Large groups of gluttons come here to dine and watching the feeding frenzy is hardly romantic
Second caution: order nothing from the bar
Tiny Caipirinhas cost $8
50 a pop!!   All in all, if you want to spend this much money, you can get better ambience and more refined food elsewhere
CP should trim its prices
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I've been to numerous Brazilian restaurants and this by far the BEST I've ever been to
It's better than some Brazilian restaurants in Brazil!! It's just a great atmosphere, with great live music
The staff is very polite
This place has something for everyone
I'm a complete carnivore and my boyfriend is a vegetarian
We think it's fabulous how a steak how tries to accomodated different tates
OH try the Brazilian desserts
They are yummy!!
Don't overload at the salad bar because there is lots more to come! My Brazilian friends say this is pretty authentic
All the meats are wonderful, the salmon and turkey are great for the no red meat crowd
The sausage is terrific I don't usually eat it
For a special treat ask for the garlic steak
Good for groups because there is something for everyone
The vegitarians can make a meal of the salad bar
Try the sides, they are interesting
This is one New York restaurant that won't disappoint
Last word of advice go easy on the capharinas!!
Recently back from Brazil my wife and I wanted to relive my dining experience of a Brazilian Steakhouse
With high hopes and low expectations we can to Churrasaria Platforma and were totally blown away!  This resturant has the best Beef, Pork and Lamb I have had in the city
Salad Station has fresh ingredients and beautiful presentation
Waiters with meat cooked on a swoard circle the dining room to keep patrons happy
coaster that is red and green identifies if you yant more or to pass you by
Try the Brazilian drink, Caiparinnia (Pitu, lime, sugar and ice) they won't dissappoint
as we all know, brazillians make great meat, but churrascaria plataforma is the best steak in the city
if you want a steak with great flavor and original seasoning, go there
it is worth the trip
If you never been in Brasil, this is your chance to see and fell like you are there!! Friendly people all over, health food, taste like no other
If you are hungry for meat, you will find all kinds
If you just want seafood is there also
Try the seafood salad - It's unbeliveble! And for desert you got have the ACAI
Don't loose a chance to have a nice dinner - Plataforma is the best !!!
Went on a Saturday
Was able to call in and set a reservation and got seated immediately
I think everyone else had a problem because their reservations were during the dinner rush
My friend and I arrived around 630pm
Food wise: Salad bar is excellent
Even had sushii to choose from  Meats: All types of meat to choose from
Favorite was the lamb and sterlion steak  Dessert was extra which was disappointing
Wasnt really rush, but I can see how a lot of people are saying they were
Was it worth the $65
00 I spent? Yes
Would I do it again? Probably  Seating: I can see how some readers said it was tight
My friend and I got a table that could seat 4
Overall: i give it and 8

Everything's impressive about this place
The sheer quantity of food, the size of the space, the attentive service
I could go on and on
You've got to love meat and you've got to go with a group large enough to order capirinhas by the pitcher
If you're careful with your drinking/desserts, you can even manage to spend around $60 a head all told (It's $38 for the buffet/meat)
If you're into wine and after-dinner drinks you'll end up with a tab closer to $110
I have my b-day party here every year
Great place to indulge and have a fantastic, unintimate (don't go on a date here) time
I've been here 2-3 times and everytime I come out, I swear off meat for six months
You definitely get your money's worth
It's true that it's noisy and crowded, but what do you expect when the food is THAT good at THAT price in the middle of NYC? Come on an empty stomach, wear your stretchy pants and don't forget the Febreze
I like this place, I really do, but check this out
I have been to most of the top rated restaurants in the city (Daniel, Alain Duccasse, Nobu, etc)

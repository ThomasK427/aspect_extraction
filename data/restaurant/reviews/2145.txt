Well, I agree that the service was not bad -- they are all pros and seemed like they have been in the business for decades, literally
As for the food, it was very disappointing
One of the appetizers we had was portabello mushroom and it looked so sorry (didn't taste much better either)
I had angel hair w/ shrimp in some red sauce, and let's just say I can cook better than that (and all the cooking I can do is w/ a microwave)
As for my friends' dinners, they didn't seem to care for them either
Don't just take my word for it -- we went on a pleasantly cool autumn Friday night and the restaurant was only half-filled, if that much
I totally loved this place
Decor is totally from another era
Isn't that Sammy Frank and the rest of the ratpack knocking back highballs in the lounge? Very warm though, with lots of stained glass
The food is out of this world, especially the giant veal chop that I had
I never saw anything like it
My wife had a zuppa di pesce which--she claims--was the finest seafood dish she has ever had
Ask for Livio the waiter
He is so smoooooth!!
While visiting NYC this summer, we came across Domenico's and we were absolutely amazed
The entire place is out of this world! The food and people are the greatest
The staff is very accomodating
They make your dining experience the way most restaurants would like to be
If you want a great place to eat and relax - go to Domenico's
This restaurant is EXCELLENT - wonderful experienced waitstaff
Very tiny secluded - great place to go on a date
We had a wonderful dinner - great appetizers, main course desert
good wine menu
Not crowded at all
Excellent food and excellent service
Professional waiters presenting smartly and pleasantly
Veal chop is the best in the City, as well as their steaks and seafood
Have been dining there for over 17 years and will keep going back
We happened to find this wonderful place by accident on our last trip to NYC
The food was outstanding, the atmosphere extremely relaxing and the service outstanding
I cannot wait to return
I was staying at Doral with some friends and we went on a saturday night to dine at Rossini's
It was one of our best meals yet, the service was impecable and the opera trio just great
if you ever go ask for Peter or Sherman, they're both really good waiters (funny too!), and ladies, they look just great in their tailored tuxedoes!
In Short Old-school McCormack's hosts a crowd of shepherd's pie devotees from late afternoon to late night
In the evening, the friendly crew of bartenders makes it a popular pub for slurping Irish stew and Guinness alike
Some neighborhood regulars are permanent fixtures at the old wood bar, while an energetic younger crowd floods in after work
It get's really crowded on St
Pat's, but this place really is a great find
The bartenders are friendly and seem to know everyone in the place
The food really is first rate as far as Pubs go
Make every effort to visit if you're in the area
I love this place and I have hesitated to write a review for that reason- I do not want it to get too crowded
After reading the other reviews, however I feel that I must
Owen and Paul, behind the bar, are two of the best guys
The first visit they were nice and talkative
By the second visit they knew my name and greet me and my friends with a big smile and hello every time
The food is great and the menu is larger than you would guess at first glance of the bar
If you are looking for a pub this is the place
I think the problems people have found at McCormack's is not bad servers, but over-worked servers
They generally don't have enough people working
When it's not too busy, they're very pleasant and proactive
However, I find that when the place fills up, the one or two who are there get very harried and very taxed
Unlike most wine-oriented restaurants, McCormack's diners send these girls to the bar constantly looking for more drinks, which really puts a strain on these girls in addition to their regular duties
Also, I don't remember seeing a whole lot of busboys either
That being said, the food is really just barfood, although they have a lot of specials so you have some variety
Decor is OK, kinda comfortable
I couldn't believe someone else rated the staff as a let-down
Michael is at the bar and he's absolutely wonderful! Everyone that works there is from Ireland, and you really feel you're there
There's nothing better than their fries and a pint of Guiness
please check it out!
This local Irish favorite boasts solid basic pub fare and a page full of daily special, friendly Irish staff and management, and a great selections of stouts, ales, beers and mixed drinks
The large bar is great for gathering with friends to watch sports (most major soccer, football and rugby matches can be seen here) and the restaurant area is conveniently separated from the bar area to allow for a comfortable, relatively quiet meal
The weekend brunch offers your selection of omelets, corn beef hash eggs, Eggs Benedict, a hearty Irish Breakfast and other specialties, along with coffee and two drinks all for about $10
The juke box features a good selection of pop CDs along with plenty of Irish standards
Check it out
Its worth an evening at least
A nice bar with good food and proper sports
Unfortunatley my four or so visits have been spoiled by the rude staff twice
Once the waitress cursed our table for not tipping enough after we had waited an hour to order and another half an hour just to get a drink, on top of this I had to find my own cutlery
she was lucky to get any tip
The other time we were over charged by the waiter who refused to accept his error even though we had been charged for 5 mains, and there was only 4 of us
The only reasons I return is for the rugby and the cooked english breakfast
Our four were seated promptly at the back on a busy Friday night, around 8:45pm
We told the waitress a few more were coming and ordered drinks
Two more arrived, but the waitress never returned! We kindly asked the manager to get her when he checked on another table, and he disappeared too
An HOUR after we arrived, our birthday party was now hungry, thirsty, angry, and late for our comedy show
We hunted the waitress to at least pay for the drinks
She complained to us and again to her manager that wed dirtied the dishes and left without ordering anything
I told her that for us to dirty the dishes, shed have needed to take our order
A group of us were lured to this place by the $1 happy hour beers but we stayed for the addictive quick draw machine that takes up the entire south wall
There is a motley mix of clientele at this place
We started the evening sitting next to a couple of hotties from the neighborhood but soon found ourselves overwhelmed by a chatty mobile home salesman with blackened teeth and a thinning mullet from Long Island
My only complaint is the hot chicks rotate out of the bar to quickly while the mobile home salesmen do not
Wanda's kicks ass
it's as simple as that
The chicks that bartend there are the hottest thing since sunburn was invented
They make awesome martini's and they have the best crowd in town
If you like middle aged overweight people with lots of cavities and gum decay
then this is your spot
I reccomend it highly
This place is black tie optional, and bad breath maditory
Food is cold and not fresh Service is worse
I would recommend finding a different place for middle eastern
I went with my Persian boyfriend in early July 2002, based on the high Citysearch rating
There was only one other party in the restaurant, a Persian family
A/C wasn't turned on (very stuffy) and only one server
When we noticed that the other party sent back their food, we asked them about it
They said the rice wasn't fresh and was probably recycled and the tea wasn't hot
So we left without eating anything

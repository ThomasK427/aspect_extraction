the service was great and the wine list is a very reasonable
I recommend the $30 pre-fix
Try the chocolate cake!  Not only did we have a great meal but we were given scones for breakfast when we left!!!
3- course prix fixe at $30
00!!!!!!!! Great value
Large portions
Check it out
Recommended by friends, (we are from NJ)
We were extremely pleased
The atmosphere is sophisticated, the staff is on top of your every need and then some
The food was excellent
We had a loveley evening and a great dining experience and loved it!
My wife and I celebrated our 9th wedding anniversary 6/26 at this new addition to the West Side dining scene
Compass features a beautifully designed space, excellent food, service that earns every dollar of your tip, a wine selection to please everyone, and you won't have to break the bank to enjoy it! Go before it becomes impossible to get a table
As starters, we had the Maine Diver Sea Scallops in Lobster-Carrot Broth and the Copper River Salmon Confit
Two hefty pan-seared scallops were floating in a gentle coral-colored broth
They literally melted in our mouths
The Salmon Confit is the best! It is prepared by dipping the salmon in a very high heated pan so that the exterior sizzles and cooks on the surface while the interior remains rare
The Chef placed this beautiful piece of salmon on top of a layer of shredded herbs and sliced gooseberries with an exquistely fried foie gras as an ornament
A dark burgundy sauce was artistically drizzled around the plate
A knife is not necessary to eat this dish because the soft salmon just slowly falls apart with the pressure from the fork
When you pair each of the ingredients up--All of the flavors just meld together and you experience culinary ecstacy!
gorgeous interior - delicious food - and fantastic staff
a truly great new restaurant!!!! tuna carpacio was super-fresh!!!
We ate here on Saturday
The restaurant was only about 75% full
Food was excellent, interior is really modern and sleek looking, service was excellent
Plenty of tasting extras were given to diners
I can't understand why it hasn't becaome more popular or rated higher
One thought comes to mind, fabulous
Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable
The food was fantastic, and the setting was very cool
A great restaurant in a great neighborhood
I made rez's for two, but we get a table for four, with twice the room
I don't know what beer to order
Waiter suggests a beer, and offers to bring a small glass, to taste it and see if I like it, before I even order the beer! We order the $30 pre-fixe 3-course chef's dinner
The dinner is full of wonderful little complimentary gifts from the chef
The pace is unhurried - three full hours
Delicious food - the fritters with red pepper coulis is a must
And the check was very reasonable, especially for new york
$90 for a three course meal for two, plus drinks
Wonderful evening, highly recommended
Fresh Fresh Fresh! food is outstanding, and w/ all the over priced blah Italian places in NYC this one is a stand out
We went for brunch on Sunday morning after staying the weekend @ near by hotel
Service was fantastic, my fritata was perfection
By far the most satisfying meal of the entire weekend
We keep on going back and have recomended it to several friends, they love it too!
My husband and I happened into this place before going to a party in Tribeca
We were escorted to our seat (outside on the sidewalk next to the pretty brush)
The owner came out waving his arms and getting mad at us for sitting there saying it was reserved
We comely said no problem, we were told to sit there but we'll move
He was overly aggressive about the whole situation, but our waiter sided with us and had great service from him from that point forward
The Muscules were great, my goat cheese was good but was pre-made and served too cold
We both had the Gnocci and after salting it a bit, it was delicious and light
Definitely worth a try if you're in the area
Been here a few times and have always loved it
The food is fresh (I believe all the pasta is homemade) and delicious
The amibiance is nice, condusive to groups or a more intimate setting
Our service has always been excellent
I'm sure we'll be going back here many more times
I just returned from this Restaurant
I normally don't write reviews about places, but because of the bad experience I had to share my thoughts on this mediocare place:  1
FOOD: way below average for Italian, especially in NYC
The ingredients were cheap and low quality
2
Ambiance: Prouds itself of being homey
But if that's what you want you should just stay home
3
Service: BAD! We only saw our waiter once, we he took our order
The busboys did the rest
4
Crowd: Tourists and Jersey girls
Too much big hair and not enough finess
5
Conclusion: Avoid this over-rated expensive place
i hate to be the only person who doesn't submit a 100% endorsement of this place, but i should be honest
i think the food was great, the service was great and the service was absolutely impeccable
however, i thought it was a little pricey and that the portions were a little small
overall very good though
In a city of many excellent Italian restaurants (and even more bad ones), Pepolino deserves special mention
In a casual atmosphere just outside of Soho, the very inviting staff attend to your every need as you dine on an atypical selection of Northern Italian cuisine
The food is exceptionally fresh and there is nothing on the menu that wouldn't please most culinary senses
I have to mention the meatballs - wow
The wine list is short, but provides good diversity, with several little gems (particularly the Tuscans)
And whatever you do, do not forego the cheesecake
Best in NYC
a block too far for the prada-clad crowd to trot from the trendier part of west broadway, this place is a mellow mix of romantic daters, regulars, and small groups who enjoy the great food, exceptional service, and authentically italian atmosphere
My boyfriend and I were in New York a while back
We were staying in the neighborhood and found this place to be, above and beyond, any other restaurant we visited
The food was really excellent (we ate there twice in 5 days) and the service was courteous and prompt! We still talk about it


If you hate places that are filled with pretense where you are consistently disappointed yet over-charged, love being treated like family, and enjoy wonderful northern Italian cuisine and great wine, don't miss this jewel
My wife and I first discovered this wonderful restaurant just after 9/11/01 when we were trying hard to support our downtown NYC merchants affected by the tragedy
As New Yorkers, we have our pick of literally thousands of Italian Restaurants and yet we return to this one as often as possible (all the way from the sticks of the upper eastside!) Both the food and the service are magnificient and very reasonable! My wife adore's the Spinich Soufle' and I am always pleasantly surprised by whatever is offered as a special! Get to know this restaurant - you'll be back too!
a great restaurant with authentic italian cuisine, and deserts to die for, i would definately recomend this place!!!
The Scene There's simply no pretension here
The dining room, with its terra cotta-colored walls and exposed beams, feels nicely worn-in
And the personable, easygoing servers know their stuff
The Food In contrast to the deluge of restaurants serving safe, familiar food, Chef Wylie Dufresne's dishes make you think

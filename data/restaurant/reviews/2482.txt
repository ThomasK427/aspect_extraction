When it did come out, they gave us the wrong order
Hi-Life offered huge portions - ordered Pad Thai pasta bowl special - but the food was disgusting
The noodles were all stuck together with red sticky gravy that tasted like ketchup with corn syrup
My friend ordered meatloaf with spinach on the side
He picked up the entire mound of spinach with the fork and the entire clump just stuck together mid-air
He didn't even bother with the meatloaf
The waitress was apologetic, but there was nothing she could do
I would suggest people to head elsewhere for good food
Almost don't want to share this place have it get too busy, but, Mon Tues night specials include 1/2 price sushi which is really fresh
The manager staff are excellent - very nice
Strongly recommended!
The Hi Life has been pouring the drinks for as long as I can remember
It was welcoming when I was in college, and it's still welcoming even though I'm in my 30's (but I tend not to go there on weekend nights anymore)
The bartenders will put a smile on your face, even if they won't be winning the swimsuit contest anytime soon
I have never eaten the food here, but why would I want to? The drinks are so cheap I'd rather drink my dinner
There are very few cool bars to hang out on the UWS, but the Hi Life remains on the short list so long as your not looking too upscale
A great neighbohood standard
Have been going for years, never lets you down
We go a few times a month
We have been a couple of times and the food is great
Drinks are great
A nice quaint grill for the neighborhood
Sports screen for the guys
inexpensive
This is a great neighborhood place with a very low-key but fun atmosphere and good music playing
It's also cheap
My husband's and my favorite upper west side neighborhood restaurant bar none, is thankfully not fully appreciated as I can usually get a seat in a booth or the cafe without having to wait
We love the friendly, been there forever charm, but even more important is the varied menu
I go for sushi and the chicken citrus salad, and the big guy usually has a steak and fries
This place is an old standard in the neighborhood
For its varied and rather large menu, it does just about everything pretty well
Half priced sushi nights are great but I swear the pieces are half the size on those nights
It is both a nice enough place to take someone and mellow enough to relax at the bar
There are always food and drink specials, which is also nice
The burgers are great (but used to be better when they branded it with their logo)
After the dinner crowd leaves, it becomes a bar which can get lively
Some nights there is a DJ who spins decent music
They used to have Afro Cuban Jazz nights which were cool, but I dont think they do anymore
Unassuming
kind of divy
but Jenn and Heather sure can entertain
We had a surprisingly good time and cut some rug to the fine tunes
Oh, and shots are only $3 bucks a pop on the weekends, a rare find in the city
This place is decent, but the food is just as expensive as a nice restaurant in the same neighborhood
I recommend going elsewhere if you are in the 'hood
Saturday Night Guacamole Night is the HI-Life answer to Free Rice Wine at the Chinese place nearby
It's totally killer, fresh and served with a smile by Marcie, who likes R
Kelly maybe a little too much
Anyway, the drinks were sensational and the atmosphere is cool if you like to party
the dj is also a menace on the turntables
he doesn't like R Kellly, which I think is great
The manager was also very nice and helped us find a seat at the bar- we had great seats! What's up with all the short girls from Brother Jimmy's though? They look like children and can't hold their liquor
Whatever
We had fun
HEY- If you like soap, you should go to SOAP IN THE CITY! Nothing to do with Hi-Life, I just wanted to mention it
Hi Life Bar and Grill is one of the best bars in the city!!! The bartenders, especially Heather, can always be found with smiles on their faces and a drink at the ready! The atmosphere is cool and relaxed, with a great variety of people
The food is pretty good, too, and quite inexpensive
It is particularly great on a Friday night
especially if you want to just have a few drinks and good conversation with some friends
maybe it was an off day, but we showed up at 5:30 on a blazing sunday, the place was empty
we asked the hostess if they had frozen margaritas, she checked and said yes
we said we'd take 2, and sat outside
20 minutes later we still had no drinks
we asked
and hostess, baretenders and waitresses all pointed fingers at each other
we pointed ourselves across the street to freds, where service was fast and friendly
Amazing food if you like veggie with a Japanese focus
Do not miss the Almost Perfect which is miss-named it is actually perfect
I have only been here for breakfast, but I go often for that
Everything is freshly prepared and simply delightful
Make sure you get a large fresh squeezed orange juice and be sure to try the home-made yogurt with fresh fruit
The eggs bennedict are extremely well done
I hope to try it for dinner sometime soon
The bizarre rush treatment we received led me to conclude that the place is too expensive, too odd, and too hectic
In spite of reservations, we were seated in the nearly empty dining room at a table along the well traveled path to the kitchen, making the otherwise subdued setting seem like Grand Central at rush hour, even though the place was empty
This could still be forgiven if it werent for the waiters aggressive service and the waitstaffs voracious appetite for our plates, which we had to struggle to retain before having a chance to finish
By dessert, I gave up and sat there hopelessly watching as my rice pudding was snatched away half eaten, only to be replaced immediately with a hefty bill
Please hurry up and get out of here, was the overall message, but Im certainly not in a rush to return
One of the better restaurants in the neighborhood (Upper West Side) -- and a good choice amongst the tons of Italian/Japanese/ethnic restaurants in the area
Specials are sometimes exhorbitantly priced; some say it doesn't quite have a NYC feel
Good pre-fixe / pre-theater prices
Everything looks, and is delicious on the small menu provided at this compact wreathed delight
I recommend the duck followed by passion fruit sorbet! Amazing beverage list is also offered
The Scene Handsome dark wood furnishings, black-and-white photographs and big mirrors create a classy, pseudo-maritime atmosphere at this Upper West Side outpost of the ever-expanding BR Guest chain
As with its sister Grills, Blue Water and Atlantic, Ocean Grill matches quality seafood with a bustling scene--it's always packed, yet large enough to make getting a table relatively easy on short notice
The Food The fare is reliable and reasonably priced, if not wildly inventive
Appetizers are mostly solid: Calimari is juicy, chilled beets and goat cheese salad is refreshing and caramelized onion and gruyere tart is satisfyingly crunchy, if a little bland; only an overly citrusy black bass ceviche fails to please
Standout entrees include seared rare big eye tuna (partly on account of the delicious forbidden black rice that accompanies it) and tender red snapper with a creamy celery root puree
The seafood tower is generous and very fresh
I went to Ocean Grille for dinner on New Year's Eve
We were made to wait for our table despite a reservation
The meal was really expensive totally underwhelming
The entre's were tasteless, the desserts had to much alcohol which ruined them the waitress spilled more of the champagne on the table cloth than in the glass
I definitely won't be going back
Horrible noise, thumping music
Had to ask both the hostess and the manager to put on some non-thumping music because it amplified the reverberating din of the diners
A got an annoyed I got you point, after making a very cordial request
The food was only average, but very overpriced
I can't say enough about Ocean Grill
I have taken many friends and family members to this restaurant and I never get sick of their phenomenal seafood

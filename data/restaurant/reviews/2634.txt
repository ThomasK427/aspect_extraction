The outdoor garden is a great date spot for a summer evening
Great location, good prices and nice service
Personally, I like to eat at Luxia after curtains go up, but if you need to get a good meal at a great price and then run off to a show, Luxia is a good choice
Nice bar, and really nice ambience, though a little tight for table seating
The garden is a nice touch too- but only if you are a city dweller and think that one tree is getting a garden dining experience
I'm always happy with my dinner and recently can say that Luxia has been the best part of my theater evening- God B'way blows lately
I had the pleasure of dining at Luxia on 4 occasions and have had my palate overwhelmed everytime
I have experienced a great amount of 4 and 3 star restaurants over the years in NYC and enjoyed every bit of it, but, I thoroughly appreciate a place that you can go to where you get a consistant quality of food at a comfortable price
I would also like to commend the staff for recognizing me when I come through the door
Have the Risotto, Tuna Tartare, or the seared Foie Gras with granny smith apples and shittake mushrooms
Went here for a friends birthfday
Service was great and the waitres very attentative
THe food was excellent
Try the crusted salmon
Drink are expensive
This place is excellent! I highly recommend the pear salad and the pecan crusted chicken but my friend got the lobster ravioli and that was great too
You can't get much better than finding a place where the food is yummy and they play David Gray and Jack Johnson!
I'm convinced this might be the best unknown place in the theater district
In an area of Manhattan dominated by national chains various theme restaurants, Rachel's is a breath of fresh air (especially if you sit on the backyard patio)
The servers are polite and prompt, the menu has enough variety that even my kosher friend found items to eat
This might become a pre-show fixture in my world
I went there with the intent of having a good hamburger since the menu said that they have Rachel's special ingredient
I was very disappointed and my date took a bite and couldn't eat anymore
Thursday night around 830pm walked in with my date and was seated immediately
Nice atmosphere, cozy enough for a semi-romantic time, yet casual enough for friends
The price was standard city prices and the menu had a nice selection of different tastes
I would go back again
Its tough to imagine such a quaint restaurant right around the corner from Port Authority and just up the block from the Lincoln Tunnel, but here it is
Very nice inside, great service and wonderful food - try any of the homemade pastas!
One of the premiere reasons I miss living in Hell's Kitchen is Rachels
A great romantic spot for a first date
Try the Pecan Chicken or the Fish Soup
My husband and I chose Rachel's for Pre-Theatre dining and Anniversary celebration
The restaurant definitely lived up to all of the recommendations we received from family members
The service and food were great
Both of our dinners were fantastic!! The best part was the price - we definitely got a great dinner bargain in the city!!!!
my boyfriend i were trolling around starving for lunch
we love trying new places went inside
i was immediately taken by the interior -- it reminded me of some old time restaurant when i was a child -- but it wasn't old as in falling apart moldy -- rather it's kinda like an old bistro you would find in Paris -- except not crowded
The food is plentiful delicious (not cuisine -- but really good) not expensive -- shockingly uncrowded for suuch a gem -- hence one of NYC's best kept secrets
service is nice, too
This has to be one of the worst meals I've ever had in Manhattan
All of the food was either from a can or frozen and so ridiculously overpriced
Beware of this garbage establishment that is nothing more than a mediocre trap at best
Completely awful!!!
This restaurant serves delicious bistro fare in a friendly, neighborhood environment
It is a great place to eat pre-theatre (the friendly and efficient staff makes sure you are served in plenty of time to make your show) and the new late-night happy hour from 8-10 makes is an ideal spot to stop for a drink and light meal
This place was boring
Dull atmosphere
Food was ok
Management and staff lacked excitement, and energy
although i frequent becco, i was talked into having dinner here a few weeks back while out with some family members
the meal was nothing short of outstanding
the food is great, and the price fixe option on entrees makes for a good value
i will be back
La Stanza is one of my favorite restaurants
The food is delicious and it is often hard to choose from the large selection of delectable dishes
I often order the best lobster ravioli, which is the best I've had anywhere! The matre'd is a delight and makes you feel like your a guest at his private party
There's also garden dinning in the summer
You'll never feel rushed and leave very satisfied
Make reservations on theatre nights
Affordable with excellent food
The staff is friendly and efficient
Menu items include the best lobster ravioli in town, excellent steak and pasta dishes, and a variety of desserts which are all excellent
Will definitely return in the future
Normaly I shy away from the resteraunts in the theatre area, most seem to be traveling on names and reputations earned in the 40's
Not the case with La Stanza Verde
We went on the recomendation of a relative and were not dissapointed
The room is cozy and welcoming the wait staff attentive but not over bearing the food was excellent and reasonably priced by any standards especially in NYC
Try the veal marsala the cheese cake is a gotta have and the house red is one of the best house wines I have had
They have price fixed menu which ranges from 21
95 to about 26
00 and includes appetizer,entre, desert and coffee
Check for 3 before gratuity was 100
with drinks a bargain
I was very underwhelmed with my experience at Da Rosina
I had the calamari as my appetizer, gnocchi for my main course, and the tiramasu for dessert
The calamari looked like it came straight from Applebees
The gnocchi was served with a sauce that looked like it came out of a Ragu Jar
The Tiramasu was soggy and looked like it had been sitting out all day
Plus tables are stacked on each other, the wait staff is overworked, and the decor is generic so the entire experience felt rushed and impersonal
If your looking for a good casual place to eat before a show try the French Restaurant Pergola Des Artistes down the block
In and out fast to get to the theater on time
Great service and the food is to die for
This little place is amazing - the price fix is from the whole menu, the food is tasty, the service is fast and for all of this - the price is incredible
Whenever seeing a broadway show, we return to Da Rosina because i'm tired of paying too much for dissapointing food
Da Rosina is a breath of fresh air in midtown and a place worth visiting for anyone seeking good food
Every time my family visits New York, we are always sure to have a few meals at Da Rosina
We are even happy sitting by the kitchen because the food is always delicious and the price is right - $23 three course meal! Where else in the city can you get that good a price? I always enjoy the Veal Picatta, my wife has the Ravioli Roso and my son the chicken Rosina
apps are all delicious, we usually order three with the three course meal and share them
The waiters are always friendly and accomodating, especially Jimmy behind the bar
Here is why you SHOULD NOT GO TO DA ROSINAS
had a reservation--had no reservation list upon arrival
had to wait, door man rude, crazy waiters running around
some sweaty so frazzled, when we returned both an app and entree, the manager didn't even come to speak to us
poor wine selection and coffee was cold
Where to begin
we were seated next to the kitchen, and had to wait for chairs to be brought to the table
Were given wheat bread (WHEAT IN AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT) when we sat down
The calamair app was cold and worse then store bought

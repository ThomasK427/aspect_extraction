Go to 72nd street and head to Burritovill if you want Mexican food
I came here for happy hour and some quick food and I was not disappointed
The drinks were perfect, try the margharitas, and the service was prompt
It is a great place to come with friends
My future brother-in-law, my two teenaged sons and I went in to order take-out
We sat downstairs at the bar area to wait for our order and have a couple Corona's
Harrison Ford and his teenaged daughter walk in and catch the attention of my younger son
I insist he go over and say hello as they are seated
(He has been carrying around a toy figure of a Star Wars character all day and I thought this would be a cool lead-in)
Ford wouldn't even look at him, he never even acknowledged my son, not even a glance or a nod
I know this isn't the restaurant's fault
The food was marginal and my mood was shot for the reat of the day
My son is a great kid and full of respect and loyalty, so from now on I can't watch a Harrison Ford movie without being pissed
Had a horrible experience at Harry's that lasted just over 45 minutes which is how long it took them to muck-up my order and bring it to me
When it arrived it was the furthest thing from what they claim to be 'SF mission style' burritos
They clearly have no clue what those are
The additional $
75 charge for extra salsa from a 2 gallon can topped off the experience
is the only way to describe a recent experience I had at Harry's
Not only did it take them 45 minutes to serve a salad, when we complained, the manager was abusive, told us to get out and literally started clearing the table while we were still eating
The manager even tried to take the plate out from under me while I was still eating! I don't care how cheap the food is, no one deserves treatment like that
Need I say more? 3 ducats for a margharita during happy hour
The only problem is that it is only at the bar, which is small to say the least
The food is ok
a bit overpriced for what you get
it'd be perfect if they brought you some chips and salsa
but that's extra
In my experience, Olympic Flame, a traditional NYC Greek coffee shop, offers good value for one's money in terms of food cost but passable to rude service, depending on who you get
The coffee is poor and an annoying $10 credit card minimum is strictly enforced by sometimes surly staff
The Scene Some nights, it seems as if the entire Upper West Side is at Citrus, a loud and cheerful restaurant with branded tables, longhorn designs on the seat cushions and a tequila selection as long as most wine lists
Downstairs, there's a hopping lounge by the name of Squeeze
The Food The Latin food here alternately hits and misses
Winning appetizers include the robust romaine and pickled-vegetable salad, the selection of quesadillas and the cornmeal-crusted oysters
However, soggy grilled-squid tacos and limp fried shrimp served in a martini glass don't fare as well
Among entrees, the skirt steak and yellowfin tuna stand out
Desserts--including berry-flavored tortillas, a huge flan and a chocolate torte--are surprisingly good
Like everyone else is saying, the tuna salad (rather, the tuna in the salad) was amazing
It was incredibly soft and melted in your mouth
Order it as really rare, not just 'seared'
The pepper corn cooked crust will be just the right thickness
The salad in the salad was chopped, so it lost a bit of its taste and tasted bitter
The shrimp quesadilla wasn't all that good
Bland, very few (small) shrimps
The service was pretty good, though we were there early on a Sunday night, not too many other patrons, though it started getting fuller by the time we left around 8
The bar off to the side was full and lively the entire time, though we didn't try the drinks (the tall margaritas did look impressive and popular)
The hand fed (err, farmed) salmon smelled great across the table, as did the other tuna dish
Don't come to Citrus for a quiet meal
Citrus is a fun place for a crowd of friends or just to people-watch
Great food, wonderful drinks, and great staff make Citrus not only a great neighborhood spot, but also a good spot to meet-up with friends for a strong, well shaken cocktail and a light meal with friends in the UWS
They started us with complimentary chips and homemade salsa
The salsa is good
Second course was sushi (Dragon Roll) for my date, and I had the pepper crusted tuna salad
The dragon roll was artistically prepared and presented and had a nice combination of texture and flavour
It was right up there with some of the best sushi places in the city and well above most places
My tuna salad was top-notch
The tuna was seared to perfection, the pepper did not overpower the salad which was combination of ingredients done in a sesame dressing was a perfect balance for the tuna
In some places the tuna is a lesser quality than they use for the sushi, but not at Citrus
This was very fresh, deep red, sushi quality tuna
These guys know fish and do not scrimp on the quality or freshness of any of their ingredients
Have been here for brunch a few times and love the food each time
Have had pancakes, eggs and french toast - all very good
Service can be spotty but not too bad unless you are in a rush
It was immediately obvious that our server was not interested in the least to wait on our table
It's a shame as we were interested in giving her out business
It seems more often these days the service I receive from Citrus is like that of an Amsterdam (Holland) diner
The visits by the server are few and far between and worse the assistants are left holding the bag and only 20% of the total tip to show
I wish there was more I could say, sushi was small, rolls were unimpressive, and the empty state of my drink left more to be desired
I organized a dinner for 20 and was extremely satisfied with the results
Ambience was classy, well-decorated, great use of lighting; servers were friendly, competent and accomodating
Food was perfect - delicious, well-seasoned, prepared and presented - and great for the price
Everyone enjoyed themselves and I would absolutely return given the opportunity
I went to citris with some friends not knowing what to expect
it turned out to be the coolest, most original restaurant i have ever been to
I got the special rolls on the entree part of the menu (tuna with mango, salmon with banana) although it doesnt sound yummy
i would have it in a second
except for the fact that it is three FULL rolls
18 pcs
which is a little much for me
All of my friends, even Ms
Picky, could find something delicious
I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great food
Also, across the street is a terrific bakery, CRUMBS, which is definately worth trying the cupcakes at
here's a place I've been a dozen times and its good
the steak is hit or miss (I've had really good cuts and some really bad cuts) but the Miso SeaBass is to die for
Its right there with Nobu and sushi samba
The Pineapple maragita rocks (but watch out cause you cant tell your drunk till you stand up)  best margaritas and awesome food what more do i need to say
its a great date spot
but also works well for a party of 8 for a birthday dinner
i would move there for the summer if they'll let me
best margaritas and awesome food
the selection is incredible and their sushi tops nobu if you ask me
enjoy!
outdoor cafe, frozen margaritas, a sushi roll to start, skirt steak to follow, and a chocolate souffle to finish
ok, and maybe a mojito or two
i wish i had one thing to recommend but i would have to write out the entire menu! i am not ashamed to say i eat there everyday
don't miss the yellowfin tuna steak - it's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo gooodddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
Citrus is my and my husband's favorite NYC restaurant! The location is great (check out the Upper West Side!) and the food is wonderful
The warm corn salsa and chips they bring is so tasty and will fill you up!! We love to start with some sushi appetizers
My husband always gets the Marinated Grilled Canadian Natural Skirt Steak, and I get the Wasabi-Edamame Crusted Canadian Salmon
We are stuck on these favorites, as they are delicious every time, but the rest of the menu looks just as fabulous

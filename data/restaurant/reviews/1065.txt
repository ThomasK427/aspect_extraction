both times, however, we were served by a total idiot
this guy forgot to tell us the specials one time, and the other time, it took him like 20 minutes to get us the check -- we were watching him fiddle with the touch screen machine for literally twenty minutes
then i kept getting bumped by waiters as they passed -- i almost lost it
the food is good tho, just watch out for that male waiter
Went to brunch with two of my friends
Everything that was set in front of us - from the white sangria to the entrees, even the coffee - was absolutely delicious
The food is inventive yet comforting, and the service is attentive and friendly
Wish I could find a place like this in Manhattan
We went on Sat for my birtday
Had a fantastic experience!! The food is innovative and exeptional in every way!! Our server was knowledgable and helpful with suggestions and guidance in menu choices (which are extensive)
This place is a gem!! Keep up the good work and high standards!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
I have been waiting for a place like this to open in Williamsburg
It is the best of all three worlds
Food, Service and Ambiance
Everything was excellent
I had the Espresso Rubbed Filet and my wife had the Flounder
We have been talking about it ever since
I highly recommend you check it out, I'll probably be at the table beside you
A friend of mine suggested this place in Williamsburgh and what a suggestion! The restaurant is very cool and hip
There is a great vibe and the food was excellent
My friends and I really enjoyed our brunch there
The food Gods finally answered my prayers
Williamsburg needed a place where Thai food wasn't the answer
My final answer is The Williamsburg Cafe
The food is out of this world
The dining room is by far the coolest thing I've seen
The brunch on the weekends is one huge party for everyone involved
Simply put this place is the Real McCoy
Thank-you God!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In Short An extension of a young coffee chain from Ithaca, NY, this relaxed hangout, decorated with black booths, sleek swivel chairs and colorful artwork, brings the craftsmanship of master roaster John Gant to Brooklyn
All espresso shots are triple ristretto, and daily blends such as Deep Disco and Platinum Blonde come with whimsical descriptions to match--think "Magical Deep Cherry" and "Centennial Harley Leather
"
Why is so much better here? I wish all the coffee shops in the neighborhood made lattes this good
My morning train commute would be so much more pleasant if my fellow travelers enjoyed their morning coffee half as much
Plus they have pastries from Balthazar
What a great way to start the day
After trying the Leftist espresso I am unable to drink coffee anywhere else in the city
They say that you can get anything in NY, well, this was a close one - Gimme! rocks!
When I went, expecting the best coffee in the world, I was disappointed to find an ok but bland cup of joe served by surly hipper than thou type
The space is nice and the prices are moderate, but there are much better cups of coffee to be had in this city
Don't make a trip if it is out of your way
Gimme is by far the best coffee I have ever had
I used to live in Ithaca and after tasting their coffee you literally can't have anything else and be satisfied
They roast their own beans in Ithaca and they will send it to yo anywhere
My father came to visit me at school and tried their mesa de los santos and immediately became a gimme junkie
He now orders online and gets about ten lbs
at a time
So for me to have a gimme cafe in New York is so nice, nothing can possibly compare, so if you cant make it out to williamsburg then just order it online and you will not regret it
Just be prepared to not accept anything less
This is a good bar which also serves food
We went for the food, and were not disappointed, however, the noise level was high, due to the number of bar patrons
It was nice to leave, and is possibly not as noisy on week nights
Anyhow, I had the Jambalaya, and would highly recommend this to anyone
The presenation, quality, and portion made my day
My dining partners had the salad and the BBQ chicken plate
Both were very satisfied
definitely get the side called twice baked potato which was amazing
The theme seems to be southern BBQ to due the type of BBQ sauce on the chicken, and the menu offerings of pulled pork, etc
This restaurant is recommeded for a change of pace in NY city
If anything, go for the kitsch decor!
A great neighborhood place if you're looking for cheap drinks during happy hour ($2
50 bud bottles) or if you're looking to order in
The sandwiches are surprisingly very good and delilvery is quick
Not the sort of place I usually gravite towards but, if you are with some guys and no one wants to break the bank, Earl's is a great weekday, happy hour spot
Went on a Sunday for a decent breakfast
Although we were seated right away, we waited over an hour and a half for our food
Our waitress said she was sorry that the kitchen lost our order and said she put a rush on it
but we still waited another 45 minutes for eggs
Eggs! The food was pretty good when it finally arrived, but judging on the fact that all the other tables around us were also waiting for food, I'd say go when you're not in a rush
I was in the East 30s looking for a low-key, comfortable place to have some dinner with a few friends without breaking the bank
I remembered Earl's Restaurant, and it was exactly what I was looking for
The food was great
good ole comfort food
My favorite was the Spinach Artichoke Dip, best I've had so far in the city
I also got the Buttermilk Chicken, which was soooo good, but I couldn't finish it
Didn't have room for dessert, but they looked good from what I could see from the other tables
Overall, it was a great place to hang out
Tons of TVs, so if there's some sporting event you want to watch, this is the place
And to top it all off, the prices are good!
A BUNCH OF US STOPPED BY EARL'S THE OTHER DAY AND HAD A GREAT TIME
WE CAME BY FOR THE GIANTS GAME AND HAD CHIX WINGS UNTIL WE COULD NOT SEE STRAIGHT, MAYBE IT WAS THE BEER
THIS PLACE IS VERY CHILL, LOVE IT, SEE YA FOR THE NEXT GIANT VICTORY
This restaurant is a joke
Not wanting the rest of the slop made from pure Lard, I opted for the B
A
L
T
= Bacon, Avocado, Lettuce Tomato
Sounds great
When I finally received it, after 30 minutes, it was on a HUGE bun, without any kind of mayo or other spread, with a pound of shreaded lettuce (no leaf?!) and ONE PIECE of NASTY BACON
This one piece was skinnier than my index finger
My 2 other friends ordered this also and had the same problem
We told the waitress, she brought the plates back to add more meat, came back w/ our cold fries and an extra HALF slice of bacon
Whoa
Luckily, the waitress was nice enough to give us a % off the meal, but that will be the last time I EVER step foot in that crap place
AVOID AT ALL COST
Honestly this place rocks, you walk in and feel really comfortable with no pressure other than to be yourself
I did not feel that I had to be cool or trendy at Earl's just hungry and thirsty
The place looks cool and the staff was nice
I had the ribs and chicken combo and a dukearita, what a nice mix

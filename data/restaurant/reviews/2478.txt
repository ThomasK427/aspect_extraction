Long waits --- I've eaten there over a dozen times; had to wait at least half the time; but for less time than it takes to have one drink
The food -- unique and inspired
The service -- exceptionally quick/attentive; tell them to slow down the service if it is 'too good
'   Groups -- excellent job for groups up to 8
If your nose gets bent out of shape for any little thing, the management will make it right
And if it does get bent out of shape, you should have gotten in a cab or a train and chosen a restaurant outside of Times Square
I have a lot of business assocaites and customers who stay in Times Square hotels
I *always* recommend Ruby Foo's to them, and no one says anything but THUMBS UP
I have always been a fan of this restaurant
Have referred a number of people
I took an out-of-town client their last Monday and was totally humiliated
The food--all of it was of very poor quality
I wonder if something has changed! The pad thai was soggy, cold, and tasteless
I asked for it spicy and it arrived with absolutely no sense of heat
I asked for chicken with it and it had 2 small pieces of chicken in the dish
I must say, it will be a long time if at all, before I would choose to go back
this was a great fusion restaurant
the tempura wasabi was the best i had ever eaten and the sushi was really fresh
most of the entree's were very inovative including the wasabi mashed potatoes
the fillet minion was a little too salty and the chicken was average but the side dishes with each meat was amazing
the rices were great and anything with peanuts tasted good
our waiter was extremely friendly but not available to us frequently enough to make more orders for sushi
it's just too bad that after such a great meal, deserts were below average
but all in all, a good restaruant
Great place to go for fresh sushi and a fun environment
Restaurant is very clean and professional and decor is fun to look at- not something often found in a Chinese or Pan-Asian restaurant
Bar area seemed hopping for the UWS
Overall, not a bad gig and a place I could frequent often
All the food is pre prepared including the sushi
This place is like a production line for those who appreciate factory farms and people that come from that type of environment
It felt like Mcdonalds, Wendy's, and Burger King collaborated in a venture to open a new age restaruant for a very dumb audience that appreciates the worst food masked by soy sauce
Good food it is on Broadway so it perfect to go to after a Broadway play
Some Chinese food connoisseurs may judge this place automatically since Ruby Foo's is run by non-Chinese, have a non-comparable menu to most authentic dishes, and be a large touristy spot for people too scared to head out to Chinatown
However, Ruby Foo's wasn't meant to be either of the things
Turns out they create a variety of Asian fusion, which spans from drinks to desserts that are excellent
The prices are not as friendly but they possibly justify for food you don't find often anywhere else
not even your most authentic Chinese restaurant
The wait is long, especially on weekends and nights, and the service is okay but not the greatest
One great thing is the interior -- which a decor that is unmatched and beautiful to look at
Its worth the experience to try at least once
I have been in New York for 3 days and I have eaten here every day
My servers Aaron and James have been extremely accomodating
I really enjoyed the appetizers and can say that I have tried everything on the menu in the appetizer section
The duck spring rolls were excellent
The calamari was so so
I am a big dim sum fan so the dim sum on the menu is not what I am used to but for mass market its good
The tamarind glazed ribs were excellent as were the jumbo shrimp with chow fun noodles (which we substituted for rice), the tuna was scrumptious according to my dining companion
I have been luck to arrive at 5pm for dinner and 1130 and 1pm for lunch and it was not crowded
The only con was having to go downstairs to use the rest room
I walked into a party at Ruby Foos, fully prepared to hate it
I've taken some cooking classes, eaten at 3 stars in Paris, and in general dislike theme type restaurants
However, I had a very good time at Ruby Foos
The service was attentive, and the food was quite good
While I would hesitate to call it Pan Asian (which I reserve for restaurants like Nobu), their sushi wase fresh, and their cooked dishes were prepared with care
The desserts were particulary good, and they obviously put a good deal of time into their preparation - I specifically remember a wonderfully fudgy chocolate cake
And, according to my wife - who knows such things - they can really mix a drink
Ruby Foos, while I wouldn't choose it for an evening of haute cuisine, was a fun place with decent food and I would definitely go again
Reservations don't matter
You'll wait for your table, which will so close to the next table, you'll feel like you're double-dating
The place will be filled with people taking pictures of each other (do they have any idea how obnoxious is?)
The food is okay, and the servers try hard, but fail to be competent (they gave us the same appetizer three times)
There is no way in God's green Earth that I would go there again
I went to Ruby Foo's with a friend, and had a fantastic time! The ambience is great, the food tasty and arrived very quickly, and our waiter was absolutely wonderful
This is a great place to go for a festive dinner with friends!
I love going to Ruby Foos
The food is great - try the Chilean Sea Bass or 7 Flavor Beef
The ambiance is fun with exciting decor
It's great for groups and has a wide menu and drinks selection
I've eaten there repeatedly and never had a bad experience!
Love the B
R
Guest chain, but the food at Ruby's was awful
The fillet mignon entree was charred and all fat, could not even eat most of it
Appetizer arrived cold, draught beer was more than half foam
Staff very/overly friendly, waitress was unengaging
Bill was sizable considering what was ordered
Good atmosphere, but will probably not return
I have been several times
Can be a date, group or family place (kid-friendly)
Service can be really great or average
Atmosphere on most nights is bustling
Usually seated within 15 minutes of reservation time
Have had repeat issues with entrees being brought out before sushi or appetizers
But portions are good for sharing and larger tables have lazy susans in the middle to help with that
I recommend any of the meat and Pad Thai dishes
Try Sakitini and Ruby Foo drinks
Some signature sushi rolls using mango and tempura flakes
if my memory serves me, Sushi rolls #136 and 168 (or 158?) are the best!
We had a great time here with our 2 teenage daughters
The menu is so appealing that we wanted to try everything, and we ended up with twice as much food as we needed, but it was all delicious
Our favorites were the calamari, salad with goat cheese tempura, lemon pepper filet mignon, ginger mashed potatoes, coconut sticky rice, hot and sour shrimp, and the peach crisp
The scallion pancakes were fine, but not as interesting as the other dishes, and the peking duck maki (yes, we probably should have known better
) was odd due to the incongruous taste of the seaweed
I had heard about Ruby Foo's but thought it was a real tourist trap
Wrong
We went to the uptown one and were very pleased with the atmosphere, the service, and especially the food
The short ribs were amazing and the sushi was very fresh
The music, however, was very loud and techno
Don't get caught up in the decor for this restaurant is overpriced and the food is only average
They have so many different kinds of Asian foods, that there is always something for everyone

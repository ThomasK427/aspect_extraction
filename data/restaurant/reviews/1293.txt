The soft shell crab in a pea soup concoction was excellent
The cheese serving was skimpy
They treated me, as a single, very nicely
I would go back
Wonderful service and delicious food
We had to leave early and couldn't do all the course meals, but the restaurant was very, very nice about it and made sure that we got to have a good dining experience nonetheless
On top of superb food, impeccable service from start to finish
A little chilly inside so should bring a jacket or shawl
It may be good to know that they serve prix fixe menus for dinner at the table and a la carte at the bar
Awesome favor, balance and creativity, this is something you will not find in this city
The chef Scott Conant doesnt go after the main stream Italian dishes, nope he goes where most have never tasted
For those of you that are familiar with the writings of Ayn Rand, I would tell you that Mr
Conants new restaurant reminds me of the book the Fountainhead
His motivation for food is his ego, and he practically ignores the ideas of others
After meeting Mr
Conant he beamed of self-confidence that makes his food irresistible
'The self-sufficient, self-confident, the end of ends, the joy of cooking personified
' Conant is a chef who does not follow the typical path to success--he follows his own ideals rather than the rules of his predecessors
He achieves success without compromise
Bravo Mr
Conant Bravo!! Alto is a gleam of culinary delight all must experience
Scott Conant has done it again
I am an huge fan of L'Impero and when I heard that they were opening up another restaurant called Alto I could not imagine how different it could be
Well from the moment you step foot in the door to the 7000 bottles of wine incased in glass, the most comfortable chairs and bankets
I had the tasting menu and have gone back again to have even more
One must try the smoked trout, strangolopreti, squid ink cappuccino, smoked fois gras carpacio, seared seabass, rack of lamb
The overall quality of the food coming out of the kitchen has surpassed any Italian restuaruant I have ever been to
Save room for the ruhbarb strudel and steamed chocolate pudding
My new favorite drink is no longer a Mojito or Cosmo but what they call the Basil Clap
Alto is a cut above the rest
I will not return even if they serve up good pasta
We were left to dine at the bar counter next to women who were loud, drunk and flirting
Fine
but when tables began to clear up, it seemed polite to seat us comfortably in the dining area instead of having us twist our backs to talk, perched on bulky high chairs at the bar with no place to put our handbags (which the waiter happened to drop and expose contents later on)
The first course came 45 minutes after we had ordered, service dragged on longer after that
The manager brushed off my feedback as well, it is a prix fixe
The waiter was knowledgeable about his food, and at least tried to translate the Italian names for truly exotic ingredients
with some snobbery no less, something we did not care for by the end of a tiring and unfulfilling night
i went to ammos last night and was thrilled to find a milos Style restaurant in queens
I found it beautiful and the food was great
definitely reccomend u try this place out
little hard to get to but its worth it
The food is good but overpriced
The service is good
ive been in the industry for over 10 yrs its always great to find a nice litttle place doing their thing and doing it at a high level , service is outstanding and the food was great, must leave room for dessert , great place before a show
i love both 44 X and 44 1/2
and now that the garden is open at 1/2, i'll be going more often
food is great, wait staff is great, but the bartender is slow
Amazing new place on 10th Ave
Reminds me of living in Europe
The food was excellent and the garden area was divine
live right around the corner and go all the time
While there is better Italian in the city, this is an upper east side gem
And best of all it is BYO
I went here last night for dinner with my girlfriend and it was fabulous
Since we are both on a budget the fact we could bring our own wine was key
We started with the anti pasta and then ordered a pasta and a meat, It was so delicious and we both cleared our plates
The waiter was so nice and wasn't rushing us at all to give up our table
If you live on the upper east side you have to try this spot
You will fall in love with the place and it smells like a restaurant straight from Italy
Two thumbs up, We will be back!
I went there for my friend's birthday recently
We started with the antipasta and were amazed at how fresh and delicious the mozarella was! I had the veal and it was wonderful
all in all a great experience and beyond affordable with the BYO! I will definitely be going back, one of the best italian restaraunts on the ues!
This restaurant should in fact be a school to all the others on the Upper East Side
It proves that it can be done
I have been to Italy many times and Grotta is as good as any upscale restaurant in Italy, and don't expect to pay a premium
The food is the best I've had in like 10-12 years on the Upper East Side, portions are generous and the service is friendly and efficient, this place is fantastic! It is in fact very good in every respect
I recommend this place to anyone who values good food/good service
Stumbled across this by accident on opening night and have been going ever since
The food was fabulous
Some of the best Italian I've since I was in Rome
Its BYO, which makes it even better and the check far too good to be true
Delightful back room that is great for larger groups
The black linguni with lobster is fab
A breath of fresh air in the dullness of 2nd Ave upper east side resturants
Went to Grotta this week
It was a great surprise to see what they did to the place
Grotta del Mare is by far, the best and most authentic Italian restaurant on the Upper East side
Its food will draw you back to this place as often as you can afford (it is cheap!!), and I specially like places that dare to be different from the old tired Sphaghetti meatballs + chicken Parm of the so called Italians on the area
Take it from me, I'm a native, if you really want to find out what REAL Italian food is really like, pay a visit to this place
I also have to mention that the service too, is very very good
The only negative would be that they are yet to get their wine license, but I was told that they are working on it
Good place, worth a visit
what a treat, to have this restaurant in greenpoint
the only point of frustration is an ever-changing schedule for when they're open
make sure to call ahead before you go
the duck is great, as are all the fish dishes
the lamb burger is a bit heavy
brunch is heavenly (only served on sundays)
byob indeed does help keep the tab down
enjoy!
We really enjoyed the food although one of our dishes was served a little too close to room temp
I had the lamb chops which were very flavorful
If none of your dishes are served with the Potatos Au Gratin make sure to order a side for the table
My date was wowed by the complimentary flavors of the duck
The backyard outdoor garden seating is nice and the fact that it is BYOB really makes it affordable to enjoy a nice bottle of wine with dinner
I think the biggest complaint I had was the lighting
It was just too dark and the light by the door is overly bright casting huge shadows across the tables
A little attention to detail would really make this outdoor space sing

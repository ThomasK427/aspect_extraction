i discovered this place three months ago and fell in love with it on the spot
the place is a bit hidden, which enhances its beauty, coziness, and cuteness
most of the people speak italian
the coffee and pannini are OH! SO SO GOOD!!! the service is excellent
there is no rush
This is a truly morning/lunch relaxing place
I will continue to angle my walks toward via quadronno all the time
Such a cute place!! The Panini is a must try
The service was courteous and quick
The back room give you a chance to escape the hustle and bustle of NYC with the idea that you are away
It is true that the crowd sometimes consists of very wealthy older men trying to find young women
I have seen that a few times
We never had a bad experience with the service
The pizza is great
The bartender is really funny
The restaurant is a little bit on the loud side though
Good crowd, great pizza, good salad, bad service but fun overall
The pizza is great, the rest is so and so
Prices are ok
Yes, it's a shame
Serafina on 61st St
used to be a nice place
Good food, good ambience; but since a year now, every time I have been there I have always had a bad experience
OK, this is what happens: Serafina is the snobiest restaurant in town, with no reason
Service is really bad, and the hostess are a bunch of huggly snobs who think work at Per Se
The food is inconsistent, and they usually bring you the entree when you are still trying to finish the appetizers, and it's not even to increase turnover, it's just because they don't care
Overall, Serafina is the perfect catch for guys with a little bit of money and hopeless girls trying to find a husband at their late 30s
A pretty disgutsting ambience, bad service, the name being the only asset left
Till when?
This place was horrible
I ordered the rigatoni with bolanaise
It was awful
The pasta was cold and served on a cold plate
Even after I asked for it to be reheated, it was just warm, not hot
The pasta was under cooked
I've made better bolanaise at home
My husband had a pizza and it was also close to being cold
I expected it to very hot coming out of their wood burning brick oven they so advertise, but not in the least
The place was loud and we were seated right next to the bussing area
The clinking of dishes and glasses was just horrible
The wait staff didn't bother to refill my water until I had finish mine and was almost done with my husband's glass too
Horrible
Would never go there again
I don't understand the bad critics to this place
Ok, it is not cheap (but far from being expensive, specially when it comes to dine in NY)
The service was kind and friendly, we had a nice table
The bruschetta wasn't great, but I must say that they have an excellent pizza
Nice pick
bad service is what you get and on top they dont give a dam
$18 for pizza!
go to mediterraneo instead
Who would like to be in the same restaurant of little spoiled dogs sitting on chairs and being fed? Not me! I even asked one of the waiters and he said that small dogs have always been allowed there
I am sorry, that is perhaps why Serafina is not considered a hotplace anymore
The food is good, don't get me wrong, but I am just not going to eat with two or three dogs around me
being treated like people!
Fun casual place, great pizza, so-so service
Have eaten here a few times on weekends, the best thing about it is definitely the European-style pizza
The prosciutto one is definitely my favourite, but the pesto one is good as well
The service is clueless if you're lucky, terrible if you're not
Also, some of the tables for 2 are very close together! But the pizza's worth it, in my opinion, as long as you know what to expect!
We were wandering around in no particular mode or fashion and passed by this place during lunch, decided it looked fairly comfortable for 4 adults and 2 children to eat at
they sat us immediately, the FOOD was WONDERFUL and the service was GREAT
definetly a great find for us!!!
Had a so so meal
pizza was soggy!! Service was terrible
had to ask for the salt pepper and milk to go with tea
Left a tip that way about 12% of bill thought that was good considering service
we were approached by hostess asking if service was ok
not wanting to cause a fuss wee said it was ok
then she procede to tell us that the tips was insufficient that it should be twice tax
sure if service was excellent
we gave more money
Never saw the waiter again and my husband was extremely embarassed as we had family with us from Europe
and the hostess addressed the whole table
We will NEVER go to that restaurant again if it was the last place on earth and you can be sure that we will never recomend it
I've been to the one downtown and to the one on 61st a few times
The menu is identical and so is the way it is prepared
The fresh imported ingredients are quite good
Pizza is good and really Italian style
The pasta dishes are generally good, wine selection is not too vast and not exactly matched to the menu
TheService with few exceptions was terrible, I don't mean that they were rude but totally clueless
When you taste a bottle of wine the waiter is supposed to wait for your reply before pouring it to the rest of the party
Also when ONE person in the party asks for cheese the waiter should refrain from putting it on everybodys plate without asking (exp
if they are having a fish pasta dish)
Try a glass of Berlucchi with the appetizers, better than VeuveCliquot and less expensive
I would rather eat glass than try to get a reservation at this restaurant again
They ask you to fax them and they don't get back to you until that day to tell you if you have it or not
The rude woman who answers the phone won't let you speak to the manager and doesn't know what is going on
A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!!
For a $30 prix fix brunch, the kitchen could not accommodate the request for the one omelette offered on the 3 entree menu to be made with egg whites (claimed there were not enough eggs)
We told them to find the nearest Gristedes and get some
In the end, we had to change our order
For our table of seven, 3 appetizers came out, then three came out 5 minutes later, and then the last one 5 minutes after that
Just plain horrible service
Willow was lovely
We started downstairs with a drink at the teeny bar
Then headed upstairs to dinner
The room was very nice
Old feeling with antiques and candles
A nice different ambiance in a brownstone

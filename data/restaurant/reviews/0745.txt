NOT SO supercalifragilisticexpialodocious
This will be my new fav! The food is fab, the presentation is inventive, and the specialty drinks are out of this world (try the triple berry cosmo-with freshly crushed berries!)
While the portions are a little small
that's just an excuse to try more of the appetizers! Check out the bathrooms but save your butt and forego the tubular bar stools
2 thumbs up Peep, I know I'll be back!
Yeah, it tries a little hard, but this new soho gem serves up some great food
Both the appetizers and the main dishes are excellent
Try the calimari and the duck with rice vericeli
Went there 3 times, always a nice and different experience!  Whatever you're up to this place is really cool, the food is tasty sometimes even surprising, the decor is nice, cocktails and wines are ok and service is really good
Much better than Raoul's (in front of peep)
Not very romantic but nice with your loved one for anew and nice Asian cooking experience The bathrooms are cool make sure you visit! ON
being a fan of the sea restauraunt, i decided to try peer
I was very impressed with the quality and price of the food
This isn't a place to miss for good (no so traditional) thai food
The pink neon, the stools with cross-hatched plastic tubing, it all seems like a lot of effort has been put it to make the place coo, to make bridge and tunnelers ooh and ahh, but the food's damn good, very reasonably priced, and varied
The waitstaff is nice and attentive, and the bathrooms, while also trying very hard to rival bar 89's, are pretty novel
I had lunch at Peep and the food was great! The mirrored ceilings and funky bar stools make it a cool place to hang
I ordered the tamarind snapper fillet and had the peppered spinach dumpling (complimentary) and the banana coconut chocolate streudel dessert
Try it
you'll like it!
The Scene Despite resembling the inside of a giant corrugated box, the dining room is surprisingly bright, warm and inviting
Service is attentive and knowledgeable but not overbearing
The crowd runs the gamut from the hip to couples breaking up to lawyers and their expense accounts
The Food The kitchen sends out American food that is, at its best, lively, fresh and inventive
Start by venturing out to grilled toro with foie gras, then retreat to the comfort of lamb chops with parsnip puree and Brussels sprouts, whose subtle flavorings breathe life into an often tiresome dish
The menu isn't all hits, however
Tuna tartare with cold seared duck breast seems nothing more than an academic exercise, and the oxtail raviolo is sloppy and one-dimensional
Ending with delicious apple pot stickers or hazelnut chocolate cake wrapped in phyllo is a sure way to go home happy
presumptious, overpriced, barbie doll portions, blend taste, the prawns were drenched in soy sauce, really poor service, i do NOT recommend this place
I had to wait 10 mins while they re-arrange the table for our party, and it was a reservation
We returned to Jefferson for the second time for our New Year Eve's celebration
The atmosphere was very festive as the dining room was filled with hundreds of multicolored balloons
The food was exceptional as the last time but a few new pasta dishes were to die for
We plan to return to sample for dishes before the next new year for sure
Having heard of Jefferson for some time, I was excited to eat there
Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed
mostly with the food
My ribeye was full of fat, one of the worst cuts of beef I've ever had in the city
Granted, when I asked for a new meal, they did bring me a new steak, but without an apology
Rather, I got an excuse, Well, it's a ribeye, not a filet
Regardless, my friend's ribeye was twice as thick with a fraction of the fat
My second steak was average at best
Thoroughly disappointing for the price paid
We were at Jefferson to celebrate the holiday season
We were glad to try the $60 six-course tasting menu
Each course was unique and beautifully presented and executed
I was particularly impressed by the leisurely pace that they were served
We never felt rushed even though the restaurant was full
We got to enjoy the food and soak in the amazing ambiance of the place
It was a bargain considering you get a lobster as one of the course
We definitely recommend it highly
Why would a restaurant priding itself on good food and service bring out two dishes at a time for four people with a wait time of at least four minutes between the two
When we finally thought our other two mains were coming out, we were wrong
They brought out two mains for the guys next to us who ordered fifteen minutes after us! The food was adequate at best
After ordering we had to wait twenty minutes for our appetizers
For a $300 tab for four my advice is Go somewhere else!
We had a great meal at Jefferson, we ordered all of the appetizers and they were delicious (although a little small)
And best of all Gitano (sp?) was so incredibly helpful, we loved him, and would come back again just to see him!!! Thank you Jefferson for a yummy meal
We got there early for drinks to see if it was a place we wanted to be and decided to eat there
The hostess gave us the best tabel in the house where we could see all the goings on
we have fabu service and all around experience right down to the last bit of dessert and drop of wine
being in the industry i appreciated being treated the way i treat my guests and the restaurant i run
jefferson is more than a nickel but it's worth it
The food at Jefferson is exquisite
It is rare to find a high-end fusion restaurant that does justice to the subtleties and delicacy of its food
Jefferson does just that
Couple that with a sterile, but appropriate, decor and excellent service and we have a winner
Keep in mind that Jefferson serves food not in fat person/American portions
Expect to leave full, but not stuffed

, Wednesday evening
The West Village
Dinner options are few for two momentarily displaced uptowners
Then, we remember hearing good things about Jefferson, an unlikely oasis of chic on a block co-populated by a pet store and a dance music shop
How glad we are to have done so! The room is beautifully clean, streamlined and symmetrical
Service was well-informed, friendly, but not hovering; and the food was uniformly excellent, from the wonderfully fresh mushroom appetizer, to the perfectly prepared duck and rib eye entree offerings
Cocktails, too, must be singled out as superbly mixed and stylishly presented
This is a Village destination we will most definitely return to
What a great dining experience at Jefferson
every dish we were served was yummy and inventive and just the right size portions
the banana chocolate dessert thing was devine! I also really enjoyed the edamame ravioli appetizer
The space is beautiful, and actually not too loud, which is refreshingly unusual in such a sleek, 'hip' kind of space
A treat, I'll definitely go back!!
We had reservations but because all the members of my party were running late, they bumped us up with absolutely no problem
Service was great
I felt like their entire staff was waiting on us
The restaurant was pricier than I thought it would be but if you're looking for once in a blue moon fine dining with great atmosphere and excellent food/service, you have to go to jeffersons
Must have the scallops for an appetizer and the lobster for dinner
wine was superb as well!
Good food, great service, nice ambience and beautiful people
Remember to dress up before you go! Wearing jeans and T-shirt won't be a good idea
Perfect for first date
The interior is amazing and I feel like I am sitting in the lobby of Hilton Frankfurt
Last evening I had dinner and found the experience overall pretty good
I thought the food was quite good and found the ambiance pleasing
The service could have been better, but that might sort itself out over time
I complaint was the the air conditioning wasn't working very well on a day that was hot as blazes
No explanation or apology was offered for this fact
Overall, however, I'd give it a second look

The place was extremely busy, and with food like this why not
Theyve got a few kinks to work out, but the service was charming, professional and efficient
Went for Brunch on Saturday - had the terrine which looked like someone just mashed tomatoes and goat cheese together, we were put off by the presentation
Our paninis were mediocre at best - could have made them at home! The service was spotty as they were quite busy - we waited a while for everything
overall the entire experience was sloppy and disappointing
All the food was amazing
Great service and suggestions from the waitress
Relaxed and not rushed
Everything was tops
Cute, covered and warm dinning in the back patio
Can't wait to go back for more
The recently opened Paradou branch on 7th Avenue in the South Slope is very nice! Tables are a bit close together but it doesn't feel too crowded
Food is excellent, wine list is a bit short but has a surprisingly broad array of choices
Cassoulet is very good
A welcome addition to this end of the neighborhood
Stumbled on Paradou recently after reading about it in the Village Voice Best Of issue
Its just a really good place
No pretense at all
Really solid food, great, i mean really good wine list and really charming staff
theyve got a great garden that I was told will be heated through the winter
Sipping Bordeaux and eating delicious Entrecote was the perfect way to spend a Wednesday night
Paradou has really set a great environment to relax in a private garden under the stars
Lucky for us, the garden was heated for a chilly September evening
I was so satisfied with the ambiance, food, wine, and lovely waiters that I am going to give Paradou Brooklyn a try next time I'm in Park Slope
Absolutely delicious
I had a great time!
The premise of this restaurant: fine
Small, warm, French, Meatpacking District etc
I was that annoying joiner
The server was not busy, didn't offer me a drink, came by for an appetizer order, never returned for an entree order, so I shared in some of my friend's entrees
The server had been cold and unavailable to my five friends before I'd gotten there
In total, I had the beet salad, a glass of wine, creme brulee, a bite of friend's sandwich and a glass of wine from friend's bottle
The check came and gratuity was added, 20% on the total bill, not the subtotal
The service was a 15%er of the subtotal, at best
It cost me $50 to get out of there without an entree! The whole experience just seemed like a waste of time, especially when you see Pastise across the street
Cute place with back garden, great location
But, is very small, food is very average and over-priced
Nice place for a romantic date if you just stick to wine
The Calamari Basquaise is really outstanding; although served as an appetizer, one could order several satisfying plates as a meal! :) The scallops and the skate are also amazing
And don't forget the crepes afterwards: hazlenut creme and nut
YUMMM! Goes down well with a perfectly served Lillet
these guys rule
what else can you say about a place that springs into action as soon as the lights go out
while every other place was closing down, these guys were packed
they had blackout specials
the owner went and got some bbq grills and they were grilling steaks and lamb chops
he parked his car in front of the place and was kicking out some tasty tunes as well
this place rocks when the lights are on, but they really showed me what theyre all about when the lights went off
when people ask where i was when the lights went out, i was at paradou
Last Saturday, I was walking past Paradou at 2:30am and noticed that the lights were still on! Guess what?! They now serve a late night menu on Fridays and Saturdays until 5:30am
We enjoyed a nice bottle of wine in a cool, lounge-atmosphere with excellent music
Alex, Z French man in charge, recommended we try their new specialty: the sandwich merguezdelicious! Had a great time, highly recommend it
went to paradou for the first time a couple of weeks ago
have been back 3 times since
great food
great wine
great music
super cool staff
a little rought around the edges, but just what the doctor ordered if youre looking for a place that has substance but no pretense, a rarety especially now, in the all too hot meatpacking
Ive been going to Paradou since it opened and have been very pleased to see it evolve from a friendly neighborhood wine bar to an amazing full fledged restaurant
The menu is truly incredible
The new chef has done a great job bringing authentic country French dishes to the menu
The wine list continues to get stronger and stronger while maintaining a great sense of value
The garden has become even more a a treasure since they've renovated it
The owner has told me that they plan on winterizing the garden for all season use
And now theres even a Paradou in Brooklyn
have been going to paradou for over a year now, and it just continues to get better and better
definitely not sitting on its laurels
the new chef, rocks
everything is more consistent
the scallops, ahh the scallops
nothing better than sitting in the garden on a warm evening
one of the great outdoor spaces in NYC
all in all one of the better dining and overall experiences downtown
I was there for my anniversary  dinner on Saturday
The  garden was wonderful
Food was great
It was a  wonderful way to end the day
I had no problems finding parking
I will definitely  be back
We chanced upon Paradou one night around 14 months ago, and keep coming back
It's worth the trip
The food is very good, the wine is great, and the truffles are
incomparable (sorry, Jacques) !
Paradou is a place I feel comfortable enough to go there once a week or more
The food is good, tasty and seasonal, but not too expensive for my friends and I
I love the wine selection, and the staff always recommends great wines to match my taste
Here is a restaurant that is unpretentious, fun and serves up truly good food
I definitely recommend making this your local, wherever you're coming from
I went to Paradou several days ago and had a great experience
The food and atmosphere are fanstastic ~ great music too!
Went to Paradou with friends last Saturday after hearing about it for some time
Really really great
We sat in the amazing garden, which is partially covered and heated
The food was excellent
Non-compromising, authentic and definitely not nouvelle
A great and varied wine list as well
The service was solid, knowledgeablem friendly and not intrusive
They also play some of the best music Ive heard outside of clubs/lounges
I definitely see myslef setting up camp here for the summer

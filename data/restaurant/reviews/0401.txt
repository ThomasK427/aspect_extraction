Grade: D
Atmosphere: that is putting it nicely
We were lucky-- or unlucky-- enough to get the booth right there
The interior is dingy and dirty
It made us want to eat quickly and get out
which, come to think of it, is what they might want
Were we there on an off-day? Well if you'd like a second opinion, my sister agrees with me
I mentioned my Mamoun's experience to her, and it turned out that she and her husband had eaten there on a trip several months earlier-- also while questing for the best falafel
She had the same complaints, but with one additional one: they gave her a can of Coca-Cola that had a layer of dust and something mysterious crawling on it
With that in mind, I'll give the atmosphere/interior a grade of D minus
I'm sure you Mamoun's devotees will prepare the boiling oil for my next trip to NYC, but please look elsewhere in the city for falafel-- keep an open mind
Chickpea's was good (though still nothing special
) The place across the street from Mamoun's-- I don't remember the name-- was MUCH better for everything we ate
Give that one a try-- their falafel sandwich was tasty and much more enjoyable, and the staff was nicer, and wasn't trying to hurry you out
I am really just a person who likes falafel, and went there hoping for the best, but instead I was HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTED
I've tried to be very descriptive with my criticisms here
So let's look at all these grades above
C-, F, D, C-, D, D-
This works out to a GPA (for Grossly Putrid Adventure) of 1
01
Any way you look at it, that's a solid F
Sorry, Mamoun's, but I'm here to tell people that the emperor wears no clothes
(Incidentally, best falafel we've had is at Truly Mediterranean in SF CA)
I tried Mamoun's falafel on my last trip up to NYC, and have been craving them ever since
Best falafels I have ever tasted, and at an amazing price
I am making a special trip on my way to Long Island just so I can get another one
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
Great falafel for $2!!! Not a lot of seating
Great NYC experience
Get the 5 buck special
A $2 falafel, $1 soda, and a $1 baklavah
Leave an extra buck for a tip
You will be satisfied
The stoop across the street is a great place to eat your laf
also washington square park
Each time I am at a club in downtown Manhattan, this seems to be the place of choice amongst the younger generation -- cash only cheap fallafels
Their assortment of Middle Eastern variety is not much, but the fallafels are quite the draw here
The prices were excellent and as was the fallafel
It was harder getting a table in the small cafe than it was standing in line for 20 minutes
Don't worry
that line is worth it
If you're not one of the many veg-heads scoring an EXCELLENT falafel or (my fav) a BabaTabouli platter
please do yourself a flavor * and get the chicken-kebab
I'm not sure what they soak these things in, but they are SO good I'm hoping for a Chicken-Kebabers Anonymous so I can break my addiction one day
They take a little longer though, about 5-10 min so dont grab one if you're in a hurry
Order
Pay
Step to left
Don't forget dessert
please, don't forget dessert
And sure its a bit grimy inside, but all the more charming for it
what a classic
This is a great place to snack late at night, for nothing else but the wonderful sauce on the falafels and the lentil soup, which is probably superior even to their famious falafels
Cheaper than a slice of pizza, and more satisfying too
Just don't bother with dessert
I was walking around and without knowing about this place, stumbled upon a huge line of people raving about falafel
I had never had falafel before, but I'm always willing to trying new things so I got in line and waited my turn
I ordered the same thing the 3 people in front of me ordered (falafel with hummus hot sauce)
Needless to say, for $2
50, I was amazed and realized what the line was about
The sandwitch was great, and I have since been back 2x
Each time is as good as the last, which is great
I'm a big fan of falafel now, but I refuse to eat it anywhere else!
Simply the best middle eastern sandwiches in NY
Always packed day and night
But well worth the short line
great food, fast service, and an experiece! this is a vilage must it has great local and tourist appeal you have to sit on the steeps of the neighbors but ohterwise wonderful!!
I've been frequenting this place for at least 10 years
Without exception, this is one of my favorite places in the city
Sure it's a hole in the wall, but the food is excellent and the price is even better
I agree that Mamoun's has the best falafels, chicken kabobs, and shawarma in NYC, but I think it's a terrible idea to get your food to go
I only live four blocks away, but it tastes 100% better if you eat it there while it's hot and fresh
Who cares if the place is cramped? It's all about the food
I'd go so far as to say that Mamoun's is the best restaurant in New York
The hot sauce is unbelievable
Anyone who thinks different doesn't know good food from bad
My boyfriend and I come into the city from NJ just to eat here! It's so good anytime
Best falafal and chicken kabob
For $2
00, you get a great falafel and in a hurry
The service at Mamoun's is very efficient, and despite the rapid turnover, they do not make mistakes in orders
Even when the line is going out the door, as it often is, you will still get your falafel quickly
They have good kebabs and other food as well
Without question, worth a try and many return visits
I've been going to Mamoun's for over 20 years and it has never let me down
These falafel's serve as the gold standard: lush, well-seasoned, crispy on the outside/fluffy on the inside
and the hummus and baba are top notch
The place is a hole in the wall, but how do you explain lines out the door at 3am
in the winter!?!?!? Simple
it's the quintessential post-Village party sandwich! They serve only 3-4 things on the menu, but they do it well
20 years from now they will still churn out the best falafels for a couple of bucks
This humble hole is exactly the kind of place that makes NYC and the Village great!
I discovered this place without the benefit of recommendation--and really, it is pretty darn good
The tahini sauce is authentic and well done, and the bakhlava is very thoroughly doused in honey and delicious--and best of all, only a dollar
I'm a bit of a foodie and like to think I know my falafels
This stuff, esp
at peak hours when the falafel's going straight from the fryer to your pita, is probably the best deal in NYC
I even like the service--which is fast and stressed (I REALLY hope those guys are well paid) -- but actually very friendly, too
LOVE IT
They don't offer yogurt an essential ingrediant for Falafel

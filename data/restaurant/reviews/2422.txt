I found it to be a very romantic place
Yogurt lamb was fabulous, as well as apricot dessert
Loved the food
Loved the decor
Great place for a quiet dinner on the upper west side
Pasha has excellent service and food and has good ambience and is very good value
Secure a table in the well-decorated lounge area and order off the main menu
The waiters have good recommendations
Pasha is a fave not only of me, but of several Upper West Side friends of mine
I think that although not a bad choice, this place lacks anything special
The lamb pieces were dry (maybe the lamb chop is better) and the fish was fresh but boring and watch out for the bones
At least the calamari was tender, but the main dishes are nothing to get excited about
I would recommend this place to anyone
It was a really nice atmosphere, good service, and delicious food
Not expensive either
Dinner for four with 3 glasses of wine was $150
Good value
We showed up late for our reservation (But we called to say we would be late) and they were really nice and accomodating even though it was crowded
i was not terribly impressed with pasha and having gone to turkuaz prior to, i definitely have to say that turkuaz is better for food, ambience, service and value
pasha is overrated and for the price not a good value
the service is so efficient that i was in and out the door within 20minutes when i went for dinner with a friend, which is almost ridiculous when dining out should be made more enjoyable
to say the least, i do not plan on going back again
As an Armenian, I was hesitant to visit a Turkish restaurant (check your history)
Despite this, I proceeded to this highly-rated destination
I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the service and tastiness of the cuisine
Although the wait staff is slightly less than perfect, they aim to please, and are very accessable
For the food: the appetizers were delicious (you must try the hummus and grape leaves), and the Chicken Kebobs were the most tender and tasty chicken I have had in a long time
simply perfect! The desert was similarly wonderful
I spoke with the manager who is gracious, courteous, and generous
This is a true gem in the West Side of Manhattan
China Fun has begun a avalanche of curiosity
Its food is not only more health conscious, it tastes better than what the normal, run of the mill chinese joint has to offer
Their noodles dont leave that grease residue in your mouth and their veggies and meats are all the more tasty
If there's a better restaurant for fast food I'd like to know about it
Burritoville's burrito's (the only thing I've ever ordered there) are so tasty, fresh, and inexpensive
What are these reviews talking about? I ate here two nights ago
Food good, service good
Hostess was funny and sweet despite a big crowd
Cute too
Good experience overall
Eat here
I thought this place look like a fun spot to grab a bite to eat while visiting the city
I walk in ask to take a look a the menu and was greeted by the a nasty not so passive aggressive hostess
It seemed like it offended her for someone to ask to review the menu - then she acted as if she was busy when I decided to stay
Not for anything but, food can be lousy but SERVICE has to be top rate for me to come back
It was the lowest point of my city visit
Food was average, service was lousy and the atmosphere awful (even for a burrito joint)
I would never eat here again
The hostess manager are rude and the staff is clueless
First, the hostess manager would not seat my boyfriend until I arrived and there were many open tables
He said he'd order while he waited for me, but they refused to seat him
What if someone came in to dine solo? Would they be turned away? Waitress took FOREVER to take our drink order (it was not crowded) and she forgot our chips guac
We had to remind her and she was not apologetic
When the food came it was below average and they got my boyfriend's order wrong
His burrito was served with home fries on the side (WHAT?!?!) and the tortilla was flour when he specifically requested whole wheat
Needless to say, they did not correct their mistakes and barely apologized
That is why we left a $5 tip on a $50 tab :)
A perfect place if you're looking for horrid service, overpriced fare, and 2 hour delivery times
Anything else is better
I ORDERED TAKE OUT ONE NIGHT WHICH DID NOT ARRIVE FOR 1 AND A HALF HOURS
EVERYTIME WE CALLED THE ONLY THING THE WOULD SAY IS THAT IS WAS ON IT'S WAY
NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS COLD
WE WENT TO EAT IN THE RESTAURANT ONE WEEK LATER AND NOT ONLY WAS THE FOOD VERY DISSAPOINTING, BUT THE SERVICE WAS ALSO BAD
THE MANAGER PRACTICALLY STANDS OVER YOUR TABLE UNTIL YOU LEAVE
IT'S A BURRITO PLACE FOR GOODNESS SAKE
After being seated, we waited for 25 minutes before our waiter even showed up at our table
The air conditioning was blowing FREEZING AIR directly on us
I asked politely five times if someone could either turn it down, or move our table
The sixth time, I asked to speak to the manager
The person I was speaking with glared at me and just said, You are
I asked him to turn the air conditioning down, and he became beligerent, and continued staring at me like some school-yard bully! I eat out all the time and I can honestly say that this was the worst I have EVER been treated
After that, I was verbally harassed with curses from another member of the staff! Then, I walked out and I will never go back
This place is the worst restaurant I have ever been to
The manager and his little lacky that works up front are rude, and really seemed very angry
The food is absolutely horrible
Not a good place for dates
The staff acts like your sitting in Nobu! Come on guys, you run a sub-standard burrito joint! You'd think they could that right! Do yourself a favor and STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!
As soon as our waitress arrived at our table she stated that their delivery truck had not arrived and they had no chicken, tomatoes, chipotle or mole sauces
Right off the bat she had no personality was very rude
In the hour we waited for our food we had to remind our mentally challenged waitress 3times to bring our chipssalsa
But the tables around us were all getting their chipssalsa drinks refills
When lunch finally arrived we had been there for 1hour15minutes
Starving at this point, I realized my order was wrong
Our waitress said she got confused - SHOCKER! I sent my meal back and told her to forget it
Will never go back to Harry's! Do yourselves a favor and KEEP WALKING
Completely inept staff, horrible service, this place will sour your mood for the rest of the day - avoid it at all costs
The staff at Harry's would be much happier, I'm convinced, if it didn't have to put up with any customers
They were rude from the time we walked in the door (literally, the hostess became upset with us because we apparently didn't get through the door fast enough and were blocking others from entering
there were no others)
Then the waitress became upset when she returned with the drinks and we didn't stop our conversations quick enough to remind her who had ordered what only 5 minutes prior
Only two snapshots of an entire evening of being made to feel like Harry really didn't need our business
So
it was the first and last time he'll get it
The food is really great but the service is absolutely horrible! Every time I have ordered from Harry's they have forgotten the guacomole- EVERY TIME! And every time I called to tell them they gave me some crazy story
He must have dropped it on the way and a slew of others
They charged me for the guacamole every time
And the worst part is that they offered 2 free lunches for my trouble and when I called to redeem them, they told me they had no idea what I was talking about! Harry's get your act together!
The food has always been good, and along with the great happy hour specials, it's a great place to go
I used to come here every so often, but my last time there was my last time
The food is decent, but for what the bill comes to, it's just not worth it

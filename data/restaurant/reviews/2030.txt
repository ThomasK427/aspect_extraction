blows their cupcakes away
The icing at Magnolia is wayyyy to sweet- like eating pure sugar
Cute little place, nice staff
What can i say i only order the German Chocolate Cake
i am addicted!
Deeelish cupcakes
My fav is the yellow cake with chocolate frosting, i bought 1 dozen and 1/2 for some friends and myself
Love how they have a taste of corn muffin mix with a hint of sour cream
Can't imagine the complaints of the people who work there, they were very nice and helpful even over the phone!!
I love the Red Velvet cake, but I truly favor their Vanilla cupcakes with Chocolate icing
Yummmmm!
There is no finer cupcake to be found
Just passing by you can smell the calories of pure butter and sugar in the swirling in the air around you
One bite of any flavor is sure to please even the most discriminating diner
My girlfriend and I went here last weekend
It's quite a cute place, and the people are super friendly and cool
But christ, what's with the long lines? They're not THAT good
Just like the cupcakes I used to make from Betty Crocker
Save your money folks and invest in a tin pan and some cake mix
I went recently on a weekday during my lunch hour
I was the only customer and there were 3 workers just standing behind the counter
After I chose my cupcake and went to the register, not one of them took the 3 steps required to stand in front of the register to take my money
After standing at the register for at least half a minute, I finally had to ASK, Can I pay for this now? The person who finally took my money acted like she was doing me a big favor
The cupcakes are good, but are somewhat reminiscent of Devil Dogs
I had heard about this place and their to die for cupcakes
Be prepared
this is the sweetest sweet you're ever going to taste
They are very good, but overpowering with their rich sugary tastes
I say a once in a lifetime thing, my friends crave them regularly! For kicks, eat them in the nearby park with what have to be the fattest pigeons on Earth (I think I know how they got that way
cupcake wrappers litter the ground)
The cupcakes and the layer cakes are reasons enough to brave the lines that snake out the door and down the block
Perfectly moist cake interiors with rich frosting on top! Particularly the vanilla flavored cupcakes and the sinfully delicious red velvet cake
Wished they had a side cafe area to sit and eat the treats with coffee other than the two dinky tables that are in there
I guess the staff has to be curt with the sheer number of customers that stream in
For those who can go in the middle of the day on a weekday, they're much nicer
The cupcakes are incredible! I couldnt resist - ended up buying a box full! The icing is just right, the cake is moist and tasty, and they are decorated beautifully
It was a great experience! The place can get a little crowded, but after going to some mediocre bakeries in the past, this one is well worth the trip! Try it out!! Its delicious!
The cupcakes, of course! Banana pudding is great too
but don't expect service with a smile
The crowds are fun too
On the recommendation of a friend, I bought both the Magnolia and Buttercup baking books
The recipes are easy to follow, and everything ends up looking great
But, the cakes I made ended up being a little dry, so when I paid a visit to Magnolia earlier this week and I was eager to try the cake
The cake slices at the bakery are dry as well
However, the cupcakes are better, and the banana pudding is to die for!
I absolutely love Magnolia Bakery
Their cupcakes are the best I have ever had in my life
and everyone I bring there agrees
They are very sweet and buttery though, so you need to have a sweet tooth
MMMMMM
I went after dinner with a few friends who had to try the cupcakes
Big disappointment
The cupcakes were melted, messy and nothing special
The staff was generally unhelpful and the crowd acted like sugar addicts looking for a fix
Not worth the trip
i've heard so much about the magnolia bakery from friends and from watching sex and the city that i made a special trip the first moment i arrived in the city
i love the vanilla cupcakes the best
the frosting was so plentiful and so creamy
the chocolate cupcakes were okay but not as yummy as the vanilla ones
the cupcakes are as yummy as they are cute
The Magnolia Bakery has the best cake on earth! My favorite is the Hummingbird Cake, but I don't think I ever met a cake there I didn't like!
I love Magnolia's cupcakes
I always have too many at once and feel nauseous afterwards, but it's worth it
Plus, they're just so pretty to look at
Yummy, yummy
this little joint is as good as it gets
You gotta try it
BEST PLACE TO SATISFY THA SWEET TOOTH IN NEW YORK
THE CUPCAKES DON'T MAKE IT HOME
I DON'T SUGGEST BUYING A WHOLE CAKE SINCE IT DOESN'T TASTE AS GOOD A FEW DAYS LATER
Taking my mom and pop to Magnolias for the first time threw me into debt! Why? They fell in love with the best treats and desserts you could ever have
For over month they told other family members to go and check out there delicious desserts
The cupcakes; of course being my absolute favorite out of the whole place is what makes going to stand in line for over 15-20 min well worth the wait
Thanks Magnolias for catching the eyes of so many new people!
The desserts at Magnolia Bakery are delicious
Especially their famous cupcakes
My only complaint would be is that the place is a little small
It can get very crowded
I guess no one bakes any more, because if they did this place wouldn't have nearly as many rave reviews
The cakes are outrageously priced for what they are- you could easily get a cake recipe and whip one up yourself that would be a lot better
Same goes for the cupcakes
I'm not cheap, I'm just not impressed by something I could do better myself in 30 minutes
A friend got some kind of bar that was too gooey and sweet
The staff was brusque, it was like a sauna inside and I saw too many flies for my liking
My advice is go pick yourself up a cookbook and stop at the supermarket instead of Magnolia- when you see how easy it is to whip this stuff up yourself you'll ask why you ever paid those prices for someone else to do it
Can't quite figure out what all the hype is about
Cupcakes seem to be from a mix
People piled on top of one another and the desserts
Self-service so everyone is handling your cupcake before you get to eat
I love this place----those cupcakes are just LETHAL! Do not come within a two block radius of this place if you are watching your weight! You are fighting a battle you can't win
I see whythis place is always packed
All birthday cakes should come from Magnolia or Buttercup
This is a happy, happy world
The staff here could be a little more on the ball but can't complain too much
Best coconut cake ever!
so good that I had to purchase the cookbook
I cannot wait to recapture the feeling
I have gone here with friends on the way back from various restaurants,but am still waiting to be impressed by anything I have had,none of it is bad but it is basically just a mediocre bakery with a lot of hype
I am assuming that most of the people who rave about their goods-dont bake for themselves or at least have never tasted great home made goods
So all in all lets remember its a bakery it really cant be bad but if you see a kid selling homemade cupcakes on the street they will be a heck of a lot better than the ones here,and that goes two fold for their magic cookie bars

Go - it's perfect
You'll notice that most of the reviews rave about the wines, but the amazing thing is that the food actually deserves equal billing! Terrific flavors and generous portions (even the foie gras app was a good size)
Highlights included the scallops in thai red curry nage, a simply amazing lobster salad, succulent short ribs, and terrific lamb and duck entrees as well
Only the cod entree seemed lackluster (although its lobster broth was tasty)
For dessert, the standout was the financier with cherries, and the runner up was the vanilla entry in the trio of creme brulees
The only negative was that our waitress was a bit on the dour side, but the food and wine more than made up for that
You get 3 courses for $68
I had cripy sweetbread as the starter
It's a little over fried
Not bad but Blackbird (Chicago) does it better
Red snapper was well done: tender and juicy
Short ribs was fork-tender: intense and satisfying
They don't have petite four, but a wonderful light custard in a shot glass that came after the main course
It was so good that it really built up my expectation for the dessert to come
Unfortunately, that was the disappointment
The fig chocolate box was dry, uninteresting, and just didn't taste good
It tasted like something that's been sitting behind the glass the whole day in a chain bakery
The accompany ice cream was also just
blah
Not much flavor
The saverin was good, but again, had it better
Veritas is an examplar of informal refinement - no airs, no pretension, simply the mutual understanding between guests and staff that it is a place for oenophiles to enjoy an appropriately nice meal with their great bottles: on offer: the fine-dining standards: fois gras, sweetbreads, steak, saddle of lamb: light but classically-influenced, balanced-flavored, deftly-prepared, unchallenging food
If the high cost is a concern, it is best not to go
If you're going, you will certainly have the opportunity to enjoy some tremendous bottles and relax
Veritas lacks utterly the stuffiness of say a Daniel or Picholine
Also, the sommelier is extremely accomodating and helpful
Call ahead to discuss your wines and decant, if appropriate, before your arrival
Enjoy!
The food and atmosphere are superb here
However, while my date and I both know something about wine, the list here is large, intimidating and very pricey
Make sure to take a look online before booking reservations
What can I say? Tasty food, longest wine list I have every seen (comes in a heavy binder), very friendly and helpful staff
I've been back several times in the last year
We went for an early Sunday evening dinner recently
The service was excellent
The wine is spectacular, with all staff extremely helpful and knowledgable
The restaurant was somewhat smaller than we expected, yet it was warm and inviting - not at all stuffy
The lamb and veal recieve high recommendations
Highest recommendations to the wine (worth a second mention) and the tasting of creme brulee
The entire experience was wonderful
The food was excellent and service was very good
The best part - while we know our wine - the sommelier helped pair our meal with an excellent lesser known $80 French Rhone
There is no 4x wine mark up here - wine list is amazing and quite reasonable
Only advice - sommelier is an expert and listen to suggestions offered
Dinner at Veritas was one of the best meals I have ever had
Scott Bryan is a genius
The food was spectacular, as was the service
The sommelier was incredibly helpful without a touch of snobbiness


and the wine he recommended was perfect
Expensive, but worth every penny
Highly recommend the foie gras, asparagus with mushrooms, and the braised veal
Everything from the time we stepped foot into Veritas was exquisite
Flatiron building creates an elegant and welcoming atmosphere
The gracious and attentive wait staff are knowledegable and not at all overbearing or condescending
The food was wonderful - delightfully tasty and imaginative appetiziers and entrees
Highly recommend: hamachi tartare appetizer, lamb and monkfish entrees and the chocolate souffle (aptly described as an oozing choc cake!)
I couldnt believe it
This was the best pizza i've tasted in 25 years
I bring their pies every where i go just to watch the expressions of friends and colleagues
A great little place, family owned with a family atmosphere
Good slices especially the Sicilian, rice balls, and if they got stuffed clams there the best
I grew up on their pizza slices and crave them every time I'm in the east village
This place is much better than the other slice joints and the family atmosphere hasn't (yet) succumbed to the neighborhood gentrification
A solid choice
My friends and I walk to 5 Roses, even though it is pretty far away
Why? Because it is the best pizza in the city
Made by a cute Polish woman, the pizza's crust is amazing
It is cripsy and delicious
Try and get it when it is fresh out of the oven!
A small place with a moderate menu but every item great
Your basic slice has so much flavor in it that you really don't have to add to it
The cheese is to die for
It was one of the best tasting slices i've had in a long time
if you have not tried it yet, give it a shot and i'm sure you will make it your regular pizaa place!  Not to mention all the celebs that go there because of its low key atmosphere
Go get a gegular slice and let the cravings begin!!
the pizza is always piping hot, the crust always thin and the sauce always bursting with taste
the service isn't so bad and you might have to wait in a mini line on a friday night after drinking, but what's a little wait when you can eat a darn good pizza?
For 4$ you can't get much better
The pizza is a just bit better than average, but the price is what makes Pizza Mercato a weekly treat
Take out is better because the seating is just awful unless you like college students, but I'm always satisfied when I leave
The pizza here is average
For the price, the food is pretty decent, and I certainly have no complaints
In general, however, there are better places to get a slice of pizza
Compared with some of the other places that serve pizza by the slice, Mercato gives the impression that it's pizza has been sitting out for a little bit longer
No serious grievances with this place, and if you are in the area, stop by and try a slice
Some people really enjoy it, so judge for yourself
Pizza Mercato serves passable pizza for cheap
You can get the 2-slice+a drink deal, but beware, the drink is tiny
The sandwiches are okay, and service is fast, but for my money, I'd rather walk across the park for The Pizzeria on MacDougal (halfway to Bleeker St
) They don't have the starving-student deal, but the slices are still cheap, and the pizza is just better
Mercato's is okay, but if you're doing the shopping stroll down Broadway, do yourself a favor and head for The Pizzeria
More seating there, less of a college-student crush at peak times, too
Used to go here a lot when i went to NYU, and i miss it terribly
Best pizza in New York, as far as i'm concerned
It's got a really good fluffy but flat yeasty crust that makes you want to scarf down way more pizza than you really need to be eating
They also have a great deal of 2 cheese slices and a drink for $3
Beat that
And as the sign in the window proudly proclaims, they make pizza the way its served at the Italian embassy

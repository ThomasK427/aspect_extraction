You've got everything - pork, beef, chicken, sausage, lamb, etc
They've also got a huge salad/sushi/appetizer bar that you won't even get to if you're eating the meat
The meats are amazing and never ending choices! Great buffet bar
I do not recommend this place to be good for a romantic dinner because the waiters and waitresses are so hot, you can't take your eyes off of them
When your there ask for Raphael and you will understand!
My girlfriend and I are big fans of Plataforma's midtown location, and thought we'd give their new site a try
The atmosphere downtown is sleeker, quieter, more relaxed
good for one-on-one conversation with a friend or date
Unfortunately, the salad bar is smaller than the one midtown, and the meat servers don't seem to visit your table as frequently
I suspect that, with less traffic than the midtown location, the Broadway spot needs to watch its profit margins more closely and can't afford to give away food
Bottom line? Tribeca offers the more relaxing experience, midtown the more stomach satisfying one
WE WENT THERE WITH MY COWORKERS (2 OF THEM FROM BRAZIL) AND WE HAD THE BEST TIME
THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AND THE DRINKS
OH, MY GOD!!!! TIP: DON'T GET TOO STUFFED AT THE BEGINNING, THE BEST COMES AT THE END
If you like steak, this is the place to be
Service is more than what you can expected
Been there so many time and not a single disappointment :-)
I went to Ciao on a Saturday evening and the food was not up to the price asked for
Additionally, the service was terrible
Had to look for a waiter for everything, would serve drinks with no glasses, would act put off when we requested them
Very overpriced, would never go there again
I walked away feeling taken, after the five of us ate here for dinner last night
The food was lame at best
Average portions, average to below taste, stale cheese, cold bad forcaccia bread, just wasn't impressed with the food at all
On top of that, it was way overpriced (a craft of wine was close to $40
00
)for what we got
I was surprised
Additionally, the service was unattentive, we were crammed on a small table, it was hot and too loud
Overall a bad experience
I will never go back here
I used like this place for many year, but yesterday was extremely disappointed
The service was terrible, and I had chase after the lazy waiter for simple things like forks and knives
The food was mediocre
But what destroyed any good feeling was when it was time to pay, the bill was overpriced and none of the items that the manager and I agreed on a few days ago, were being honored
The manager disappeared conveniently (to get something to eat from a different restaurant was the excuse given)
When he finally showed up, he pretended not to speak English and we had to negotiate again, with a major loss for me
I was extremely disappointed, and will never return to this place
There are plenty of nice restaurants around who do a better job in servicing; therefore I rather support them in their efforts
Too bad for Ciao!
First, the wine we ordered tasted horrible
Then two of us ordered pizza and the pizza tasted like it had been brought from a supermarket's freezer
Then, our waiter NEVER came by to check on us to see how we were doing
Thus, we decided for once not leave a tip
The waiter then confronted us and basically wanted to know why there was not a tip
We told him our complaints and then he basically stated that we had ordered a cheap wine, so what did we expect
So, if what I order costs under $70 I should expect it to be bad? Then he proceeded to call us cheap! Yes, he called us cheap
Now, I could see where he would be upset if maybe he had done his job and tried to make amends for the bad wine pizza, but he had done NONE of these things
THe food is ok
good service though,, the brunch menu offers great value for the location
a good place to be when the weather is nice
I was in Greenwhich Village last Saturday night and stumbled upon Ciao which proved to be the worst restaurant i have been to in NYC
We had literally NO service and the manager spent the whole time on his cell phone
There was no waiter for our table, we weren't given water, cutlery
We ordered simple - tomato, mozzarella and avocado salad which was horrific - no flavour, unripe tomatos, rubbery cheese
In addition we were not given olive oil, salt or pepper and when we complained we were told we were difficult customers
My pizza was doughy and clearly not cooked - i ate one bite and complained only to be told that i would have to understand because they were busy! Since when was busy an excuse for terrible food? I would not only NOT recommend this restaurant but highly avoid ever going near it!
All I ordered was iced cappacino and dessert
The dessert never came and the iced cappacino was warm
Let e repeat myself: my ICED cappacino was warm
And they still insisted I pay for it before I leave
Girlfriend went on a nice sunny day to enjoy some coffee and dessert while sitting at the outside tables
We place order (2 coffees and dessert) and wait
15 minutes later, no dessert yet
We ask waiter and he rudely says we're out!
I ask for manager
He comes out and says, we don't serve just coffee and dessert outside
You didn't spend a lot, so why are you complaining? Great
it's always nice to treat your customers like 2nd rate citizens
Went at 3 p
m
last Tuesday for a late lunch with a friend
After waiting for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order
After re-ordering, we waited another 45 minutes to no avail
I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter
We finally walked out hungry after having waited almost two hours
Horrible experience - stay away! I can't imagine how much worse it would have been if we'd gone at a prime time!
A couple of us dined at Ciao on Saturday night
The place is pretty nice
although you could feel the draft of the wind from outside as you sat
We ordered Bruschetta Pauline which was OK
and also ordered Gnocchi
It was AWESOME
The best I've ever tasted aside from my own :o) I would definitely go back!
I brought my girlfriend to Ciao for a Valentine's dinner, had a reservation there
Waiter forgot about bread and water and we had to ask for it
After ordering - the waiter continued to be rude and distracted - we waited about an hour for our food
After informing them that we had been waiting for so long, they kept telling us that it would be coming, it would be coming
Finally, we got fed up and left, and not even an apology from the Maitre D' or the waiter, who just looked upset that they were losing the money
I will never go back there again
The service was terrible
Lived in New York for several years and haven't experienced service this bad
I love this place! The food is fresh and they have a great mango margarita
I live in the neighborhood and this is my favorite place
A+++
I think this is a great place! The food is excellent and they have a beutiful wine selection! I took my girlfriend here and she loved it! The music it's great
This place does have a small menu, but the wine list is good and they use some of the freshest ingredients I have ever tasted
Inside is bright and welcoming
A great find
Ciao is a charming restaurant

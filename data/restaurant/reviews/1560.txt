The waiter we had, Jamie, was a TOTAL kick
Very nice, funny guy and a good server
Oh, yeah! The meal was very good, too!
The evening started out great
We had a wonderful dinner
great steaks side dishes
The oysters clams on the half self were terrific too
However, after dinner was finished, we were rushed through our coffee and desert
my coffee was even taken away before I was finished
For the price of the meal, the least they should do is let you enjoy the coffee!! THEY ALL BUT ASKED US TO LEAVE!
We were also very disappointed that the cigar bar is closed although it is clearly advertised on the front window
Just ate at this location last Thursday and had a great time
The place was packed but we were able to get drinks at the bar w/out a problem despite the crowd
Once seated the service was prompt and efficient w/out being intrusive
I had rack of lamb and it was great
Cooked just right and the portion was perfect
Had several bites of my friend's steak and was very impressed
It's too bad the night had to end on a bad note; when we went to have cigars in the cigar bar at the back we were told that although they continue to sell cigars it's now prohibited to smoke them! Yes, even in the enclosed Cigar Bar in the back
I am a fan of AM
I have been going there for years
Even though it is loud and always crowded, the food makes up for it
The steak is nowhere near the best in Manhattan but the veal, chicken and fish is unbelievable
The side dishes are also excellent
The salads are more than filling and their blue cheese dressing is great too
I would recommend making a reservation before you go, even though you will still have to wait for a bit
I tried this restaurant for my husband's birthday
I should have stayed away when they managed toscrew up my reservation twice -but I didn't
We were a party of nine and were made to feel as if we were lucky to get a table when we wanted it-as they screwed up
We were rushed, the food was OK and we were stuffed into the most crowded room in the house
The food was way too expensive and it really was not that impressive
Stay away from here
Really
I went to AM for the first time about 3 yrs ago and had the best steak I've ever had
Been to numerous other steakhouses and can still say AM is the best
I've been back there numerous times and have never been disappointed
They also have great side dishes
Been here many times, reviewing it now
Went last night, had an 8:30 reservation, got there an hour early and despite the horde of people waiting for tables, we were seated immediately
Everything was great
Sides were tasty, and up to par with all the competition
I had the blackened Rib-Eye
It was EXCELLENT
I have had it at SW's before, and this one blows theirs away
Juicy, huge, spicy and full of flavor
Tried my friend porterhouse
Very good, but there is no better porterhouse on this planet than that of Frankie Johnnies in Hoboken
Been to AM's several times and have never been disappointed
Go with a crowd and order the seafood sampler appetizer
The blackened rib-eye is unbelievable and the teriyaki filet is tasty
The noise level and lively crowd creates a more festive atmosphere than the typical steakhouse of darkwood decor
Everything is big here
even the cocktails
Go with friends and enjoy
Great steakhouse with an upbeat, art deco feel
Go with a crowd and enjoy
Try the filet and get the garlic mashed potatoes
Cigar bar is great for after dinner drinks
best steakhouse for your $$$
Don't bother if you're an old geyser, you won't like it
The decor was absolutely alluring, and the throng of people waiting for a table convinced us to give it a try
Worst mistake of our lives
The gristle they serve as steak made me feel as though vegans might have a point, and my friends chops looked like they had been plucked from a dead pigeon in the alley (but we know this could not have been the case because even pigeons have flavor)
Over priced, full of smoke, and feces on fancy plates sums this pig sty up for me
This place is so consistently good that i find myself going here more frequently all the time
The lunch special is a great deal
The steaks are excellent--especially the blackened ribeye--and the creamed spinach is equal to the task
what else do you need from a steakhouse
i've never had a bad meal at this place whether it's the chicken, fish, or steaks
Been here a few times, and all of them have been very pleasant experiences
The wait staff is reasonably helpful, though they did pull a switcheroo on me with the wine
Could have been my mistake, but I doubt it
Go with an appetite as the food is great
It does get crowded with plenty of blue shirted cigar smoking wannabes, so make a reservation
We went on a Sunday night and had a 7:00 reservation
We had about a 20 minute wait at the bar which was fine with me
It gave me enough time for two cold beers
I was a little disappointed that they were out of prime rib, but settled for the 26 oz rib steak which I shared with my 10 year old
The steak was **awesome**
My wife had the rack of lamb which was equally amazing
My 12 year old daughter had the hamburger which was clearly the best value on the menu
The burger was huge and tasty
She is a very picky and slow eater
The burger was devoured in no time
We ordered two large sides for the four of us, and it was more than enough
Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this place
Ignore the naysayers
Maxie and Angelo's is a winner!
I ate here one night with a girlfriend, and it was wonderful! We split the filet, appetizer of calamari (which was enough to have as an entree), and the chocolate souffle
Everything was soooo delicious
We went around 9:00 so the atmosphere was perfect, and the waiter was a sweetheart
Definately will go again!
This place is a waste of time
Had a reservation for 2 at 8 and didn't get seated until 9:30
I won't even wait for an hour and a half when I don't have reservations, but the hostess and the pompous maitre d' just jerked me around and kept on promising me that I'd be the next to be seated
And then the final time I asked, the maitre d' told me that he thought I'd already been seated
There are too many great steak places in NYC to waste your time with this one
I've only been to the park av 19 st location
Yes the bar is loud, but I'm talking Diner
For around $20 bucks you get a very good steak
Martin's are top notch, and for the girls, try the chocolate with the glass dipped in white chocolate

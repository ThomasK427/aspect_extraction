My wife loves the baby back ribs and Jumbo Shrimp combo
I use to live in the Bronx and would go to Sammy's almost every week
Now I live in Florida and miss it so much, When I visit my family in NY I always insist they take me to Sammy's the best restauarnt in NY
This is the best seafood experience I've ever had! Generous portions and quality food is what will bring me back to Sammy's again! You must try the bbq'd beef ribs as an appetizer, they are fork-tender, fallin off the bone good! Fresh Alaskan crab and lobster completed a terrific meal

my boyfriend and i decided to go out for dinner late on a sat night
we wanted sea food, but FRESH seafood
no red lobster over here
not that night anyway
lol
i've always wanted 2 go 2 city island, so off we went
i picked a restaurant out just from driving around and i couldn't of picked a better one
sammy's fish box had great food, great service, great drinks and was over all pleasure to eat @
the food was fresh and plentiful
i am with out a doubt going back
on a scale of 1-10, i would give it a 9
I have lived on City Island where Sammy's is located but until recentlly, never tried it
I was astonished by the food
It was so good
I started with the best New England chowder I ever had and finished with a Giant piece of Key Lime pie also great
If you can believe it the in between was ever better
Great fried Shrimp and the Steak surf Turf I had were mouth watering
I highly recommend this restaurant for me it was the best seafood dinner I can ever remember eating
I visited Sammy's for the first time last Saturady night on a recommendation of my girlfriend
I was astonished how beautiful and romantic the restuarant was
We started with fantastic apple martini's and then proceeded to split a 4 lbs stuffed lobster that was the best I ever had
The meal came with so many extra at no cost its was amazing
I can't wait to go back next week and try some of the other items
I am originally from San Francisco where great seafood is king
But I have to admitt that Sammy's fishbox on City Island was absolutely the best King Crab I have ever eaten
My party of 8 had a seafood feast sampling Sammy's menu and we couldn't believe how great the food was
After leaving the restauarnt I called my mother in San Francisco who runs our family restauarnt and told her I just had the world best Seafood
I salute Sammy's fishbox
great food good amount and nice ambiance  I enjoy going here i think the food is wonderful and they accomidate your needs
the serving portions are your moneys worth so take the family out and in joy  I also has valet parking free of charge!!!!!
I've been to Sammy's a few times and the food is always marvelous
I highly recommend Sammy's to anyone who wants great seafood especially lobster and can't get to Maine
This place specialized to food coloring and excessive breading on everything
I was looking for sea food, but only found bread crumbs
I have be there couple of times already taking my wife and friends and always did well there
Its always hit with the food and vallet parking is good
The crowd is mix, but never loud
Had dinner there on a Saturday night and the decor is beautiful
Problem we ran into was the section we were in was very warm and uncomfortable
Our server was peppy and attentive
The broiled seafood combo and the Red Snapper we ordered was superbly done
Since the sides come in separate bowls, we were able to share
The middle section had a band playing
Since we were in another section, it didn't drown out the conversation
Pass by all those touristy seafood places that are packed on City Island
Go where the locals go -- to The Black Whale! If you want a less expensive meal, go to the City Isalnd Diner
If you want a fancier place, go to Le Refuge
But if you want good food at a relaxed local spot, the Black Whale can't be beat! The outside dining area out back is perfect during the hot summer
And they have movie nights, too! Go there!
OK, this place is decent and I stress decent for take-out
Better than average Italian take-out places but don't eat at the restaurant
the waitresses are all airheads and the management doesn't care if you complain
The lounge charges $15 for a Martini and they're not even made right
The best thing is the dipping oil for the bread which is divine
There are much better in the area
I've been going to Louis Seafood for over 5 years
I had my daughters baptism there
The food is great, but because of my recent experiences, I could not in good conscious, recommend it
I find them not to be too friendly
Their staff, including the owners (family members) and hired staff, does not seem to smile at you when you are dining there
In fact, just the opposite, they seem to stare at you
Not a good thing to do to your customers
Anyways, we found a new restaurant to go to
Louis Seafood, thanks for the many years of dining, but I will no longer dine at your restaurant
Hopefully, you will take this rating and learn from it
Be friendly to your customers or soon you will get more former loyal customers to follow suit
Though the name may be a bit misleading, this restaurant has the best Pizza in the Bornx
(only negative is that they don't sell by the slice-have to buy a whole pie)
Good for families, good for going with friends and a nice room in the back for parties
Very pleasant atmosphere and service
Casey's Bar and Restaurant has the best burgers in all of NYC
The quality of the meat is unsurpassed and the combinations of flavors in any of their 15 specialty burgers is abolutely amazing
Wednesdays are Burger Madness nights with extra signature burgers added to the menu for the one night only
Casey's also has full bar service with the best and friendliest bar staff in NYC
Prices are very reasonable and everything is well worht it
The best chicken and Broccoli, wontons are made to order!!! Very good food, and very generous portions as well!!
If you head for Tommy's, try the pan pizza, it's like a round, mini-Sicilian pie, and tastes awesome
Great food, better service!! Try the Fiore de Mare in appetizers if you are a shrimp fan! Also, great ambiance!
Delicious entrees
Amazing dessert and cappucino presentations
Good Quality food where they treat you like family
Great pies
Some of the best regular pies I've had in all of the city
The ingredients are all very fresh and the quality is great
If you go here, get the pan pizza for one
it tastes awesome!
Excellent Food, Personable Staff, and Inexpensive menu
The pies barely fit in the already huge pizza boxes
Jimmy always greets us by name and serves consistently good food
Great atmosphere, clean, quick service
the best pizza in the bronx, calzones that are out of sight! rated #1 in the bronx as per news 12 the bronx
And the owner Jimmy is so nice it's like everyone is family!Oh I can't forget the boy's of ronnies there graet!
The best Sicilian pizza in this area, bar none! Also try the white pizza
Jimmy is the best!
This is a take out restaurant, not a sit down place, so the real only reason to go is for the food

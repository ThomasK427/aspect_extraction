Must check out their sushi roll special! One of a kind!
Good idea
Sushi sports bar
When I go out with the little lady for sushi, I can always catch the scores
Sushi was fresh and crisp
Serve was for the most part good
There is also a back room with leather couches
And beleive it or good for Sunday football
Citysearch has this restaurant with 4$, but the Brunch menu is really a great value
The ambiance is quaint and has the French Bistro feel
The service was good, though not overly friendly
The owner sells his artwork for quite a price, but it is impressive
The portions are generous and this is the best omelet I've had so far in the city
large, juicy and quite flavorfull!
An incredible meal, both friendly and yummy
Benjamin the bartender was attentive and kind
The Manager also went above and beyond with his guests
The food was fantastic and very authentic
A little on the expensive side, but well worth it
:)
With a spectacular wine list and plenty of charm to spare, this makes for a perfect romantic meal on the Upper East Side
The food is nothing extraordinary, but remains tasty nonetheless
I highly recommend visiting once in a while just to take in the ambience and wine, but the value for the food can probably be found elsewhere
Nice lively restaurant bar with good food, generous portion, and nice atmosphere
However the service was unfriendly and slow (the waitress didn't even know which wiskey were available, and we waited a good 20min before they took our plates away)
I recomand the place if you don't mind bad service, maybe you will have more luck than us
No doubt about it the food is great, but they have to learn a thing or two about running a restaurant, my family recently stopped going there after 15 years or eating in the restaurant quite frequently, and the staff never even bought us a class of wine, or sent a free desert our way
Not to mention everyone in the place is 70 and above
Learn how to treat people
Though I've lived in the neighborhood for 7 years, I had refrained from trying Nicola's because of its reputation as treating regulars great and everyone else not so great
Well, I worry no more
I went recently with my wife and two other couples, and we had one of the best meals we've ever had in the neighborhood (and there are quite a few good restaurants around)
The food was first-rate and the service was excellent (despite the reputation)
The place may not be young and hip, but it's certainly not old and stuffy; just an excellent restaurant for mature people
Ordered Matzo Ball soup from them for Passover, when I went to serve the soup for Passover there were no Matzo balls in the containers
They would not give me my money back
I live around the corner from this particular Baluchi's, and I agree with everyone else about the service
It has always been awful
But I think the food is much better than average and get takeout very often
They have a great deal, I believe it's $13
95 these days, and you get an entree, appetizer, rice and naan
The entrees and appetizers are limited but still a good selection
It easily feeds 2-3 people with moderate appetites
The Aloo Papri is a great appetizer and the Chicken Tikka Masala always pleases
The service was just so horrible
I just went there last nite with my cousins and we were the only people there for a little bit and all three of the wait staff were coming to our table every 3 minutes or so
I didn't understand why they were in such a rush to take our plates away as soon as we put the fork down
I was very dissapointed in such poor service
The waitress was very snooty and was not polite at all
Definitely not going to this indian spot again
Food and the ambience was good though
By all appearances, the waiter was congenitally rude
The water was refilled, but plates were almost janked from under each guest, and a request to repeat what he had mumbled was fulfilled mockingly
He might improve service by speaking
I disagree with other posts about the food: I believe the cooks use to much ghee (or whatever fat/grease/oil they use), and overall the items tasted one-dimensional
The rice, however, was excellent and worth the extra charge
I doubt I'll ever go to one of these chain restaurants again
This is not what indian food is suppose to be like
I guess you can compare it with McDonalds
it's more like Bad Indian Fast Food
Have to agree, the service and attitude is terrible
But the food and ambiance was OK
Too bad cuz you deserve to eat well and be treated well
But, they didn't earn a good tip and we complained to the manager for what it's worth
The attitude must come with the high prices you pay
Left good taste in our palate, but terrible taste on our minds
I hate going out to eat and the wait staff pretend as if you don't exist
We went early on a Saturday night before the 8:00 crowd begins to pile in and still we were treated as if the place were mobbed
The service was fast but not pleasant
The waiter got aggravated when we explained how we wanted our entrees prepared
They didn't even bother to refill our water
However, the food was very good
Another fault, everything is a la carte
It's rare you have to pay extra for rice at an Indian place
It's a shame because the place was nice, the food was good and the lighting was romantic
But the wait staff's attitude will make me rethink about returning
The Scene This Upper East Side Chinese restaurant attempts to separate itself from Chinatown cliches like musty fish tanks, opting instead for refined woodwork, horse sculptures set in boxes, and overhanging glass lamps
In fact, the only tropes tat remain are stiffly formal chairs and too-bright lighting
A multitude of black-tied waiters enthusiastically serve the neighborhood-heavy clientele, while a takeout counter sequestered to the side does brisk business
The Food The menu parallels the decor's upmarket ambitions, with admirable presentation---radishes get shaped into flowers--and prices to match
A tender but tiny scallop and ginger appetizer impresses, tangy barbecue spare ribs satisfy (without reaching Chinatown heights), and fried pork dumplings, though slightly dry, pack meaty flavor
No need to veer to the Chef's Specials, like the Crispy Palace Prawns covered with a too-sweet glaze or the rack of lamb, perfectly cooked but undone by a salty garlic sauce that overwhelms the meat's naturally robust flavor
A friend brought me to this place for dim sum, and the food was SUPERB
We ordered Grand Mariner Prawns, Har Gau, dumplings, and crab claws
The prawns were just delicious
They were huge and creamy, with just a taste of tangerine
The service is pretty good too
I also got takeout -- their delivery was punctual and the food still steaming
Nice place to bring your friends or family for a treat!
I first went to Our Place about a month ago with a couple of friends, and the first thing that struck me about it was the food
Everything was absolutely delectable! Their ribs and the Shanghai soup dumplings were really good, but the Peking duck was my favorite
It was absolutely delicious, AND we got the whole duck experience
They carved it out right in front of us on the tray! The waiter told us that the duck is roasted fresh every single day, and they never sell overnight
We were very impressed with everything
The place is clean and pretty without being overly flashy
The service was prompt and the people were very friendly
All in all, we loved this place and will recommend it to anyone looking for some quality Chinese food
This is the best chinese restaurant in the city
I would like to recommend a few dishes: BBQ ribs(it's a very fresh, tasty and delicious), the chicken with spainch and walunts, the duet prawns, the shredred crispy beef, it is all delicious
I would say this is the best chinese restaurant in the up east side as well as in the city

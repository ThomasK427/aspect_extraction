I have never had any complaints
I have never been during the pre show rush so I can't say much about that
Definitely recommended if you are looking for a quality place in times square that is not over rated and touristy like every other place in that area
I have worked in Midtown for 7 years so I consider myself somewhat of a local
I have eaten at several great restaurants down in Little Italy
Trattoria Trecolori is the closest thing to Little Italy I have ever found in Midtown
You will want to make a reservation
It can fill up very quickly and without notice
This is the antidote for the tourist trap
The cook made a special dish for my kids and split it into two for the price of one
Very accomodating
Felt like I was at my Nonna's for Sunday Dinner!
Just got back from a wonderful evening of fine dining and a broadway show
My wife and I spent our first anniversary dining here and it was absolutely wonderful
Great ambiance, courteous waitstaff and an all-around terrific experience
We will definitely come back again
I scoured City Search for a place to go for my 30th birthday before my husband and I went to see a show
Thankfully I made reservations because the place was packed, but we were seated right on time
It's a bit cramped, but we got a table in the back near the kitchen and bathrooms but away from people waiting to be seated and standing at the bar
The food was good
The service was great
And the prices were perfect
What a delightful and delicious restaurant! Definitely give this a try!!!
Due to other positive reviews we decided to try this restaurant and we had dinner this past Saturday night
There are plenty of pre and post theatre customers but we did not feel like they were trying to herd us in and out like cattle
Our waiter, Mark was excellent the owners stopped by to ask how things were going
Food was reasonably priced (you can find prices across the board if you want), the selection was lengthy
and seating comfortable
It is not quiet, but that was OK, it was alive with energy
We will definitely go back
The waiters found out it was my birthday, sang and brought over desert with a candle-nice little touch
The waitstaff was exceptionally attentive and the food excellent
The prices were very reasonable, especially by New York standards
Decent wine selection
The restaurant has a cozy, welcoming feel to it
We were seated promptly (no reservations) at 9pm on a Friday night
Try the tiramisu!
great pre-theater spot but get there early, this place is hopping
the food selection was very good, the atmosphere though loud was fun
a great choice for Italian food at very reasonable prices
!
I went to dinner here on a Saturday night before the theater
The food was excellent
Service was quick and courteous
The whole restuarant, including the restrooms was immaculate
It does get very crowded, so make a reservation
With a rating of 9
0 from Citysearch, my wife and I decided we would have lunch here before the Sunday afternoon show
Although the desserts of the choco
cake and tiramisu were very good, the entree's were less than average and the hot antipasto for two was even more disappointing
Service was very good however
You live and you learn
We enjoyed this restaurant so much we ate here twice in four days
The tiramisu was the best we have ever had, don't miss it!
Stopped in before a show with my wife and had a wonderful meal
That and great service so close to the Broadway had me thinking it would be a ripoff but the bill was suprisingly reasonable
Enjoy
was seated promptly but too close to door and too many people standing by my table
waitstaff was more into pushing the sparkling water than give me a wine menu
had to wait awhile to place order
waiter was friendly but too busy to check back with us
salmon was ok but not fresh and it smelled a bit
the tiramisu was very nice to end the meal with
the Mozzarella en Carrozza was also a nice appetizer
perhaps the place is better after the theatre crowd is gone but we were in the midst of it and it wasn't a very enjoyable experience
Each time we go here, we are sat quickly
The food is excellent every time! As a garlic fan, I love that they are not shy w/ the garlic in the Penne Arrrabiata!!! The tiramasu is just as good as everyone describes and the house wine selection is pretty good
I needed to organize a rather large dinner party for work and came across this wonderful restaurant thru Citysearch
With the exceptional help of management, from my first phone call to the day of the dinner, I was made to feel that my party was their priority
The food was awesome, the room upstairs was perfect and everyone who attended was most pleased
I am looking forward to our next visit to NYC and Trattoria Trecolori!!
Great service, delicious food and nice atmosphere
I had black linguini with seafood and afterwards Tiramisu
Can recommend both and would say its among the best Italian food Ive ever had! Also, reasonably priced for such great food near Times Square, paid about $80 for two main dishes, a shared desert and wine
I had a wonderful dining experience here
The food was great, the waiters attentive, and the wine delicious! I highly recommend it for a quiet dinner for two
The homemade Tiramisu was out of this world! Great pick!
I stopped in here for a pre-theater dinner, and I must say I was very happy with my meal
I was greated within seconds and led to a table
They brought a nice basket of bread, and there was balsamic vinegar and oil at the table for bread and anything else that might need it
The veal was good, and I had a spinach and cheese soup which was also good
For dessert, the ricotta cheesecake is wonderful, and it provides a very nice finish to the meal
The atmosphere, at least on the first floor, is nothing special
If you want a really romantic date spot, this may not be the best place, but the food is good, and it is a great place to get a meal before a night at the theater
Each of the entrees we had was delicious, I especially liked the tortellini (i prefered the meat to the cheese) and the veal was superb
The desserts and cappacinos were great and I look forward to returning to the resturant again
Salads are wonderful, esp
the endive! The squid entre was to die for!!! Service could not have been better! The only thing lacking is that you have to shout because of the high noise level but I didn't mind!
Took 16 business clients to dinner based on Citysearch rating
Waiters poured wine like water, my guests were wondering out loud if they would get straws for the wine next
Tipped him $100 for 90 minutes of service and he challenged me on the tip, at the table, in front of my guests
Then complained to my guests and pointed at my face, stating that he wanted to talk man to man
Management stood aside and let this happen
Antics like this have no place in a restuarant
Worst restaurant experience in my life
I don't recommend this place to anyone!
I always recommend this restaurant to friends and visitors, even if they're not going to the theater
The staff is always pleasant and quite attentive
I once took a group of 18 (with a reservation), ordered almost everything off the menu to share, and everyone loved everything - there were NO leftovers! So far, I've recommended TT about 7 times and I have yet to have a dissatisfied customer
What's also great is that it's quite reasonable, especially the pasta dishes, and the portions are ample

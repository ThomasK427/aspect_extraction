With the suggestion of my waitress, I tried the ceviche with fresh avacado, cilantro and jalapenos
fantastic! Then I had the pan roasted halibut filet over sweet corn, grape tomatoes and chantrelle mushrooms in butter, white wine vinegar sauce
it was unbelievable
One of the best dinners I have ever had
The wine list is good and more than reasonably priced
The atmosphere both inside and in the garden is warm, comfortable and inviting
The staff is knowledgable, enthusiatic, friendly and really a great part of the DuMont experience
Thanks for a great restaurant
DuMont's food is amazing, the staff is friendly cool, the atmosphere is great
I often dream of their cheeseburger with gruyere
Try this place
you won't be disappointed
Ok, can we get over the whole idea of a nice restaurant serving mac and cheese? Yes we've all enjoyed boxed mac cheese as a kid, and we've all seen fancy mac cheese on the food channel, and tried it at various eateries and luxuriated in the irony of having such a vice prepared from scratch with real cheese--no small pleasure, that
I mention this because it's gotten to the point where even a half-assed attempt at homemade mac cheese is greeted with excitement, as shown by the reviews here for Dumont
The Dumac Cheese was a disappointing mix of 5 cheeses, none of which asserted itself to lend a distinguishing flavor--you would think that this dish, deriving its name from that of the restaurant, would be something to treasure
It is not
The food was so disappointing, I didn't notice how bad the service was
I heard great things about DuMont but am sorely disappointed by my experience
The special tuna tartare special was pretty good, but that was about it
the hangar steak was extremely chewy and tough, plus it was served cold initially, the mac cheese was bland, and the apple pear crumble was cold, when it was supposed to be served warm
The service was all right, but nothing to write home about
Sorry to say, I won't be going back
I went to Dumont for the second time last night and it is was even better than I remembered
their garden area is amazing
very nice respite from NYC streets
The mixed green salads and grilled scallops were outstanding to start
We also enjoyed the red snapper and steak (both were specials)
Attentive service and even cooler atmosphere!
We spent $50 (with tip) for a great hamburger, amazing mac n' cheese, roasted scallops (app), and chocolate souffle (dess), and 2 cafe mochas
A great deal for great food and wonderful ambiance
AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK, THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE PLACE TO RELAX
THE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD AND AFFORDABLE
THE ATMOSPHERE IS VERY FRIENDLY
THERE IS NO RUSH TO GET GOING
WE'LL BE BACK OFTEN
Dumont is a great cozy place with awesome food
I can't say enough about their mac cheese and my boyfriend is a fiend for their burgers
Colin and his staff are very attentive and seem to genuinely enjoy what they do
Dinner in their backyard garden is also a nice treat
Upon my last visit I was pleasantly surprised to find out just how good the food has gotten at DuMont
The chef seems to enjoy experimenting with a variety of disciplines and tastes, at one moment offering up classics like duck confit and the next asian glazed black sea bass
The garden has also received an upgrade, and the front room and middle bar are as relaxing and comfortable as ever
The waitstaff was relaxed, friendly and courteous, though at times seemed not very eager to please
Wait Staff was actually nice and attentive
Backyard seating was very nice
Had Mac and Cheese and burger both were good
When I ate at DuMont a few weeks ago, I had the best French toast I've EVER had in my life! (And I've had lots of French toast
) This was so amazing because it was stuffed with marscapone cheese, sprinkled with slivered almonds, and came with an orange marmalade sauce
Absolutely amazing! HOWEVER
when I came back for brunch a week or so later, I was told that the marscapone version was no longer being served, because there was a new cook
In trying to shake off my utter disappointment, I tried the new French toast, which turned out to be decent, but plain with only sprinkled powdered sugar and syrup (and at the same price)
What a let-down! So, good people of DuMont
please bring back the marscapone French toast! Your French-toast-lovin' customers will be very grateful!
I look forward to waking up on Sundays because I get to go to DuMont's
The Bloody Marys are exceptional
If I weer able to eat the special side orders fo potatoes every Sunday I wouldn't need to eat anything else all day
While the specials menu can be counted on featureing the most exciting and tasty dishes (best fish specials I've come across in williamsburg so far), it's their duMacCheese on the standard menu that I would recommend to first timers
I went to Dumont recently
A cute restaurant and average food (with a small menu)
The service was ok- for a new, small, restaurant
And as usual the waiter had to check to see if they were still open even though i arrived before the closing time
I enjoyed myself and it was overall pleasant, but (gee)- way overrated ! After reading the reveiws i am surprised - I can hardly remember what I ate let alone imagine it to be the best meal I've had in Williamsburg! Its a solid average - which to me is a 5 Small menus should have a few GREAT things
I did not find them
The service was friendly, and the food was excellent
I recommend the burgers
so GREAT
the garden is fantastic, but the food is even better
there are only a few choices but all are delicious
standouts include the hamburger and the dumac and cheese
good wine selection too and very affordable
Better than Diner and Relish, even
Somehow the meat seems better quality
And the fries are better too
It's quiet, relaxing, in fact all of the adjectives everybody else has used, including not on Bedford
Decent wines by the glass, too
I haven't been thrilled with non-burger food, but with burgers that good, I don't care
Dumont is a great and romantic spot to eat at
It's delicious! Try the steak au poivre, cooked nicely
The frites that come with it are one of my favorties in the city
This isn't a great place for vegetarians, unless you want to be subjected to eating a fish dish or not so great pasta
Beautiful outdoor seating, in the shade or sun
Slow service, but worth the wait
DuMont has been my favorite new restaurant since the moment I stepped through it's doors - I have dined innumerable times and always left COMPLETELY satisifed and grateful HOWEVER I was concerned to find out about the expansion (garden) and how the kitchen would handle it
To my dismay, amidst a wonderfully pleasant atmosphere, my garden DuMont dinner took nearly 3 hours
Bigger isn't always better guys, you just lost my business until winter
promise me you won't build a glass greehouse and serve outdoors through the colder months!!!!!
Every meal I've had here has been delicious, but I'm particularly fond of the brown leather booths
They cushion your lower and middle back, so you can really lean back and get comfortable
Who wants to sit up stick-straight in a booth? The pressed-tin ceiling is lovely, too
The Scene Loungified Long Tan brings Park Slope a reasonably priced, late-night date spot
The restaurant has several distinctly different seating areas--red banquette-flanked main hall, secluded back patio, grill-side counter seats, darkened couch nook--allowing diners to pick their desired level of privacy
The Food Heat-seeking curry fans, as well as less daring diners find much to savor on the lengthy Thai menu
Portions are generous and flavors surprisingly sophisticated
Specialties include sweet corn and succulent duck peeking through a creamy red curry, a fruity tease of mango wrapped in a delicate crab summer roll and crispy fish cakes kissed with kaffir lime
Round the meal out with tangy lemongrass, ginger, mango and coconut sorbets and adjourn to the candlelit front bar for a mellow nightcap
My girlfriend dragged me here last Saturday for our date night
It was very busy when we got there but the host had us sat after a 10 minute wait
We ordered a mojito and a mango martini and they were delicious
The menu is not traditional Thai but most of our food was great
We loved the curry puffs, the short ribs special, and the snapper

Like water for chocolate
Seduced by the food, then overcome by the desserts, I return again and again to this sweet little neighborhood gem
After the sensual pleasure of leisurely homemade tuscan entrees
the desserts capture my imagination
Freshly made by the artful hand of the chef/owner
I can only suggest what comes to mind
Chocolate Mousse, cloudlike and sexy
Mango Sorbet, it's lightness tastes better to me than the real mangoes it comes from
Tiramisu, that melts slowly across your mind
Ice cream, simply smoothly elegant
Crepes, recreating my romantic memories of crepes experienced from vendor's carts on the streets of Paris
Sublime indiscretion
A palette for the senses
Art in food
I recently had dinner here with my girlfriend
We were seated by a drafty window and wanted a new table in a warmer part of the restaurant
The head waiter bristled at this request and snapped You should have said something earlier
But we had just got there
He became visibly irritated and hustled us to a table in the back
He told us to take our old napkins and didn't put bread or olive oil on the new table
This ruined my mood at least
I was hoping the food would chher me up but things went from bad to sorse
The Chicken Mediteranneo was so lemony it was inedible
It was more like lemon with chicken
And the salad (arugula, apples, goat cheese) was bland
We won't be back
With so many Italian restaurants on the same few blocks on the UES, it's hard to find which ones are actually worth going to
Cortina has delicious Italian food that tastes like it comes from an Italian grandmother's kitchen, but is presented artistically
The rolls are warm and delicious
Eggplant parm was excellent - I would definitely get it again if I returned! Everyone was happy with their meals
The dining room is small, so it is an ideal date place
On the night I went, there was a problem in the kitchen and we waited 50 mins for dinner, but our waiter was so pleasant that we did not mind
He also gave us tiramisu (the BEST I've had anywhere) on the house because of our wait
Definitely will return to this adorable place
Don't forget to order the tiramisu
THIS WAS GREAT
from the wine, service, tasty food, very cozy and relaxing
I took my family here and they loved it
A recent discovery, I have now been back several times and each time am wowed by great taste sensations
Sitting either inside, outside or on the cusp between, this wonderfully adult and very romantic spot serves up wonderful home-made pastas and sauces
Salads are sensational and wonderfully dressed
The fried zucchini appetizer is not to be missed under any circumstances
When time for desserts (if you have ANY room left!) the chocolate mousse is sublime, as is the mango sorbet
All desserts are home-made and plentiful enough for 2, though you'll really want your own! We look forward to our visits there, coming though Central Park from the upper west side, whose Italians don't quite hold a candle to this delightful, neighbourhoody, romantic, classy place
If you never had an Italian mamma (or pappa) to cook for you, this is your chance to make up for it
Great Italian comfort food with a large variety of choices
Warm atmosphere, very old-world feeling and incredibly friendly
Homemade desserts will make your head spin
Cortina is the best kept secret on the upper east side
Fortunately I would like to tell everyone
The quality is fanatastic
Truly the chef is the Master in preparing your delightful experience
I have been dining in many resturants in New York my favorite is Cortina
I usually have two entries because the food is so good
Try it like I have you will keep going back
This place is a great little hole in the wall Indian restaurant
The inside is decorated with all sorts of dime store items - flags, leis, etc
Food is very good and prices are cheap! Go to this one, make sure you don't go to the other Indian restaurant right next door
The Margarita Pizza was Delicious, especially with thetouch of Fresh Basil on top of each slice
I had a nice time, place was crowded but the food was very good
The Scene Friends linger over coffee, sandwiches and pastries in this mellow, earth-toned cafe, while neighborhood regulars read newspapers, knit scarves and take advantage of the complimentary Wi-Fi access
Staff photos behind the bar and Monaco Grand Prix posters on the walls give the cafe a homey, albeit random touch
A shelf with magazines from Newsweek to Vogue spans the left-hand wall, and a bookshelf of novels in the back further encourages literary pursuits
The Food Scribbled on both a mirror and a chalkboard, the traditional cafe menu ranges from the expected espressos to heartier fare such as turkey-filled croissants
Of the sandwiches, the thick toasted baguette overwhelms its stuffing of apple and gooey brie, but it still satisfies the hungry student
For snacking, a low-fat berry muffin goes well with a frozen banana or papaya blend, or add a variety to your relaxation routine with hot blueberry tea
Best almond croissants around
There's no better place to hang out on a Sunday morning uptown
Pray for a nice warm day so they open the front doors
Cheyenne is my favorite! Love him!
Perhaps we went on an off day
the cafe itself is cute and quaint, but with limited seating
We went on a Sunday morning and got a nice table by the door
The cashier and sandwich maker were completely disorganized and visibly frazzled
It wasn't that busy, but they acted as though it was and everything came out haphazardly
I wasn't impressed, but I'd certainly go for a cup of coffee and sit for a little while if it's not too crowded
I was up on 95th visiting a friend and we happened upon this cafe
Beautiful view of the park and cozy ambience
Great tea selection and wonderful pastries
You can sit for hours undisturbed and find peace of mind
LOVE IT!
I love this place
It is so warm and inviting
The location is perfect right next to the B and C subways
The staff and the food are superb! Thank you for opening!!!!
This is a wonderful cafe
Great, tasty treats and delicious coffee with friendly service
Cakes and torts are excellent
Right near subway for easy access if you live outside the neighborhood
What a treat! We live in Morningside Heights and just discovered it
Have been waiting for a place like this to go and hang out
comfy leather club chairs and awesome coffee
:)
The Scene This upscale take on the classic English gastropub--with dark-wood decor accented with wooden pigs and appetizing drawings of produce--is homey and feels richly ensconced in tradition
The mood is cozy, mellow and family-friendly, though it's disrupted by the eager hordes who crowd the bar area as the evening progresses
The Food Apart from the beautifully poured pints, you won't find much you'd wouldn't see at other pubs around town
The menu combines classics like shepherd's pie, richly layered with creamy potatoes and meat, with more innovative dishes, including plump-fleshed wild bass with a piquant anchovy sauce
A simple, flavorful chowder of smoked haddock crunches with housemade crackers; the skirt steak is tastily charred and partnered with horseradish cream and celeriac, but salt is often applied with a heavy hand
The chocolate "Nemesis" cake is worth saving room for, or finish with a slice of the excellent Somerset Stilton
My boyfriend and I were very disappointed with our brunch here

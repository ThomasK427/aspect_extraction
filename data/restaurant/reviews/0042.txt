Salad course was beets and olive oil (I'm oversimplifying but that's what it tasted like), pasta course was ONE ravioli second pasta course was gnocchi, main course was quail (five full bites tops), cheese course was OK, and dessert was strawberries with balsamic and pepper
Even though the courses weren't what we had hoped or envisioned, in every instance they came up short
no surprises, no inventive flavor combinations
Also, we knew it was going to be small and we were prepared, but just know that when seated if you extended your arms out you'd be able to palm the heads of the people flanking you
And when you leave, you'll be palming your unsatisfied stomach
This is my first review
A good little restaurant with well-prepared, inventive food
Not an extensive menu but you don't' really need it
Prices are fair and service is attentive
Would definitely go back there
great food, lamb paillard sandwich to die for, and oh-so perfect gnocchi with marinated artichokes
the setting is charming, the service excellent, and you cant beat the price
Tip: go for lunch early, 12:00 say, when the place and street is quiet and enjoy the romantic and charming setting and delicious food
The food and everything about this place is great
We went on a random Wed
at ~6:45 and had one of our favorite meals in the city
We will certainly be back (if we can get in)
i loved eating at po! We were seated at a very secluded window table, so the crowd and noise wasn't an issue at all for us
Actually it ended up being very romantic
We also had the prix fix menu-the pastas were excellent, the salmon to die for, and the desserts, especially my chocolate espresso brownie was orgasmic
I highly recommend this place to anyone!!! The wine list was also impressive, the pinot bianco has become my favorite wine!
A pleasant dining experience
food was great, hearty and satisfying
The lamb was wonderful, although I could do without all the beans
This restaurant was a great value, even though I know nothing about the prix fixe menu
The best food and best service, the waitress even helped cut my entire steak dinner after I had dropped my knife on the floor due to a broken arm
Went there on a double date and enjoyed everything from the down to earth people and the great food
Tried each of the four entries we order, steak, bbq salamon, linguini, and the salad, although I thought the menu was a little limited it was perfect
only downfall was a little noisy in the beginning
All the hype
and for what?? The prix-fixe menu is supposed to be the best value in the city
not so my friends
A salad, two pastas, a minisquel quail, a piece of cheese and an average dessert left the gas-tank half-empty
The small restaurant was cosy
good thing I didn't sit near the front by the non-existent waiting area and crowded bar or near the back by the bustling kitchen
The service left something to be desired
Dishes were thrown at us in a get 'em in-get 'em out fashion that made for an unpleasant dining experience
If you're looking for value, go to the local Italian restaurant around the corner
They tried putting three of us at a table for two, with two men over 6 feet
After much ado, we were given a table for four with a paper tablecloth and a broken chair
Two people wanted the $40 tasting menu but all three had to order it
The salad greens were fair, the two pastas mediocre at best
The quail was dry
The cheese plate consisted of three quarter size samplings of cheese
Poor
Each person was given a different dessert
The brownie- bad, the cheesecake- good, the apple pie- delicious a la mode! A different server brought each course with no one person overseeing whether or not the food was to our liking
We had to ask them to slow down the pace of serving the courses, after our second pasta dish
The bill was $164 including tax and tip
Po has the best food in NY, if you don't mind a wait
Every course has something fantastic to offer even the most finicky eater
I loved it!
Dinner at PO Wednesday night was nothing short of perfect
Bottle of wine, Beet salad and the most amazing Papperdelle I've ever had
My only complaint is PO is too far from the UES, but I guess that is how they can stay so inexpensive
It's of a different caliber without Mario Batali
Cramped quarters and absolutley no waiting room make for an unacceptable experience considering the quality of food
Worth the aggravation three years ago - now I'd pass
The tiny place is adorable, the food is delicious (I especially loved the cucumber salad and the panna cotte), the service professional, and the prices reasonable
So what's wrong? The restaurant was so LOUD that conversation between the 2 of us was impossible, and the seating cramped
They rush everyone in and out - we had the 6 courses of the very reasonable tasting dinner in an hour and a half, each new dish waiting as they removed the plate from the previous course
I was exhausted and tense when I got out
I'm not going back, so all you fans - go for it
I love this tiny little place in the village
It is cozy, friendly and fun
SOme might describe the seating as tight but this ads to the charm
THe food is amazing
some of the best in the city and the prices are great
You have to reserve way in advamce, though so make sure you do
unless you go really early
THe linguine with clams, pancetta and chilies is sublime
the food tastes like home cooking
Not worth my money
The point of the reservation is to hold the reservation
- Jerry Seinfeld
The food was terrific but they had to be kidding
a 10PM reservation and they didn't seat us until after 11! They gave us a free glass of champagne to make it up to us but I'd never go back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone
Sure, you need to make a reservation well in advance and the space is rather loud, but Po is a fantastic value
flavorful, unique, and inspired Italian cuisine at very reasonable prices
The tasting menu is a steal and you will definitely not leave hungry
The wine list also features numerous affordable labels
Be forewarned however
there's no full-bar here so forget about the grappa after dinner
A small restaurant, so hard to get reservations/often a wait, but this place is worth it
The service is friendly and not overbearing and the homemade pastas are delicious
The pasta portions can be large, so bring your appetite
The fresh pea pasta is wonderful, as is the mozarella and tomato salad
Try the grapefruit sorbetto for dessert
The seating is tight, but the food and the decent prices more than make up for it
The best Italian food west of Italy! I can taste how the owner/chef got his own show on The Food Network
This restaurant is highly overrated
The food is mediocre at best
We started with the goat cheese appetizer and the smoked salmon appetizer
Decent, but nothing extraordinary
We shared the special pasta, tagliatelli with meat ragu - again, it was good, but nothing spectactular
For the entrees, we had veal picatta and the BBQ Baby Octupus
The octupus was the most flavorful thing of the whole night
The veal was nice and tender, but the flavors weren't exciting
It's shocking that this restaurant has had such rave reviews
If you want authentic Italian food with a wonderful rush-free atmosphere, jump on the train to Brooklyn and try Al Di La - now that's a restaurant to write home about

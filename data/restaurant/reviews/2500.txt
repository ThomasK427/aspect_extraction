Mana also has an short but very excellent list of wines by the glass, as well as sake and a full complement of teas and other beverages
The wait staff is friendly and attentive
All in all, it's always a pleasant experience and very satisfying
I have eaten at Mana dozens of times at it's present location and previous incarnation
I would have to list half the menu to describe my favorites but the salmon dishes are high, great grains of the day (if your early), vegetable gomae, love the yellow split pea, kanchanjiru (sp), and fish soups
Excellent brunch selections
Wait staff if very friendly, attentive
Owner 'Lee' seems to know everybody and has become a friend to me and many others
The food was just OK, but was totally overshadowed by the atrocious service
Every time I needed the very rude waiter, I had to struggle to get her attention
After a series of unpleasant incidents, although I am normally a ridiculously generous tipper, there was no way I was going to leave a tip
As I started walking down the street after leaving, she screamed at me from the restaurant
When I turned around, she came flying down the street screaming at me, Was there something wrong with the service?!!!, angry that I had not left a tip
I said, Yes, everything
She CONTINUED to follow me DOWN THE STREET screaming at me
When I said I would report her to the manager, she said, Report me to the owner; I don't care
I don't imagine the service will be getting better any time soon
Great food, big portions, affordable prices
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Morningside area
I love their outside patio, which is excellent for late night relaxation and people watching
You will not find better food for your buck!
Great dishes, always consistently good, never had a bad dish, though sometimes they're a bit on the banal side, then again I prefer spicier stuff
Service is always prompt, the decor falls in line with contemporary interior fashions, changes now and then according to tastes
Best for their dessert menu, love the cakes and tarts, yummy!!
Whether it's brunch, lunch, dinner or a nightcap, Pertutti Cafe is the place to be
First dates or mature birthday celebrations or informal interviewing, Pertutti has the right ambience, the right service and the right cuisine for the occasion
Everything on the menu screams delicious and the desserts are to die for! Cappucino, espresso herbal teas as well as a well stocked and well tended bar only add to the versatility of this Columbia University/Bank Street College of Education cafe
A trip to Pertutti would make you want to move to the upper west side
Pretty unique menu among the other restaurants around this area
Nice atmosphere
Their dishes are plated nicely and seem pretty healthy
I get take-out from here once every few weeks
You can't beat the nachos or the blackened burger
They have specials for Columbia students
The specials are unique and fabulous! I went here for my birthday, too and the atmosphere was romantic
My boyfriend and I both enjoy dining at this restaurant
The food is excellent and decor is very pleasant
Among many great food choices, I recommend skirt steak and Maryland crabcakes
As a special perk, they have live jazz every Saturday night
Definately worth your time!
We have eaten here for years and have never been disappointed
Excellent appetizers, pasta dishes, specials, great seafood, all fresh
And save room for the best apple crisp ever!
What a disappointment
This place is neither cajun, nor creole, nor capable of making a tasty burger
Especially not a burger that costs over 10 bucks
Dry, suspiciously purple-ish looking sauce, ick ick ick
Most uncomfortable chairs also - ambience non-existent
Don't even bother unless you enjoy buyer's remorse
In Short Bright floor tiles, plants and murals give this colorful family-owned restaurant a joyful atmosphere
The long, detailed menu offers an extensive variety of classic Mexican choices, including such dishes as whole red snapper in garlic sauce, grilled marinated rack of lamb, and filet mignon fajitas
A host of margaritas are available--pomegranate, kiwi, and so forth--as well as the house tequila martini
Desserts include Kahlua mousse and banana burritos
Ive been going to this place for years
It started out as a small family business but grew overnight
It was a fun atmosphere
The live mariachis, excellent food; service was awesome, and free tequila shots
The dcor made it feel like Mxico! However, in the past two years I noticed service has declined but the demand of business has increased
The food doesnt taste the same and service is rushed
The menu outside has a different one compare to the one given to you
I rarely go since its not the same as before
But I have a glimpse of hope, my once favorite spot to eat, the place I shared many memories with family and friends will come again
In the meantime Ill check on it from time to time
I do recommend the one on the east side 49th street
Ive had better luck there
This place was so bad I was embarassed that I brought my out-of-town guests here! Let's go step-by-step: 1
We waited 15 minutes just to get menus
2
We needed a high chair and they took 15 minutes to bring it to the table
3
Drinks: Each of us decided to get a cocktail so two banana daq's and 1 lemon Marg
were ordered
The drinks were so off that we all thought we tasted chemicals instead of rum and tequilla
4
Modified orders (i
e
no lettuce or no beans) were completely neglected
5
My friend's meal came out 10 minutes later than everyone else's meal
6
We objected at the ill flavor of the drinks and the manager was not understanding at all
We asked what was actually put into the drink and the server said the fruit was extract, while the manager said it was fresh fruit
7
After the meal the check didnt come for 20 minutes after we requested it
They even bussed the table before giving us the check
8
Then they ran my credit card for $55 more than the actual price of the bill
Bottom line: this place is terrible
I would not recommend this to my worst enemy! My rating says 1 star, but if -10 would have been an option, it would have been chosen
Now, I used to live in a Mexican neighborhood
There were few things I loved about it more than chowing down on a delicious authentic taco
Simple but amazing
This isn't Mama Mexico
This is to authentic Mexican what a high-caliber restaurant is to a good diner
Different
Not necessarily better or worse, depending on circumstance
The seafood here is particularly good
Their enchiladas mosqueteras are amazing and the guacamole never disappoints
Good stuff
If you are going to charge 11 dollars for guacamole, its probably best to say thats the cost before asking people if they would like guacamole the second they sit down (and before you are given the menu)

NO ONE WAS HAPPY with their appetizers nor their entrees (oily, salty and slapped on a plate)
Neither the waiter nor the so-called 'manager' cared
I could not have been more embarrased! There are so many great italian restaurants in NYC - PLEASE, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR GO ANYWHERE ELSE BUT CAMPAGNOLA
My boyfriend took me to Campagnola on a date and we had a blast
Not only food was fantastic, but our waiter Claudio was hilarious, telling jokes and talking about other clients
He made the experience even better
Ask for him adn you will enjoy your dinner
Ate there on 6/14 with my wife, parents and sister
The waitstaff couldn't have been friendlier or more accomodating
My wife, who is a vegetarian, was waited on constantly, and she enjoyed everything she ate
Being allergic to seafood, I was not able to order any of the appetizers
This was not a problem, as the waiter said they would gladly make me a pasta appetizer-sized portion of the gnocchi dish
Fantastic
The ossa buco was spectacular, and I had small tastes of my mother's veal parmigiana and my father's t-bone steak
Both excellent
The wine list is small but impressive, and they have both expensive and value-priced wines
Overall a little expensive, but if you have the money and are looking for great italian food, this place can't be beat!
From the atmosphere and the crowd to the unbelievable food, Campagnola is an experience like none other
While the dishes can be a little bit pricey, the portions are large and delicious
The menu is simple, exquisitely tasteful old- world Italian
Don't miss the specials on the chalk board- they are usually the best
I've been here 3 times now and have always recommended it to friends
This place is truley a NY restaurant
This is what dining is about, and this place could only exist in NYC
The coziness is nice, but the food is fantastic (great veal chop)- not to mention the Chilian Seabass
We have always had super service
I was compelled to put in a review after the negative review I read
That didn't make sense to me
This place is one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to
The food is superb-fresh and always hot
The desserts were outstanding too
Campagnola's ambience is pleasant and comfortable
My wife and I were given a table in the corner and very much able to enjoy ourselves in conversation even though the place was packed
As for the service I have never had a bad experience
I have found the waiters to be attentive and helpful
Even the maitre'd (who isn't exactly Mr
Warmth) is always on top of his game and ready to help you
Campagnola's is a first class restaurant
This is by far the best restaurant in NYC
The hostess / maitre'd (s) and the waiters are top notch
They make you feel like part of the family
I don't know what restaurant the other people went to but it definitely wasn't this one
Went here for my 30th bday with a large group
One of the waiters was extremely rude and was annoyed when everyone was immediately ready to order after hearing the 20 specials
We were rushed and almost forced to order both an appetizer and dessert
Food was only mediocre and I expect much more for sky high prices
The food was ok
The service was so terrible that I would never go back
The service was pushy and very in your face'
The food was good but not worth the price
The restaurant was very cold and uncomfortable at times
When we ordered items on other table the waiter commented that those items were not available that night
I was looking at another table blatantly eating those items and I confirmed with another waiter what they were eating
The veal was tough and not tender, as would be expected with a top tier Italian place
We made reservations and waited 20 minutes to be seated
and our table was empty the whole time we waited
Friends made reservations a month in advance to dine here
One of us had previously been at the restaurant with her husband
DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT WITHOUT A MALE! From the moment we arrived, we were treated like girls
For some reason, the manager felt a need to rush us
HE decided to choose our appetizers! This was neither asked for nor requested
We were then rushed to make an entre selection
At the end there was a discrepency with the bill, which when we looked it over at home later, appears to have cost us an extra $60
This so-called manager hoovered over the table as we were doing the bill
His behaviour was disgraceful! A waiter apologized for the treatment we received
He had never seen anything like it
This restaurant will never see us or anyone that we would have recommend in its door again!
This place is a gem in the upper east side! We took our father here for his birthday and went through 3 bottles of wine! The complimentary antipasta they serve is delicious! You need to definitley make reservations! The seating is close yet comfortable and cozzy
Bon Appetit!
Ok, I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about, but this place is outstanding
I received impeccable service, and the food was amazing
I doubt that I will ever find better Italian in the City
Perhaps these others just don't know the right people
but then, that's what New York is all about!
I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant in all of my life
Not only was the service sub-standard, but the food was horrible
The appetizers were o
k
, but the entree's were barely edible
The veal was one of the worst dishes I've ever tasted
Save yourself the money and go someplace else
Always consistently great steaks and chops
C'mon, Mo's a character and has been there for years! Terrific Eggs Benedict on Sundays go great with a Bullshot (vodka and beef broth)
yummmmm
My boyfriend loves it
He says they have fabulous burgers
The Sunday brunch is tastey! Just wish there were more vegetarian options on the Sunday Brunch
I can't begin to say enough about this place! Tasteful, both in food quality and decor
The shabu shabu is wonderful and the portions are huge! If you go in a group, get 2 portions to share amongst 4 people! The edamame is fabulous - cooked to perfection and almost buttery
The plum wine is surprisingly fruity and light
The servers are knowledgeable, friendly, and fast
Try this place out - you won't regret it
The key ingredient to success for Shabu-shabu is freshness
This quaint japanese restaurant safely tucked in the recesses of the upper-east side is excellent
Their sashimi is fresh and vibrant
Definitely try the omakase items since they offer excellent value
The shabu shabu itself is entertaining and rustic
The special menu is focused on what is fresh and delicious
My favorite item is still the omakase chirashi since it is always fresh
This small mezzanine serves a good, if ecclectic array of american fare (if you can stand the constant din of shoppers discussing their latest Bloomingdales purchases - the company's flagship store is across the street)

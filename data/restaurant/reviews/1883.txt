The food was fantastic
I had the Bomboloni
My mouth waters just at the thought! We sat outside the service was friendly
and met even the smallest request without reservation
We will be back for dinner with each visit! ENJOY!
I have been going there for years, and still they serve the best tiramisu and tiramisu gelato ice-cream imaginable!
The Scene Word is Jean Michel Basquiat hung out here before he got famous and then used his newfound cash to buy a loft across the street
If it wasn't the tasty jambalaya that kept him in the neighborhood, it might have been the old-school rock-and-roll jukebox, one of the finer ones in the city
You're more likely to find trust-funded youngsters stumbling home to their high-ceilinged digs than starving artists haunting the bar
The Draw  The kitchen behind the bar serves up great Cajun food--gumbo, jambalaya, catfish--and one of the better burgers in town
Seats are available both at the bar and at one of 10 tables--but get there early, because they fill up fast
Table or no, you can always count on a good bottle of Abita
Went to Great Jones Cafe for the first time the other night
The atmosphere is fun, with great music and the menu that is painted on the wall
We got a table right away, although the place is very small and a little cramped
All of the carbs we had were awesome - the sweet potato fries, garlic mashed potatoes and the cornbread, but the ribs were mediocre and the flavor of the chili was drowned out but an amazing amount of onions
Friend heard they had great burgers here, but turned out it was not so so good
Burgers were very bland like cold cows and the lettuce sucked
Mc'd's wouldve tasted better and save you nine bucks
I almost had to dump my bf after having our dinner date here
The Great Jones Cafe is unimpressive from the outside
so go inside
This tiny place has character to spare and quite simply feels like the cafes of the Big Easy
Though we had to wait 15 minutes to sit, we were able to enjoy a cold Abita Amber at the bar and browse the menu (which is painted on the wall)
To eat we had the Booya Gumbo and Jambalaya, both specials of the day
The gumbo was dark, runny and savory with a hint of spice, perfectly complimented by the thin slices of fresh French bread that accompanied it
The jambalaya was sticky and rich, but had disproportionate amount of rice to meat
Both were very flavorful and reasonably priced
The Great Jones is certainly a restaurant to visit if youre in NYC
I just have to say, I love the shaggy -- rum with spicy south carolina ginger ale
Maybe if you don't like spicy things you won't like it, but I think it's great
Jones has some of the best food I've had at reasonable prices
My only complaint is one of the guys who tells you where to sit can be very rude
Last time I went he wasn't there; I'm hoping that keeps up
My girlfriend and I had a well-priced meal at Great Jones, but please please please STAY AWAY from the spicy gingerale rum drink
I have never not finished an alcoholic drink, but this thing was utterly UNdrinkable
It tasted like carbonated water loaded with cayenne pepper
The chicken was amazing, the fries are great, and the cheese burgers look delicious!
Been going here for three years solid
Whenever I am having a really bad week, I am comforted by the thought of snuggling up to the bar at Great Jones and getting a house special Margarita
(If you can find a seat) Great Jones is a good value, with consistent food at reasonable prices
Great jukebox, but don't be surprised if you find yourself leaning up against it for a while waiting to be seated
Service is friendly, but last night my party of six was asked to get up and out after we finished our meal
First time that has happened to me there, hopefully it will be the last
Feel like southern delights? Gotcha, you're at the right place! The Gumbo went down as fast as my finger could do the thumbs-up
Ready for some hot stuff? The Cajun Martini(s) will make you walk up the wall, across the ceiling and back down on the other side
you might just want to stay for a hang-over breakfast and tickle your sore head with the best Bloody Mary in town! You go for it
If you don't mind the wait, or can somehow avoid it by going later, this place is the best for Saturday and Sunday morning hangovers
The food is delicious, biscuits and gravy are straight out of the south, and the best bloody marys anywhere
I have been eating and having fun with friends at the Jones for 15 years now
The food is always great, the people who work there are friendly and do a great job
The cajun martinis are exceptional
I recommend the Jones to people from out of town who want to eat in a real East Village neighborhood place
Yay Jones!
This quaint little had been hole-in-the-wall has been tossing Cajun delights to New York's trendy bands, poets, playwrights, and Wall Streets incognito since the early 80's
If the jukebox doesn't spin your head with images of yester-year, the barely legal Cajun Martini definitely will
This place is been converted over the past decade and is clean, benevolent, and an outright great place to loose yourself within the cement confines of the City
Try anything off the menu with the word Cajun, Crawfish or Special
We've been to the Great Jones aka The Jones many times for several years
Great service, attentive personnel, excellent food and drinks
Probably the only place left in the neighborhood where you're guaranteed a good time
From their jalepeno cornbread and cajun bloody Mary to their gumbo and rib-eye steak, this 19 year old institution delivers in every dept

Unpretentious barkeeps, an amiable waitressing staff, and a killer jukebox rounds out this very affordable restaurant/bar
The downside of this place is they don't deliver
It's cash only and they don't have valet parking
I've got a, ' jones, ' for the Jones
I don't know what that guy who is writing all the negative reviews here is talking about, but I've been here 5 or 6 times in the last year and never had a bad experience
Good, spicy cajun food, decent service, fun atmosphere, okay it ain't Chanterelle but I can't afford to eat there every night
Tough to beat for good times with your friends, drink some beer, chill out, and order with confidence
Just make sure you like the hot stuff
I moved to L
A
five years ago, and a trip to NYC is not complete without noshing at Great Jones while sipping a Cajun Martini or two
This is a terrific place to meet up with friends after work, have dinner on a Saturday night (this place can really hum in the evening), or enjoy Sunday brunch
Great Jones is cozy, has a nice neighborhood feel, a friendly staff, and serves up some very flavorful food
I just visted this restaurant tonight with a friend and enjoyed it thoroughly
Everyone was extreemly friendly and accomodating and the food was so yummy and came SO fast! The prices aren't bad either
I'm glad i found it as i was walking down the street! I'll definitely be back!
I love this place! I have been to this resturant so many times that I've lost count and the experience is always pleasurable
Have never had a problem with any component of my evening when dining here
Food is delicious and the staff is friendly, especially once you become a face they recognize
One of my favorite Italian places in all of the city, including Little Italy!
This place is wonderfully unpretentious
The gorgonzola gnocchi is absolutely delectable, although too strong, too filling and too plentiful a portion for one person--definitely to share
The waitstaff is a bit difficult to understand sometimes when they rattle off the specials, but friendly
Calamari okay
My girlfriend and I recently just stopped in here for dinner on a Friday night, we originally were supposed to go to Blue Ribbon but they had a 2 hour wait, since we were extremely hungry we wandered a bit and came across Rocco's
I'm always a little leary of trying places I've never been to or heard of but I ended up being very impressed
We were seated immediately and received great service with no rush
We had the Calamari (great sauce) and a chicken and a veal special both of which were very good
So if you're in the area and want some good Italian give this place a shot
Hands down one of my favorites in NYC
Food, service, and ambiance are excellent!
This restaurant was recommended as a humble restaurant with good food
What we got was a restaurant with subpar food and abominable service
The owner would not even allow me to use the bathroom
We had a reservation and I was waiting for the rest of the party and not sure what the name was under
I assured the owner that I was eating at his restaurant but not sure what the name of the reservation was since there was a bunch of us
He would not even let me wash my hands

I have visited numerous Indian restaurants but the food at malika surpassed any of the rest
My favorite part of the meal was the mango lassi and chocalate Kulfi that the owner graciously gave us on the house due to our big order
In short, I would just like to say that Malika is in my opinion the best restaurant in the city!
There is nothing salvageable about this restaurant
The food was dull and the service was rather poor
Please save yourself the time and avoid this one
typical diner food with great service
wait staff are friendly and try hard to get you served promptly
Average bar that becomes HELLISH on Kareoke night - watch out for the drunk hippie girl who thinks she can sing
Confirmation of the drunken salesmen
all will kill your buzz within 5
Forget those other places claiming to have the best burger in NYC
this is it
The place is not much to look at, you may just pass right by
But the food is good, the waitresses are fun and attentive
And this IS the best burger in NYC!!
I'll be honest - if this place wasn't close to the office, I wouldn't ever go
But the bartenders are great - most fresh off the boat from Ireland, and the food is surprisingly decent
Jukebox offers a fun addition, although the crowd can, at times, leave much to be desired - i
e
beware of cheesy, buzzed young salesman talking loud and acting generally irritating after their third beer
Weeknights are best for the after work scene
A good place to start your weeknight out
Was impressed by the service
The food is good too, portions are not small, the ambience is classy/romantic
The wine selection was limited but everything else was fine
I guess it's hard to judge a place especially when all that's been written about it has been negative as of lately, but I had lunch here with colleagues the other day and food was absolutely delish! Although things have undoubtedly changed, the chefs here need to be commended
At first, I thought the service was good but boy I was wrong! I called the restaurant the next day to speak to the manager/owner to let him know that I was not happy with the food especially after we paid an arm and a leg for it
My party expected the food to be great
He was SO RUDE to me! He said that Oh, so the cost of food was the issue
I couldn't believe what he was saying
The food was overpriced and it was average at best
The place has been there since 1932, I think its time to call it quits! Definitely NOT WORTH!!
In my opinion, Pietro's seasons and cooks their steaks perfectly
Order a side of fried onions, or if you prefer pasta, order the homemade gnocchi
They will melt in your mouth
Just about anything you order is great
The NY strip steak was remarkable and after I conquered this fine portion of meat, my belly was over-satisfied with the highly recommended Tira-Misu
This type of excellent tasting food is common thoughout the city, but what sets Pietro's apart is the friendly service
This place came highly recommened by an old time New Yorker
Not sure if I agree with the opinion
The chop salad was wonderful, the wine was wonderful, the waiter was great, but the main course was a bit of a let down
I had the veal chop and it was dry, but the side dish of spinach was great
The portions were great, but hard to swallow without a glass of water or wine to moisten my mouth
Next time, I'll try a steak
In Short This Manhattan mini-chain has been grilling them up and slapping them down for more than half a century
Remodeling has given the restaurants a more futuristic look, and television screens entertain the burger-munching crowds
Patties are served on toasted buns along with red relish, red onions and pickles
Fries are crisp, but there are plenty of non-burger options, including lobster salad, mixed salads and pie
Burger Heaven- how do you complain about french fries and meat!??!?! Everything was fast, delicious, and good
The only thing I didnt like was that, even though I asked for medium-well done meat, I got rare-medium pink meat
It was still delish! Also this is not fine dining prices, the simple hamburgers and fries that would have been 4 dollars elsewhere were 10 dollars here
I must warn you that hamburger and fries must be ordered seperatly
It seemed as though the order had just been placed, and our food was before us! My hubby's a very picky eater, (plain, no condiments, no cheese, just salt pepper, and onions) and as busy as they were, they got it RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!! Never has that happened before
Tourists just don't know about this small chain, thank GOD, or they don't know where to look
It's worth the effort to get to one!!
For approx
$15 or less, depending on your appetite, you can get a good lunch time meal
I had the cheeseburger platter, which came out remarkably fast and was good, especially the fresh lettuce and ripe tomatoes
The server was 'all business' but was very good and even gave me extra napkins without me having to ask
The place appeared clean and was packed
My only ding would be that the counter was very tight, though it did add to the bustling atmosphere
I LOVE the food here, great on some days
The prices are a bit ridiculous, but it is midtown, so its still better than going to Mangia, which is more expensive and just not that great
Thumbs up
Yes, it is cramped and service a bit slow at lunchtime, but that's because it's so popular! There are tons of varieties of burgers to pick from at slightly above diner prices
Not the best burgers I have ever had, but good
Seating is sort of communal at long tables
Your best bet is to go after 1 or 1:30 to beat the crowds
This is NYC, people! Places are crowded!
This place offers traditional favorites, but the rest of the menu is way beyond pub fare
The food, service and prices are all great
They just renovated and the place is beautiful
There's not much else around here that is this good
This has become an usual spot for lunch
The service is always friendly and willing to accomdate any request
The food is always tasty and we are out of the resturant in one hour
The Scene The infamous site of mobster "Big Paul" Castellano's murder (he was shot on the sidewalk outside in 1985) looks the part of a classic New York steakhouse: There's an abundance of heavy dark wood, career waiters, pastoral paintings and a predominantly portly male clientele
Service is professional and engaging
The Food The menu comprises classic steakhouse fare
A fresh lobster for the table is a fittingly indulgent way for high rollers to start off the meal; the more traditional tomato and onion salad is also quite good, and big enough to feed four
Both the incredibly tender, fist-sized filet mignon and the prime sirloin arrive with a slightly salty char and are just about perfect
Salty sauteed mushrooms and not-too-rich creamed spinach are just right alongside
For dessert, order the cheesecake--the restaurant won't say which bakery it comes from, but it's one of the best in the city
as a diehard Peter Luger fan, I didn't think anything could match PL's porterhouse
but the NY sirloin at Sparks comes pretty damn close - big, tender and expertly cooked
plus the interior at Sparks is much classier and far more sophisticated than Lugers, whose decor can be described as dorm-like at best
desserts are also wonderful, wine list is most extensive I've ever seen at any NYC restaurant, and they take credit cards
Next time I'm in the mood for a special occasion steak, I'm heading back here
This Manhattan classic (also the spot where Paul Castallino was gunned down) has possibly the best steaks in the City
It is definetly a power scene with almost all of their customers High Rollers
The wine selection is uncomparable to any other place
The service is average
Overall very pleasurable experience despite being one of the only females there
Wow, amazing restaurant
The service was prompt and invisible
They made sure you are well taken care of w/out interupting your conversations or asking you 20 questions
They also offered excellent suggestions if you have a hard time deciding
The food was impeccable
Everything from appetizer, to steak, to dessert was incredible

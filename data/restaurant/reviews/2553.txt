once you take your first bite, you'll think you're sitting in the most luxurious restaurant in the world
Also, the owner may seem a bit crusty at the get-go but just chat with him a bit and he warms up and is actually lots of fun
Once you go Patsy's, your idea of good pizza will change completely
As for my favorite Patsy's pizza -- fresh mozzarella with portobello mushrooms and fresh garlic
Big time yum
The lines on any given day are usually out the door (not hard to do since the place is small) but the food is well worth the wait
Not for those watching waist lines as everything is cooked in fat but oooh how good the fat is
The shrimp are huge and clean and the candy yams are the best ever
I always get 2 extra side dishes of maccheese and candy yams
Enjoy!
Really good service for a 'fast food' place
Quality ingredients, and good value for the price
Good 'healthy' alternatives available
In Short With friendly servers and goofy gimmicks, Chevys is a big draw for families and groups looking for a fun, affordable night out
A full bar and a dozen different margaritas attract a happy hour crowd, and a tortilla machine is often surrounded by children watching the dough-to-tortilla transformation
Fajitas, a house specialty, are available with nearly a dozen different fillings, from mesquite-grilled chicken to portobello mushrooms and asparagus
Desserts include flan and sopaipillas
We just needed to kil time before the movie but the drinks were great, service was decent and the food was really good
I have been to Chevy's a number of times and I'm not sure why
I am definately not coming any more
There is no vegetarian food on the menu
When I have asked for the vegetarian option on the nachos, each time they add some meat thing to it
It is a very unsatisfying dining experience and I leave angier than before
Being from texas
If you want bad food, with bad service, in an average setting, this place is for you
When we went, we ordered drinks, which eventually came after the food was served, one person was brought the wrong dish, the rice seemed liked it was scraped off the bottom of a large vat, half of the chips were undercooked, and the waiter seemed overwhelmed
When I go out to eat, I can usually give a place a break or two, but when they continuously get things wrong over the whole course of the meal, you know that you made a bad mistake in going there
This is definately a place I will never eat at again, and would hate for someone else to have to go through that
Went here as a last resort
our waitor wasn't particularly friendly, but he did a good job! There is virtually no vegetarian selection (alright, I lied
2 things), and one of the reasons we went there was because Mexican normally has tons of choices for vegetarians! The atmosphere was fun, food was OK
but I definitely wouldn't recommend it!
1)Service was terrible (slow, not friendly) 2)Food is a tad expensive, especially with the plethora of great Tex/Mex restaurants in NYC 3)When we complained on our way out, they seemed apathetic
the margaritas were quite good, although it took forever and a day to get the waiters attention when we were ready for round 2
the fajitas are pretty good, if dining is for two id suggest getting one order of chicken or steak fajitas, one of veggie sharing, it makes for a nice meal
not the best ive ever had, but this isnt the southwest!
This is big corporate chain dining at it's worst
The food is really basic and ok (but that'd be hard to screw up since most of these places are sent the prepackaed food) - but the service was HORRENDOUS
My friend's glass was cracked and it took forever to get the waitress' attention to get a new glass
And we got the first thing we asked for after our meal was done (which was water for everyone at the table)
Also, I just can't understand why the food cost so much
It cost more than any other tex mex restaurant I've been to
Clearly these places don't care about thier employees because these employees really don't care about working at Chevy's
Go anywhere else instead
Chain restaurant Mexican food with little taste and atmosphere
Stay away and leave it to the tourists
My mistake = giving this place a chance
Only good thing about our visit was the Appetizer Sampler plate, which was good for satisfying munchies
Chicken Caesar was beyond repair
Hardly any dressing, zero flavor, just awful - couldn't get past 2 bites
Told server to tell manager it was horrific and only received a 30% discount
Drinks not too good either
Service SUCKED
I have worked and eaten at MANY restaurants and had never seen so many servers just standing around doing NADA - with manager right next to them
Save your $
The best thing about this place is the salsa, chips, and the margs! The food is a step above most chain mexican places, and I take this place for what it is
a tourist trap in the new 42nd street (which, if you are a native new yorker or live in the neighborhood like I do avoid like the plague!) It's a fun place with friends for drinks and some quick food but don't expect the real deal
go to Mi Nidito up the street on 8th for that and better margs!
Vegetable Quesadillas had potatos and carrots in them! Hello? HUGE Margaritas that are mostly syrup
Corporate restaurant rip-off
Don't know what I enjoyed more -- the fruity, frozen margaritas or the food
The drinks are fresh and flavorful, with unusual twists like a watermelon or a mango margarita
A recent shot of Patron tequila was served with class -- in a small snifter for sipping, not shooting
Lots of favorites in the food category, too
Tamales are delicate and delicious and a rare find
Also enjoyed the pork quesadilla special
As for dessert -- huge
Order one for the whole table
We had an office party with 53 people and Chevy's did a great job! They gave us the entire third floor!  All of the food is delicious, even the Mahi Mahi
I was surprised to find well prepared fish at a mexican restaurant
, the salsa is homemade and also very good
They had lots of different margaritas with differnet types of tequilla
It's also near the broadway shows
In Short Founded in 1954, this ultracasual eatery (often with a drive-through) made its name with hamburgers cooked over flames and finished with the customer's choice of toppings
The signature sandwich has always been the Whopper, a quarter-pound burger with tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, ketchup, pickles and onions
The menu also features fish fillets and spicy chicken sandwiches, garden salads with fire-grilled shrimp and chicken, the breakfast "Croissan'wich," crispy onion rings and even veggie burgers
What differentiates one fast food establishment from another? In this case, it's more than just flame-broiled burgers
This Burger King is located deep underground
On street level, I espied the single door marked by the company logo
Hungry and rushed and nearly broke, I took the stairwell down
Once there, I felt as though the city were about to collapse on top of me
Is this windowless fire trap even legal? Going here is definitely a cheap thrill for the odd duck but if you're a fast-fix meat-patty kind of guy, might I suggest going to the Burger King a few blocks away at 8th Avenue and 40th Street?
In Short Established in 1982, this chain gained a following for its laid-back atmosphere and generous portions
Patrons settle into comfortable booths and tables in dining rooms with plants, artwork and dcor suggestive of Tuscany
Starters include scampi, sausage or pepperoni pizza, and several soup choices, as well as a signature seafood dip (crab, shrimp, cheese and marinara)
Entrees include classics like lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana
There are also "Garden Fare" options, which promise 30 percent fewer calories
I honestly can not believe that people eat at Olive Garden when they are a few short blocks away from Resturant Row in midtown
I made the mistake of being dragged there and I was so disappointed, there is nothing authentic about the food
I am not sure where there other reviews live but this is coming from a native New Yorker - go to Little Italy - you wont be disappointed
I have taken my girlfriend four times to the Olive Garden in Times Square, New York, NY
Considering the quality of the food and service and its location, you would expect to pay much more
Enjoy a great Italian meal with your significant other for $50 or less
Highly recommended!
Everytime we go there, it is very crowded
(Of course, we had to wait long time because it is crowded
If you complain about waiting, go somewhere else
) My husband and I love their food there
Pasta is very good
We also love the peach tea

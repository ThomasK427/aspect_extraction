The western atmosphere is great and the staff are all very friendly and courteous
But the food is a major let down
Disappointing steaks and burgers and the barbeque chicken was such a let down
This place reminded me of a very fancy diner with much higher prices
You just don't get what you pay for
Don't expect a quiet dinner neither, many families with screaming kinds frequent this place so beware
Really nice hidden little Japanese pleasure
Great service and food for your value
There are only two waitresses and one is the cashier too who also takes calls for takeout
Very slow
Wait forever for food
Place is small and cramp
Well
maybe one of the two best, but it is excellent and its Teriaky dishes are the most delicious in the city without question
The Lobster Roll is the trademark and it's divine
The service is friendly, and the appetizer SHUMAI are a must
The pizza is one of the best around, and their hot dishes are simply great
Try the eggplant rollatini the best around
The gnocchi sorrentino and eggplant parmigiana MELT IN YOUR MOUTH
While the Pizza is good the Italian Cuisine is FANTASTIC!!! Definitely worth finding after nearby shopping
Cascarino's makes a great pizza but there pies do lack cheese
They seem to be cheap with there cheese with the excuse that the customer can order extra cheese at an extra cost
The italian cuisine is nasty
However they have cooking there food does not know how to cook
The main courses just do not taste well seasoned
I recommend this place only for Pizza
If you want Italian go to a real Italian restaurant with real cooks
Worth the trip to Queens for the many different cheesecakes, gelato served inside of what the flavor is (lime gelato served in a lime, orange in an orange etc etc)
The balck forest cake is wonderful- gotta try this place!
Went Friday night with my GF expecting big things (at least in terms of wine) because of the name
When we were sat down, we were given a food menu but no wine menu
I had to ask for the wine menu, which was a plain piece of paper with about 8 wines on the list - 4 red and 4 white
The wines were all from unknown vineyards (which is fine since I love trying new things) but they had no vintages
I asked the waiter about the vintages of the wines, to which he replied, I don't know, probably 2003/2004
I asked if there were any older vintages and he replied that that's all they have
At this point, I didn't even ask for any suggestions, but went ahead and picked one of the two cabs they had
I don't want to come off sounding like a snob, but this is the type of wine selection I'd expect at an Applebees or a local diner, not a restaurant with a fancy decor, nice white tablecloth, candles, and a fireplace that proudly uses one of the world's top wine regions as part of its name
The food was not terrible but nothing special
After the wine experience, I actually expected worse than what was served
Definitely edible, but not inspiring
Maybe others might find this a nice local place eat in, but nothing about this place would make me want to return
We thoroughly enjoyed our food and the service was superb
The exceptional food is truly a match to the fanastic service provided by Nat upon entering
I would rate the steaks as somee of the finest I have experienced here and in Europe
A fine resturant
You can ask just about anyone in Queens where to get an awesome sandwitche, and they'll probably send you here
Open all night, this place is simply unreal
Order a TCS or a Bushman, and you'll see why
I recommend you call in your order about 20 minutes in advance, or you'll end up waiting on a long line at just about any hour of the day
I have eaten all over America and Cherry Valley has the best sandwiches I have ever had
They are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year
At peak times be prepared to wait a little for your order but it is sure worth it
My favorite is the BEAST
A fried chicken cutlet hero with melted swiss cheese, bacon, brown gravy and onion rings
They have an endless list of sandwiches and the Chicken Fingers and Fries are awesome
I recently moved to LA and I would kill for a Cherry Valley within driving distance but for now its my first stop after the airport when I visit NY
Cherry Valley is an amazing deli in Whitestone with delicious specialty sandwiches
If it's your first time, try out the TCS (fried chicken cutlet, american cheese, and gravy) on a roll/hero
All the specialty sandwiches have something fried on them for the most part, so don't come if you're looking to shed some pounds
Great place to hit up after a night on the town (if you can manage to get out to Whitestone)
Can't say enough
check it out!!!!
Choose from many different types of pizza - all fresh and appetizing
Friendly atmosphere
Dinner special a real bargain
Oven baked instead of that auto track through the oven kind
Perfect thickness of the crust so when you fold it in half it holds the cheese in, instead of it dripping out and down the front of your shirt
Just the right amount of oil secreted from the cheese to give it its unique taste
Best in the world!
I don't have much to say about the cafe itself; you can order out from the family-run cafe in the front, or take a seat in the back, which opens up to the outdoors and can offer a less seedy and more homey atmosphere
The cheesecake, however, is by far the best cheesecake I have ever tasted in my life
I would skip the stay entirely and just order the cheesecake ($15) to go
I went on Valentine's Day
They sat us in the smoking section in the back without asking our preference
And I despise smoke-filled air
When I requested a change to the non-smoking section, the waiter replied that there were no open tables
But I knew for a fact that there were open tables, just not 2 seaters although there were a few 4 person table
The waiter didn't really seem to care that we were uncomfortable
Only after we asked a second time did he notice an open 2-person table and told us we could move there
As for the food, the mocha cake I had was stale
The ice cream my boyfriend ordered wasn't anything special
The ambience was nice, but overall, thumbs down
and great place to hang out (although it was mostly HS kids Friday night and quite smoky, but less so - I heard - in front)
They ran out of the drinks my friends ordered, but the staff was eager-to-please and much appreciated
Not a bad chicken sandwich there, either
Get in early! We got there around 9:30 PM, and by 10:30 or so, there was a huge line waiting to get seated
I went to this restaurant a few days ago for lunch and it was a great experience
Our waitress was great and the food came promptly
Since we ordered a lot, we also received a lot of extra dishes on the house
The atmosphere was great, very clean, and the food was excellent
I will definitely return
The food was excellent and well worth the price
I would definitely go again
The service was on average very good
Especially the bus boys they were great and the restaurant was also very accomodating
I am a huge fan of souvlakis and gyros, but could never find one that was just right, until now
Gyro Corner is a casual place set right on a corner
It's almost always packed with people sitting in or ordering out so you know the place is gooooood
It was packed, but I was seated within 5 minutes
The basic menu is on the wall above the bar counter, but they also have a full menu to look at

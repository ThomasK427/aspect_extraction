and the vegetables were dried out and cold
When i told the manager he was very apologetic, and the waiter then came by and apologized by saying htat he had forgotten to put in the second order, and by the time he did, my salmon was done a long time ago
then we wanted to try the dessert, DO NOT GET THE TIRAMISU, b/c it is literally frozen, and you need a knife, and manpower to cut it
I was dissappointed!
My wife and I had dinner at Murals on 54 on 3/5/05
This was a great place
The decor was upscale, but unpretentious
Every person on the staff was extremely pleasant
The food was outstanding
My wife had the scallops baked in the shell, and I had the crab cakes appetizers
Both were very good (The crab cakes could have been hotter, but they were loaded with crab and that made up for it
) I had Chilean sea bass and my wife had rack of lamb
Both dishes were supurb
For dessert my wife ordered a chocolate cake that we were told would take 15 minutes to prepare
They were right on the money
Fifteen minutes after we ordered, this very decadant chocolate cake appeared from the kitchen
It didn't last long
We had a wonderful dinner and still had more than enough time to walk to the theatre
My colleague took me to Murals on 54 for dinner, and I was extremely impressed
The classy red decor around the two murals was splended - nothing overdone
Was a little overwhelmed at first- I felt like our conversation had to be kept low because of the heavy ambience, but the friendly servers made us feel at home soon after (at one point, the manager came over to see how we were doing- and he's very very cute and courteous)
We had the escargot and thai ceviche as appetizer
Ceviche was good, but escargot was spectacular
My colleague had fish (forgot exactly what- think seabass), and I had the skirt steak chimichurri which were both so good it makes my mouth water thinking back
The restaurant was more on the slow side, but we got the extra attention and were treated like VIPs
Went with a business partner to lunch hoping for fish, only to find three seafood selections on the lunch menu
Although the place's decor is very elegant, the food was fair and the service was lousy
Our server paid little attention to refilling our drinks, the runners brought the entrees out less than 1 minute after the appetizer, the server delivered another table's bill to us before we had even had entrees, and my partner's entree has a very noticable hair on his plate
And I think that all speaks for itself
This was the most amazing restaurant ever !!!
The service was exellent and the food was delicious
My boyfriend and I were having a romantice night out in the city and he found this place
I have never been to a restaurant where the service was this nice and amazing and absolutely perfect
I HIGHLY reccommend this place to anyone
The PRICE FIXE - GREAT DEAL !!
This is what I hope for when I go out to dinner
The service was the best I have ever had, attentive without feeling like the staff was joining me for dinner
The scallop appetizer is amazingly creative and equally delicious
I could go on, but I can simply say, dine at Murals on 54
We have frequented this restaurant on several occasions
Fresh, true Italian fare
Wonderful romantic atmosphere
and the food!!!! GO!
I don't know what the other two reviews were about, but Maxies was great
I was in NY on business for three days and ate there twice
The sandwich was 12
99 (but hello, it is NYC!!!) and the corn beef sandwich was the size of a football!!! The service was quick and friendly
We were seated right away, and they even granted a request for a window seat
I can't think of one complaint I had about Maxies
Great food for a great value
Def
give it a chance if you get a chance!
On the last day of my trip to New York we had only two hours before we needed to leave to the airport
This place was the first we saw so in we went
I had eggs and bacon and just that was 16
00!!!!! I asked for them scrambled and they were okay
I had eggs and bacon in a deli on I think 8th ave and it was only 3
75
they tasted muuuuuuch better than the ones I had in Maxies
The waitress had an attitude also
This place is a dump, waiters are rude and insensitive to your needs
We waited 20 mins
before any waiter came by
All the waiters were talking in the corner
Too expensive for a diner, $11
99 for eggs, RIP-OFF written all over this place, I guess they have a high turnaround of tourist, otherwise there is no reason why this restaurant is still in business
I had breakfast on my balcony at the Hilton Waikoloa, in Hawaii for less than what I paid at this restaurant
Bunch of kids working in the kitchen, very unprofessional
I am very picky on Japanese food, but the food served here is all excellent! I have taken my Japanese clients here and they were all impressed as well
The chef Takeshi, has studied his food very very well
This is not one of those Japanese restaurants where food is cooked and served by non-Japanese people
If you want to taste real Japanese food, I highly recommend this place!
not bad but not the greatest either  The sushi was average, nothing really new or special
It was fresh though
The prices are about avg
-not overly expensive but not that cheap either
The spicy maki combinations does pack a punch
the salmon maki was pretty spicy
Service is a bit slow as there is only one waitress
It took awhile for her to bring us waters
I go there because they only use white meat of the chicken for their dishes
their lomeins are over cooked but their soups are good and the kitchen looks clean
they are also fast if you want it delivered or call ahead to pickup
they are also not stingy with teh sauces - you take what you need one of the better takeouts in manhattan
This is the best Chinese takeout on the Upper Eastside
I've ordered from them for the last 3 months and every dish has been surprisingly good
The shrimp dishes are amazing
A couple friends and I went here to celebrate Cinco de Mayo
There was a wait, and although it's nice to eat outside, we basically had a view of parked cars
The food was average, our waitress was very nice, but the main draw was the margaritas and sangria
Unfortunately, as we were finishing up, the manager hovered around us and asked us to go to the bar to finish our drinks because there were other people waiting
We had just spent over $100 and all we wanted to do was finish up our last glasses of sangria- it was literally a matter of 10 minutes
This thoroughly ruined the experience and it's safe to say I will not be returning
This is a great spot for delicious Mexican food at a good price in a fun atmosphere
Margaritas are perfect start and go great with the homemade chips and salsa on the table
Fajitas (steak, chicken, veggie) are not to be missed
I had walked by here 1,000 times without giving it much notice until a friend brought me here
This type of restaurant is increasingly difficult to find on the Upper East Side
It is the nicest looking of any of the  comparable ones (Sel Poivre, for example) in this part of town
It attracts an interesting mix of locals, upscale tourists and business people from this silk-stocking hood

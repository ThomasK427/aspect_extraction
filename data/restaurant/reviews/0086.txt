The crunchy sour cream-apple-walnut pie is especially good, but you can't go wrong here: The lemon meringue is whipped up with a thick, creamy flourish, and the Southern pecan is rich and flavorful
Cakes (available in large, medium, small and if you desire, sugar-free) are all excellent, particularly the lush applesauce-carrot cake
Small cheesecake cupcakes make a sweet miniature snack; coffee and juice are available, too
I love the Little Pie Company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the Grand Central location due to their RUDE service from two sales people
First, they didn't even seem to want to sell pies as they took their time ignoring customers waiting at the counter
After I paid for my purchase, I noticed they had not given me utensils so I could eat my pie
When I walked back to the counter, the two staff people immediately retreated to the back room, glanced back at me attempting to get their attention and immediately returned to wasting time
I had to flag down a third staff person for a fork
so now it's goodbye Little RUDE Pie Company
Wonderful Mississippi Mud pie
Apple sourdough pie, and orange cake are good, as is the bundt cake with a rich chocolaty filling and the cupcakes
Decent but not memorable banana cream pie
Key lime pie was nothing special
They used to have decent ginger cookies but these were conspicously absent during our last visit
They do have a very wide selection of cakes and pies to take home
For the best pie this is the place to go! worth every penny ! and a great extra to bring to dinner parties, expect to be loved
We visited NYC for the first time last summer and stumbled across the Little Pie Company at Grand Central Station
All of the different pies that we tried were wonderful, especially the Sour Cream Apple Walnut
(be sure to have them warm it up for exrta flavor)
We can't wait to get back to NYC this April for more
I bought my father a Key Lime Pie here for christmas(he's hard to shop for) and he tasted it and said it was the best key lime pie he ever tasted!!! we were even in florida( land 'o' key lime pie
) and he refused to order it for desert because he was afraid it wasn't going to be as good as the one from the little pie company!
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better! I highly recommend the Sophia pizza
It's to die for!
Sal is the most famous and charming Pizza Man in the Lower East Side
The food is the best I've been eating at rosario's for about 25 years
Sal is the best
I've been going to Rosario's Pizza for over 20 years, since he was first on Houston St
Although I miss Pop
Sal is very friendly and makes great pizza
If you're not in the mood for pizza I'd recommend their sausage or pepper steak heros
Rosario's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence
Sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know Sal, is to know New York
He takes real pride in his food and his business
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every pie is ultra fresh
He can't help, they're bought up so fast
Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray's, Sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile, true love for his community, and let's not forget the Outstanding Pizza! He always says, I don't have customers
I only have friends
This place is fun, watching people drunk and sober, trying to hook up, doing this and that
I like this place but have had terrible service, depending on who serves me
Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order
Other than the crappy service from two individuals, it's great
i've lived all over the city and sal's pizza is by far the best i've tasted
he's also perhaps the kindest proprietor i've run across in all of the city
always gretting the regulars and newbies with a smile
the pasta's are a fabulous take-out bargain!
Good, fast service
I would highly recommend
Food is great and inexpensive
The location is perfect
Give it a try and enjoy
The Best Pizza in town!! He's been doing some remodeling and looks real nice
Hands down the best pizza parlor in all of New York
Sal knows pizza, you should get to know it too
In Short Custard Beach is located in the lower-level dining concourse of Grand Central Terminal, which features seating, many dining choices and a crowd of tourists and commuters
Four flavors of frozen custard, fat- and sugar-free frozen yogurt, sorbets, smoothies and Belgian waffles are all prepared on-site
Made with extra egg yolks, the custard has more flavor than traditional scoops; it's also got less than half the fat of premium store-bought pints
This icecream shop was originally located in Grand Central Terminal
I was just informed that it moved to Downtown Manhattan (225 Liberty St, New York, NY 10281 Tel: (212) 786-4707) The icecream from Custard Beach is honestly the best I've ever had
:) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
After you've had Custard Beach, you won't want to go back to regular ice cream
I was very upset when the one in the Village closed
Any time I go to Grand Central, I stop by
In Short Tir Na Nog takes its name from the Gaelic phrase meaning "land of eternal youth," and though its crowd is decidedly middle-aged (dark-suited business types, sports fans and Irish locals), there's a sense of youthful exuberance
With antique woodwork, wood and stone floors, stained glass, chandeliers, vintage photos and bric-a-brac, the pub setting feels homey and welcoming
The menu includes foie gras-chicken liver terrine and Irish oak-smoked salmon
went on a saturday to pre game before going out
had a blast
bartenders were cool
great bar to hang out with some friends
good food also
We had my boyfriends' birthday dinner party here on Saturday - 15 of us
The staff was extremely attentive and patient, the table had some privacy which was appreciated, and the live irish music made for a great atmosphere
The only two downsides: the hostess would not seat us until all 15 were there - even when 11 of us were crowded at the bar area
It is also a tad pricey for your typical irish bar/restaurant
even the cheeseburger is $13
My boyfriends' rib eye, which granted was large, was $30 alone
that belongs in a steakhouse!
The food was delicious and the atmosphere was very warm
Our party had an all around good time
Definitely worth checking out
This place rocks! The Yellowfin Tuna and Calf's liver are my favorites! I can't get enough of this place
It's always full, so be sure to make reservations
I've never been served by such a rude waitress anywhere! Our waitress flipped out on us for a straw wrapper falling on the floor, proceeded to give us our check without us asking for it, then told us we could finish our beers and leave
This is the first time I've been called ignorant and was thrown out of a restaurant and I don't even know why it happened
We asked to speak with the manager, but supposedly he was upstairs and did not want to come down to speak with us
For the pretty penny we dropped on the food and service, we got pretty lousy service
If you go here, trust me
you won't want to leave a tip!
Had the pleasure of a pint or two in Tir Na Nog
Great lively spot, with friendly bar staff
I've been told that dinner here is very good
But Sun brunch was very weak
Roasted breast of chicken cob salad
Dry tasteless chicken, under ripe avacado
Cheap on the blue cheese
The blue points were very good and fresh
Good beer selection
Good and pleasant service though slow

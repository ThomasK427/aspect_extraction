Ambience is great, Food is above average
I would recommend but I'm not in love with it
What can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way)
The service was pretty poor all around, the food was well below average relative to the cost, and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place
The ambiance was pretty cool, but not worth the hassle
Probably my worst dining experience in new york, and I'm a former waiter so I know what I'm talking about
Though the celery root soup was super yummy - everything else was an overpriced letdown- the plates come out looking like it's the depression era
and they actually amidst a fairly attractive tabletop served kethup in a ceramic ramekin on a plate with a doily
HoJo or SoHo
u be the judge
Nice to look at
Felt very rushed
Don't plan on getting full - portions are small and prices are high
ehhhh
the food was good the staff was snobby not a fun mix! but great atmosphere
I had a great experience at Mercer
My food was excellent and my server was polished and attentive
Good wine list
Decent cocktails
The atmosphere is fun -- dark, pulsing, basement room; a place where you feel like you can relax
I would return with out-of-town guests
My one complaint: Even though we arrived at our reservation time, the host asked us to wait at the bar -- then forgot to seat us (I had to ask)
She was apologetic and embarrassed (we were then seated right away)
More a scene than anything else
The room is still interesting
Too bad, it used to have better food
The service remains, however, as attitude-laced as ever
But I still go
This is one of the few NYC restaurants that I visit every time I come to the city from Calif
Please note that I never go without a reservation, no matter what day or time
For starters, I always get the butternut squash soup
They bring it to you in what could best be described as a water kettle
It is to die for! I've tried most of the entrees
Although they may not be out of this world, they are very good and expected
I enjoyed the dark basement like feel to the dining room, however, it was a little chilly
Aside from the over seasoned skate dish, everything was delicious! The yellowtail carpaccio and tuna spring roll were great! And the desserts were to die for
There was interesting summer dessert, a rubarb-crisp with basil ice cream
loved it
Wish they sold basil ice cream at the market
And of course, the molten chocolate cake thing was a little piece of heaven
Although my waiter had about as much personality as a dead fish, I loved the great solid food and would definately go back
The roasted beet salad and the black truffle pizza were amazing
The romantic setting is a great place for a first date ;)
Upon arriving 15min early for our researvation we were seated at the bar and had a drink
An hour later we finally asked the manager why we could not sit at the table that had been open the whole time we had been there
We were told that it was a table for 4 and that since we were 3 maybe we should have invited another person and then we could sit there
Another 15min passed and we were seated at the table for 4
Horrible Service, and the staff has such attitude! The price is not worth it at all
Our friends recommended the place
We had a good time
I found the menu simple and not very expensive by NY standards
Food and Service was good
I would go back there again
Not good, not bad
just plain jane, run of the mill
but at the price and the hype, you expect sooo much more! Service is just OK and the food is a bit less
Save the $$ and try something else, especially for a special night out
Been to the Mercer a few times and honestly, the food is good despite its trendy vibe
I absolutely agree with other posts that you get very little food for the price but the food is good
Remember you are also paying for the name
I love the decor but would not recommend sitting in the communal tables unless its a very big group, much more fun getting a table and people watch while you chomp on your $20 palm sized truffle pizza
Not the scene it used to be so if its a scene you want go somewhere else
I was there 1-22-2002
The restaurant was a little loud
The service was attentive
(I've noticed other comments to the contrary) I liked the fact that there was room to move around your tables, atypical for a NYC restaurant
The food was tasty, although as said below the portions were small, so it might not be the best value for the $$
I had the steak which was good (for a steak covered in sauce) but it was a very small size
I would have called it a petit strip
I was with a business group, so I never saw the bill
This place forces bottled water on you, I doubt it was free
Anyone know if they charge for this? If so, they didn't present it that way, and that's always something that stinks of getting taken advantage of
Like being forced to pay for bread
Mercer Kitchen is nothing out of the ordinary
It's a great space with amazing light
However, the food is only so-so
The crowd was pretty mixed
So, it's not that trendy anymore
Although, if you have nowhere to eat on a Thursday night I'd give it a shot
Finally came to Mercer Kitchen after all these years and we were not disappointed
Creative, seasonally-inspired menu and prices lower than we expected
Delicious appetizers and entrees, our server recommended a wonderful bottle of wine, and we couldn't resist dessert
Service was attentive and knowledgeable
The restaurant itself is sleek and striking
very cool to sit under the sidewalk and watch the shadows loom overhead, and the dim lighting makes the beautiful crowd look even more sexy
Terrible food, terrible service, leaking roof
There's nothing as appetizing as street slime and rain dripping on you
Truly one of the worse experiences in my three years in NYC
Saw our waiter once
They forgot to serve some drinks and the entree of one person in the party (who ended up getting it twice after everyone had finished)
A complete disaster of a meal, who just got everyone worked up and anxious to finish our 2 hour nightmare
The free champaign and desserts do not really help me to even consider going back
The service at Mercer Kitchen was the worst I have ever had in New York
They seated my party 30 minutes late, then it took the waiter nearly 25 minutes to bring us our menus and take our drink orders
After about another 10 minutes we still had not received any bread, so one of my friends stood up and served our table bread
The bus boy came over and laughed - it was not a joke, it was pathetic
The food was edible, but that is about it
There are so many excellent restaurants in New York for the same price, please take my advice and go to another one
Mercer brings its usual care and creativity to the brunch scene
I've brunched here twice, once upstairs and once downstairs

The cuisine is a highly refined, aesthetic hybrid of various eastern vegetarian ingredients
Some people love the intense, earthy exotic tastes--and some don't
Be sure people you're dining with know that they'll have to take off their shoes and sit on the floor--this can be a problem for less limber folk
This great restaurant is not well seen but you can almost smell the food walking on 38th St
between Madison and Park
As you enter this restaurant you know you did not enter the typical Italian/American restaurant you can find all over Manhattan
It's part of the Jolly Hotel Madison Towers next door (the largest Italian Hotel Chain) so Italian people own and manage this place
I was told many ingredients are shipped directly from Italy and I believe that
I am Italian myself and I felt as if I was eating the dinner my mother used to home cook for me
I started with baby octopus over fennel frittata, taggiasca olives, capers berries and herbs
I continued with HOME made buffalo ricotta raviolo with chanterelles, fava roasted tomatoes
After that I had a delicious wild striped bass served with swiss chard, fingerling potatoes, bacon, leeks and scallops
For dessert I had espresso panna cotta wich was to die for
Do yourself a favor and visit this place if you are in the mood for real italian food
They also have pre-fixe' lunch and dinner menus at $26
00 and $45
00  Rosalba
I would like to recommend a nice Italian restaurant that I discovered on 38 and Madison ( and I discovered that it is own by a real Italian hotel chain
Jolly Hotels, apparently they are all over Italy
I know the name does not sound very Italian)
Finally, I found a restaurant that serves real Italian food at a very good price and it is in midtown
The food is excellent, I felt like I was in Italy again and they also have oudoor seatting, which is very rare in Midtown
I had a fantastic Branzino
out of this world!!! and 100 year old balsamic zabaglione that I did not even know you could get in New York
The restaurant was filled with Italians
I guess the fact that it is owned by an Italian Hotel Chain makes a difference with all the wannabe other Italian Restaurant
I highly recommend it
you will be surprised

The service at Cinque Terre was absolutely horrendous
The Italian food was ok, but nothing to rave about, especially for a $26 prix-fixe: the minestrone seemed to be homemade but was bland, the veal medallions w/ mushroom/wine sauce were good but the portion was small, and the dessert (apple tart) seemed to have just left a very cold refrigerator before ending up on our plates! The service was terrible, from waiting 15 minutes for someone to take our order, to billing us a la carte instead of for the prix-fixe lunches we ordered, (after waiting a very long time) handing us the incorrect bill w/out every having come back to take our dessert order (which was included in the prixe-fixe!) I do not recommend this restaurant at all - There are much better authentic Italian restaurants throughout the city w/ better food for the same or less money
I had a wonderful dinner in this lovely place located in one of the best area of Manhattan
The service and the food was just excellent
Based on the Madison ave
locale, Moonstruck is a reliable diner to go for brunch/post-hangover/breakfast food
Newly renovated and fairly large, Moonstruck is a reliable staple when all you want is some comfort food
Compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood this one stands out
Prettier than your average diner it's great for brunch and that sweatsuit-type dinner out
Moonstruck in Murry Hill is a true reliable dining experience
They have good diner fare
While the service is fast, it may be inattentive at times, especially during late hours
The burgers are great and the fries are excellent
Delivery is also highly reliable
Great Fries, omelettes, grilled cheese, huge salads
The service sucks but that is what you get when all they care about is volume and it is cheap to boot! Best Fries in the city, hands down!!!
Very boring sort of
Italian food
Except for the name I haven't seen anything Italian there, let alone the food
very boring, not the real Italian food you would expect if you are Italian or if you have ever being to Italy
I guess it works for midwesteners tourists
Crowded, noisy, very very slow service
overprised!!! rather get a burger somewhere else
Recently I had heard so many great things about Salute
So we went there last week and to be honest it was good but far from great
The appetizers were delicious and the highlight of the meal
The Calamari was really good and the Antipasta appetizer was excellent
The main dishes were good, the ravioli de manzo was just ok
The wine selection as well as the service were very good
Again, its a good restaurant but there are several better Italian restaurants in the city
I went here with my boyfriend 2 weeks ago
We had wanted to eat at Salute for quite a while
It always seemed like a popular place after work and on the weekends
We were pleasantly surprised with a $50 four course menu, which is apparently available every Sunday evening
Start with an appetizer (soup/salad)
Then antipasti bar, entre (not the least expensive items from the menu!), and finally dessert
The best part of this deal
wine is included! The food was excellent and our server(s) were very professional and attentive
The main course took a while to arrive, but it was delicious! We will definitely return (even if it's not Sunday)!
What a place!! The food the service outstanding
Healthy portions, the ingredients explode with flavor in your mouth
I have dined both lunch and dinner and never had a bad meal at Salute
A must do with clients, friends, or family
Don't forget to ask your waiter about the Antipasta Table one of the cities best!!! Thank you Salute for giving me and my guests an outstanding experience each and every time!!!
I took my entire office to Salute last night (22 of us)
We had a superb experience
The place is lovely, and the service was PERFECT
We had none of the usual large party snafus like cold food that comes in shifts or lots of forgotten items
The servers were always there when we needed something, and everything was always where it should be on the table
The wine list is large and well constructed
The sommelier recommended very good wines and didn't push the upsell too hard
(he did try though -- just doing his job
) The food is quite good, although I wouldn't call it revolutionary or even excellent
Everyone enjoyed their meal though, which is very hard to accomplish with a party of 22
I can recommend the calamari appetizer, cold lobster salad, and the sea bass
So, for large parties -- this place is my pick
the place was booming, I haven't seen a crowd for lunch in any restaurant like this but everything ran smoothly was seated quickly great service food was delivered pretty promptly and my clients were very pleased
will be back
would like to try dinner
have been a frequent client of salute for years
but when you have michael serve you its a whole different experience
probably the most knowledgeble waiter I hve ever had and attentive to all aspects of a diners experience and the food is great too
let michael recommend
sit back and enjoy
Amazing flavor and freshness
The calamari was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside
Gnocchi and Ravioli were original and flavorful
The service was terrific
This is my new favorite Italian restaurant
I really don't understand why this place has gotten so many positive reviews
I was there on a Wednesday (not so busy) and the service was sloooooooow, the food mediocre (too salty), and the wine list unimpressive

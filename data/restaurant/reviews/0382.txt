The food was bad
I had mixed berries that were not ripe and not sweet
My companion had a tarte that was like an under-cooked eggy mess
It had the taste of raw yolks
The French couple sitting next to us each left over half of their meals, and one of them summed it up l'addition vite! (the check now!) Although the physical location has a romatic atmosphere, and street-side tables are available, there is nothing that can make up for the terrible service and bad food
I visited Marseille on a Wednesday night, and was so impressed I tried to make reservations for the weekend
Sadly, they were already booked
My food was delicious, everything from the shrimp beignets to the chopped salad
My entree, a grilled hangar steak, was incredibly tender, and the cafe beignets dessert was a perfect ending to it
Our server, Matt, was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and alot of the wines
When we asked about a wine he didn't know, the sommelier Sterling (?) came over
The two of them were both very friendly and attentive, without being intrusive
Overall, a fabulous night
I can't wait to go back!
The theater district is ALWAYS a 50/50 proposition for dinner w/tons of competition, high prices, and patrons unskilled in culinary judgement
Marseille is the gem in the hood, w/a menu that delivers and an amazing selection of wines handpicked by their sommelier (guy named Sterling) who is readily available to help you pair your food/wine
He was incredibly knowledgeable and all too happy to help us out
We enjoyed ourselves so much, we headed to the bar to spend the rest of the night hanging out
Like the dining area, their bar staff is equally accomodating
Our bartender Mike was very attentive and a skilled mixer to boot
I live near here and have been to the restaurant a couple times
The service has always been very good to excellent (knowledgeable, friendly)
The prices are fairly high, so one would expect flawless food, but thats not always the case
Recently a seafood dish was so salty that that one flaw overshadowed otherwise excellent 'side' dishes, apps desert
Again, overall excellent, but in this price range, one big flub can call into question the overall worth of the excursion
This should not be meant to dissuade anyone from going, as overall, the food, service and atmosphere has been great
but again, strict quality control at this level of dining should be strictly implemented
The appetizers and entrees were pretty decent for Southern French cooking, especially the seafood
However, my whole party was blown away by the desserts! They were really adventurous, almost reminded me of the odd ingredient-pairing at WD-50 (
almost), but not everyone digs the adventurous desserts, especially if you're craving the more common French types of desserts
I ate here last night and had the Summer Restaurant Week special Prixe Fix dinner
My friend and I both started with goat cheese salad and it was delicious, I'm not a big walnut person but enjoyed everything else
For the main I had the Pork dish while my friend ordered fish, the trout was perfect, soft meat with citrusy sauce on the side - definitely worth it! We also had the accompanying suggested Wine parings which gave us a taste of 6 different French Wines - I thought this a great idea and loved trying all the wines
I've been to Marseille twice
The food was excellent both times
The service was excellent the first time
The second time we had a surly waiter who condescended to wait on us
He seemed annoyed that we ordered from the prix fixe menu and did not order drinks
The meal was pleasant in spite of the the service
The atmosphere is rather noisy
This is a terrific place - the staff is amazing, from the moment you walk in the door you are pampered and treated like a regular
Everything was taken care of for us, from our coats and bags being brought to our table when we were ready to leave, and our server (who was busy with other tables) gave us his fullest attention
The wine list is maybe a little over-priced, but do-able
The food is incredible - from a great lamb to a seemingly simple pasta that knocks your socks off
After the evening, our server even walked us to the door to thank us again
Definitely will go back!
First, let me say that I am not accustomed to replying to postings of any sort; in fact this is my first such venture
But to hear so many derride this lovely little spot situated amid gentified tenements, urbane new york grime and the playful nature of the neighborhoods residents saddens me- truly
Marsellie is one of my standby favs, and I recommend it often to those of all income levels
The service is excellent, the staff always willing to make suggestions and go above and beyond for you
The prices are considerably within the middle-of-the-road category for a nice meal in Manhattan
And the bouillebaise is excellent, and delicate, unlike so many one finds
To those who gripe about the price, perhaps Ray's Original is indeed the way to go
Bon appetit!
We had a wonderful dining experience here The mezze ( like tapas in a Spanish restaurant) were like little works of art
The salad was very good as were the entrees
My grilled duck breast was wonderful
The desserts were adventurous
Tarragon sorbet? Yes!
Great location and decor, but portions were way too small and way overpriced
My boyfriend and I split an appetizer and a salad, then had to order an entree just to feel like we'd had a meal
The $90 tab for 1 app, 1 salad, 1 entree and 1 cocktail was shocking to us, but impressive I'm sure to people who think they're cool b/c they eat at places like this
I agree with a lot of the other reviewers re: price
Although the meal that a friend and I ordered was interesting and delicious, the portions were rather small for the somewhat high price
My bouilliabaisse was fresh, but with only a few creatures floating in a sea of otherwise yummy stock, i was still hungry
The presentation of the meze was straight out of an 80's satire
What you get is three gum drops of fabulous food for nine bucks
The veal ravioli? same thing
It was so damn good, but in the end, we left and took a stroll to the local pizza joint
There're dozens of places just like this in New York, so we weren't blown away
Everything we tasted was fine: a generous and satisfying chopped salad, a perfect lamb chop with roasted lamb loin and goat cheese, ideally grilled tuna and a simple and filling seafood burger
Service was friendly and professional, although one of our dring orders was messed up
The space is well lit and comfortable
We did agree that Marseille is a bit overpriced for what it is
If you're in Hell's Kitchen, go fo it! Otherwise, not worth a special trip
Service was good, food was good
My only complaint was the mezze
For the price of $9
00, it was a total rip-off
Literally three small bites of food
I guess they are staying true to French cuisine
very, very small portions
The food here was aweful
I don't know who is writing some of these reviews
This place wants to be so much more than it is
Had a really good meal early last Sunday/ The meat mese was incredible tartare, fois gras, and an interesting meat cigar with hummus
would go back and order two as an entree
wonderful wine selection by the glass and bottle
Though a bit pricey overall
I would return again
If it was more affordable, this would become a regular for us
Four of us ate at Marseille
The noise level was incredible until everyone left for the theater
Service was poor until then also
The food was mediocre-- not worth the cost
The menu was extremely limited
Better restaurants are to be found in many small towns along the eastern seaboard
The food was very good and unique
But I found the prices to be a bit too high for what you get
Though   I'd recommend it for corporate dinners or if you're willing to shell out a bit more for a nice pre-theater dinner

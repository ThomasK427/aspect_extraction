The food was ok, nothing special at all
The portions were very big for appetizers (calimari and fried zucchini) but average for the entrees (chicken marsala, spaghetti w/ meatballs) and very expensive of course
I think it was $40 or $50 for a steak also
No real atmosphere to speak of, just a noisy crowded resturaunt
Service was ok, the place just seemed like a step down from a great steak house and not worth it's cost
This is a great place for a large group -- but if you can't take the crowds / long wait check out Mangia e Bevi
Great on an expense account, though
At first glance, this place seems nice
The tables are candelit and romantic and they have light music in the background
However, that's where the positives about this place end
The food is terrible
My chicken was drenched in a disgusting sauce and my salad was overloaded with onion, the same went for my girlfriend
The service is okay, however the waiter towards the end was a bit pushy coming over every 90 seconds asking if we wanted the check
We will not return
The Scene Like Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day," Sardi's is trapped in the past
Formerly a canteen for celebrities, producers and the people who write about them, today it is largely an eat-and-run novelty act for the theater bus crowd
But the faded romance of the place remains in the war-weary uniformed waiters, expansive see-and-be-seen dining room, liberally pouring veteran bartenders and colorful celebrity portraits on the walls
The Food Some of the house specials have languished on stage since before the debut of "Guys and Dolls
" The stuffed cannelloni (veal, beef or sausage) is so heavy it takes one of the brawny younger staffers to haul it out; an anemic antipasti plate holds tasteless, icy peeled shrimp and sandy arugula
Stick to the simplest entrees, such as rotisserie roasted chicken or grilled filet mignon
And do not leave without tasting the single worthwhile gastronomic attraction: a hulking meringue-encrusted baked Alaska
I went with a tour group
The atmosphere is nice and the waiters are polite
The food is expensive
My dish came late so I got a free desert
I fall somewhere in the middle
I would say that the atmosphere was nothing amazing, I didn't feel like the authenticity of the history of the place was nearly as prevelant as it could have been in the experience
For someone who is very familiar with Broadway it might prove exciting
The food was good but not great
We had a nice view but it was too cold in the dining room
They did a good job getting us out in time for our show and the doorman got us a cab with a smile, which was the single best part of the restaurant
Total winner
Food, friendly wait staff
Crab cakes and rib eye was delicious! Fine dining without the uptight atmospere
While entertaining friends from out of town, we stopped into Sardi's for a pre-dinner drink and a look around
The warm welcome we received made us decide to stay for dinner -- a real treat for us
All of our food was delicious (especially the crab cakes and pork chops) and the service was outstanding! I can't wait for the next opportunity to dine in this wonderful New York and Broadway tradition
Thanks to the entire staff who made the evening very special!
Sardi's may have just average food, but the service and ambiance made up for it
They understand that most people have theatre tickets and serve promptly but without rushing you
The staff was courteous and efficient
The doorman went above and beyond the call of duty to get us a cab
A very pleasant dining experience in an enduring piece of New York tradition
I wasn't expecting much based on the Editorial Review, but this place was great
On a crowded Saturday night, we got there earlier than our reservation, but they sat us immediately
We were whisked to our table where we were promptly served drinks
We then admired all the portraits around us
We never felt rushed, though they were prompt and attentive
The food wasn't spectacular, but it was worth the price
The atmosphere is really what makes it though
It's a piece of Old New York that everyone should experience
The term living on reputation does not apply to Sardi's
We called for a dinner reservation for 7 only 2 hours before arrival
Sardi's could not have been more accommodating, the food was better than I had been lead to believe it would be, and the service was nonpariel
We spent $150 for our 3 (yes, they even split the credit card checks), and will gladly spend that much and more again

One word: We went early (6 p
m
); by 6:30 it was beginning to get crowded
On a recent visit to NYC, my wife and I had a great experience at Sardi's
After being turned down rudely at Carmine's, we went to Sardi's for a pre-theatre meal
We were immediately seated by a very friendly host
The overall servive was wonderful and the pasta and seafood dishes were out of this world
Skip Carmine's and head to Sardi's for a first class New York experience
My wife were recently in midtown and we could not disagree with the editors review more strongly
Going to Sardi's is like slipping on a comfortable pair of slippers
Why change the menu everthing on it is exceptional
If it 'aint broke don't fix it!
Weve been to Sardis on several occasion's when we catch a show
Our expectations are always met if not exceeded
This place has been around for decades because they know what they are doing
Despite what another reveiwer wrote, I beg to differ
New Yorkers can be the most fickle people and if an establishment doesnt deliver, they go elsewhere
Past reputation alone doesnt always ensure longevity in this town
Sardis clearly stands the test of time for a reason
FOOD WAS DELICIOUS,GREAT SERVICE,PRICE WAS FAIR FOR THEATRE DISTRICT
IF YOU HAVENT BEEN TO SARDIS YOUR MISSING A NEW YORK INSTITUTION!!!
My family has been patrionizing Sardis for many, many years
Im considered the youngest generation of my family and I too follow my families dining preferences
Dining at Sardis is an experience all in itself
Many famous people of today and yesterday flock to Sardis when in town and I know why
The food is perfection! The menu changes in keeping with todays trends
The daily specials are the way to go
Some of my favorite main courses are the Marinated and Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Jumbo Gulf Shrimp, Italian CannelliniBean Rgout Florentine Style and Frizzled Sweet Onions as well as their famous Crabcakes
I enjoy the ambiance and the exceptional service while dining
I look foward to passing on this tradition of eating at Sardis when I have children someday
Buon Appettio!
Our party had dinner prior to seeing a bway show
What better of a place than the world famous Sardis
It was a privledge to eat in this historical restaurant
The thought of all the celebrities that flock there was exciting
The surroundings were comfortable and cozy
The service was exceptional, the food divine!!! Now i know why its been a hangout for celebs for decades
they know a good thing! Enjoy!
Sardi's has become a cultural phenomenon, featured in many famous movies as THE place to spot celebrities
But when it comes down to it, it is just another overpriced restaurant with average food
The location is great if you are catching a show, but the food wasn't worth the price we paid
The steak was very good and the Shrimp Sardi was tasty (although the portion was kind of small)
I would recommend checking out this place once just to see what all the fuss is all about
Its not overrated if you consider the history and the atmosphere

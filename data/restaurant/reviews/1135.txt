SERVER WAS SO SWEET
SANGRIA WAS DELICIOUS
WE ARE PLANNING TO GO BACK WITH ANOTHER GROUP THIS WEEKEND
WE FLEW AWAY WITH THE FLET MIGNON CARPACCIO SPECIAL WITH ARTICHOKE HEARTS AND MANCHEGO
DRY SALTED TUNA WAS PERFECTLY DONE
GALICIAN STYLE OCTOPUS WAS TOP NOTCH
SO TENDER PERFECT WITH THE PIMENTON
AND CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE
OH MY GOD
WE COULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH
WE REALLY ENJOYED EVERYTHING
Our friends just move into this hip neighboorhood
Since they moved to Williamsburg this cute tapas bar became their favorite
For our traditional holiday gathering we choosed this place
Instantly became our favorite too
We loved the ambiance,great food,sweet yet profesional service
We had filet mignon carpaccio,mojama dry salted cured tuna, croquetasI CAN STILL TASTE THAT BECHAMEL AND SALTY JAMON INSIDE',shrimp with garlic sauce ,chorizo aldiablo, galician octopus and more
AND we finished with chocolate souffle
My god
it was more than unbelievable
I've never tried chocolate souffle like this before
excelent excellent
Food was ok but portions are tiny and pricey, even for tapas, and our party got terrible service from the manager
WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE
WE WANTED TO SEAT BUT THE LADY BEHIND TH EBAR TOLD US THERE IS A WAIT
SO WE STAYED AT THE BAT
AND TRULLY ENJOYED THE EXPERIENCE
OUR BARTENDER TOLD US ALL THE SPECIALS AND SUGGESTED COUPLE OF THEM TO TRY IT
WE WERE BLEW OF WITH THE PAN FRIED FRESH FISH RAW, WITH GRILLED CUCUMBERS AND SHARK FISH WRAPPED WITH KALE HOW ABOUT GALICIAN STYLE BAKED SCALLOPS
IT WAS SO EXCITING
THE FINALE WAS THE SOUFFLE
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE BEST CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE I'VE EVER HAD
EVERYTHING WAS SO PERFECT
AND WE WERE SO GLAD TO STAY AT THE BAR AND SHARE THE TAPAS EXPERIENCE
AFTER ALL TAPAS MEANS BAR
WILL GO BACK SOON, AND VERY SOON
The food is good but the portions are small even by tapas standards
There are a couple nice tables but they are outdoors and the place is crowded
Indoors is loud and too brightly lit
Most of all, the service was not just horrible, but we were treated with utter contempt by our waitress- who turned out to be the manager!
LAST SUNDAY WHEN WE WENT TO SEE THE GALLERIES IN WIILIAMSBURG AND FOUND THIS GEM RESTAURANT
OCTOPUS WAS EXCELLENT
SO TENDER AND TASTY,FRIED BABY CALAMARI WAS ALSO EXCELLENT
WE TRIED TO TRY ALOT OF TAPAS DISHES
STILL MORE DISHES TO DISCOVER
I AM PLANING TO TAKE ANOTHER TRIP THIS COMING SUNDAY
I'VE JUST CAME BACK FROM SPAIN

MY FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT THIS TAPAS BAR

gem in williamsburg
I've never test such a simple yet delicious food
this tapas bar creates so many seafood specials you can not believe
ask for the specials
we were there over the weekend they had more than 10 specials
I can not believe beside their big , delicious tapas menu, how possible they produce all this specials
top notch food
white sangria was perfect
right amount of sweetness,fresh fruit
not like other restaurants
service was very attantive
their outdoor seating was very pretty yet simple
this place became instantly my favourite
highly highly recommend it
our waitress was practically at our beck and call
every plate was delicious and we were full and satisfied at the end with a modest bill
get the lava chocolate cake
and the shrimp
and the pickled garlic
and some sangria
darn good sangria -- not too over-poweringly sweet, and the atmosphere was relaxed and classy
best tapas i've had in new york
wow
we had the most unforgetable night
we sat in their outdoor cafe
I still taste their white sangria
perfectly done
their jumbo scallop special,fresh grilled calamari,grilled shrimp , Galician style octopus
believe me you do not need to pay for a trip to Spain
come over to this tapas bar
you wil have an amazing experience
it is also so close to Manhattan
WE FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS PLACE BY COINSIDENCE
WE WENT TO SEE THIS SHOW NEXT DOOR
THEIR SIDEWALK CAFE WAS FULL AND EVERYBODY SEEMED LIKE HAVING A GREAT TIME
AFTER THE SHOW WE STOPPED BY
AND WE WERE AMAZED BY THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD,SIMPLICITY,PRICES , THEIR WHITE SANGRIA AND THE SERVICE
WE LIVE IN MANHATTAN AND WE WILL DEFINATELY MAKE ANOTHER TRIP NEXT WEEKEND TO BRING SOME OF OUR FRIENDS HERE
WE WERE THERE ON SUNDAY NIGHT

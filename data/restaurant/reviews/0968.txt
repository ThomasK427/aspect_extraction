I didn't mind as he wasn't intrusive in the least sense
More so, it reminded me of eating out in europe or maybe in a smalltown dinner
The waiter changed half way through our meal and the service took a sharp turn to the worst when this happened
I found Penelope's to be a charming little brunch place with GREAT FOOD! We had the Pesto Egg Sandwich (*TO DIE FOR*) and the Nutella French Toast
All delicious
Plus, I enjoyed a nice cup of coffee while I waited 10 minutes for our table
Also reasonably priced! Definitely worth bringing your friends to brunch here!
In a neighborhood overrun with lame chain restaurants, this is absolutely the best place to eat in the area
The food is always excellent, the service is wonderful, and it is SO CHEAP
The most expensive thing on the menu is the hamburger, which is $8
50
{they recently added some seafood items to their menu for the summer, so now the lobster roll is the most expensive, at $14
00} We eat there at least twice a week
It's the BEST
It's a charming little place with good 'comfort' food (i
e
macaroni cheese, grilled ham and cheese, cupcakes
) but their food is not very healthy or veggie-friendly -- heavy on the cheese and meat, and not an especially good bargain ($8-12ish for lunches)
I like their iced tea
This little neighborhood place has become one of our favorites
The light blue colored walls and the decor is just the perfect place to go to and remember what summer feels like (and in the summer - with the windows open, it's just prefect!)
Open late, it always makes for a perfect destination after a movie
Overall, the food is good (although brunch is usually a little better) and the service is always friendly and accomomdating
We are so glad Penelope opened here - we finally have a cute place, where we can all meet and have a good time
In Short This Court Street locale, formerly Max, has become a fast favorite because of its comfortable ambience and hearty homemade pastas
Well-executed staples such as homemade meat lasagna and rigatoni bolognese, an original Italian recipe, with ground beef, celery, carrots and onions, are complemented by stellar service and reasonable prices
The intimate outside garden serves as an excellent spot to enjoy a sunny lunch in warm weather
Don't skip the delicious "Dolci" options either
My husband and I went for Dine In Brooklyn and got the prix fixe
We called in advance and were told that even with a reservation we'd probably have to wait anyway, but when we showed up the place was practically empty
We ordered a skirt steak, medium-well, and a rainbow trout
The skirt steak arrived uncooked on the inside and charred on the outside
The trout was also charred, and smothered in mushroom sauce-- barely recognizable
The waitstaff chatted at the bar amongst themselves and completely ignored us for the entire meal-- which took some work, as the place is small enough with the garden closed! Two out of the three desserts on the prix fixe were unavailable, and their replacements were lame pastries from the bakery down the street
We should have ordered the homemade pasta, because that *might* have compensated for the terrible service
Excellent in every way! Food is delicious, waitstaff is on it and the atmosphere is cozy but exciting
I found it very child friendly
My picky 8 year old will eat everything on the menu, because the food is just that good
For dessert, the waiter even brings out the cheese filled pastry tube, and she gets to fill the cannoli herself! We can expect a perfect time, go early to avoid the mix of very hip and locals crowding in
My husband and I came here on Friday with friends for the 1st time after living in the neighborhood for a year
We were a little frustrated that it took a long time to be seated, and then when we were seated the service was slow, but the food made it all worth it
In fact, we ordered delivery from Fragole on Saturday, and we have never eaten at the same place twice in a row before
Amazing pastas and the fresh bread is perfect!!
I walked by this spot a thousand times before venturing in for dinner
I recommend getting one of the dishes on special, because while the regular entrees are tasty enough, they lack imagination I look for when eating out (I can make basic Italian dishes at home)
Don't bother ordering an appetizer, the complimentary bread and olive oil makes a perfect starter
Always a delight
I love the pasta, you can never go wrong woth any dish
The outside seating is lovely
Alwyas a pleasure!
Several friends and I dined at this hidden Court Street gem this Thursday and were blown away by the savory cuisine, attentive service, and reasonable prices
One of my girfriends, a Sicilian transplant, was eager to tell me that this was the most traditional Italian food she has had in Brooklyn, and I cannot say that I doubt her! It was a culinary delight and we will be back again and again
Nice cozy place, with great italian fare, very reasonable, and they deliver
All the dishes I have tried were top notch, making this the best italian joint on court street
Very reliable and tasty pastas and appetizers
Fish specials are also wonderful
Service is personal, although getting the check and getting out can be tough
Best on Court street!
In Short Situated on Bleecker Street's tourist strip, this narrow takeout spot offers a variety of dishes based on Indian bread: "naanwiches"--sandwiches and wraps made with naan, paratha rolls stuffed with potatoes and naan panini, or "naanini
" These can be dressed up with a choice of sauces and chutneys
Salads and fruity beverages are offered as well
The room, decorated with pastel walls, attracts a steady stream of NYU students and neighborhood visitors
Personally, the place is a great spot for a quick to-go lunch or a quick place to eat
Had the Aloo sandwhich (the one where the bread is folded over) which was VERY delicious, filling and great for the price
Also had the masala chai which I took home and had it over ice - made great ice tea
The other party had a spinach chicken nannini and had complaints
Apparently, it was just spinach and no chicken - 95% spinach; 5% chicken
In terms of service, the chefs of the place are working in this tiny sandwhich shop, sweating, however, they were all very accomodating and very knowledgable of their menu
Overall, I'd go again
the lamb wrap was delicious but should have been bigger or have a side dish for the price$5
50 ,the side dish was $1
00 extra
the guy at the counter did tell us before we ordered it was small
the tandoori chicken panninni was delicious and grilled well and it was tasty and perfect size-filled me up
#13 was a hot spicy chicken in naan bread and was delicious
go but very small and only hold about 15 people
I ordered the chicken panini - three words: Oh-My-G*D!!! The most delicious, hot, succulent, crispy, juicy sandwich I ever done had
Can't wait to go back
Their aloo and keema paraths remind me of my mother's cooking
Absolutely DIVINE!! Infact, I eat there so often that I've started thinking of it as my own kitchen:) I guess the price dosen't hurt either
And, yes, the desi masala chai is a must-have
my chicken paratha, at $4
50, was a ripoff
it was just a round flat bread with maybe two tablespoons of what looked and tasted like greasy bread crumbs! the filling had zero chunks of chicken, i thought it was what they scrape off the grill
and they have the nerve to put a tip cup on the counter, with a sign saying it is good karma to give tips
it is good karma to put some chicken in the chicken paratha and to give some value for the cost
indian bread company must have been having a bad night
skip it!!
Skip the flatbread and try something with their naan
The lamb naanwich was delicious and their mango lassi is a must-have
It's a gem of a place tucked in the middle of a block on bleecker street
I'd passed by it a couple of times without really noticing it, but I'm glad I decided to try it out
I had the lamb paratha saag chicken naanini, and boy, was it good!!! The paratha is a flatbread stuffed with flavorful filling, and the naanini is a grilled naan sandwich
I've never tasted this type of Indian food before, big fan of curry that I am
But, I'm ready for more!!!! And, did I mention it's quite a value for the buck? All in all, it's a place I think I'm going to get addicted to!!
hey great going
amazing food
itso ut of the world
havn't had such great food any where else
keep it up

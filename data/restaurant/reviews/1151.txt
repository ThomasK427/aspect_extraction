We didn't have the tasting menu but those arouund us loved it
The warm, fabric filled atmosphere enduces a calm relaxing dining experince
Helpful wait staff make dining at Devi the perfect romantic experience
If you enjoy Indian it's a must try
20 steps ahead of the everything on 8th street
I don't know what all of the hype is about
After reading several reviews, I was very excited about dining here
Ordered the regular tasting and was not blown away by anything
Everything was just very average
Service felt very rushed as each course came out minutes after the previous course; not that they needed our table, the restaurant wasn't full
I expect more for what I paid
I was very impressed with the decor and the food
Every inch of the place is brightly decorated and meticulously thought out
The tikki massala was only on the menu as an appetizer, but we ordered it as an entree and it was fabulous
Very nice addition to the Gramercy neighborhood
I went with great expectations and was highly disappointed
I had been when they first opened and was delighted
Things have changed now, however, and I would warn against going
Service is terrible
Our server seemed out of it, and drinks took 15 minutes to arrive
Plus, our drinkswere terrible
last time we came, the drinks were fantastic
This change in quality was apparent in the kitchen too
Our food was all over salted or over spiced
Let's recap: service, drinks, food - all noticeably worsened since I went months ago
For what they're charging, they should know better! Shame on you Devi!
Well done across the board
The hostess was pleasant, the bartender knew the wines and what they paired with, the waiter described each dish in detail, the chef chatted with us on the way out
The interior is definitely bollywood but in a subdued and rather entertaining way
The tables are pretty tightly squeezed, but each has one seat on a large shared couch which makes it more 'intimate' than 'cramped'
Food was creative, spicy and enjoyable
I recommend the prix fixe (vegetarian or with meat) as they offer a nice sampling of flavors and ingredients
The vegetarian tasting menu was incredible and completely satisfying
likely the best Indian food I've had in this city! Service was prompt and very polite
The restaurant is wrapped in warmly colored fabrics and that, along with the music, provided a wonderful atmosphere
We had quite an amazing, as well as romantic, night there
Not very romantic, you sit very close to another group of people and its hard to have a private conversation
Also, I had a gift certificate for $150, out of which we only spent $120
We wanted to leave the remaining $30 as a tip, but they wouldnt let us
They said it goes to the house This was dissapointing
just divine!the food is incredible good,the ambiance is beautiful ,the best indian restaurant in new york city!
I dunno why people say that this place is so good? First of all, I've seen some of there dishes at AMMA
Are they ripping them off?? Thats just weird
Secondly, the service seemed really shabby
They just seem to be hurried all the time
Over all experience here was horrible
The food wasnt hot when I recieved it on two seperate occasions, mind you, I only went back a second time to give them another chance
This place is WAY overrated
The decor is nice but thats about it
Bottom line, if you wanna find good indian food dont go here, unless you wanna eat average food with nice decor
TAKE MY ADVICE, YOU WONT REGRET IT
And here I thought I would miss Cafe 18, which used to be in this space
The food is divine--there's no other word for it
The ambience is gorgeous
The wait staff is ubiquitous without being a nuisance, and very polite (almost too polite--they won't disturb you if you're in a conversation, and that's when I need my drink refilled the most)
The butter chicken, the Phool Makhane Kee Sabzee (creamy lotus seed stuff), and the Paneer Kundan Kaaliya (cheese patties in tomato sauce) are particularly stand-out
This has to be the best Indian place I have ever been to in the city
The food was inventive and delicious, and the service was sharp
I would definitely recommend the tasting menu and there are many reasonably priced wines by the bottle
The place looked great, the service was impeccable and all of the food was spectacular
Unlike many other of the more up-market NYC restaurants, Devi is definitely worth repeat visits
We did not order the tasting menu but all ordered different dishes
All of them were fantastic
Leave it to Suvir - the tasting menu is the way to go, especially if you are hungry and ready for a taste sensation
It's an incredible value and one amazing course is followed by an even more delicious one
I did not think they could top the savory offerings, but the desserts are awe inspiring
The chai panacotta is truly perfection
I went to Devi for dinner and drinks with my girlfriends and it was amazing! I started off with a mango blood orange martini that was one of the best drinks I've ever tasted (indian restaurant or not!) All of the drinkswe had were awesome
I can't remember them all
one was this concord grape champagne cocktail with elderflower (i think?)  The food was amazing
I had this manchurian cauliflower that was incredible and a dish of lotus seeds that were decadent
These are things I've never tasted before and will probablly never forget
The lamb chops were so succulent and the desserts were insane
mango cheesecakeand chai pannacotta were the ones i had and i coulda had more! The wine list is suprisingly well priced and the service was perfect
Ambiance is romantic but also whimsical
I would rate Devi #1 of all the highend indian places I've been in nyc
Not in the mood (or right company) for downscale, but authentic Indian food -- then go to Devi
Many upscale places don't hit the mark, losing authenticity with excess 'fusion' (i
e
Tabla), or trendy decor (i
e
Tamarind)
But I thought Devi was a great balance, with nice innovations (try the drinks), without losing appreciation for wonderful, authentic Indian flavors
Plus, the decor has genuine (looking) decorations, imported wooden doors, and marble carvings
Very cool
Devi is a very good restaurant
Very innovative cooking from Suvir and Hemant
Very nice decor with bright colors and subdued lighting
Excellent
The Scene The tranquilly hip gather in this sleek, stunning expanse marked by soaring ceilings, antique wood panels and offbeat accents, such as an eel trap adorned with flowers
The greetings shouted by the dining room staff, however, feel a little too Benihana amid such high design
The Food This Tokyo import aims to show New Yorkers how it's really done in the Far East, serving Japanese "pub fare" with a modern twist
The extensive menu spans the familiar, with dishes like a tataki of superior-quality beef with an arousing ginger sauce; the rare, with freshly made tofu, its ultra-creamy texture wowing more than its flavor
The odd mochi croquettes are stuffed with duck and potato and sit in a lukewarm, characterless broth
Desserts range from a grainy sake ice cream to a tasty trio of smooth, mellow puddings (green tea, sake and citrus) served in tiny sake glasses
This place is right next to my apartment, and is the first restaurant I went to in the Village
I was expecting just average Japanese food, nothing out of the ordinary
but I was surprised by food that was extraordinary
I started with the tuna and avocado salad, and the tuna just melted in my mouth
I then went on to have the duck and potato croquette, not knowing what to expect, but I was incredibly satisfied

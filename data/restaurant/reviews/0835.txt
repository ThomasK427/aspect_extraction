Two dishes I can recommend are the coq au vin and the pork tenderloin
Also, they now have a liquor license
I wanted to sit at the bar with an old friend and just enjoy a glass of wine
But the bartender girl was absolutely rude and not attentive
I had to ask for a menu a few times before actually a very kind busboy give it to us
The bartender ignored us trough the 2 hours we spend there (there was only one more customer at the bar, and he was't happy with the service either)
She wouldn't even notice our empty glasses
I do go to Bacchus a lot, and usually I like the food, but last weekend turned really sour
Appearently she is an 'experienced' bartender-- she also bartends on Smith Street in a restaurant as I learned later
Recently I have called Bacchus to arrange for a party of 25
I left my phone numbers with someone on two occassions, but noone called me back
On my way home from work I went into the restaurant to talk to an owner or manager
I only found a very young waitress who hardly even seemed to understand what I planned to do at this establishment
I also asked for a chef (thought that may be able to talk about the food for the party), but the waitress said that there was no chef at the restaurant
I was just glad that I found out these things about Bacchus before I would have booked a dinner party there
No more to say, I booked the party somewhere else, and it went very well!
What a nice experience, I went there with a date and I had such a great time
Service was friendly, no attitude, good food
Just the kind of restaurant experience you would like to have every time
And the prices are excellent
I will be a regular at this place
The Scene This cheery sliver of a spot, bright with yellow porthole lights and bouncy pop music, attracts after-school teens, lunching theater folks and weekenders on their way out of town--all happily indulging their inner child with gooey-good grilled cheese sandwiches
Take a seat at a wood table along the walls--it's just as swift as takeaway
The Food Start with the basic grilled cheese--two chubby, buttered, sourdough slices dripping with cheddar or Swiss--or one of a dozen artfully crafted sandwiches, and personalize with the likes of chewy olive bread, fresh micro-greens or Gorgonzola, gouda and Brie
Ham and queso blanco with garlic-pepper aioli is perfection, but the chicken melt, overstuffed with sauteed red onions, spicy avocado and American cheese, is even better with bacon
There are satisfying homemade soups like white bean-spinach, simple mesclun-mix salads in balsamic vinaigrette and cheesy chips, like Combos and Doritos, by the bag
I went to this place for lunch and it was great
Lots of sandwich options on thick bread - I had the chicken melt, which had cheddar and avacado spread and it was great
My friend and I each had a sandwich and a drink and our bill came to $18
We were seated and served quickly, but we had to wait a really long time to get our bill - I felt bad for the waiter, since he was the only one serving the whole place
Also, the place is tiny and there are only 2-person tables
My friends and I were hungry but were overwhelmed with the choices in the area
Say Cheese's name sounded interesting, so we went in
It's very tiny inside, but I quickly forgot about that
The staff was very friendly and acommodating and the food was just amazing and well-priced! Gourmet grilled cheese! I recommended the $4 (generously sized) Reese's smoothie!!
Went in on my lunch hour, sat for 15 minutes, finally decided to wait in line for my food
Upon reaching the front of said line 15 minutes after that, was told I needed to, you guessed it, sit down and wait to be served
I sat again, but received no indication that I was about to be served - no silverware, no water, nothing
Finally I walked out
So I have no idea how the grilled cheese is, but if you are going here on your lunch hour, don't expect to find out
Who knew that an alley of a shop with wooden tables and chairs and low lighting, could be so full of good eats and good cheer? I do not know the name of the guy who serves you but he is always so welcoming, polite and makes u feel right at home
I have been there many times with a magazine or a book, ordered a YUMMY sandwich and curly fries and just sat there reading away and enjoying my meal
No one bothered me and the food is just right to comfort a tired soul on a shoe string budget!
I LOVE this place! Myself and my boyfriend ate there for $15 total and were stuffed
Great grilled cheese (obviously) and the cheddar tomato soup nearly made me crap myself with glee
The staff is super friendly and the place is unpretentious and welcoming
Definitely recommend!
Try the cuban - it is out of this world
I am not a fan of cream based soups but their tomato was incredible
This is a must!!
You'll feel like you stumbled upon a little secret kitchen
Very tasty food
The Cheddar Tomato soup is great
Beware: NO BATHROOM
The sandwiches were surprisingly delicious, and the service was top notch
I'll definitely be visiting Say Cheese again in the future!
Wow - I was shocked at how great the sandwiches were! They are loaded with food and come to your table when they're still too hot to eat with your hands - talk about FRESH! The ingredients are stellar and the olive bread is a great addition to the traditional sandwich
YUM YUM YUM
My co-worker I tried this place
We went right @ Noon
It got crowded about half hour later
The food was great and our waiter was cool
The prices were cheap
I'll be back
This place has the best grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever had
ever! Plus the curly fries are awesome! The gentleman who runs the place has to be one of the nicest people I have ever met
He is fantastic and always on the ball
This place has probably the best sandwiches I have tasted in a very long time
Since I have been going I have tried all of them
And they are all good
Tasty is an understatement
They are fabulous!!!
I wasn't very impressed with the food, especially the shakes which were awful
While the chicken pesto was good, the tuna sandwich was nothing special, even cheap, the food wasn't all that
Try the Big Cheese (red peppers, red onions, muenster, provolone, and swiss) with grilled chicken, gouda, and avocado - it's hard to find a better, more decadent sandwich
The tune with plumb tomotoes and cheddar, the Tuba Schmuna, is great too
A lite atmosphere and many great, creative takes on the old grilled cheese sandwich
definitely check it out
Was here on Saturday evening, had a great meal at a great rate
Enjoyed the dessert
The place is perfect in everyway
The personal is great
The Coffee Teas are exquisite
They have food for everyone from soups to nuts
The guy Mark is very friendly and makes everyone feel important and equal
The bands solos aritists are fantastic, and the art on the walls makes me feel like I am in a Manhattan Cafe'
They even have open mic poetry on Sunday's
You won't be sorry once you go there, and you will definitely go back
Really nice vibe here
Live jazz, poetry readings comfortable chairs
Free wireless internet access for those with a laptop
I havent even mentioned their excellent coffee and paninis
Id say places of character like this are sorely lacking in this neighborhood
I recently moved here from brooklyn and this place reminds me of some of the coffee houses you might find on bedford avenue minus the wannabe hipsters
Over all a great experience
I dont know why there would be a negative feedback
The food and service at munch has always been really good
Ive never had a problem except one time with they were short staffed
My wife and I are there every week and the service is never less than friendly and wonderful
The food is always hot and flavorful and the variety is plenty

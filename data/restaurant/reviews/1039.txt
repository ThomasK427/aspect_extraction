I went in for a red velvet cupcake as well as a vanilla cupcake and needless to say, they were both bland
The red velvet cupcake was indeed moist however flavorless as was the icing
The vanilla cupcake was dry with a heap of buttercream icing which happened to be the best part of cupcake
I think that for as bland as they both were, they were highly over priced
Should I decide to go back, I will try something else in order to see if this bakery is really worth visiting a third time
The staff was more than friendly and the store was clean
but the cakes I ate looked better than they tasted
The red velvet cake was pretty good and moist - burgundy red and sweet white icing
I was disappointed with the cherry chocolate cake, which is a misnomer, as the only cherry was on top of the cake
Additionally, the cake filling itself was very bland - just your typical corner bakery chocolate cake
The pineapple upside down cake was an utter disappointment, being that it was merely white cake with a few pineapples stuck to the top and glazed with a pineapple flavored jelly
Friendly staff and great decor
The best cup cakes in NYC
I also tried the chocolate cake and it was amazing
I have tried a dozen other dessert places in the city and this one had the best cupcakes and cakes
The icing (even the pink one) is amazing
Went by today for the first time since reading about it in IN Style Magazine
The Red Velvet Cupcakes were so moist and delicious
Though it was a bit busy, the service was friendly and attentive
I give it to them for making the amount of product they do in that small space, only in New York! p

Try the peanut butter pie
enough said!
Beware the new cupcake rules in Manhattan
I stopped by Billy's Bakery to pick up 18 cupcakes for a company birthday party
While they had plenty of cupcakes in the display case and plenty drying on the rack, they insisted I could only buy 12 (although the woman before me bought 15), because they just got a large order in
I'm well aware of their 24 hr rule to order a cake, but the cupcake rule is new, not posted, and aribitrary
How silly to loose a steady customer (and one who used to sing their praises) because of 3 cupcakes
Sorry, Billy
When Billy's first opened it was great! Light cupcakes, perfect frosting and great service was the highlight of this bakery
The last three times I went, the cupcakes were dry and the frosting was hard
Cakes use to be THREE layes and they would give large slices for $4
Now it is TWO layers and the slices are half the size for the same $4
Last year I ordered a cake for my mother's birthday and when I opened the cake box at home, there were spots on the side of the cake where you could see the cake
no frosting! I had to go back to Billy's and ask for frosting in a cup to put it on myself
WHAT HAPPENED? I hate when a place is great at first to get you hooked and then turns to trash!
Cupcakes were stale
Ordered coconut cream pie 'to-go', opened box and it was banana cream
In a response to my complaint, the owner admitted having problems in Feb
w/their baked goods and stated, As far as a pie slice confusion all I suggest is to watch what they put in your box/check it before you leave
Not my responsiblity to ensure correctness
Cupcakes schmupcakes! Billy's is best for other desserts
Try the banana layer cake with cream cheese frosting
You won't be sorry
If the portion's too large, share it with a friend or take it home
Warning: highly addictive
Sooo good
I took my family to Billy's after the theatre and they couldn't believe this place existed
The vibe was great, the service was friendly, and the dessert was out of this world
You have to try the chocolate cake with vanilla frosting, its soo moist! Oh
and their hot chocolate is the best I've had in the city
3 friends of mine and I moved around the corner from Billy's two months ago
The cupcakes are incredible, MOIST and just the perfect amount sugary
The peanutbutter chocolate pie is quite possibly the best thing I ever tasted in my life
Good luck to Billy's and congratulations for making it to Food Network, the place looked great
I've been to Billy's about 3 or 4 times within the last month with friends to try their different desserts
Out of their pumpkin square bars, cherry cheesecake, pecan cheesecake, icebox cake, cupackes and banana cake, I have to say that only the pumpkin square piqued my interest
The frosting on the cupcakes lacked falvor and the cake part was pretty dry
The service was good, though, and the staff is quite friendly
If you're looking for a place to grab something sweet in a pinch, this is the place
However, if you looking for something sinful and worth the calories, I'd try somewhere else
I went to Billy's two months ago and agreed that the cupcakes were some of the best in NYC
However, I returned yesterday and bought a box of 9 assorted cupcakes, but I probably should have asked for 9 of the freshest cupcakes
None of the cupcakes were fresh: the vanilla ones actually had a hard crust just under the frosting
The cupcakes were so dry that they flaked apart upon separating from cupcake wraps, and I couldn't take a bite without drinking something to help it move through my throat
I've never had cupcakes this dry before in my life
The chocolate frosting was also hard, like the kind you buy in the betty crocker container
Needless to say, I felt like I wasted my $18
75 this time on cupcakes I could have made much better
Sorry Billy's
Somebody said theyve got the best cupcake in the city
I totally disagree with that
The cupcake is BAD
The cake is so dry
The icing is OK but why we need just an OK cupcake since we can get a much better one down the road
When I have some desert, I need to feel happy eating it
This place made me very disappointed afterward and feeling bad all day long
Billy's has the best cupcakes in the city
The topping is not too sweet or buttery
which means you don't feel over guilty about eating more than one at a time
The best part is that it's a zillion times more hygenic than Magnolia
You don't have all these people picking up cupcakes and putting them back down coz their friends wanted some other color topping, etc
The cupcakes are unbelievable but that's all you should expect to get out of this experience
The cakes and pies are also above average but pricey and you have to know what you want ahead of time and place you're your order days ahead of time
Very small and the service was a little unfriendly
Not sure what the heck they are putting in those cupcakes
but there's something about a Billy's cupcake that makes my knees buckle
Who needs chocolate? My boyfriend likes to buy me Billy's cupcakes just to watch the look on my face as I'm eating them ;-)
Ostentatiously stylish I must say! On my venture to the East Coast from Portland Oregon back in March 2004, I happen to stumble upon a quaint bakery on 9th Ave in Chelsea,never seeing anything as comparable back on the west coast, I indulged in most delectable treats
I could not resist the moist mouthwatering cupcakes before the words, I will have two of those please fell from my mouth
The service was outstanding, and I couldn't help but make a daily trip to Billy's Bakery during my stay in New York City! I highly recommend this lovely Bakery
I stopped by Billy's Bakery on my trip through New York with friends
I highly recommend this bakery to anyone who is in the area wanting a taste of delight!! A friendly staff and very reasonable!!
This place brings a smile to my face
The desserts are incredible (very fresh, great designs on the cakes, unique products) and the staff is sooo friendly
Everyone goes out of their way to take care of you here
I've been several times and can say it only gets better
I wanted to like the cupcakes here
in fact, I expected to! After they won the NY Daily News taste test and all the raves, I went here expecting to order 150 cupcakes for a party
Went with a friend we both had a chocolate a vanilla cupcake each

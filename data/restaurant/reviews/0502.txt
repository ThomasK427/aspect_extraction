If someone needs to use the bathroom, everyone must get up, so that table can be pulled out, freeing them to leave confines of their seat! No felt on bottom of the chair legs, so all night you heard chairs scraping on floor
Linens were of cheap fabric
As night (Friday) progressed, noise level got worse
Prosciutto was excellent, melted in mouth, but very costly at $18!! Veal ravioli was very good
However, my chicken dish was just chunks of meat, some very fatty, just thrown on a plate (although flavor of dish was pretty good)
Overall, very poor presentation in all the dishes
As we left, restaurant and bar were packed
This place is clearly a scene, but if you're a true foodie, or want a nice dining experience, go elsewhere
Sure, the staff doesn't thank you for comnig, - they're far too crowded for that
But the're quick, the food is good and well prepared, they're attentive in refilling your glass, and the environment is dynamic, cosmopolite and informal in a stylish way
I have been going to Downtown Cipriani's for over 5 years and have never had a bad meal
The food is top notch and that is not even the best aspect of the restaurant
It is a great scene and is the place to see and be seen
Fay Da has been a consistent place where I can depend on inexpensive drinks and dim sum treats anytime of the week
The service is prompt and very helpful when they help you pick out dim sum items (bbq pork buns, egg tarts, Char siew sou, etc) and when you're confused about certain drinks
The place is not large with only a few tables and a small counter, it can get crowded (big time) during the weekend
While the ladies behind the counter are probably more akin to speaking Cantonese, tourists should feel no worries about communicating with them in English
This store is loaded with very different pastries, the best thing about is the price
but I always go in for the drinks they have this very special treat call bubble drink you get to pick all sort of different flavors, little cute Asian Style bakery store with great music too
As the fabric of the area changed from Little Italy to the now fashionable Nolita, I am glad that Parisi is still around and remains unchanged
I have been going there for over twenty years and I am glad they did not give way to some hipster bar or boutique
To put it simply, they make the best hero sandwiches around
Fresh bread, heaps of toppings and great prices
There's usually a wait at lunch time when the local Police and firemen fill up the place but its worth the wait
Go to Parisi for a taste of Little Italy how it used to be
It took 100 years for Parisi to get around to making pizza (at least I don't think they ever made it before this year)
but it was worth the wait
The sauce is excellent (very fresh) with dabs of real mozzarella
The bread is top notch as well
Recommended to ALL pizza lovers and highly recommened for those who like: 1) sicilian style pizza  2) lots of sauce and a minimal amount of cheese
Once the pride of Little Italy, this worn out bakery has gone stale
Their baguettes are surprisingly tough and their loaves a bit bland
If you happen to have the unfortunate luck of running across their rude service people or brutish management, you'll feel like you are on the wrong side of a bad Soprano's episode
With so many fine bakeries in the neighborhood, I'd say just keep looking elsewhere
The somewhat unknown Pizza Town II has the best pizza in NY
Whenever I am in the city I make a trip to Pizza Town for a slice
Burgers are delicious
They are served on Focacchia bread and are to die for
Also get the Onion Rings -- best we've ever had
I love the food here! I can honestly say that everytime I've been here, it's been a tasty, inexpensive delight! I would love to eat at the Barking Dog everynight
My favorite are the specials
The food is SO flavorful
It's truly amazing
Both locations are delicious!
This hotel is located at the Grand Hyatt New York so more than likely if you're staying there or have stayed there, you may have eaten there
I do recommend this place
They have a great bar and the staff is on top of everything
I have to admit, I had my first official authentic New York cheesecake here and it was sooo good
Food is great, dessert is wonderful
I recommend
We so enjoyed our dinner, the food was wonderful, black angus beef cooked to perfection, the wait staff were extremely professional, courteous and helpful
The decor was lush, cozy and
perfect
We were a group of six, no problems in taking special care with each person within our group
I highly recommend the Commodore Grill at the Grand Hyatt Hotel located at 42nd and Lexington, in the hear of Manhatten
Awesome! Can't wait to go back
A beautiful atmosphere, perfect for drinks and/or appetizers
Dinner is a different story
Highly overpriced
Cuisine is billed as asian fusion - doesn't meet the bill
This place is a great idea especially for a neighborhood that needs more cafe's
There is just one catch
the service stinks
And I live across the street
Often they are closing up as I get there, and they make it known
WE ARE CLOSING! Is what I heard one night on my way home when I decided I'd like a slice of pie
Just a slice of pie!!! If they had heard me out they would have been 3
00 richer
Not to mention the rude teenagers they hire who just have don't care attitudes
On the other hand the food is good
When they have it
I have gone back 3 times for that same slice of pie
If they actually had an open close time I wouldn't have bothered
I don't think you should either
The only hesitation I have in writing this review is that this thoughtful cafe could become overpopulated
This is the secret quiet place you're looking for when you want to escape the Wall Street area or the touristy Fish Market
The staff is welcoming
This is an example of small business at its finest
This a coffee + sandwich shop that will let you read and be thoughful
The food was fresh, fairly priced and satisfying
Let's rethink downtown the way this cafe did
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you

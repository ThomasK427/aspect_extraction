The beans with perfectly cooked and just slightly salty and the rice was fluffy and yummy
Everyone at the bar was friendly and gave great service
I would highly recommend LOBO and cannot wait until they open the back garden this Spring!
Lobo is a find! Certainly worth the trip from Manhattan
The food was delish -- not your run-of-the mill Tex Mex
The place is warm and friendly -- like the wait staff
The margaritas can't be beat! And all at very reasonable prices
we were hoping that this place would be better than pacifico, and it was, but not much
it's a nice looking place with good service, but the food was pretty bland
it seems we just can't get good mexican in this neighborhood
I am from California and not once have I tasted Mexican food like this! All of you that have been searching
I have found it
Everything is outstanding
you can not go wrong! The prices are so cheap it will blow your mind
Great for everyone and the Margarita's are mouth watering
Check it out East Coasters and West Coasters
you will never have food like this unless you head to Texas or better yet Mexico!
Found this right near my office and the French owners greeted everyone at the door like they were family
Homemade French crepes are made in the window on crepe irons and the sandwiches are awesome
So delicious
It's a pleasant surprise to feel like they know you and smile at everyone while promptly serving up great bistro fare
Good food atmosphere is always a real New Yorker's best interest
The homemade international array of food french cuisine are really a delight with the international sassay music in the background
This trendy cafe offers both at reasonable prices and great service
I appreciate a cafe that serves with grace if you're an out of towner this is one place you don't want to miss
The Scene Decked out in bright purples and oranges and a whole greenhouse worth of plants, Pequena looks more like a hippie grandmother's refuge than a hipster hangout
But the outfits on the front porch--lots of Castro caps and T-shirts bearing ironic slogans--clearly demark 21st-century Brooklyn
The Draw As the only decent Mexican spot in Fort Greene, Pequena can get away with less-than-authentic fare
Tortilla soup makes a promising beginning, the rich broth flecked with cojita, but the dressing on a shrimp and avocado salad tastes suspiciously bottle-like
Made with fresh ingredients, entrees favor milder palettes: Rotisserie chicken gets little relief from the accompanying bland rice and soupy black beans, while beef fajitas suffer too much grease
For simple, more reliable pleasure, try the tacos with a shot of creamy guac and hot sauce
Finish with tartly tempting Key-lime pie, a truly revolutionary capper
really does look like a hip grandmother's place
Too tiny but worth the wait
Margarita is a great accompaniment to their mexican brunch menu
If you like mexican, you will like this place
The quality of the food at Pequena is exceptional
I just moved to New York from Texas and I have to admit that it was refreshing to enjoy Mexican fare that wasn't covered in greasy cheese
The restaurant is, well, small as the name suggests but the staff is very good at getting you seated as soon as possible
My suggestions are the bean dip, pork tacos, and the half chicken
My only complaint is the high price of the drinks, but maybe I am too used to drinking all night for $12 like you can in Texas
I like Pequena a lot -- I've only lived in Fort Greene for a couple of weeks, and they're already on the delivery hotlist
I have to say, though, that they haven't ironed out the delivery kinks
Last time I ordered, it took three tries before they brought all the food I ordered, although a waitress actually ran to my house with the last correction, which was sweet
The food is highly recommended, especially the sweet plaintains with creme fraiche and oaxacan cheese
Mmm
The green sauce is not for the faint of heart
I've been very pleased with the quality of food and drink at this darling place
It IS small, which can be a bummer if you've got a lot of friends to bring along
But it's perfect for a pre-BAM meal, and the prices are great
Take adavantage of the 2 for 1 margaritas, and split a plate of food
If you get chips guacamole before, you'll find that's an ample meal for you with plenty of drinks!
Pequena is the best mexican food in town- fresh, flavorful and delicious
The fish tacos are amazing
Even the margaritas are made from fresh lime juice
The waitstaff is super nice
They'll even call you at the neighboring bar if there is a wait
we go as often as possible, brunch or dinner
It should not be missed
Pequena is a cute little mexican place that is perfect to sit and enjoy good drinks and great food
It quickly became one of our staples!! I would definitely recommend checking it out!
My husband and I stopped by Pequena for what we hoped would be a quick bite
We had been to Pequena before and loved the food
We ordered appetizers and a couple drinks
An hour later, all we had were our drinks
Not once did the waitress stop by to talk to us
When we tried to get her attention, she ignored us
We finally asked for the food to go
This took another 20 minutes! When we got our food, the waitress barely said a word as she placed our take-out on the table and grabbed the check
We are laidback diners and as we've both waited tables, we tend to be forgiving of irregular service
However, this waitress was downright surly, and by the time we left, we felt miserable, hungry, and furious
We will never go back to Pequena again
we just got home from dinner at pequena
we've had good experiences there in the past, but the service can be disappointing
tonight (a slow monday night), we sat down at the same time as another couple and they had eaten their meal and left by the time we were brought our food
the waitress did not offer to give us anything to compensate for the late food until we were so hungry we asked for something to tide us over
in the end, the only discount they gave us was for the cost of one drink
we thought that was pretty lame considering we are usually loyal customers
so, when you go to pequena don't be surprised if you feel as if you aren't exactly their top priority
I previously had posted a so-so review for Pequena, stating the food did not have enough flavor and was not as great as I'd expect
Well, I had to come back and give them a better rating after my most recent experiences
They have really started turning out great dishes and seem to have worked the kinks out
Still some of the fastest delivery times in all of Ft
Greene is a great bonus! Their fish tacos are a standout
The Scene Uncomplicated, tasteful touches--a soothing abstract painting, an exposed brick wall, a tiny bar--grace the restaurant's neutral-toned interior
The adept waitstaff moves between the tightly packed tables, delivering plates of rich, hearty fare to the neighborhood's 30-something gastronomes and oenophiles
The Food Former Chef of Washington Park Daniel Eardley leans heavily on seasonal ingredients: An autumn appetizer of duck salad bursts with ripe pomegranate seeds; tender grilled octopus with peppers and turnips is a starter must for every table
Entrees continue the theme, employing earthy ingredients, often in unconventional ways
Spaghetti, tossed with gorgonzola, cabbage and celery root, packs an uncharacteristic bite, and the ample ribeye is nicely spiced by the subtly sweet onion jam
Desserts, such as apple quince pie and chocolate cake, are good enough, but don't merit the loosening of a belt buckle
Instead finish with the fragrant peppermint tea, which arrives in an individual French press
I've passed this place dozens of times and somehow managed to overlook it for an entire year
Have tried it twice recently and am won over
The downright savory stuffed pork chop (an item I'd not ordinarly be drawn to, but figured I'd give a go) exceeded my expectations
I have never had a pork chop so satisfying
While the appetizers I sampled (gnocchi; shrimp wrapped in coconut or somesuch) were not so impressive (the gnocchi portion is meager and overpriced), my table was 100% satisfied with their entrees too
The wait (35 min
after finishing appetizers) for a hanger steak during my 2nd visit this past weekend was unreasonable, but, once it arrived, I needed just one taste of it and the accompanying fingerling potatoes before all was forgiven
Absolutely fantastic and [though I hate to admit it]
worth the wait

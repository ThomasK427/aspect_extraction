I did not didn't think the food could have gotten better than last yesr but it did
Next time i will not wait so long to go back
My girlfriend suprised me for Valentine's Day and took me to Moda
From the minute we walked through the door we were made to feel special
The General Manager of the restaurant personally sat us seconds after walking through the door
The waitress Gina was very friendly and helpful
Even thought the restaurant was packed she still made sure that we received great service
The food was also amazing
As a chef working in the Boston area I thought the food preparation and presentation were top notch
I tip my hat to Moda
They really made our first valentine's together very special
Everything that could go wrong did starting with the set menu that I was not informed of at the time of the reservation, to trying to seat us 45 minutes late at a table that was not made up
They ran out of certain dishes and said nothing when they brought replacement items to the table
I heard about MODA through a mutual friend - decided to check it out and loved every minute of it
There was a great buzz and atmosphere at the bar - the martini's were AMAZING!! The service was great and the food was fabulous
The grilled tuna and the grilled salmon was the best I have had in a while
I was pleasantly surprised as my experience with hotel restaurant dining has left a lot to be desired
Not only will I go back, but I will tell all my friends to go as well!!
Met a few friend for drinks in the lounge this past Thursday GREAT MARTINIS, the next day we decided to go for dinner food and service was just as good
We will return to try different things on the menu
Try it you will like it
The place was really nice, elegant and beautiful
A really simple look
The wait staff had a couple of quick mix-ups, but overall good
The chef even gave us an extra appetizer, because it was taking long (it really wasn't that long), but the food was so-so
I guess I was expecting more
We ordered room service and specifcally ordered two of the beef filets medium to rare
When they came, both were dripping in blood! The inside was completely pink and red from the blood and they were both cold to boot! When they took them back, they practically burnt them to a crisp, but didnt bother to warm the rest of the food on the plate, so that by the time we got around to eating them, almost an hour and a half after ordering, the filets were seemingly spitefully burnt (beyond recognition) and the vegetables and potatoes were cold! The bill: 174 and change
Not what I expect when I shell out that kind of money
Went with my mom, uncle and cousin for a pre-theater bite
We all LOVED it
Instead of ordering main courses we just ordered a bunch of small plates and shared
The ravioli with mushrooms and leeks was outstanding - we asked the waiter for more bread to mop up the sauce and the polenta with gorgonzola was heavenly
Some drawbacks - Tomato risotto was a bit bland and the famous artichoke appetizer is no longer on the menu
The service was abit slow especially since our waiter knew we had theater tix but he was very nice
Over all - a great find in the theater district
Last Saturday we went with another couple for dinner
The food was even more outstanding then the first time we went
The wine was excellent and the food was just incredible
Our waiter, Marcello, was so helpful and knowledgeable in evey way
You can tell, he enjoys his job
This will definitely be the restaurant for us and all of our friends
The chef is just outstanding!!!
Very good food but please shut out that horrible music
Maybe the DJ was paticularly bad that night but he ruined our dining experience
you don't go to the restaurant to put up with terrible music
If the music was well mixed I would definitely recommend this fantastic restaurant
Excellent service, tasty bread+olives+cheese, beautifully presented dishes
I am sorry for the chef
One of my friends who goes to school at NYU took me to Deville for dinner (I hadn't heard of it, but she said she loved it), and it was surprisingly great! The lighting IS probably a bit too low, but if you're on a date, it would be romantic (not to mention flattering)
Music is probably a little loud too
but other than that, the food is fantastic
Their salads were very fresh and generously sized, and the salmon was really outstanding
It was actually probably the nicest piece of fish (not including sushi) that I've had in the city, and it was perfectly cooked
The mild lemon/butter sauce was a great complement to the dish, as was the nicely garlic-y haricots verts and yummy rice
The chocolate volcano is an EXCELLENT finish to the meal, and the coconut ice cream that accompanies it is soooo tasty (as is the yummy cookie shell it comes in)
Service was average
our waiter was a little oblivious of the fact that our water glasses were often left empty (though he kept taking a water pitcher to the tables around us?) But a really nice 3-course meal for between $30-40 (plus drinks)
definitely worth checking out!
Great place for a date, not cheap but not a bank-breaker
Door is friendly, staff is almost always prompt for seating or drinks
The bartender downstairs is a MACHINE
he's fantastic
The music is pretty great, especially on friday nights with WeAreRobots
I've been several times and I always reccomend it when someone asks for a good spot
Walking to my seat I almost trip because the lights were turned down so low, no one can see
I don't know what kind of atmosphere they were trying to make, but it was not working
I was too distracted by the loud music
The waiter was very nice and the staff was as well
However management can be improved as I overhear the manager on duty criticizing my waiter who was doing just fine
The food I could make in my microwave and for the price, I would definitely prefer my microwave
I tipped generously feeling sorry for the waiter having to work there
If you are choosing between two places to dine at, one of them being Cafe Deville, do yourself a favor and choose the other
I visited this restaurant recently and was pleasantly surprised
They have a nice selection of appetizers; we had the tomato mozerella appetizer which was very decent
Our server very attentive and helpful
His name was Christian and I highly recommend requesting him if you visit
My wife had the Seared Tuna which excellent and I ordered my Onglet a'Lechalotte Medium Well and it was a little overcooked for my taste, but it's always this way at every French restaurant I've been to
The Mashed Potatoes and the french fries were extremely good
Christian recommended the Ginger Cheesecake with Pomegranate Sauce and we're really glad we listened, because it was amazing
Overall, the restaurant has a nice atmosphere, but don't expect to get in and out quickly
Go there to wind down and have a nice meal or drinks
The bar looked interesting and well stocked
Went for dinner on a quiet Wednesday night
Great service by nice waitresses; the food was very good and arrived fairly quickly
Overall a very pleasant experience
Our Tuesday night meal was marred by poor service from our waitress
The outdoors seating area was packed, so we sat just indoors, where the ambience was quite nice, but the large space was almost empty
Our waitress couldn't tell us what was in the seafood special, forgot to put in our oyster order so it came at the same time as the main meals, wasn't able to provide a confident recommendation from the menu, and had to be flagged several times for drinks
The food was average; the drinks were not great
The blood orange caipirinha was obviously not blood orange and the $10 peach bellini had a small amount of grainy puree at the bottom of the glass
There are much better french bistros in the East Village
The prices are fairly reasonable (for food, not drinks), but this is another New York City example of you-get-what-you-pay-for
I went on a Friday or Saturday, I can't remember which although I believe it was Saturday, and had a great time
The atmosphere was just right
The music was pumping, the DJ was on point with the RB and reggae, most people were dancing, the food was good, but service was so-so
I went back a different night, once again I can't remember which, probably Friday and the place was a ghost town, with a corny DJ and a waitress who couldn't get my friend's drink right after several tries
My first experience was so good though
I will definately give it another try
On a Saturday

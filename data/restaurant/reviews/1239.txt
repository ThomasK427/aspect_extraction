The food was delicious and the service lovely
I will definitely try dinner, but they do need to fix the kitchen shifts so that people get served in a reasonable time
I have never written in before but I had to warn you about this place
I already wrote this once but the 300 words of bad stuff that I had to write about this place was too many (you can only use 150 words here), so here it is in a nutshell
We had a 9:15 reservation
We weren't seated until 9:45
At 11:00 we still did not have our main course
After we purchased our first bottle of wine, we ordered a second one - they ran out of every wine under $40
Everyone was rude, no one apologized and when we asked to speak with the owner and calmly explained the problem, he asked us to leave - yelling at us!!!! I have never experienced anything like this and I have eaten at the nicest and most casual places in the city
This was just ridiculous
This restaurant is small and intimate
The menu is great and the specials change daily - I had a great miso glazed halibut with avocado
I've been twice and between friends have tried close to everything on the menu
All of us agreed that it was some of the best food we've had in a long time
The service was friendly and informative
Great drink menu from well made mojitos to fabulously chosen wines
The best part is that is that the food comes first- NOT having a trendy, hip joint
I was told that the menu items (especially fish) will change according to what is the most freshly available at given times
Our favorites: amazing caesar salad - the mussles in red curry are divine - the salmon w/ asparagus and polenta was beautifuly presented and melted in my mouth! Overall, this will be a west village favorite for years to come
This is a our newest and most welcome neighbor
We stopped in during the first big snow storm this winter
Everyone agreed that the food was excellent and the service quick and helpful
Been there twice since and the salmon was amazing (citric flavored asparagus rocks), chicken is best in the area, special boullibase was greatr and the starters have all been wonderful
I highly recommend Alexandra for a cozy, neighborhood outing; it's not a fancy night out
Has a small bar too for those quick drinks or lingering bar dinners
Go soon before it's mobbed
Note: That banging you might here, is the pipes
Landlord is a bit of a dip it seems
Adds to the charm, but if loud noises annoy you, sit on the left side or away from the front right window
Also, there was no sign on the bathroom door
My sister and I took our dad to BOCA JUNIORS Steakhouse in Queens for Father's Day and we absolutely loved it
The place seems to be very popular and had alot of business, so it's important to call ahead and order a table (eventhough it says no rsvp needed) especially on a day like Father's Day
Yes it was loud, but that didn't bother us- we weren't there for a quiet/romantic dinner- this place is something like a sports restaurant (since they have two big plasma screens (muted) and lots of sports memorbilias on the walls to look at
) The place is pretty big, has a tiny bar so it's mostly tables
They play wonderful tango's and Boca team-themed songs (which my father happily sang along to -reminiscing his youunger days in the Buenos Aires based Boca Junior games
) We were very pleased with the food and somewhat pleased with the service, but like in any restaurant on a day like Father's Day- the service is never perfect! The waiters were all uniformed like soccer players, so that added to this uniquely themed atmostphere! I recommend it to any sports fan or Argentinian or anyone in general who won't mind a little bit of fun noise while they eat their juicy Churrasco or Parrillada!! Ciao!
Noisy, Crowded
Being Argentinian I've visited most if not all of the Arg
restaurants in New York, and Boca in my opinion is one of the worst
I went only once, and the experience was bad enough that it doesnt merit a second chance
The tables are set up too close, which makes it crowded and loud
My bife de Chorizo arrived at the table luke warm and not medium-well as I had requested, furthermore it was fatty and nervy
Sorry guys, I love Boca Jrs, but not the restaurant
My family and I went to Boca Juniors over the weekend for the first time
As soon as we entered we noticed how crowded the place was and how everyone seemed to be enjoying there food
We waited about twenty minutes to a half hour and finally got seated
The food was excellent
I ordered a steak and it was delicious
It was cooked the way we had asked our waiter to have it done it
The waiter made sure that we had the proper service and had everything we needed
The wine selection was beyond amazing
Highly recommended from the waiter
I recommend you, that when you go to Boca Juniors, you asked to be waited by Carlos
He makes sure all your needs at the restaurant are provided
the food an service is excelente,i recoment everyone this Espanish food, the Edgar salazar is very friendly and he has a good maner with the costumers, you have a good groop of the employees
Staff is extra friendly and food is good for the price
Where else can yo uget a steak this cheap!?!
Service is pretty bad
I can deal with bad service with good food
My first day my Sirloin steak was very good
Made the way I like it
Second day, my T bone was dry and without any flavor
I was shocked by the inconsistancy
I complained to the waiter about my meat being overcooked, he corrected me saying - meat is just fine
it was not over cooked
I guess I will not be going there to take a chance
In Short Inside this mammoth Times Square restaurant, the dark wood bar is shined to a high polish, and tables dressed in white linens are flanked by leather-upholstered chairs
Gracious waiters rave about the antipasto bar, which promises 40 types of cured meats, seafood, vegetables, and cheeses for patrons to mix and match
Italian-American entrees include steaks, pastas, veal scaloppini, Maine lobster, and thin crust pizza
Cannolis and profiteroles make a sweet finish
My boss is always asking to make reservations to this place
He absolutely loves it and cannot get enough of it
I'm never going back
We had theater tickets, so we decided to try Bond 45, it was close to the theater
What a horrible mistake
The restaurant was very noisy, we had to wait for a table, but that was somewhat understandible
We were finaly seated, the waiter was so rude
He wouldn't go over specials, we couldn't hear him, we just ordered off the menu
I ordered a glass of red wine, he brought me a warm glass of white wine
When I politely asked him to change it, he gave me attitude
The appetizers came together with the enterees and my wine replacement came almost at the end of the meal
It didn't even matter, I had lost my appetite by then anyway
The food was very average
We barely made it for the show
Never going back
We went to Bond 45 in May before the theatre
The service was great
They knew we needed to be out in time to make the show so our server was quick to bring our food
The food is great and the atmosphere is very busy just like the rest of New Year City
Went to Bond 45 last weekend on the advice of a friend and were not disappointed! We didn't have a reservation but arrived early (6:30) and it was no problem
Kyle was our waiter and he gave us some great recommendations for entrees and wine as well as impeccable service
The homemade mozzarella appetizer is amazing - super creamy and rich and the crab cake entree was excellent as well
Everything about our experience was great - we'll be back!
I work in Times Square so we generally take our clients there but after my first time, I've a weekly regular! The appetizers are amazing - the mozzeralla and 7 vegetable platter are musts!
Finally, real Italian in Times Square! My wife and I frequent the theater about once or twice a month, and are always on the look-out for a great pre-theater dinner
We walked by this restaurant and were attracted to the large old looking front with a neon sign and were amazed to find out that it was brand new! From the moment we walked in we were greeted by their friendly staff and felt so welcome
Our food was specatular (DON'T pass up the mozzorela misto) and our waiter was one of the best we've had
One of the managers, I think he was Sicilian, even came over to our table and spoke Sicilian to us! So gracious and warm - go try it and experience Italy in New York!!!!
Not having to rush to the theatre, I made reservations to have a special dinner with my girl only to have the night ruined by the experience at BOND 45
The decor is noteworthy, but that's about all

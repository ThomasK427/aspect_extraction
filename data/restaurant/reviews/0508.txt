No frills to say the least
For my money the best in Brooklyn Heights
Great food - their lunch special s are great and the cheapest food in america
Their sesame chicken is the best on earth
It's a standard Chinese fast food restaurant/take-out place catering to the lunch crowd
The service is decent
The prices are really low, especially their lunch specials
However, you get what you pay for
the food isn't the best and tends to be smothered in sauces to hide that fact
Cathy's place is an old-school coffee shop that offers friendly service and, most importantly, THE CHEAPEST BREAKFAST IN TOWN! For $2
70 (tax included) you get Pancakes, Orange Juice and coffee
The quality is good too
Even if you are not a regular, you will be treated well
I was really impressed with this place
It's sort of out of the way at the end of 4th ave, but it's worth it to go there
The roast pork was possibly the best I've ever had
The won ton soup was great, and the egg roll was crispy without being greasy
The service was strange
I went during lunch and the hostess greeted me with suspicion, why would a guy come at 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon? Service was slow, but in an odd way hurried
They didn't give me a chance to order anything but my entree, so to tell them I wanted an egg roll and a beer, I had to find the waiter and order them separately
Also, even though I was asked twice what kind of rice I wanted, none ever came, and after they dropped my food off, the waiters made themselves scarce
This is the best Chinese food I have ever tasted in Brooklyn
The quality is above the best
I take out from this restaurant at least once a week and have tried everything
The food speaks for itself
I love this place
Yes, they're a bit more expensive then typical, but then again, so is their food
Everything I've ever eaten there (or ordered for home delivery) has been delicious
I highly reccomend the grand marnier shrimp, it's insanely good
The food at Lai Yuen is very good
I've had the Szechuan Lobster, chicken w/ broccoli, and Hong Kong shrimp
All were excellent- though the Szechuan sauce tasted more like General Tso's sauce- but hey, it's lobster- you can't really go wrong
It's a little pricey, but the ambience is nice, the service is good, and the food is great!
It's all about the coffee
amazing! Although the pastries are very nice, too
For a coffee shop this has some of the worst coffee I've had in the city
Its burned to a crisp, unnecessarily hot, and even someone who likes their coffee dark like myself found it too strong
probably from boiling the hell out of the grounds
Coffee and arrogant staff aside the sandwiches are great, the soup has always been good, and its a nice place to kick back and watch the hipsters tragically go on their daily leisure
Just have some tea instead
We spent many summer afternoons in Glechik, coming there right after the beach, a crowd of at least 8-10 people, with kids in tow
Never have we had a problem getting a table and the service has been oustanding despite the spilled drinks, the broken glasses, the kids rummaging under waiters' feet, etc, etc, etc
The food tastes superb, I can't even recommend a dish over the other, because no matter what you take, it's fresh, piping hot and very filling
In the winter, we started a tradition of going there every Friday for dinner, and we often do take out during the week
My kids love this place
I highly recommend it
With three years between visits I was pleasantly surprised that Cafe Glechik is even better than I had remembered
The food is wonderfully memorable and you leave there feeling like you have enjoyed something truly unique, at a price that is reasonable
It should be a stop on anyone's visit to the Coney Island area who is looking for some great food a short walk from the bustling tourist area
Try anything on the menu, but be aware that despite the modest prices the portions are very generous! The stuffed cabbage is outrageously good, and be sure to ask for the fruit drink that seems to be on everyone's table
If you're looking for a terrific, unusual meal that won't damage the bank account, and you're not too concerned about the close quarters seating, this is a wonderful place to try
Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards, but it is cozy and the food is simply GREAT
You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew; salads-all good; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot)
Another great thing about Glechik-everything is very cheap!
Wow, for such an un-assuming place, the treats we had last night were divine!! Reminded me of spreads of turksish and greek snacks we used to get at a lot of great places in London
We had a plate with fresh houmous (best houmous I've had since moving to NYC), babaganoush, tabouleh, black bean, and grape leaves, with fresh warm pita
And we shared the olive vine pizza which was to-die-for
Deliciously fresh veggies, a touch of mozzerella, fresh herbs and hints of cilantro; and great sauce
I can't wait to go back! And such reasonable prices too
yum
It was my first time there
The food was so yummy; I had the chicken plate and it was so fresh and tasty
It was cheap, comparing it to other middle eastern places
The staff were so friendly and always smiling
I kept asking the cute guy behind the counter to get me stuff, since the waiter was a little busy, and he did with huge smile on his face every time i asked him for something
I am definitely going back there
Before i forget, the back yard is so huge and beautiful
not only is the food hella cheap, it's hella good
to top it off, the service is wonderful
who would've ever thought that one could receive service with a smile in new york city?? the pita bread is always made fresh (not like some others that taste store-bought)
the lentil soup is amazing, and one of my favourites is the pizza, which i always get with fresh tomatoes
a definite must for anyone residing in brooklyn
and for everyone else for that matter
More than a pizza place
Undertones of the middle-east abound
Most of the non-pizza selections on the menu include pita-bread, humous or falafel in some combination or other
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin
The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad
The falafal was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine
No alcohol license so youll have to take your own wine if you want to drink with your meal, otherwise its the mint tea or water that are offered by the establishment
We elected not to have a desert but were presented with a tasty, small sweet-cornbread-like sample of desert in any case, on the house
The main draw of this place is the price
Its cheap
So for a filling and healthy meal give it a go
Simple healthy unglamorous food cheap
In Short This small neighborhood favorite is the definition of cozy with its tiny Formica tables, ever-changing artwork and dropped tin ceiling
Up front, a large bay window provides a basement view of the neighborhood; at the rear, the tiny open kitchen serves up a limited variety of dishes: fish and chips, Thai chicken and hamburgers with caramelized onions all co-exist without any concerns about culinary common ground
the food is consistently great! i had the salmon for the first time tonight and it was better than some seafood restaurants i've been to
i've had practically everything on their menu as i dine out alot but their burgers and mussels with fries are what bring me there every friday night
the servers are always pleasant and even charming at times
And where else in this ever changing neighboorhood can you still gather with your friends for a great meal and a glass of wine for $20 or under? and now they take credit cards!
I've worked in food service and I'm pretty forgiving especially when the server is busy
Today was surreal
The waitress actually gave me a dirty look when I asked for another cup of coffee and then kept walking without saying anything and never came back to the table! Never! Our food took about 40 minutes and she never came back to the table
When the food did come it was great, as always
I had to shout to get the check because she refused to make eye contact with anyone at our table
She smiled and nodded and twenty minutes later we still didn't have the check!? It was amazing
It was like she wanted us to walk out on the bill and not tip
We did neither of those things, but I've never been so tempted
Wonderful atmosphere, sexy french staff and the yummiest food around

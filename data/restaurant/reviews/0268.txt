I am very disappointed
A month ago I celebrated my 25th Birthday at Rainbow Room
We all went for Sunday brunch
The wait staff is terrible
They were very rude and snotty
It is very sad that a restaurant with such great view has to be such a disappointment
Very disappointed at the lack of customer service associated with such an accredited name
From the managers down to the staff
Downright sad!
We had a 1:30 lunch reservation
It was a 10 min
wait to be seated
The noise level was deafening,staff was sterile aloof,prices outrageous for lunch/lack of quality
Food delivered server turned heel and left without a word
Upon leaving and making complaint of overall extreme unhappiness, hostess looked blankly and had little to say,conveying also her own lack of caring
Forget the instructions not to wear jeans-we saw many
We wouldn't return if it were free
The treatment and cafeteria like atmosphere was heartbreaking
After reading reviews, I thought this place would have mediocre to poor quality food
I was wrong
The food was actually quite delicious
The view and atmosphere contributed to the fine dining to be expected at this elegant eatery
Service had a lot to be desired
It took 10 minutes for our menus to arrive and 20 minutes to take our order
I had to flag them down for service, and I mean really flag them down
The perfect word for this is snooty
Dress like a billionaire and you will probably get serviced
Dress like a millionaire and you will be ignored with extreme prejudice
I kid you not!
Never in my life have I had such bad service
Despite the expensive drinks ($18 Baily's Irish Cream, $14 for Vodka Cranberry), the waiters act and look like they were taken off the streets and thrown into uniforms
One waiter came by and literally threw the $36 salad on the table
My date and I were stunned as we hadn't ordered it
The waiter then came back with our waiter and looked at us as if it was our fault and in complete disgust
When I said something to our waiter about the incident, he shrugged his shoulders and said, I'm as surprised as you
We wouldn't have minded the prices, if the place had had some class
Patrons were falling out their seats and some even had jeans on
The allure and elegance of the Rainbow Room is long gone
Left behind is a tacky, over-rated tourist trap
The rainbow room, with its jackets required policy, is really a thrwback to the days when having a fun night on the town meant DANCING
There are some real characters on the dance floor at the Rainbow room, and just watching them dance to the lovely tunes of the live band can be entertainment in itself
Of course, that is if you get tired of the spectacular views of Manhattan that the top floor of the GE building offers
Of course, with such incredible ambiance, comes great expense
You can undoubtedly get better food and service for the price at other places, but certainly not with those views!
TERRIBLE We made a 10:00reservation and were seated at 10:40
We had to wait until the matre de finished fighting with people who decided to leave because of the awful service (we were told to 'hold on' while the maitre di talked back to these guests)we sat, bread was slammed on the table without plates, our order was demanded
Our table was right next to a computer, where we had the luxury of listening staff argue all night
We received our food, and it was, and I mean this-THE WORST FOOD I HAVE EVER EATEN!And there was no manager-we were told he walked out
After all this,we had to sit for 30 minutes, I went up to the waiter at the computer and asked for our check
We were in such a hurry to leave, it wasn't until today I looked at the receipt and noticed we were wrongly charged
PLEASE DO NOT GO THERE
Food here was terrible! I can do better at home! $40 for dry tasteless food! BLECH- just go for the view and drinks
From the careless and lethargic hostess and wobbly catering tables to the overcooked lobster and tacky tv projection of the 4th of July fireworks spectacular (why? wasn't the view of it enough???), we were very disappointed by this experience and feel the need to warn New Yorkers to avoid the Rainbow Room because it is truly a tourist attraction and a bad one at that
Some places are not timeless
I took my mom to the Sunday brunch yesterday, and after reading the reviews on this sight, I was VERY nervous! Good thing I ignored it and went anyway
This was the best time I've had in my life! Amazing food, perfect service, and fabulous view! I will definitely be back with my boyfriend
Everyone had a sincere smile on their face, sweet dispositions, and the buffet was to die for! If you plan on going, please disregard the negative comments you've read, they're not true!I would rate it an 11 if I could!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A wonderful view, no doubt, but is it really worth the price? Six of us visited recently and for a single cocktail each, the bar bill without tip was $170
Dinner was very good though I have to say that I have eaten in much better, less expensive restaurants in NYC and didn't come out feeling as cheated as I did when I left this establishment
Rainbow is very nice but make sure someone else is lifting the tab! or you find a pot of gold before you go in!
The view is the reason to go to this restaurant, not the food nor the service
The view is one of the best in Manhattan!
We went for brunch about a month ago and were very fortunate to be seated at a window facing north over Central Park
I still can't decide which I enjoyed more, the food or the view
For around $50 per person for brunch, it was a great value and the food really was fantastic
go for a special occasion, look pretty, eat well
and look out the window all night long
The setting is fantastic on a clear evening - there is nothing like eating dinner looking out over Manhattan! However, for between $35 to $40 and entree, we expected a lot more than the plain looking bland food we were served! Save your appetite (and money) for the desserts - they're worth it!
I went for the fixed price lunch, and the most outstanding part was the atrocious service! It beat out even the views
The food was truly delicious and of course the views are self-evident
But the service, from the rude maitre d' to the bumbling busboys to the inattentive waiter, was truly appalling
It took an hour for our main course to arrive
They brought dessert without the utensils or coffee (nice to look at, and we did get to eat it after asking twice for a fork)
It's like no one there knows what they are doing
Also, as lovely as the views are, during lunch time the temp in the restaurant was easily 85 or 90 degrees! Hard to enjoy
Tacky decor, but with the skyline view, who cares
Prices may take your breath away more than the view, but THIS is quintessential New York, even down to the disinterested staff
I recently visited the Rainbow Grill with friends for drinks and dinner and my experience was far from enjoyable
Not only was the food bland but the service that our table received was absolutely disgraceful! Whoever is in charge of hiring and training the staff should be fired! Our waiter and captain were extremely rude with their comments, sloppy and unprofessional with their service
As a customer paying their prices, I expected their service to be top-notch
Instead I was extremely disappointed and appalled that the Rainbow Grill hires such ill-mannered staff to serve its customers
For anyone who wants to try this DISGRACE of a restaurant, I recommend going somewhere else for the money because it isn't worth a dime!
Went to Rainbow Room for an after work drink after a stressful day
We were seated at the bar so we asked for a table instead
We were told there were none available (when there were at least 4 that were empty)
When we noticed that other people that were walking in were being seated at the tables we asked some older man who was completely rude
He said he could not seat us at the now 2 available tables because we had already started a tab at the bar
Huh? We asked if we could move before we ordered our drinks from the bar! If someone is willing to spend $17 to $20 on one drink, you would think they would be treated with some respect
Guess not
Will never return to the Rainbow Room
Very romantic and elegant
In the rainbow room you can see a great view of the city
I recently went to Metsovo with my boyfriend and another couple - what a perfect place to start a fun night
The portions were generous and the food was great
Avgolemono soup, warm spinach salad, Arta style chicken, Dandelion Pie, whole fish and marinated porterhouse steak all offer a very high quality of flavor, preparation, and presentation
The waiter was very knowledgeable about the food but especially the wine
We picked one out and he described it perfectly, which I have often found rare
Can't say more than excellent and will be back for more!
What a fantastic evening! We took my mother to Metsovo to celebrate her 70th b-day
Our group of 6 was treated wonderfully- perfect service, delicious food and the best wine

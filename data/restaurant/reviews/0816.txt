However, don't be fooled by the wide selection
If you're determined to test out the best cuisine, Tuk Tuk is it
There are other restaurants in the neighborhood that are trendier, more well known (a
k
a
chain restaurants), but Tuk Tuk blows them all out of the water with regards to culinary expertise
I live in the neighborhood, LOVE Thai food, have tried them all and believe me, I ain't lyin'! Watch out for the spicy curries, though
You might think you can handle spicy food, but you most likely cannot handle what Tuk Tuk's kitchen considers to be spicy
Word
this place
we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend
whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices
even the wine by the glass was good
its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are
The food was OK - not the best Thai in the city, but not the worst
The jazz band that played the last time we were there was a bit loud and our table quickly got tired of trying to talk over the music
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC, it's wonderful, and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights
Authentic food and they have REAL service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door
Live relaxed Jazz just tops it off ;]  Enjoy
This place is pretty cool to eat in
Nice seating arrangement for you to take in every visual the spot has to offer
I came twice, once with a couple folks, and the other time with a group of seven
Both times, my friends enjoyed themselves
Strangely enough, thye were playing HIP-HOP music (I listened to Kanye West's ENTIRE second album while eating)
The food service took a while (more time than I would considre appropriate), but the food is really decent
Let's face it
For some odd reason, Williamsburg really lacks sushi restaurant
Of course, there is Miyako, which I highly rate, but the only inconvenience of that place is that they don't deliever
One night, we couldn't find delievery menu for another sushi place, so we decided to order from Spot
For the food we were getting, it was over priced, as much as some of the high end Sushi place in Manhattan
I knew at a first taste, that I'd never give this place another chance
I consider rice is the most important part of sushi, but obviously, they didn't know it enough
All the other ingridients they use really wasn't impressive
Yeah, they have $13 all you can eat sushi special when dine, unless one's most desperate to fill their stomach up some low grade sushi, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone
i first discovered this little place last year when i moved to williamsburg
the all you can eat sushi roll special is the best deal in the metro area, eventhough they hiked the price a couple bucks since it's gotten so popular
most people think brooklyn's too far from the city for dinner, but once they visit spot they can't help but come back!
In Short Among the many bakeries of Chelsea Market, this one distinguishes itself with a vast display of cakes, many of them sculpted and decorated for special occasions
Strawberry shortcake, red velvet, marble cheesecake and lemon mousse tempt alongside macaroons, cannoli, and "grandma's recipe" rugelach
Colorful stand-up cakes of SpongeBob, Elmo and wedding dresses offer a glimpse into the possibilities, while self-serve coffee and counter add a touch of comfort
this is the second year i'm getting my bday cake from ruthy's
their strawberry shortcake is the best! a small cake has fed 20-25 starving college students
I've never eaten there
excellent delivery service!
I'm not the type to tip toe around with words, so let me just get to the point
The appetizer's were ok however the entrees were a train wreck, the service was horrible
the waiters were slower than molasses rolling down a hill on a cold snowy day, and as far as being romantic
FORGET IT, unless you find 2 woman arm wrestling and carrying on as if they were in a sports bar romantic
You may go one time to this restaurant(because you think this review is untrue) but i can guarantee you wont go a second time
I love everything about this place - the food, the service, the music, the ambiance, the owner, the bar - this what NY is all about
I get back to ALEO's (from Virginia) several times every year and I'm never disappointed
The shrimp risotto and the halibut are my favorites
If you have time, stay late and get to know the owner, Pete
As another reviewer stated, this is what NYC is all about!
My date and I truly enjoyed ALEO
The service is energetic and dedicated
The people are more than helpful from seating us to helping with the wine and desserts
The food was extremely flavorful, and quite varied
A little more than your typical Italian NYC restaurant
The cost was even more quite mild considering the neighborhood
We are planning our rehearsal dinner here since we were so impressed
Had a nice meal at Aleo
The food was good but not inspired
Everything was cooked well and tastes were good just not wow
Service was amateurish--had to keep asking waitress to not fill wine glasses so high up but she seemed puzzled by this
Another couple moved tables because it was so dark where they were--and they didn't even try lighting the candle on the table first
Wine list is long enough but average labels and vintages
Prices were again fair however
Oddly disconcerting and somewhat loud Italian covers of american pop music playing and a bar with a TV which faces the seating areas didn't add to the ambience
Garden in back looks nice but it was too cold to sit out
Would stop in again with toned down expectations
Living around the flatiron-gramercy district I have frequented Aleo on a number of occasions and in a number of capacities
I have gone there on a date, and the owner is so nice and the waitstaff is so welcoming my date thought that I owned the place (needless to say the date went well and ended well), I have gone in with some friends for a couple of drinks and appetizers before going out in the Meatpacking District and that was great, I have been in on business lunches the service is always mindful of my daily agenda
I love Aleo's and this place always makes me happy
service was very attentive and especially from warm welcome and attention from mangaer was impressive
food was like homecooked meal
gnocchi was especially melting in your mouth
Lingiui was perfectly cooked with subtle, yet great flavor sauce
would definitely go back
price was very decent, which is always important factor for choosing resataurant
we had reservations, were sat quickly
food arrived over an hour after we were seated
Food was cold and bland
We had to chase down the waiter to order and refresh our drinks
for the $150 bill, a diner would've done just fine
ambiance was nice - we had a nice cozy corner table, that was about the only good thing about this restraunt
with bad service, cold food, there isnt much reason to visit again
Food was good, but for the price of a plate of pasta here, four raviolis doesn't cut it as an entre for a big guy
In spite of a great tuna tartare and a wonderful salad, I left hungry
Staff was attentive, service was great, atmosphere was nice and I'm sure that the garden is a wonderful spot in the summer
As a November diner, I left a little cold
Pietro's smile (the last thing I saw as I left) can warm you up, though
I dig that he named the joint after his parents and shows up on the scene
Pete from Chicago
Are you kidding me
Where have I been??? This place ia amazing
It is a hidden gem in Chelsea/Gramercy
Pictures of Sinatra on the wall as soon as you walk in, then black and whites of the owners parents (who the restaurant seems to be named for)

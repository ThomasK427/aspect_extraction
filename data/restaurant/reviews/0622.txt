My favorites are the turkey meatloaf and the beet fries
They also have a great brunch - I love the turkey bacon with the poached eggs and jalepeno aioli
My significant other, a vegan, likes the TBLT
They are sooo creative here!
I am not a vegetarian, but the food here is amazing and cheap
This is a great freakin' restaurant, with mucho choices for vegetarians meat-eaters alike
Cool ambiance, great place to chow before or after a show at Irving
The Beggar's Purse is the best damn dessert I've had a long time! Woo! (Now if only their drinks weren't so pricey
)
Girls' weekend this weekend and we hit several spots around the city
Went here after a show on Saturday night and ordered 4 different items off the menu
We barely ate any of them
Food was not worth eating (avoid the humus especially)


and the service was rather slow
The food here is great with a very eclectic menu which includes things from black rice to freshly squeezed lemonade
You must also try the calamari!   The bar is well stocked
The service is freindly and prompt
I've been a regular @ Galaxy for several years and I've never been disappointed by the food
The waitresses are usually quite lovely, and the food is even better! The food seems to be kind of a pan-asian diner mix, and there's quite a selection
These guys have some weird obsession with hemp
Check out the Galaxy burger-- it's cooked with some spices and seasoning, giving it some unique (and excellent) flavor
There's so a nice collection of galaxy special drinks
Give the place a try-- it's just steps from Union Sq
The Scene Chintzy Victorian wallpaper covers one wall, psychedelic patterns decorate another and massive chandeliers--minus crystals, plus bare bulbs--hang above elevated dining platforms
Despite the dizzying decor, tableware is sleek, service is slick and the "Sex and the City" look-alikes seem happy to endure long waits at the front bar
The Food Chef and co-owner Andy D'Amico interprets Nice's breezy Mediterranean cuisine with more style than sophistication, and the crowds applaud
Take the fun track with inexpensive hors d'oeuvres like garlicky grilled merguez, leeks vinaigrette and rouille-doused poached mussels
Don't skip the pissaladiere--a caramelized onion Nicoise pizza with an herb-y, anchovy-olive kick
Simple, long-cooked beef daube is a beautiful thing, but fussier dishes, like stringy rabbit ravioli, and meagerly portioned, fishy roast cod, flop
The gooey Gruyere-onion burger, its aged beef slathered with aioli, is reason enough to return
Brunched here on a few sundays
Small but lovely sidewalk cafe
Great food and service! The Belgian waffles are the lightest and crispiest on earth! :)
Wanted to try someplace new
So what better way to try out a restaurant than during restaurant week
If restaurant week is a way to drum up business and to lure me back again then Nice Matin surely failed
The prix fixe menu was uninspired and LAZY
I had artic char, which came out cold and came back luke warm
Even the sauce- fennel and mussel couldn't save it
My husband had the risotto- which was hot and well done
Way overpriced
I know 35
00 is not expensive but the very least they could have done was add a small dollop of potato or a green bean to the lonely little piece of char
Fresh fruit for dessert with a nano-scoop of lavender ice cream finished off the meal
and don't get me started about the bread, my husband asked for a piece of each kind of bread(2) they were offering and was given the two tiniest pieces in the basket
Is bread being rationed??? The 125
we spent would have been a much better meal somewhere else
Also, they were really trying to turn tables
The over anxious busboys had to be shooed away from our plates and drinks
Our conversation was interrupted every 5 minutes ( No exaggeration) to tell someone we weren't done yet
Sorry, won't be returning
We chose to ignore the reviews about service - and that was a mistake
The service was terrible, and not just for us but for just about every table I could see
The food was only OK - for these prices you can find somewhere else that is better
The one thing I will say is that the wine list is impressive, and so is the wine service - and the bar scene seemed pretty fun
So drink/dine at the bar if you feel you must go here
My boyfriend and I have been enjoying Nice Matin for a while now -- the only con is the service
They will seat you in strange spots, make you wait and even act patronizing toward you
That said, the food is fabulous and the prices are just right!
The hace a great steak
Great service
My favorite restaurant
We live in the neighborhood and were looking forward to another great addition to our stable of regular restaurants
But alas, it wasn't meant to be
Although the Bloody Mary's are great and food is generally OK, the service is bottom of the barrell
Requests for things like ketchup and more water regularly unanswered
On one visit, (we've given them about five chances), we had to ask no fewer than 3 different people for condiments
And this was after waiting over 40 minutes for our food to arrive
For these kinds of prices, service should be adequate and not neglectful
The good: despite not having a reservation on a busy, rainy Saturday night, the hostesses had us seated within 20 minutes
After that it was all downhill
The service here was awful
We were treated rudely and dismissively by our waiter, who seemed more interested in having a ten minute conversation about his college with the table next to us, while empty appetizer trays and drink glasses piled up
The food was no better than okay, and certainly did not justify the prices charged for the meal
The whole place reeked of snobbery, quite frankly - if you weren't ordering more than $200 worth of food, they weren't going to treat you like a decent customer
Not worth your money, or your time
There are other French places worth your investment
highly recommended for a excellent meal without all the fuss! Call ahead for a reservation because neighborhood locals pop-in and some nights it can be busseling, but they doorstaff accomidates walk-ins as promptly as possible (it's not their fault no one wants to leave the place)
The servers are excellent; friendly and eager to please as well as knowledgable of the food and wines
Great for after-work, a first date, a casual bite, before or after a show or anytime you want a great meal!
There are few things about eating out that can get me really angry
I'm very tolerant of mistakes in orders, spills, etc
What really sets me off is when the host staff doesn't follow any rational criteria for seating and doesn't respect the time of people who have been waiting longer
I arrived and put my name on the list and was told that we would have to wait about 10 minutes
Three parties who arrived subsequent to me, who I saw put their names in after I did, were seated before us; all three were larger than mine, and there were many empty tables
Despite my loud statement of that observation in front of their station, there was no acknowledgment or apology forthcoming
The waiter was actually quite good and almost made up for it, but this was infuriating; I am definitely spreading the word about this nonsense
I've been twice for breakfast, and both times I've been pleased
Warning: they use alot of butter, but they have some healthier options as well
The ambience is beautiful, however, it feels like you're in the spotlight while you dine
Overall, though, the food is quite good, and we will return
Johnny Walker on the rocks with a stalk of celery, my new favoret drink
You gotta love the bartenders at this place
I was looking for a new drink and I love Scotch, so the bar tender told me about this drink
As simple as it seem it the stalk of celery really makes a difference in the oakieness of the Scotch
I was surprised I hadn't known it all along because he told me it's been around for about 10 years maybe longer
I asked him if I used Johnny Walker Blue in it would it be to rich to be called a stalker, he told me if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it's a duck
I love this place

And and this early on a Sunday evening when there were no crowds
All in all what a disappointment for native New Yorkers with southern (S
C
)roots
Although I love the food here, there is one waiter in particular who is horrible
We got there at 8pm and didnt get served untill 930
The waiter never came over to our table, screwed up the order and one of us got frozen mashed potatos
The food is good, when its hot, but the service is retarded slow!!!!
While I love the food at this place, I remember the service took a really long time the last two times I visited
It took the waiter over 30 minutes to get our food because the order was misplaced
Also, when I ordered for take-out on another incident, that took 30 minutes too! I don't know if it is because they are understaffed or too busy, but expect to wait a long time to eat here
I've been living in Harlem for nearly a year, but I only made it to Miss Mamie's for the first time last week
I was expecting a lot, since the place is supposedly legendary and consistently wins awards
Well, imagine my surprise at finding the service frigid and the food rather unextraordinary
The much-touted macaroni and cheese was less flavorful than a box of Kraft, and the fried chicken paled in comparison to KFC
The collard greens were fine, however, and I'll concede that the sweet potato pie was worth returning for
Unfortunately, I tried their famous peach cobbler several days later, and found it was on par with the macaroni
One thing I will say about Miss Mamie's: this place is cheap
Entrees (with two sides) average about $12- a good value, even in Harlem
But is it really worth it for average food and downright rude service?
This is a place I can (and sometimes do) eat at several times a week
I love soul food and Miss Mamie's does it well
Some of the best MacCheese in the city!!! The smothered chicken was excellent as well
We ordered delivery the other night and it was still an excellent experience which says a lot of for a good place! The staff is very friendly and relaxed as well!
This place rocks! The atmosphere is slightly divey but perfect
I got the sampler platter (pork/beef ribs, fried chicken, fried catfish or shrimp, plus 3 sides
I had Mac n cheese, stringbeans, and french fries)
The beef ribs are amazing, pork ones are also good, fried catfish was delicious, fried chicken excellent, mac n cheese to die for, perfect french fries, and nothing-special green beans
For dessert, we had banana pudding, buttercream cake, and peach cobbler
The banana pudding was really good (but Ive had better), the buttercream cake was also really good (but it didnt excite me that much for some reason), and the peach cobbler was awful! Canned peaches (I know its not peach season), too much nutmeg, and a bad taste
Id definitely try another fruit cobbler there, but only during fruit season
Even with that bad dish, Id still come back here any day
Its excellent!
I had the sampler which included chicken, pork and beef ribs, catfish, and three sides($15
95)
The cornbread was scrumptious! Getting this entree made me feel like I was doing a buffet
able to try several items
My mother-in-law in eastern North Carolina cooks the best soul food anywhere and my husband (her baby) found Miss Mamie's to be good
That means alot
Our waiter was very impassive and seemed to have the personality of a stinkbug, but we got over it
Another server was quite helpful
I first went to Mamie's when my family visited from out of town
We were a large group, but the wait staff did an excellent job of accommodating us
The food was DELICIOUS and plentiful! Being from New Orleans, we know good food and this was it! Recently, my boyfriend and I went for a second visit and we were just as pleased
Once again
I felt like I had cooked it myself (and I'm a pretty good cook!) except that I didn't have to do the dishes! :o)
From the best fried chicken in town, juicy and crisp, seasoned just right, to the short ribs of beef, falling off the bone with fresh cooked collard greens and the best marinated potato salad
ummmmmmmm good
Do not pass it up, go by for early dinner 7 days a week
The Upper West Side locals know a good thing in the Broadway Restaurant
Students, musicians and other neighborhood folk add to the city atmosphere
And
I'd swear the OJ (included w/ breakfast) is not from concentrate!
This place has the best veggie burger in the city
They take a fresh veggie patty with chickpeas and lentils and deep fry it
It's not good for you, but it sure is great
Be warned, this is a Pepsi restaurant
In Short A dozen or so wall lamps offer low reading light for students who come to this comfortable, old-style campus coffee shop
There can't be too many places left in New York that serve dobos torte--nine layers of yellow cake and chocolate buttercream standing tall on a plank of mahogany caramel--and rigo janci, a Hungarian-style chocolate mousse
But they're both here, along with hamantaschen, linzer torte, sacher torte and Black Forest cake
This is the only place left in Manhattan to get authentic Hungarian sour cherry strudel - the best!
By far my favorite place on the upper west side
Perfect place to go sit, read, talk, and drink great coffee all day (free refils - yay!)
The incredible plain croissants are soft, so buttery, and come with a tiny paper cup of apricot jam
The hot chocolate is also a stand-out, and their other pastries are all well above average
Go when the weather's nice and sit outside, where you'll get the perfect view of the Cathedral of St
John the Divine
Great coffee, great laid back atmosphere, great pastries
I stumbled upon this bakery as I initially planned on going somewhere else
I was pleased with the prices
Very reasonable
Not to many places in NYC where $1
80 gets you unlimited refills
I had a slice of carrot cake for $3
25
Was disappointed that it was quite dry
Frosting was excellent though
Also liked the idea that you could buy single cookies for $0
35 and not nescessarily by the lb
Tried a few and was very pleased
Ample seating
Would go again
The style of pastries and variety of Eastern European style pastries, particularly the Sacher Torte, make this place stand out from a lot of the other places that offer baked goods
You will find better desserts at the Hotel Sacher in Vienna, but they're not worth the cost of the airplane tickets
As for this place, it's good food for a reasonable price, and something a little different from what you get most of the time in New York
Definitely head up and try the place if you can
wonderful little shop featuring great coffee and an assortment of delicious pastries
The dark interior is usually full of studying college students and others enjoying some reading (how they do so in the dim lighting, I dunno), so it can be hard getting a table
Patio outside is usually full too
Next door to a gelato shop though
The croissants are huge and especially good when you get them warm
The coffee is pretty good too and the prices are great! As for the other pastries, depends what you get
(I wasn't thrilled with my apply turnover)
Not much of a place as far as atmosphere is concerned, but its a nice place to study (studying students tend to take up whole tables which means seating can be limited)
A good place to meet for a quiet coffee or to just relax and read the paper
The Scene The Heights, located a stone's throw from Columbia, is a classic student hangout featuring cheap drinks and loud conversation
Large windows usher in breezes while students cluster around the bar drinking frozen margaritas in a rainbow of flavors
Up a steep flight of stairs is the charming, intimate rooftop
The Food The mostly Mexican menu offers a wide array of inexpensive burritos, burgers, salads and sandwiches
Queso fundido is a cheese lover's dream, but snap it up quick, before it becomes too hard to scoop

Clearly they are not familiar with what good Indian food is supposed to taste like
The service was unbelievably bad
The wait for a table is interminable
There is no understanding of the concept of a resevation
The drinks are overpriced
There is not enough room in the waiting area, considering how long you have to wait
And the management and owner are so ridiculously rude when we complained I was enraged
For REAL South Indian food, i would suggest going to Lexington and 27th or Jackson Heights in Queens
It's a trek but you will have the best Indian food in New York without any of the attitude
excellent restaurant, extraordinary service extremely friendly staff
we went here as a group of 10 for my sisters bachelorette party it was simply some of the best indian food i've ever had
their garlic nan is unbelievable
definately check it out
The food was awesome, and the service was also great
I wish they would bring back their dosa dish
it was to die for
The Scene A dusky, subdued spot on leafy Bleecker Street, Miracle West is almost too tastefully understated
The well-stocked bar is appropriately against the back wall of the first room, and there's a separate room off to the side devoted to dining
The Southwestern tchotchkes--quaint but unmemorable--are placed at discreet intervals on the warmly-hued walls, and the tables are artfully positioned just far enough apart for comfort
Service is pleasant, though sometimes a trifle too unhurried
The Food Miracle makes no visible claims to rigid authenticity, and its adventures in fusion can be charming
Take the Asian-inflected, ginger-sparked julienned cabbage--unexceptional when it stuffs the spring rolls, it accompanies the catfish tacos appetizer to greater effect
More straightforward entrees--strip steak, enchiladas--often achieve an elegant, flavorful simplicity
But a few baroquely mischievous dishes succeed extravagantly--the fried chicken salad is a dieter's guilty Kentucky-fried pleasure and the sumptuous banana split transcends regionalism
Wonderfully Eclectic Southwestern without the Mundane Enchilada
Last week my friend and I walked around and around the Village looking for a nice restaurant, had appies at Monster Sushi and decided to return to Miracle Grill we passed along the way
We had a wonderful Server named Simone and the atmosphere although loud was very intimate
We had the feeling we were the only diners
Our food was delicious and cooked to perfection
We are returning tonight for a Birthday and can't wait to savor more selections
We liked the bar the last time, but did not partake
Would recommend if your single to stay for a drink
I was told everything on the menu was worth trying at least once
I picked the salmon I was not disappointed
very light tasty
the service was attentive, too! Comfortable neighborhood
Plan to go back!
This unassuming little place has now become my favorite eatery in New York City
Its fun, its cozy, it has energy--its busy yet you can talk---it is alive! The food is great
Yes it is GREAT! No matter what I have tried, its always delicious--and there's always plenty of it
The waitstaff is top notch without getting in the way of your evening
The drinks!! Try the Jackie O!! While there are hundreds of places to eat in the city, I keep going back here because I know I won't be disappointed
I know I'll have fun, I'll eat well and I'll get a great value
My husband and I eat here often, sometimes once a week (always when our favorite hostess is working) and we keep coming back
We prefer the quieter back room and I ALWAYS get the catfish tacos - so delicious
It can get a bit noisy as the evening grow later, but sometimes that's part of the fun
We usually see large parties having a great time
Admittedly, I used to love this place
But since the menu has been revised, there are no longer free salsa and chips (now priced on the menu), and some of the items I used to enjoy have been re-done
It no longer feels like a special place
Cocktails are still very good, and the East Village location has nice outdoor seating in back
But still, there are plenty of other options
We went on a friday night proably around 10:30 and it was really fun! The drinks were excellent (especially the blood-orange margarita), and the food was too
had the chips and guac (which was a little lacking in flavor) and then the veggie quesadillas which were excellent
Other friends had fish and then a burger, which also looked good
The atmosphere is what i would describe as a little granola-ish
a little bit alterna and nature-esque, but nevertheless it was a fun meal
We were ridiculous and had them split the bill on seven(!) credit cards, and they were very accomodating! I would definitely recommend it!
I've eaten here many times
The lobster empanadas and catfish tacos are to die for
organized a bachelorette party dinner here recently
we were 26 crazy ladies and they handled us amazingly!! the food was GREAT and they kept the drinks a'flowin! even more, they couldn't have been nicer about the entire thing
AND it was a great deal! i HIGHTLY recommend this restaurant on all counts
great meals and great times out of the 20 or so times i've eaten there in the last year
i love eating at this place
the mojitos are amazing
bravo!
Miracle Grill is a great restaurant to go to if you're hungry and trying to think of a place at the last minute
It's never too crowded and it's always friendly
They serve DELICIOUS margaritas
The quesadillas are a nice appetizer
The salsa is fresh, but needs more flavor
A little bland
The filet mignon is nicely done with potato string fries
The chicken fajitas are decent
nothing spectacular
Overall, it's a nice place
decent place to hang out for a casual tex-mex meal with friends
everything about this place is done with a certain style, but not with any real skill or inspiration
I tried their evening special, which was a fresh fish inundated in about 8 different sauces and surrounded in as many vegetables, so it was more confusing to the palate rather than pleasing
it's a nice enough neighborhood hangout, or a good place to go on the spur of the moment since they don't take reservations for less than a group of six
we sat in the back room, which was a little darker and quieter than the front bar/room, but there was a good, social energy to the entire space
I'm not sure what the problem with service is here
I've only been twice, but both times the waiters and hostess were nice, attentive and quick
The food is fantastic, the pork chops are huge and the Tilapia special we had was incredible
Beat the crowds and go early in the week
I had 2 great aps: tortilla spring rolls and the calamari both excellent and I had the fish of the day which was the Yellow Fin Tuna, excellent as well as a very good chocolate desert
Great Martinis as well
I have eaten at the Miracle Grill on Bleecker many times and never been disappointed
The food is fabulous, the waitstaff is friendly and attentive, the ambience is comfortable and simple, and the red desert margaritas are out of this world! I have taken almost all my friends there, and they have loved it as well
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves good tex-mex
I have had several good experiences here
The food is better than your average pasta house and the prices are more than reasonable
Its a cute place in a great location and is open late
The Scene Despite its supremely generic name, The Place is an intimate restaurant full of comfy touches like wood beams, stone walls, multiple fireplaces and a cozy bar
Warm candlelight fills the room, which feels vaguely like a Greek grotto
The Food Chef William Stroby cooks inflected comfort food, featuring entrees such as grilled leg of lamb with new potatoes and haricot verts in a rosemary jus, braised beef short ribs with horseradish and mashed potatoes, and a spiced fish stew
For a quick bite, settle in at the bar and order some tapas, all of which pair beautifully with the selection of South African and Chilean wines
Ok
Imagine this, a first date

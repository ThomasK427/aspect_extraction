Service was very quick and the waitstaff were very attentive people, and very customer-oriented without being too pushy unlike some Indian restaurants
A definite try
Howsoever Im little bit familiar with the Indian food, even though it makes me hard to pick up where to get in
6th street the whole row of Indian foods
it makes me suck
Then I saw a small cozy nicely decorated one restaurant named spice cove, the name and the place is pretty much matched
The statues on the wall, the rocks, waterfalls, the deemed lights with candles
oh yeah and the food is so delicious that the flavor of spicesmind blowing still I can feel it
And the service so worthygood job
Wait staffs are so friendly
And the prices are very reasonable
I came to this place for a couple of times with new friends and it seems that most of my friends enjoyed at this place! The flavor of the food was always consistent and the staff were so attentive that we're really impressed! Not like any other indian rest
that we've been,everything seems perfect! It's really a nice place to bring new friends and for a get together without tearing out your pockets
Just make sure you make a reservation to avoid the crowd as the place is too small
I went to Spice Cove on a Sunday with three friends
What a great experience! The service, food, and ambience were great
We had the $9
95 prix fixe, which is available Sunday thru Thursday
The tomato lentil soup was zesty, the vegetable samosa had a nicy flaky crust, and my main entree (lamb curry) was presented beautifully on the plate
The ambience was simple and elegant
Spice Cove is a good place to have a nice meal and enjoy conversation with friends
Heard about this place from my friend and I must say I love it! The place is romantic and the food is good
At least the waiter there were not rude like some of the other rest
that I've been
Now I know about this place, I will definetly come back when I come to 6st
One of NYC'S most sophisticated dining spot just might be this oh-so-romantic restaurant, tucked in the hideway of Lower East Side
The interior design makes you gapped in awe! and you'll see that it's one of the best architecturally
The idea of this contemporary cuisine shows throughout the atmosphere and the food presentation is just so beautiful
Try their special's like the spiced mussels which is infused with cardammon and coconut flavor, makes you coming back for more! Their Chicken Tikka Masala was the BEST! compare to any other Indian restaurant you could find on 6st
They uses only the most authentic spices and herbs to make this robust flavor in the dishes
Overall, it's affordable,beautiful atmosphere and a nice place to bring your first date without breaking your pockets!
My friend and I recently went to Spice Cove after hearing of its opening 1 month ago
The space was cozy and well decorated
The waitstaff was attentive and friendly
When I asked for spicy I got spicy! I have been to almost all of the restaurants on E 6th street and this is by far the best experience I have had
Anyone looking for a good value and a quiet, quaint atmosphere will find it in Spice Cove
happy eating
Try there a couple time and the food is very good
Decor and ambience is impressive
The music and candle sure make it kind of romantic
Service is okay
Nice place to eat if you like indian food
I believe they just open and offering free red wine as a promotion
There special is spiced mussel, coconut shrimp, and fish filet
I just went there on Valentines with my date and we are very satisfied! From the outside
you can obviously see that this place is not like any other Indian restaurant
I have to admit that we are just as impressed as we stepped inside
The atmosphere is great! Cosy, romantic, warm
even their restroom got me a little excited!! Mostly important; the foods is yummy and not too greasy
Our waiter was friendly and not too pushy
I'd just have to say that its well worth a try and I will surely be back for more!
Viviano's really does hit the spot
If you're looking for a laid back, friendly atmosphere where you can get an amazing panini or some seriously tasty pasta at a reasonable price, Vivianos is the place for you
Im lucky enough to work close by, and its a mainstay of my lunchtime restaurant rotation
You can also buy a host of authentic hard-to-find imported products
Ooooooo, and the homemade gelato, cant forget about that
Highly recommended for eat in and delivery
I actually had them cater a work function as well
In the upper east 90's, there aren't many good options for Italian in the way of delivery
Cafe Daniello's has AMAZING pasta dishes; large portions and an unbelievable sauce (it's got a kick!)
They even give you some amazing garlic bread, with chunks of garlic and butter! Great prices and fast delivery!
The Scene Part market, part deli, part restaurant--Midtowners get to choose the make of their Mediterranean meal
With delicacies beckoning from front and center--a stacked cheese display, a meat and custom sandwich counter, shelves of European goods, and brimming coffee bean bins--the hungry may get sidetracked before reaching the rustic, casual cafe and wine bar in back
Its brick walls, iron accents and wooden tables make for a quaint lunchtime setting
The Food One of the cheaper yet atmospheric sit-down spots around, this is a neighborhood find
Group and solo diners sample Mediterranean tapas like tzatziki, dip fondue, or munch on homemade grilled panini such as the Balkan made with namesake cheese Kashkaval, paprika and anise
Others design their own hearty sandwiches from a choice of more than 150 international meats and cheeses, also available by the pound
Grocery shoppers can stock up on European crackers, teas and other treats
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check
At $30 dollars for a dinner for one
you'd be better off going somewhere else
Everything looked so fresh and delicious
however, I wouldn't recommend a wrap
Go for the salads and sides
Everytime my husband and I go there, we are never disappointed
The wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling
If you are going out with friends and want some apps and wine and great/friendly service then you have to try this place
I loved this place!! I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded
The food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great
The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side
Overall, not worth the money
Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience
We arrived for lunch, and were able to be seated immediately
The waitress and owner were very accomodating, and attentive
We were impressed with the variety of menu choices, and puzzled on how we would classify this restaurant
We came up with mixed mediteranian
My dining partners each had the individual cheeze fondues (served with bread cubes; other dipping choices are extra)
They absolutely loved these! The cheeze is served hot and bubbly over a small sterno stove; the prefect choice on a cold winter day
I had the four selection appetizer plate and the red pepper spread is to die for
definitely worth the trip here alone
The fondues were $10 each, and the appetizer plate was cheaper yet
definitely value oriented
I know we will be coming back here soon; particularly when I start remembering that red pepper spread!
This is the best find in my new neighborhood
The fondue and cheese/meat plates are delicious and a great value- the wine list is extremely reasonable, diverse and accomodating to all

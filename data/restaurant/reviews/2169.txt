Great location overlooking Grand Central Station
Friendly staff
The food was amazing
I had a rib eye, it was just perfect
If steak was love this steak would have been the orgasm! Huge portions, so your best to share you side dishes
Wife had NY strip, again was the business
Ruth Chris was my best steak experience until I went to this place
A must do for anyone, especially Brits like myself, as you will never get steak like this at home
Simply put
brilliant food and location
Wow is the only word tha describe this place! i would recommend this place to anyone
MJ is the greatest basketball player ever and he owns the best resturant in the States
We were visting New York During the 2002 Thanksgiving Holiday
We decided to have dinner at Michael Jordan's
I give this restaurant a 10 - The food was excellent (we had the turkey and my husband had the steak) They give you so much food
The manager that night
was so nice to us and even came up to my son to talk to him
The restraunt overlooked Grand Central Station (all open) We were very very very happy with this restaurant
We often stop here for a quick drink if we are waiting for the train
The popcorn on the bar is addicting! The drinks are usually excellent; the bar tender will make anything you like
Yes, it's expensive but you know you're getting a good drink and can still make your train
When you dine at MJ's steakhouse or Sportsbar you know the perfection is off court as well as on!
Michael Jordan's restaurant is a bit pricey but you expect that
It has the feel of a man's restaurant
The food is quite good and the location is great overlooking Grand Central
Food was great
Pricey but what do you expect when you eat in one of the most beutiful buildings in the world
Everything a'la carte
Expect 110 for a dinner for two more if you are a heavy drinker
I especially recommend the creamed corn side
I went here for lunch with a friend yesterday
Found the place to be quite dark and a tad dreary
I ordered the chicken South Western Salad which was rather sickening, had too much of a mixture thrown in
My company choose the greek salad which had anchovies in it and had to be sent back
Overall not a great experience, will definitely not be back
We randomly stoped in for lunch and could not have picked better
We had a great lunch with soup worth it's wieght in gold
Prices that can't be beat
If you are in the mood for a casual bite and a few drinks this is the place! If a burger is what you feel like, order the Black Jack Burger, its sooooooo good! Love the barstaff, the guys are very entertaining! Its my new favorite place!
The Scene It's easy to understand why more people have heard of Nobu than Kuruma
For one thing, the restaurant isn't easy to find--only a small sign on street level gives it away
For another, Kuruma isn't particularly sexy--sure it's exclusive, but instead of flash, Kuruma exudes an earthy, elemental feel with elegant paper screens and wood and stone details
The crowd is a mix of well-off Americans and Japanese, but the restaurant has a longstanding reputation for serving all patrons well
The Food On this Japanese sushi menu, gloriously fresh fish is served in a way that omits no detail
Wasabi is freshly grated seconds before it's served, and sashimi is sliced from the bone before your eyes
Kuruma's several varieties of toro alone make it worth the visit, but quality doesn't come cheap: Expect to pay an average of $100 per person, even with a modest drink check
Just like an authentic sushi restaurant in Japan
I got the omakase (chefs menu) which was all sushi and included hand peeled kuruma shrimp, miniature sweet shrimp from zuruma region in japan
Heavy prices, but def worth it for the fish since most of it is flown in bi-weekly from japan
FYI, they do not serve any hot food or anything else
only raw fish
so if youre not a big sashimi/sushi fanatic, dont bother going here
However, if you love appreciate fresh sushi, then this is definitely the place to go
What sets this place apart really is the quality of the sushi - super fresh
The texture and the taste is markedly different and hands-down better than even that even great sushi restaurant
I've only been there for lunch, so it wasn't that expensive
The place is hard to find though
We were seated promptly, but I've only been there twice, so I'm not sure how the wait is usually
This is a great place to bring sushi lovers and sushi snobs
Head sushi chef was very professional and very entertaining, making the experience all the more enjoyable
We sat at the bar, which I recommend
Wait staff was very attentive
Sushi was as fresh as could be and tasted excellent, easily the best I've had in the city
Decor could use a good polish, it feels like 1983 in there
Very very expensive
I was curious about the rave of authentic sushi
Well, the staff was very nice but I was told they did not have certain fish, when I could see it in the case! I ordered some of the pieces (flown in from japan) they tasted like good sushi nothing more We had 2 small rolls, 4 pieces of sushi, one seaweed salad, club sodas and one ice cream and one 1/2 a piece of fruit
The tab was $100
00 - you decide!
If you know what is real Sushi or you want to know what real Sushi , you should go there
If you like or know just spicy tuna,you don't go there
It's not Japanese
This is not a place for average New Yorkers' sushi bar
It's authentic
Chefs are real Shokunin with years of training, and keep Japanese traditions unlike most Sushi restaurant in the US
If you want rolls, and trendy environment, skip this place
This place is for those who truly enjoys the culture, class, and traditions of Japanese art; Sushi
One bad thing about this place is, that they charge whatever they feel like charging according to a client, and only the regular partons get the best sushi
Jewel Bako reminds me of Kuruma Zushi in the mid 80's
New, trendy, interesting, slow, and in need of improvement
Since Kuruma Zushi never improved upon their limited selection of fish (a small U
S
Variety) they have fallen to the dregs of New York sushi goers, who would rather have an almost limitless supply of different types of fish that the New York ports can bring in, in under 24 hours from Japan, Africa, and New Zealand
Meanwhile Kuruma Zushi will only have the same types you can find in any Super Market frozen section
In this category, Jewel Bako has them beat hands down!  Jewel Bako is the Winner!
Ask any local who knows New York and it's vast sea of Japanese restaurants and you'll hear of legendary places like Blue Ribbon, Nobu, Sugiyama, Sachi, Gari, Tomoe, and Sushisay
What you won't hear is the old, decrepid, and oh so boring name Kuruma Zushi, but the truth of the matter is Kuruma Zushi does not need you, they have a clientel of very wealthy Japanese buisnessman that frequent their place, whom don't know any better, and don't mind shoveling out $450 for 3rd rate sushi
Pay heed to the USER RATING folks, Locals know best
Ever tried the refrigerated sushi to go at Gristedes, then you've also had Kuruma Zushi
Our expensive sushi was cold, and I mean really cold
It had not been made fresh at the bar, but kept in the freezer till we ordered, they also forgot our soup, kept us waiting for the frozen sushi for close to an hour
The Tuna Toro that is supposed to be so good here, is average, I've had better at lot's of places in New York City, and most of them were a lot less expensive than this deceiving, below average restaurant
Kuruma Zushi is strictly for tourists that don't know any better !
the sushi at Kuruma is exceptional
it's the place to go if you're interested in top quality sushi/sashimi
if you want to celebrity watch, or open a menu that reads like a beat-poet's bad dream, go to Nobu
Kuruma is all about serving the highest quality sushi with the least attendant fuss
the atmosphere is unpretentious, and the menu is simple, yet sublime
people who rate this place badly don't understand sushi, and don't deserve Kuruma
This place has AMAZING sushi

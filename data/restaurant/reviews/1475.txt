The fries looked anemic
And you'll walk away hungry, despite paying $10 for 3 eggs
I ordered a baked eggs with provencal herbs, which turn out to be just onions
Nice try
I stopped by this new Nolita spot the other night with a date and loved it
The Cuisine is very unique and fun to try
Loved the chicken cigars and drinks
The decor was fun and airy
Can't wait to go back and try more of the tasty dishes
Except next time I will try and bring a bigger crowd to taste more!!
I agree with the other reviews
Great tea, great service, great atmosphere
I plan on returning to Arium many times
I was, however, sad to learn that scones are not available on the lunch menu--they're available later in the day after lunch
Everything from tea selection to service is absolutely fabulous! It is my new favorite tea lunch place
I would definitely return here
I have been here for tea almost 5 times now and every time I am awed by the atmosphere and the high quality of the tea and food
It seems like there are a hundred different kinds of tea on the menu (each with its own description!)
There are 3 different types of tea courses - a scone one (served with lemon curd, clotted cream, jam marmalade), a mini sandwich course, and a dessert course
You can get any combination of them
I recommend ALL of them! They are so good
The space is also beautiful -- airy and serene
I also saw a flyer last time I was there that announced some piano concerts that are coming up
Perfect!
This is a lovely spot, recently opened in the Meat-Packing District
Open for lunch, serving a very interesting selection of soups, salads and sandwiches
The main reason to go however, is the stunning afternoon tea service
Probably the finest afternoon tea in NYC, with mouthwatering scones, amazing tea sandwiches of all types and unbelievable sweets, and a to-die-for tea list with almost every type of tea available
The service is simply outstanding
if you are looking for the perfect NYC tea time, this is it
forget all the other places (and we are lucky to have some very good places), drop everything and RUN to arium
the space is breathtaking
the ambience is tranquil
the service is fabulous and most importantly the food is FABULOUS and generously portioned
the full tea tray for $35 is a satisfying and well balanced (large) meal
there are over 100 teas to select from and these are not your average ho hum teas
they are top quality blends
love love LOVE it
an exceptional experience
an event!!
The food and service are impeccable
The portions are family style so get ready to take home left overs
The service is top notch
The restaurant and bathrooms are spotless
The Valet parking is so convenient
There is never a water glass left empty
You must visit and enjoy the experience!
If you live in Queens, youre lucky
If you live in Manhattan, its well worth the trip
The Family Restaurant is the best, most authentic Italian weve been to in years
The place is totally renovated, very freindly and real comfortable
Every dish was a delight
The red sauce incredible
The portions big! The wait staff friendly, efficient, and know their stuff
What a find! Homey neighborhood restaurant with great Italian food and friendly, attentive service--they really do treat you like family
Portions are huge, and everything is delicious
Plump mussels and tender fried calamari were both served with wonderful homemade sauces
The filet mignon was enormous, and prepared perfectly, and the shrimp and langostino over angel hair pasta with fra diavlo sauce was pure heaven
Even the veggies--like broccoli rabe sauteed with whole garlic cloves--were yummy
I can't wait to go back!
From the moment you arrive at the Family Restaurant you can feel the dedication to your comfort and enjoyment
The setting, a place to be in love or a place for friends and family, is comfortable, elegant and european in feel
Then the food
Be preapared to say to yourself why have I not dinned here before
The real Italian cooking is as authentic as anyplace in NY
Mouth watering Pastas, Chicken, Veal and Seafood dishes were all savoured by our group of 6
Wine is a must with a meal this delicious and authentic!
The pizza here is out of this world! I'm very picky with my pizza
I like just the right combo of suace and cheese and this place has it down pat
We went there for the first time on Saturday and we will definitely be back!
The best quick service place we were in all week, highly recommed for any one who wants real food
The absolute best falafel in Murray Hill! Open really late during the weekends so its definitely the place to hit after partying! They also deliver late should the alcohol make the sidewalk a little too blurry!
This is an all around eatery
The food is amazing, the service is friendly, the place is clean
Great for a easy and afordable meal
Met up with a group of friends here for a night out in the Lower East Side
Weather was very pleasant that evening so we enjoyed the outdoor seating area
Owner was very attentive to customers
I had the munchies and ordered the crab cake and it turned out to be very tasty
Martinis were great and the bar tab ended up being very reasonable
Conveniently located so afterwards we easily walked over to our next stop
I stop by Summers quite frequently now for the drinks, the fun friendly staff, the laid back environment and great food
They have a fantastic full menu with something for everyone and everything I have tried so far has been delicious
I highly recommend the enchiladas chimichunga
Went here with a friend this past weekend after spotting it on Citysearch
We went during Brunch which was a good thing because included in the low (New York) price were 2 drinks! The food was very good and served hot fresh
The waitstaff was very attentive and the place had a good feel to it
I'll be back next time I'm in the neighborhood
Great atmosphere
Wonderful brunch
But other menu items are pricey
Drinks are way over priced
No way should a vodka tonic cost $9
If you're willing to pay the price come and enjoy yourself
Grand Cafe is a very nice place
nice atmosphere
BUT it is very expensive
a salad w/chicken will cost you about $16! I think that's pricey for a SALAD! Other than that
hot waiters and a cool/hip cafe! :-)
Grand Cafe has an amazing ambiance

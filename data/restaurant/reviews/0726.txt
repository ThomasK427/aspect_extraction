Great Southern Italian cuisine
The fish is to die for and so are the salads
Contemporary decor, great service
Prepare to come back over and over again, you will not be able to help yourself
This new comer is a taste of heaven both in it's decor and cuisine
The service has you feeling like a King or a Queen and the atmosphere is second to none
It's a win, win night when dining at Acqua Pazza
The food was delicious, especially the seafood
Great bar, great drinks
From the minute I walked in this restaurant I was impressed
The place is gorgeous and you can feel the ambience
This is a great date place - it is very warm and romantic
I have been there twice and everything have ordered was superb
The bar area provides a phenominal socail atmosphere
I cannot wait to go back
I absolutely, positively love love love love love this place!!
The menu changes to refelct what's in season and what's fresh
The propreitor was a sushi chef for more than a decade in Manhattan and you can tell
The place might look a little strange from the outside and when you get in you might not be sure if it's a sush take out place or an art gallery but don't let that stop you
Table service would be great and would be an alternative to the 5 Thai restaurants on Manhattan Avenue! How good do you think the matzoh ball soup and corned beef would be at your local tapas restaurant? Or what about fish and chips at the local pizza joint? Exactly! If you want good sushi go to a real Japanese sushi restarant
The Scene Even the most polite conversationalists will find their eyes wandering, as a parade of notable names makes its way past the long communal table toward the more exclusive dining room in the rear
It's clear that, from the urban-esque soundtrack--ABBA, Destiny's Child--to Richard Meier's understated, sleek interior, the place is meant to attract as many hipsters as gastronomes
The Food For the most part, it's solid, sometimes impressive Chinese: One can easily find better pork buns and Peking duck in Chinatown, but then you'd have to settle for dining with regular folks
Vongerichten's genius is in the details: A tart citrus twinge balances the buttery shrimp and foie gras dumplings; delicately seasoned tuna tartar is served at the absolute perfect temperature
Sauces are quite good, especially a glossy red wine and soy reduction served with beef shortribs, and a remarkably complex black bean sauce glazing the lobster
Don't save room; desserts are disappointing
While I love Jean Georges other restaurants, I was not that impressed with 66
We made reservations for a late Friday night and ended up waiting about 40 minutes for a table which wasn't too bad
However, the table was in a bad area and we could barely hear ourselves so we asked to move to the huge commune-style table
We were the only ones there besides a group of guys all the way at the other end which was great
I had wanted to go mostly for their pork buns which I'd heard from a friend were great, but they aren't even on the menu anymore
The food we did order wasn't anything special but at least cheaply priced
With two drinks each, a few appetizers, a meal each (for 2) and dessert, we ended up spending about $140 after tip
Not bad, but not highly recommended either
I was at 66 and was very impressed
I went with group of friends and had a lot of fun with the family style meals
We all ended up staying until almost closing time drinking in the lounge
The atmosphere was very chic, and the food was delicious
I liked the food so much I've now started ordering from their takeout menu for lunch
I went to 66 the other night with a group of my friends for my birthday
I was pleasantly surprised by the beautifully designed ambience and delicious food
There's nothing else like this in NY
I really enjoyed the family-style presentation of the food
The food tasted super fresh
I still felt like I was eating traditional Chinese food only elevated in quality
It's so nice to have this Chinese experience in a chic, sophisticated beautiful environment
Some friends of mine who live in the neighborhood say it's the best Chinese food they've ever had!
Mistake was going to this restaurant based on reviews for Valetines Day
Overpriced chinese food where you can go 5 blocks, get less salty food, and pay 3/4 of the price charged
Asked for recommendations, waitress said read everything on the menu which already wasn't to unique
The only thing nice was the Decor but didn't go there to pay for scenery
Utterly, dissatisfied
Great atmosphere, impeccable service, a very different concept in a city where everybody else follows the leader
Yumcha and Kittichai don't shake a stick at Jean Georges Vongerichten
Clean, dynamic, and refreshing inspired dishes made my dinner a memorable one
Service was always around but never in the way
I can't order Chinese take-out the same way ever again
p
s
, check out the long table!!
I took a date here during restaraunt week, and I was totally disappointed
The entrees tasted like microwaveable meals, the appetizers were ordinary, the sauces seemed like they came from a bottle, and the dessert was worse than packaged food
Overall I think it was a huge rip off, less enjoyable than the local take out joint down the street and four times as expensive
I went to 66 with a group of 8 people on Saturday night
The service had to be one of the worst I have experienced in the city
In addition to one waiter spilling an entree onto one person's back, we received more than one incorrect dish and waited an eternity for sub par food
To complete the experience, after 2+ hours and our plates cleared, we suddenly received one of the missing appetizers we ordered - as we were getting ready to pay the check! The food was overpriced and the service was atrocious
I will not return
What a great dining experience! I have been to several Jean Georges restaurants many times
Each time has been a delight and with 66 there is no exception
I love the disign, very hip
I went there with 2 friends, we dicided to share dishes so we could taste many of them
we were in haven from appetizers, my favorite was the tuna tartare, to the dim sum,the best was shrimp and foie gras dumpling, and i could go on and on, everything was an explosion of flavors
The service was exceptional, everybody was nice, friendly and professional
(very refreshing in the city!)
My only regret is that I didn't go there before, but i'll be back soon
I would have expected much better food from a Jean-Georges establishment
The decor is nice but the horrible, snooty service and the bland food made the entire experience a waste of time
Our waiter didn't know anything about the food and couldn't care less about providing good service
On our way out, we complained to the maitre d about the food and even she agreed that there are much better places that we can go to for delicious chinese food
I wish I had heeded warnings before I decided to go
I took clients there for lunch and we were only the 3rd party there; the place was empty
Our waiter should have really been a bus-boy, because he lacked any interpersonal skills and was extremely aloof
He indicated that the courses were meant to be served family style but he failed to mention that he meant a family of ants because we had to order 2 of everything in order to satiate our appetites
I did not find the food impressive in any way, shape or form
Was it even Chinese food? It was dubbed Improvisational Chinese but with some dishes, even THAT is a bit of a stretch
Jean-Georges really bombed with this one
Don't waste your dollars here
There are far better places to eat
66 gets a really bad rap (too expensive for Chinese, poor service, etc), but I've dined there 6 times in 2 years and I've always been impressed by the food
This week I tried a chilled honeydew melon soup with peekytoe crab that knocked my socks off
People should understand that this isn't take-out style Chinese
It's not moo-shoo or chow mein or greasy noodles
It's an upscale American version of Chinese, simple and delightful
I dare you to find a better, lighter egg roll, or more flavorful, spirit-lifting hot and sour soup
Go in with no prejudices and you will love it
66 was a huge disappointment for me and my family who went there
The food and drinks were good and even better then average but the service was horrible
When we finally had to see the manager because I had lemon juice spilled on me from the waiter- she even took over 10 minutes to come to the table
The situation was verified by taking 3 dishes that were over an hour late off the bill and free desserts and coffee but the experience left most of us never wanting to go to the supposed hip cool 66 ever again

I had the lamb chops served with asparagus and ricotta gnocchi which melts in your mouth
Although the most expensive on the menu, you figure you absolutely get what you pay for
QUALITY!! And kuddos to the pastry chef for the chocolate babka bread pudding with, wait for it, sour cream ice cream
who knew? My friend started with something called the Maple Drop
I think it was a mix of whiskey and maple syrup
She said it was simply divine
Way to go ZOE, for getting it right!!!
I took my girlfriend there for dinner
We were celebrating her birthday, which i mentioned to the hostess so they would put a candle in her dessert
What i didnt realize is that they send out a free mini birthday cake with a candle and HAPPY BIRTHDAY written in chocolate
Thanks Zoe for making my girlfriends birthday special
I don't understand everyone foaming at the mouth
The best American food in New York, Zoe claims? I'll admit I don't eat American that often, but I've had better food of this style at much less expensive places
I'm not trying to rip them, just being honest -- here's what I had: Hot Sour Shrimp soup
I guess it was supposed to be like Thai-style Tom Yum, but the broth was bland, not spicy, way too sweet, and not very tangy at all
$10 for soup that was not pleasurable at all
For an entree I should have been more adventurous, but every menu item that aroused my interest had some form of pork in it (ham, bacon, prosciutto, you name it), most of the time superfluously, I went for the Portabello sandwich
The aioli was nasty, the foccocia greasy
No better than your average token portabella sandwich
went to Zoe in the summer for summer special, $30 3-course dinner
my friend and i enjoyed not only the food but also the comfortable atomasphere there
the waitress was very friendly and attentive
they have good selection of wines as well
this place is good for a couple or small group of friends
i will go back again!
I recently went to Zoe with my boyfriend and another couple - what a perfect place to start a fun night
Not only is Zoe in a perfect neighborhood which allows you to go out and enjoy it's plethora of bars, but the ambience and service and overall dining experience is superb
This comes highly recommended
Hint - order the calamaris for the table - they are divine
After shopping SoHo for hours waiting for my wife to finish work, we shopped some more in 90 degree heat
Then when it was time to eat we found ourselves in front of the Delightfully bright and airy look of ZOE
Skimmed the menu and entered the doorway to be greeted with a friendly smile and welcome
We arrived at the right moment w/o reservations and were seated in the center of the room and could see all the action and enjoy the atmosphere, simply gourmet food being served with style and panache by the friendliest staff we've ever encountered in a NY Restaurant in a long time where we were not related or known by the staff! Can't say more than excellent and will be back for more!
Coming from Scotland where we are producers of some of the freshest, tastiest food in the world, and also having travelled the world words cannot describe my experience at Zoe Restaurant
I have visited NY many times before and will without doubt return to this little gem of a place
The service was without doubt the best I have ever recieved anywhere in the world and the food was also without doubt the best I have ever tasted in the world
A fantastic menu, fantastic wine menu and fantastic staff
What else can I say - Go try it tonight
Thankyou everyone at Zoe for making my last night in Ny one to treasure
I entertained some clients recently at Zoe and had an amazing experience
The service is top notch - something I haven't seen in a while (except at the high-end places)
The manager helped me select wine - there were too many choices! The food was also outstanding - I had the lamb, and my associated had the tuna and double cut pork chop
I didn't have desert, but my clients loved them (they looked good!)
I am coming back next week with my wife friends
On a second visit, this time with friends since we had enjoyed the first so much, we were just as pleased
Food was enticing and delicious and the service was excellent
Great ambiance, genial crowd; heartily recommended
Thankyou Zoe
Since 1988 when I lived in a loft just a stones throw from this spot I've watched the neighbourhood change at a disturbing rate of knots
oe is such a saving grace
You walk in and you're home
I'm always greeted by one of the owners with a smile and a firm handshake no matter how busy they are
The food is always a delight, suprising me in new and wonderful ways at every visit
(I'm particularly partial to the game whenever it makes an appearance on the menu)
The service sparkles
I like a place where the bartender remembers me, even when I've been out of town for six months
If you want to immerse yourself in some real New York City culture don't hesitate to make this a priority

My fiancee and I had dinner there last week
Not only was our meal excellent, but the service was knowledgeable and friendly
We also got an affordable and tasty bottle of Pinot Noir
We had the chocolate-espresso molten cake for dessert
delicious! All in all a great date
I took my best friend here for her birthday and the food was excellent
I was a little disappointed in the decor- it looked 80's and the lighting wasn't quite right (too high)
They were very kind to bring a surprise bday cake
Overall the food was worth the visit but I am not sure I would go back
I prefer somewhere with more atmosphere for the price
I found the food to be excellent (I recommend the Polenta fries) and so far I've never had a problem being seated just showing up
I'd have no problem taking a date or a group of friends there
The best time is had when you sit at the Chef's Counter
Sample dishes, learn recipes, watch the hustle and bustle of a working kitchen, great service and great people
Ward James of the Chicago James' continues his tour of NYC at Zoe, allegedly one of Soho's hippest
Stopped in for lunch on a drizzly Friday afternoon and was greeted with a pleasant, comfortable and spare room reminiscent of several places in LA
The wine list was exhaustive but I was in a beer mood--an even better mood when I learned they carried Pilsner Urquell (always worth a point in my reviews)
We were in a bit of a hurry so after scarfing down not one but two fine bread baskets (the infused olive oil was top notch) I went with the lunch special--soft shell crab sandwich which was absolutely excellent while my lady had the tuna/wasabi sandwich which was almost as good
And with that, we were off
Service was confused but polite
As the title suggests, the verdict is Bread 9, circus 6
5
Bon Appetit, Ward James
The food is excellent and the presentation is one of the most creative in town
If you like anything to do with cooking, you'll appreciate the open kitchen
Just be prepared to pay for what you order, though the food is well worth it
Making a reservation is not a bad idea
In response to the mixed reviews below, I can say that I have been told that anything other than their weekend brunch is just OK
With that said, I must opine that our brunch experience was absolutely wonderful! Even the complimentary scones and muffins were hard to resist
Their brunch cocktails will leave you a bit dazed but they're delish! The omelet of sauteed onion and gruyere cheese was perfectly light and fluffy
but PLEASE order the brioche french toast
It was sinfully good
Our service, while somewhat sparse, was always aware of when we needed more water or another drink or a fork when I dropped mine
Granted service should always be aware of these things without having to be summoned, but for a fairly busy Saturday brunch, the service was laudable
Definitely worth a visit for weekend brunch
Zoe was a great place to go for the $20
02 Restaurant Week special
They offered lots of options (4 choices for each course): I had an excellent, mild gazpacho to start, a pedestrian chicken in a cocoa nib crust with bing cherry sauce as the main (sauce = excellent, crust = so so), and a serviceable chocolate tart for dessert
I, of course, tasted my coworkers choices, and found the fig salad to be an excellent melding of flavors, the morroccan lamb to be a fabulous entree
The halibut was less than expected
But overall, not bad for $20

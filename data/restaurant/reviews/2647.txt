there is also a back dining room which can accommadate large groups
Simple but wonderful italian
The service is impeccable
And since it took a while before appearing on most surveys, I would say it's a hidden gem in the Wall Street/Financial District area
One caveat: Expensive, a comparable Italian meal may be had for less elsewhere in NYC (including the boroughs)
Very nice restaraunt way downtown
Food was delicious although portions were smaller than I would have liked for the price
Service was great from our waiter average from support staff
Recomend for an after work date downtown
The food was very good, waiters were very attentive and smiling
I can't wait to go back
We loved the complementary antipasto spread they give you before ordering your food!!!!
Numerous staff and not a smile in the house
The bad hotel-lobby decor alone should have sent me running, but I reminded myself of the rave reviews in Zagat's and Citysearch
At the table, only one place setting included a napkin
When our waiter finally came to take our order he disgustedly asked us if we were doing the prix fixe - which we were
We politely asked for napkins, which arrived much later, without apology
We never saw our waiter again
The appetizer, a salad, came right out of a bag
The glass of wine I ordered never came
Once I had the opportunity to ask about it (after my main course had arrived), there was no apology and a sloppily poured glass was plopped down
This went WAY beyond just being an off night - surely there was a mix-up at Zagats
I've been to this restaurant a dozen times now for both business and pleasure, and not once have I been disappointed
The service has been wonderful, and each time I've been greeted by the overly gracious host who makes the visit even better
Not to mention the food, which is excellent! There is plenty of room downstairs for large business lunches and cocktail parties
Hidden down in the Valleys this resturant really earns its keep
Very pleasant experience for an out of towner
The absoulte worst way to fork over $150 for an unedible meal!!  I dined at L'orto in December 2000 and was so impressed by them that I went back on last Friday evening, for my boyfriend's birthday, no less
Dissapointed does not begin to say it
The portobello mushrooms in balsamic vinegar tasted like it had been drowned in A1 sauce
My entree of chicken with italin sausage tasted like a chinese take-out
I could not eat more than the inital one bite and the waiter did not even ask me what was wrong with the dish!!!! Once an absolutely fabulous place but now you couldn't fina a bigger dump! You have been WARNED
Everyone I take here loves it and makes it their favorite Italian restaurant Downtown
The food is always excellent
Service is top-notch
Good wine selection
Never noisy
A bit pricey, but you're on an expense account
so enjoy!
THE BAD: I like my burritos with everything, but the best part is the pico de gallo
That's what packs the real taste
Unfortunatelly this place packs mostly (90%) rice and beans in their burritos
At 6
50 for a burrito, that is not right
I would eat here more often if they stopped this stingy wrapping
THE GOOD: This place just moved to Nassau Street, just a block away
I must say that I like their new location
They now have nice tables and no one is standing on top of you waiting for their food as you try to eat your own
In Short This clean, contemporary-looking Korean eatery (family-run: its name means "three sisters") is frequently busy, but the servers are always friendly
The specialty of the house is bibimbop, featuring vegetables and a choice of meat offerings, topped with a fried egg
It can be ordered in a sizzling stoneware pot to ensure extra crispness
Other Korean favorites are on the menu too, including scallion and seafood pancakes, grilled beef ribs and stir-fried squid served atop rice noodles
Compared to places in Koreatown, this place would be below average
But since it's probably one of the few Korean places in the financial district, it's ok
Super-packed at lunch during the week for the lunch specials, which is a decent $10 weekday lunch
Bulgogi looks bland and steamed though
Dol sots are just average and pan chan seem uninspired
Authentic tasty and affordable lunches - rivals that of K-town
Only gripe is that this place has only 1 outlet in Manhattan
Good priced Korean place, with home-made style kim-chee! The place stays open for dinner in an area where it's mostly-lunch only so it's a good spot for a quick, after-work inexpensive meal
Good bibimbop and dumplings!
If you're like me and work downtown, then there aren't a lot of korean lunch options outside trekking to 32nd st
The food here is actually pretty good
Pass on the kalbi box but try the dolsot dishes
The kimchi dolsot is pretty good
The place is pretty small so there's always a wait during prime lunch hours
Staff is nice, but my biggest complaint is that they're really cheap on the banchan(side dishes)-they get a lot of non-korean customers so I guess they figure they won't know
we came upon this place walking to get out of the crowd at the seaport
its a find located next to the brooklyn bridge
it looks more like a local hangout than a tourist trap
We had the curry chimichanga and spinach enchiladas )at the suggestion of the waitress) It was fantastic
We shared a flan for dessert and i have never tasted better
We were told in the summer we can bring our dogs down to hang out at the patio
So we will definitely be back
We recommend this place and suggest when you go ask the staff for suggestions
this place is a truly great find
!!!!!! the food was tasty and the staff made you feel welcome and glad to be serving you
The atmosphere is not upscale but its a place where you feel comfortable going in to enjoy a great meal
Pool table in the back
we found this place walking , it looks like a local hangout but definitely welcoming
the waitstaff were engaging while making sure we wanted for nothing
the food was great ,especially their spinach enchaladas and fajitas
very kid friendly
if you are looking for a good night out , inexpensive, this is great
This is a surprisingly good find
We were out walking the South Street Seaport
Good food, good service
It's divey but not seedy
It did not feel like New York, but it didn't feel touristy either
We ate the enchiladas suizas and mexican fettucine
Both were good
It was not expensive
No attitude
Afterward we played pool on the only table
There was a slim view of the Brooklyn Bridge outside the windows
Comfortable, good food, just a decent all around place
Cute place for a drink, but there's much better Mexican elsewhere
A seedy old joint that's fun for drinks and snacks
This is one of my favorite lunch spots
If you like empanadas this place is a must try

The bar looked like a good place to sit and have a mohito or a Guava Colada, but their upstairs lounge didn't look too happening
Our waiter was the friendliest guy, and the manager even stopped by for a chat
We were made to feel like very special guests, and just had a blast
For a joint that claims that they are the lower east side burger cafe it doesn't make sense to me that they serve frozen burgers
Additionally, it seems to me that most of the people behind the counter have a lethargic attitude
If you don't want to be there find a new job
Finally, you say you're open till late but when I show up an hour before you close the fryers are already turned off
Where is the pride?
In an area not known for much too choose from when it comes to dinning out , i heard of a spot that was romantic and had an exotic menu that infused euro culinary skills with carribean ingredients and that alone was enough to peek my interest, so yesterday i took a friend and gave don pedros a try
wow , i was pleasantly surprised
The servers introduce themselves as your dining host and were detailed and attentive , the energy was vibrant and contagious ,the music took my ears and feet on a vacation to the islands, and finally the food was delicious and very well presented, oh yeah not to mention the mojitos were heavenly
The kicker was the minimum damage to my wallet
Well priced delicious festive fine dinning and a get cocktail selection what more could i ask for
oh yeah maybe some outside seating and a little extra decor
I highly reccommend this restaurant
I don't know what happened to Don Pedro's
Lately I've been eating there and it's not the same
I mean the food is still good but the service just REEKS!! well it was never the best but now it's worse
There was a time were everything was going great excellent service, excellent food everything was good
How can things change in a matter of day's
Here's a TIP to the owner PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR RESTURANT TRAIN YOUR SERVERS BETTER OR HIRE BACK YOUR OLD SERVERS BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME
DO IT FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS I BEG OF YOU!!!!!! I'm a loyal customer but things could change SERVICE IS WHAT COUNTS
P
S
Ask for the special's because now a days the waiters won't mention it
Don Pedro's is one of my favorite restaurants
The food is incredible
Go for the Seafood Paella for two
Even for two very hungry people there is plenty of food left to be taken home (it reheats really well also)
All of the apetizers are good and the Sangria is very good
Really nice restaurant to go with a group or on a date
Service is usually pretty good
Highly recommend!
The person behind the bar should be better trained in hospitality
Food sucks and drinks are awful (horrible pina coladas)
The only possitive thing was the music, great salsa
This review is way over due
my fiance and I have been consistent visitors of this NYC hidden treasure
incredible is just one of the words we can use to describe the drinks,service,food and last but not least the desert
don pedros can get very busy but it is worth any delay ther may be wich in our experience has been never
the owner j is always on hand to make sure everything is going well
there is no returaunt in NYC that makes a better latin dish than don pedros
I have been to Don Pedro's countless times and love it

The food is amazing, so so tasty
The portions are huge and I love the plaintain and chili popcorn bread basket they put on the table when you are seated
However, there is a difference btw
weekend and weeknight service
The servers are always nice (if not sometimes hard to understand) but when they get busy, they get overwhelmed and you can wait an hour for your meal
The mojito's are also great made with real sticks of sugar cane-excpet when it's busy they all of a sudden don't taste very good
I think if you stick to the weeknights-you will be thrilled
If not, be prepared for a long evening
P
S if they offer the sea bass with plaintain mash special-get it!!!
Though I'm Italian, I LOVE Caribbean food
I've been to this spot several times
on dates, with coworkers, even with some family
The food is mouth-watering and always looks like small works of art! It's amazing what you get for their prices
However, the service can be hit or miss
I've had some really friendly servers, and some not so friendly
Same can be said about the bar
Depends who's behind it
The middle of the week bartenders seem to be the coolest and can make the most dangerous drinks, plus they're pretty easy on the eyes
If this place could have better service, it would score a perfect 10
I did some research on the net and came across this rest
WHAT A GREAT CHOICE
I was seated prompty, staff was friendly/ attentive
THE FOOD WAS MAGNIFICENT!! we orderedM, Tortita de Cangrejo (crab cake) and Chicharrones de Pollo (crisp chunks of chicken) for the main course I had, Pollo al Ajillo (boneless chicken w/ wine, butter and lemon) w/ Tostones for dessert I had the caramel flan
WOW!!!!!!!!! IS THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS FOOD
EVERY SINGLE ITEM WAS SPICED TO PERFECTION AND TOOK ME BACK TO MY TRIP TO SPAIN
I WOULD HAVE KISSED THE COOK IF HE HAD COME OUT FROM THE KITCHEN :) Unlike most restaurants in NYC, Don Pedro allowed us the time we needed for after dinner talk and to let our food settle
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AUTHENTIC LATIN FOOD
LOOK NO FURTHER DON PEDRO IS THE BEST BET IN MANHATTAN
If you want to have a quiet dinner with salsa music in the background this is the place to go! The food is awesome! Unlike the drinks and the service!!!!!!!!!!! Terrible mojitos and mango drinks
service sucks but food compensates
Nice place
I would definitely do take out! oh,
tiniest mens restroom I've ever seen!
This a must-go-to spot in the Upper East Side
The food is incredible and the presentation is amazing
My only recommendation would be to go on a slower night
On the weekends this place can get pretty packed
I found the bartender to be quite short with us and rude, and our server was easily irritated when we changed our order
A couple of my friends who have been there also said the same thing
Nevertheless, the food was so amazing that we'll definitely go back
We'll just try to go on less busy days
Agree , with the other's finally an Excellent restaurant offering good and unique designed CUban , Dominican food
Wish this place had more advertisement, so I could have found it earlier
Great drinks as well
Slightly small inside, but what god NYC restaurants aren't
This is such a great restaurant
I tried it on a whim because it's in my neighborhood
I've been three times now
It's great for dates and if you have a large group just call ahead
The staff accomodated us and there was a big table ready and waiting when we walked in the door
The food: Mouth-watering
I've had the sea bass special that came over yucca, I believe, with a blueberry reduction
It was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had
I've also tried the churrasco and one of the chicken dishes
Also, great sangria, a nice and helpful staff, and pleasant atmosphere

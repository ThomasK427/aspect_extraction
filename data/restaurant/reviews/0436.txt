I am going back for sure
I've been to Deborah at least 5 times and each visit was spectacular
Great food, great atmosphere and good service
Their Valentine's Day price fixe was a disaster
Both 1st courses were shellfish with no alternate choices allowed
Their usual rack of lamb was decimated to 2 small pieces as part of their special and the dessert was literally a chocolate covered strawberry that was frozen solid
All in all, my experience at Deborah will be my last
Extremely disappointing
I will no longer recommend this restaurant to people as a hidden secret
Poor, poor experience
I went to Deborah for the first time after hearing their brunch was excellent and, although the food was very good, I will never go back
The waitress could not make it more obvious that she wanted us to order and eat in the shortest amount of time possible-- from coming every minute to ask if we were ready to order to finally saying that we really needed to settle the check although we still had our coffee cups full, she really made our overall experience terrible
Deborah for Sunday brunch is NOT a good way to relax before starting your week
I've been going to Deborah since they first opened and have always enjoyed the great (sometimes salty) food
Lately, however, Deborah's insistence on whistling when orders are ready and her waitstaff's need to rush people out, have made brunch unbearable and completely stressful
It's sad
but I never want to got back
Deborah's brunch menu is fantastic
I've gone back and had everything! Huevos Rancheros tied with Duck for first place
Wonderful space in the west village
Highly recommended!
Me and my girlfriend go to Deborah's at least twice a month
We are a lesbian couple and feel very comfortable at this restaurant
The waitresses (especially Alex) are great and know how to make EVERYONE feel welcomed
We love the Mussels in cilantro sauce, the spicy calamari and most of all the APPLE MARTINIS made by David, our regular drink (they even give you little apple sour candy in the martinis)! We've brought friends to this restaurant and it has become everyone's favorite place! KUDOS!
All I have to say is that the Macaroni Cheese was absolutely the richest and tastiest Mac Cheese I've ever had
Absolutely to die for
Highly HIghly recommended
7 of us went to Deborah on a Saturday night
The place is quite small, but nice
Most of the appetizers were salads, but we shared an order of the fried calamari and the crispy phyllo triangles, both were quite tasty, and a little spicy
Entrees were excellent, with large portions
The BBQ spareribs mentioned in the editorial review was delicious
The cajun spiced tilapia was great, with a little spicy kick
The halibut was good, as were the pork chops and the large roast chicken
For dessert, we ordered the chocolate and vanilla ice cream sundae, the creamy banana pudding, and the banana something torte
All three were delicious!  Our waitress was pleasant and attentive
She made recommendations when we asked, and even asked discreetly if we were there for a special occasion (we weren't)
My best friend intro'd me to Deborah's about 2 years ago and It's become a standard in our dining rotation
The spot is cozy and welcoming, the staff is efficient and friendly and it has the best food in the city for the price
The Sunday Brunch is to die for and a delicious Mind Eraser is just the thing to wipe a way a hard day at work!  We've become such regulars the servers and host as well Deborah herself know us by name
It's pretty hot
Give it a shot! You won't be disappointed
After having lived in Greenwich Village for two years I was told about Deborah, specifically about their turkey burger, and ordered it for dinner one night this winter
One bite into that turkey burger and I was instantly hooked
Deborah's prompt delivery service was just the first pleasant surprise but was a sign of the overall quality of this superb restaurant
The food is all inventive and all amazing
I was surprised to see that the brunch was not a nominee for best brunch in the City because in my esteemed opinion, I truly believe theirs is the best around
Go for the shirred eggs and I promise you won't be sorry
Be careful, many dishes automatically contain the chipotle aioli, so if you're a mayo hater like myself, beware! Other than that, I have nothing but glowing reviews for Deborah!
I've been wanting to come to Deborah's for a long time and I finally had brunch there on Sunday
The ambiance was perfect
The staff were all incredibly friendly, kind, polite - you could tell they all enjoyed working there
And they did not try to push you out of your seat when you were done eating
they allowed you to enjoy your meal and to remain content, calm, and comfortable
Each dish had a unique, wonderful mix of flavors, food, and they were all visually appealing! I can't wait to go back there for dinner and more brunches
If you haven't tried it GO NOW!!
I love this place- The fod is terrific and the prices even better- My partner is a chef and he agrees that this is one of the freshest, most 'un-nyc' meals around, loved by people in the restaurant business
Great atmosphere and extrordinary comfort food
I recommend the calamari, mac and cheese with turkey kielbasa, and the halibut - absolutely yummy!
Not only is the food absolutley off the meter at this restaurant, the ambiance is one that makes you never want to leave AND the servers are wonderful
I feel a part of a wonderful, intimate family when I walk in and they take care of me just the same way
The diverse menu makes you want to try new things that you've never tried before just as well as establish some of your restaurant favorites (the mac and cheese is mine)  WONDERFUL WONDERFUL! I'm going to eat there tonight!!
it's a really cute little place, they have a lovely brunch and an really nice wait staff
they chicken sandwich is really really good and the saki sangria is too
they also have a garden, which is nice
the food can be a bit heavy, though
portion control needed
I recently visisted New York with my wife
We were recommended to Deborah's by some of New York's finest fire fighters
Their were dead on! My wife and Aunt (a New Yorker) loved the dining experience
I recommend to travelers and New Yorker's to visit between 5:30 and 6:30 to beat the rush
We were seated immediately, given great service and the food was excellent and reasonably priced for a dining out experience in the Big Apple
We dined at other restaraunt's (Little Italy) and the West Village and this was our favorite during our trip
I've been to Deborah's a few times and really like the atmosphere and the food
The comfort food items on the menu like mac and cheese and ribs are great
It's a nice change from the usual snobby places to eat
Deborah is fun and filling, but the menu is not always on the mark
For example, the greatest dish served was removed (the risotto), which is a mistake because it was always sold out and all my friends always recommended it
The wine is excellent and the ambience is charming
All who visit will be pleasantly sated
My date and I went to Deborah's, knowing it was going to be good
but not THAT good
Wow
We split 3 appetizers and one entree
The fried oysters were fresh and the spicy sauce added a welcomed kick
We shared the lamb entree which was perfect in every way and the side of butternut squash was a great addition
Normally we like to share one dessert, but we couldn't resist getting our own
The key lime pie-lette was great, but my date's cheesecake (cannot remember the flavor right now), was YUM! We can't wait to go back!
Deborah's was one of the best restaurants I ate at while in New York
For appetizers the Fried Calamari and Grilled Pizza set the stage for our main course
My order of Fish and Chips was delicious, with the french fries perfectly fried and salted
However, nothing could prepare me for the fantastic dessert-a Key Lime Tartlette, which was DELICIOUS
Honestly it was the best piece of key lime pie I have ever had
So go to Deborah's and enjoy the food and cozy atmosphere
great salads
good value
good service
i would gladly revisit this place!!
Cute but cramped setting

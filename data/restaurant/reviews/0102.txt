it was the worst steak frites i ever had
The french fries were cold and too greassy
As a french citizen have one thing to say!!! The bouillabaisse sucked and for the price go see balthazar!!!
I'm an American, though I've lived in Europe for the past ten years (where I know things are a little different
) Still, I work in New York very often
Pastis appears to be a basic place to eat
I was truly surprised to be treated with indifference, bordering on disdain, shoved into a crowded table where I had specifically asked not to sit and served up diner food at haute cuisine prices
Overpriced wine served in a juice cup
is that a concept?
it ain't French, I'll tell you that
Always packed
Food and drinks are always good
Great salads and great polenta
Great place to meet friends
Always busy
Love the high ceilings and open feeling
very European
Wine is great here and I love the glasses
many to choose from
Very sceney at times
good place to be
lovely room
great crowd for people watching
breakfast and lunch during the week offer the best service--and usually no fighting the crowds
the TINY glasses of cheap wine at $7 - $8 each is where they make their money
buy a bottle or skip the alcohol altogether to make this place the right choice
Serves up the best Bloody Mary I've found in the city (so far)
Good food -- the Irish oatmeal is a great way to kick off a warm spring morning, especially after a long night out
But cheap this place ain't -- the Bloody Marys and Irish oatmeal price out at $9 each
nothing at pastis is out of this world, but everything is done well, and other than the spotty service it is a solid place
i think it is best for lunch, especially when you can eat outdoors on a nice day, but almost anytime you will be satisfied
i have alwways thought that the standard items are better than the more exotic items on the menu
certainly best restaurant in the neighborhood
Buehl, the weekend bartender, is great
He (and the excellent brunch, especially the frisee salad and the eggs benedict) is the reason why we head to Pastis on Sundays and sit at the bar
Excellent Bloody Marys add to the experience
Passable food but the place is so mobbed that the staff seem to be almost at breaking point
Brunch should be spectacular--- and mine was just so at Pastis this past Sunday
The food was fantastic-- potatos that needed no katsup; perfectly scrambled eggs that melted in my mouth
Service was excellent, and our request to sit outdoors on the first nice day of the season was honored within 15 minutes of our reservation time
Our food had only been ordered 10 minutes when our plates were brought to our table
The price was right too--I spent under $30 for my entree and two drinks
In short I had a blast-- this is what Sunday brunch is supposed to be
Needless to say, I have a new brunch spot and it is Pastis
Simply put, I am always impressed with Pastis
Last night I had a simply wonderful meal (steak taratare and then a whole roasted fish) plus wonderful wines and digestifs
It is busy and loud and crowded, but, hey, can you blame people for wanting to get into this excellent place? I highly redommend it to anyone who loves true French bistro style food
It's a great French Bistro
The Steak Frites are as good as it gets
The decor is very cool, very French Bistro-y
Crowd is a mix of West Villagers, some from the fashion industry and a couple of preppy geeks
If you have never been then I recommend you go for a casual and fun dinner
Best time to go-summer
we ate here recently and it is definately a cheaper just as funky destination to it's sister balthazar! would recommend it without a doubt, spotted a few celebs on our night in! the staff were attentive without intrusive and the food was WONDERFUL! would def go again!
Food mediocre
I've had better croque-monsiuer's elsewhere
The wine list was decent, but the wine glasses are lacking, well, the stems
Desserts were great, though the menus was remarkable similar to that of French Roast and the warm choclate cake not as good
The atmosphere was nice, though not really very romantic if that's what you're going for
Serveice could have been better considering there weren't that many tables seated
i haven't eaten inside pastis in almost a year
then why am i reviewing it?? BECAUSE THEY DELIVER!!! Absolutely hands-down the best food you can get delivered to your apartment in 20 minutes
steak -frites, frisee salad, croque-madame, fish and chips, skate, tarts, really a fabulous reason to never cook
Went for dinner recently and the host sat us right by the front door even though it was less than half full
When we asked to be moved from the front door he rolled his eyes, looked around and kind of shrugged
We stayed where we were despite being very cold
The tables are very small also
The food was okay although the fries were very greasy
The waiter was nice once he got to us, it took about 5 minutes to get a glass of water and someone to get us started even though it was very slow
The place needs new management because it is run by people who don't seem to care
Went to dinner with friends, food was good, but the waitress was snippy, gave several exasperated sighs, kept pushing us to order more wine - on a sunday night - and now I realize that she added an eztra 20% to my debit charge
this city is full of great french bistros without the attitude or the fraud
I am French and I totally loves this place
It is a great French bistro
The steak frites and the croque madame are just like the ones served in France
Good atmosphere, the service is so-so and there is a long wait if you don't have reservations
went to brunch at pastis b/c i heard great things
was truly disappointed
they charged exorbinant amounts for tomatoes in my eggs and for toast with my omlette
they were pretentious and the waiter was too cool to be helpful
will never go back or recommend it
you are better off at grange hall
Best fries in New York, hands down
The food matches up as well
Made me feel like I was in a cafe in the South of France
It's a bit tucked away, a little harder to find, but well worth the search
I had a very nice meal at Pastis
Ditto on the comment about the crowd swallowing you whole
The hostess was friendly and the drinks perfectly fine
the food was good, the wine nice
In other words - we had a nice dinner, but it's not all that
A good mid-week spot
I was expecting it to be a little more swank, but it's very casual
A wonderful bistro that doesn't disappoint, but be prepared to deal with a crush of people that can sometimes be overwhelming and affect your good time
Pastis managed to take some authentic French taste (eg
pastis, olives, bouillabesse,
) and accomodate them in a very busy and lively restaurant and bar
Great service and atmosphere, at reasonable price
A good restaurant where we'll go back
The atmosphere is like Balthazar, great bistro food

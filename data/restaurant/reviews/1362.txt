The food is delicious and they're making some very interestingly delicious rolls
The place: Piccolo reminds me of a tiny little restaurant I once visited in Madrid, with great food served in a dark, warm place with a cavernous ambiance
It's the kind of place you'll always remember and want to return
The service: so friendly and yet so unobtrusive that I almost forgot I was still in New York
The food: delicious
They made a pasta special to my vegetarian taste (without the meatballs) which was the best pasta I've had anywhere in this neighborhood (including all the pricey and noise-filled places over on Park Avenue), and everyone else had theirs with seafood
The only complaint was that we couldn't finish the generous portions
The asparagus appetizer special was amazing
The homemade sorbetto was as good as any I've had in Rome
The expresso: perfect
Bottom line: find a special occasion, or make one up, and go
Piccolo is a tiny restaurant,thats where they got the name from
We were seated at 8:00 sharp,after a few drinks we ordered dinner
The food came out and what a presentation
It looked like those plates of food you would see in a food magazine
It tasted even better than it looked
The service was very good,our waitress Michelle was so talkative and polite,and helpful
I live in Florida and I can t wait to come back
Had dinner here with my wife last week
The space was initimate, good for a romantic meal
We shared a couple of appetizers
For the main course, I had salmon and my wife had the risotto w/ seafood
Both were excellent
The service was very friendly and attentive
I'd recommend Piccolo
I went bold and ordered some of the red sauce[sic]
Bad move
Bland, too sweet and nothing else
The sausage was a saving grace, but it is sausage, i mean come on
My date had a seafood pasta speciality that just made her sick (literally)
The service was low key and unattentive even in a deserted setting
The apparent owner was hitting on a young girl, who seemed to be the restaurant's jester
Really dissapointed and I left the smallest tip of my life
The proscuitto, tomato, mozzarella and basil appetizer was great, but i could have made one of equal or better quality on my own
As for the other food - the entrees, there is no doubt that it is below average
I am surprised that it has such a rating on here
I took a couple friends to Piccolo since we are living in the area and I thought it looked cute
well-decorated, nice open room on the street
So we had a nice dinner
The prix-fixe is a good deal, but the food isn't anything amazing
The pastas were ok, but the gnocchi were very heavy and the pomodoro sauce was sort of strange
it was kind of sweet-tasting and personally, I didn't like it much
Good service though and the decor is quite nice
We found it by accident two years ago and haven't stopped visiting
The room is just lovely and the food and service are excellent
On our last visit a week ago, we thought it would be a light night for diners because is was so miserable and hot
We sat down at 6:30 and by the time we got our entree the place was jammed
We love it
I ate here this past Saturday night with two friends
We ordered the edamame, vegetable gyoza and beef negimaki for appetizers
The edamame was ok - a little salty
The gyoza was falling apart
The beef negimaki was cold, tastless and one of the pieces had what looked to be long scallion shoots sticking up out of it - just blah! The wait staff was friendly, but the ambience and decor was stale and cold
For the same amount of money I could have had delicious food elsewhere
The food here is truly authentic and delicious
Many times with Japanese restaurants, you find the cuisine to be just too American-ized and the Japanese touch is lost
Taka is the exact opposite
The food is truly Japanese and just tasty as can be
From the intricately decorated plates to the elaborate sushi dishes, it is everything a Japanese dinner should be
Although the restaurant is quite small, I found it to be very cozy and a great place to catch up with old friends
It's my favorite Japanese place to eat!!
This used to be one of the best sushi restaurants downtown
But I understand that it has changed ownership recently and I am sorry to say that quality has declined
At one time, there were lines outside the door on busy nights
However, we were there on a Friday recently and the place was less than half full
It would appear that other customers have voted with their feet
Service is pleasant enough and the fish is not bad -- Taka is just not the star it once was
WOW! One can only imagine my surprise when upon my return to NYC I went to Naima for something to eat even though I heard mixed opinions about the restaurant
We were offered to choose from their new summer menu which contained a wonderful combinations of filling yet light and refreshing food and wine
My taste buds were savoring everything I ate saying, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS, DELICIOUS! Now I can confirm that the quality and taste of food in Naima deserves every bit of prize which everyone should enjoy :)
One word explains this place
AWFUL! Everything about this place was horiffic
The service was disgusting and the food was even worse
One of the worst pasta dishes I have ever had
There is nothing good about this place and would never ever recommend it
The waiters did not come over once to see how things are going, appetizers came with dinner and waiters grabbed plates from under our forks
The chairs were uncomfortable and the only reason we noticed was becuase we waited HOURS for our food to come out
Overrated, overpriced and will never ever go back
This place needs to go out of business
This is one of the coolest places that I have been recently in NYC
Im New Yorker and I know how difficult is to find genuine Italian food combined with amazing ambiance
The wine list is well picked with interesting southern Italian wines
The waiter brought me at the table this unfiltered olive oil specially crafted for this restaurant and recommended me buffalo mozzarella that comes every week from Naples and for my main course I had this linguine with orata that blow me out of my mind
I found food to be very light and tasty and the whole experience made feel like I am in Italy
The service was friendly but casual
Check out this restaurant, you will not be disappointed!
We are actually so disappointd then every word on writing an be really considerate offensive to the restaurant
We are refraining our selfs to say more then what it is really necessary
The place looks really good estetically,but the core is pour, lacks of dining room presence, and the service was very disappointing
worst pasta dish I never had in my entire life
the wait staff looks like were doing us a favor giving us service and two loud guys at the bar made my evening with my wife quiet miserable
I eard great things about the place but it turned to be a huge mistake
very pricy menu too!
Wow, is the first thing that come to my mind when you ask me about the Naima
excellent food, wine atmosphere and friendly staff
As soon as we were seated, we have noticed that people are having genuine good time! It did not take us too long to join them
All our questions were answered by the knowledgeable Italian waiter, and according to him the food was prepared and presented to us the way the real Italian cuisine was suppose to be
We ate all our courses, and only the empty plates were going back to the kitchen
Later on the place was transformed with more night crowd coming in for the drinks and DJ spinnin some catchy tunes and creating the lounge party atmosphere
This continued late into the night, with us drinking some of their yummy cocktails, and just enjoying ourselves with the rest of the flirtatious crowd

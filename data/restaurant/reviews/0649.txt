This place was like a breath of fresh air, just what we neaded, the food set it apart from those every day Manhattan Italian restaurants the sevice was friendly and the place had a great comfortable feel
I know we will return many times
I never thought baby goat could taste this good
My only compliant is that the portion is too small
Next time, I'll take a double
Great food and excellent service
Holy geezus, me and my girlfriend went here
i ate my meal, and i tried all of her selections
everything was amazing
I think I could have picked anything from the menu at random and loved it
atmosphere was great
great looking place too
even outside was nice
i creamed myself soon as i tasted the appetizer
and when the bill came for that matter
i highly recommend
you dont leave hungry either, lots of food
THE FOUR OF US WERE COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH THE SPLENDID MENU, VARIETY,PRESENTATION,KNOWLEDGE,SERVICE ON A SAT
NIGHT FOR A NEWRESTAURANT WAS OUTSTANDING
WILL TELL ALL OUR AQUAINTANCES FROM OUT OF TOWN
BEST OF LUCK TO SCOTTY AND ALL WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT
It is not the easiest place in the world to find, but you will be so happy you tried
Executive Chef Scott Conant comes alive with delightful preparations
Fabulous Pastas are mouth watering and made from scratch
The decor, the ambiance, the service and the cuisine make this new hot spot an absolute must visit
Just as a bonus, lets just say the Chef is easy on the eyes
The Scene Christine Snell and husband Chef Will Snell (of Lou Lou in Fort Greene) opened their second country French restaurant, this time in Park Slope
Expertly lit with amber votives and soft, subtle spotlights, the space features a beamed ceiling, wood-planked floor and stained-glass lamps that set the mood for simple, satisfying meals
The clientele runs the gamut, all drawn by rustic French wines and spicy allure of La Bouillabaisse
The Food French foodies can dine on escargots, frog legs and rich foie gras, while an assortment of specials--from whole fish to "chowder of the moment"--keeps things interesting
Beware of occasional over-saucing, over-creaming and over-cheesing: Both the escalopes de veau and steak frites rib eye with sauce Diane could use a lighter hand
Scallops are superb next to scallion mashed potatoes and Bosc pear salad with candied pecans and goat cheese works nicely to start or finish the meal
Dined at Cocotte recently and was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Park Slope
everything we experienced was a delight
Service was attentive and quick ,yet demure , but the real spotlight here deserves to be on the amazing food coming out of the kitchen ! To start was a brilliant asparagus salad with duck prociutto and warm coddled egg in a champagne vinaigrette, that was one of the best expressions of Spring in a long time!
I had the softshell Blue crabs for my entree,they were served with a parsnip/orange puree, sennel braised with saffron, and an ethereal shellfish nage
blew me away! My friend had the Pompano, crispy skin and buttery good, just the way it's supposed to be
for dessert , you can't go wrong with the buttermilk panacotta with rhubarb compote, or the righteous cheesecake
IMHO much better bet than Stone Park ,which I have found to be quite mediocre despite what Citysearch says
Just got in from Cocotte
It's a great restaurant
Service was a little slow, but going on a Monday night during the Brooklyn Restaurant Week, where 20 bucks each got a friend and I appetizer, entree, and dessert was phenomenal
I ordered the salmon which contrary to the previous review, melted in my mouth, a mushroom bisque that was delightfully flavorful, and a caramel flan dessert thing that really topped it off
So good!
We were seated promptly but waited a very long time until someone came for a drink order or give us menus
Very bizarre when it was not a busy night
Servers continuously made mistakes and we were given someone elses food
French Onion soup was not very impressive, luke warm and cheese was not Gruyere
The salmon which I requested medium was well done
The Frites with the steak were cold and kind of soggy
Waiter continuously interupted us to push for dessert
I wouldn't run back there for the average experience unless desperate
Whenever we want to wow some people that love French food, we bring them to Cocotte
We have been there several times and have never had a bad experience
We've even been there as a last resort after having awful service somewhere else and walking out
Each time, the waitstaff at Cocotte has been accommodating and the service and quality of food has been superb
The only thing they could use would be slightly more selections on the menu
I had a horrific experience at Cocotte
The waiter suggested that I get the day's special, which I thought was going to be the classic French beef stew, Pot au Feu
Instead out came out a gray, fatty, dry piece of meat in a watery tasteless broth
Honestly, how can a restaurant serve something like that and call it food? Then when I sent it back, the waiter gave me attitude, like he was shocked that I wasn't going to eat it
To top things off, they charged me for this disgusting piece of meat, and only after arguing with them did they take it off the bill
It's really a shame, because I would have returned despite the bad meat had they been more sensitive to the whole issue
The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, the service is so-so, but the food, alas, is abysmal
DON'T GO THERE
not really all it's cracked up to be
The escargo were leathery and tasteless
I thought the staff was lethargic, but my boy friend thought they were down right  incompetent
mediocre at best
After reading all the reviews I was intrigued, little did I know that the deck was stacked
The service was miserable! That only put the polish on the mediocrity in the kitchen
The only thing that hurt more than paying the bill was the cramps in my stomach that kept me running for the toilet all night
Eat at your own risk
They now have a bar in the rear garage which has about as much ambiance as a crypt
I think that parkslope demands more then bare cinder block walls as decor
The food lacked the kind of praise this place had received
We found the wine list to be a disappointment and although the service and the ambience were pleasant, if you are looking for a place to wow you with their culinary skills, move on to another Brooklyn establishment
My friends and I eat at Cocotte on a regular basis
The food is always amazing, the atmosphere is welcoming, and the service is top-notch, not to mention the burgers are to die for!!!
I really enjoyed Cocotte's cuisine, wine and ambiance
Menu is creative and food is simply delicious
Great place to go for a romantic evening or with a group of friends
On top of it all, the service is excellent!
Highly recommended for intimate, neighbourhood dining; for a quiet (and inexpensive) night out
Great room - lots of exposed brick wood, nicely lit
candles
Absolutely packed on a Monday night (Dine-in-Brooklyn restaurant week; 1 hour wait at 8 PM)
Despite the crowd, though, both the food and the service were excellent
The salad was fresh; the vinaigrette nicely done
The hangar steak was perfectly cooked (rare=rare) and the accompanying veggies were not overcooked
The profiterolles, while not the decadent chocolate affair I'd had in Paris, was very delicate and the flavours interesting
Interesting wine list and they had some wine/cheese tasting selections that I look forward to trying
Was pleased to see that even without the special promotion, they have a $19 prix fixe during the week
Will definitely return (and make a reservation)
The hangar steak and crepe prix fixe dinner tonight was marvelous
The waitress (tanya) was very pleasant and attentive
It was noisy and crowded because of the good turnout for the dine in Brooklyn Special but on Monday nights
we will return because they let you bring you own wine to diner - with no corkage fee
That is a marvelous deal
The food was sublime

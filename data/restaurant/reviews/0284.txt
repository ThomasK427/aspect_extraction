there was also some pretty cool stuff around with the decor
and free jest magazine by the bathrooms
We recently visited Madiba for lunch, and our waitress was sweet but ineffective
It took us forever just to get menus, drinks had to be begged for to arrive, and food was WAY overpriced, but tasty
Madiba has an open kitchen layout, which means the dishwashing machine is never to far from where you are sitting
The waitress had the gall to ask us to close out our check when she brought our food so she could go home rather than wait for us to finish (hey babe we waited for YOU, you can wait for US)
The authentic South African side dishes were great, and we enjoyed trying something new
But I don't think we will go back
We had a reservation for 8:30PM for 4
After waiting for an hour, the owner offered us a free round of drinks, but forgot to actually deliver them
Our entrees were served to us at 11:00PM
This was my second time at this restuarant, and both times were disappointing
I really want to like this place, but my advice is stay away until they get their act together
if ever
I've been there twice now and each time the food and atmosphere have been delightful
Although, the first time was probably the better of the two times, because the special of the day was an whole whiting the size of the plate doused in amazing flavors
I would also highly recommend the bread pudding for dessert
Although, the prices may be considered to be on the steep end--especially in the neighborhood--it is a nice place for a quiet, homestyle dinner on a Sunday night
as the south africans would say
The space itself is great: the shebeen vibe and cocktails are very creative and enjoyable and convey a sense of theater, but drinks are drastically overpriced for Ft
Greene
Also, the food is essentially peasant food-style dishes of the various ethnicities of SA, but is priced like dinner at Pastis
The food is just okay and I suppose novel, but it's basically good street cart food
For these prices it's just absurd
Also, I've found the staff to be incompetent on many occasions, and worse, totally aloof and unapolagetic for the multitude of screw ups one encounters there
If they lowered the prices by 25% and got some decent help, It'd be a fair value and a fun experience, instead you leave feeling ripped off
When we first moved into the neighborhood several years ago, Madiba was better priced and more relaxed
Now, you go in there and on top of a $75 dinner for two (including drinks and tip), they make you pay $5 per person for the music
Isn't my $75 enough? I think its in really poor taste to charge a cover for the music when you are going there to have a nice dinner and spend significant money - come on - this is Brooklyn!  I have to say Mojitos and other fun drinks are the best around
Madiba has a original decor, if a bit flamboyant, and a nice vibe about it
It has all the good things about dining out in Brooklyn (no fuss, no red rope policy, seating space always available, a neighborhood feeling about it) but at a Manhattan price: dinner for two comes around $50 each
Ouch! The cocktail drinks the best the place has to offer: caipirinhas, caipiroskas, and mojitos, served in large glass jars with friut bits
Try the Durban samoosas, avoid the ostrich carpaccio
Most main courses are pretty spicy, so be prepared! Try the bobotie, or the prawns, and the bunny chow
The service was unexplicably slow, considering that the place was almost empty
Also, they had a singer that night, which made conversation over dinner basically impossible
Will I come back again? Probably: more to enjoy a nice caipirinha outdoor in the Summer than for the food, though
Madiba is one place I make sure to take visitors
The decor is unusual and ecclectic, the food is generously proportioned and arrives quickly
The cocktail are strong and large (although a bit expensive)
And, the staff is FANTASTIC - friendly and for the most part, from the neighborhood!
In some ways Madibaechoes some of the woes of other neighborhood restaurants in that the service can be a bit too relaxed at times but the energy and liveliness more than make up for it plus a warm smile goes a long way with me! It's a great place to go with a group of friends whether you stop in for an after-work cocktail (the rum punch is divine) or a full meal
The menu is eclectic with something for just about everyone
I'd also recommend a visit on Mondays for Carribean Night when the menu selections have an island twist to them and live bands set up inside
All in all I'd say that if you're in a hurry for a quick and efficient meal you might be happier elsewhere but if you enjoy a leisure meal in a very friendly atmosphere then you'll probably be hooked
I'm a bit mysitfied by all the squabbling below
There's nothing about Madiba to get so excited about
Madiba is a perfectly adequate, middling restaurant in a nice neighborhood with a decent ambience and a loyal clientele
I can't vouch for whether this place represents the authentic tastes of home longed for by transplanted ex-pats, but the food I had was fine, if somewhat over-priced
You can do better for less money at various places up the block (notably Liquors and Lou-Lou) but if the exoticism appeals to you, you'll probably enjoy yourself
That said, this ought not be a destination restaurant
If you're in the neighborhood (or really bored on a Friday night) fine, but otherwise, try something that will actually be worth the trip
I did think it quaint that the waitress referred to my date as 'Mama
'
I too am a native South African and have to say that this food is nothing like the real thing
The dishes were bland, badly prepared and does not remotely taste like my mother's cooking
I have eaten almost every dish on that menu back in South Africa and Madibas is really not representative of SA food
These are amateur chefs, cashing in on the President's fame
It's a lekker jol though
My boyfriend and I went to Boxers for Brunch
We were brusquely seated by a male manager who may be the owner
We then witnessed this man verbally abuse and browbeat ALL his predominately female employees
He was over 6 foot and was invading the body space of his tiny employees in a disturbing way
The waitresses were all like deer in the headlights with frozen scared looks on their faces
He did this not 2 feet from our table
My ex Navy boyfriend wanted to step in, but I restrained him because I was worried that this man was so mentally unhinged it would further endanger the employees
I first walked through these doors in 1982
It has always been a wonderful, centerly located bar where you could meet friends at any hour
Sunday I ordered a chicken sandwich ($8
75 ?)
it was good and Jack daniels on the rocks
it was delivered in a small rock glass crammed with ice and a little whiskey
$9
00!! Other places have started charging in this range but at least you get a good pour
so three dinks at Boxers is now $27
00
if they are trying to make there moneuy on the liquor
thye just lost it
This place is a great addition to a weekend Sunday afternoon -- with a great $13 deal that includes a brunch entree + 2 alcoholic brunch beverages
The great (attractive) wait staff is coupled with a fab interior
Happy hour is fun as well, good deals and good drinks
One so-so aspect of the place is the filthy bathroom
Perhaps it was just an off-day, but thankfully I went AFTER my meal
went to boxers w/some friends for thanksgiving
it was great! the food was great, the drink prices were reasonable the atmosphere was great
I plan on going again again
Pride weekend was topped off by a visit to this great place to watch the scene in the gay capital of the world! We'll be back
A gayish irish bar
What a find! The food was just fair, but we still had a ball!
Yes, don't form your impression based on the bad reviews
I've always had a nice experience at Barney Mac's, whetehr it's for happy hour drinks, dinner, or the brunch, which is a great deal good food
We had so much fun, lots of beers on tab, great pasta in a down to earth spot in the village
The bartenderr was funny and we met lots of nice people
It reminded us a lot of some of the great pubs in London
The Scene This sleek Asian lounge entices with soft lighting, sea-blue walls and niches filled with art and artifacts
An oblong bar dominates the lounge in front, where the welcoming owners keep the sake and liquor flowing
A laughing Buddha separates the bar-lounge from the comfortable, matter-of-fact dining area in back
The Food The kitchen here whips up ample, greaseless portions of Asian tapas and dim sum for a mixed crowd
Preparations are minimalist and delicately flavored
Salt-dusted Atlantic salmon comes infused with lemongrass and ginger; aromatic Chilean sea bass and monkfish are succulent inside and seared on top

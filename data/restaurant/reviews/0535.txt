We sprung 7 people on them, plus a Seeing Eye Dog! Still they accommodated us, and were friendly to boot! The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating
Other seafood dishes were very good (NO COMPLAINTS FROM ANYONE!)
Deserts were terriffic
The $300 bill was a bit steep, but the experience was great
--Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons
To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food
Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring
Fish was overdone
Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that
One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment
I went to mare with 4 of my girlfriends
we weren't very hungry so we only ordered wine and 3 appeitzers
nonetheless, our friendly waiter threw in a free calamari starter
The appetizers were the size of most main course seafood entrees in new york, making this a great value, and they were delicious and very elegantly presented! (i also the main dishes others were being served
HUGE!) My friends were convinced they were some of the best crab cakes they've ever had! Go check it out and you won't be sorry!
We went here on a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad we did
Not only was the seafood fresh and tasty(we had oysters lobster) but the staff was very friendly
This was a very nice surprise that will definitely be on our come back again list
My companion and I ate here this evening and we do regret paying for the meal! The fried oysters were terrible, the octopus salad was too tough, the mahi mahi and salmon were cooked so as not to be able to be recognized
Even salt and fresh lemon could not bring this meal back to life
The staff, while not attentive at first, was very pleasant and cheerful after the appetizers
The cheescake, tartuffo and lattes were very good, though
maybe this restaurant should become a dessert place, lol !!!
I was pessimistic about Mare, but a friend chose it and she's usually right on, so I ventured over
Sat outside (great place to people watch) and started with some clams which were out of this world
At that time I watched as a black pick up truck pulled up, opened it back and dumped out a tuna the size of a small child
Packed in ice, the tuna came off the truck and was seared and on my plate within 15 minutes
My server pushed the sesame/soy/ginger glaze, but was more than accomodating to my request of some olive oil and nothing else
You can just imagine how good/fresh the tuna was
The only way it could have been fresher is if I caught it myself and ate it on the boat
Mare, made a beliver out of me
Nothing special to look at, but man what a dinner
A nice, moderately priced, local seafood joint in Chelsea
The food is solid and the rawbar, especially the oysters, is excellent
The service is very friendly and accomodating
One of our diners didn't like her fish and both the waitress and the manager insisted on replacing it
Sitting on the sidewalk on a nice day/evening you can see all of thriving Chelsea walk by you, not a bad way to spend a meal
I had a fabulous lunch one summer afternoon at Mare, at a table in the sun
The service was good, the ambience was better and the food was fantastic
I've since been to Mare 3 times, and have enjoyed each visit
Whenever I feel like having some fresh oysters or lobster I come to the Mare
In my mind this is the only place specialized in fresh seafood in the city
If you are looking for other food than the fresh seafood you may want to try a different place
Last time I had the Dungeness crab with half dozen of West Coat oysters and a grilled Mediterranean fish which can't remember the name of it but I sure remember the great taste
I would just go there for the dozen oysters and couple of bottles of beer before a movie or even a dinner
Have Fun!
I stumbled upon this place on my way to rehearsal
I sat at the raw bar and had a dozen little neck clams and a beer
The atmosphere is cool, the staff was very friendly and the clams were good
Nice and cold! The only caveat is the price
My bill came out to $25 for the snack
But I enjoyed it so I plan to go back and have a meal there
Some of the entress on the menu looked very enticing
Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint, food was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt
A nice space, as long as it doesn't get too crowded and a singleminded devotion to its chosen cuisine make Mare a great choice for seafood lovers
Maria Pia's food is delicious! The cavetelli bolognese was amazing
The pasta was perfectly cooked and the meat sauce was rich and favorful
The food tastes just like my what my Mom and Grandma used to make - earthy and authentic Italian
We were served promptly and the wait staff was very nice
I highly recommend this little jem of a resturant
Dined here on Saturday 1/28/06 before the Theater
Reservations were for 6:30 and we arrived 15 minutes early
We were seated immediately, even though the place was packed
There is a 3 course Prix Fixe menu for $21
95 or you can order off the regular menu
Food was great, service was prompt
Seating is a little cramped, but that is the norm for a restaurant of this type in the Theater District
We had a reservation for two but were told to wait at the bar
We each ordered a glass of wine, paid for them and waited 15 minutes to be seated
Once seated, we waited another 20 minutes in the busy restaurant without a server acknowledging our presence
We figured that although the menu looked good, it wasn't worth fighting to eat there
As we left without getting to order, we told the hostess what had happened, and all she could manage was an unapologetic sorry
I love Maria Pia's food, really Italian
really yummy! Unfortunately, the service is not at the same level of the food:-/ Last time I was there the bathrooms were not working, and my chair was broken
I complained to the manager, (his name is Mary
weird) and he didn't care AT ALL, and gave me a cold and rude answer
and it was not the first time dear Mary!!!  The wait stuff is attentive though, the bartender was really nice and competent (her name is Jo
jaja a little gender confusion here) and the Maitre D' was a real HOT Italian model :-O  Overall: WORTH TO TRY!
When I was looking for this restaurant, I was distraught by the appearance of the street
But the moment I step down the stairs to Maria Pia, I forgot the ungliness of the street and was transformed to a delightful place
My friends and I were lucky enough to snatch the only four tops out in the little patio space
The food was absolutely YUMMY
The price was so cheap for the quality and quanity
Definately try the crab cake and Calamari Fritti for appetizer and the Shrimp and Scallop for Entree
My daughter and I were delighted with this find
Everything about it was really nice
We sat down and immediately reached for the candles just to see each other the table was so dark
Now I know dark is romantic, but this was rediculous
My seat was directly under the heat and it was about 150 degrees
I asked the waiter if they could turn the heat down a bit
He said they couldn't, but we could switch tables
He brought us to the table right next to the kitchen, despite many other open tables
He could tell he didn't want to hear the cooks conversations, so he sat us next to the basement stairs, and luckily I was on the outside so I was the only one that had to smell the odor from downstairs (those of you that have worked in a restaraunt know what I mean)
But, overall, the food was good, the prices great, just need to work on the service
We were going to go a few doors down to Vice Versa but got turned off by the crowd and how crowded it looked
We were in the mood for something more quiet and low key and went to Maria Pia
The menu sounds average, like you can find these dishes anywhere

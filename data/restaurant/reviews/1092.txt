Just don't expect great quality service as the wait staff doubles at the counter
I go to this restaurant quite often because I never had a meal I didn't like! It gets very busy on the weekends, causing the service to be a bit on the slow side, but the staff is usually kind and the food is wonderful
a little pricey, but I think it's worth it
The firehouse rolls are the best!
I went there on a Sunday night, first thing through the door (after being seated)
We were approached by a VERY rude manager/waiter informing us that the restaurant was closing at 10 and basically that we were unwanted business
The sushi was sub-par at best
In fact, for the nearly $100 bill that came promptly after our salad was taken away, was definitely not worth it at all
I would HIGHLY recommend any other sushi restaurant on SI
In the quickly developing neighborhood of the Off 3rd Ave
Bridge area in the Bronx, sources of entertainment are still sparse
But this bar is surely one of the first establishments to set the tone for the sexy and urban neighborhood this is to become in the next few years
Somewhat reminiscent of rustic pubs with that good ol' feel in the South Street Seaport or the DUMBO area, the dark-wood interior is moody and sensual
The front room is great for a casual dining, and in the huge back room, you can shoot pool with a drink in hand under extra high ceilings
I was at Zutto's the other evening with friends
The food was quite good, while the service was quite terrible
We had to ask for everything, from plates to water, soy sauce, etc
What really made it bad was the ATTITUDE of the waitress
You probably could get away with it in Manhattan, maybe, but not in Great Neck
We were part of a Rotary group and I would never come back again
We were there for your ribbon cutting
Get rid of help that is impolite
Took my girlfriend out
We sat on the patio without many other people there to bother us
The menu was quite expansive, and everything we ordered was great
Sumbled into this place about two months ago
Don't know why we never went
The food is delicious
Nothing fancy, just diner type fare but done very well
The staff is always friendly
We are now regulars
We get breakfast there at least once a week, and ocassionally dinner too
This place has the best desserts/baked goods around! I frequently come here, and have tried a variety of things from the Raspberry Mousse to the baklava to the bougatsa to the spinach pie and even the bread
and its all phenomenal
The desserts look as good as they taste
The staff is very patient and helpful
The Scene Gradations of red and orange spread across the dimly lit walls, curved tile bar, and corduroy booths, which set the tone for an intimate and sleek dining experience
Well-dressed groups of 30-somethings and couples converse quietly as the small, friendly staff wanders through the restaurant
The Food The restaurant's French menu is littered with foreign influences
Start with the Ecuadorian shrimp seviche in a tomato-based marinade, which is light on acidity but high on the sweet taste of mango
Move on to the classic tarte flambee, a light, crispy pizza-like dish topped with onions and piles of crumbly bacon
The special black cod is served in an asparagus cream sauce--the tender slivers of fish accompanied by a slightly salty mix of shiitake mushrooms and fava beans
Finish with the molten chocolate cake, which houses an oozing core of chocolate in a moist cake shell
We love this place
The food is outstanding
And it's just the right combination of hip, classic, chic and friendly
After 3 visits we've never had a disappointing dish
The chef puts together some inspired combinations
GO TO THIS RESTAURANT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
ambience, color, music and specialy drinks and food
so much fun, sexy waitress  very good for astoria  keep going
Went with the wife to the old neighborhood for night out
Had a great meal and a better date
Food was outstanding, deset was even better! Gets a little crowded but the ambience was, well
lets just say I haven't had a date like that in a long time!!! Highly recomended!!
My husband and I have gone to 718 twice now for their weekend brunch
The food is excellent
Don't miss the french toast or the calamari
And the prix fixe price can't be beat
The decor is beautiful and the staff is attentive
You won't be disappointed
Fatty's is a great restaurant! The staff is really friendly
My fiance loves the salmon burger, which is made fresh everyday, while I am partial to the fabulous skirt steak
They change the the artwork in the walls regularly, sometimes it is really nice, sometimes it is really
interesting :-) If you find yourself in Astoria you should definitely give it a try! Their $10 weekend brunch is worth the (short) train ride!
I actually went to Fatty's recently and they were not sooo friendly
They were absolutely obnoxious and not welcoming to me and my guests
I will definitely think twice about where I take my out-of-town guests in future
Its not like we are in Manhattan its Queens get rid of the big city attitude
Ohhh and its not like your chef is Jean George either
Fattys is easily one of the best restaurants in NYC
The food is incredible - I'm very particular to their brunch specials - and ther ambience is always cool
The staff are very friendly and attentive
During the summer a back patio opens up and you can sit outside and enjoy your meal
If you're in Astoria for brunch or dinner, definitely try this great place!!
That's what the very cute Irish waiter told me last time I was there
And he could quite possibly be right
They're soo good
The food is amazing, too
Go for brunch - it's the best value on the menu
My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on Saturday evening
There was only one other couple inside, but there seemed to be a lot of people sitting outside somewhere
the food was very good and average priced
Excellent Mojitos!!! This place is a little gem in Astorie that any local should visit on a regular basis
A friend and I recently went to Fatty's Cafe for an early dinner based on the review in Time Out New York
Even though there was a Christening that had reserved the restaurant, the waiter told us we could sit in the patio area and wait until it was over for service to resume
He even let us order drinks - quite possibly the most delicious mojito I've ever had
We split the Jalapeno Turkey Burger and the Cubano with a side order of Tostones and all three were fantastic
I'm definately going back soon!
The food is fabulous, the service is great, and its a great value! If you're in or around Astoria Saturday or Sunday late morning, then stop in for brunch
The polenta corn cakes and pancake omlette are fantastic!
A really cozy place, where you can either come with friends or your a loved one
Good food, great and friendly service
Great value for your money
Astoria should have more of these
Fatty's is great for Astoria because it adds a bit of a creative, artsy Williamsburg vibe to a neighborhood otherwise lacking in that type of flavor
They serve wonderful mango mimosas and spicy chipotle bloody marys for brunch, with creative selections like fruit-filled pancake omelettes or melted provolone sandwiched between two polenta cakes
For dinner, they offer similarly interesting options, with a slight Latin tendency
The entree salads are small, though, albeit very good
Excellent selection of bottled beers, plus $5 Tecates-and-shots of tequila

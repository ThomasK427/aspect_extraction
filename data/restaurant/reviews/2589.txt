There's a palpable electricity in the air of this histrionic hangout, heightened by the close confines of the understated main space
The Food Unfortunately, the food is less animated; the kitchen seems to be reading the right lines, but with the wrong attitude
Signature thin pizzas are oily and dull, and starters like baked artichoke filled with white bean salad are a yawn
You can still find some compelling pastas, like pappardelle with earthy lamb stew and zesty perciatelle alla matriciana (with pancetta, tomatoes and hot pepper)
Seafood entrees are well executed, but poultry is a roll of the dice
Desserts are okay, nothing more
From the minute we walked into the restaurant we received nothing but an obnoxious attitude from the staff
The food choices were limited - only one type of soup available
If you enjoy eating like a pig, this is the place for you
We asked for bread plates when the bread was brought to the table and the server's response was management has decided not to offer bread plates
What??? The food was mediocre and overpriced
You could do so much better with your money
Not recommended!
My boyfriend took me after a matinee, and we had the most wonderful time
Reservations should be made well in advance because it is small, but it is definately worth it
Romantic atmosphere and fantastic food
My boyfriend had the most delicious pizza ever
Ditto to heidipeterson! I think we had the same server
Food was so-so
we were hesitate whether we needed to pour our own wine since that was new to us
The host and our server had attitude problems and I was tempted to give them no tip! I don't see any reason to go there when there are so many other options in the city
Our server at Orso was a pretentious jerk! He seemed irritated with us from the start, and never smiled once
He came across as being very snotty
However, I am not sure why, considering the fact that he had a pencil behind his ear and dressed very casually, you would think we would have been at a Dennys
We also had to poor our own wine, and once the food finally came, he never checked on us once! They had a place on the check for a Captains tip, which seemed ridiculous because this was not a very fancy restaurant
The fact that there are plenty of wonderful restaurants in New York City to choose from, you would think they would try harder to please their customers I wouldn't waste your money here
Noisy, limited menu, poor winelist, no decor- and difficult to get a reservation
Orso must do a big business with first-time customers
My first and LAST visit included a waiter telling me We're casual- pour your own wine and then handing me a check with a place for the Captain's tip
There is nothing about Orso that would give you a reason to try it
Reservations are needed weeks in advance- for what I wonder? The food was okay, nothing outstanding, but fine for the price
The service is another story
We had probably the most obnoxious waiter in all NY
When I questioned him about our wine choice he actually criticized me for not knowing the difference between the type and the region
When he brought the bottle to the table, he placed it in the center without pouring a glass and walked away
The food and service were wonderful
My mushroom ravioli in nutmeg cream sauce was perfect -- exactly the right touch of nutmeg
My dinner companions also enjoyed their chicken and veal dishes
Since they change their menu daily, based on what's good at the market, the mushroom ravioi was not on the menu on my next visit but the food was just as good
I found the service to be friendly and attentive, without being obtrusive
When I returned a week after my first visit they remembered me and my guests
I will be sure to return every time I am in NYC
Although the food LOOKS OK - and actually looks appetizing, it is bland and tasteless
Worst of all it is extremely pricey
I tried it for both breakfast and lunch - because it is close to my office - and both times I was disappointed in the quality of the food
Warning! Pass over this one for morning bagels
they don't have a toaster (!), and they give cream cheese in those little plastic cups
The street vendor outside is much tastier
Who needs this in the morning?!? Get with the program, Cafe Europa
La Paloma is my favorite neighborhood take out place
It has great huge burritos for a terrific price
The service is quick and friendly
The dining area is small, but not bad if you're in a hurry
Great Mexican fare, reminds of the more authentic style I'd get when I lived in Tuscon, AZ
Great value, great portions
It's more of a take out place as there's little seating and not much ambiance
Their burritos resemble the fresh, california style and are by far the best I've had in New York
From the tacos to the salsa to the burritors, this is the best peasant mexican food I've found
This place serves up large portions of excellent tex-mex food
This is a weekly regular place for takeout for me
The price is extremely affordable too
Make sure to try the flan!
I just had dinner at this place and I am hoping it stays with me through the night
The place was just plain dirty
forks, knives and even my wine glass were grimey
they did not feel clean to the touch so no telling what bacteria/germs I just ingested
The menus were so grimey and greasy I had to go wash my hands
The bruschetta was aweful
not what you normally expect
the tomatoes were soggy with some vinegar sauce that was gross and the bread was old and smelled funny
The pasta was good
I just hope the plate was cleaned that it was on! The service was terrible
slow, slow, slow! I felt sorry for the waiter
while he was very nice
not sure if he was overwhelmed or just not cut out for this profession
I believe it was the latter
Our order was messed up
and dessert never came, so we just got the check and left
We chose this place as we had been walking all day and our feet hurt
we should have endured the pain and gone another block to somewhere else
The service at this resturaunt is terrible
I have heard the food is good but it is certainly not worth dealing with the staff
This is what every neighborhood needs - a good solid Italian restaurant with no pretensions
The pizza is thin and crispy with fresh ingredients; the fettucine pasta with chicken and spinach in garlic and olive oil was simple and perfect
The bread wasn't great, but with the portion sizes, we didn't need it anyway
Service was fast and friendly
This is my new neighborhood italian eatery!
The food here is great, especially the brick oven pizza
Reasonably priced and it's a nice cozy atmosphere
The food here was terrible
The bruschetta was chewy, dry and the sauce on the tomatoes was nauseating
The fettucuni with spinach, feta and garlic looked like the cook just dumped a can of spinich on top with a couple handfuls of feta and huge chunks of garlic
The most unpleasant meal I have ever eaten
I would have to say that their pizza looked really good, though I would steer clear of everything else on the menu
The Food is GREAT and very very weell priced
When ever I feel like good Italian food I stop by
The Don Giovianni Speical Pasta is out of this world
In Short Butcher paper covers the tables and Broadway memorabilia cover the exposed brick walls at this Theater District favorite
In warm weather, cool breezes drift in from the open doors that face 46th Street
On the menu, reliable American tavern fare mixes with choices like a spicy Portuguese blood sausage, Greek salad, grilled portabello mushroom and quesadillas

(who knew I would like Swedish food so much?)
The brunch deals are reasonable and I think the bright yellow coloring of the walls makes it feel incredibly warm and inviting
I would highly recommend this place
Everything was just wonderful
The service was attentive and fun and the food great!- Loved the seafood salad, and the spiced vanilla mohito hit the spot after a long day
Can't wait to go back!
are to die for
This was the best meal I've had in a restaurant in a long time
Everything on the menu is fabulous
It's a very nice and cozy restaurant and the service is good
All the waiters were exceptionally nice
Highly recommend it
This place makes a nice swedish omelette
For those that don't know what this is, you should go there
They also had some traditional home fries which are baked and not fried
Good place for a Sunday afternoon after a nite of boozin
If you are a ketchup lover like myself, they don't really have it here
I'm not sure if it's b/c the Swedes don't use it, or they just didn't have any left
I got it in a little plastic Mc D's cup
Also they aren't big coffee drinkers but the coffee they have is good and 3 bucks a cup
b/c it's organic
Never heard of organic coffee beans
I work on Wall Street and always love going to Smorgas Chef down there
I'm very excited to now have a Smorgas Chef right here -- a block away from where I live in Midtown
Same great food, but even better ambiance
Although service was a bit disorganized (I went the day after they opened), the servers were very attentive and friendly
Love the new wine and cocktail list!
Being from one of the Scandinavian countries I grew up eating meatballs and herring almost daily so I was excited to try out this place but unfortunately I was really disappointed
The meatballs both tasted and looked like cheap ready-made frozen meatballs and they had that odd, gummy texture
Not only was the food downright bad but it was really pricey too
I guess I have been spoilt by places like the AQ cafe in the Scandinaviahouse where you get a phenomenal homemade smorgasplate for the same price
Once you walk in, it looks like a big dining room in a mansion
I really like the decor and it made it feel like I was having drinks at a mansion
The music is very mixed, Irish, Rock, Hip Hop, Techno, Pop
The drinks are pretty cheap where most pints are $5
The crowd is mixed, mostly Irish
on weekdays, sit back and enjoy watching the New York Mets on their plasmas! The bartender Nick on weekends is real cool and can carry any type of conversation
I enjoy coming here every weekend
I'm a big fan of Thai noodle
This is my first time here in Songkran
The atmosphere is nice and relax
Food here is fantastic especially Pad Thai noodle and Coconut Noodle
In my opinion is best Pad Thai in Town
Also have a wonderful cocktail
Next time I will come back for dinner special with my friend
The location on St
Marks is really tiny and cramped but it is sooooo worth it
The hummus us amazing and they give you a pretty big portion at a very inexpensive price
One order comes with 2 fresh, decent sized, warm pita breads
There are only like 3-4 things on the menu - however, they are all perfection
I never cared much about hummus until trying this place
It's exceedingly inexpensive and, despite being on St
Mark's Place, clean and elegant
The menu is simple and everything is delicious, especially the warm hummus foul
The pita bread is delicious
It's so affordable that I eat there all the time
Best value for under $10! DELICIOUS!! I'm hooked, eat here all the time
The menu is short - cosists of 3 types of hummus (try the combo plate of 3), a soup an awesome salad
They don't serve alchohol but you can bring your own
Their pita is freshly baked and tastes fantastic
Two can easily share one plate (for $5), but if you're starving you can have your own you'll be stuffed
The location in EVillage is bigger, with a back room, but the place in McDougal is very accomidating has great service
MUST TRY - you will not be dissapointed!
This hummus is creamy, flavorful, and just right for a lunch or dinner
The pita bread served with the hummus is warm and soft and a perfect way to scoop up the hummus
Either the foul hummus or the masabacha is great and topped with a hard boiled egg
In addition, the restaurant includes traditional green hot sauce, onion, pickles, and olives with each order
Try the special for less than $10
You'll leave feeling stuffed AND satisifed!
There is NO OTHER place in the city that serves such high quality Hummus plates for such a low price! They have 5 or so different plates on the menu for $5 and a great $2
50 hummus sandwich that is amazing
They add egg, tahini, whole chick peas and all sorts of delicious magic into their hummus creations and serve them to you at the cheapest prices you will find! I come here all the time and love it! It's a cute little restaurant with only 7 or 8, two person tables, but they use their space nicely and it's well decorated so you can actually have a quality meal their with someone
Go now and enjoy!
This is the best Middle Easter fast food joint I've been to
It's very clean, the food is made from high quality ingredients, and the service is friendly
You can take out or eat in, and the prices are quite reasonable
You can also visit the other branch at 20 John St
in the financial district which is even better IMHO
What a lovely place Alexandra and Vito created
After having had many dinners at Aroma previously,I organized to have my sister's birthday there (she flew in from LA)
Vito actually baked a chocolate cake for her, which they presented after a wondefully inventive dinner
Their wine selection is so vast and unique that you have to ask for help, if you dont have a PhD in Wne
Their menu is held on a small scale to be able to perfect every dish, which they manage just fin
My favorites are the lamb, the monkfish and everything else on the menu ;-) Cheers to many more visits!
This probably one of the friendliest place i know in NY
The food is excellent prices are good and the service is ultra attentive, the wine list is a delight
Best value for money in my book
A feel good place
Try it for a glass of wine stay the whole night that s what I did
And I ll do it again
We discovered Aroma by chance on a Sunday night
We were warmly welcomed - it quickly felt like we were visiting friends
Once comfortably seated we were told that they offer a special menu on Sundays that is more relaxed and casual than the rest of the week
And it's a bargain at 3 courses for $25 with great choices for each course
I didn't feel like eating 3 courses and that was fine too plus they have additional items off the prix fixe menu
The wine list is impressive with great choices at all price levels and a huge selection of half bottles
We loved everything we ate from the fresh organic mesclun salad to the meatballs and the monkfish with a delicious sardinian pasta in a light lobster broth
We also discovered a new wine that is now one of our favorites
To make the night perfect, we were pleasantly surprised by a guitarist playing soothing melodies
Truly a wonderful way to relax and rejuvenate before the work week ahead

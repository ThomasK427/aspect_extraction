Nice selection of wine by the glass, good service, nice design
but the place was too loud (pretty good selection of music, though)
I guess the place is for drinking and socializing more than eating
We left before dessert so that we could talk without shouting
From the moment we walked in the front door it was a disaster
The hostess was confussed and all over the place
The restaurant wasn't even at full capacity
The waitress was not at all familiar with either the wine list or the food menu
She couldn't explain in detail any of the dishes
At this point we were concerned so we decided to only order appetizers to see how that went prior to ordering any entrees
Well, needless to say we left after the appetizers and will not return again
Arrive early to take advantage of the eclectic drinks at the bar
of course the people watching is stellar (Philip Seymore Hoffman was there)
Skip the rice paper rolls; they were a little light on substance
We ordered the Miso Braised short ribs as an app
and they were the best I have ever tasted; pefectly tender and so succulent
Would go back just for these delectable little numbers
The favorite entree of the night was the Cod with mushrooms, with the Monkfish with lobster butter as a close second
The service was impeccable
To cap off the night, the waiter brought us an entire cookie sheet of freshly baked (HOT) chocolate chip cookies
His tip went up
I discovered Sapa around the holdiays and have been back three times since
The food is truly excellent, good wine selection, and I actually found some of the specialty cocktails quite tasty, though the alcohol content was a little low
I would recommend this place for a party of four or more, however, not the best place for just two people, and I find the crowd better on a weeknight than on teh weekend
We had our executive team dinner at Sapa and everyone is still raving about that night
The food and ambiance and service was outstanding
We highly recommend Sapa and intend on going back soon
This is now our new favorite restaurant in NYC
This restaurant is excellent -- the food, the ambience, the service -- all perfect 10's! I recommend the price fixe menu with the wine pairing
it's very tasty and a great value!
Arrived with a few friends for a birthday celebration and experienced one of the fatest meals on the planet
Rushed is a mild word
It was like being on the NY-DC shuttle, a flight where the meal is served, cleaned up and seat backs are put in the upright position for landing all in swift few minutes
There was obviously no line of people waiting for tables and in fact there were empty tables
So I'm not sure what the rush was
To top it off the waiter was distant, scattered and completely mis-timed the meal
We walked away saying what a paradox - great food, lousy service
It really ruined our celebration
Truly lousy service and served with an attitude
If you can stand being treated like this, the food is worth tasting
Maybe they have take-out
the resturant is romantic decor yet good for groups, food average but he drinks are great
service was excellent
the place is gorgeous and large, but still feels cozy
the staff was very accomodating and friendly, the drinks are good
but the menu is pretty small
the salads were a bit too funky for me to order, the rolls were okay not great, but the cod was delicious and so was the steak
yumm
overall recommended
great atmosphere, great entrees
just a few to choose from~
Drinks:  If it doesn't come in a ready-to-serve bottle, don't order it
Had a martini and it was TRULY AWFUL
it really is the worst drink I have ever had; even the cough-syrup tasting club drinks were better than this!  Food:  Presentation is nice and the food tastes good
It was not extraordinary by any mean, but it tastes good
However for the price, I was really expecting something that blows me away
Dessert:  Selection was somewhat limited and it's not the same menu that they show on their website
I would rate the dessert average to below-average as we couldn't finish any of it
This is a great restaurant for anyone of any age
I had dinner with a 20 something, a 50 something and a 40 something and they all loved the food and the decor
Everyone said they plan to return with others to showcase the place
Food was very unique and very tasty
The pork dish wasn't so great because it was a bit too fatty, but the bass, tuna, and duck were superb
We ordered all of the appetizers and we loved all of them
Desserts were wonderful, too
And they had a very good wine list, too
THIS IS A GREAT RESTAURANT WITH AN AWESOME AND COOL ATMOSPHERE! I HAD A ROBERTO CAVALLI VODKA WITH CAVIAR AND IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY! FOOD WAS VERY GOOD
GREAT PLACE TO CELEBRATE GREAT MOMENTS!
I have been to Sapa numerous times since its inception over a year ago
The presentation taste of the food is wonderful
Some of my favorites off the menu include the beef satay, Asian chopped salad and more
The staff is always polite and the owner, Brian is a great guy who keeps a watchful eye on his diners to make sure they have a positive dining experience
why i havent been frequenting this place more, i am not sure
this was my second time dining at sapa, and i swear it just gets better
i love the happy hour, nothing like a good cocktail in non-divey place for after work
the staff was really great, knew what they were talking about and very friendly
not too sound crazy, but very cheers like, it has that inviting feel that just lets you be yourself! the soup was really nice on these cold winter nights, and the steamed fish was fabulous
very light but extremely flavorful
lastly, the desserts were fabulous, they have a new party chef and that makes me very happy!
This is it caviar and cavalli vodka
A little pricey but perfect for my occasion
The staff was unbelievably knowledgeable and made me feel like it was all worth the money
On my second visit , I went and ordered a little less crazy
I found that the service was just as fantastic
Sapa is the best all-around classy, trendy, upscale, with a down-to-earth attitude, not to mention those amazing chocolate chip cookies, my kind of restaurant i have found in a long time!!! oh YEAH and that's the truth
I love this place
Great staff, service, atmosphere, food and drinks
Great for work-entertaining clients and dates and anything else that you want to impress
I was very unimpressed by Sapa
My family is from Viet Nam and I failed to see much vietnamese influence in their menu, it takes more than just rice paper rolls to qualify as vietnamese cooking
We had the hanger steak which had a nice sauce, but was far too fatty and tough
The duck was average
I came to this restaurant expecting alot, but I'd have to a agree with the majority of the Citysearch reviews - Sapa is more about appearance than substance
My associates and I had dinner at Sapa last evening
We found the restaurant through Citysearch and thank you! We had a 8:30 reservation, the place was packed, but our table was ready right on time
It was a beautiful restaurant visually and the food was amazing
I had the Tuna and my partners had the steak, duck and salmon
All excellent
We were so thrilled to have found such a wonderful place for dinner in this area
Congrats to the owners of this relatively new restaurant for such a fine job

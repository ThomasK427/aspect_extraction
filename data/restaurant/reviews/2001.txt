The only downside: some of the popular food like shu mai and haw gow never made it to us =\
I was about to give up on Jing Fong after the last few times I went and they ran out of shrimp Ha Gow, Chang Fen, Pork Buns, and sweet tofu soup
But I figured out the secret to a blissful dim sum experience there: go before 11 am on a Saturday (Chinese seem to reserve Sunday as dim sum day)
The cart ladies don't really speak english but if you can learn a few choice mandarin phrases you'll be fine
The food here really is higher quality than the other dim sum places
And if it's not crowded, the staff is really attentive
if you want to eat dim sum, don't rely on the cart-pushers
get out of your seat and chase them down if you ever want to be fed
the place gets very crowded on the weekends, so be prepared to be told that your favorite dim sum dish is sold out
go early on a weekday to ensure that you get your favorites
I have eaten at a lot of dim-sum restaurants in NYC and this is undoubtedly my favorite place to go
The dim-sum are delicious, well-priced, and most importantly, freshly made and non-greasy
The trick is knowing when to go: Saturday and Sunday brunch are a wash
Go on Monday - Friday for lunch and you won't have to fight with the tourists and the NJ family in the mini-van crowd
Another tip: you need to chase the dim-sum ladies down
Instead of sitting at your table waiting for the ladies to come to you, walk around and find what they have
That's the best way to get your dim sum
I used to be a fan of dim sum here, but no longer
I was picking shrimp shells from several of my dishes
The food was cold and just average
The service had been slow and inattentive the whole time, but after my table received the check, I asked to have food wrapped up, but was blown off and told 'later'
I was so embarrassed to bring my friends here
Never again!
If you feel like being treated like cattle by the extremely rude staff, then wait for a semi-clean and uncomfortable table so you can sample the mostly cold, sometimes passable dim sum
Maybe the restaurant thinks it may claim to offer an authentic Hong Kong experience but Hong Kong should be insulted
I've been quite a few times and it only got worse each time
If you must, go early
Jing Fong is grand with many big tables and a good amount of serving carts to go around
But classic dishes like Har Kao was prepared in improperly oversized triangular shapes and was not very pleasant
Siao-Mai was heavy on the mushrooms and lacked the smooth refined season of pork and shrimp Jing Fong originally served
I won't mark up on the service because I have been a native of Chinatown and it's restaurants for 20 years and no matter which restaurant, service was simply less than good
Jing Fong is a grand and hectic looking place
But if you want good-ole dim sum, try The Golden Palace located on Mott St
right in from Canal
Service is same, ambience is loud and social
90% who visit are Chinese families so you know its the place and classics like har-kao and siao-mai are made just right
A true dimsum experience
Worth the wait for the classic Hong Kong variety
You might share a table but when you sit down, the dimsum carts come rolling down the aisles
From there it's all about pointing at what you want and eating it
Among the most decent portions around
And you can stay as long as you like
Very few restaurants are big enough to capture the dimsum bustle like Jing Fong
It's far less crowded after 3PM
The dinner menu is good but can be cheaper elsewhere
Delicious and broad variety of Dim Sum
You feel like you are in Hong Kong
The place is HUGE - like a football field
A fun place to take visitors to NYC
The bill can quickly add up though
This place was one of the best dim-sum places I have been to yet
Worth trying
Service is anything but friendly
The place is amazing how big it is
Definitely get there by11:30-12ish for dim-sum
Great food served quickly
Went with a bunch of co-workers and ordered a sampling of everything
Calamari and pork dishes were fantastic! Had loads of food for 8 people and only spent around $100 total
Need I say more?
Great chinese restaurant for those who have actually eaten in China, I got flashbacks the first time I came here; it's affordable, food is served hot and quick, and the atmosphere is chaotic
One thing though, I really do not understand why people recommend the cantonese crabs
I got them once and they were terrible for these reasons: Impossible to eat, messiest thing I have ever seen, and the amount of work you put in for the tiniest bits of overcooked crab is not worth it
Imagine crushed up soggy crab shells smothered in thanksgiving gravy with bits of pork, cause thats the dish! Get the salted squid with hot peppers, any chow fun, and some bok choy and you will not be dissappointed
Oh yeah, and be prepared to wait a bit (20 min) on weekend prime time nights
Ok, style may be 0 but substance is definitely a 10 with the quality of cooking right up there with the top Hong Kong chefs, I dare say!  I've been coming here for the last 10 years when I am in the city and just love the steamed flounder, porkchops and watercress
I recommend this highly for anyone who wants to experience an authentic Chinese restaurant where the focus is on extremely good but inexpensive food
I guarantee you'll come back!
As many have said before me, the decor is as plain as any place I've ever been
In fact, decor-less is more appropriate
But, the food was wonderful
I went with a group of 6, and the service was fast, the food was delicious, and the restaurant was clean
But, one dish that many had recommended on different websites turned out to not be what we expected
Two of us ordered the Cantonese Crab, because of all the recommendations we read
It was very difficult to eat
It was quite messy, and getting the crabmeat out of the shells was more trouble than it was worth
I don't recommend it at all
The Chinese brocolli was one of the best vegetables I have ever had, and the porkchops were great, the sweet and sour pork was great as was everything else we had right down to the fried wontons!
hands down the best chinese food in chinatown
DONT BRING A DATE ESP A FIRST
there is no decor/ambiance expect messy, fun, tasty, cheap eating with the boys/girls
Hop Kee has the best Chinese food in Chinatown! Try these dishes, you wont be disappointed: spicy beef chowfun, peking porkchops or salted porkchops, steak and broccoli, scallopes and snowpeas, and the crabs
I have been a fan of this restaurant for the past 15 plus years! It's always great, fast, and cheap
Worth the trip! (We use to go in every Thursday from Nassau County, Long Island!)
Passing by Hop Kee one is struck by it's unassuming nature
Yet you can't help but notice the number of people waiting to go down the steps of this back alley restaurant and with good reason
While it's true Hop Kee isnt much to look at, the food is the absolute best Chinese food you will ever eat in your life
Not sure what to get? The helpful staff is definite Chinese old school and will help you pick something to your palette
No matter what dish you order, you'll be treated to a tasteful delight like no other
If you're looking for 'fine dining experience' with lesser quality food and jacked up prices to boot, try somewhere else
But for authentic Chinese food and home-style service come to Hop Kee
Hop Kee serves the most delicious Chinese food I've ever eaten
You basically eat right after you order, and you should share dishes so everyone can taste
The prices are dirt-cheap for the food you're getting
Hop Kee was the first restaurant my parents took me to as a kid, i was two years old
I've gone about five times a year every year after that, and now that I go to college in the city, I'm there almost every other week
I've brought so many kids downtown to Hop Kee and I'm not exaggerating when I say 9 in 10 want to go back
Awesome, awesome place!
My fave place to go for chinese in the city
They have great food and a great atmosphere, very homey
I'd highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys great chinese food!

This is the best sushi place on the Upper E and one of the best sushi places in the City
In fact, it is one of the few things that makes living on the Upper E bearable
Crab Shumai rocks! Pumpkin pudding is the best desert I've ever had in a sushi restaurant
The chef looks like a sumo wrestler but he's really nice and cool
The sushi/sashimi is on a different level from most places
Slightly pricey if you order by piece, but very reasonable for a chef selection
The place is small, but very charming with good service
This is genius sushi, really
A wonderful simple little restaurant with clean fresh fish at reasonable prices
What a gem
Go, try, fall in love
The Scene Slick martinis and infused sakes provide the buzz and a DJ lends the beats, but the sushi chefs steal the spotlight at this energetic, unpretentious lounge
A long, thin bar offers maximized front-row seating for those who like to watch the chop and roll
Tables up a few stairs in the back make for more secluded dining
The Food Not sold on Hoboken sushi? This place will raise your expectations on standard rolls
The spicy tuna, untainted by gooey mayonnaise, showcases mouth-melting fresh fish encased in a thin roll of sticky rice
The impeccable, dense and crisp futomake roll, tightly packed for easy chopstick pick-up, combines cucumber, avocado, oshinko (pickled Chinese cabbage), yamagobo (wild carrots) and tamago (sweet egg omelet)
The Sushi Sinatra's crabstick, whitefish, tempura flakes and tobiko, topped with extra-spicy sauce and furikake rice seasoning, is like Big Band for your belly
food is fine but not worth the money
nice atmosphere but definitely one of those places you go to once
Can't beat the sushi, regular here but not so regular lately as the rolls seem to be shrinking! How can a special roll for 14/15 dollars come out the size of the a tootsie roll! But seriously the food is consistently great, remember the edemame should be hot not warm and I'll be back!!
Great scene with unbelieveable food! Frequent and always impressed
If you love sushi, don't miss it!!!! Oh, and don't forget the martinis! FABU
Went there on my 10th wedding anniversary and I won't wait another 10 years to go back
Ambiance was warm and inviting, service was excellent, and the food was even better
Got the sushi for two and an entree and we were stuffed
I will definitely go back
and soon
Truly an exeptional experience
Sushi is as fresh as you can find, anywhere
Dj's play lounge music, not teenybop music and the service is friendly
Very nicely managed
A great find in general!!!!!!
I went on Monday, half price mojito
but they failed to specify that it's only regular mojitos not the specialty ones
So we ended up paying for $9
mojitos with no alcohol
The sushi is tasteless and has gotten VERY SMALL, $14
for a mediocre special roll is pretty expensive
The music is loud and for TEENYBOPPERS
I ordered from this Friday, 5 rolls and 2 miso soups and a 15% coupon
The total was $34
I have been to the restaurant before and love it but may never go back again
When the rolls arrived they were TINY
The miso soup at $2
50 a pop was equivalent to two measuring cups
At nearby Robongi which has huge rolls meaning plenty of fish and $1
50 miso soups the soups were three times the size as SL
I called the restaurant to give them feedback and they did not care
They were defensive and was not open to feedback
Guess they don't care to improve
Sushi and atmosphere are hard to beat! Kitchen food is very good, but go for the sushi, it melts in your mouth
DJ's are a great touch and the service is very friendly
Been a loyal customer for years
They are the best!!!!!!
I sampled a lot of these rolls and they are all great, especially the hudson roll
The sushi is pretty good
It's not the highest quality of sushi but for the price it is pretty good
A sushi for 2 and a roll is about $25 a person
Noisy atmosphere but great food
I am a frequent here for many reasons including, BEST SUSHI ANYWHERE, great music (DJ's and live bands) and friendly, overly? courteous staff
How can such a busy restaurant make you feel so at home? The new head sushi chef has loads of talent and you truly will not find more creative sushi anywhere, especially in NJ
Have a first date? Go there!!!
This is one of the best sushi restaurants ANYWHERE
Great atmosphere, service does vary, but overall very good
Sushi is always as fresh as can be! Never compromised as they say
Highly recommend! BTW, great dj's
the service is sub-par, and has been on every trip, the sushi varies - from slightly above average to poor (had a very very fishy maguro, which isn't a culinary stretch), and the music is often too loud to allow any coversation (i like the music, i just like not shouting at my friends seated with me, too)
don't bother making the trip
I've eaten at this place about 15 times and I have always enjoyed every aspect
The fish is as fresh as any I have had, and I've dined all over the world
Their creative roles and presentation just add more enjoyment to the meal
Additionally, where can you eat great sushi and be entertained by a DJ or a live jazz trio in NJ, or NY for that matter? It just doesn't exist
Expect a long wait as they do not take reservations
All of the other reviews sound like sour grapes because a NJ restaurant made it to the top 10 of NY restaurants
Make the trip to Hoboken, you will be pleasantly surprised at the overall delight that is eating at the Sushi Lounge
Terrible service after an hour and a half of wait, we demanded explanations from the waitress
She dismissed us rudely until called manager, who was ruder
The food eventually was OK
Poor hobokenites, no good sushi place to go
Although the service and the atmosphere are a plus, the sushi is horrible
I actually went there several times thinking it would get better but in fact the food got worse
If you are looking for a place with great sushi try Ubu across the street from Sushi Lounge
The atmosphere isn't as nice but the sushi is fantastic
After reading some of these reviews, I thought that visiting might be a wast of time
Fortunately, we tried anyway and we believe it lives up to the top 3 position in Best of in the metro area for quality, atmosphere and value! The rolls were plentiful and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and the sushi was MOUTHWATERING AND EXTREMELY FRESH
By the way, they don't even have ketchup in the entire restaurant as one reviewer suggests
The dj spun a deep house, most of which I never heard on the radio and certainly did not approach the Pop Genre, and the restaurant was filled with BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE! We had the pleasure of meeting the executive sushi chef who explained in detail his ingredients in the 2 special rolls that were featured that evening AND HE PERSONALLY INVITED US BACK
We will certainly accept that invitation
IT IS A COMPLETE DINING EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!
If your into high volume Teenage Bubble Gum Pop music, kids dressed like a bad rap video, and sushi thats not really sushi, then you'll probably think that Sushi Lounge is phat
We ate some bizzare sushi rolls, including one that had tomato sauce in it
The DJ, (there's a live DJ in the restaurant, no, make that Lounge) has the same taste as the DJ's that play at kids Birthday Parties, I'm 48, and even I recognized all the artists he was using from my childrens parties
It's pathetic, but hey, this is Mall-Town
Anyway after hearing Britney Spears belt out I'm a slave and watching as every table of Hoboken hipsters sang along, I got the sudden urge to cry uncontrollably, instead we just left, and in a hurry
They should really lose the Sushi moniker, and just call it a Pop lounge
Truly Awful
Sushi Lounge may be the best sushi in Jersey, but it can't compare to places in NYC on its best day

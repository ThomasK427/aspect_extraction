The above appetizers and an entree will be perfect for two
Enjoy!
I first went to Asia de Cuba in July '01
Absolutely Fabulous are the only words to describe it! Immpecable service, wonderful food and an atmosphere from heaven
I took my boyfriend here for his 26th Birthday and we had a great time
Although we had to wait a half hour after our rez time, we just got drinks and enjoyed the atmosphere
The food was delicious
definitely a fusion-type cooking
A little pricey, but well worth it
Went with a party of four on a Saturday night, were 30 min
late for our res
were still seated right away
Service was excellent
Food was average, the appetizers were better than the main courses
Stay clear of the duck (fatty) and the lobster dinner ($52 and very dry)
Appetizers were very tasty (oxtail spring roll, thai beef salad, tuna)
Awesome decor (reminded me of the Delano), great service, excellent drink choices
Go with a group
Will definitely be back
Loved everything! The food, the service and the decor
Had to wait a while upstairs in the bar but it was worth it! Would go back
Far below expectations
Lobster mash had shell; salmon and noodles lacking in salmon
Service very slow (40 mins for a drink, 30 mins for a bottle of wine)
Impersonal, brash, and a rip-off
$75++ excl
drinks is just too much not to be impressed
The food is absolutely top notch
I've always had great service too
I love the decor
Don't forgo dessert and order the Latin Lover
It's the best chocolate cake in town
This restaurant is by far the best
You feel like your floating with the flowing white curtains covering the hard walls
Speaking from a restaurant owning family, the food can't be beat - ive had everything on the menu
Comes complete with an awesome bar and lounge, very trendy, modern, beautiful non-stuck up people
Some advice: make a reservation and prepare for fairly expensive meal
small price to pay for the best
Just not sure why the waitress was so angry and annoyed
About what? If you are having a bad day, and you are not able to control your emotions especially if you are in that kind of setting, with customers, in a nice restaurant, DON'T be a waitress
Food was excellent, a little on the steep side but it was good
A bit too trendy but what would you expect
An amazing food experience for the taste buds! Nice ambience and bar while waiting for a table
However, the wait and hostees could use improvement
We waited over 30 minutes with a reservation and the hostees was very rude
Overall, still a great place to enjoy
The Scene The wraparound dining room and polished wood bar have been slammed since opening in 1998
Swathed in sea-foam green with aquatic photographs, it's a comfortable spot teeming with neighborhood regulars: gussied-up grand dames, first-date couples and raucous groups of friends
Servers are professional and serious, but can only handle so many tables at a time
The Food There's something for fish fans of every stripe on the lengthy menu
Freshly shucked oysters and clams appeal to purists, while classicists order crisp-crusted, all-meat lump crab cakes and chopped iceburg-feta salads
Zippier palates share sesame-fried lobster spring rolls, shrimp dumplings with citrus soy, and inventive maki, like the smoky and sweet filet mignon-pineapple variety
Entrees range from strongly seasoned nori-wrapped rare tuna with wasabi-soy vegetables to simple wood-grilled halibut with light caper vinaigrette
Desserts are showstoppers, namely the caramelized banana tower with toasted marshmallows in a tall hazelnut shell
Food was surprisingly good
Salad ingredients appeared nice and fresh
Service with plenty of smiles
Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably
The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic
Recommended: appetizer calamari, beautifully deep-fried, but served with 2 awful sauces--ask for an alternative sauce
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna
If you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!
I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday
The place is a little over-priced for brunch but it is a nice restaurant so that was expected Food (i had the omelette with cheddar, mushrooms and herbs), service, coffee, atmosphere were all fantastic
I loved it and will be back soon
I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait
Just don't do it
Three strikes and this restaurant is out
Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it
And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water
I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city
The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better
My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great! There was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice
This restaurant is such a great place
I have been here a few times for dinner, once for brunch and twice for lunch
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way
The sushi is also great! The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced
Surprisingly, Atlantic Grill has one of the best Sunday brunch menus in the city
It's delicous food and the complimentary memosa or bloodie mary can't be beat!
I have eaten at Atlantic Grill many times and always leave satisfied
It is the perfect blend between smart casual and formal creating an atmosphere that is elegant yet not stuffy
The prices are very reasonable
All dishes: appetizers, entrees, and deserts are delicious
Crowds do come on weekends, so be sure to make reservations
*There is a pre-theatre dinner menu for early diners that is of great value
I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for young couples and first daters
Servers are attentive to this factor
They make you feel like you are in with the in crowd
One word of caution, do make reservations, they try to get you in, but reservations are recommended
A former asst mgr
at a 5 star NYC restaurant,my judgement is fair
I've been here several times
Ambiance is nice; music is CD 101
9 - needs a revamp immediately
Crowd is scene-oriented: young, preppy hipsters and 50-60 year-olds
Food is bad and the tab is quite high
Service is adequate: there is an attempt at traditional French table service, found in high-end restaurants
Their attempt is a failure

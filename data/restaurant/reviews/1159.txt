The bartenders are great and certainly know how to make an excellent dirty martini
I'd go back again and again!
I highly recommend the bacon wrapped scallops, they are fantastic! Generous portions and great tasting food
Wait staff was prompt and effecient
We had a great meal in a warm friendly environment
Quiet early in the evening but picked up later, I will definately be back
The Scene A mod-styled bar area at the entrance gives way to a more conventional dining room ornamented with the requisite Hellenic color scheme: white columns and tablecloths mix with deep blue walls and plush chairs
Service is attentive, relaxed and has a knack for making diners feel that they are the most important table in a packed room
The Food The restaurant's name is Greek for "dream," also a fitting description for some of chef Michael Psilakis's inventive combinations, like light-as-air crispy sweetbreads paired with meltingly delicious foie gras dumplings
Other "pinch-me" perfect dishes include veal tongue with a terrific shreddy, slow-cooked texture and deep porcini overtones; octopus in a bracing lemon, vinegar, mint, and anchovy marinade; and clove-tinged tuna with balls of bulgur wheat
For those who crave tradition, the branzino with artichokes, olives and a foamy avgolemono sauce tastes like the Mediterranean on a plate
This restaurant really has there act together, the appetizers are to die for,the service is amazing, I am of Greek descent and this is the only place i will bring my American friends to
Only thing I was happy at Onera was the food
I have to give credit to the chef, he knows his Mediterranean cuisine and knows how to mix and match the ingredients
But I am tired of hearing your table is not ready yet, have a drink first
We didn't complain and they didn't have the need to apologize but to make things worst our table was between the dining room's entrance and the server station
Trying to squeeze one more table in a corner when people bump in to you every few minutes it seems to be like being very greedy
If we would be seated promptly and sitting at a different table maybe our evening would have been better and enjoyed the food even more
Living in the NYC gives so many choices to try other places before coming back here for another try
We recently booked lunch at Onera online and I had to write immediately to say- WHAT A FIND! The food was absolutely delicious, service excellent and the lunch was well worth the $20- I would have paid a lot more
While dining on a delicate lamb carpaccio, and grilled skate wing, the owner explained that due to low lunch-time patronage, they may be discontinuing lunch altogether
What a shame, because this is the best lunch deal in town
The food is very modern Greek, the chef uses traditional Greek flavors and presents them in a very unique way
For $20, you can pick up lunch at a food vendor or have a delectable 3-course lunch at Onera
I will definitely be back
I found Onera on Open Table and we went there for my birthday
The bar is really fun and funky and the dining room is very nicely appointed
The food was excellent and definitely not what you expect when you think of Greek food
We especially liked the Octopus and the green pea ravioli
The service was outstanding! Everyone was super polite and nice
I will definitely go back
The one negative is that it's VERY noisy! On the other hand, obviously people were having a great time
The place is not very big, but there were a bunch of groups and the Meze are fun to share
To simply categorize Onera as Greek or Fish is to miss the essence of the combination
While individually each does stand alone at Onera, the combination of freshness and preparation makes for a wonderful taste experience
The wine list is diverse and shows the experienced hand of its creator
Staff is accomodating and patient which adds to the overall comfort of the dining experience
Finally a place where Greek food is taken seriously
A great alternative to the usual fish on the grill or the run of the mill in Astoria
This is contemporary food respectul of ingredients and cooking techniques
Polished service, great wine list and beatiful room
This place had horrible service and an incompetent staff
Food was OK and the setting was alright as well
I would not recommend this place until they get a new staff that can complement the food
The management tried to make up for the fact that they made me and my girlfriend wait for an hour after I made reservations a week in advance, but they could not recover from their mistake (they gave me a free bottle of beer), big WHOOP!
I have been to Onera several times since its opening
Each time I thouroughly enjoyed the food
I am not an adventurous eater, and I was concerned the first time I went for dinner
I was not only able to find foods that I liked, like the pastis, but I tried the mezze (raw starters) and thought they were delicious
Soon after my first visit, I returned with a large group for dinner
We relaxed in the lounge area and had drinks at the quaint, yet stylish bar
The staff was more than attentive and the wait staff was efficient, informative, and kind
As a former waitress, I have no tolerance for anything but
On my last visit, I took my parents
Again, it was wonderful
Each time I visit, it gets better! Make sure you reserve the private table and try the tasting menu!
Onera with its menu, superior service and elegant setting offered an unmatched and most pleasant experience in fine dining
As NY offers so many promising restaurants and new experiences, I am nonetheless inclined to revisit Onera and forgo those opportunities
This upper-west side eatery has the best greek food I have ever had not to mention the excellent mixed drinks at quaint bar
Dinners must start with the Meze and indulge in the sea scallops as a starter
The sweet breads off the tasting menu is fab
and all the deserts are great! This place is a must!
Stumbled across this new comer to the upper west and enjoyed one of the best meals I've had in a long time
The menu is quite creative and varied
Our waiter suggested that we begin our meal with a selection of Mezze, the chefs interpertation of crudo, which we did and loved
The attention to detail at this stylish little upper west side eatery is to be commended, all fish selections were cooked to perfection and the loin of lamb brought a new demension to Greek cuisine
The service was both knowledgeable and cordial and the price was very reasonable
The wine list is very varied, with most of the selections coming from Greece
Try a Greek wine, you'll be surprised how great they are
All this right in my neighborhood
finally!
Not only is the food amazing, but the staff is great as well! If you are looking for a well-rounded experience, from service to food and staff, this is a place you will want to frequent A+ for me!
First off, compliments to the amazing chef, I believe his name is Micheal
I had dinner at this restaurant a few nights ago because I'm here for fashion week
The food was absolutely amazing, this meze was to die for
I fell in love with staff, everyone was knowledgeable about the courses, and the ambiance was perfect
I recommend that for any reason, if your in the upper westside area that you forget about any other restaurant and stop by Onera
This little upper west side jewel is truly a find
The dinding room although small is cozy and romantic
The service is friendly and attentive without being intrusive
I would recommend starting with a selection of the Meze, they are small pre appatizers that can be ordered in flights of two, three, four or five
Choose them all, they are outstanding
The menu goes on to include some of traditional greek favorites but each has a twist that will suprise and delight you
Don't miss the Moussaka or the John Dory
For dessert, the cheese selections are quite interesting and the baklava was great
All in all we had an outstanding experience at Onera and look for to returning
I have always loved Greece as a vacation place, but I never thought my favorite Greek restaurant would be in NYC
Greek food so refined and modernly reinterpreted, with a cool room, and friendly and yet professional staff
Don't miss the Raw Meze, the much lighter version of Moussaka and the Rose Dessert
Ask for help with the wines, as this is the largest selection I have ever seen outside of Greece
I really felt that I don't have to take a trip to Santorini to be in love again
Finally a Greek restaurant that is both modern and sophisticated at the same time
Great food, elegant sorrounding and attentive service makes this restaurant a welcome addition to the Upper West Side
Whether you try the classic Pastitzio or the reintrepeted Moussaka the result is always engrossing
The wine list is vast, varied and well priced
My first choice if I am eating in my neighboord
As a young Greek-American, I have waited a long time to see the food of my ancestors break through the traditional food boundaries that Americans have associated with our culture
My wait has ended with the opening of Onera
A truly inspired restaurant that brings the flavors, textures and ingrediants of Greek cuisine to the 21st century
This restaurant has solidified its position as the birthplace of progressive Greek cooking

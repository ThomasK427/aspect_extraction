The semolina bread pudding dessert was an incredible melange of textures and flavors - an I am a real dessert afficionado
The warm chocolate cake was also quite good
Staff were great
Only problem was noise level, which took away from an otherwise perfect meal
my first visit to lavagna will also be my last visit
the food was excellent
the bread was crusty and the olive oil for dipping aromatic
the grilled asparagus appetizer had a creamy parmy sauce
the pasta puttanescas sauce was perfect, the pasta a little too al dente
the service at table was personable and mostly competent
they did have to be reminded that a second glass of wine had been ordered
a couple of deal breakers: when i arrived i was informed that they only seat complete parties
okay, except that in that tight little space it was absurd
we were brought our check before we were asked if we wanted anything else
lavagna seems to have delusions of grandeur
unless they bring the quality of their service up to speed with their food they will be just another flash in the pan
Lately my favorite restaurants in NYC are being discovered from City search
So far Lavagna is my preferred Italian place to eat out
Wonderful and inventive food
The chef is quite the looker also I wonder if she's single - ladies to win a man's heart cook well! Although a 3 course meal with a bottle of sparkling water for two cost me a lilttle more than $100
It was a special occasion for an out of town friend
Will go back again! Hopefully, the out of the way location won't mean big crowds
After news are out about this gem
The very inventive food was great and was nice, cozy and out of the way on 5th Street - so great for a date as I went with my girlfriend
The wait staff was a bit cold as they just pointed us to take our coats without offering
They also didn't smile very much and gave us strange looks
Perhaps it was a long day for the staff, but it didn't sit very well with us
Otherwise, it was a very enjoyable experience
Would definitely recommend though don't expect superior service
i myself have been enjoying the LaCasa' experience since '93
it is extremely affordable for all budgets well worth the whatever you may deem amiable for this tasty treat
this little nook is cozy,luscious simply mmm-mmm good!! bravo! 2 all who partake of the LaCasa experience!!!
I have been to La Casalinga several times and the best value are their lunch deals
You can get an entree plus a drink at a cheap price
The prosciutto rolls are a bit too salty but their pastas are pretty good especially the lasagna and penne al vodka
The service can be a bit spotty since they are sometimes busy taking phone orders to attend to the restaurant patrons so make sure you have a lot of time to spare when you go there for dinner
This is a good place to hang out with friends
This is the cutest little (emphasize *little*) Italian restaurant
Fantastic food, friendly service, good wine selection (not overly extensive, though), and cute decor
Basically an above par neighborhood restaurant, but due to the limited number of tables and a little bit too much light emitting from the open kitchen, i don't think i'd travel to come here
This is the best Italian lunch spot in the area
Great price on the lunch specials
simple good italian food dont expect a 5 star restaurant but it is probobly the best in this area , and the best they deliver!
In Short This Mexican joint's three red-roomed locations keep their kitchens cooking from lunch until the witching hours, churning out a homemade menu for Eastsiders on the go and tipsy revelers looking to nosh late-night
Staples are available every which way--tacos hard and soft, wrapped in tortillas stuffed with guacamole, cheese or black beans; burritos of beef, breaded catfish, pork pipian and chipotle chicken; plus a choice of four sauces from mild to just plain "stupid
"
NY is the greatest food city, just not for Mexican
Take it from a SoCal boy: Do not accept ground beef in your tacos; it should be shredded
Also, do not beg for salsa like it is pure gold (as in San Loco), it should be offered in large bowls for you to spoon on your food at will
Uh, also have some basic flavor to your meats
San Diego Carne Asada
I miss you
It's pretty small here, but the weekend crowds will attest to the tastiness of the food
If you can, try to go during off hours, but if you find yourself standing in line on a busy weekend, you can get your tacos to go, and eat across the street in Tompkin's Square Park
They also deliver late into the night, to your house or local bar
San Loco really is nothing more than a Taco Bell with a little class
The soft shell chicken taco is alright, but nobody would go here for serious Mexican food
Used to live in NY and eat at San Loco often
Haven't lived there in over a decade but I always manage to pop in for a Burrito Loco (good for avoiding morning-after hangovers) or a fish taco whenever I am in town
Great food
super fast service
and most importantly
CHEAP!
The only thing San Loco has going for it is that it's open late
The food resembles Taco Bell, only with slightly fresher ingredients
The chipotle chicken guaco locos are heaven-sent
Anything else
good too
Highly recommended, even at the ungodly hours when one is lucky to find a pizza place open
my go-to Mexican joint
great tacos, early or late in the evening, with prompt delivery service, which is a good option because it's not a place to impress a date
it's what it is--good, quick grub that doesn't disappoint
I *wanted* to like it: great brothel-posh decor; tasty (but weak) drinks
and absolutely TERRIBLE service
Rotated between 3 waitresses, 2 of whom seemed irritated by us
Waited 15+ min
for a beer - not a specialty drink that needed preparing, not even a draft beer - a bottled beer
Got it about 5 min
*after* asking waitress about it (was met with curt sarcasm)
Waited another 20 min
for a piece of pie
When we left a 10 or 11% tip, one waitress ran after us, stood in front of the door, and lectured us on leaving a proper tip
When we cited slow, rude service and weak drinks, she only replied that we could've requested the drinks be made stronger
When asked if this would be done for free, she literally rolled her eyes and sneered, No
Never, ever going back
This was a Saturday night, we were greeted, sat and drinks ordered
after that it was all down hill from there
it took about 10mins to get out drinks and another 25mins for sandwiches
we decided to leave once we saw our waitress put on her coat and leave the restuarant
she never once checked on us after serving our drinks, we asked another waitress about our sandwiches, she attempted to check on them but didn't really get an answer
needless to say we paid for our drinks and left
I have tried this place a couple times as I like to give places the benefit of the doubt in the case of one bad server or a bad dish
BOTH times I went here the service and the waitresses were rude and unattentive
The second time she actually argued with me over why I should enjoy my meal which had ingredients I was allergic to that were not on the menu
Then she FOLLOWED my friend out to ask why she had not tipped her on her credit card bill when we left a total of 18% in cash
The platters cost $15-16 dollars and the cheese and fruit platter was literally a sliced up pear and a small piece of Brie and some blue cheese
Anyway, clearly I haven't been impressed
Cocktails are ok if that's all you want
great atmosphere -- red(!) decore; french/asianesque with nice pressed tin ceiling
The chocolate soufle was quite nice and just about the right attention by the staff

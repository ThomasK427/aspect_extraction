The lobster corn fritters were overcooked and chewy, the venison tacos were lacking some kind of saucing or unification (venison chopped so tiny it lost all its flavor or had none)
redeemed however by the BEST guacamole I have ever had as well as some tasty margaritas
service friendly, upstairs bathroom rocks!
The customer is no longer important
There's great restaurants in Chelsea that also work to keep customers happy, so don't worry about skipping Sueno
Having seen chips and salsa at the bar, I asked for some when I sat down for my $100+ dinner for two
NO, I was told, chips and salsa are only at the bar
I said, really?? and was told, yes
It seems petty, but when I'm dropping cash at a restaurant, if I see food 15 feet away and I request the same, I expect to get it
The dismissive waitstaff didn't help either
I couldn't even pay for chips
It's outrageous
If you can easily fill a customer's request
do it
I won't be back
I'll go to places I was valued as a customer, places I've been many times since moving to Chelsea
They deserve my business
The Scene A soda-shop counter, homey rooster motif and dashes of sea-green paint lend this West Village corner restaurant an old-time air
Mom-and-Pop prices stay true to the theme, but atmosphere stays current with a clean layout
White-shirted staffers add warmth and a dose of propriety
The Food With a confident touch, the American kitchen avoids any comfort-food pitfalls
The fish fry of lemon sole, sauteed rather than deep-fried, has a light, crisp crust and delicate fall-apart texture
Balanced preparations also yield tender pulled chicken with a not-too-sweet barbecue sauce, a knockout meat loaf that's moist and robustly seasoned, and a holiday-worthy apple stuffing
From next door's fountain, the flat egg cream and lightweight milk shake are the menu's only letdowns
I ordered one of the daily specials, pot roast
The gravy was very, very flavorful, tasty and a good compliment to the meat
The mashed potatoes were real which is no small thing today
They actually tasted like potatoes
I am a transplanted Texas and this reminds me of some places back home: basic, good food, not too expensive, great and soothing atmosphere
Unlike back home, no juke box blaring country songs which is a very good thing
We really enjoyed our meal at the Chick-Inn
The service was exceptional
The menu is a bit limited but the food is good and the serving size large
It is an excellent place for a group
I'm so confused why other reviewers were so hard on this place
I've been here at least a 1/2 a dozen times and don't even live in the neighborhood
The food is reliable, Burgers especially are perfect (gotta ask for an extra hit of the special sauce, YUM!) The burgers come with a small helping of salad and sliced and very flavorful potatoes, its the perfect balance! Also recommend the Mac and Cheese and Meatloaf
Certainly save room for dessert
! Awesome space for sunday brunch and they have a great juice bar
and full regular bar
Great for friends or even to take the kids
A very well rounded place!
When an establishment opens with a properly made Bloody it gives me high hopes
I wasn't disapointed
Love the new renovation, great bar in cozy barnwood and the seating is comfortable too
Nice to find comfortable seating these days
I found it to be true comfort food at it's best and it doesn't have to be loaded with carbs
Try the chicken breast, organic, marinated in citris topped with salsa resting on a perfectly dressed mesclun salad
Their soups are to die for
Chicken with homemade dumplings!
The place was empty with three waiters working and it still took 15 minutes to bring us menus
Food is diner quality
This shouldn't be open long, especially because of the relatively quiet corner with little foot traffic
I so wanted to love this place
I live in the neighborhood and I would go there all of the time except--the food is really bland and so-so
Nothing special
I liked it better when it was Anglers and Writers
The food was a bit better
Sigh
The concept is right on, the execution is way off! The food is marginal and tends often to be overcooked
Rare hamburgers means rare, not medium well
Eggs sunnyside up should not be hard with little runnyness to the yolks
The wait for the food is too long, especially for this style of food
The desserts are where this place shines - leaving the best for last
How do these places stay in business? The food was inedible
Can have a much better meal at KFC
I can't deny that my family had a lovely time here
The place is designed with vintage-y charm, comforting lighting a definite coziness
The waitress was superb - friendly, low-key, efficient
But the food was at BEST mediocre; the soup was well-stocked but tasteless, the entrees bland uninspiring
Can't pretend that this stuff is irrelevant, but it is a pleasant environment for an inexpensive meal
no small thing in NYC!
The Scene This easy-to-miss spot is modest in every way, from its size--just 24 seats--to the minimalist decor
The bamboo dividing the dining room and sushi bar, glowing circular paper lanterns and highly polished service are the only flourishes
The Food It's ideal for those low-key sushi nights, when budget and time are at a premium
The menu is dominated by creative, large and filling "makimono"--rolls like freshwater eel with shrimp, golden tobiko and radish; scallops with yuzu zest, scallions and chive oil; and spicy tuna and yellowtail with scallions and cucumber
The sushi's not the only high-quality fish in this tank, however
Appetizers, including braised king salmon dripping with a buttery, briny sea-urchin sauce are also swimmingly fresh
The desserts--little ice cream dumplings with a sweet and sticky mochi coating--are an acquired taste, but everything else wins over the palate immediately
Once you have tried few great Japanese restaurants, you will realize that the best are always the small ones with little decoration
Of course, if all the customers are Japanese, there is no brainer
JBK reminds me about Tomoe sushi, my first Japanese restaurant in the USA
IT is a little smaller than I have expected, but service and food are excellent
If you enjoy sushi that literately melt in your month, JBK is for you
If you are looking for celebrites, loud noise, and big crowd, JBK is not for you
What is everyone talking about?! The prices are obscene just like Jewel Bako
The sashimi/sushi was fresh but nothing special
I tried a huge variety of rolls and was not impressed
Though, on the plus side, our waiter/manager was extremely polite
Stay away from this tiny, tiny place unless all other sushi joints in NYC are closed
Have always wanted to try this place, but walking buy the rolls and sushi looked a bit pricey
Leaving town soon, so thought I would suck it up
To our surprize you could order a giant roll as your dinner
Add a few pieces of 'melt in your mouth' sushi and you have a delicious no hassle meal (comparible to Blue Ribbon) for $35
Granted it was Monday night, we felt like we could have sat there for hours and not be rushed out
I can imagine the restaurant getting crowded on the weekends as it consists of only about 10 seats at the bar and 14 seats in the main dining room
A
Hahahhomeless boozed up man did waltz in during our meal - not unexpected in the East Village - but he was quickly and politely hussled out by the wait staff
it's a tiny space, but adorable decor and dinnerware
i thought the host/wait staff was very accomodating and sweet

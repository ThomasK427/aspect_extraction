I had the three egg omelette with fillings of your choice, and for a whopping $13 received a dish with a lot of one ingredient and none of the other, and a side of anemic homefries
Service was adequate, but not overly helpful or friendly
Will not return
I have been going to Dizzys at least once a week for lunch and it has become a ritual I can not live without
I live for the daily sandwich special and an RC cola
The service is always friendly and prompt
Whether you sit at a booth, up at the counter, or out on the sidewalk caf, there isnt a bad seat in the house
I love picking up a picnic on my way up to a Celebrate Brooklyn concert or just stopping in for a cup of joe and Coltrane wrecked hard (scrambled egg with sausage on a bagel) on my way to work
The house bread is nutty and fresh truly special
Brunch lines can be long so get there early though
I can not say enough great things about Dizzys
If you are looking for quality comfort eats in Park Slope this is the place!
Dizzy's is not a regualr spot for me but I just stopped in for breakfast toady
I never get fruit salad from resaurants because I am usually so dissapointed, but today I tried thier power breakfast, and was blown away
They had cut up mango, kiwi, raspberries, blueberries, and peaches (along with the ubiquitous melon)!! They served it with the standard granola and yogurt, but it was really incredibly good
I don't expect you would find this in mid winter, but I 'd probably opt for a more stick to the ribs meal anyway
Anyway I thought I would tell you what I found
Caesar salad and vegetarian chili was really yummy! Attractive waitstaff and hetfy portions! I recommend trying it, but avoid the booth seating on the right when you walk in - no leg room and awkward table height!
The wait staff is usually too busy and inexperienced to be competent
The food is eh--the fries are very good, but nothing else is at all interesting
Not worth what you are paying for it--especially after waiting half an hour
Also, the A/C sucks
I'll second the recommedation for the Purity--which has much faster, better service at half the price and a whole lot more selection
I usually just come and have the hot Reuben
Yummy, and don't even notice the price
We brought a friend and his son, with our 2 young children for Brunch
HUGE MISTAKE!! Even though the kids only had pancakes, and they could NOT for the life of them figure out how to put chicken on a salad; we paid over $100
00 for 6 of us
2 orders were screwed up, so he had to sit waiting while we ate and vice versa
The waitress had an ongoing diatribe with a waiter the whole time she served us-it was ALL BAD!! Im boycotting
Dizzy's is very overrated by unknowing diners
The food is skimpyand overpriced; a former wonderful cook has left a huge vacuum
Service is adequate but the place doesn't have enough room
Try Second Street Cafe on 7th Ave
for better and always consistent food and service
It was basically a diner with rude college grads serving and overpriced food that was slightly more than just decent
Overrated and overpriced
Head for Purity on 7th Ave
for the good stuff at reasonable prices
With all the new restaurants in the Slope opening up, and providing some good dining options, the old standbys better look out
Their average fare was fine when there was no competition
This place has standby carb loaded, average comfort food that doesn't travel well at all on delivery or pickup
The delivery is usually mixed up, and sometimes you don't get what you ordered
A little pricey in my opinion for the quality, soggy fries came with sandwiches, although their coleslaw is really good
I use to always get the turkey club, until recently where I have gotten more bread than turkey
We've decided not to go back
Park Slope, north of 5th Ave
is severly lacking in good food
Mediocre restaurants simply need to serve up breakfast or brunch and the crowds come
Dizzy's bills itself as a finer diner and this is the truth
The question is whether the finer part, a few little muffins and strawberry butter, warrant long lines, crowded seating and expensive eggs
I don''t think so
I just think Park Slope residents are suffering from a lack of options
Hint: take a car ride to Bayridge or Bensonhurst and try a real diner
No strawberry butter
Big menus, big tables, low prices, and a staff of characters with true Brooklyn flavor
I love this place! Go for the mini-breads and strawberry butter that come as soon as you sit down
We were at our table for a long time at brunch and the staff was very attentive even after the food was long gone
Dont know about this location, but the Dizzys on 7th avenue, only 1/2 mile from this one, has horrible service
Best breakfast is a joke
Try ordering their breakfast sandwich
While it may be tasty, 9 times out of 10 it is unavailable during the breakfast hours
Strange!!!!!!!!
Love the Brunch very underated dinner service
Thet tout it as the finer diner but its so much more
At night out comes the linen tablecloths the food is excellent
The only negative is they are so busy at brunch they won't let you take out
the food was somewhat inventive and it was definitely tasty
our waitress was very friendly, too
it was the rest of the employees who sucked
it was close to closing time, and so my friend and I paid our bill after our dinner
one of dizzy's employees had locked the front door as to prevent new customers from coming in
however, that also meant that he had locked in all the customers still inside the restaurant
in any case, as we were leaving, we found the door locked
then every single employee watched our futile attempts to open the door
instead, we got NO HELP whatsoever
I ended up figuring out that there was another, unlocked, exit
heck, we're not asking for a DOORMAN, but come on
We took our bestest pal here for his birthday and Dizzy's made us feel right at home! The Sunday brunch is fantastic and our server gave us everything we needed to enjoy our meal
If you are looking for a nice place in a great neighborhood, look no further
I would highly recommend Dizzy's for all your brunching needs
From the bottomless cup of coffee to the basket o' scones mini-muffins to the delicious entrees, Dizzy's is the place to be
A bit off the beaten track (i
e
, Seventh Avenue) Dizzy's would seem to promise Slopers a slightly less crowded brunch -- but sadly, many devoted fans have already beaten a path to this door and you won't do any better at getting a table here than anywhere else in the nabe
But if you do make it in, friendly, if sometimes a bit harried, service and high-end diner fare await
Yum - I've been ordering from this place for years, even when I lived 20 blocks away! Now they have a sitdown location at 22nd and Fifth and it's working out great
Food's the same, servers are friendly and prices are fair
Very authentic Mexican fare, as opposed to an american-ized version that you find in many places
The California-style burritos here are huge, and quite good and decently priced
There's not really any seating, just takeout
A welcome find in this restaurant-starved part of Sunset Park
The Scene Decorated with paper lanterns and twinkle lights, Two Boots' main room looks like a birthday party on steroids
Kids love the tabletop crayons and coloring books, but the real crowd-pleaser is raw pizza dough--lumps are available at the open kitchen window
The waitstaff is attentive and responsive, especially to kids' eccentricities, making this spot an ideal family destination
The Food This Cajun-Italian menu is lengthier than its Manhattan counterparts--here, adventuresome diners can still design their own pies, but they can also feast on oversized plates of peel-and-eat old bay shrimp and cajun spaghetti with meatballs enlivened with andouille sausage
Standouts include intensely-flavored ribs, excellent lasagna and crispy cornmeal-fried oysters
Most kids love the "pizza face" personalized pie, but there are plenty of other inexpensive options, from chicken nuggets to mac-and-cheese "Louise
"
I tried Two Boots Brooklyn out for brunch last Sunday

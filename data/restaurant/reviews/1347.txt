My friend and I went there for Dinner and the food was good, our waiter was super friendly, and the owners made it there business to come to our table and introduce themselves to us
Over all, this is a genuinely great place to come have a drink, have a great meal, and listen to some great latin tunes
Ohh be sure to try the Latin Lover Martini
just sooo darn tasty
Enjoy!
I'm not sure what restaurant that negative reviewer went to, but I must say that my experience at Bogota was the complete opposite
My friends and I decided to sit out in the garden
we couldn't pass up dining with Celia Cruz and all the other Latin musical greats on the huge mural out there! We started with this amazing corn--it's covered in spicy chipotle mayo and a mild cheese
Best
corn
ever! The quesadillas were also quite good
For my entree, I had poblano peppers stuffed with salmon
yum! And my friends really enjoyed their Fish Tacos and Skirt Steak
Didn't think it could get any better
wrong! The cheesecake taquito with ice cream was wonderful
It was also cool to meet the friendly owners, George and Farid, who actually came to check on us
Who does that anymore?? Overall we had a really nice experience--great space, great food, great people!
Bogota Bistro is a real welcome to Park Slope
The food is awesome as is the service
It has got to be one of the most friendliest restaurants I have been to in a long time
The arepas de choclo are addictive
The monster-sized tamal is delicious and great for sharing
The cocktail list is creative and Bogota has to have the best mojito I have had in a very long time
Park Slope needed a pan-latin place and Bogota is it
No need to travel to Queens for good Colombian food - Bogata has the food and down to earh service to keep you in Brooklyn
Another plus for being in this area, there's the backyard-turned-into-outdoor seating for nice weather days
And the ambience is great no matter which area of the restaurant you're seated in
Main courses come with rice beans plus a side - all the sides looked delicious and there's a variety to choose from - tostones, maduro, mashed potatoes (flavored with cilantro and black pepper), fried yuca, veggies
the list goes on
Try the arepas de chocolo for appetizers; skirt steak was tender and yummy
The food at Bogota is overall mediocre
The arepas weren't grilled enough, so instead of being crisp and crunchy, they were soft and not even that worm, and they didn't have almost any butter, which is completly indispensable
Tostones were too thick, and thus dry and sandy
Yuca was also cut too thick, so it was greasy and stringy
Yellow rice was undercooked
The shrimp ceviche was good except there were 2 shrimp in it
Major dissapointment was the ajiaco
The soup was chunky and almost broth-less and it was so salty it was almost unedible
Ajiaco is traditionally served with condiments in the table, that the person adds to taste: corn, cream, avocado, capers
This all came included already (killing the fun of the plate) and in incorrect proportions
My husband and I gave this restaurant two tries because we were excited about a stylish Indian restaurant in the Curry Hill area
Although the ambience is very good, the food just really isn't
We found every dish we tried to be consistently underspiced and bland
We had a regular meal and the lunch buffet so we tried a good number of their dishes
I believe they are trying to appeal to the stereotypical American palate and must be failing as the restaurant is consistently empty
I believe the excellent reviews were written by the owners of the restaurant
Dont be fooled, like I was
Its not the atmosphere, its the food
I initially checked out Copper Chimney, as it shares the name with a famous ( very good) restaurant in Bombay
It's not the same ownership, but the food is even better than its namesake! The murgh malai kabab is simply amazing, the lobster masala is just perfectly spiced, and jhinga kurkure (shrimp) is done just right
You can't tell it from its Curry Hill neighbors, but this easily ranks amongst the top Indian restaurants in NYC (I consider myself a big foodie)
Their wine list could be fuller, but their unique cocktails and mocktails more than make up for it
Prices are extremely reasonable, and service is very attentive
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE
I've been back a few times in a month with different guests, and no one has left disappointed thus far
They have a prix fixe lunch for $12 (veggie) and $14 (meat)
I had the 65 chicken and tikka masala
My wife had the tandoori samosa
Both were served w/nice presentation on a stainless tray w/flat bread, dipping sauces, and desert! All was delicious
The waiter was very attentive and answered all our questions about the food
Ambiance was funky and cool with spacey far eastern music in the background
Great experience
We'll definitely be back
What a great find! Came across this restaurant on Citysearch and gave it a try
Food was delicious
The crab cakes, naan and chicken tikka were all great
The Madras Rose on the drink menu was awesome! The staff was very attentive and polite
Would definitely go back!
Impeccable service complements outstanding taste at this copy of a Mumbai favorite
Go soon before this restaurant is discovered by the masses and reservations become difficult to obtain
Traditional appetizers are presented in novel ways, entrees are savory and among the best in the city, and the breads are, well, mouth-watering
Probably one of the top 5 Indian restaurants in Manhattan, but with reasonable prices to boot
The food is excellent, the service has been great ever time I've been, the ambiance is wonderful and the live music is outstanding
The tapas are tasty, but try the garlic chicken breast or the skirt steak
YUM!! It is noisy, so it's not really set up for a romantic dinner, but it bustles and is a happenin' place
My friends and I are there most Friday nights
Went to Havana Central on a Saturday before theater
Great atmosphere and not very crowded
The food was fantastic
The service was very good
For drinks, apps and dinner we paid under $60 for 2 people! I will go back and will continue to recommend this place to friends
I also want to try the location in Union Sq
This is a better place to stop in for a drink than it is a place to eat
The ambiance is great, it's right near the central meeting point of Union Square, they have a list of summery drinks to choose from
I'd stop in again after work with my girlfriends for a drink
But then I'd go have dinner somewhere else
Two problems: food and service
The food was not bad, it's simply standard and unexciting
My friend got a r[a]ck of ribs that wasn't bad, I got a vegetarian platter that consisted of a pile of bland veggies and plain rice
When we were ready to leave, the wait staff of the crowded restaurant was simply overrun
It took us 20 minutes to get a check, despite many attempts at meaningful eye contact with the wait staff
Our party ordered different dishes with variable results
The empanada sampler was pretty tasty
The paella was good and the serving was huge so we were able to share this
The pernil and carne guisada were both average
Their drinks were worth it and we enjoyed the sangria
The servers were attentive to our needs
We liked the atmosphere of the branch in times square much more than the one in union square
We had so much food that we had enough for take home
Great atmospher

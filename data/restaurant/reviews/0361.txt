You will notice that I get torched by the same guy as a result of this review
Don't trust me, try JB and decide for yourself
IF you have $ and you want to try something new, go
IF you are a value-bargain-hunter, don't go and bitch about it
THis is a Japanese-cuisine-boutique-ding experience to the extreme
You can't get this sophicated, pretty Japanese meal even in Japan
YEs, its pricey
But if you look @ the beautiful displays, its worth it
Expensive; pretensious and frankly the sushi is not even that good
pieces are of unimpressive size the menu is unimaginative(nigiri only and some very simple rolls)
The wait staff is aloof all this for a hefty price tag
do yourself a favor dont go
The service was great from the time we entered the door
The pleasant, smiling hostess took our coats and we were seated right when we arrived (with no reservations mind you - although it was a Tuesday night)
From re-folding my girlfriend's napkin on the table when she left briefly, to chillng our wine in back and refilling our glasses at the right time - the service was impeccable
The sushi was exotic though perhaps a little overrated, but I would recommend for the service alone
I'm sorry for the people who came and never got the same
I don't know that I can say anything that will change the minds of the folks who hate JB
What I can say is that I eat here regularly
It is one of the finest restaurants I've been to
and I've been to my fair share here and in San Francisco
JB is one of the only restaurants (hip or otherwise) I've been too who have achieved a score from Zagat's of 26 in less than two years
JB rocks and those who appreciate fine dining seem to agree
We like Jewel Bako
Alright, the service ranges from awful to nonexistent and the place tends to attract blowhards and dilettantes
But the fish is wonderful
If you're in a hurry or suffer from high blood pressure, try somewhere else
Apparently a reservation means nothing at this place
We waited for over an hour to be seated and at least another 45 minutes to get our sushi which was subpar
Don't eat here
Jewel B is up there among our fave nyc sushi places (Kuruma, Yasuda, and Nobu) and its the best value of the lot
The quality and variety of the fish are great, the place relaxing and funky, and the owners delightful
The biggest challenge is getting a table
I wonder what the other reviewers are complaining about - if you're after surimi instead of warasa or otoro, go somewhere else
This is the best sushi place in the city - small, friendly, relaxed
The owners are great, the sushi is very fresh - they have daily specials shipped in from japan - and you will always find something interesting
If you want to eat spicy tuna rolls and california rolls by the dozen, dont bother, but if you want something more special, this is the place
Excellent
Only cons - it is small and each order is prepared for you so you may have to wait a little
but it is WELL worth it
Don't understand the bad reviews
I love Jewel Bako and have dined here at least a dozen times
Sure, its not your neighbourhood fish and rice place, but if you want exceptional sushi and a creative and inventive chef, go here
I also have found both Grace and Jack to be terrific hosts
The sushi is wonderfully fresh and absolutely the best quality
There are only three or four sushi places in New York with this calibre fish
The chef also knows how to prepare his flavors - thin, delicate slices perfectly balanced with the other elements
On the downside, the service is a bit officious, and if you do not order alcohol, you will find a marked chilliness come over your server
The servings are smaller than at many restaurants, but not unreasonably so
This place makes *great* sushi and sashimi
Truly creative, delicious, AND at the right portions
When we finished eating here the owner asked us if we would like more sushi and not even have to pay for it,
though was tempting, we declined because our meal was perfect
I think people who rated down this place are used to filling up at the ubiquitous sushi joints that filled up this city to the point that made sushi join the ranks of delivery pizza
Do yourself and your taste buds a favor
try this place (but please don't be shocked by the bill
there's a price for quality food creations)
very nicely done restaurant, attentive service and arguable some of the best sushi in New York definately try the O-toro - the foie gras of fish!
Although we had a reservation, we were seated about 75 minutes late
Practically there is no place to wait , so we were forced to wait outside in the cold
The food and service were great
The reviews for Blue Smoke are awful, but of course I went anyway, and now must agree with them, but Jewel Bako is not as bad as I'd heard
I knew going in that the dishes are tiny and overpriced, and that the Sushi Bar Chef and the Owners don't have a clue
However, I must say the food was not bad at all
I had a fish Entree, I believe it was the Sea bass, which was yummy, and while the sushi was poor at best, the regular cuisine was decent
I also liked the look of the place
It deserves better than a 1 rating
as an avid sushi enthusiast who has spent quite some time in japan, the portions are jewel bako are not small
they are just what the rest of the world is used to
in the words of karl lagerfield, most american women could stand to diet
the owners have always been lovely and attentive to me and to my guests
an amazing side note: ducasse often gets complaints about their small portions which is even more unbelievable
i have never left feeling less than overwhelmingly full
After receing a bill of $220 (excluding tip) for two we left the restaurant starving
The restaurant prides itself in its exotic selection of fish, but on my plate (the $50 chef's selection which consisted of ten teeny pieces) were the familiar favorites, i
e
salmon, tuna, yellowtail, etc
If you have the taste buds to differentiate between Wild Tanzmanian Salmon and Atlantic Salmon, then maybe it's worth it for you
The reviews on this board seem to be either LOVE J-B or HATE it! I fall into the LOVE IT class
with some negatives
On the positive side the SUSHI SERVICE are WONDERFUL - but in an exotic way
The strange and wonderful dishes are almost always GREAT
Owners Grace and Jack are among the most dedicated resturanturs I have ever met
I have been 3 times now, and plan to go back (as $ allow)
On the negative side, the place is small (which makes seating tight), there is often a wait 9even with a reservation), and the miso soup is an earthy heavy broth, when almost everything else is light and delicate
I really love this place, but undertsand its not for everyone
Still I am amazed by the Love/Hate split among reviews
ok, so I read the negative reviews that were previously written and almost decided not to go
In retrospect that would have been a very bad decision
Dinner was expensive for 4 people, but the food, the service and the experience were unparalleled
Yes, the place is small, and maybe you'll have to wait (we didn't)
But the owner and his wife truly treat you as their guests and the sushi is unbelievable
A great place to take out-of-towners
I've read a lot of these reviews and I can only say- I have no idea what went wrong with your night! I was a little skepticle from these postings- but it was a birthday dinner and definitely the right present
The waitstaff was courteous and attentive- they never let us pour our own sake, our glasses were never empty
The specials were incredible and the sushi- so melt in your mouth good
We had a long lingering meal, we never felt neglected or rushed
It was all perfectly timed
It's not as good as Sugiyama, but not as expensive either
Perhaps an early seating here is a good idea- that way the early lingerers will not ruin your reservation by keeping your intended table occupied

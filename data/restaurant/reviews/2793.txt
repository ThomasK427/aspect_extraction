Back room is a little bright
This restaurant has been a milestone on Northern Boulevard for awhile; it's one of the many treasures of Queens
I've only been here once, and I thought the food was excellent!! I ordered the pineapple fried rice, crispy duck, and beef satay, and I thought they were the best thai dishes I've ever had
I would go here more often, but the prices are pretty steep, in my opinion
The service was excellent, and parking wasn't a problem
If you want to try to have a nice Thai dinner with money not being an object, I think this is a great place to do just that
I've had good Thai before and this is not it
The mussaman curry with shrimp was $18 and the green curry with pork was $12
each serving about the size of soup bowls and there was nothing about the taste that made me feel like i was getting my money's worth
Most places give rice with your meal, but at this place a bowl of jasmine rice cost $1 (their other rice options were $2 or more)
When we asked for two bowls, they just gave it in one big bowl which actually came out to 1 1/2 orders
The only time the waitress paid any attention to us was when she took our order and at the end of our meal to ask if we wanted dessert (by then we had already packed up our leftovers and were waiting for change from our bill)
We're not going back!!!
truly amazing
the food is unbelievable
as soon as i had the curry noodle or the big fried fish i was in heaven
the foods so tasty(the soup maybe a little blandbut ill forgive them only because everything else is out of this world
i had a lichi martini that was soo good and im not even a fan of the martini, then the special short rib app with a chili dipping sauce that was literally finger lickin good!I ordered wholefried fish with the head! and it was so crispy and tasy i wanted another fish! the jasmine sticky rice you get in the bamboo cup is so good and fun to eat
i could go onandon
honestly theprice is great for something diff and so much less that italian dining
i suggest the curry noodle that has the seafood and chicken in it
or the fish or anything!
it is truly my fav restaurant in queens
it IS one of the best restaurants in queens and one of the best thai places in NYC
I have had much pad thai in my day, and I am VERY picky, and Erwans is definitely up there with the best
Their drinks are great using fresh fruit juices and the service has always been a pleasure
I would urge the 2 bad reviewers to give it another try otherwise I believe they are truly missing out
I have eaten there many times and it has been nothign but consistantly very good
I have many friends who have been eating there for years and would say the same
Do yourself a favor and give it a try despite the bad reviews because true you have your places that can go either way but I never though I would ever hear of someone saying they did not like erwan!
The food was definitely average
I would recommend Spice University Place
Service was horrible
We got there around 7 with reservations and didn't get seated till 30 minutes later
Some of the other reviewers could not have been to Erawan, because it is truly one of the best Thai restaurants in NYC (at least Zagat's feels that way!)
Having eaten in Thai resturants all over (including Thailand) this rates as one of the best
Fresh pure ingredients, outstanding presentation and terrific service
The restaurant is beautiful, but is usually crowded, since the food is so good
They opened another one a few blocks away (Erawan Seafood and Steak) which is unbelievable! Even have websites (erawanthai
com and erawan-seafoodandsteak
com)
Have never had a bad dinner at either one!
As a native of Whitestone, and a resident of lower Manhattan for 5+ years, Erawan is a standby favorite of mine when I return to visit friends
Overall, the food is very good - notably the softshell crab w/mango sauce special is amazing! The only cuisines that will provide comparable quality in the vicinity are Greek (if you know where to look) and Pizza
While admitably, the seating is a bit cramped, and the menu a tad pricey, the staff does its best to remedy concerns
The owners and chefs are Thai and quite friendly
In fact, this venture has been so successful, a sister restaurant has been created in similar suit
To those who whine about clientele, you're IN Queens so seriously, get over the BT complaints and appreciate this restaurant for what it is; a valiant and inspiring effort to bring authentic Thai fare to the neighborhood
After reading review here, tied it anyway
Well, service was almost non existant
Beef was of the cheapest cuts imaginable
Chicken was way overcooked
Tam Gan (spicy soup) was almost pure liquid
the only vegatable was a couple of mushrooms
Finally, the check
Very expensive! I will try to listen to others reviews from now on
Although this the only Thai near the train station, I will never go there again
When we got there they wouldnt allow us to sit in the empty area in the back and crowded us in the front with bridge and tunnelers and their screaming kids
Waitress kept kicking and bumping into the back of my chair trying to squeeze by with the tray only inches frommy head
Stay away from the skippy peanut butter tasting pad thai
I like the Gold Star Restaurant
It is a nice diner atmosphere, they have booths all around and a couple of middle tables
Not crowded in the evening I think due to a large lunch crowd
Their turkey is delicious and so is there chicken caesar salad
My companion had the gyros and enjoyed it
The chocolate cake is great too
I'm a semi-regular at this bar
The decor is extremely tacky, but you get used to it
the drinks are decently cheap ($3 domestics/pint)
but it's the food that keeps my friends and I coming back
After 10pm, almost everything on their menu is at half-price! Burgers, pizza, wings, etc
Nothing will blow you away, but it's good filling bar food
The sweet potato fries w/ranch sauce are especially tasty
As far as sports go, there are mini LCD TVs for nearly every table in the back; unfortunately, most of them are fuzzy or broken
but a decent atmosphere on big sport nights
The service is hit or miss
Sometimes you'll get an attentive waitress, but often times you'll have to hail one down like a cab
Service is friendly though
So, overall it's a decent place to go with your boys for some cheap food/drinks and sports
The previous review must have been written by one of their competitors or a bitter ex-employee ! This place is cool
TV's everywhere including many personal flat TV's
and the menu has everything from pizza/pasta to burgers/wings/ribs to wraps/sandwiches
the food is fine
I recommend making reservations so you don't have to wait so long
When I stepped in no one was standing there to greet us until a few minutes later a guy in a suit stepped up
I loved the atmosphere and the decorations were great
The only part I didn't like was the service
It took them more than an hr to get the food to us
I had to hail them down in order to get drinks but otherwise its a great place for a bday celebration!
Good Food - Guacamole made tableside, Great Chicken on a skewer, great sangria, excellent margaritas
If you go in a group, get the margaritas by the pitcher
I like to mix the regular with a flavor - it cuts the sweetness of the flavored margarita
One dollar per person is added to the check when the mariachi band plays
The band really adds to the atmosphere
Reservatios help for big groups or on the weekend
I don't know if other pizzeria's do this but V I Pizza has a pie they call Spicy Chicken and basically it's buffalo chicken nuggets and blue cheese!!!! And it is AMAZING!!!!
The best cheese slice in the world
Get it in house (they don't deliver anyway), admire the sports memorabilia decor and watch Bayside streetlife on Bell Blvd
The chicken and garlic slice and sicilian are also very good
This is a great place for fresh gyros and souvlaki

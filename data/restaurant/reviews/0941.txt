Nevertheless, if this is the kind of dinning you really enjoy, you can't go wrong
Per Se is completely in a league of its own on the NY fine-dining scene
The 9-course tasting menu is a culinary journey you'll be telling all your friends about for weeks
I'm getting hungry again just writing about it
The dishes were exquisitely constructed and the service was fantastic
I wasn't crazy about the generic colors used in the decor, but my taste buds were too happy to notice
In the end, almost $700 for dinner for 2 might be steep, but when the right occasion comes along, there's no place I'd rather be
i took my boyfriend here as an anniversary gift
we decided to get the $210 nine course chefs tasting menu because i had to try the signature oysters and pearls
it was the most memorable and amazing dish slightly warmed oysters in a creamy tapioca sauce accompanied by caviar that exploded on my tongue
the other eight courses were less spectacular but still very good duck foie gras, pork digestation, lobster, sea bream, and more! there were four dessert courses including a very good yogurt sorbet
service was the best that ive ever had every request was fulfilled graciously instantaneously
the downside food is food, and the $550 tab (no alcohol) is steep
with nine courses and many different palates, its hard to wow with each dish
overall, im glad i went to say that ive been, but probably would not pay for it again
I went to Per Se for my birthday lunch
As a foodie, I had very lofty expectations, and I was pleased to discover that the food and staff at Per Se delivered
Fellow diners may think that $650 for a meal is a bit steep, but the overall experience justified the bill
The server, Sandia, was very attentive, friendly, and inviting
Each course was timed perfectly and was in perfect proportion, and the tour of the immaculate kitchen at the end of the meal made me green with envy
Fellow diners are complaining about the price
To that I say, don't go
There is a reason why prices are what they are! Everything is superb: the food, the wines, the service, the ambiance, the linens, the Riedel glasses, the silverware, the dishes, the flowers
It all costs a lot
I don't know of other chefs in the city that are executing food at Thomas Keller's level
The only negative comment I would tend to agree with is from  fellow citysearcher AlexMiro, who eloquently points out how a restaurant of this caliber can be housed in what is essentially an upmarket shopping mall defies belief
I admit I had high expectations
Frankly, that money can and should be better spent flying to the real McCoy in Napa Valley, the French Laundry
But since we are in NYC
Decor was elegant
View wasn't that much to rave about unless perhaps if you are there during the day
The bill was expensive but was better than we had expected
The food was decent and well-made but not memorable
My friends that have also tried Per Se on a separate occasion say there's a dish that's not on the menu that you could ask for, it's a whole chicken cooked in a casserole, it's suppose to be amazing
For my own experience with Per Se, I guess I was expecting to be blown away, but I wasn't
amazing
transcendent
food as art
totally worth the price ($210 apiece including tip but not including wine or tax)
Service was friendly and welcoming, and happy to answer questions
The best dishes were food that I thought I knew (steak, sea bass, oysters, duck) that were cooked perfectly and presented with a few simple accompaniments
Totally worth eating ramen for months to save up for it
Despite the CRAZY expensive prices ($210 tasting menu)
The food was heavenly
The service was impecable and SO friendly!!!!!! ***** 5 stars! We were offered a tour of the kitchen after dinner
Despite the fact the none of us could walk very far, since we were so full, the kitchen was unbelievably clean and orderly
If I made $2,000,000 a yr, I would go back all the time! (good sake and wines)
What an experiance
We were left speechless and remain so
You can drop $500 a head easily, and it's still worth it
We won't ever forget it
Per Se is a very tricky restaurant to review
On the one hand the food was truly memorable, we had the nine course tasting menu, and can honestly say that the majority of dishes really hit the mark
In particular, the salmon-creme fraiche cones were delightful, a special mention should also be made regarding the exceptional 'snickers desert'
However, how a restaurant of this calibre can be housed in what is essentially an upmarket shopping mall defies belief
Ones experience is truly dampened by having to trundle up lifts and escalators, further on arrival at the restaurant we found the actual dining room to be slightly sterile and lacking in atmosphere
The service was good, however, maybe a little rushed
These sound like minor gripes
but if like myself you see dining as an overall experience you will understand these concerns
Overall, very good
I don't know
I went to this place and I just got a pretencious attitude from the staff and the food  was not as impressive as I had been told
incredible food
you are not going to understand it until you actually eat there without a preset budget in mind
I ate once getting the minimum $175 tasting menu, which was great
2nd time dining there, I let loose and got everything they could offer including truffles and seared foie gras, which werent on the menu
the 2nd time was AMAZING
the room is a bit stuffy, but we started getting slightly rowdy anyway
no one seemed to mind
best in nyc
food is just as good as French Laundry, but the decor lacks the intimacy at TFL
at roughly $250 (with no wine), sounds weird, but its an excellent value
Per Se was such a wonderful experience in so many ways
I have been lucky enough to dine here twice and both times were amazing
The food is wonderful especially the Fois Gras - never have I had Fois Gras that is so fabulous
The service is perfect - attentive and they move you along so you are not sitting for 2 hours between each course
Once we had wine pairings which was fun and once we chose our own wine - both were wonderful
The food is truly over the top and the experience is worth every penny
A total special occasion place, but lacking a bit in atmopshere - don't particularily like the mall location
All in all, I am so happy to have Thomas Keller finally in New York!
For a place that needs a reservation (if you can get one) months in advance and commands the prices of this level, the food was just wasn't on par
We had a five-course dinner and none of the dishes really impressed except maybe the signature oysters and pearls
There are several restaurants in the city in this or lower price range where one can have a truly memorable dining experience - not here
I'm not sure how the current rating of 9
7 was calculated considering that half of the user reviews are at Average or below
I can't say anything bad about this place, except that it is overpriced
My sister ate here and her tab was $350 per head (party of 8)
My tab was $320 per head (party of 4)
Definitely special occasion dining
The food is solid, but I wasn't transported as had expected
The price fixed is now $175 per person, the corkage fee $75 per bottle
thus, it's better to order the wine at the restaurant
The sommelier was excellent, the foie gras amazing, but the rest of the food was just very good
I was happier at aureole at half the price
but then again, maybe I'm making too big of a deal about the price/value
Don't get me wrong, this place is definitely good, and if money is of no concern
why not, right?
Per Se is overrated
However, I have to admit that the service was fantastic--wait staff was accomodating and alert; maitre d' was attentive; sommelier was helpful
But, I expected more if I am paying $300/person for dinner including wine and bottled water

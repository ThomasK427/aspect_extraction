I have to say the food and the environment is simply WOW
amazing
I urge you to visit with friends, a new date, lover or simply your husband or wife
The place is eclectic, the menu is unbelievable ( the owner is the chef herself) , she is simply enchanting and welcoming
I can't recall her name but it won't be difficult to find out
Just ask for her and she will be more than happy to have a talk with you
Don't forget to try the personalized chocolate fountain located at the very entrance of the restaurant at the bar
I thought I died and went to heaven
First the setting
Incredibly well-thought-out, airy and tasteful
The food was amazing, combinations and foods I had never had before and I love eating out
The drinks were delicious too
This is not just a tea shop
This is a first class and truly unique restaurant
Perfect for dates
Just go and check it out I swear your love it
Great cozy place
Food is yummy and presented in fun ways
Servers are attentive, but not too pushy
Best drinks in town
and cute bartenders!
i had a nice experience there
it just opened and they have numerous different homemade infused vodkas
its a cute tea room that also holds tea ceremonies as their main service
this cool, trendy tribeca rest/bar has more than a great burger
but the burger is fantastic! the chef Alex apparently grinds up the sirloin and make the burgers daily by hand
BIG and Hearty with a full plate of crispy fries!!!
BEST HAMBURGER EVER !!!!!!!!! COMES WITH A FULL PLATE OF FRENCH FRIES AS WELL
THE CHEF MAKES AN UNBELIEVABLE HOME MADE SPICY KETCHUP
I WAS VERY HAPPY TO STUMBLE UPON THIS PLACE
small and hidden this great new spot is a great addition to tribecca
great location on duane near the corner of greenwhich
a warm cozy atmosphere to grab a cold beer at the big mohagony bar or an unexpectedly tasty dinner: freerange cripsy chicken, burger and fries, seared tuna, and CRABCAKES (my favorite)
the smoked devilled eggs rock are a unique touch as well
nicely decorated with cool rock and roll photos and after dinner the nightlife tends to pick up
i'll be back
This place is so unexpected, just a tiny little bar, but it serves dinner and even a really good weekend brunch
Really friendly bartender recommended the smoked devilled eggs, the perfect bar snack
We had a great time and will definitely return
Forget the rest
give good burger a try and you will see why, it really should be ranked the best burger in NYC!
Overall - it's good stuff! The burger is smaller than what we're used to, but probably the size of what a burger should be
The fries were awesome and so was the chocolate shake
Seating is hit or miss depending on what time you go
I got lucky around 12:50 p
m
with a table for two
If you need to satiate that just off the grill burger craving, then Good Burger will take care of it
Unfortunately, the burgers are small and the mediocre bun is what you'd get from a supermarket - not what I'd expect for a $5
25 cheeseburger
However, the fries were perfect - crisp and virtually greaseless
My husband I had our rehearsal dinner here
We had 60 guests in the back terrace
Everyone had a great time and remarked on the wonderful food (calamari, empanadas chicken skewers were the real winners), the very yummy sangria, and the excellent customer service
The restaurant staff really worked with us to throw a great party
Most of our guests were out of towners
We were able to find a place with a NYC feel without the urban pretentiousness or crazy prices
Since our party, we've become regulars
Each time we visit is a great experience
Went last night for the 2nd time
Although we were unlucky in missing the jazz band (which the time before was incredible) the food, wine, server, and owner made it all worth it
It was wonderful
The wine recommendation of Timpenello was lip smacking
The beef carpaccio is the best I have ever had
The breaded chicken with mashed carrots was simple, but refreshing
The empanadas were average
The seafood skewers were lightly seasoned allowing the true flavor through
The server was very attentive and polite
Freindly place you could go on a date, with friends, or alone with a pooch
The upstairs outdoor section we arrived in to finish of one last glass of wine - Yum!!! Go today - or better yet, wait until the next jazz night!
Waiting for friend of mine one night - stopped in for a drink and appetizer
Relaxing warm atsmoshere
Nice place to have a romantic dinner or even to hang out with friends
If you love spinach - a must have is Empanadas Argentinas
In my opinion the attitude on the Slope has been getting a little upitty lately, and Futura is a welcome relief! The atmosphere is casual, laid-back, and the service always comes with a smile
I was just there for the fourth or fifth time last Saturday night, just to have drinks with friends, and we ended up staying to eat, of course
The food has never let me down yet, always fresh, always well-portioned, and delicious
Wine by the glass is a great way to go here -- good selection and reasonably priced
All the good things you want from a neighborhood restuarant, but the over-all experience is more than the sum -- it's a fantastic place to hang out!
Futura is a favorite place for anyone with a fine taste for the good things in life in brooklyn
Beautiful people there are always ready to please and they give this elegant place the perfect setting in which to enjoy a great meal
Whether you are looking to relax, an exciting place to meet a group of friends or an intimate time with a sweethearth, here you can have it all
Many Regulars already found a home here and like Futura, we're here to stay! The appetizer are delish ,a good selection of wine by the glass
the owners are very accomodating, all my experiences at Futura been extremely postive! Great addition for the summer are the terrace and a lounge backyard heaven dubbed CLANDESTINO
Futura is new venue for a good hang in Park Slope
It's conveniently located on 9th Street, between 4th and 5th Ave, very nice environment, friendly service and excellent food
The best thing about it is that it has jazz music happening on Wednesdays and Thursdays on a regular basis! Now you don't have to travel to Manhattan to see a gig, it's all in Park Slope
We loved the recommendation for the wine, and I think the eggplant parmigiana appetizer should become an entree
However, our guest ordered the Risotto with Salmon and Goat Cheese special, and it was extremely bland
The server did not check back with us, and even though she ate only two bites, noone asked if there was something wrong
She filled up on the bread and spread
It wasn't until the next day that she realized that there was no goat cheese in it!
Linguini Clams, Herb Crusted Salmon over lentils cous cous were phenomenal, service was nice and not pushy, i seriously could not have another bite
I had the lentils and cous cous for lunch the next day because my friend and I had appetizers before our entrees-- portions are pretty decent for the price, and tasty to boot
The salmon was a bit overdone, but was tasty enough to compensate
I have enjoyed Futura even when it was called Boccacio, and I knew that last night being my dad's 80th birthday, with my family coming in from all around the city this would be the perfect place
Empanades, seafood skewers, beef carpaccio, assorted cheeses were just a lovely start
The ribeye steaks, lamb shank, chicken milanese, herb encrusted salmon and the parrillada argentinas were simply superb
I have known my family to be very picky in restaurants but all I heard was how fantastic it all was
To prepare all these items and not have one criticism, especially from my family proves why this restaurant offers every guest so much; with jazz night, too

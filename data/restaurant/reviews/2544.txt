Don't let the size of the restaurant fool you; great things definitly come in small packages!
I took my wife to Erminia for her birthday dinner and wasn't expecting something this good
We loved it! Ambience is incredible and very romantic
Dimmed lights, candles
Food is good and reasonably priced
They have a long list of wines which are pricy but worth the buck
There are only 8-10 tables, so you receive a lot of attention from the waiters, which is good
The Albanian guys (could be the owners of the place) were very friendly (one's name is Nicholas, nice guy)
I strongly recommend this restaurants for dates and romantic occasions
Oh, by the way you should definitely make a reservation and don't forget to give yourself enough time to find parking around the restaurant
My boyfriend and I shared our anniversary dinner here
It was amazing, the food was fantastic and reasonably priced for what you get, service was great
The ambience was sexy, although it wasn't quite as dark as some of the other reviews stated
Also, it was a bit louder than the other reviews and people were using cell phones! Please don't ruin a good thing--- leave the cell at home or silence it!!! Preserve this unique find!
IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND OUT ABOUT ERMINIA I CAN ASSURE YOU IT WILL BE YOUR NEW FAVORITE SPOT
I HAVE BEEN HERE THREE TIMES AND IT HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT AMAZING EVERY TIME
THE RESTAURANT IS QUIET AND COZY WITH BREAD BASKETS AND WINE BOTTLES LINING THE WALLS, WITH ONLY A DIM LIGHT ON YOUR TABLE THE SEX APPEAL GETS KICKED UP TO 10!!! THE FOOD FROM THE FRESH MOZZARELLA APPETIZER DOWN TO THE TARTUFO DESSERTS ARE AS AUTHENTIC ITALIAN AS YOU CAN GET IN THE CITY
THE BEST PART OF THE ENTIRE DINNER IS THE WAITSTAFF
THEY ARE UNREAL , SO ATTENTIVE WITHOUT BEING OVERBEARING AND AS POLITE AS YOU CAN ASK FOR
EVERY RESTAURANT IN THE CITY SHOULD MODEL AFTER THIS ONE
I WILL GO BACK FOR YEARS TO COME, AND AS A TESTAMENT THERE ARE NO OTHER BAD REVIEWS
THANK YOU ERMINIA
my now fiance and i went to dinner here the night we got engaged
very romantic, candlelite setting
service is very attentive, but acted as if tthey did us the favor
overalll
would def
recommend it, but save upp for a special occassion
it is bit pricey
This is a warm, intimate, romantic room, with wooden walls and flattering lighting
The best ravioli I've ever had
The staff is efficient but with an edge
Cozy ambiance
Candle and small flower dish on every one of the small, intimate tables
Biggest complaint is the noise
Small space makes it a little more noisy than I would like
Leave your cell phone at home!!! Jerk at the other table brought his and talked loudly all 3 times it rang! There are signs on the wall saying, No Cell Phones
You should have seen the look from the Maitre d'!
I took a chance on this place based on the great user reviews and was most certainly pleased when there in person
It was the best dinner of my recent visit to NY
The ambience was incredible, and the food was great too
If there are 2 of you, ask for a 2 seat table against the wall
Service was great, and they were very polite
I heard some rave reviews about this place
Heres my scoop
Ambiance- absolutely fantatic, great place for date
Small quaint, quiet
Perfect
I had Grilled calamari for appetizer and Lobster Ravioli and they were both fantastic
My Fiancee had the rolled checken for dinner
It was very disappointing
I love food and this dish I found tasted horrible
The desserts were great, and the s service was hit or miss as they forgot my port wine
Maybe It was a bad night, but I would try again
The best dining experience ever! I took my fiance here for dinner right after we got engaged and we weren't disappointed
She's a vegetarian and despite that, they had plenty of tasty options on the menu
The service was professional and friendly and the food was extraordianry
Definately the place to go for a romantic night out
This small and quaint restaurant has now become my favorite one in the city
The service was outstanding as well as the food
The ambience is one that is rare to find with its romantic feel
This is absolutely the best Italian I've had! Not much of Northern Italian fan, but the food really hit the spot
Desert was fantastic, and service was impecable
A candle-lit table in the corner was reasdy upon our arrival
A must visit before it becomes mainstream
Any date would be incredibly impressed!
I took my wife here for a candlelit romantic evening meal and Erminia's didn't disappoint
The setting is probably one of the most intimate, romantic places in the city and by my guess one of the best kept secrets
The restaurant only holds 35-40 people which adds to the romantic atmosphere
The food was some of the best we ever tasted
The fresh ingrediants were obvious, giving the food that extra flare which made for a perfect meal
This place should be FIRST on any couples list who wants fine dining and a romantic evening
My fiance took me here on my birthday and it was the perfect choice
The food was outstanding and the ambiance was so romatic with the entire restaurant candlelit and not crowded
If you want a romantic evening this restaurant is a perfect choice
It was my birthday dinner with a new beau and I had no idea what to expect
I was glowing from the romantic setting and the courteous and unpretentious staff who knew exactly when to approach and when to leave us alone at the table
The food was superb - flavorful and authentic Italian with mouth-watering desserts
Who knew that little dark facade would lead to such an enchanting eatery
now I understand why this is the spot for engagements and anniversaries!
Eliza does not hate this
Here is why: Like so many people I know, I just want to escape a quot;scenequot;, eat exquisite food, and not be agitated by another stranger's presence
At Erminia, the impossible is possible
Erminia is a mystical illusion that begins when the owners turn on the music, and dim the lights
The waiters are really Italian, and the food is too
The home-made pasta is killer
Just loose the cell, check the tude at the door, and sit in the dark with the one you love
This is romance without the glitz
Like old money knows, bigger is never bettER
Erminia makes Elio's look like a Vegas showgirl
The food is absolutely terrible and the service is worse
my girlfriend and I love this place
Great food, great service, great location and ambiance
The one downside is they don't serve naan, but the chipati is a good substitute
We recomend this place as a must at least once every two weeks
Whenever I go here I get two eggs over medium with rye toast and it's always yummy
I guess eggs are eggs
but they cook them right at least which is a lot more than you can say about other diners, and the home fries are nice and crispy
This place always seems to be busy when I pass it, but the two times I have went there the food has been mediocre at best for both my dishes and my friend's (except the fresh-squeezed orange juice), so I am a little perplexed as to why it is somewhat popular
It probably doesn't hurt that it is on a very busy corner

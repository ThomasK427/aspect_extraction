The Food Chef Tom Kearney (Blue Hill, Jean-Georges) presides over the contemporary, pared-down menu
His smoked trout, paired with capers and horseradish vinaigrette over a crisp potato pancake, makes for an exciting opener
Among the entrees, Sweetwater schnitzel layers a juicy breaded pork chop with a fried egg and anchovies for a tart bite
Succulent grilled hangar steak comes with finely battered onion rings
Though the strawberry shortcake has too-salty biscuits, the chocolate terrine brings together firm and melted textures with elan
I went on a weeknight evening when it wasn't very crowded - the service was terrible (10 minutes went by before they even took a drink order, the food took forever to come out), they didn't have two of their wine selections and the waiter brought me a bottle that was barely so-so and was 6$ more than I wanted to spend, the food had a poor flavor and quality to it AND there was a burning smell that kept waifting out of the kitchen
A really bad experience for 100$ tab for two
I highly recommend Sweetwater
The ambience is typically Left bank bistro, where you can find a romantic table, where you can hide or dine with a group of friends
The menu is full of great surprises laced with far away spices
Try the pork loin or the hanger steak; all fabulous
The skate fish melts in your mouth
Dont forget to top it all with the Food of the Gods, this exquisite marriage of chocolate sauce, souffl/cake and ice cream
Overall, it is always a superb dining experience, at affordable price
Enjoy!
I ate there on a Tuesday night, it was fairly quite, and great for couples or a group of friends
The wait staff was attentive and laid back
The food was prepared promptly and was excellent
I suggest the beet and goat cheese salad
That rocked
And the Pork loin was superb
I was very satisfied and plan to go there again
Nice place
my wife and I went in last weekend, and I'd like to know what happened? We were in twice before, and really enjoyed everything, but this time the place was chaotic! The waitress was sweet and did all she could to make us feel comfortable
She looked mortified by the guy at the table next to us that was obviously very drunk and NOT WEARING A SHIRT! We could not believe that the owner only laughed and continued serving him drinks
I can deal with their dog running around the dining room, but shirtless drunks? The food took forever, and was edible at best
Our waitress told us they had a new chef, so I guess the guy from New Orleans is gone, but the frat house vibe, dirty silverware, dogs and drunks turned us off long before the food had a chance to
We will not be going back
I have visited Sweetwater's twice, and both times have been sorely disappointed
My friends have spoken highly of the spot, but I am beginning to question their judgement
Granted, both times I went for brunch, but eggs are pretty hard to screw up
Yet, Sweetwater managed
The first time, I was impressed with the ambience and wine, but waited a good 20 minutes to order, then another HOUR for my food
When it finally came, my meal arrived first, my girlfriend's food a full 20 MINUTES later
Worse, her order, a simple eggs over medium, came out cold and soggy, accompanied by burnt homefries and burnt bacon
Our server could hardly look us in the eye, and was actively dismissive when we asked where our meal could be
Yesterday, I went again, and again was given burnt, dry food -- the flavor was seared right out of the meat
Disgraceful
I work near Sweetwater and have become addicted to the place - basically am eating my way through the menu
I bring clients there all the time
Been working in Williamsburg for a few years now and I'm relieved a restaurant like this has come around -- a very comfortable, low-key atmosphere without being either grungy or too sleek, amazing food, a killer bar, and super nice staff
The neighborhood had definitely been missing a place like this before it came around
I went there for lunch, and we had two soups and ordered the special chicken with potatoes and broccoli rabe, 1 glass of wine each and a cappucino
The food was not bad but there was nothing special
The chicken was a little bit dry
When we got the check it was $84
for LUNCH!!!! I don't mind spending money, but I found ridiculous that I was charged $26 for some chicken and potatoes
I liked the food but keep in mind to ask the prices for the specials
The Scene The facade of dark wood beams hints at monastic simplicity, but this raw fish and sake joint is a bit more jumbled inside
Brick walls, mod white plastic tables and a curtain of strung Japanese figurines ring the perimeter, while a large three-sided bar sits right in the middle
The crowd can be sparse, but the staff is energetic and knowledgeable
The Food Clean, strong flavors prevail in the largely seafood-based tapas, among them a tuna tartare with a light mustard sorbet, and a vibrant ceviche of scallops and salmon over fanned avocado
Layered "bombs," a circular riff on sushi, hold such morsels as rich white tuna with ginger sauce, and a delectable eel topped with minty shiso
Seaweed salad and Japanese pickles, and the occasional special of a succulent barbecued rib, nicely complement the fish
Desserts change weekly and include unusual items like panna cotta with sweet red beans
I have to admit that their food is relatively good even to my native Japanese's taste
But their service is unbearably terrible
We've been there once before, and that time too, the service was a bit slow
Craving for some Japanese food in my neighborhood, we tried Bozu again yesterday
When we got there, there were quite a few tables available
A un-experienced waitress took our drink order
20 minutes later, our drink that has been sitting at the bar for 10 minutes and a glass of water my boyfriend asked for finally came to our table
The waitress took our menu away, without taking our food order! At that point, we've decided to leave as soon as we finish the drink
Non of the 3 waitresses/waiter didn't pay attention to us who'd got no food on the table and had been trying to get the check
Finally, my extremely patient boyfriend and I decided to leave a bill on the table to leave
As we were leaving, nobody still realized that we were taking off
Amazing
As one of the old school tenants I've seen the area of williamsburgh and greenpoint transform itself from a dark and crime infested spot to one of New York City's favorites
Everyday brings something new and worth checking out
One of must places is BOZU! If your night calls for a quiet get together with friends, or the significant other this is the place to visit
Sit down by a candle light, and gaze into each other's eyes
Great service, soul crafted food, and trendy cocktails might even make you fall in love ;) The few, but carefully chosen works of art make BOZU trully one of my favorites
an original
Bozu is a tight design
The food is as slick as the decor and its a really fun place to eat
The prices aren't out of line with trendier williamsburg eats until you see the heavy-handed use of negative space in the presentation of the food
Bottom line, don't go here if you're hungry
The food is extremely tasty but you'll need to get four orders of a dish to get a full meal
Go here because you're on a date and want a bite to eat before going out to a club
Its a fantastic place to flirt with your tragically hip girl
Everything you get here is home-style and good quality
Come here when you're hungry for mom's cooking and can't get home
Try the chicken cutlet, pierogis, noodles,borscht
In Preview New York's favorite restaurant duo are at it again, this time bringing in Lidia Bastianich, Joe's mother, for what they're calling a "classic Italian" restaurant
It will be the largest of the duo's restaurants so far, seating up to 200 in a space across from Chelsea Market
Menus aren't available yet, but one very unusual detail has been leaked: Valet parking will be offered
What a beautiful restaurant! It was great
We sat near the entrance in a little area off to the left of the entrance
Sampled many of the menu's selections and wines
Good place to people watch, if that's your thing and we sat next to Lidia
The service by the staff was excellent, particularly the sommellier/manager
Expect to get a big bill, but there is nothing small about this place
The space is gorgeous
The food was so-so and you would think it was a french resturant, the portions were so tiny
But even then, that would mean there would be rich flavors to take in
Not the case here
Wine was excellent
A little overpriced though
However the wait staff was great
I sort of feel bad for them as they should be working someplace that will last

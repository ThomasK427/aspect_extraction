Even the waitress admitted to me (I'm Asian, so was she), that the menu was adjusted for American taste
The sushi is subpar and the soups were so laden with salt that both my mother and I (we've both been to Tokyo and have relatives there) asked for cups of hot water to dilute the sodium mess
The waitress kept apologizing
That's why you'll never see any true japanese eating at Sharaku
The people giving this place high marks are the ones who dont' know any better
Now where are the Japanese? They're over on St
Marks one block down, eating at the Yakitori place
Located in the Japanese alcove of the East Village, Sharaku is a quiet, pleasant Japanese restaurant
The decor is very nice; windows provide an excellent view towards 3rd Avenue and the surronding neighborhood (Law Order is shot around this area)
The sushi is average when compared to the likes of Yama and Iso
Go for the spicy tuna rolls (the best I have ever had in NYC) and avoid the tamago
The lunch specials are a deal (they changed their lucnh specials a year ago
it was better back then, but still worth it); dinner prices are average
Service is okay; it depends on the waiter/waitress
Overall, Sharaku is one of those resturants that I keep coming back to
The wait on a Sunday afternoon was a bit long, considering only 2 waitresses were on duty
But once seated, the food was delicious, and for the price, the meal was well worth it
The fish tasted fresh, and my, the ginger was delicious! Try their yellowtail, it's superb
There are a lot of affordable Indian restaurants in this area, but Curry Mahal is hands down my favorite of the batch
Every dish is excellent and the staff is uniformly friendly
Curry Mahal is just around the corner from indian Row on 6th st, yet it feels worlds away as the people are humble, the food is delicious and the prices are soooo cheap
It is a small restaurant with wonderful atmosphere and incredible service
The water keeps on coming and that is helpful because if you ask for extra spicy-it is! Personally I prefer the mild dishes like the coconut soupd and the Motor Ponneer is the best I have tasted
My boyfriend likes the chicken curry extra, extra hot and he is crying by the end of the meal
Cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough
Get in before the secret is out and the prices go up!
In Short This Spanish standby is a festive (and in-expensive) spot to feast with friends
While couples mob the diminutive ground-level dining room, groups are dispatched to the long tables in the candlelit den below
The eponymous paellas--five different varieties--are the main draw, with the couple dozen tapas, ceviches, sangria tying for second
The Spanish wine list includes a nice selection of Riojas
I went to La Paella with two girlfriends several weeks ago
The food was absolutely delicious, and our server was very sweet and attentive
We were also really impressed with the sangria, and even more so once our bill arrived and between five dishes, a pitcher of sangria, and dessert, the total came to about $33 a person including tip
The only downside was this rando at the table next to us who kept interrupting our conversation with his inane questions
Definitely going back!
La Paella is a fun place to go to
The setting is great for a date, it's romantic and has a very good sharing menu
A paella dish is enough for tow (or more if you order a lot of tapas to start) and the sangria is pretty good
I've never been downstairs for dinner, but the upstairs is a little cramped
The last time I went, most of the tables were occupied and we ended up sitting at a corner table, which would have been ok except for the fact that we were sitting side by side and the table was on an angle (kind of awkward to eat like that)
Overall, this is a fun place to go
I went on Saturday with a group of friends to La Paella and we were seated downstairs
I need to say since I have been eating at this restaurant several times during the last year, that the food is amazing but the space downstairs is very crampy on Saturday nights
We were seated downstaits and there were too many people
It was so dificult to be able to walk around; the conversation was so dificult and the service did not reach the expected height
It was as if we all the customers were from the same party
And we were not
Maybe it needed a better seating managing or organization
If you really want a quality-dinner night, ask to have dinner upstairs
That way you will enjoy the good Spanish food in a nicer ambience
I've been going to this place for a couple of years now and i never been disapointed
The service is friendly, the tapas are great (the shrimps and bacon, the grilled scallops, the stuff pepper and goat cheese, etc
), the paella is simply delicious, and the sangria is out of this world
Overall i really think this place is a winner for a date or for groups (they have a basement that accomodate pretty large parties)
I've been going there for few months now, and I'm always happy with the food (great tapas and Paella), the service (they make you really feel welcome), the music (loud but doesn't bother conversation), the Atmospher/decor (candle light, dry roses on the ceiling), and the Sangria (got to have it)
Overall, great for group and date, good constitancy on the food, good money value
The waiter was somewhat rude
I asked if a 4 person table was available when there were two of us, (on a slow night), he curtly said no, without any attempt to accomodate us
Again when I asked if we could move to a window seat where it's cooler, he quickly disagreed but we moved anyway
Service aside, the marinera paella was dry, dry, dry
Leaving us asking where's the juice??
The flavor was on the bland side and not bursting with freshness
For a place named La Paella, I would expect much better paella to justify its name
Great romantic atmosphere, good food
A little too busy, with the place feeling a little crowded
Would recommend the ham and cheese croquettes and empanadas
For the price a good place
WELL I HAVE BEEN IN NY FOR A YEAR NOW, AND I TRY NOT TO GO TO THE SAME RESTAURANT TWICE, SO THAT I CAN EXPERIENCE AS MANY RESTAURANTS AS POSSIBLE
I GOTTA SAY HAVE BEEN TO LA PAELLA 5 TIMES NOW
THE AMBIENCE IS SEXY AND FUN, LOVE THE ROSES, THE CANDLES, AND THE GREAT MUSIC, I ALWAYS GET THE TAPAS MIXTAS OR THE PAELLA WHICH ARE CONSISTENTLY DELICIOUS, I TRIED THE SCALLOP TAPAS DELICIOUS
THE CHEESE PLATTER IS OUTSTANDING
I NORMALLY DONT DRINK SANGRIA, I AM A PICKY RED WINE DRINKER, BUT I WENT LAST NIGHT AND ALL MY FRIENDS WERE DRINKING IT SO THEY TOLD ME TO TRY IT, WOW IT WAS DELICIOUS
I LOVED IT
SO I PLAN ON GOING BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN, ITS A LITTLE PRICEY, PORTIONS ARE A LITTLE SMALL, BUT ITS ALL WELL WORTH IT
I went there last week with a date, we had 2 tapas and a paella wich was plenty of food and so good, the sangria great, service very good, the candle light, the dry roses on the ceiling got my date in a real romantic mood!!
we had a real good time during and after the dinner ;)
I really recommand this restaurant
I travel a lot for work and eat out often, and don't believe I ever dined in a tourist trap of this caliber
We ordered a mixed tapas plate for two people for $28
A small plate arrived with what could qualify as an appetizer for one person, but MOST CERTAINLY not for two, and not worth $28
This is not a restaurant that can allow itself such prices
With two glasses of underwhelming house wine and a tip, we paid $50 for this poor-man's meal
We talked to the owner who smirked at us and was entirely dismissive and defensive -- the customer's a chump at La Paella
Don't go there, unless of course you like your intelligence insulted
It was a surprise going there and find such a warm atmosphere and such a good Sangria! Food are very delicious and Paella is quite similar to the one you could eat in Madrid!
Fantastic auth
spanish food here
Sangria is worth it, nice setting, and te dish for 2 is more than plenty
I have no complaints on this place
If you get there later in the evening you'll be waiting at a small bar area for a while
People like to sit an chill and not move too fast
Been there last week end with 3 friends, we had great tapas, huge Paella, and beautifull Sangria!!
waiters were very nice, they dont take reservations during the week end, we waited at the bar with some sangria, Very good experience, loud music but we were able to communicate easily, overall i recommand this place to groups and dates,   Will be back more often!!
Came here with a group of 8, and staff made our experience great
How do I know this? B/c the dinner focused on good friends and good food, not waiting around for service or being bothered by rude staff to leave
Food was AMAZING!! Must try the shrimp wrapped in bacon
so delish!! and the paella
yummy!! Better for couples than groups
the spanish word for bland
pretty much tasteless

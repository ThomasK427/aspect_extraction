I keep going back to this restaurant
Everything is incredible - the food, the service, and especially the chicken
Once you've tasted the chicken, you'll find yourself craving it all the time
If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably eat here several times a week
Unfortunately, I live in Manhatthan, but this restaurant is well worth the subway ride and walk
Finally, awesome Mexican food at reasonable prices
Being from Texas, I'm used to getting authentic Mexican food that isn't overpriced
Well, Los Pollito's definately hit the spot! Everything we ordered was amazing---I can't wait to go back
The only thing that was missing was a margarita
Try anything with chicken
The chickens turning in the window are so juicy and tender they fall right off the bone
The chicken mole is a perfect balance of heat and sweet
The side dishes like yuca and platanos are perfect and everything is soooo cheap
Cheery, homey and brightly-colored, this little corner eatery offers Park Slope's finest--and most economical--Mexican food
Great lunch specials, a friendly staff, and homemade hot sauce keep the joint popping with (well-fed) street shoppers
A great stop after an afternoon of Fifth Avenue shopping
The Setting Alfredo feels stuck somewhere between the worlds of the stodgy business-meal restaurant and the red-and-white checkered tablecloth Italian joint
Visual adornments range from the campily sentimental (black-and-white shots of celebrities posing with bowls of fettuccine) to the tacky (a life-sized sculpture of the wolf that fed Romulus and Remus)
Al Hirshfeld's caricatures feel right at home on the walls: Pavarotti sings, Sophia Loren preens and Romans frolic
The Food The restaurant's proprietors claim to be the heirs to the original recipe for fettuccine Alfredo--try it and you'll believe them
Few of Stefano Riccioletti's dishes are particularly eye-opening, but few of them are particularly damning either
Meat, fish and pasta are offered in equal portion; the simple pastas--especially the black truffle pasta with bacon and gnocchi with duck sausage--work best
I went to Alfredo's a few times with my company
the food is pretty good, especially the fried calamari appetizer (they throw in fried apples and peppers, yummy) I had the pasta sampler last time I went (ravioli, lasagna and fettucine) I wouldnt recommend the veal ravioli, everyone at the table agreed that it was dry and just not any good
the lasagna was delicious but the fettucine alfredo, which i expected to be the best, was just ok
very lemony
but it has a nice decor and friendly staff
would recommend as long as you stay away from the ravioli!
Sit at the bar, order a glass of wine, and grab an appetizer: they'll also bring you olives, parmesan cheese, a huge loaf of delicious bread and 3 dipping sauces
We decided not even to order an entree since we were given so much
Nice big bar; reliable, satisfying place when you're in the area
Recommended by our hotel
It was on our way to a show, had nice decor, the water was good, but food was ok
Not bad, but nothing special
I travel frequently on business to New York ( for the last 3 years ) and eat at this restaurant at least once a week
However on Tuesday , November 2 ,I had a terrible experience as the hostess did not want to sit a lone diner - she showed me the worst tables and offered no help when I asked if I could somewhere else
I ended up leaving which was a shabby way to treat a regular customer
The Alfredo of Rome was a very good choice
The food was excellent
It appeared when the waitor determined we were not from the area, our service level declined
We waited some time for our order to be taken and had to ask for refills
The food was excellent and the choices were very good
I do recommend
There must be an Italian in the kitchen and a talented chef at that! It was like returning to the eternal city itself
delicious and fun
The Hirshfeld murals with Italian theme are playful and the decor is modern and comfortable
I will be back over and over
I must have dined at Alfredo's on an off night, because all of the other user reviews are wonderful
I found the food, though tasty, to be nothing out of the ordinary
The Alfredo, Veal Ravioli con Funghi, and chocolate desserts were decent as was the service
But for what you get, the price point was too high, perhaps in part due to the restaurant's Rockefeller Center location??? On the whole, something about the experience was lacking
This is a great place to go for drinks, apps or dinner
I've taken clients here and met friends here for drinks/dinner
I've always been very happy with the service and the food
and you can't beat the location
Definitely try the Alfredo
it's AMAZING!
The specials are godly, especailly the fish and risotto dishes
Don't pass those up as they are usually stellar
The seafood sausage is ok, but the rest of the appetizers outshine them
Excellent selection of wines and they make a mean martini as well
The chocolate mousse is to die for and the cookies that come with the bill are quite tasty
It's my choice of preference for a business lunch
The pasta pomadoro had WAY TOO MUCH SALT in it
It tasted like the chef spilled the salt shaker
I had to pound several glasses of water even hours afterwards
I wonder if the chef knew how his/her cooking tasted
Probably not
The hostess was kind of cold and lazy
The rest was okay
I was actually very impressed with both the quality of the food and service at Alfredo
I took a business client to lunch, and he enjoyed the restaurant as well
However, I was left with the impression that the attempt to stylize the restaurant detracted from the overall experience
While we were trying to have a conversation, bizarre music was being piped in over the speakers, and the decor was odd, to say the least
Overall, I would definitely go to Alfredo again, I just wouldn't take a business client
I loved the style and decoration in the premises
Service was friendly and prompt
The best Italian food I have ever eaten
I am picky when it comes to Italian cuuisine
The only place better is Alfredos in Epcot
Went for dinner before a show and it was wonderful
Would highly recommend Alfredo's
A slightly casual atmosphere was very relaxing and the service was friendly and engaging
Try the alfredo -- even if as an appetizer
Portions are large and full of flavor
Could have easily stayed longer and lounged over some more wine if not for the show
Try to save room for dessert
!
The Alfredo Sauce is amazing
The staff is one of the best in the city
I went for restaurant week
Service was among the best I have ever had in NYC
The fettucino alfredo was amazing
Desserts were delicious
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great
An excellent choice in midtown
In Short This Midtown Italian eatery, located in the former home of William Randolph Hearst, is decked out with velvet banquets, ornate columns and archways, high ceilings, and candlelit tables
Most of the menu is comprised of traditional dishes, such as shrimp scampi and veal scallopine, but a few of the homemade past specialties get a creative spin--such as ravioli stuffed with sea urchin and scallops, and pasta with cantaloupe and anchovies in a Parmesan sauce
I work around the corner from this restaurant, but had never been there
When it reopened under new management I heard they were going to have an old-fashioned lounge in the front, with live piano music

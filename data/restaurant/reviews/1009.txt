We were 5 people paying 60$/person for a two-course dinner with 3 drinks each but we're all going back, so there
I loved Mara's Homemade! The food was fantastic and the service was even better! It is the kinda place that once you try you will be hooked
well worth making the trip to this east village treasure
Are you kidding me? Has anyone who rated this as Cajun or Creole ever eaten cajun or creole food? The owners of this place are great - very friendly, very homey, but frankly I think it's over priced for the blandish comfort food that you get
I think it would be a good place for families, especially with small kids - but if you're looking for New Orleans cuisine, this isn't it
A tiny restaurant that has Cajun food with a New York accent
The Oyster and Shrimp Po Boys were really excellent as was the gumbo and hushpuppies
The owner is very attentive and the restaurant is a real New York experience!
Taste buds go to heaven when you come here
A true diamond in the rough
Portions are just right, service is first-rate
Absoluting delicious, you will not be dissappointed
Cajun/Creole in NYC is hard to come by, so we had high hopes, but this place doesn't quite make it
It's a shame, because they seem to really want to, but everything is a little timid
Etouffee and jambalaya should have big, bold flavors - Mara's comes out very flat
Also, the portions are a little small for the price
Perhaps other dishes are acceptable, but I wouldn't go for the Cajun (stick with Great Jones Cafe for that)
The service and attention are nice, especially for NYC
Make sure to sit in the room on the left - on the right you are sandwiched between the kitchen and the bathroom!  Maybe to NYC tastebuds this is real Cajun, but my experience living in the South tells me otherwise - so yes, you CAN do better than this
Went tonight after having ordered from here before
My first (and certainly not last) experience here was fantastic
Everything everyone has said is true, wonderful home-cooked food, great people, and a nice setting
Went in expecting dinner, but on a slow Monday ended up sitting and talking for hours
Crawfish was fantastic, chicken fried steak was great, and beignets were perfect
Get here during the summer and you can try quite possibly the best lemonade I've ever had
The menu offers a wide and unexpected range of great tastes from the south with a touch of homade love
Make sure you end your meal with a piece of the Bluegrass pie
It's the best I or any of my friends have ever tasted!
Mara's Homemade is one of my favorite restaurant experiences in my 6 years in New York
The owners are so friendly and welcoming that you feel right at home
The food is exceptional--crawfish boil that makes you lick your fingers, etouffee just like you find in New Orleans, beignets to rival Cafe du Monde
And a great collection of De La Vega art on the walls which would be worth the trip in itself to see
All in all, simply fantastic
There isn't a thing I have tasted (in my two trips so far) at this restaurant that did not taste unbelievably great
I drooled everytime I thought about it between visits
Food, Food, Food, Food is/are the reason(s) to go here
Mara and David rule, but it wouldn't make it worth it if the food wasn't just awesome
Gator Bites, Crab Fingers, Crawfish Boil, BBQ Peppered Shrimp, Catfish special, Crawfish toast, key lime pie, bananas foster
One day I am going to be overweight, but if I do it here it will be worth it
PS - drink many hurricanes
If you don't have any Cajun relatives to invite you over for fabulous dinners, have no fear! Get on over to Mara's Homemade and you'll feel like you're right at home
The food is fantastic, the service warm and attentive, and the ambiance just right
The etouffe and crab fingers are out of this world! The chocolate souffle and key lime pie are celestial
Do not delay!
I used to be a Java n'Jazz customer--Mara's former coffeehouse
I went to the restaurant because I knew her food quality
I was very disspointed with her new restaurant
Overpriced, awful decoration, food was bland--and it's suppose to be Cajun
I'm definitely not coming back
Live Bait and Two Boots offer better jambalaya and po'boys
Save your money, and go to any of these two
This place would put Joseph Sisko's New Orleans Cajun Resturant to shame with it's hospitality and most importantly, Terrific Cajun Food
My Crewman and I where there one day to try the Cajun food and it was Superb
I highly Recommend it to EVERYONE
While the owner and family are undoubtedly nice people, they are not qualified to be running a restaurant
Long wait for a table for two (30 minutes) while two different 4-seaters remained vacant
Toast not toasted, then burned on the retry
Mac cheese comes out c-o-l-d
Scrambled eggs are mangled by cooking too thinly
Hash browns were kind of lumpen glops
List of things forgotten that one would expect at brunch: ice in Diet Coke, butter for toast, refills on water, heat in food
The 3-piece band was fantastic and the place has the potential for a certain quirky charm about it that makes you root for it to be something better
Overall, my least enjoyable brunch in 6 years in New York City
Very decent comfort food, with the owners very willing to give great suggestions
The chocolate souffle was great for two and very yummy
We've never made so many yummy noises in our lives at a restaurant! The Crawfish Boil was unbelievably tender as was the catfish, and the spices were genuine New Orleans
The Gator Bites were incredibly fresh and extremely tender with a great dipping sauce
My Crawfish Etoufee was as heavenly as I remember it from when I visited The Big Easy
Heck
even the side dishes of carrots and yellow squash were exceptional
The Key Lime Pie was freshly made and was tart and citrusy rather than overly sweet
The staff was unbelievably friendly and knowledgeable and the owners came to the table often asking how our meal was
I can't wait to go back there again and bring FRIENDS this time
You've gotta try this place
It's a gem that's nestled among a million Indian restaurants, and we're glad that we ventured to the East Village for our meal
I don't understand why this place has gotten such great reviews
We arrived for dinner and got a lukewarm reception- May I help you? -A rather weak greeting for a place that prides itself on hospitality
The decor is a whole other story, tacky art on the walls, forlorn strands of beads and paper maiche banners that looked like they were purchased from a party-goods store, hung in a lame attempt to channel the Mardi Gras spirit
It was a mish mosh of themes that did not work
Not that I mind eating in a hole-in-the-wall, but the entree prices were far over-reaching for a place of such low caliber
We waited as patiently as we could for our waiter to take our order, but after 15-20 minutes, finally decided we had had enough and left
Don't miss this great little restaurant for Cajun food and more on Indian Row! Excellent food and attentive service, not to mention great prices! Check them out!
I ran across Mara's Homemade online and drooled over the menu
It took about
5 seconds to decide to round up a group of friends to celebrate Monday and I'm thrilled we picked Mara's to go to
From the second I walked in, I was welcomed
The food was simply incredible
The service was top notch
We couldn't believe how amazing everything tasted
The personal service and friendliness of Dave and Mara made it all the better
My friends and I realized that we'd be making many, many return trips here to sample all of the mouth-watering (and reasonably priced) selections on the menu
And we'll bring more friends next time
Possibly even strangers
This is by far one of the best meals I've had in NYC
I suggest you go there right now
On a recent trip to NY, I discovered a small restaurant with friendly service, happy people and great food
I had the stuffed mushroom caps and the homemade meatloaf both of which were excellent
I will be making this a regular stop for dinner when i'm in NY
Let me just say we celebrated a friend's B-day here and it was the best decision ever! We were so comfortable we felt like we were sitting in Mara's Living Room
We ordered from the Mardi Gras menu and it was all mouth watering

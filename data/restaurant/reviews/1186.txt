Atmosphere and ambiance both very nice, service very good
The sushi rolls (which I'm bored with these days) aren't anything extravagant but taste very good
I was primarily interested in the sashimi which I would also rate as very good
Any place that has sashimi I like is on the list for a return visit
especially considering the value
We had a few beers, two rolls, six pieces of sashimi, and shared some fried ice cream
bill was under $60
My friends and I ate at Co Co this past weekend and enjoyed the all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi special
The sushi and the rolls were good, the service staff was friendly, and our orders were filled quickly (note: it was early - 6:30 pm - on a holiday weekend and the restaurant was relatively empty)
The one thing we were disappointed in was the selection of rolls
The menu from which you could choose (on the AYCE) was somewhat limited and offered plain rolls
For example you could order rolls like salmon or tuna or spicy salmon, but they did not offer combinations like shrimp tempura and spicy tuna, or eel and avocado on the AYCE menu
They did have other rolls you could order but you had to pay extra for them
Of the rolls we did share, I would recommend the spicy white tuna roll and the eel roll
Both were delicious
Overall we enjoyed the experience and finished eating in a little over an hour
We stayed and chatted for a while and the service staff was nice about not rushing us out of there after we paid our check
I would not compare Co Co to one of my favorite sushi restaurants (Tomoe -which has outstanding, fresh, top quality sushi), however if you're in the mood for an AYCE experience, Co Co is a good place to try
Enjoy!
I took my fiance to this restaurant for his birthday
I was a little nervous when we got in the area because it almost looks like a hole in the wall
The place was nice, clean and romantic
Our waitress was pleasent and patient as we asked about all the various types of sushi
There were rules regarding the meal drinks but nothing that was out of line
I would definately go there again and recommend this place to all my friends
The wife and I went here on a Sunday night for the all-you-can-eat-sushi
There were only two other groups in the place so we were able to be seated immediately
Yes, there are rules for the all-you-can-eat, but they are reasonable (2hours to eat, no sharing with others not getting the offer, etc)
You can't expect them to just give the sushi away! The food was excellent and the service was good (although we got there right before closing so they were a little slow in taking the orders
Not so much that it cut into the 2 hours, though)
went there a few nights ago on a date
i called earlier that day in order to make reservations
the person who answered didn't speak english too well and told me in his not so broken way that i didn't really need one
when i got there, i was told that i did because of how busy they were
before i could voice my displeasure, their staff gave me and my date one of the better seats in the restaurant at a secluded booth
that's where this restaurant began to take off
if not for the miso soup and appetizers (kinda blah) the sushi was exquisite and everything was fresh
we ordered sushi deluxe plates and for $20, you get a hell of a lot of sushi
all in all, it was a great time and coco will be seeing me again
I never thought I'd be penalized at a restaurant for not eating everything on my plate
Basically if you go with the All you can eat sushi for $23 you are given a list of rules which include: 2 hour limit from the time you order, you can only order a certain amount of food at a time then you must clean your plate and order the next serving, if you don't eat all of your sushi you are charged $1 a piece for anything left over, to top it off you are watched very closely by the waitress to make sure you are not sharing your food with anyone who didn't order the all you can eat
This place wouldn't be so bad if they would just let you enjoy your food and not make you feel like you have to clean your plate or pay for it
Many chose the all you can eat option for $23
OK food, but the rice wasn't always so fresh
I am not a picky customer, however service was extra slow and the waitresses were rude
Had to literally flag waitress down to take our second orders for sushi
The waitress forgot about one of our orders and no apologies given
She even asked, Are you sure you ordered that
You can get average sushi anywhere in the city without rudeness
This place is no longer $19
95 for all you can eat sushi but $23 per person
Nice little place but the offerings on the AYCE menu are limited compared to other AYCE Japanese places
You place your order with a waiter and wait for your sushi to be made
If you don't finish your sushi or leave rice behind, you are charged extra so order only what you know you can eat! Service was a bit slow and not that friendly
My family were handed a printed contract of Rules before ordering timing how much we could order, pricing on any uneaten portions
The Sushi was very good
I didnt appreciate being watched because 2 of us ordered the all you can eat and 2 of us ordered from the regular menu
They watched to make sure that no one took a piece of sushi off an all you can eat person's plate
They could make a sign before entering the restaurant that this would be part of your experience, not when your seated
Please change the way you present Rules this makes for a very unpleasant Introduction
The sushi was good, portions were very nice
Prices  are all you can eat Sushi $23
00 with a 2 hour time limit once you place your order, Not when you receive it
We went here last night for a friend's birthday
The sushi was beyond amazing! The rice was soft and everything just melts in your mouth
Great service and drinks as well
The saki list is a booklet! The service was great, especially since they brought out a bottle of champagne on the house for the birthday girl
You have not had top notch sushi in New York until you go here!
Honestly, for 20$ could you do much better? Most all you can eat sushi places aren't so wonderful and they try to fill you up on a lot of rice and get you out of there as fast as they can
But not here! You order little by little (so you make sure you don't order too much and the food stays fresh) and the service was quite good
The restaurant was comfortable and the sushi was really yummy
I left happy, and not overstuffed
Definitely was satisfied for my 20$
Some friends and I went last night for my birthday and were pleasantly surprised
Most of us had the all-you-can-eat sushi; it was great and so were the other dishes we tried
Very authentic (I lived in Japan for 18 years so I have a point of reference!)
My only quibbles with the place are that the service is (intentionally, I think) slow for AYCE so it's hard to get as much as you'd like and the sake, while good, is overpriced
That's where they make their money
I have tried everything available on the AYCE menu, it has all been quite good (although I am not one to be especially particular with food, sushi in particular
) I have been with friends who have ordered off the main menu -- the portions have been more than ample and prices excellent
A weekend treat describes the experience well
It is not expensive, but eating there every night would become rather expensive (kind of obvious I guess, but exemplifies the nature of the prices
) My one qualm is that you have to wait for the sushi to be brought out after ordering it (the waiter will familiarize you with the AYCE system) -- in all honesty, this does you a much needed service, but if your the ultra fast ingesting type (like myself) you'll be eying the sushi bar constantly
Go hungry and chances are you will not be disappointed
While the sushi is a bit on the small side and not really anything to write home about -- the value, service, and atmosphere make up for big time
One thing people should definitely take advantage of us is the $19
75 all you can eat + $15
00 all you can drink option
It makes for a filling and good bang for your buck on a weekend treat
The service is excellent
They are attentive, friendly, and quick
The restaurant is good size for a small business and is well decorated
Well its always a surprise to find another reasonably priced sushi place in nYC
Coco has excellent quality sushi, very nice waitstaff and great sakes! The only downfall is remembering to order a little at a time because they charge you for leftovers, rice included - beware, order only a few pieces at a time! Nice atmosphere and great for groups!
i just got back from a great dinner at coco sushi
the waitress was very friendly and so helpful, especially with sake recommendations!! we went with the okamase, which, i learned from my friend, is basically the chef's choice recommendations
they don't list this explicitly on the menu except for the sushi/sashimi, but basically you give them a budget and they create a chef's menu - you can specify whether you want that all in sushi, sashimi, cooked or whatever! it was so much fun
the best part was not knowing what was coming next! we are adventurous eaters so it was great fun, especially paired with sake - highly recommended! i would suggest $40-50 a person to get a really good variety, but check with the waitstaff - this place deserves a LOT more patrons than we saw tonight
i really hope more people hear about it and go!!!
The uni is the yardstick by which I measure sushi and it greatly passed the test

My girlfriend is a vegitarian and I am a carnivore, and we are both well catered to at I Coppi
The garden is very romantic as well
Come here for a special occassion or just for a night out
you will not be sorry!
I Coppi is a crowd pleaser
I have brought older friends, younger friends, even my parents and all have enjoyed their meal immensely
The garden is beautiful and even good in the winter (heated and enclosed)
The eggplant dish is to die for with a creamy bechamel sauce
The portions are not huge, but hey, this isn't the Olive garden
Their wine list is exhaustive and the service is friendly and informed
Not totally casual, but not dressy either
A perfect date place as well
Ask for the garden when making reservations
The absolute worst meal I have ever eaten and one of the most expensive!  The place itself along with our server was very charming and the Tuscan wine we ordered was notable
Our waitress was overly emphatic about the prowess of the kitchen the entire evening
The bread and olive oil had zero flavor, my pasta was extremely bland, and the seafood was not fresh or prepared well
What's funny is that none of the four of us complained at all until we were together 6 months later- We all wanted to taste the subtle notes of flavor our server was describing in each dish but they just did not exist
Maybe I was there on an off night, but I won't go back!
I Coppi is one of my favorite places in Manhattan
The food is spectacular (I recommend the pork loin), and the garden room makes for a lovely, romantic setting
This is the restaurant where I take out-of-town guests for a low-key, delicious meal
The pasta portions are ridiculously small for $16-18, even for a little girl! While food is good quality, prices are just too high for middle-of-the-line service and average decor
You can spend $25 per entree at a much fancier place
Last year the portions were more reasonable--is this their idea of cost cutting?
This isn't complicated food
It's simple great tasting Tuscan food, the way it should be
The staff is super friendly, the outdoor garden is great and inside reminds me of my grandmother's home in Italy
Go with a small or large group
either way, GO! Si mangia bene :) Ciao!
Fantastic cured meats, delicate home made pasta, an AMAZING wine list, wild boar, heavenly polenta! All of this is a served in the most beautiful covered garden with the perfume of woodsmoke in the air, wafting from the open oven
You must try this place! So romantic!
I've been here twice - once as a twosome, and once with a group from work
I will be going back again and again and again

The food is wonderful, authentic Tuscan
The menu is limited in scope, but daily specials are interesting, and all the dishes I?ve tried were excellent
The wild boar and the bass with cherry tomatoes are a must
Great Tuscan wine list (but a wee bit over-priced at the lower end) with something for everyone
The staff are warm, friendly, helpful and, like everything about I Coppi, unpretentious
There is no music (thank you, I Coppi !), and the place is warm, homely, and inviting
It?s a restaurant for adults, but it has no attitude
I enjoyed I Coppi more than any other Italian I?ve been to in NYC and, indeed, more than most any restaurant in the city
The best restaurant I can imagine
The service was great and the food was beyond belief
We were introduced to various olive oils by a woman that turned out to be the owner and head chef
She also visits with customers and makes sure everything is perfect
AND IT WAS
My wife had duck and I had a pasta special with oxtail in the sauce
They, the salads, appetizers, deserts, and desert wines are perfection
I cannot recommend a restaurant higher
i Coppi has by far the most beautiful, romantic garden in NY
The food is okay--pastas are much better than anything else on the menu
The garden is the perfect setting for any romantic occaision!  Gorgeous!
This restaurant is delightful and a good value
The garden is a pleasure
The only criticism, and it is a minor one, is that the wine is a bit pricy
Otherwise, it's a gem
I remember going to this restaurant back in the summer of 2000 and loving it
I will be going again next week and I must say it is one of the best (if not the best) italian restaurants in town
Hope it has not changed
Hosted a birthday dinner for my wife and 20 guests
We were all seated promptly, got reat help with wine
Steak au poivre is a great choice
The pastry chef, Kyria (sp), made a fantastic layere chocolate cake for 20 (we requested ahead of time)
A great experience for all of us and I got HUGE brownie points
great pre-fixe
awesome food
nice wait staff
all in all
fantastic deal
=)
I went for the first time tonight and tried the 5-course prix fixe with wine pairing
It was an excellent value (not to mention great food)
A few things to note  1
The prix fixe is whatever the chef feels like making (the server will ask you if you have any dietary restrictions)
2
Everyone at the table must do the prix fixe in order for anyone to do the prix fixe

I was with my boyfriend, and we each got a different dish every course
I'm assuming this is the norm, and I think it's a great idea
We shared most dishes, and any dish that one person didn't care for (e
g
, I love duck but my boyfriend doesn't), we would simply switch
Bottom line: High-end food with EV prices
This place has not only great food but the best desserts I've had in a long time
During a recent visit to NYC from Seattle a friend took me to this place, and I must say it is absolutely AMAZING
Get the 5 course
Just do it
The price is eye popping and the service was impeccable
I can't say enough great things about this place
What a gem
I want to go back again and again
Wow
This restaurant is amazing
Every time we come here it gets better and better
The service is friendly and knowledgeable (great wine list) and the value for money! You have to try the pistachio ice cream, and dine often enough with their frequent diner program and you get a five-course tasting menu for two for free
Will go back again and again
And, we were here on Valentine's Day and the dinner was great, the service very refined, and it was five courses, not two courses as claimed by the unhappy reviewer below
Perhaps this place has improved in recent months, or perhaps we benefited from coming when it was less crowded, but I found this restaurant to be beyond my expectations
To the contrary of previous responses, I found our waiter to be extremely attentive (and he was kind enough to let us have the $25 menu 10 minutes past the time deadline)

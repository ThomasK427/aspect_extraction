Delicious Italian food at very affordable prices
Our group of seven got a salad appetizer and three entrees and then split two desserts, and no one went away hungry! Our waiter was very helpful in explaining how dishes were prepared and suggesting how many of each course to order for the table
The house wine is also quite good
It was also packed on a Wednesday evening so I'd definitely make reservations
This restaurant has everything you need to enjoy a meal with friends and family
I have been to Carmine`s more times than I can count on my two hands
The food is superb and affordable
Seating is comfortable and is not too loud or too close to other tables
Each waiter that I've had has been very inciteful and friendly about which entrees to choose, what wines to drink, etc
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone-couples, families, or large group of friends
Also, during the holidays that restaurant itself looks spectacular
Italian style cafeteria catering to clueless porcine tourists downing hub caps full of tasteless (unless you think garlic is the only taste) overly sauced staples
The lines at the door, belie what's in store, for anyone seeking more, that a pitchfork full of bore
I have been to this restaurant approximately eight times, and each time is better than the last
From the bread to the entrees this restaurant is fabulous
You get family sized platters fit for a king
The price is definetly worth it
Although there can be a lenghty wait for a table
it's well worth it
I have eaten there two times
The food is, at best, medicore
The place is over-priced
Enough said
I ate there with 10 other people and the food was all show
I didn't enjoy one thing about it
Working in the food service business for 5 years this is the worst I have seen in awhile
The only thing big about this restaurant was the plates
My date and I enjoyed Carmine's while on a recent trip to the city
We're both from Houston and have enjoyed just about all the Italian food places Houston has to offer
Carmine's beats them all! We would return to NYC just to eat at Carmine's
We arrived about 9 p
m
on a Thursday night, had two glasses of wine while waiting 30 miutes for a table, then enjoyed the best veal and linguine w/ marinara that we've ever had
I would strongly recommend Carmine's to anyone wanting the true NYC Italian experience!
This place is awesome! Great for big groups
Food is indescribable by words
I was in heaven from from the appetizers to desserts
A definite must-try
I have never seen such large portions in my life but it was delicious
We were 6, ordered for 4 and went home with 4 doggie bags
The Osso Bucco special on thursday was awesome and the saturday Carmine's special sounds like a feast for a real meat eater
I'm getting a bunch of friends and we're going back
Didn't have time to try to the dessert but this is the restaurant to go to after the gym when your metabolism is at full steam
I really don't
Carmines serves tourist quality Italian and people line up
It's very weird
The portions are huge, but lots of slop is not really a good thing
This is a step or so above chain food, and to be avoided
If you come here, make sure you haven't eaten for the day
Portions, well, this is why the country may be so fat, the portions could feed a whole family
But you'll this boisterous, loud , party with great food
Try to come with a group if possible
Carmine's is an excellent place to go with a large group of people
We went in a group of 14
We had reservations and were immediately seated
THe entire bill for all 14 of us was only $300!!! And along with the several appetizers and five or six dinners we ordered, we also went through 5 bottles of wine
How cheap! It came to 25 bucks a person! The food was unbelievable
My mouth waters each time I think of it
Try the garlic bread, the penne, and for dessert, definitely get the Titanic!!!!
a great place for a large group of people
They take reservations for groups of 6 or more (which I highly recommend), and the food is good
Family style eating with each dish serving 3 or 4
Try the veal, and the rot gut wine is always entertaining! Just don't expect a quiet, romantic atmosphere
Carmine's is always a good, crazy time!
Carmine's is by all means top drawer for quality food
None of the weird entree's you receive at other quality places, just plain old fashion great Italian food
The portions are enormous
The price for one would be expensive, but since you share the food the cost for four is very cheap
I love this place! Their food is delicious and cheap when you divide among friends
I was very happy about the service as well
I live near by and always see a crowd waiting to be seated
Their pasta dishes are tasty! They also have yummy bread
Go and enjoy!
The food is ok, but you are being sold on gimmick here
Dont go if you dont plan on eating for 4 (or with 4)
I cant help but reminisce to when this space was the best chinese restaurant on the upper west side
Times change, but it seems like this restaurant is primarily populated by people who drive in with large groups from the burbs
I have had the chicken parm, the tortellini and calimari
Chicken parm was good, but not spectacular, tortellini was greasy and the calimari was average
As I said, it is more about the gimmick of being a family style italian place then real good italian food
The bartender there makes a great drink
Carmine's is the prototypical restaurant for group dining as it has a great ambiance, fantastic food(with family style portions) and overall good service
The Klumps couldn't finish the portions of food if they tried
I have been here several times
No matter what we order it has always been delicious
Carmine's is consistantly excellent
The chicken marsala was the most tender any of us had ever had!
I really was impressed by Carmine's on Broadway
I thought the atmosphere was spactacular for family dining
I really liked the idea of everyone in the family eating from the same serving dish
I also thought the family pictures on the walls were a nice touch
The also had wonderful Chicken Marcella over angel hair pasta
mmmmm!!! Great Traditional dining
Crowded, yes
Loud noisy, yes
Wait staff lacking in attentiveness at times, yes
But if you want to go to a restaurant that serves large, family style portions of above average Italian food then Carmine's is the place to go
While it is nice to go to dinner with a small group of friends my suggestion would be the more the merrier
Get a large group, order a number of dishes, add some beer and/or wine, don't expect miracles, and just enjoy yourself
That's what Carmine's is all about

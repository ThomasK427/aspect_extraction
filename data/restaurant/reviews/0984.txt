I heard alot about this place, but only as a lounge/club kind of thing, but we were very surpised to find out that not only this a lounge/club, but it is also a restaurant w/ resonably priced and delicous food
Our server was just fantastic, she recommended that we order a lot of different dishes, so we did, we tried almost everything on the menu, we were a party of six and the whole group enjoyed everything
we ended up staying the whole night
it got crowded pretty early and we met a lot of people
everybody seems to be really friendly and the vibe was just phenomenal
I made a reservation in advance to eat here just for a small party of 2 people
The hostess told us 15 minutes which turned in 1 1/2 hours
Each time we checked in for a status we got a different answer from a different hostess
Then, our table was accidentally given away after waiting for 1 1/2 hours!! Not only is there no communication between the hostesses but no reason to made a reservation since they do not adhere to them
Don't waste your time-all scene that will fade fast
i've wondered about this restaurant for a while now
after reading all the reviews, i found some reviews hard to believe
we had the best time here
our service was phenomenal, food was absolutely amazing and the vibe
definitely happening
some friends wanted to go to pm after dinner but majority ruled and we ended up staying all night
i highly recommend this restaurant especially if you want night of total fun!!!
May I just say that this restaurant ROCKS! Food + Great Music = LOTS OF FUN
The restuarant has an incredible vibe to it
We had a great dinner, which was reasonably priced
and highly recommend ordering a variety of small dishes
My absolute favorite is the Lobster Melt
Our server for the evening was very knowledgeable about the food and the way it is served
Their specialty drinks, especially the Naughty School Girl is wonderful
I'll be back to this restaurant really soon
We tried this restaurant based on the City Search reviews whcih are usually accurate
The food is very sub par for the price, if you want a place to meet a group out to eat and go out it may work but their is definatley better places
If you are looking for a dining experience or good food or value skip it
This restaurant took us in without reservation on a Friday night
We even got outdoor sitting
Since I was on a blind date, there were a lot to talk about
We sat there talking for 40 minutes before ordering, our cute server did a terrific job
She did not make us feel pressure to hurry things along
Great food
The Duck spring roll was yummy and the Hanger steak was done to perfection
we would definately come back here again
Decided to choose this place since it was so hightly recommended for my sister's bachelorette party
I'm happy I did
The service was very prompt and the food was surprisingly delicious
Great vibe, romantic environment, beautiful people (Robert Plant waitresses) and decently priced dishes
The girls in our party expressed that there were not many men in the restaurant, but we didn't care
I would go there again with another group of girls or for a romantic dinner with my beau
Surprisingly, the pizettas were some of the best food we shared
GREAT FOOD, GREAT AMBIANCE  Need I say more, okay then GREAT SERVICE, GREAT DRINKS, GREAT CROWD  Oh and GREAT FUN!
Usually for me, I can never go back to a place more than once and always have a great time, except when I go back to ONE
I have been here numerous times with different friends and it never disappoints me or my friends
It is always great fun had by all, from the food, AS GOOD AS EVER, to the TASTY cocktails
Also the service seems to get better and better each time, if that's possible
If you haven't been, you should go, and if you have been go again for another great evening spent
Just seems like a place where the frat boys from college go now that they are grown up and have day jobs
If dressing well means an untucked oxford shirt, the men are all well dressed
The women seemed to be out to attract
Also there seemed to be too many of the bridge and tunnel crowd there for One to still be considered a cool, hip, NY night spot
There was a line, but it seemed to be very easy to just walk in
When you're feeling like having great food in a cool atmosphere with friends for a reasonable price - you should head to One Little West 12th right away (but make a reservation first
) When I first arrived I was put off by the velvet rope and the line but once our names were checked on the reservation list we walked into the one of the coolest spaces in manhattan
Whole setup and design of the place is unique and totally works
Everything on the menu was amazing and the great thing about it is that you can share things - you can just hang out and have drinks and share or a full dinner
Didn't feel rushed at all and service was great
Will def be back soon!
this place looks good and it's located in NY's happening meatpacking district
But there's nothing else about this place that's deserving
The food is average, the service subpar
Late at night, the restaurant turns into a club scene
Expect the long lines and obnoxious bouncers who decide whether you are good enough to get in
not so many places in new york city with a great atmosphere
i liked the energy here
i'm one difficult person to please, and after hearing more and more bad things about this restaurant, i thought i'd give it a try (also because my girlfriend was forcing me to go)
the decor was sexy
there were different areas on the main floor
they had a dj
the food was great
the service was above average
they had a broiled fluke dish that was absolutely amazing
i'm definitely coming back for that
all I can say about ONE is that they have great food, service and ambience
I come here all the time sometimes it's just me and my boyfriend but most of the time it's with a group of people
i love their menu
it's a sharing menu so ordering alot of different dishes is really fun
they are very helpful in assisting you with menu as it does get a little confusing
but overall
it's a great vibe and the staff is very accommodating
My friends and I have always enjoyed coming here for yummy drinks
So, we decided to try One for dinner
We ordered appetizers in the lounge while waiting to be seated
We left before being seated for dinner because the Diver scallops and the lime/pepper shrimp were NOT FRESH! Stick with drinks flirting!
I thought we would be too old for this place
I went with 5 girlfriends of mine
The crowd was mixed, the bar scence was cool, with a nice mix of men
This place seems to have it all from a romantic evening (earlier in the evening) to a fun lounge scene
We had great food and then hung out at the bar, we planned on staying for an hour and stayed for five
I only felt old the next day but it was well worth it!
Visting the city w/ a friend, we decided to 'stop in' to One Little for a cocktail
At least 4 hours later, we finally took our leave and the place showed no signs of quieting
We made some friends, enjoyed the scene, and danced -- there's nothing more fun than watching a bunch of scenesters freak out to The Beastie Boys' Girls
Friends were in from out of town, where should I take them? I decided to take them to ONE
What a great choice
We ate, great food by the way, drank all the fun drinks, and had a blast
It truly is an all in ONE place to be!
Definitely worth repeated visits

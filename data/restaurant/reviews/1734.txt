Definetly a place you would want to not let people know and keep for yourself
Food tasted very fresh and delightful
Service could be a little better, but no complaints
This is a reasonable, very good Italian restaurant with a much more attractive dining room than the undistinguished facade would suggest
An excellent meal choice in an area that is not notable for charm or meal bargains
This is the place you tell your friends, I know this great, little place
Highly recommend!  Food is extremely good and reasonably priced
The cozy restaurant is immaculate
Definitely get the feeling you are in a family owned/run business
You are pretty much left alone to linger over your food/wine, but not ignored
There isn't a shred of authenticity in the place, except the staff hardly speaks English
Growing up in the Southwest, I assumed that there would be a few authentic restaurants scattered throughout
This place is NOT one of them
Going to the grocery store and buying a box of do-it-yourself tacos would be a better option to eating here, The restaurant is a dive and service matches the ambience
Dining in was a mistake because it was hotter inside than it was outside
The staff isn't friendly and expects a tip for not doing a thing
I would only recommend if you have a case of the munchies and and are desperate
If not, avoid it like the plague!
Havana pies specializes in empanadas
most are $2 each
Everything from cubano sandwich-style empanadas, to turkey chilli, to curried veggies
awesome! the service is good, and they have a few non-empanada dishes that are authentic cuban, along with sides like fried plantains
they have a few tables to sit at, or you can take to go
It is a great resutrat because: -No wait -Great food -It is inexpensive -Great Service -Great atmosphere -Overall, just a great place to be
WELL to start we had reservations for 7:30 pm, we got there at 7:39 and the manager pretty much told us that we were extremely late and that's why they didn't have our table, even though it was Valentine's Day the manager's attitude was horrible
At our table we didn't get any bread until 30 minutes into the seating, which may I emphasize the waiter took really long to come to our table, about 20 minutes
We orderes and our food took about 1 hour to get it, after the long wait
the food was horrible, I could have got better tasting chicken in a local chinese take out spot
I would have to say it was the worst experience at a restaurant in my life, and I work at one so I know good service!
Waited 30 minutes for 7:30 reservations
When we approached the host, he gave a look of we are really busy, patrons are not leaving
Table next to us was a chatty couple who already ate
We had to flag down a waiter just to place our order and had to ask for bread
Halfway through dinner, the chatting couples finally got their check
The service was just horrible, they made patrons wait as other chatted away The host spoke no more than 10 words to us the whole time we were waiting
The lovely coat check lady was the only one who made us feel wanted
From the looks of things, if you are a regular there you would definitely be greeted with a smile but for the passing diner, just keep on walking
I will never go back to Ole
This is the BEST spanish food in town
I come here often the food is great and they have live entertainment
Great job Sue
see you soon  Miguelito
The atomosphere is wonderfully romantic
The colors are warm and inviting
The food is by far the best in the area
Sue the place is FABULOUS!!!!!
Had the shrimp and oyster appetizer - both were small portions and bland
The paella was runny and the service was ok
We will not go back
WE WENT THERE FOR A BRIDAL SHOWER
WE HAD AN AWESOME TIME
THE FOOD WAS VERY GOOD AND THE SANGRIA WAS EVEN BETTER (NOT TO MENTION THE MANAGER
YUMMY!!!!)
THERE WAS SINGING AND A LITTLE DANCING (OBVIOUSLY WE WANTED TO HAVE FUN)
CAN'T WAIT TO GO THERE AGAIN
The cafe here isn't too different from the other cafes that are found in many closeby corners, with similar food options at similar prices
The place is reasonably clean with decent service, but the variety seems to be less than most diners and more expensive
The tables are small and bunched together as this place is not very big
Only recommended if you're in a hurry
The classic Mens only club back in the day is a brilliant hot spot for locals and visitors
This historical place is newly renovated, still sticking to the Art Deco as the entire Waldorf=Astoria hotel is
The Tuna Tartar, Char Grilled Shrimp for Apps were amazing
Both my friend and I had the Surf Turf
I asked for my steak to be switched with a NY Strip insted of strip, for a few dollars more
For dessert, we had the desert sampler and a chocolate Soufle
Even though we could not eat another bite, slowly but surely, we ate it all
You must try out this place, a bit expensice but worth every penny!
The Bull The Bear is the classic old New York place you would expect
Good, albeit tired service, storied location, good food
Came for restaurant week, enjoyed a great small filet mignon, tried the salmon, the crab cake appetizers, etc
All good stuff
Lots of midtown execs for lunch, and I hear that the happy-hour scene should be the first stop on the looking for a rich ex-husband tour of midtown
You've gotta try this place at least once!
The service we had would be best described as clumsy, disinterested and cold
It was spotty throughout
Some steaks came out lukewarm
The sommelier was able to recommend Cabernet because it's good with steak
Waitress was visibly unhappy
Food was good, as a $35 steak should be
Sides like the sauteed Portobello mushrooms were lovely
We enjoyed some nice wine
But overall the lackluster service and unprofessional vibe was a total distraction
We have no reason to return
There are simply many better places out there
Buffet lunch has very limited selection and the quantity of food display is minimal
Environment is rather noisy, a lot of senior tourists sit around and talk a lot
A bit of fast food restaurant environment for Waldorf price feel
The Scene Occupying a cavernous space in the Met Life Tower, the restaurant's soaring staircase, deeply stained woods and lush, curvilinear details make a striking impression
The second-floor dining room, itself gently bi-level, has a serious but relaxed air; smart, impeccably professional and engaging service creates a very comfortable dining experience
The Food This isn't Indian cuisine, but seasonings and techniques from the area lavishly spice up what would otherwise be competent and creative American food
Take roast chicken, to which a cumin jus and anise notes lend uncommon panache; or surreally succulent lamb enlivened by acutely tuned fruity curry flavor
A whole apple filled with roasted egetables and scented with Roquefort makes a striking starter, as does a handsomely composed crab and avocado salad with tamarind chutney in a papadum shell
The menu holds no letdowns: Desserts, like a cone of stiff kulfi with licorice, ot cinnamon souffle, extend dinner's spice into the sweet realm
The place is big and beautiful
The service is courteous and thorough
I went with several friends on a Saturday night and we were seated promptly and well
We ate the prix-fixe and shared
The sweet corn samosa was alright
a bit too dry
The tuna cru was absolutely delicious

Noodle dishes are good (mmm, beef chow mein) as is shrimp with walnuts
That said, it simply is not worth waiting in a huge line
It is often packed, and making eye contact with a waiter can be difficult
Saturday night, the doorway was packed, and unless you'd asked, there was no way you'd know there was a list
Girl behind me asks, Why are we waiting in line again? Aren't there like 400 restaurants in Chinatown? Response: this is the top-rated restaurant in the city
When I heard this, I had to ask myself, why am I waiting in line in Chinatown? That's just crazy
So go early
If you can get seated quickly, awesome
Otherwise, know that there are a number of equally good (or better) places nearby where you won't feel as rushed
They just might not have the ever-important Zagat recognition
The price and good noodles makes this oen of my regular stops in Chinatown
Ironically I usually don't order noodles here
The only complaint is I find the noodles (lo mein) to have too much taste
The noodles are greased, salted, and sweetened too much
The stir fried rice is top notch through
Let me just say that this place is not where you go for a romantic dinner
It's cramped (you might have to share tables with strangers), loud, packed all the time, and usually theres always a line out the door
HOWEVER, it is ALL worth it
because they have the BEST FOOD IN CHINA TOWN!! After coming here, I will NEVER go to any other chinese restaurant in NYC
Try their Beef with Black Pepper Sauce or Chicken with baby bokchoy and you can't forget the pan fried noodle
They are all so delicious!! I live in NJ and I drive an hour just to get their food
When ever you are in town this is the place for good eats
We continue to order appitizers so we can taste everything
Love the Duck and Dumplings
I can't stay away from this place
The food is absolutely divine
The noodle/dumpling soups are amazing
Any seafood is guranteed to be fresh, perfectly cooked, and delicious
The roast meats are heavenly, especially the roast baby pig
There are plenty of options for vegetarians as well
You can't go wrong! Go early or late, it's always packed
It's a pretty old restaurant
I've been going there for 20 years now
It's fast, no frills, no nonsense cheap eats
It's not to say that the quality is cheap, it's just a place you don't bring to impress someone on decor, etc
It's a place to go, when you don't need the fancy trimmings, and the need is to make your stomach happy
Since the place is so small, they like to keep the traffic flowing
The staff is surprisingly responsive
The best entrees are the ones hanging
The food is excellent
If you want good, cheap eats at any time of the day or night, all you have to do is go to NY Noodle Town
Order a bowl of shrimp dumpling soup, a plate of delicious roast pork or duck and beef chow mein (pan fried noodles)
This place looks like an oversized version of your local Chinese takeout joint (you might even have to share a table)but the food is authentic Hong Kong style and CHEAP
Absolutely horrendous and rushed service - even for Chinatown
Hostess was scowling at and insulting customers
Got the check tossed on table 10 minutes after being served and hostess came by to rush us some more
Food was only passable
Others have also complained of same bad experience with staff and service
This place is only for tourists and outsiders who don't know better
Never again!
Well, the food is extremely cheap
The food is dependable - actually, the noodle-soup dishes are dependable
As with many other cheap Chinese restaurants, service is
what you pay for
The atmosphere is bustling and exciting with a lot of activity
The Scene Lunch at this Chinatown institution can be a sunny spot in an otherwise dreary day of jury duty
Decorative touches like Thai masks and travel posters offset the cafeteria feel of the wood-paneled dining room
Low prices and quick service bolster the mass appeal
The Food On this lengthy Thai menu, you can't go wrong with standbys like chicken satay, which comes five to a plate with a mildly spicy peanut dipping sauce on the side
Pad Thai tends to be sweet and has fewer peanuts than usual, but there are no complaints about the generous portion
Curries are another menu highlight, with several choices including Pa Nang with coconut milk, lemongrass leaves, onions and peppers, and Gang Paa with hot and spicy chili sauce
Black sticky rice with coconut milk is a dessert must
I've been going to this restaurant for years
I love Thai food so you can't blame me for exploring other Thai restaurants in the city
However, I can't seem to find one restaurant that beat the authentic taste of Thai recipes Pongsri serves
I truly recommend the TOM yUm GounG soup
If you love hot and very spicy soup
you GOTTA ORDER the soup!! Plus, my favorite dish is Pad Kee Mao
The dish will bring you to your true senses
I'm eaten at Pongsri for a number of years
Its one of the first Thai Restaurants I tried
Over the years, they have gotten better in terms of service and food quality
Would I recommend this place
yes! Their service is near the top in my book
Their staff is quick, friendly and professional
If anyone has my respect
its this place
This place is great for cheap eats
The pad thai is a little on the sweet side but if you like sweet, then this is perfect for you!
me too
i don't understand why people rate this as highly recommend? well, did it use to be good? i don't know, but I'm Thai and have been eating from many restaurant
I'd say that the food is below average
I won't go back
There are plenty of better Thai food out there
Really don't understand why this joint is rated so highly
The food is pretty average
They tend to overcook the chicken too until its dry and nasty
I've been to other thai restaurants around the city and they are all better
If you want examples , go to pam real thai or wondee siam or even rungsit
I was lucky enough to find Pongsri on my first visit to NYC, and I have made a point to return on every visit
Being a true lover of Thai food, I usually cannot wat to return!! The restaurant is small and narrow, as are many in NYC, but it is just cozy enough to create a very romantic atmosphere
And the food is absolutely wonderful! My favorite dish is the Pad Thai
Now I know that sounds boring when taking into consideration the multitude of selections on the menu
However, having visited a great number of Thai restaurants in my life time, I can assure you that only Pongsri has the perfect balance of flavors in their creamy, yet deliciously spicy, peanut sauce
Pongsri has earned a place in my heart
Please, go and enjoy!!
The curry is good here and they have a good vegitarian menu which is a plus
Skewers of beef and chicken was tasty
the only problem with this place is the slow service
I give it a five for the Thai ice coffee alone

We ordered a sushi plate for four for $240
00, which we thought was a great price
BUT, when we saw how many pieces of sushi, we were stunned
The salmon mouse, bland and so tiny
The kobe beef was sliced so thin, we couldn't even pick it up with chopsticks
We had the asparagus, which came right out of the package and placed standing up in crushed ice
The general manager knew we had people from Travel Leisure magazine, insisted on adjusting the check; What he did was add complimentary deserts to it, then discounted them
It was odd
The service was very bad, and everyone seemed really confused
The drinks were great, but we couldn't help thinking that the restaurant may have gone over budget when planning, and is now sticking the cost to the consumer
I had the pleasure of dining here last night
What to say to describe the experience upon entry? Fantastic? Wondrous? Amazing? The place is so gargantuan and yet every area has been given such attention to detail
The food, the uniforms
gosh I felt like a neophyte by my own excitement
A visual treat as well as a culinary adventure
The beef appetizers melted in my mouth and banished any worries that I wouldnt like the rest of the menu
My friends and I are adventurous eaters so everything was eventually shared
Cant say any of us had a bone to pick
Not one
I definately found the trip downtown worthwhile
First let me say that if you love Sushi
you must come at all costs
Why can't all sushi taste like this? Apparently they fly in their fish directly from Japan on a daily basis
There were 8 of us and we were seated right when we got there even though we were 10 minutes late
The place was very sexy and stylish, we all sat on white leather chairs/thrones
The best Saki I've ever had
Sparkling!!!! I agree that the menu was overwhelming and expensive but It was the best Japanese food I've ever had
Get The Top Noten
Def
Different and better than Nobu/Blue Ribbon/Yasuda/Yama/Bond Street/Samba IMHO
Despite some of the other reviews, the food and service were fine (especially for a place so new)
We were promptly seated and well attended to
The space is very well done
However, the menu is way too complicated (bordering on the absurd)
We had no idea what we were ordering is it an appetizer, main course, tapas or something else? The price of our meal was preposterous - nearly $600 for four people!!
Came here last night- was immediately awed by the immensive beautiful space
However, we arrived early for 9:30 reservations and werent sat until 10:45
The maitre'd was unaccomodating rude considering the situation- the whole time we waited, we werent updated once on our table- rather my date fought the crowd to inquire several times
when we werefinally taken down to our table, it wasnt even ready- the couple dining before us had just gotten up from the table before our eyes
Our hostess was apologetic and friendly but the situation itself was unacceptable
Once we sat, we were bought back into fascination with the scenery
Waiter had a great sense of humor recommended : toro steak kobe beef - both marvelous
Overall, food was unbelievable- likewise on decor managers - but the bad reception we received at the beginning was enough to sour any night
1
We had to wait 45 minutes past our reservation to be seated
Drinks took around 10 minutes to get each round
2
Menu is very confusing and overpriced
Insulting to have to pay 40 dollars for 8 miniscule, over cooked rubbery scallops
3
Food quality is mediocre
Management thinks it can obscure poor quality through lighting effects and cooking stones
Fishy oysters, greasy diner like calamari, gristle-like lamb that was more fat than meat
4
Waitstaff is clueless
Too many monkeys in the dining room--and most of them stand around looking confused
So many more reasons, not enough space to write This place is the biggest waste of time and $$
If you want trendy ambience and great food go to Biltmore Room I usually forgive execution errors during inaugural season
However, this place had so many gaping holes that I must warn, buyer beware!
From the moment two doormen let me in and three women took my coat I could hear the low hum of overhead--I knew I was in for an overpriced meal
True to form, we ordered the special sushi-for-two complete with special nigiri sauceprice: $120
$60 per person isnt heavy-handed by Nobu and Masa standards but what appeared at our table was sub-optimal
13 pieces included the tuna roll with tempura flakes in it
There were three types of mackerel and one egg sushi
It was the kind of platter you get jammed with at the local sushi bar when you order sushi regular for $18
In short, bad sushi and big attitude makes this place an affront to the New York dining scene
Heres a tip: Instead of a map of Japan in the verbose menu, try putting a map of Manhattan so diners can choose their location for dessert
II went there with some friends last night and I would suggest everyone check this place out at least once
It's an incredible space
The food in general was ok, though a lot of it was very overpriced
My feeling is that over time it will get better
Our service was very good considering the place has only been open a week
The hostess was extremely nice and accommodating, especially considering that the place was packed and the majority of my party came very late
The people next to us didn't enjoy their service, as I had to listen to one smug women yelling at the manager for several minutes about how bad her service was
In all fairness to the restaurant she seemed like the kind of angry person who will be bragging for weeks to come about how she got some free drinks
My wife I were totally bowled over by the food, ambiance, service, and presentation, a week after opening
Still working out some kinks - beef tataki took a while to arrive, though it was delicious when it did - but overall Megu holds great promise
Sit at the sushi bar to to witness the high-intensity insanity of the cooks there
Sushi sashimi was some of the best we've had in NYC, the sake list is admirable (selected by longtime sake connoisseur/author John Gautner) service was impeccable
The owner even came out to greet us, and gave me a handwritten introduction to his restaurant in Tokyo, when I mentioned that I was visiting Japan the following week
Only negative is the intense incense smell on entry, which reminds one of a funeral
Not appropriate for a restaurant at all, though most westerners probably wouldn't make the same association
my boyfriend and i went after it had been open for 4 days and it needs to make serious adjustments
the ambience is amazing and the service was attentive if not nervous
of course i haven't mentioned the fact that we walked in on time for our reservation only to wait in the empty bar for over half an hour, being seated when we reminded the hostess that we were still waiting
the major problem i had was that the food was so outrageously overpriced we were tempted to walk out on the bill
you can easily find food of equal or better quality at dozens of less expensive restaurants
i just don't think it's neccessary to charge $45 for the smallest portion of salmon i have ever seen
try it out if you have the $$ for the atmosphere but in my opinion it is completely NOT WORTH IT
The scene was magnificent
However, my birthday dinner was ruined by the untrained and unprofessional waiter
Since the menu is not organized in the way to describe the size of each dish, and there is no omakase nor a course, waiter's recommendation may be crucial to decide what to order, but he just recommended what he likes without considering appropriate amount for one person, and even served shellfish to whom who had mentioned she is allergic to shellfish! Some dishes were good though I don't recommend any type of tartar unless you like fishy tartar
It may be too harsh to give poor evaluation to the restaurant which has been only a couple of days since its grand open
Managers were nice, but the attitude of the owner to whom we presented some recommendations to improve their service implies very thin expectation in the future improvement
we also had the privilege of dining here during a soft opening, and while there are still areas they can improve upon, overall it was a truly amazing experience
the decor is beautifully done and when you enter the main dining area, you know you have *truly* arrived
the hostess and owner were incredibly gracious and accomodating; the waitstaff was very attentive, but unfortunately, they still seemed a bit unsure in their presentation
the food is good, but i'm sure it will only get better
definitely start with the oysters -- they were the highlight of my evening!
While MEGU is just opening to the public, I had the priviledge of attending a soft opening dinner -- absolutely incredible! The food itself is like nothing NY has tasted - the most authentic, freshest and delectable combination of flavors aromas

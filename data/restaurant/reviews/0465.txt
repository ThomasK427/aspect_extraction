i will recommend to make a reservation
I actually met Gari through a friend of mine
Old family friend of ours that actually sells all the high end fish to most of the sushi restarurants in the city (nobu, hatsuhana, etc
)
When asked what was the best in the city, he said, gari's hands down
it is because, as he related, that gari's policy on the fish is that the price does not matter, as long as it is the best there is
so whenever you eat there, you're having the best fish in the city definitly
went there, had gary's choice, and it's ruined me for the rest of the sushi in the city
trust me, you'll never think of the sushi the same again
Tuna with Tofu Sauce
Salmon topped with Fried Tomato Slice and a touch of Cream Cheese
Red Snapper with ginger jelly
Chopped Fatty Tuna and Yellow Pickled Daikon tartare
Batter-fried Oyster
Yellowtail with special sauce
the list of Uniquely Gourmet Nigiri Sushi combinations goes on
All served with Freshly Ground wasabi
Reserve a table at the Sushi Bar, and order the Chef's Choice (omakase)
Specify the number of pieces and a price range
Your attentive and friendly server will take care of the rest
The sake list is impressive; ask about the special sakes which may not be on the menu
Gari-san travels frequently to Japan and brings back an ever-changing tasty selection!
My friend recommended their sushi is like 'buttah' so another stop for my group's tour of the best spots in the city
Very fine sushi freshest quality, kampachi whenever I can get
But svc was not up to par
We too had to wait for water/tea refills
My friend came same time Leo DeCaprio's posse also had to wait
Another wallet buster
Sushi of Gari epitomizes the idea that sushi is a form of [food] art
The chefs choice the thing to get, are pieces of sushi (usually 8-10 pieces) and a roll that the chef creates for you, depending on how much specify you want to spend ($50 minimum/person and up)
Although the chefs choice is pricey, its more of an experience than just a good sushi meal because each piece is carefully created as a tasting experience
Its definitely recommended to make a reservation on the weekends, since its difficult to walk-in and get a table
Although the wait staff is not personable, the service is more efficient-like
If you dont want to spend $50/more for the chefs choice, I would recommend getting a bunch of rolls (i
e
yellowtail scallion, spicy shrimp tempura, fried oyster roll) because they have the best rolls in NY
We had the sushi platter by Gari's Choice
It was really good
We were lucky because chef Gari was there when we visited, and himself prepared the platter for us
However we heard that he is not there all the time
He's got other sushi restaurants to take care in Japan
Are you being treated like dirt by waitstaff while they still expect a fat 20% tip? Just because my wife and I did not feel like drinking, our waitress developed an instant bias
We sat with empty water glasses for about 20min after we ordered $80 worth of food
The drinkers beside us had fresh glasses of water brought on trays to replace the empties and a smiling waitress to cater to their every whim
She even came just to tell them that their eggplant was on its way
Still our glasses sat empty
With the water pitcher in sight, I decided to take things into my own hands
Finally her pet patrons left and she started to pay attention to us
Too little, too late
It's time for the mistreated patrons to take a stand
Pay what's earned, not what the norm dictates
The food was absolutely exquisite
The sushi is always fresh and tasty
We go at least 2-3 times/month
My favorite is their spicy tuna roll
For a really special treat, sit at the sushi bar and get the Omikaze - unbelievable!!
that's what i thought after eating at sushi of gari
we heard so many good things about this place but we literally left the place after 40 minutes
the food was just average and i didn't think the fish was particularly fresh
the menu reminded me of those takeaway japanese menus on third avenue, totally lacking creativity
we were seated cramped in the corner CENTIMETERS away from the people next to us
service was HORRIBLE
my sister asked for iced tea twice and the waitress said they didn't have
10 minutes later, another waitress brought iced tea to the other table
(????)  ambience stank as well
and it's completely overpriced
we were still hungry afterwards and the bill was astronomical!!! i would never go back EVER
Order the sushi of Gari selection and let them melt in your mouth
Hmmm is all you will hear from this crouded simply decorated place
Expensive but worth it
I used to love Gari-but not it's become too mayo-ish
I used to like the genuine sushi that Gari made because he was good chef
No need for all these sauces because he's good as he is
I'm so disappointed in the recent changes
A friend told me this was the best sushi restaurant in New York
He was wrong
The sushi is good, and extremely unique and inventive, but far from amazing
I was extremely impressed with the selection of fish however
I highly recommend ordering the chef special sushi dish
The quality of the fish hardly compares to the likes of Nobu or Japonica
The eel was a disappointment and the salmon was fishy
For the money, there are better places out there to go for sushi
This is by far the best and most creative sushi in the city
Let Gari work his magic and order the specialities that aren't on the menu
Make a reservation and arrive a little early, they're ALWAYS packed, and waiting to be seated can be a cramped experience, (but worth it!)
If you've got the money and don't mind being packed in like sardines - then cozy on up to the Sushi Bar (much better than a table) and let Gari work his Omikase magic
Some of the things were really unique!
Found out about this sushi haven via Zagat and visited for the first time last night
Reservations were made less than a week in advance and we were seated about 5 minutes after we arrived
This is, hands down, the best sushi I have had the privilege of eating in NYC
and on an evening when our waiter confided that the fish market being closed the previous day precluded them having fish as fresh as they'd like (honesty I appreciate) but relatively fresh nonetheless!! From the silky smooth, rich toro to the delicate kanpachi to Gari's choice, 10-12 pieces of creatively prepared, novel combinations that will leave you speechless, they could do no wrong
If this wasn't as fresh as they have normally, I anxious await a return trip when they feel satisfied!
The sushi at sushi gari is phenomenal
This is the way to eat sushi
I recommend ordering Gari's special
I'ts a bit pricey, but well worth it
Only negative point
once you eat at gari's you will not want to eat regular sushi
Eating Sushi of Gari was a life changing experience for me
The only problem with gari is that once you eat there it is hard to go back anywhere else

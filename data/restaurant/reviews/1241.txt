the bbq sauce was excellent
the onion rings ok only
pulled pork ok only
catfish good but could use a bit of flavor
sides were good
overall, ok but i would not make a special trip there
We took two visitors from England and it was superb
We had the onion rings - sweet and done right
Green bean salad was tasty but could have used a bit more of a kick  Baby backs - Wow! Meat wasn't fall-off-the bone (a sign of over-cooking) but was tender and had deep flavor
Texas ribs - Tasty
Touch more dense than I was expecting
Not melt in your mouth but very good
Smoked Turkey - Tasty - needed the sauce
Pulled pork - Terrific!  Yams - delicious
Lima beans and Collard Greens could have used more flavor but were enjoyable
Mac and cheese - Good
Cornbread - Good
Service - Great waiter
Friendly and attentive
Good value
Will be back again
Perfect place to take visitors, especially foreigners
No where in the world can you get this food and Bone Lick Park represents it well!  Enjoy
Good grub, great BBQ, beer
Great Outdoor Sidewalk Seating!
the perfect addition to the neighborhood
Thank-you!
The Scene Sandwiched between a brick wall and glass block, the interior benefits from an ultra-minimalist decor of dark woods and pale tabletops
A team of chefs craft their masterpieces in full view of after-work tugged ties and neighborhood foodies
Servers can be tentative, but offer friendly, helpful suggestions with encouragement
The Food Masatoshi "Gari" Sugio's western outpost perpetuates his reputation for eclectic sushi and successfully expands it into cooked dishes
For appetizers, the satisfying crunch of crab and shrimp spring rolls competes only with its own luscious pairing of baby leeks and wood ear mushrooms
Octopus ceviche is a sweet and tangy revelation, bathed in passion fruit juice and finished with a kick of chipotle
Sushi standouts include buttery salmon nigiri, and signature baked Kumamoto oysters
For entrees, lean and tender duck breast is deliciously drizzled in a balsamic teriyaki, and oven roasted lobster is enlivened by tarragon butter
been 3 times -the bar is the better experience - surprising dishes, very creative combinations
This is a non traditional, non blah and not your everyday shushi/sashime combo
One great 2003 Nelms Cabarnet ( x3 the cost of wine store); yes, it is not cheap but one can say the same about Prada
Speak slowly and clearly to the waitress and repeat, yet still don't count that u were understood
A few days ago, I tried Gari sushi at the bar for the 1st time
All raw ingredients as Tuna, Salmon, White fishes, Mackerel, Avalone, Giant clam and Squid etc
were exceptionally fresh that now I understand why they charged the 1st class price without hesitancy
Although some of them were too much salted for me, the way the sushi chefs mixed their special Gary style sauces/toppings with the best quality raw materials was fantastic
The harmony of those and small piece of rice gave me a joy
Don't expect traditional sushi, I would say they are taste-amplified sushi
Finally, some drawbacks were: the restaurant was so small that servers walked right behind, toooo noisy to have conversation, poor list of alcohol, and the price that reminded me sushi was not everyday-low-price
Not sure why there were ever any negative reviews
The sushi and food in general were some of the best I've had in the city (and I've tried most of the top-rated sushi restaurants in the city)
One of our appetizers came out late, but the server was very apologetic and really tried to make amends
The same night I saw Paul Giamatti from Sideways and Serena Altchul, former MTV news anchor
Honestly, the Upper West Side needs a restaurant like this - one that actually values food and service
This restaurant is trying hard to please
Every dish is reviewed by the chef before it comes to your table, the presentation is beautiful and the sushi is absolutely delicious
However it is confusing if you want to order just sushi rolls and not a main dish
Really the chef will put whatever you want in your roll, and you should trust the chef because they know what they're doing! But don't expect exciting rolls to be listed on the main menu
There is a seperate menu with plain rolls that they don't even give you when they give you the regular menu
I would go back and only order sushi next time
It's not as expensive as other reviews have complained about
we are big fans of the UES location
went to this new location about a month ago for the omakase
good but a bit disappointing (especially w/ the ceviche starter)
just went back for the omakase again
this time we were really impressed
we asked for a combination of sashimi and sushi
received items not available before even at UES location
all pieces extremely fresh w/ really tasty sauces that made us smile
unfortunately, we got salmon sashimi after requesting no salmon
we did pay a price for the experience though - over $100 each just for the omakase
The location is great, the ambience is not bad
The service and food are not japanese in any sense of the word
I specifically noted I did not eat meat nor lobster or eel and was presented with each of those from the omakase meal
This restaurant is relying on what they feel is market price for sushi in the area riding on the coat tails of their other restaurant
They do not care about the customer or have that japanese quality of actually caring about the work or presentation they do
They are purely in a business
It is not about the food or experience here
Please do not waste your money
Incredible excitement at expecting the success of the UES Gari to translate into an equally fine experience at the new UWS outpost was completely dashed in one over-priced, underwhelmed visit
Paid over $100 for a light dinner for 2 (this included one beer) and the only thing that was exceptional about the special Omakase Sushi we ordered was how Gari dared serve anything less than exquisitely fresh and sublimely-executed sushi at $65 for 10 small pieces
This adventurous foodie duo found some of the selections downright bizarre and unpalatable (keep your napkin handy for the pale green, jello-like substance with the sliver of dark green down the center)
Never again!
My experience at Gari was amazing
The appetizers packed a punch of flavor and the sushi was some of the freshest and most unique I've tasted
All was uniquely prepared -- no additional soy or wasabe necessary
All were dressed perfectly and presented like little works of art
True, the price isn't cheap, but for such quality and flavor it's worth it
They had a great selection of first-press sakes that were considerably sweeter and smoother than the usual varieties
Our server was eager to assist us and knowledgeable about all of the dishes
Upper Westsiders should be more than pleased with this new addition to their neighborhood!
GARI feels like the UES Sushi of Gari's older sister, the one who went away to college and acquired that poise and polish that prepares them for the real world
Outstanding sushi
fluke with plum sauce, blue fin tuna with tofu sauce, sea urchin with shiso tempura
Do not mistake this for your average, cheap neighborhood sushi joint
My omakase included ten ample pieces of the best fish/seafood treated with creative flair
From the kitchen the lobster spring rolls, monkfish liver mousse and the octopus ceviche appetizers were well-presented and flavorful
The lobster and duck were excellent, as was the cozy himachi casserole
I will definitely go back, but only with my most deserving friends
I don't want to crowd the dining room with anyone who doesn't know the value of an excellent piece of sushi or inventive appetizers/entrees at this glowing Upper West Side gem
What a shame - the Gari on the eastside is so great, and this one is such a disaster
The cramped space, horrendous service, and overpriced menu made our dinner a huge dissapointment
There is no way to maneuver around - everyone knocks food off tables, steps on eachother's feet, and gets really claustrophobic

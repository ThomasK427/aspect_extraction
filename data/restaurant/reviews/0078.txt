Just getting the eel is well worth the long wait
Get there early or late for dinner
The dinner rush is pretty hectic
Just don't tell too many people and keep this the best kept sushi secret!
I love Yuka!!! Very fresh sushi, cute and friendly waitresses, very cheerful sushi chefs, and VERY CHEAP
Despite the long wait at times, the food and value is well worth it! The waitresses are so friendly and how sweet is it when all the sushi chefs greet you on your way in! $18 all you can eat of fresh sushi!! $11 chirashi?? Fresh sushi - too good to be true
I frequent it once a week at least!
i frequent Yuka once a week when i lived in the uppereast
their sushi are always very fresh
service is very friendly
the best value is the all you can eat for $18
($25 tax and tips)
i suggest the Sushi bar seating for quicker service and theater-liked performance by the chefs
Yuka is definitely one of the best Japanese Sushi joint in the city when it comes to value and quality
i am going to miss eating there when i relocate to Boston
Yuka is fantastic, although since the Cheap Eats article in New York Magazine, this place has been pouring with the East Side Yuppie Yups
They used to stay out for fear that it was not posh enough
Thanks to NY Mag, they are flooding what used to be the best kept secret around
So, BRAVO, anyway to Yuka - they are the friendliest, the freshest and just an all around PERFECT 10!
I only have a few words to describe YUKA
Fresh, Mouth-watering, Filling, and CHEAP
Yeah!!!! That's right
Incomparable to other Japanese Restaurants they offer friendly service and a wide variety of fishes sliced ever so nicely to make your sushi experience something to remember
Take the hint
Cheap and Mouth-watering! Get your bottom on the 6 train and Oh!
Watch out for the origami on the ceiling! Have a great time! I know I did
=)
We are from Philadelphia and visited Yuka on the recommendation of a friend
It was great! I believe that the sushi is pretty fresh and an excellent value for $18!! We drive to NY just to eat here sometimes! If we lived in NY, we would probably eat here once a week
Great service, the place is small and packed though, so don't expect much romance
The only think that would make this place better would be if were BYOB
Alas, life is not perfect, but Yuka sure comes close
Yuka is a great neighborhood sushi bar and the all-you-can eat for $18 is fantastic
I've been going for years and highly recommend it
I love going to Yuka and sittinng at the sushi bar
The sushi chefs are very friendly
We love this restaurant and come back time after time
Great small place with very affordable prices great rolls and sashimi
One of the few bargains in the city
All you can eat sushi for the budget conscience without the scarifies
Great for a party of 7 or less
Eat your heart out!
In Short This trendy open-air restaurant on the corner of Union Square Park is always packed with a diverse young crowd
The menu features a variety of Asian preparations
Offerings include the Harvest Delight salad of eggplant, sweet peppers, string beans, carrots and cashews
Also available is eggplant in garlic sauce, the Zen vegi-burger, with sunflower seeds, kale and brown rice, and curry-rice-noodle soup
Don't go here if you are not a vegetarian or not open to having a meal with out meat
Once you get past that, this place is wonderful
The prices are pretty good and the food is great
I highly recommend the sweet potato fries and the highly addictive Sweet and Sour Sensation
I'm not a vegetarian
My roommate is though, and we went to Zen Palate together
She loved her dish and would probably recommend it to others
But I would have been happier ordering yakisoba from a regular Japanese restaurant
It was fresh, tasted reasonably well, but what's with the thick wheat noodles? That yakisoba was offered on the menu at all was special as many Japanese restaurants do not
This is a testament to the menu selection at Zen Palate
If you're like me and going to dinner to satisfy the soy and tofu cravings of the vegetarian(s) in your life, you're bound to find something on the menu to order
But if you plan to have dinner with a group of carnivores, skip Zen Palate and head for the steak house for some good old fashioned meat
Just be sure to rub your belly for good luck afterwards!
I made reservations days earlier, arrived with friends, and headed up to the 2nd floor for our reservation
Only then did we realize that we were handed a different menu with high prices and unappetizing selections
I requested the downstairs menu and was told they could not accomodate
I then complained that I was not told that we would be upstairs and that I was also not told that the menus differed
The waitress did nothing
She just stood there staring at us
I asked if we could be reseated downstairs only to hear that we would have to wait over 2 hours for a table
OK, right, after making reservations, I really want to do that
They were unapologetic, rude and hauty
Ok, it's not greasy steak and juicy burger good, but it's a light healthy fare, if you are into that kind of stuff
Just because this is vegetarian, don't think everything is bland and made out of tofu, it's actually pretty good
You'll find good curry dishes and their fries (made out of sweet potato) is to die for
If you are into anything packed with carbs, go ahead and sin for just one night
ask for their scallion pancakes
Whatever you do, don't order desserts
Their desserts are not worth it
It's like if you are going to consume all the fat and calories anyway, you should at least eat something that is REALLY worth it
Yes, once in a while you'll want to substitue non-fat ice cream for the full-blown Haggen Daaz, but you know, it's never really satisfy you like the way it should
The food is very tasty
my recommendation
try the Sweet and Sour Sensation!  The service could be better
they aren't as attentive as they could be, but the prices are great, and so is the food
And the portions are perfect!  Additionally, the types of people who go there are unpretenious and cool
You rarely have to wait for a table
Great selection of vegetarian food
The wonton soup was AMAZING and the view of Union Square was lovely too!
The upside of Zen Palate is the open kitchen, which allows you to watch the cooks at work and removes fears of who only knows what the chefs are doing in the back
The food is decent, some dishes much better than others
Weekends are usually packed with long waits
Otherwise a good spot to go for a meal with a friend on an afternoon while hanging out at the nearby Barnes and Noble or taking in a show at the nearby theatres
I've eaten at this Zen Palate location a few times, and each time have had the same reaction- I feel the food's sub-par, but decide to give it another chance and order something else
Well, after today's experience, I'll never visit this place again
While the design of the space and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable (with a great view of Union Square), the food has once again proved to be less than favorable and the service mediocre
Our server was almost absent, and made a poor recommendation
The sauces were too salty and gooey, with little additional flavor
The vegetables were fairly bland- it's tough to eat pink tomatoes when right across the street they sell bright red, tasty ones at the farmer's market! Don't give this place a chance, unless you're just going for appetizers
There are many more enjoyable places to get a decent vegetarian meal!
I am a proud carnivore so imagine my apprehension to try this vegetarian cuisine place
My experience was okay as it was hit and miss
The spring rolls are great, tastes like any other rolls with meat filling and I had the soy protein ham dish (bad idea)
Tried the noodles from my friend's plate and it was fine

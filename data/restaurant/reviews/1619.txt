The wine is in general a good deal and they have some interesting choices
The room is dark and smokey, but it's the real deal
The live jazz is a nice touch, as long as you aren't sitting too close
Jules is a great place in a fun neighborhood - for dinner with friends or a date
Try the patio/sidewalk seating in the summer
After living in Lyons as a little girl, I miss the cozy restaurants with relaxed waiters, quality ingredients, and warm service
Jules may be on St
Mark's, often crowded, and near the NYU buzz, but only an absolute moron would have something negative to say about this place
Yes! You can SMOKE
YES! You can eat a full meal with wine for under 30 bucks a person
Yes! They have great local jazz and three piece nsembles certain evenings
And YES! The wine list is not imaginative, but rock solid
The food has always been pleasant at Jules
The service is unnoticed (neither in a good or bad way)
The wine is a little too much for what you get true
But the nicest part about Jules is the setting, especially when the jazz band is playing
I'll be up-front, this is the worst restaurant I have ever been in
Appalling is being kind
Firstly the place was so dark you couldn't see your food, the waiter initially spoke with a french accent but when my wife engaged him in a conversation en francais it became clear he wasn't french
The food was mediocre and over priced, the service was rude, the final insult was that after having left more than $300 in cash (no credit cards) we were asked to leave
These guys should go to France and see what a real French restaurant consists of
They are insult to the restaurant trade and French gastronomie
They are more interested in separating you from your cash than in providing quality service and food
Avoid at all costs
Jules is one of my favourite New York french restaurants
I always take visiting friends here - and they have all had the same opinion
This place a real gem, the menu is typically french, so too is the wine list - and the staff very attentive
Great in the summer evenings, but call early for the outside table
The worst dining experience I've ever had in NYC
After telling the waiter that he brought my girlfriend the wrong meal, he got angry, saying, Are you saying that there is a problem with my hearing??? Result: We ate the wrong meal in fear of him spitting in the new one
no tip
never going back
Been coming here for years
Good spot to get hearty French fare and catch live jazz on Sundays
There's a nice little outdoor area out front too
The food can be variable, but it's mostly solid
All the requisite French road signs etc
are on the walls
You can usually walk in and get a table, except for peak hours
The Scene NYU students flock to this semi-legendary diner, though what was once an archetypal greasy spoon has lost some of its rough charm with a renovation; on the other hand, the space does feel cleaner and more pleasant
Service tends to be more focused on clearing tables than pleasing customers
The Food This traditional diner menu includes one of New York's biggest burgers--the inch-thick Cozy burger, which weighs in at nine ounces
While it will satisfy size queens, the meat quality is average and the rapid cooking time--plates arrive less than five minutes after ordering--doesn't do much for juiciness or flavor
Soups are thick and flavorful, though light on prime ingredients (chicken noodle, for example, comes with a lot more noodle than chicken)
A wide variety of other diner foods--salads, sandwiches, breakfast, steak, etc
--are also available
Cozy's is one of the great Greek-American owned diners in New York City
Here the burgers are as tasty as they are huge, yet they never rank in best of new york lists because the setting is an ordinary diner and not a gimmicky hipster hole in the wall
The food is average, the seating a little cramped, but at 4 am, this is the place to be
No matter what time, there are always people here and fast food
The menu is extensive, with more than ten ways to serve a salad, breakfast all day, and good burgers
The service isn't wonderful, but hey, its a diner, and we don't have enough of them in New York
The worst overall experience I've had in the city
The host and hostess actually yelled at someone at my table from the front door! Unprofessional
Uncomfortable
Mediocre food on top of it
Just have to say that when it comes to Burgers, this is the King!! I have had this Burger in all of it's different styles the has to offer
The Biggest!! I have nothing else to say
This place has good burgers and fries
I thought their soup was too salty though
We just finished what was without question one of the worst meals ever
The burgers and fries were dried out and tasteless, most particluarly for the price $10 each! crazy!
Cozy's Soup Burger is the one and only buger joint I hit up when I go to New York
The burgers even beat out L
A
burgers
The soups are great, my favorite is the slit pea soup
If I could have them delivered to California I would do it in a snap
HUGE, tasty burgers
Typical dinner ambience, with great, fast service
Gotto love Cozy's!
I love Cozy Soup Burger
They rock
The service is always great
They are open 24 hours a day, and best of all-- you can get breakfast ANY time of the day
Get there soon for one of their monster burgers, and definitely bring a buddy and your appetite
have never had a better burger - anywhere! so juicy and so HUGE!
The burgers and the best and the biggest of them all
It's a good clean place, good prices, great food, nice staff
The atmosphere is great
It's located near NYU, so there's always a young group
It's lively, but not loud
Great at any hour of the day
The best burger can be had here at 4am
9 oz
of juicy and succulent beef can satisfy and heal those cravings for something familiar and comfortable
The generous portion of beef with a cup of clam chowder is enough to hold you over while you stroll around east village and Washington Square Park
I've always had pleasant experiences at Cozy, from huge salads to big, juicy burgers, or late night coffee and delicious pie, this place is awesome
The staff is very nice and helpful too
Great after a night of barhopping
this food is consistently decent, and it's a great place to go to after partying all night
the staff is friendly, and the wait for a table is never long
The burgers here are the best I've had in the city -- bar none
There is a wide variety of burger choices and all are well-prepared and predictably tasty
The service sometimes seems a little hurried, but that's a small price to pay for burgers this good
I live around the corner from Mumbles, and it has consistently been a fantastic, fun and comfortable destination
Their menu has plenty of options-from burgers pizza to strawberry brie salads chicken pesto sandwiches
The prices are outstanding for the qulaity of food
Their large outdoor area is perfect for people watching and hanging out
It's nothing fancy, but you can go come here for a quiet brunch or on a Friday night with friends and it will always fit the bill

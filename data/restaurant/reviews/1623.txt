Although the Elephant is trumped as a French/Thai place I feel that most of the dishes are french with some ever so slight asian infusions while other dishes are just plain thai
It is not so much a fusion of the two cuisines as a restaurant that offers two different types of food
That being said, The Elephant has EXCELLENT food
The Duck confit came with mashed yams (with crystalized caramel in it) and a bed of sauteed greens
The summer roll appetizer I had was pretty standard
My dining companion had the bass which was delicous as well
Drinks are very inventive, cocktails moreso than wines
Dessert was delicious and creative
Service was excellent
The Elephant is always packed and I had never known why
Now I do
The secret is excellent food and service at great value prices
Arrived with 3 friends on a Sat
night with a reservation and had to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes
Space was so tiny and cramped that we must have gotten shoved back and forth at the bar area every 2 minutes by people walking in and out
The restaurant is just not well designed and there isn't enough space to be comfortable
If you are claustophobic this is not the restaurant for you
Once seated, they had to entirely pull out our table for people to wedge in behind it to be seated and you can't get out without moving the entire table - very inconvenient
Space aside, service is ok but the food is really well done
Crab cakes, pad thai, fish, etc were all delicious and very flavorful
Would definitely go back on a week night when crowds are (hopefully) not as bad
Beem digging The Elephant for over 5 years
I had not been there in about 3 years, though, so I looked up the reviews here
I was really worried after all of the bad service reports, but I was very happy to recieve prompt, competent service and impeccable food
I think this place must get too busy at times and the staff has failed to handle things decently, but we got them at a good time: the end of summer just before school starts is a traditionally slow time for restaurants
Also, hopefully, whatever caused their poor performances before may have been addressed at last
All I can say is that I've always had a blast there and just now was no exception
Sometimes being too poplular can ruin a spot, but there is a reason why The Elephant gets so packed: a great product
RUDE, RUDE, RUDE
Got my order wrong - twice and then stopped trying - never brought my food out
It was a special occasion and we should have chosen another place
Tight, cramped space where you can't even put your purse down as you are packed in like sardines
Awful experience
These guys need to get over the french attitude
I've been going to The Elephant for years now and have always loved it
I recently went with an 8:30 reservation for 3 on a Saturday
The manager/host person was very rude, unhelpful, and after waiting an hour he promised us the very next table
which he then proceeded to give to someone else
Needless to say, we left
However, the food here is fantastic
It is very flavorful and exotic, unlike any other place I've been
The pork chops are probably the best I've had anywhere! If you can deal with some pretentious unfriendly service, I would recommend this place
the horrible manager and waitress hurried us through the entire meal, were ridiculously rude and unfriendly
we felt stressed as we ate in 20 minutes
when i left a tip of
50 less than 15% of the meal, (because that's what she deserved), the waitress actually chased me out of the restaurant and demanded the rest of her tip
i gave her $5 more and walked away shocked at my own wimpiness
eat here if you you'll suck up poor service for decent food
the chef's decent, too bad he/she is so badly represented up front
We had reservations and when we showed up the manager told us the wait was over 45 mins
He was rude and crazy
Not only that, he lied when I spoke to him the phone
He said that we should be on time because they have a strong policy about being late
Elephant was crowded and people were pushing each other around
Finally we left and went to a place next door
5 friends from europe were in town
We ordered dinner
My duck came and the server spilled hot greasy sauce all over my lap and my friends' lap
Manager apologized, offered to pay for dry cleaning, but nothing else
Throughout the night it was tough to get drink orders in as well
At end of the night, I tipped $35 on $300 bill
We left the restaurant and were chased out to the street where the manager said why was the tip so low - i mean, i know about the duck and I said that's it- the duck and he said I offered to pay for dry cleaning and I said you just did
he embarrassed himself, he embarrassed me, and he painted a terrible picture of new yorkers at a time when USA needs all the good PR from Europeans it can get
One of the most terrible dining experiences I have ever had! From the moment my party walked in the door, the owner of the restaurant was rude and for lack of a better word, mean
He was heard yelling at numerous people in the place, and actually told my friend to shut up
We had a reservation for 6 people at 8:30 and didn't get seated until almost 10pm
Our waitress was nice and the service was quick, and I should say that the food was great, but the owner ruined it all! I would not recommend this place unless it is 2:00 in the afternoon, and you were the only customers in the place
And even then, the owner might just decide to yell and curse at you for no reason! DO NOT go if you are more than 4 people
you'll wait forever!
My first visit here was divine, mostly because I was willing to look past the tight space and focus on the food
The salmon tartar was de-lish as was the Chilean sea bassevery bite revealed a new texture and flavor
I couldnt wait to go back
However I soon realized my rush in judgment upon my second and albeit last visit, when I had the misfortune of meeting the owner
being rude to patrons is ill advised
To illustrate, he chose not to honor my dinner reservations and then he sat my party of 5 at a table suitable only for 4
When I thought it couldnt get any worsehe surprises me by laughing in our faces
He was not accommodating at all and the handful of dishes I sampled that night failed to compare to anything you would find elsewhere in the city for less than half the price
A great place for a laid-back first date
It is crowded and noisy, but the food is good and if someone doesn't like the communal feel then I don't want to date them anyway
Beware
this place is terrible when it comes to service
Came here for a b-day and ended up waiting so long even for a reservation
The waitress was rude and not courteous at all
The manager is disgustingly obnoxious
Guess people were not wrong when they say French people are rude
The food is not worth the price nor the service at all
Do not attempt to eat here at all !!!
My bf took me here on our 2nd date and I was hooked after that
Maybe its not someone's ideal quiet, stare into each other's romantic setting but it has that exotic, smoky-sexy, fun type of ambiance
The food is my favorite
I can't get enough it
I ordered 3 entrees one time because I just couldn't decide (don't get me wrong they are pretty big dishes) and made my bf help me finish it all
The owner is great and the service is great
I've been going there monthly for the last two years and have not had a bad experience
This place can be a total blast if you're in the right mood
I'd never before been to a place where your table is actually touching the person's next to you, but this makes between-table conversation almost a necessity! You end up having a party with the other people there! The food was great too, very interesting stuff
It can get kinda loud, so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you have a lot to talk about
Come for the atmosphere and yummy French-Thai food! P
S
It definitely helps if you speak (decent) French to the owner

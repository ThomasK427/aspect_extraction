Every time I go, they never cease to disappoint me
The duck is the BEST dish, but EVERYTHING is also VERY, VERY GOOD! Service is exceptional
The staff always go the extra mile in everything
GREAT CHEF/OWNER (PAOLO)! GREAT SERVER/HOST (ALEX)!
The $10
95 brunch with all you can drink mimosas and bloody mary's were reason enough to entice me
Once I sat down and tasted the food, I wondered why I hadn't tried it sooner
The food is amazing and generous portions
The waiter was excellent
I love this place and am going back for dinner tonight!
If you are looking for an intimate place with fabulous food, Basso Est is your answer
This is a restaurant filled with friendly staff and a menu with appetizers and entrees which make your mouth water just thinking about them
Over some complimentary burschetta, my date and I were able to narrow down which culinary masterpiece would be ours for the night
Not one dissapointment during the entire meal! We sipped delicious wines from the excellent wine list and never felt rushed one minute
Even though my date spilled some olives down his shirt, the evening was first class from start to finish!
I went with friends for a good glass of wine the bartender was sweet and courteous and suggested a nice sicilian wine,hmm really scrumptuos immediately prompted with a complimentary tasty bruschetta
Then from the kitchen i heard some jokes and laugh that sounded really italian so i coudn't resist the temptation and had some tender and jucy grilled calamari a nice soft buffalo mozzarella and one of my frends tried the Lamb we ate it with our hands -yummy
We ende up having a good bottle of wine from the very well priced lots to choose from list and felt really home
Great hosts and tasty food
I raccommend it
This small restaurant is really a gem on the east side
The food is awesome, and you get a lot for your dollar
The pasta is always good, but I would recommend the roasted chicken
To top things off, the service is extremely friendly and there are a bunch of local bars in the area
PAY ATTENTION:  If you are looking for a GREAT meal at a moderate PRICE
RUN
do not walk
to BASSO
For a small,intimate experience where the FOOD is CENTER STAGE, but the SERVICE and PERSONAL TOUCH still SHINE through make BASSO your choice
Thanks, Paolo,Ellen and Alex
continued success
This small place is a must go! The small bar with slate counter and white cloth tables are adorable
To top it off the wait staff is awesome and they give you brushetta for free as soon as you sit down! Everything on the menu is great
I cant wait to go back!
I'm actually so excited about Basso Est that I can't keep it as a secret even so I promised it to my friends
I haven't had such a good experience for years: everything was excellent from amuse guelle to free drink on the house at the end
High class and moderate prices!
Went here for Sunday brunch and had a great meal with all-you-can-drink mimosas
Great service and a nice atmosphere
Basso Est is a lower east side gem!! Stumbled upon it on a Friday night and was almost immediately seated
The food is great and considering the portions, very affordable
But what makes this such a great place is the staff
The hostess, the bartender, the waiters -- all genuinely nice
Highly recommend!!
The perfect place for a date- so intimate (and plenty of space)
the food is so amazing and the prices are even better! Summer will be even better with their french doors wide open
Definitely put in on your list to visit
The Scene A fine blend of style and substance, this large, modern space is accented with a mahogany bar, carved teak screens, sandstone statues and sexy lighting, most of it imported from India
But this is no theme restaurant: The food and atmosphere are infused with the exotic, rather than overpowered by it
Soft banquettes and pillow-laden booths enhance a refreshingly mellow vibe, and the shift from eatery to lounge is organic
The Food The kitchen has created a changing menu of upscale French and New American dishes with Indian touches
Tandoori-style red snapper is delicately flavored with mushroom ghee; pan-roasted lobster tops deliciously aromatic basmati rice; and the wild-greens salad is hopping with chaat masala
Portions are small, so you'll have room for some wild berry "samosas" afterward
I went to Taj on 7/27/2006 with a group of girlfriends and had a good time
The lounge space is great if you get there early
Unfortunately the air conditioning/music lighting were all off due to a power failure but was resolved pretty quickly by NYC standards
They take all the couches off the floor once it gets crowded, so there isn't much seating
Happy Hour went well and the bartenders were friendly
The music that night was a little too old for my preference, but it was an older crowd, so they have to cater to them
The people were pretty much cool, just friends meeting up to hang
no drama or pretentious people here
I would rate the establishment average since I didn't feel the space, food, drinks were spectacular or different from other places I've visited
It is also next to Duvet and other clubs in case you get bored
My only advice is to get there early so you can enjoy happy hour and just chilling out before the afterwork crowd comes in
Finally, the food was nothing to write home about
It was expensive and from the looks of what people ordered, quite plain and unappealing
I was here for 2 different birthday parties, and both times enjoyed myself
Being on the list at the door, a very short wait and got in no problem
The place fills up at night, a bit crowded walking through everyone dancing to get to the bathrooms
I was able to go up to the loft for the birthday parties, which was great since it didn't fill up and overlooks the main bar area
Music was a popular mix of modern dance which everyone enjoyed
A younger mid 20s crowd it seemed
The bartender in the loft area was very friendly and social (and cute), as was the bathroom attendant who directs traffic in the hall to the bathrooms
Overall I've enjoyed myself here both Saturday nights
After we tried out two Thai places in the row
We headed to the great indian food at Taj
We were in love in this place
It was very good indian food
great service and decor
well done
Great, inventive food
Nice atmosphere, comfortable, and polite and attentive servers
Definitely recommend
the food was amazing
service amazing
atmosphere was amazing
drinks were amazing
the live music was amazing
the feeling in the air was amazing
only problem is that I got the lobster and was still hungry afterwards
My husband got the duck and was full and satisfied
I have to admit i have dated many woman here
they all went home happy
the lunge was cool and the decor was nice
how ever food was average
drinks were good over all B-
This past Friday night was my friends B-day
She wanted to go to a really chill place With lots of hot people and great music
I suggested Taj, and let me tell you we had a blast
With the sexy bartenders and the cute Waiters

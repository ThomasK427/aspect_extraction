Unfortunately, we received very slow and poor service from the moment we entered the restaurant
The sushi was okay at best
Lack of taste and lack of originality
The seaweed balled up as if eating processed cheese with the package still on it
We were charged for four beers even though we only had two
Making this clear to the waiter was a challenge of its own
All in all, not good
Forget the snooty joints like Nobu and Tao
This place is elegant, with first rate service
It's quiet too
Aside from the welcoming atmosphere, the sushi and sake are the best I've had in the City
Bursting with freshness, the fish is a must-try
Especially the mackerel sushi
The prices are very reasonable too
Highest recommendation for this place!
This place won Most Romantic in Village Voice's Best of New York, well I dont know about romantic, but it sure was filling! I had the chicken kebab and I loved it, my boyfriend is a very picky eater he hardly ever eats out and he had the baby lamb and was very satisfied
Their service surprised me the most, it is very rarely that a restaurant in New York is as hospitable and attentive as Ithaka
I will definately return
My only gripe is that they are a bit expensive but it is well worth it!
Outstanding authentic Greek restaurant, with wonderfully fresh seafood and a charming ambience
They have done it AGAIN!! The Greek team of Sam Harry have successfully transported Ithaka from their Village location to the Upper East side
Most importantly, they have not lost their touch -- the authentic Greek dishes combined with the fresh fish and a little slice of the home country make this a great evening
A little Greek oasis in Manhattan! The authentic dishes, fresh catch-of-the-day seafood selection, warm homemade bread, excellent prices, and relaxed friendly atmosphere temporarily transported us from NYC to a small tarverna on a Greek island
Nice atmosphere, good service, delicious food, good menu selection
We really enjoyed our meal and were pleased by the dishes on the menu
The ambiance is lovely
Just thinking about Spada's incredible homemade pasta makes my mouth water! It's my favorite place to go in the neighborhood because it consistently offers great food and great service
The only thing I can't understand is why they keep changing the name?!
Both Barmen are T-total! They need to have their wits about them, as the crowed in here while never violent tends to be at best compleatly insane! Populated by Irish folk, this drink only pub, has a great (if slight exspensive) pool table at the back a huge mps player jukebox linked to the internet, and good guniess
As the night wears on I have witnessed 70 year old irsh men drop their pants and walk around with them around their feet, disco dancing taxi drivers, Physco Indian girls who want to sing and talk to the whole bar, intense pool games, rounds of drink brought for the whole house by wasted individules
If you want a place to have a drink before you head home to Her Indoors then this is the place
If you want to stay longer than 15 mins the watch out!
We were here for lunch and were seated promptly in the bright, comfortable dining room
Service was prompt, attentive and friendly
The food was good
A great choice!
We found this little gem in our travel guide for NYC
The first time there was magical, a warm, rainy night with a great table for two
Several tables over were guards from the Metropolitain Mueseum and the neighborhood regulars
Good Italian food but ask for the first floor, we went back again and were seated in a hot room upstairs with no atmosphere or air conditioning
The staff and management are very helpful and fun
Tried the Caffe after visiting The Met
The Caffe was recommended by a doorman down the street
We sat at one of the two tables located near the window
Found everything to be very solid
The food, the wine and the staff are very good
Not a standout, but a nice quiet place to enjoy good food and good company
Fantastic setting in a comfy townhouse - and the food was great
The waiters and others were as friendly as can be
a great surprise
I love this place! The decor is very seventies and a little tacky
The T-bone and Coconut Shrimp are the best
Everything come with baked potato and salad
The price is very reasonable
This is a grab a tray and order kind of place
Good value for the food
Decor is auwful
It is a self service restaurent
Came here on a Saturday night
Wonderful atmosphere, excellent food
The ceviche is positively sublime
The skirt steak and short ribs are also especially good
Menu is a bit pricey but some of the best Mexican food I've had in the city so worth it
A bit crowded- our table was a little too small for our party, the plates hardly fit
All in all, a great dining experience
The crabmeat tamales are to die for as well as the guacamole
Definitely will go back next time I am in town
Wait staff was fun and energetic
Definitely better than most of the Mexican restaurants in town, including most of the more hyped ones that cost more
Creative, tasty dishes, decent drinks and reasonable prices
Zocalo is our favorite restaurant ! We love Chef Medina's daily specials and his menu is long and diverse
Mexican food isn't just burritos and tacos! He uses the best of seasonal ingredients and adds his magic touch
We love the ceviches, foie gras tacos and his steamed cod
The chocolate molten cake is heavenly!!!
I understand what David Rosengarten meant when he called Chef Julian Medina a genius, a starchef waiting in the wings
Medina clearly uses very authentic ingredients, but gives his Mexican dishes an innovative twist that creates a symphony on the tastebuds
The food is not only superb, but truly inspired! The atmosphere is fun and  the decor is lively without being contrived (as are so many hip places these days)
And what amazed us is that it is as perfect for a date as for family experience
Muy bien!
I have to say, ever since Chef Julian Medina (formerly of Maya) took over the kitchen I can't get enough of this place
The food is wonderful and unique
The guacamole flight is exceptional and specials are incredible
I advise all to try the specials, they seem to change their specials often ( I went during their Corn Festival and the specials menu was exotic without being pretentious!) FANTASTIC!
Zocalo is one of the best restaurants on the Upper Eastside
The drinks are fantastic and the food is delicious
This is a great place for groups and to bring out-of-town guest
I loved the meal I had here
The margaritas were great the guac was wonderful - try the tasting - and the enchiladas were amazing
My husband had the Kobe tacos and I had the chicken enchiladas and they were both outstanding
We also shared the goat cheese, shrimp and pineapple salsa quesadilla as an appetizer and it was very tasty as well
The service was efficient and friendly and I will definitley be going back here many times
Okay, we have been coming to Zocalo for about four years
My favorites: the blood orange margaritas, the hanger steak (so, so good) and tres leche for dessert
I have also been trying some of the specials (especiallly fish)
They have been fantastic
I think they have a new chef and he is trying some different items out
Well worth a visit
If you want tacos and burritos skip Zocalo and go find a Taco Bell or move out to California and eat at El Torito
This is fresh, upscale Mexican cuisine at its best
This will be the best Mexican Restaurant in New York

My husband doesn't like vegetables and made a point to ask the waiter if he could have a side of pasta instead
The waiter said sure
When the bill came, the side of pasta cost us almost $10
When my husband spoke to the manager, the manager apologized that the waiter changed $1
50 too much
Shouldn't the waiter tell us beforehand that there would be a charge? If we bring the matter to the manager, shouldn't he do something other than reduce the charge? Honestly, adding $8
50 for a side of pasta with tomato sauce was a rip off
Don't go
There are a lot of really cute restaurants right across the street!
Have been going here for 12 years, haven't had a bad meal yet
Sometimes service is a little slow and you may have to wait for a table
The waiters are always accomdating and the food is anything but bland
Pasta and veal dishes are exceptional
Salads, even the bread is wonderful
I would highly recommend it
As far as having inconsiderate people at the next table, that can happen at any restaurant in NY
went there for an early business dinner midweek
seated promptly
tables well spaced
air conditioning working- fine air circulation
service almost personalized
waiter's accent was a tad thick
wine served promptly at proper temperature
ordered off the menu- caesar salad was exceptional, pasta and chicken dishes were served quickly at the proper temperature and were fine
coffee below par
prices are wonderful
a very solid place
I went there last night expecting a nice dinner and I did get that
However while I was sitting there eating my dinner, I had 5 girls at the next table screaming, swearing, and just talking about having sex with the manager
And the funniest thing the manager was sitting right there and did nothing
I would recommend the food, but not the restaurant
Worst place I ever ate
We went with my wife's parents and our reservations were honoured without hassle
Service was a bit slow as our waiter could never be found
Food was great, lots of daily specials to choose from
My wife loved her vongole bianco which was loaded with un-shelled clams
Not the most romantic but a good place to take visiting parents
We'll definitely go back
We have been to Bello's on about 8 occasions and have never been disappointed
They have always honored resevervations,food service can't be beat
Price is right
The two people who wrote in below are obviously regulars
Regulars (average age 60-to-dead) are treated well and dont seem to mind the terrible food
I can understand why this place was so badly reviewed
If you are not a regular you are treated with contempt beyond belief
My family had a reservation at 8:00 and we waited at the bar for 30 minutes even though we arrived on time
Another party of four, obviously well loved regulars, arrived without a reservation and was seated immediately
When I complained to the manager and then the owner, I was rudely told to go elsewhere if I didnt like it
The owners breath smelled of wine
My family didnt want trouble so we stayed to taste the terrible, bland food
There are so many Italian restaurants in the neighborhood (two others on the same intersection!) go to any of them over Bello
I have eaten at Bello for years
Never had a bad meal
Don't know why anyone would not like it
Courteous staff, fresh hot food for a reasonable price and never a problem with a reservation before 6:30 pm any weekend
Have had numerous parties and gatherings and they have always been great
Very underrated place and the free parking for the theater afterwards can't be beat!
They had great service, and good quality food
I travel for work and this is a great value breakfast for this part of town
On my next trip I plan stopping in for lunch also
The food is your ave chineese take out but the price is dirt cheep for the area
Highly recomended for people that work in the area and dont want to spend 10 bucks on lunch everyday
It gets very buisy at lunch so you should try calling in your order for pick up so its ready by the time you arive
Now understand I was here an hour after getting engaged, so really, Caffe Cielo could have fed the group rubber chickens and we would have had a great time
well, probably
But Caffe Cielo erased any doubt we had by hosting a terrific, terrific evening
The staff was gracious under fire, as our party ballooned past the 20 we'd anticipated
They gave us custom-made prix-fix menus (Dinner with XXXX XXXX enscripted across the top with wedding bells underneath), at a very reasonable $50/person ($40 without veal as an option)
Service was prompt, the food fantastic (Oprah rightfully raves about the ravioli), the location ideal, and the ambience just right
A beautiful night
The host, MayBelle, and the Caffe Cielo staff were just delightful, and I'll continue to go back time and time again
Don't know about evening, but this is a place where the local entertainment professionals (both tv and music) come to have their lunchs whether for biz or pleasure
The atmosphere is conservative and calm, the service gracious, and the fish dishes are a specialty
Be prepared to drop a hundred bucks for lunch for 4 without all the bells and whistles
This is a good spot for a business lunch
I had one of the worst service experiences in memory having the prix fix brunch there--waving arms, calling, asking two or three times for everything from coffee to the check
Overworked and superficially pleasant but obviously grumpy waitresses responded to my polite complaints at the end by telling me that I should expect poor service given the brunch prices
Not exactly an answer that would endear me to taking guests there, even for expensive dinners where the tips might inspire better treatment
Only good words for Caffe Cielo! Good food, good Martini's and a super friendly staff
The weekend brunch is a delight (at a very reasonable price!)  The crowd is quite interesting also
(we've spotted a few undercover celebs a few good times)
I recently called Caffe Cielo to get some information and was told, BABY, GET TO THE POINT, I AM ON MY LUNCH BREAK  After this unbelievable comment from who I believe was a manager, I must say I was completely turned off and would never dine here
Beautiful restaurant, but the food was mediocre at best
Chicken florentine was overcooked (both spinach and meat) and drowned in a flavourless brown sauce
Ravioli were decent, but if you're paying $15-20 per entree, it should be more than decent
Salads were fresh but dressings lacked interest, and what they call fresh mozzerella bears NO resemblance to the real thing
There are definitely better theatre district restaurants in this price range
I've eaten here three times from Aug 04 to 05 because my friends keep picking it for lunch
But never again
The food is terrible, the prices only so-so, the service is also terrible
We usually wait 20 minutes for food to arrive (cold)
We never get all our food without repeatedly asking for it
We've been charged for items never received
There's no ambience
The only good thing is generous portions
Stumbled upon this place on accident, looking for late night food that wouldn't come with a fast food logo
This place is simply a gem and has a great selection of restaurant quality items on their non-diner looking menu
The service was decent, at 2AM there was still a good amount of people eating and watching TV
The actual interior of the place is nice, which I imagine attracts most of the outsiders to come in
Prices won't kill you, but they are average in comparison to other diners

our waitress couldn't explain or describe the specials to us, and a group of five people seemed to overwhelm her
i would go back again for a second try, but i'd like to see their service improved
otherwise, the'll go down the same river as so many great restaurants downtown
I ate at this restaurant this past Friday night and the waiter we had was completely rude
First, the waiter brought us to a table where people were still finishing their coffee from their meal - he told them the restaurant was busy and they needed to finish now and to pay their bill inside
We tried to order drinks but it took forever
The food was good but the portion didn't even fill the apetite of my girlfriend who eats like a mouse
I ended up getting a slice of pizza afterwards down the street
I didn't realize the bill automatically included a 20% gratuity so I ended up tippng nearly 40% for a 4 person meal
I called the manager to discuss it the next day and he refused to consider my situation
Good Food but just hold on to your wallet when you are there
visiting the retaurant I know as Da Gennaro Ristorante
Ushered in from the street the four others in my party, and I were seated in the back corner near the window
we waited minutes go by and the water comes
we wait, with no menus
In order to get a server and menus we must go talk to the host
The rest of out experience went along the same lines
I ordered a glass of Merlot, I had to ask 3 times for it before a glass was brought to me
filled with white wine
?? I ordered the broccoli rabe, and was served spinach
the food was good when i finally got it, but the service was so bad i would not return to the restuarant
We have been to Da Genero's twice now - both times have been excellent
The waiters are fun and the food was great
Had Fried Zucchini for appetizer and Rigatoni alla Vodka for entree, both were fantastic
I would definitely return
If you are looking for a nice and cheap place to eat at little Italy, this is a good choice
The food is not superb but correct, the location is very convenient and the waiters are very friendly and efficient
Great capuccino

As an incentive to draw me and a friend into the restaurant, the owner's son offered to specially prepare an entree that I wanted that wasn't on the menu--which was great
The waiter, Momir, was on top of everything the whole time-not to mention entertaining us by constantly hitting on the two blond souther girl sitting at the table next to us-- and the free wine and after dinner espressos were much appreciated
Our appetizer, entrees and drinks were all the best I've had in Little Italy
I went to Casa Bella on Saturday night for a late dinner (10pm)
The crowd was lovely and so was the outdoor seating
The menu prices were standard for Little Italy ranging from 15-25 an entree
All the veal entrees were $18
95, yet I chose to order the veal special
Generally speaking, specials are 1
5X menu price, however, when the check arrived the veal was a startling $35
00
It wasn't any different from a typical veal scalloppini and the portion was not especially large
I asked another waiter to confirm the price of the special, and he quoted me $32
50
When I spoke to our waiter about the price discrepancy, he refused to address our grievance, and did not apologize
Poor Service and sub-par food didn't do justice to the crowd or the atmosphere
This place was a rip-off
There could not have been a better experience
My mom came to visit from California and she really wanted to eat in Little Italy
A friend suggested CASA BELLA
We were both pleased with the food, ambiance and service
My mom requested a table by the window so she could people watch and although the place was very crowded the hostess accommodated us by adding an extra table for 2
We started with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes and shared two entres
I had shrimp scampi and mom enjoyed the chicken milanese
Unfortunately we didn't save room for desert (they looked so good), but we did have cappuccino
It was a true Italian experience
Mom feels a little better knowing I have a good friendly place to eat here in the Big Apple
Made it a point to dine here whenever I was in town from North Carolina, because the food has always been very good
Unfortunately, the customer service has always been below average
Entertained a guest from Italy, here for the food show, on Wednesday, July 05
Decided to return on Sunday with more guests, to eat and enjoy World Cup finals
Made reservations
Upon arrival on Sunday, was refused entry and in fact had door closed in my face
Finally, after being allowed in to resolve missing reservation, was ignored, then literally screamed at, then summarily dismissed by the blonde hostess/owner? She was totally out of control
Witnessed her rude behavior to many patrons
This was a big day
I can clearly understand the crowd, the confusion and even the chaos that accompanied this World Cup event
What I will not accept is the conduct of the staff and its leader
Looking into her eyes, I could see the dollar signs that dictated her behavior
Well, the World Cup is over
But the memory of how we were treated will always remain
I will NEVER return to this restaurant; nor will I ever recommend it to anyone
I know that others feel this way as well
This was your opportunity to shine; to demonstrate how warm and gracious the Italian community can be
You failed miserably
Shame on you
And high praise to your neighbors who showed us true Italian hospitality
We had a wonderful time AFTER we left Casa Bella Restaurant
My friends and I made reservations for three for the day of the world cup
We had been there many times before and thought it would be a wonderful time
Love the food
Just an aside, we drove in from Jersey to be in little Italy for the festivities
Well, we got there and were treated like total ingrates
We were told that we did NOT have a reservation, so we tried to sit at the bar
We get to the bar and were told that the bar seats AT the bar were reserved, BUT we could sit in the 3 barstools in the corner
Then, in order to see the TV in the bar, we moved our chairs out about a foot to see the screen
Then comes the good part, the owner sees us and comes over and YELLS, You are NOT going to rearrange my restaurant
Either put those chairs back or get out
Needless to say, we will never set foot in that restaurant again
I will give my hard earned money to a buisness that will treat it's patrons like human beings
Comming from an authentic Italian family it's hard to please this picky person
Well Casa Bella blew me away the mozzarella and corrozza was the best I have ever had
The wait staff was very attentive and when I asked for more bread to dip in the lovely sauce it was brought with a smile
Can't wait till we can go back
==  we sat outside and ate like kins, Lobster and stuffed veal special and the food was divine and very lively street
Good catch !!
It all started when my boyfriend asked if he could have a marsala sauce on his pasta instead of marinara and was told flat out no
The calamari appetizer was completely tasteless, the portions were child sized, and the wine tasted like it came from a box
In addition the service was careless, we had to ask for water refills three times before they came
It was incredibly over priced, I would not reccomend this place to anyone, there are plenty of other restaurants in Little Italy to chose from , don't waste your money!!

the service is rude and mean
she wants you in and out of the restaurant as fast as possible, frowns upon college kids who apparently eat too slow and buy too little, don't respect that college kids are paying customers too ! i was asked if i wanted coffee when i walked in the door
i didn't know what i was going to order, so i said no
when i ended up ordering my meal, i got a combo meal and it came with coffee
when i later asked (nicely)if i could have coffee (not WHERE IS MY COFFEE?), the lady obnoxiously said you SAID you didn't want any !
needless to say, this was not my first bad experience with this lady
otherwise, decent food
decent prices
try the gyro
ok
first of all
there are NO hot waitresses or waiters
the service is rude, but very quick
the menu isnt so much delightful as just typical of a diner! their food is decent (a bit overpriced since remodeling last year) although i could make a better grilled cheese in the dorms
pretty damn good, after a night out at the bars, but oh-so-NOT romantic
oh and just to clarify: at toms a cheeseburger special means it comes with fries while the deluxe has lettuce and tomato on it
haha
now THATS fine dining
Tom's is just a step away from enlightenment
Tom's clean, friendly booths, beautiful waitresses and extensive, quintessentially-diner menu will leave you feeling as though you have reached the Shangri-La of diners, the diner to end all diners, the crowning achievement of New York Civilization
Also it is nearly always open
1
The sushi is alright
I did not like the Boston Tekka
2
Dumplings are very unusual
I've had Chinese dumplings for years but these are green and spinach flavored
3
Beef Stewed Noodle Soup is just nasty and greasy
4
if you order more than 10 bucks, you get a barbecue chicken stick
Late night munchies? Order from this all night spot
Try the chili-con-carne over rice or the strand burger
Symposium is a wonderful, down home Greek restaurant
It's been around for years--my parents used to hang out here when they were students at Columbia in the early 70s! The food is delicious, as is the sangria
Prices are very reasonable
Crowd tends to be students and professors and atmosphere is very casual
Symposium is the best that the Upper West Side has to offer
You will be pleasantly suprised to lose yourself in this authentic Greek find
The menu and the walls are a tribute to the art of Greece and its entree selections are a welcomed treat
Sangria at Symposium is a must and the tzatziki is out of this world
A hidden gem
Excellent Columbia campus restaurant
Great appetizers--get it all in the Symposium salad! Generous platters--Greek vegetables, potatoes, rice and Greek coffee to end the meal
Also, try a half pitcher of Greek sangria!
In Short A rustic design, with terra cotta tiles, exposed brick, high ceilings, an open grill kitchen up front and sponge-painted walls in yellow, orange and red
The atmosphere is characterized by loud conversation and indulgence--a hedonistic anticipation of the raw, sensual qualities of the cuisine
The groups of young customers are generally made up of neighborhood residents and Columbia grad students
Spanish speakers are scattered throughout both dining rooms
The empanadas come stuffed with creamed corn, celery and blue cheese
One of the best appetizers at Pampa is papa a la huancaina: boiled potatoes, chilled and sliced, covered in a spicy Peruvian mayonnaise and garnished with hard-cooked eggs
But all these appetizers are merely supporting players before the curtain rises for dishes "de la parrilla" (from the grill)
A superior choice is the skirt steak, cooked to a textbook medium rare
The steak was overcooked and the waiter was upset when i told to bring what i asked
I willl not return to a place where i was trated so bad Really bad
A group of six ate at Pampa and had a great time with great steak and sangria
Then when we ordered dessert the waiter ordered the wrong dish
He was surprisingly rude and refused to return the dessert and get what we asked for
Given our $350 bill I can't believe he would fuss over a $7 dessert
Well prepared food and worth it as long make the waiter repeat your order
The food is below average and they don't accept credit cards
I live in that block and the restaurant doesn't care about noises or fumes from the constant steak grillings
I don't recommend it
We held a party here
The food was excellent
The service was way below par
The waiters were surly--telling my guests that they could not have parmesan cheese for their pasta dishes and that they should be clearer when ordering in order to make their lives easier
The person ordering was from Argentina
Later, I, the bride, asked to have my filet mignon butterfly cut and was met with a cold stare and a refusal
It took some coercing to get the order in my way
The wait staff was brusque, rude, and acted rushed
They threw our plates down and bumped into people as they cleared them away
I was very disappointed and will never return
The worst part about all of this is that I believe the owner just doesnt care
Even the delicious beef cannot make me return again
It was just terrible
Went for dinner with my girlfriend last night and found this place very enjoyable
The service was ok, empanadas were tasty, skirt steak was very good and prices quite reasonable
Only drawback was that the room was uncomfortatbly warm prompting us to think they wanted patrons to believe they were actually down in South America
Despite this small issue, the overall experience proved this place was worth the trip !
If your looking for a spot where you can eat delicous food than this is a good choice
The skirt steak is outstanding and so is everything else
I highly recommend it
I went with my girlfirend to try what was advertised as an argentinian restaurant
Neither the food not the ambience has to do with anything argentinian, much less the waitress who were rushing us thorugh the evening
You can find better restaurants and save a lot of money in Queens
I came into Pampa with no expectations and left a very happy and stuffed man
The food is absolutely great and the service was spectacular
I never had Argentinean food in the past but the waiter recommended some of the best and tenderest steak I ever had
And the empanadas were so yummy as well
This place has won my heart over
Great Argentinian food, good service, outdoor garden in summer
none of the Argeninian restaurants in NY are equal to the best of Buenos Aires (nobody seems to be able to make good Provoleta!), but this one is close
wide variety of meats, huge portions, great uptown restaurant, one of the best on the upper upper west side
prices are reasonable
ambience is nice
quite odd that they only take cash, especially in this day age and also because if you have wine, dessert, etc you bill could easily top $100
they also had a minimum charge of $30 per person, which I found odd
but our waiter said it wasn't a problem if we spent under that amount
all in all a great little place with a big expansive menu, very good hidden spot on the upper west

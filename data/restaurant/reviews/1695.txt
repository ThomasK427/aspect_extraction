I was also impressed by the quality of food and wine, which surpassed that of more expensive French restaurants in New York
Our lamb was cooked to perfection, and I highly recommend the lemon souffle and green apple sorbet
There is a lovely ambiance to the place as well, though this might change when it is more crowded
Le tableau is just a good surprise
A simple storefront with an intersting menu and a comfortable ambiance is only the start
A resonable wine list, but you do not need it if you you order the tasting menu with wine pairing
I had the sweet pea Ravioli with Diver Scallops and Truffle cream and A venison Main course and My wife had the Mushroom Cigar and The salmon strudel, Every Bite was better than the previous one
It shows that they care
we will go again and again
I recently took my girlfriend there for Valentine's Day expecting a nice, cozy, romantic dinner, and got the worst service I think I have ever encountered
We were placed at a table near the bar, and had to wait on everything, and then had to ask the waiter for additional drinks, the next course, the complimentary champagne and rose, etc, etc
The service here is absolutely the worst
Not to mention the bill came to $165 for two people and only included a 2 course dinner
The food was good, but not much of a package deal, and horrendous service
Will not go back and absolutely do not recommend this place for a romantic dinner or date
We were seated almost 20 minutes late for our reservation but allowed to get our prix fixe order in a little late
My out-of-town guests marvelled at the $25 prix fixe bargain
The meal did get to NYC price levels once we ordered some wine, but the overall bargain can't be beat
The rack of lamb was perfectly seasoned and cooked; its potato side wasn't as impressive, though
The duck breast was flavorful, although still a tad overcooked; its coucous side was the perfect autumn accompaniment
The filet mignon was cooked exactly to specifications and the person who ordered it enjoyed it trememndously
As for desserts, the profiterole was stale and the cappucino a muddy mess, but their ice creams were magnificent all around
Our guests enjoyed the dimly lit, warm restaurant and would like to go back
It is a hit-or-miss place, in my opinion
This gem of a restaurant is tucked away between the narrow streets of the East Village, Alphabet city to be more exact
It is on Fifth Street between Avenues A B
I took my journey all the way from Upper East side to this forgotten side of the Manhattan over a recommendation of a friend
And was he right about this place
Menu is full of tasty choices
We decided to go with the Chef's Tasting Menu, wich I highly recommend, you can choose 4, 5 or 7 course meals
Meals are also not that small like those uptown french restaurants so if you order the 7 course menu, make sure you are starving
Each menu comes with optional wine matching, which I also recommend
Overall Great East Village Experience, Enjoy!
WONDERFUL PERFECT AND AMAZING
A LITTLE PRICEY BECAUSE OF THE WINE AND LOTS OF THINGS THAT WE WANTED WERE ADD ONS TO THE PRIX FIX
(FOR A SPECIAL APP THAT WE WANTED WE HAD TO TACK ON AN EXTRA $2 AND THEN AN EXTRA $3 FOR THE ENTREE) BUT THE FOOD IS TOP NOTCH AND THE SERVICE FRIENDLY
Enjoyed a wonderful birthday dinner with friends
This is exactly what I wanted: charming French restaurant with pleasant staff, creative menu, cool artwork and music
Romantic setting too, although the music should probably be lowered a bit
Wine list and reasonable and presented in a smart way
boy, this place rocks
who knew that you can actually have gourmet food for $40, including wine?! no wonder it's always packed to the gills except on the past memorial week-end when we happily, and quite by chance, stumbled on this gem
I can only recommend it
Take the best stadium dog, dirty water dog and even one from those guys out in Coney Island
Roll them together and still it doesn't come close to a Gray's Papaya
Order one any way you like and you'll understand the attraction and the loyalty!
You must make a stop at one of the Gray's Papaya's around the city during your stay
The dogs are cheap but that isn't what makes them the best! Great juices as well
If you go after 2am be ready to wait in quite a line
But don't let this stop you from waiting - it never takes long with those guys behind the counter
The menu: HOT DOGS, that's it, nothing else
But its the finest set of dogs I ever had, especially when complimented with either the Banna, Papaya, or Orange drinks
had been walking in LES in the scorching heat with my 16 mo daughter and decided to stop for a quick lunch in an a
c
spot
Not only was it absolutely comfy but the owner and the waitress went out of their way to make sure myself and my baby had the best spot to relax
I ordered sardines and artichoke salad
Delicious
Been awhile since i had such fine grilled sardines
Totally recommend this place
Can't wait to go back and experience more of their amazing selections
Great MENU!
After reading a review trashing this place, I had to write my first EVER
As a European who has eaten at countless of NY's self-proclaimed great French restaurants I highly recommend Lucien
Cozy, cramped, cluttered, service unpredictable, FOOD IS GREAT AND IT'S TRULY FRENCH
If you like NY's French brasseries (overpriced, overhyped) stay away
Lucien has the usual staples and some variations - good wine list (mix, decent wines, prices)
The reviews on here complaining about it are clearly written by people who came to NY from god knows where in small town America, have no clue what real French food is truly like and think great coffee is made in Starbucks
Go to Lucien for a great French bistro in NY and save yourself from the Americanized versions elsewhere over Manhattan - only tourists think any French restaurant charging more than $50/head in NY is actually worth the money!
I had a terrible time at this place
It took 75 minutes to get two french onion soups and a salad
No one even appologized for forgetting to put in our order
we were promised a round of drinks that never came
i refused to pay for my meal, first time i have EVER or would ever do such a thing
We stumbled upon this fabulous bistro last winter and stopped in for a glass of wine
Granted, it's small, but feels so authentically Parisian that it's worth it
Even though the LES is a trek for us, a friend and I went back to enjoy the steak frites and escargot
My roomies had my surprise birthday party here, and our party of 8 was only seated with a reservation made far in advance
But the pate, duck (oh, the duck!), rabbit and steak we enjoyed, as well as the wine and desserts, were fantastic, and reasonably priced
This is my favorite place in the city! Service is perfectly French--not too friendly, not too present, but always around when you need them
After reading several reviews, we took our chances with the place -- and found a true village gem! The decor is simple and the lighting is comfortable
It's not loud, and the service is quite friendly
I would definitely recommend the half confit, half magret duck
It looks great but tastes even better!
Seriously the best french restaurant in NYC, all around
I love everything they serve, and the wine list is excellent
Certain reviewers have grumbled about the cramped space and diners being nearly on top of each other while they eat
to them I say welcome to New York! That's the price you pay to eat the best food in the best city!
We wound up sandwiched between two tables of longtime fans who couldn't stop raving about it
When their food arrived, we salivated
When ours arrived we didn't speak to each other for 15 min
We couldn't
It was love at first tastebud
Highly recommended
I must say that I have never eaten better than I had in Paris
And this is the place that reminds me of those good times
It's not pretentious, the service is attentive, and the food is fantastic
I've even opted for the grilled chicken few times and have been very satisfied
A great French bistro when you're feeling a bit of a Parisian foodie
This charming French spot serves wonderful food and is a great spot for a cozy meal on weekdays

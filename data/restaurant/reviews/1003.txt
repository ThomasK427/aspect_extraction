I have 2 large problems with the place
First, none of the dishes I had were anything more than average at best, including the Serrano Ham, and some were below average
Secondly, and most obnoxiously, when I asked the bartender to recommend a glass of wine, he offered up what turned out to be $18 glasses!!! Multiplied by 5, you get the picture
That is a no-no in my book
Ever just want a few olives to enjoy your wine? If so, then this is not your place
Olives are extra
And each glass is poured at about 1/4 mark (easier to swirl?) so please sip
Nice looking space, but completely inefficient, especially in the winter when coats add a new dimmension of excitement to the vault-over-your-neighbor required to exit
Decent wines, just not well-conceived or valued
I was there on a Tuesday night right when it opened
5:00 and it was already packed
there are only 15 stools to begin with
A little annoying to have to go up to the counter to order the wine and food and then go back up again and wait to pay the bill
Food and wine for good but definitely a little too close for comfort
but worth a try
just go early and during th week
stopped in the other night, not knowing what this place was, and was so happy when I left! very tiny--had to stand for a bit, but it didn't matter
just had some wine and the manchego sampling that night, but i'll definitely be back
Fun, down to earth enviroment (although a bit on the noisy side)
Yummy omlettes, french toast, and pancakes plus good service
I live on 2nd street right next to this cafe
Bascially my Dad loves the turkey burgers and fish there
I'm not 5 years old okay I'm older than 10
I still go around with my dad
The food is okay, the staff is nice, I put up a little drawing of the coke sprite and orange soda bottles next to the kitchen, last table to the right, close to the aisle
A very unique place, very dark with candles special cakes, and toys for kids
I know the owner my friend from basketball's dad, his name is Ted gordon
overall this place is a different cafe, not a lounge, and a good place to take your kids
I had the turkey dinner and my friend had the meatloaf
The gravy was absolutely tasteless flour paste with a very strange consistency
The cranberry sauce was unrecognizable in taste
I only knew what it was by the color
The meatloaf reminded me of cardboard
The service was ok, but the food was so unbearable that we both ate less than half of our meals
I don't live in New York, only pass through about every three months
I always stay in Manhattan, but I almost always make a special trip out to the slope for weekend brunch at 2nd Street
I can't say much about the menu in general because I always order the absolutely delicious fruit-filled pancakes with fruit butter (which I've yet to find in another restaurant), real maple syrup and perfectly scrambled eggs
My inner child really enjoys the crayons and paper table cloths and my inner aesthete is genuinely impressed by some of the impressive artwork of past patrons that coats the walls
I've had more than one excellent date at this place, thanks in part to the rare combination of down-to-earth friendliness and real competence of the waitstaff
The wait can be a little long for brunch, but it's well worth it
We picked this place out of the air because we needed a reasonably priced place at the last minute on my son's birthday
I didn't know what to expect, but it was a wonderful night
Despite the quiet and elegant-ish ambiance, they were really friendly to us even with a 3 and 5 year old
The crayons and paper were cute and quaint, and they got my kids's dinners out before our appetizers
Thai chicken skewers were charcoal grilled and perfectly cooked
Meatloaf was seasoned well, and the mashed potatoes were excellent- sadly, a rare occurence, and something I always give high marks to
My son's moist and homemade red velvet cake had a crayon shaped candle, and all of the desserts tasted fresh, homemade, and were better retro creations than Magnolia
Lastly, the prix fixe was only $15
95
I couldn't help but rate it highly recommended on each count
This place used to be my hangout spot, until the prices increased dramatically for food that did not increase in quality
The food is fine for what it is, but should be better at these prices
There are plenty of better restaurants for the price, and none of the dishes really stick out, anyway
I go here every now and then when I want simple food that doesn't cost a fortune
If you don't expect too much, you won't be disappointed
The lunch prix-fixe is a great deal
The outdoor tables are nice, especially during the week
I've never had a bad experience here
The menu has most of what you'd expect to find at a neighborhood coffee shop, but the food is of much better quality (great pancakes, and fries)
They also have a great lunch menu, including a prix fixe that will fill you up and at a good value
If you don't mind a short wait, ask for a table outside on a nice day
Impressive service, too: On my last visit, the waitstaff was friendly and attentive, in spite being busy with the lunch crowd
Good music, and crayons, too; the walls and ceiling are papered with patrons' artwork
More unimaginative and tasteless cuisine I have ever experienced
I tried several dishes, while at dinner with friends, and was amazed to discover that even their Caesar Salad was completely lacking in flavor
Truly and remarkable bland
I went to lunch with 3 of my friends
The host was very curteous and helpful
THe waitress was very slow and did not inform us that there'd be a 30 minute wait for food even after we'd ordered
She never came by and when we asked a busboy what was taking so long he was very rude
THe host saved the day again by being respectful and keeping us informed as to what the delay ways and how much longer we should expect to wait
I'd been there before and had slow service but not to this extent
It's still worth going to if you have hourS to spare
This is a great place
Food and service are amazing
I have been there a handful of times and everyone in there treats me like a star when I walk in
It always comes out cheaper than expected
I highly reccomend this place
Recently I've tried:  Italian hummus: fresh, tasty Italian variation, with a spicy note; served with toasted bruschette; only $3
Spaghetti meatballs: large portion very savory; served with both Italian sausage (sweet) and meatballs (very nice)
Veal scallopine parmigiano: 3 tender filets in a lemon sauce
Great
Hamburger: Stands out; I hear it's one of their most popular items
Perhaps the best I've had in NYC; at $12 it cannot be beat
Order the fries crispy if you do not like non-crispy fries (they're good, though)
Diners next to me were jealous when the burger arrived
Ice cream, chocolate sauce, walnuts: Beautifully presented in a martini glass
Walnuts a bit stale -- a disappointment for a place with their act together in every other respect
Desserts are $7 apiece
Fruit plate was extremely generous, very juicy -- simple presentation on a carved pineapple boat
A fresh, luscious burger with gorgonzola cheese brought me back a second time
I now look forward to touring much more of the menu
Every indication is I will not be disappointed
Perfectly prepared meals, tasty, at excellent prices
Do yourself a favor and check it out
Decor is clean, sleek and elegant
Service is very good
Manager (Tony) is gracious, welcoming and friendly
the furnishing def looks like it came right out of an ikea catelog but the candles add a nice touch and the staff is very friendly and constantly there, my wine glass was empty only once and for less than a minute
food is ok, nothing amazing but i would go back for the ambiance

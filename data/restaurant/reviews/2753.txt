There was no excuse for the poor service nor the arrogance and disregard the owner expressed
After expressing our dissapointment to him, we were appauled at his arrogant and unreceptive attitude towards our dissatisfaction
Not once was an apology offered from anyone
We will never return and would encourage others to not waste their time at this sub-par establishment
I LOVE this restaurant
I have been to nearly every single one of Zagat's top-rated restaurants in every category, and you know what? I keep coming back to al di la
I have eaten here probably 30 times in the last two years, and have never had a dish that was even just ok - the food is simply sublime
The waitstaff knows their stuff (especially their wines), so if you are unsure about what to choose the first time, put yourself in their very capable hands
If I could only go to one restaurant for the rest of my life, I'd go to al di la every night, and die extremely happy
Now this place knows how to treat you
Sure, you have to wait - but if you know when to come, you'll be seated quickly and welcomed as if you were in Italy
The staff is extremely knowledgeable (ask them to help with the wine - yum) and the food - well - it's just fantastic
I was always proud to be a Sloper - this just adds to my pride
Al Di La serves up an impressive selection of options ranging from meditarranean fish to rabbit to to duck to pasta
I've been there numerous times and have tried a variety of their dishes, all of which have been nothing short of perfect! The only reservation is that they don't take reservations
I've been several times now and can only sing high praise
It's by far my favorite place in all of NYC
Yes, in Brooklyn, of all places! My husband and I split bagna cauda appetizer, beet ravioli, seafood stew, and pear cake
Everything was extraordinary, especially the bagne cauda and ravioli
And for a dessert-lovin' chick like me, it's rare that I liked the dessert least of all
This is what Italian food is meant to be
And go figure, in Brooklyn of all places
Blows away over-hyped over-priced schmucks like Mario Vatelli, who is supposedly cutting edge Italian/Meditteranean! Finally, we get beyond the goomba Italian-american food we've put up with since the 50's! I've been here several times and once I did have a problem with the owner's attitude, but that was when they just opened and he was understandably stuck-up; once I had a problem with a waiter trying to tell me what a proper machiatto was, but 2yrs later, he's still there and has learned a lot
All in all TOTALLY worth it
You WILL NOT find food like this ANYWHERE in NYC!!! The sardines are sublime
The treatment of ANY vegetable is incroyable
The pasta and risotto is perfect
Yum, I think I'll go there this weekend!
I love this place! I long for the mussel appetizer so I can dig to the bottom and savor the bread soaked in wine garlic broth
And the last time I went, I tasted a bit of heaven with their oxtail special! I hope they will put that on the menu so I can get that everytime I go! And for desert, I never pass the Giandiuotto -- the best chocolate ice cream I ever had! What a way to close a memorable dining experience!
Al Di La is the cornerstone of the Fifth Avenue transformation
While a bit crowded (and service can be a bit brusque on Saturdays) the food is always transportative affair
It's a Roman holiday on a plate
My partner loves the hangar steak while I am unwaveringly devoted to the pork saltimbocca
Look, even Wine Spectator loves this restaurant more than any other in all of Brooklyn
Great value!
Al Di La remains one of my favorite restaurants in New York
The food is always memorable, fairly inexpensive, and the atmosphere is cozy and comforting
The Mussels are always a great starter, and the juicy bread at the bottom of the dish, a treasure
The risottos are delicate and flavorful, and the swiss chard mulfatti with brown butter is enough to make your tastebuds absolutely melt
The main courses are always outstanding -- I'm a fan of the succulent rabit, and the desserts --yum!
The first time I stepped foot into this restaurant I was applying for a job
After working there for little over a year, I find myself drooling about three times a month for the malfatti, which are swiss chard and riccotto cheese balls of delight served with sage brown butter
The beet ravioli is a staple as well
I am almost certain I have tried everything on the menu and although the menu does change, I return for the salt-n-bocca, which is done with pounded pork, prosciutto, and sage leaves
this is served with fresh pork jus and pan crushed seared potatoes
Another favorite is the hanger steak which is always cooked to perfection and served with a generous amount of arugula and a balsamic vinegar reduction served as a sauce
The simplicity of the food is why I return, not to mention the amazing olive oil they import
a gem of an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn's park slope
The owner is serious about the food and would not even play music for fear of distracting his customers from enjoying what is placed in front of them
it also has a great italian wine list and decent service
The wait could be long because of the limited number of seats but it is worth it, especially if you leave your cell phone # with them and go off for a drink at any one fo the excellent bars nearby, like lokie, great lake, etc
For Italian cooking this good there is no reason not to go
Give them your cell phone and wait in a nearby bar
They'll call you when your table is ready - is that so hard? Highlights - Whole fish baked in sea salt, hanger steak, all of the past
Cozy, happy atmosphere
Worth it
The only trouble with Al Di La is getting in -- if you're not there at 5:45 or so to line up in advance of the 6:00 opening, don't count on getting a place
Once you do get in, however, it's easy to see why even Brooklynites are willing to stand on line (I mean, why do we live in Brooklyn if not to avoid lines)
The food is uniformly excellent, graciously served and surprisingly reasonable
And, despite the crowd clamoring to get in, eating in the cozy corner trattoria is a relaxed, rewarding experience on every level
great burritos
cute, casual setting
quick delivery
better than uncle moe's on 7th
I get food from these guys every couple of weeks
At other places I often find souvlaki burned and falafel hard and dry but they make it just right
The houmous delisious! If they would it in big tubs I'd keep it in the fridge all the time
Also the lemondae is delicious
I've been going to this place for over ten years - although the ambience is just ok the food is superb
For the first time in a long time I ate a falafel sandwich where I tasted falafel in every bite, and the falafel I tasted was damn good
If you eat in you have total control over hot sauce and tahini as a squeeze bottle of each is brought out with your sandwich
I have to agree with the previous review that the atmosphere isn't much, but Mister Falafel can't be beat for quick, delicious, cheap takeout
The line gets a bit claustrophobic, since you're jammed against the counter, but the enormous Greek salad (replete with herbed feta, slightly sweet dolmades and a plethora of olives), the baba ghanouj and the eponymous falafel are great, as are the spanokopita and other spur-of-the-moment pastries they always seem to be featuring
Good for meat-lovers, too, of course
Tofu on 7th is distinctive in cooking Chinese food in a healthy way
They avoid using large amounts of oil, salt, and MSG
The flavors that come through are the natural flavors of the primary ingredients
Some people are not used to this, so the food tastes bland to them
It is true, they do not use a great many spices, but I find their food delightful nonetheless
It's true, there's no good chinese in the Slope, but there are definitely better places then Tofu (Try Mr
Wonton, it's not a masterpiece, but is consistent and safe
) We came in on a cold day for big bowls of noodle soup
What we got was flavorless, watery broth with a bit of noodles and meat
The steamed dumplings had an off smell and were too large and barley seasoned
If you want Chinese, you are minutes away from both Brooklyn's and Manhattan's Chinatowns
Park Slope really needs a decent Chinese restaurant
This isn't it
The only good thing is that their menu is healthy-oriented but you soon feel that was to make up for the quality
If you have a little time and want really good chinese, take the N to Brooklyn's Chinatown (Sunset Park)
Tofu on 7th is far better than your average takeout Chinese joint -- especially in the Slope, where it's not hard to get bad, bad takeout
The ingredients are fresh, the food's prepared with some care and precision, there's a wide variety of healthy dishes, and the service is solicitous (sometimes too much so)
Definitely one of the Slope's best bets for Chinese food -- or for vegetarians (there's an extensive veggy menu, as well as many meat dishes)
This place has the best pizza in the south slope
The rest of the food is mediocre at best, but the pizza is good honest brooklyn pie
What I love most about Food Chow is their dumplings
Oh, they're so good
Their other entrees are not oily like most chinese take-out and the steamed veggies are freshly cooked al dente
Also try the seasome chicken
Heavenly!

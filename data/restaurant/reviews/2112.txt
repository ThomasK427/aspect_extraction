I can't believe this place is still in business
After waiting for 40 mins for our meal, the food came out cold, surprising as we were 1 of 3 in the restaurant
We asked our server if we could get the food warmed up and he had to consult with another waiter to see if it was even possible! Slow service
terrible Indian food
save you $$ and go the numerous other Indian restaurants in the village
Needless to say, we will not be returning to this one
Growing up I ate a lot of homemade Indian food and Baluchi's didn't really cut it for me
I went with a large group from my school and the staff accomodated for us well
The service was great and the staff was polite, punctual, and well versed on the food
The ambiance is also nice and quite pretty
However, the indian food was less authentic than I expected and was definitely slightly Americanized, at least for my table
The samosas and chicken kabobs were great tho, spicy but not too much, and seasoned well
I did enjoy the palak paneer- one of my favorite dishes, a spinach and cheese puree
The chole and tandoori chicken were passable
The naan was decent, and the korma rather soggy
Its definitely good to try, especially if you've never had indian before, but try bukhara grill if you want the reall stuff
We went late on a Saturday night after two rather large martinis in the Village, and Baluchi's provided just what we needed
Reliable, quick Indian food, with good service at a reasonable price
The Combination appetiser was terrific, the Chicken Tikka Masala, just what you'd expect
We were a little disappointed with the Lamb in Spinach: not enough spice to make it individual; and the keema naan carried too much oil to be a winner
But definitely a reliable choice overall
Being from the UK, where curry is an institution I'm often disapointed by the quality on offer in NYC
However, I thought the food here was great - full of flavour, well spiced and very well presented - the sagwalla in particular is excellent
oh, and there was certainly plenty of it - I often suspect people who put portions weren't as large as hoped or simliar are probably being saved from themselves
Would certainly visit again and also recommend to friends
The food here is certainly good; however, better Indian food does exist in New York City
I was not particularly impressed with much about this place, though the service was reasonably good
The portions were smaller than I was expecting, and I actually left the restaurant still feeling hungry
There are many good Indian restaurants in this area, and also in different areas of the city, so this place does not really stand out enough to merit a return visit
kitzy indian decor in a comfortable atmosphere
The food was fantastic with excellent vindaloo and rogan josh
The saag was also up to par
Top it off with the lunch special and its an incomparable value
The samosas are crispy, the saag panir is amazing and the poori large and puffy
To top it all off, the the decor is really interesting
Try to sit on the low bench in the front window
The Scene A classic tavern: During the day, delivery people on lunch break share space at the bar with smartly dressed neighborhood professionals
To avoid an overcrowded back room packed with baseball hat-wearing Village rovers, come early, while the sun is still streaming through the dusty windows
The Food Besides cold beer and a full bar, the Bistro keeps its options simple
The burger--small, juicy and incredibly messy--is the best in the neighborhood and certainly among the very best in the city
Other options on the spartan menu include chili, a BLT and a wonderfully marinated, jaw-stretching grilled chicken sandwich
Fries are always crisp and tasty
This is the place for it
Any seasoned New Yorker will tell you some of the best things in life are simple
This place serves beer and burgers and does it well
If you want a smile, go to a BR Guest restaurant, that's what they're trained to do
If you want a great burger, go to Corner Bistro!!
Great hamburgers, but the Corner Bistro has the worst service of any food establishment I've ever been to
Even a Muscovite would shake thir head at the service
In a word, it's non-existent
Don't go to Corner Bistro expecting to be seated right away and to have a charming, cute waitress serve your food
This place is what it is: old school, brisk, small, busy, no frills
It just happens to serve the best burgers in the city
Great place if you can avoid stopping by when Jeff, one of the bartenders, is working
He must be a relative of the owner to remain employed with such a consistently rude attitude towards customers
Huge contrast to the rest of the friendly staff
Other than that, it's a fabulous neighborhood institution that hasn't changed in years and hopefully never will
These are the thickest burger patties found in town and tastes awesome
Meal for two under twenty bucks including beer - can't beat that! There's a reason why there's a long line - cause it's worth the wait
Definitely hit Corner Bistro if you haven't! It is such a great spot, just a bit busy at times
But if you don't mind drinking a beer while you wait in line, this is your place! And the prices are so low, it's great!
It had been 8 years since I set foot in The Corner Bistro
The place was the same
Thank the universe for keeping it the same
I had traveled 8000 miles to get a burger and of course this was the place to take care of that need
The music was still excellent and it still felt like a home away from home
Many things change and good things turn to dust but the Bistro is a constant in burger heaven among a minefield of imitators

Okay, so I was introduced to Corner Bistro or as we like to call it The CB about a month ago
Let me tell you I am not a big hamburger fan, but one bite of this hamburger and I was hooked
This by far is the best hamburger I have ever eaten in my life
If you do one thing before you die you better eat this hamburger
CB is always there for you day or night
stumbling home at 2 am where else can you go but CB to satisfy that late night hunger ping
oh yeah you can go anywhere, but you won't be satisfied
I love this place: cheap beer and great burgers! I know that you have to wait but it is worth it!
I was told this is the best burger joint in NY
My friend and I cued for 1 hour before being seated by the rude little man who was our server
he didn't offer any smiles, thankyous, please, you're welcomes
hardly looked us in the eye once
Our burgers arrived, and they were disappointing
I could easily make better myself at home, and the fries were greasy
I would not recommend it at all
i love burgers and corner bistro is definitely my favorite place in the city! you must get the bistro burger medium rare
the fries are just ok but the burgers are big you don't even need fries
$2 beers cant be beat! i would eat here everynight if i could!!!!
I love this place
It's a bit overcrowded, and sometimes you have to wait quite long to be seated (especially if you are with a lot of friends), but the food is an incredible value for money
The hamburger is amazing! very tasty! and the fries excellent
This is for sure my favorite burger in NY
service is not special
It's what you get at a packed bar
Go in off hours!
I agree with the previous poster that said that the late night bartender is beyond surly
he's a maniac! We stopped in Saturday last weekend and he threw two guys out who clained about how long there burgers were just as the server was setting the burgers down in front of them! But please, he fits in at that hole in the wall bar like a glove
Dingy, no atmosphere, dark, zero personality on the staff
and the best burgers around bar none!! Laugh off the bartender's attitude and enjoy your stay, it's well worth it!
If you're out drinking and you're looking for a delicious and filling snack for cheap and beer to wash it down with, then Corner Bistro is the place for you
I've been going up and down the best burgers in nyc lists for months now and Corner Bistro is definitely top 5
The burger was huge and juicy

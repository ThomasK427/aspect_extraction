The meatloaf served to me was in the shape of a small, round meatball
When I cut through the meatball I noticed that the meat had not been fully cooked
Red, stringy meat dominated the center of the meat
No free refills on soda
Each glass costs $3

This historic restaurant is lovely and comfortable
The menu isn't big, but anyone could find something they'll like
I've been there 3 times and really enjoyed each meal
But be warned --- the service is slow
So if you have to be out in under an hour, eat elswhere
Excellent food accompanied by friendly, knowledgeable staff
The ambiance was perfect for my business lunch and also a great place to entertain friends and loved ones
Not to mention the building is rich with american history, as it also houses a museum
I'd recommend this restaurant to everyone I know

This is the place you've searched for your entire bar hopping life
This place has come a long way from the old smoke filled ginmil it used to be
The staff is the best on the downtown scene and the food is cheap, but delicious! It is something you just have to try to understand
Stop by for the hot steam table between 12-2pm
After 2pm they revert to regular bar food menu
Ask for Pat and your first of many trips to this place will have begun
If your downtown and looking for a relaxed drink or a place to take your friends you should try this one
Really good delivery food
I have only had the chinese food, but I would assume the japanese food is decent too
The moo shu is the best in the business
Soups, noodle, and vegetable dishes are great as well
Also very cheap and fast
Convenience is the best thing going for this restaurant
There are not many in the Wall St
area, although I am hoping that Cipriani's will open for lunch
The food is overpriced relative to the quality, but the service and ambience are nice for business meetings
I am sure they would improve with a bit more competition
The food is nothing to write home about - i had the alaskan salmon price at $26 and it was bland and didn't taste very fresh
I also had a salad priced at $12 that was ok
Overall it's like a glorified cafeteria overly priced and nothing nocks your socks off
For the price you pay you would think it would be a little better or at least would stand out but instead it's bland tasteless food - even the veggies had no taste
Stayed in the adjoining Club Quarters Hotel and enjoyed a Friday evening dinner at Bull Run on a cold, rainy night
The wine list was nicely varied and we selected glasses of zinfandel and cabernet, which pleased both of us
The salads were among the best we've ever had, both the mixed baby greens and the warm duck confit
Our entrees were a strip steak, medium rare and cooked to perfection
The meat was perfectly flavored, the outside charred to just the right degree, the inside warm and pink to red
The sauteed sea bass, in a Thai curry with shrimp and dumplings over a mushroom puree was exquisite
We were both very pleased with our meal and have recommended the Bull Run to our friends and family
If you don't mind a sparse crowd, the perfect spot for a quality dinner
No waiting, great food, solid service and a lot more quiet than lunch time
Highly recommended!
Don't know about the rest of the food, but the burgers are one of New York's hidden treats
I eat here about once a month and you can always depend on a nice selection of quality dishes and congenial service
THIS PLACE IS OFF THE HOOK! The Carving board is Off the chain!  The assorted Salads are also good
This is the real thing
Great pizza by the slice
Nice guys run the place and the prices are good
Oh, they have good breakfast sandwiches too
The only thing I find strange is that they have a back room that is a bar
It's filled with construction guys and ladies of the evening
I think they drink there cheaply and then go next door to the strip club
In Short The restaurant is a colorful spot filled with folk art and island motifs, pastel-painted columns, blond wood floors, yellow walls and alabaster light fixtures hanging from knotted ropes
The menu is billed as "Euro-Asian," which implies an eclectic melding of Japanese, Chinese, Thai and French cuisines, employed with a classical but light technique
Dishes include macadamia nut mahi mahi, blackened ahi tuna with soy mustard butter, and Szechuan spiced baby back ribs
Although I had read the superb reviews on this site, my friends and I were all disappointed
When we ordered the wine, they brought us the wrong vintage
After telling our waiter, he brought the manager, who did nothing to fix the situation
He did not offer to bring us the right bottle and just left
This refusal to deal do the right thing is not acceptable for a restaurant like Roy's
Then there was yellow sediment on the bottom of our white wine
The sommelier said it was normal but offered to bring us another glass if it bothered us
One of my friends wanted a different glass, but she never brought her anything
The service was manipulative and snotty in their pretense of being friendly, but they are not really interested in making you happy
Though the food and ambience is good, you can do better elsewhere
This is one of the very very rare places (and itself a truely hidden gem in the city) that that is both elegant and family friendly
We went for dinner and was greeted by Roy himself
Instead of picking from the regular menu, we opted for the tasting menu where every single course is just SUPREME (and I don't use this word often after years of dining on corporate expense account)
A big surprise: We choose the wine option as well from the tasting menu but none of us drank much
So in the end, the waitress gave us a considerable discount towards the final tab
How often do you see this among Zagat's most highly-rated restaurants???  I read some of the previous not-so-positive reviews in this column and I wonder why
I've been here twice and loved both experiences
The first time was for my boyfriend's birthday
The staff had our table decorated with ribbons and candles, and had selected a table away from all the traffic, it was a nice setting for us
The second time, we had a large group of friends meeting up with a few from out-of-town
The service was mostly attentive, although our server seemed to get a bit impatient trying to push us to order the Souffle dessert at the same time that we're ordering the entrees
The food was fresh, but I was more impressed by the artistic arrangement of food and overall presentation
I wasn't so hurt by the bill afterwards thinking of the good times that we had there
We ate at Roy's predominantly because it was located in our hotel
We had just come off the plane and were exhausted
The meal completely changed our outlook
We ordered the tasting menu and were definitely not disappointed! Everything was yummy and the portions were just right
(unless you require huge amounts of food to feel satisfied) Being accustomed to eating a lot of Asian food as well as seafood it was a refreshing change from what we are encountering elsewhere in Manhattan
this place isn't frequented as often as it should be by those living across the street at BPC-- and that's too bad! Roy's should promote itself to the residents across the street (I don't live downtown, but i have introduced Roy's to my friends living there, who were surprised that a decent restaurant exists so close!!)
The food is fairly good, the only caveat is that the oysters were gross (eat the cooked foods, stay away from the raw stuff?)
During the winter I had a lobster risotto that was AMAZING
this summer's menu isn't as fun, but it's still definitely tasty
Give it a try
They started a new sake list
yay!
The menu changes, and for a non-fish or pork eater - sometimes the choices are few and far between
If you like both of these though, you will always have plenty of options

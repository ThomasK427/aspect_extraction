The amount of wine on the walls is amazing
Very dim and romantic setting
great pastas! It's been around for awhile so not a real hot spot but still a pretty good crowd
The service however, has never been a strong point
It is reasonably priced though, but I wish they would do something about the snotty spaced-out waitresses
its an nyc staple, so u have to go
the food is great, and its a good scene at night when they clear the tables off the floor and people come to dance n drink
This restaurant is a fun, trendy place to eat w/friends
The bread they bring you in the beginning is delicious, and I would recommend the Penne A La Vodka - my favorite! Definitely a fun place to hang out w/friends and either eat or have a drink!
I go there all the time because we live nearby and I have never been disappointed
The wait staff was always very friendly and although the food is not amazing, it is great food for the price
I really enjoy the spicy noodle dish
YUM!
I live in Philadelphia
I LOVE this place so much that I have actually driven to NYC from Philly JUST to go to Thai Village
If that doesn't say how I feel, I don't know what else does!
one of the best thai food restaurants in the city
have been a regular there for last 6 yrs
all the chicken curries are heavenly-the meat tender and juicy, and the sauce infused with spices and just the right viscosity
the pad thai, also, is excellent
i have no idea what the previous reviewer ate and/or if she just wasn't in good mood that day
in all: a treat for all thai food lovers
oh, and cheap too
I ate there yesterday
The papaya salad was not fresh---it had been cut up the day before (maybe two) and severed with extra spices to cover the taste
And I had the worst pad thai in New York
However, the other two dishes very good
Overall the service was poor and the food spotty
I would avoid this restautant
This restaurant was easily accesible
The food was fantastic and the service was on time! It is a cute place to bring for family or friends
Just FYI, they got their liquor license back a little while ago
I echo all of the comments posted here, great deal for the price
This WAS one of my favorite places to go
You can't beat the $3 margaritas
They seem to have lost their liquor license (they haven't had it since early March)
Haven't been back since, and wouldn't recommend it unless / until they get it back
Harry's is just OK
I have eaten here over 20 times, since it's close by, easy, and simple
and I'm lazy:) Yet every time, I search desperately for an item on their menu that might have some excitement to it
Nothing under $12 really has any flavor or punch
let alone any semblance of being Mexican
This is not Mexican
it's not Tex-Mex
It's just boring
Is that what SanFranMexo is all about??
Who can complain? Burritos = fine
Chips = fine and unlimited and free
AND 2 happy hours = one from 5 - 8 and the other after 10pm
Margaritas for $3
Beers $2
WOAW!
The dude who thinks this place belongs in a mall obviously thinks he's the Burrito King
whatever
This place is small, cozy, and has great food for its price range
Sure, go ahead and spend $20 on a burrito elsewhere and sure you'll get a better burrito
but then you're the fool for spending $20 on a burrito! Harry's also has an excellent deal during happy hour, 5-8pm -- $2 for most beers, and unlimited salsa and chips for free!
Harry's full title is Harry's San Francisco Style Burritos
For those from the west coast, they will quickly discern that no such item exists
San Francisco is not known for its burrito's nor should Harry's be
The steak used in the burrito's are grilled improperly and the quality is quite poor
Many of the other items were simply not authentic and lacked any flavor (I tried several items over a 4 week period)
Harry's is cheap however and you can get away with an entree and a beer for less than $10
If that is what you are looking for then that is what you will get
If you want quality Mexican food, I suggest you look somewhere else
Harry's is a great place to grab a quick lunch
the staff is friendly and attentive then and I enjoy grading papers here (I work at NYU)
Dinner can get busy and sometimes seems under-staffed
It's fun to share the fajita platter, though
seriously, harry's has some great food
that means a lot coming from me, the most pickiest-lactose-intolerant-vegetarian
and those margaritas are great
yeah the waitstaff isn't too bright but the prices and quality of food definitely make up for it
If you catch Harrys' during Happy Hour you will have delicious huge portions of reasonably priced food and pitchers of strong addictive margaritas!
While the service was fairly good, thats about all that was fairly good about Harry's
The food was not that tasty and their sangria was not that great
There were one too many flies buzzing around and overall its not a place I'd go to again
Try Cafe El Portal, its ten times better
I went here on a date on a Friday night
We sat outside and it was very romantic
The food here was tasty and huge portions! It is definately a good place to go if you're thinking of relaxing awhile with your food, good company and a bottle of wine!
This is the so far from fresh itialian it's not even funny
Everything tasted a couple days old
The salad was soggy, the bread was hard, the pasta dishes were cold and poorly made
The sauces were from a huge bin for sure
Service was bad and our orders were wrong when they came out and still made us pay for the wrong one
If you are itilian, you will be the only one in the joint
Deeeeeeepressing
The food here is nothing spectacular, but it is a good value for the price
The price and the food keeps me going back, but only go if you have 2-3 hours to spare
the service is incredibly slow
The food was medicore: The pre-dinner bread was no better than plain, Wonder bread; the shrimp scampi was too salty and buttery, and the grilled salmon was a bit dry
My companion ordered a meal that was supposed to come with asparagus
They gave her brocolli; and made no apologies for the switch
The waitress was completely unattentive: she was unfamiliar with the menu, she did not tell us her name, did not ask how our meal was going, and left the restaurant - back pack and all - before we had even paid
Needless to say, we did not leave a tip!
The food is great and very inexpensive
The ambiance is very enjoyable, and everytime I go here the service is superb; props to Milton the General Manager!!! I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone who is looking for great Italian food at an affordable price
One of my favorites; a perfect 10!
Worst experience ever

Expensive, but the BEST service and the BEST food
Better investment than stocks
Great culinary experience! Excellent service, ambience and food
Seating a bit close to one another, but it is so romantic that you forget others are around you and just get entranced into the food and company (especially after some red wine)! Took my husband here for his birthday
For the past four years, I've gone to March for my anniversary and have yet to be dissapointed
While the meal does run about $300-350 including everything, it is well worth it - great food matched with equally wonderful drinks, amazing service, and romantic ambiance
The food is excellent here
Service is very good
Some of the table are a bit of a squeeze and the portions are small
We spend over $300 (excluding wine) and was still hungry
You don't have to ring up a $374 tab like we did, but we weren't sorry we did
Great wine aside, go for the lobster/truffle beggars purse, sashimi, poached lobster, foie gras, and venison
Service staff very helpful
The best meal I've had this side of the Atlantic
Food is delicious and innovative
I like that you create your own menu from a list of dishes
You can have any three on the list, plus dessert for $74
Ask the sommelier to pair each dish perfectly with wine and it totals $112
A great value as well as a great dining experience!
To this date I have never had a better meal in New York City, and I have eaten at all the top ranked restaurants
The service is exquisite, with the exception of an overbearing sommelier
To his credit, he certainly knows what he is doing
The food is phenomenal and worth each and every penny
I recommend going with the wine pairings with one of the larger tasting menu choices
The setting is quite romantic; especially the outdoor back terrace area
Unlike a lot of the other top restaurants you will actually have the ability to walk out full, so save up your money and appetite and enjoy
PS
dont forget to bring a jacket, they are required
if it is anything like March, let me go now
Went with my boyfriend for our birthday
Upon being seated I was given a bouqet of roses (when you make the reservation they ask if it is for a special occasion)
Our Captain was very attentive and knowledgeable about everything we were eating and drinking
I highly recommend the tasting menu, portions are petite but there are enough of them to truly satisfy
The food and the wine are out of this world
So is the bill but it was well worth every cent!
went to MARCH for the first time [8/7/02] to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday
first impressions were fantastic for both of us! a warm greeting,prompt seating [even though we were 1/2 hour early] at a choice table, and a birthday bouquet of perfumed roses hailed our arrival
the rooms were warm,very comfortable and fashionably decorated
service was silky and seamless [second only to le bernardin]

lobster and sashimi melted in your mouth as multi-layered explosions of superfresh harmonized flavors bombarded your senses
you could taste the sea in the seafood dishes, the earth and sun in vegetables, and heartiness and tenderness in the meat courses
then came dessert! alas,the supersonic gustatory plane was shot down to earth
pineapple with brown sugar had no magic
baked alaska tasted as if it came out of a box
however, except for the unhappy ending, MARCH was an experience worth revisiting over and over
Went to March for a first anniversary celebration and had the perfect evening
Bollinger champagne as a house pour is the perfect start
The food is imaginative, with a mix of subtle and powerful flavors flowing together
The lobster carpaccio and the venison stand out
Flawless service and more than fair prices on some great wines
I really enjoyed the food here
The shrimp Pad Thai was excellent with a very large portion- (I could not finish it all)
The wait staff was very pleasant and service was overall very good
It is a large restaurant, with a very large bar
There is a lot of action at the bar
It seems to be a lot of the after work crowd
Overall it was a nice relaxed experience
The prices are reasonable for midtown
Looks like a great place to hold a party
This is definitely NOT the restaurant to go for anything close to Thai food
The appetizers resembled a vague relation to something Asian, but were greasy and bland
We ordered the skewered chicken with peanut sauce and it was the runniest, most flavourless peanut sauce I'd ever tasted
The only Thai-like meal on Main menu was Pad Thai
For the most part, the menu was nouveu American
Fish featured heavily, which is what the majority of our table ordered
Each dish looked exactly the same -fish on a bed of spinach with a thin tasteless sauce
Because the place was a microbrewery, we all ordered beer, the first beer on the menu wasn't available, and the beer we got barely cooled the glass
For two days our group lamented on spending almost $50 a head (20% mandatory gratuity for tables of 6 or more) for food that was barely palatable
Save your $$ and go somewhere else
The food is only so-so, it is very expensive and the service is horrible
I asked the waiter to make me a vegetable plate as no vegetarian dish was offered but several veggie side dishes were
At first he flat out refused and said I had to order pad thai with no meat
Then said he would ask the chef but only returned to serve me pad thai
And while the pad thai was tasty they have some nerve charging $17 a serving at lunch!! The waiter was rude to my friend when she asked for a small plate to share an appetizer
I won't be going back
I went here to meet up with some friends after work
While the atmosphere might be good and beer tasty, the service makes the whole experience not worth having
The food was alright but not worth the attitude that came along with it
Very affordable and accomodating - irony is that the brewery is really only one part of the experience - it's a top-notch restaurant with multiple-choice prix fixe to boot
Highly recommended for everything from business dinner to romantic dinner to large groups
The Scene For more than four decades, the Four Seasons has been synonymous with the power lunch, where high rollers break bread and, by meal and deal's end, more than the sirloin has been devoured
Choose from two very different settings: the legendary Grill Room, with its soaring ceiling, rosewood walls, leather banquettes and rippling curtains made of brass beads
Or the romantic Pool Room featuring a gurgling marble pool framed by illuminated trees
Service is polished and exacting
The Food Stick with specialties like lusty civet of wild boar with pappardelle, lentil and sausage soup and the simple roast turbot with root vegetables
Entrees include grilled tuna in a pomegranate sauce, steaks, bison, and pheasant breast
Desserts rise to the occasion
took my parents there to celebrate their anniversary
i've been to all the major restaurants in town and they left me a little flat
4 seasons had an exceptional decor with decent appetizers and deserts
the entres however were absolutely amazing and the tea was the best i ever had
the service was delightful and there were even a few celebrities sitting at the next table
the only con is its expensive but if you want to go someplace special with somone special, i can see it being worth it
This is a perfect place for couples
We had great food, wine, and service
The inside is cozy for winter dining too
I highly recommend this restaurant
The service was surely to say the best
the pool was bubbly with whitish gray foam

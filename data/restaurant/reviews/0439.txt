Drinks are great too! Just writing about the food is making my mouth water
It was an amazing discovery, on a wet night walking through the west village;my friends and I were hungry and thirsty and decided to give it a try, even thou we are not familiar with Jamaican food
long story short, the experience was incredible, the food, service, ambiance
the mojitos
WOW!!!! Everybody in the restaurant made our evening
one to remember!!!! we are going back for sure!!! If u go
try the seafood creole
WOW
Threw a surprise birthday party here
Had reservations for 13
They refused to seat the party of 11 because 2 ppl were missing
I told them that if seated we could order for the 2 people as to not hold things up but they refused
Waited over an hour after the 2 people arrived to be seated because according to them we lost our reservation b/c 2 people were late
Its extremely unrealistic that groups, especially a group of 13 will be there all at once especially w/ the bad parking
Plus they sat us downstairs while waiting b/c we were so large and even though none of us had to check coats-the guy refused to let the last 2 people in our group join us unless they checked theirs-it wasn't expensive- its more about the principle
I used to like Negril but I refuse to spend another penny there
Negril Village provided the perfect ambience to close a week of events my company was involved in
The hospitality their staff extended towards our party (of over nearly 100 poeple), even going out of the way to fix two vegan plates for a couple of guests, was extraordinary
We all throughly enjoyed (and continued to talk about) the quality of the meals, the drinks, and the fun everyone had on the dance floor downstairs
I personally love Negril
I have been there about 3 times and I plan on celebrating my birthday there again this year
It is a very nice spot
The atmosphere is great and its good for large parties or one-on-one dates
The food is a little overpriced, but everytime I have gone, its been worth it
The drinks are strong, the service is pretty good and i recommend this place to anyone who wants an adult crowd, good music (althought a tad loud at times
) and excellent food
Host and waiters are great
In spite of a very lively and busy crowd, this staff has a good handle on the place, ushering people promptly, never letting an ounce of attention slip
Very hard job, but they do it with great aplomb
Their service contributes that much more to the excellent food and dessert and cocktails! Night and day difference from the 23rd street and 8th avenue Negril with the rudest, snappiest and condescending little hostess who talks down to waiters and colleague host AND customers
Nothing went better with our mango martini and jerked salmon than the sepia hues of this ultra hip restuarant
Negril is a great dinner spot before heading to the Blue Note or checking out a movie at IFC
The service was nice and the crowd excellent
No plans after dinner at Negril? Check out Rum Lounge, the atttached lounge one level below
It showcases the best dancehall and reggae
The service at Negril Village sucked we made a birthday party reservation for 15 and waited 2 hours and still didnt get seated
We ended up leaving and spending our money else where
The service is not work the prices on the menu
The hostess insisted that we will be seated in a few minutes when asked
A few minutes ended up being 2 hours
Not recommended for parties or groups
Dont count on them to seat you if you make reservations, learn from my mistake
Me and couple of girlfriends went there first to start out a night of celebration
When we got there the ambience were beautiful
The hostess was not the friendliest, but she wasn't rude either
The waiter was very gracious and waiters that we waiting on other tables would make sure we were satisfied when just walking past our table
I can't say enough about the food
From the drinks to the desert it was very delicious
For a party of 4 which included a caraf of sangria, one additional drink, 4 entrees and 4 desserts and the added on gratuity, it came to a total of $169 which was not bad at all
We will definetly be returning very soon
P
S
The light reggae music and the lounge added on a nice touch
THE STAFF IS WONDERFUL, VERY FRIENDLY AND ACCOMODATING
The live band was great
The down side is the band needed to turn the volume down just a bit
My friend and I spent the entire time saying hugh? to each other
The food wasn't so spectacular either
We ordered coconut shrimp (over cooked) and the sampler for 2 that had cod fritters (EXCELLENT), the vegetable patties (not very tasty) and calamari (which was cold and greasy) and sweet plaintains
the mini cup of guacamole (the Guacamole was INCREDIBLE but the portion was to small)
If you like a strong drink, this is the place to go (I am not a drinker but did have a sip of my friends cocktail) I think I may have grown hair on my chest (that's how potent it was) which wouldn't be a bad thing if I were not a woman :)
We had a 7:00 reservation for a party of 9; 2 people were running slightly late
We were told by the hostess they won't add 2 chairs when the last 2 arrived
It is now only 7:05
When we were seated, our table only had 6 chairs half the silverware was missing
When our last guest arrived, the waiter said to hurry up and pick what you want to eat
How Rude!!! Plus, the waiter said out loud to another staff member oh no, another person, where is she going to sit? We HAD a reservation for 9 , we weren't ADDING people to our reservation
We spent nearly $300 including 20% AUTOMATIC gratuity
We felt so uncomfortable, we ate our meals quickly and didn't even order dessert
Negril Village has been my absolute worst dining experience
went to a friends birthday party and was not impressed with this place at all
We waited few hrs for our food, minf you the place was empty
There was VERY VERY loud live music
The drinks were water down and the only BIG thing was the bill
The services was not all that and they seemed to be bother when asked for anything needed
HELLO!! Why don't I have a straw on my cup of soda???? wouldn't go back
I walked past waiter with a friend, waiter stated very loudly and angrily She's bringing another person, where is she going to sit
Rude and unprofessional comment
I walked in a few minutes after friends and had no idea the restaurant had problems even though we had reservations
The restaurant wasn't even half full
I Looked at menu and then waiter yells well everyone has placed their dinner order and rushed my order by standing over me and breathing down my neck
Waiter gets one order totally wrong
Later two waiters decided to bodyguard our table; when my fork hits the plate it's snatched away
Forget the fact that I might of wanted the last drop of potatoes
I was treated rudely and my money was wasted on food that was over priced
This was suppose to be a celebration, however it turned out to be a huge disappointment!!!
Even though the hostess was friendly the restaurant was not accomadating
We had a 7'0clock reservation for nine people, two couldn't make it and two were running late
We were told that if they sat us they could only seat us for the about of people that were there and there was no guanrantee that they would accomodate the late people
The entire meal was rushed
The bustboys were stalking our tables
I've spent more time in a fast food restaurant
I have no idea why they were rushing us, because they were empty when we got there and they were empty when we left
I've had restaurants that were more crowded be more accomodating
Just to let you know how quick the meal was
We sat down at 7:15 and we were walking out at 8:27
My commute was longer
I don't know what was going on with the previous patrons, but this place was superb! The host was a charm, the food was excellent, and the atmosphere was great! I will definitely be going back again!
We had a great time
Food was fabulous

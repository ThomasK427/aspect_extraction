I never saw a place anything like it
This is the first fast healthy food place where everything is made when you order it
It takes a little time sometimes
But its worth it when you are eating the food and then the whole afternoon when I feel so good
to those that rated the Pump so negatively, the pump does have some very bland dishes like the Champion, but there are many others that are really good! Try the Dynamite w/ Chicken, the Deisel, Steak and Eggs for breakfast
Last but not least, you have to have the sweet potato/banana pie for dessert
Oh- and try the juices and shakes too!  Best part is that you can feel good about eating any of it
Myself being a sandwich lover and overall foodie, I highly reccomend this place
They use real ingredients like fresh turkey and they know how to make guacamole
The hardest part is choosing from their awesome array of sandwiches
Sandwiches are boring everywhere else BUT here
The worst part about this place is actually trying to decide among so many awesome sandwiches
Definitely try the poor girl, mini cristo and the french dip, then try the other billion sandwiches they have on their menu
order from here frequently
decent selection of sandwhiches, salads and burgers always well prepared
The Scene This East Village upstart proved to be so popular, the owners opened a second massive (and massively popular) location in Williamsburg
This original restaurant is miniscule in comparison, but it's designed in the same sleek lounge style
Service is brisk and friendly, and the hip, clubby music is never so loud that you have to shout to be heard
The Food Start with the spicy beef salad or the Tup Tim Fritters, fried chicken and shrimp balls served with a delectable sweet-and-sour dipping sauce
Both the tom kah soup and pad thai are merely serviceable
Move on to one of the noodle dishes: Drunk Man noodle tosses together chicken, shrimp, squid, basil and egg
Befitting the restaurant's name, fish dishes are the standout entrees
Try the Spicy Dark Ocean, a chili-powered concoction of red snapper and other seafood tossed with veggies and accented with white pepper
their green curry isn't spicy enough, the coconut flavor isn't rich enough either
this is not the place if you're looking for authenic Thai food
SEA has become so popular that they've let it go to their heads
It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence
The food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go
After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table
And, atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space, they left us awkardly seated
Needless to say, I'm never going back and you should be wary too
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go
What a great place
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty
I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place
I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door
The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside
I was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on
Too cold to enjoy
Awful from start to finish
Upon arrival there was not a host in sight which resulted in a couple arriving after us to be seated before us
We were escorted to a table twice and then turned back after losing our seats at the bar
We were subjected to the same CD over and over every 20 minutes
The host offered us 2 free appetizers; but, they were not of our choosing, just plopped down on the table
As for the food, we asked for nothing sweet
The waiter assured us it was spicy not sweet
Every dish from appetizer to soup to volcanic chicken was sickeningly SWEET
Not to mention that they served mushy CANNED peas and carrots in their dishes
This place may be cheap but as far as I wouldn't eat this place again if they were giving it away
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers
The food was spicy and delicious
It might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand
The place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate
My suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes
decor is cute and hip
service was prompt and friendly
food is flavorful
the lunch special menu is a good value
I didn't expect a good Thai place in the E
Village, but the city is full of surprises, including the fact that it's really inexpensive ($20 for a salad, drink, and entree after tax and tip)
The duck salad was on the overcooked side but tasty
The Spicy Dark Ocean was chock full of calamari, but nearly drowned in an overly salty brown sauce
My friends loved the Drunk Man noodles and sweet-ish pad thai
The All Asian drink special was as sweet as the lychee floating in the glass
We couldnt understand our servers accent sometimes but overall, with good, inexpensive food, trendy dcor and chill music, its not hard to see why Sea was packed on a Tuesday night
Good food- Great prices
Really inexpensive and the food is definitely a deal
However, if you are taking a date here or trying to impress, I would try somewhere else
The service is sadly, what you pay for
Confused and sub-par
I keep going down to the Sea, again again, for the unique mix of high-design / minimalist ambiance, electronica music and exceptional Thai food
I usually don't mind loud, crowded spots, but it used to seem literally elbow-to-elbow
They must have removed a few tables when they closed for rennovations over the winter; the extra space helps
The crowd sometimes seems to be uniformly 20 years old
but go in, order pad thai, green coconut milk chicken curry, spring rolls w/ extra peanut sauce and a couple frosty bottles of Singha beer
How do you say mmmm-good! in Siamese while groovin' to Massive Attack? Rest an elbow at the small pink-under-lit bar in the rear if you have to wait for a table, instead of hanging on the sidewalk
Sea consistently delivers awesome Thai vittles
and it's a very cool little subterranean spot
A wonderful place to bring friends and for a trendy meal
The ambiance is wonderful with a trendy eastern decor
The food is a bit spicy many dishes have a ginger in them
Overall a wonderful experiance for a low price
i have to agree it is the best tasting thai food in NYC
Their noodle dishes were perfect, not too saucey and not too dry
they don'd skim on the shrimps either
the Lemongrass chicken was mouthwatering
Portions are just right
my only complaint is the lighting of the restaurant
ITS WAY TOO DARK!!!!! i hope someone works there read this
we were literally eating blind
i don't understand why it is so dark in there
it is strictly a restaurant, there's no bar
the staff must have bad eyes from working there
in order for us to read our menus, we had to collect candles from other tables

Great food here, but be prepared to wait if you go in anytime during the weekend or weeknights
It's a tiny little place, and can feel a little cramped
The food is great though and one of the most inventive vegan/veggie places I have ever been to
Never had a bad dish here
It is not that affordable, but not that pricey either, somewhere in the middle
Leave your name with the host, give them your cell number, and go walk around W4th to kill time and wait for the call
The food at Red bamboo, generally speaking, is quite good, but not quite top notch
While the faux meet is very well done, and presentation excellent, I find in more than a few dishes the sauce to be so heavy as too overwhelm the actual food
The mango salsa with fish cake was too sour, the apple suace for pork chop too sweet
However, the appetizers I've tried (rolls, calamari, fish fingers) were really delicious
Dessert was pretty good too
The service, while polite, can be aggravating slow
Once we got here on weekend night and a 20-min wait turned into 50 minutes
The food took another half hour
While I liked the place, I'd never come back in a weekend night again, and with reservations
This has become one of my most favorite places to dine lately
I love vegetarian food (although I am not) and this place has some of the best in all NYC
Try the dragonfly rolls, the pork chops, voo doo sticks and anything with mango
Plus the staff is knowledgeable helpful, so you are guarenteed good service for it's price
You won't be disappointed!
I was drawn to Red Bamboo because they had vegetarian fried shrimp
As a Louisiana girl gone vegetarian, fried shrimp were the one food that called to me from the carnivorous world
These vegetarian beauties are AMAZING! I'm completely addicted
Whenever I'm in the neighborhood, I drop by for a quick snack or a meal or I grab some takeout to enjoy later at home
The staff is really nice and helpful and the portions are generous
I am not at all a vegetarian but we decided to take out our very vegetarian friend out for her birthday
We chose this restaurant because of all the good reviews
I made the reservation a week in advance for 7 people
It took them an hour to seat us
This is definately not a good place for groups because it seemed that we took up the first half of the restaurant
But to make up for the wait, the food was fabulous
I must say that if I could eat or cook food the way they make it here, I would gladly become a vegetarian
Don't expect the real thing and you won't be disappointed
I am a transitional Vegetarian
I'm basically trying hard
Red Bamboo was introduced to me by a vegan freind and I fell in love
I can't wait to go back
It get's pretty busy especailly around dinner time so call in advance to make a reservation
My boyfriend who is NOT a vegetarian went with me the second time and he loved it
The staff is really nice, the place is quaint and once again the food rocks
Definitley give it a chance, I'm sure you'll love it
After reading the many good reviews I decided to venture to Red Bamboo
It was nearly 5:30 on a Friday evening and the restaurant was already busy
As I was by myself I was quickly seated
If you don't like sitting close to others then I wouldn't recommend this restaurant
I was so close to a couple that came in after me that they started a conversation with me
It took a while for the waiter to aknowledge my presence eventually I ordered and appetizer and sandwich
For an appetizer I enjoy the Thai Vegetable Rolls
The rolls were well sized and tastey
I ordered the Seitan Sandwich with a salad
Food was served promptly though I recieved fries instead of salad
Quickly fixed
Had a piece of pecan pie for desert
Was not worth the $6 price
Overall I spent $21 before tip
Enjoyed my experience
I'm a non-veggie so I usually don't eat the faux-meat dishes, but my friend insisted that Red Bamboo had the best soy meat
She was right!  The Tandoori Chicken Supreme was AMAZING and just-the-right-amount-of-spicy, and it actually tasted BETTER than chicken
Also, the grilled soy beef Voodoo Sticks were terrific too
I've tried to go veggie off-and-on for years
Red Bamboo will help me stay on the veggie wagon when I have those meat-taste cravings! Thanks Red Bamboo!!
I couldn't believe how tasty and authentic the fish, chicken and shrimp-like veggie dishes were
Combined with excellent sauces and a very nice presentation I have to say that Red Bamboo was outstanding for this new vegetarian
One word of advice to the NYU students eating there, however
There is virtually nothing on the menu that two people can get that would justify a $2 tip, especially when breaking mommy's $100 bill
Spread the love with the terrific waitstaff next time!
I'm in the process of becoming a vegetarian and it's been very difficult because i desperately missed the taste of chicken and meat
Red Bamboo is a miracle for people like me! The food was delicious
I had the chicken quesadilla and was incredibly surprised at how delicious it was
My boyfriend, who's a life time vegetarian, said it was the best food he had in the city
The waitress and atmosphere were great
We'll definitely be back soon
P
S
Try their cranberry and orange juice
juice
It's to die for!
I was only in town for 41 /2 days but ended up going back to eat there a twice because it was so good
The lady I was traveling with is a hard core carnivore but ended up being really surprised and loved it too
It's really refreshing for a long term vegetarian from Iowa to be able to eat everything on a menu at restaurant (there are only 2 places where I live that are that way) The food and service was excellent and very efficient
I especially loved the BBQ wings but would reccomend pretty much anything
It was also nice that everything was made form scratch too and not pre packaged substitutes
Very affordable too
will definetly go back next time I'm in town
Awesome vegetarian soul food restaurant with a lengthy and diverse menu
Even carnivores like it
Try the shrimp appetizer (you won't know it is from the vegetable kingdom) and the codfish cakes
Leave room for dessert, their non dairy ice cream and sundaes are amazing
Easily one of the best restaurants in New York that offer vegan/vegetarian cuisine
Favorite dishes amongst me and friends include the soul chicken sandwich, Bamboo club, Philly cheesesteak, buffalo chicken wings, and the grilled chicken salad
Personally, they make some of the best Miso soup I've ever tasted- they load it with vegetables so its more hearty than your average miso soup
The desserts are absolutely to die for - excellent cakes (try the Peanut Butter Tandy Cake), delicious non-dairy ice cream and even better milkshakes! The waitstaff is by far one of the most friendly I've ever encountered  On the downside, the restaurant is extremely small and there tends to be long waits to be seated in the evenings and on weekends when it gets crowded
However, the food there is superb and well worth the wait
Highly recommended for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike!
I've been a vegetarian since I was 9 years old and this is an excellent restaurant
The key is to know what to order
My friends and I love the buffalo wings, bourbon chick and the soul chicken
The soul chicken is straight up out of control
For those vegetarians who liked the taste of meat but decided to change for different reasons, this place has some very very good food
Also, the buffalo wings are better in the restaurant than they are delivered

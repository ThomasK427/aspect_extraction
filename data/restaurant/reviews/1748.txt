The Southern and Jamaican foods are both very authentic and tasty
Love their red velvet cake
We had 8:00 reservations for Valentine's Day
Waited at the bar (great margarita) but did were not seated for dinner until 9:25
Had our order taken at 9:45
Waitress brought our entrees, but SKIPPED our appetizers, at 10:20
The host acknowledged poor service, offered drinks on the house, which showed up with the bill at 10:40
The food was superb (at least the corn bread and entrees), but I have never received such poor service
So disappointed, but cannot possibly go back after that
This is one of my favorite restaurants
They recently renovated so it is slightly bigger than before
I recommend the Catfish w/ mased potatoes and string beans, the baby doll drink, and the carrot cake
On Saturday night, my girlfriend had a craving for Jamaican Jerk Chicken, so we decided on Maroons since the reviews looked enticing
We showed up at 9:30 and the host said it would be 20 minutes
As we waited at the poorly situated bar, waitstaff brushed against us continually as they passed
We finally scored two stools at the bar
Well, 20 minutes turned into an hour
Finally, we were seated in the crammed dining room
The waitress came to take our order and casually informed us that they ran out of jerk-chicken
Call me crazy, but a Jamaican restaurant's ONLY job is to NEVER run out of jerk chicken!!!! So, we left and went to Day-O, a few blocks away and it was 100 times better - more spacious, better portions and a more fun crowd
Their food was excellent and we got to sit down right away
I read a review about this place in Newsday and was excited to go
The restaurant did not dissappoint
The service was great, the food was delicious, and the yellow cake with chocolate frosting is really just like mama used to make
This is a great place for good home cooking!
Went with a group of four, which is probably the largest size you want to take there
The space is very intimate and it's amazing they manage to turn out the food they do with a kitchen that's about the size of a large elevator
Everyone on my table preferred the vegetable sides to their main courses and we all agreed that the Southern dishes were tastier than the Jamaican
But all fish dishes were good
The service was just unbearably slow - we were seated at 9:15 and didn't leave till 12:30
Perhaps that kitchen's just a tad too small?
To this teeny restaurant where the waitress serves one person at a time
The drinks are very pricey and small, and the food is ok - but the portion size for the price is outrageous
This place was truly amazing
the manager/hostess was warm, kind and had a great smile
the food was out-of-this world
i loved the mac and cheese and grits
the red velvet cake for dessert is a good chioce
try the watermelon martini
i can't wait to go back
As a transplanted Southerner, this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in New York
Great food, great energy and good prices
Service was a bit slow on the night we went but the (free) red velvet cake made up for it
Will definitely go back again and again

Get the fried chicken with mac cheese!
Maroons is a nice space, where a diverse crowd comes to eat good food, and not to be concerned about noise, atmosphere or anything else
The staff is good on the verge of great
The food is amazing, with a selection to match
The drinks are pricey (but where aren't they), and the food prices were modest
Cornbread to die for, and desserts that take you back to a better time
Reservations required Thu-Sun, mine was honored
Owners on site and management which made me feel important
Can't wait to go back
Maroon's is great for dinner, drinks, or events
The space is a little tight, but the food makes up for it
The room was too warm, the service not warm enough and my fried chicken cold
And the owner didnt seem to care, she was more interested in talking at the bar than hearing from me
Nuf said
Not my best experience
It was okay
There aren't that many soul food places to go to in the city aside from going all the way up to Harlem
The pork chop and jerk chicken was very tasty, however the oxtail was a huge disappointment to me
If you are in the mood for some soul food and you want somewhere close, this would be a good choice
Service was not terrific
The staff was a bit slow
Overall not bad
they could stand to regulate their air conditioning
I've been there several times and highly recommend Maroons, but it is ALWAYS too hot when I'm there
And I really wish they would stop trying to squeeze everyone onto one side of the restaurant when they have a whole other side that is UNOCCUPIED
That is greatly frustrating! And
I wonder why they stopped frying the catfish
Now it's baked and nowhere near as good
Also a great place for brunch
in particular the Chicken Waffles
The atmosphere is nice and authentic
The seating is simply too tight and its hard to get comfortable
The main reason for going to a restauarnt is food: Because of the extremely small size of the kitchen, it appears that many of the appetizersand entrees are prepared earlier on in the day and simply kept warm until they are served
This definitelywas the case with my fried fish, which should arrive completely hot and fresh and simply was not
The hype of the place (along with the hype for this type of food at the moment) contributes to an experiene that simply does not live up to a value at all
Perhaps the best kept secret in Chelsea -- both for quality and value
The lunch menu is an especially good deal
I recommend it highly
The place is overrated and overpriced
I think they need a real Caribbean chef
I went once with my husband and never again, the host was distracted, the double entrance thing is confusing to a first timer
The service overall was good
I did not enjoy my meal
The menu consists of meals your mom used to make, but MUCH better
Fried green tomatos were delicious
The grits were BEST (and the only I've ever liked
) Overall the food was very good
The service was slow (10 minutes for drinks??) The food OK (DRY fried chicken, overcooked pork, great mac and cheese) I dont understand the high rating
Dont be fooled
It gets no better than this
The service was so gracious, the menu impressive and the food was just heaven on earth
We loved this wonderful little restaurant!
A friend took me for dinner 3 weeks ago and I've been back with my boyfriend 6 TIMES since then
The best brunch in NYC! And let me tell you the grits are to die for! I never order them because chefs tend to make make them too runny, too stiff, too whatever

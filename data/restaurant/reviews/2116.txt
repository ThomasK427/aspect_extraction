The bar's old Greenwich Village charm, as well as the fact that food is served until the bar closes late at night, solidify its status at the best burger joint in NYC
A great place to come if, like me, you are on a tight budget and in need of some wholesome, filling, unhealthy food
No frills, just good burgers n beer!
Corner Bistro has great burgers, but the best in New York are available at the Smith Wollensky Grill on 49th Street around the corner from the Steak House of the same name
Along with fries and a pickle, their burgers are delightful, and they are enormous - a burger lovers dream!
There's nothing good about this place, and if you think this is a good burger place you don't know what a good burger is
It took us about 30 minutes to get seated, the burgers came without lettuce, they brougt us the wrong drinks, and the flavor of the burgers were below average
I will never go back to this place
It was a disappointment
Great date spot, don't take your high maintenance women here, they just don't understand
Great selections on the jukebox
Great burger and honestly some of the best bathroom graffiti in the city
Corner Bistro has what one might call the best Burger in town, but it is just that: Only a burger
Nothing exciting about it
You have to go across town to St
Dymphna's in the East Village
There the burgers are like a prty for your mouth
And when I say party, I mean Super!
I have no idea how this got ratted the best burger in town
But its like a regular, dinner bugger
plain bun, ugly lettuce, and the first time i ordered it, it was raw(like purple), and they gave me attitude for sending it back
I will give it this
its a great dive bar,,,perfect place to have a drink with an old man with no teeth
To eat in a hurry and get a seat make sure you arrive before 6pm! It gets super packed, but you can always have a few beers at the bar while you wait! Dont forget to try the chicken sandwich, to die for
Can't understand why this places get all this hype
It's a good burger but there are plenty of Greek diners around where you get something comparable
The line for burgers stretch through the bar area which make it very uncomfortable and inconvenient for those waiting in line and those just having a drink at the bar
Once you're seated it is VERY cramped (they stuffed my party of 6 onto a table for 4) and they accomodate my request for fried onions
All in all, the burgers here are good but not worth the aggravation
Corner Bistro, despite the hoopla and critical praise, is nothing more than a burger joint with long lines
The burgers are boring and have limited flavor
The bandwagon is full and needs to be unloaded in the Hudson with the rest of the waste
Taste buds should determine the true champion
which CB does not deserve
The joint is old but the beer is cold
The burger is sloppy but sensational
The fries are fantastic
And every now or then you can walk right in sit right down and go to town on the best burger in town!
I won't say that the burgers are bad, but they are not deserving of the lofty praise given in previous reviews
I think maybe everyone goes there drunk and we all know anything tatses good drunk
I'll say this - they're greasy little buggers, and small too
But hey, they're only burgers
Can't say I recommend, but no need to stay away either
Just lower your expectations
this place has become such a tourist trap
Bohemian bar no more
the burgers are marginal at best
some people rave about them, but they really are just okay
this place gets way too crowded as well
if you are gonna go, try and hit it off hours
avoid it on the weekends or on thurday nights
I agree
Corner Bistro is a little hard to find after a night of partying
But the burgers are the best along with anything choice of beveregs that is serverd
These burger are tastier than eveny Wendy's,McDonalds,Burger King,White Castle
All American plus any diner,resturant,fast food joint combinded
They are that good
The least metinioned fact is that these hurgers are very digestable
Nor heartburn/acid refluex/gas
etc erver after eating at the Corner Bistro
The beer is still cheap, the line is still long and the waiters are still disinterested (to put it mildly)
Unfortunately, the burgers have changed
Perhaps it's the stinginess with the cheese (only one slice?) or the increase in tables which worsens an already crowded place
There are better places for a burger, although maybe not at 3am
cool crowd, geat jukebox, good atmosphere, and some bad ass burgers
The Corner Bistro burger is the culinary equivalent of a British art-house picture; it sounds great, it looks fabulous, but you walk away feeling that it really could have done with just a little
something
In this case, cheese
Sure, the patty is fat and visually impressive, albeit a little more well-done than we would have preferred, but where was the cheese? A single processed slice serving as the wispiest of garnishes
It's good, but there are better out there
and with shorter queues
for those who argue it's hard to find and for those who argue the burger's no good, you must be from mars and you must be damn lazy
unless you like your restaurants screaming with neon and stuck in the middle of times square, then a hard to find favorite like corner bistro is in the perfect place
it's enjoyable to tell a cabbie, corner bistro, west 4th and jane, off 8th ave
and 12th street's right there too
you know that weird little corner right
they always tell me, sure and that sends me on my way to the easiest drinking beers, best tunes, and juiciest burger in town
corner bistro is a classic in every way
the hype is not hype, it's just the truth
Besides being a mediocre burger, this place is a dump! Paper plates, plastic cups, dirty tables
Maybe with a hangover this is overlooked but for those of us in search of a great burger, it's just a disappointment
The place is hard to find and the cab drivers don't know how to take you here - these signs are telling you something
It doesn't want to be found
I had one burger here and was still hungry
and couldn't find a good reason to have another one
Now that is not a good sign
The burger was nothing special, I really don't understand the hype
Did I come to the right Corner Bistro? Was it just a bad burger making day in the kitchen? Everyone with me was in agreement
If you want a REALLY GREAT burger, go to McHales, now that is not only dee-licious, but a great deal as well
Awesome place for a delicous burger and a few pints
McSorlies pints are only $2! Where else can you get a deal like that
Though its tough to get a table, almost always swamped buts worth the waite
Wholly crap, that is one good burger!! But good luck finding it, no cab driver knows how to get to the cross-streets
In search of the best burger in town, the corner bistro was alright but I can't say much else
Besides the dark, dank surroundings, the burger was just alright
Disappointing with all the hype I had heard about them
Excellent burgers! I'm from Houston, TX but NYC is my 2nd home
and I've had plenty of good burgers in Texas
But NONE still compare to the burgers I've had at Corner Bistro! A MUST-EAT! The ambience is also classic, and non-pretentious!
Cheap beer might explain the remarkable number of high ratings

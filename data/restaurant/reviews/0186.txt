Crazy
To be fair, my $10 open-faced mushroom sandwich was delicious and quite large
So, if you don't care about speedy service, go; but if you aren't in the habit of lighting your cigarette with twenties, avoid the tapas
(People are saying a lot about the ambience, but it's actually much more restaurant-generic than any of the previous incarnations
Pity
)
My hubby and I enjoyed Pipa last night for the first time
A co-worker of mine had gone there the night before and RAVED about the food
I am a little bit more picky but had to agree the food was pretty good--but VERY EXPENSIVE
a fun place to go with a group I think more than a first date since the tables are so close and the restaurant can be a bit noisy and crowded
Overall I would go back there but with a group
I don't think the pretty chandeliers or cozy atmosphere are worth the overpriced food
The octopus, tortilla espaniola, and seafood paella all tasted like they had been sitting on the counter for days
To add to the trauma, me and my boyfriend walked in to stand around like idiots while no one came to seat us
The hostess appeared as soon as we decided to seat ourselves and shot us dirty looks the rest of the evening
The waiter was prompt though, to be fair
Now, we went there for the tapas when they first opened and were very pleased with it all--drinks, portions etc
I was there two weeks ago with friends and while the lunches were fine the sangria was vile--it tasted like a peach schnapps punch made in a dorm
Today
well, while the tapas were tasty, I still think that if it's plural on the menu, it should be plural on the plate
$55 for two glasses of wine, 5 stuffed dates, 8 lamb meatballs the diameter of a quarter and ONE potato fritter with a sardine on top
I know tapas are small plates, but when it first opened anyway, there was actually food on them
Absolutely incredible atmosphere for a groups, couples, singles -- and anyone looking to have a good time!!! Not only was the food incredible (and very reasonably priced), but the staff was friendly and knowledgable about their product (which is hard to find these days)
The Sangria is a MUST along with the countless AMAZING appetizers
I definitely recommend this hotspot for people as a pre- or post-night out for a way to wind up or down; both of which are abetted by the chic and cute decor and candle-light glow
This restaurant has managed to become one of my favorites because of all of it's character!!!
Went on a Friday night
We waited at the bar for only 10 minutes (we had a reservation) - can't complain about that, the restaurant was full and I enjoyed the lively atmosphere and music
Bartenders could use some 'sensitivity training,' but when I start letting bartenders and waitstaff effect my evening I have larger problems
Service was efficient and the food excellent
I'd definately go back again
The decor is intoxicating, but next time I'll just shop at ABC
Our group of 6 waited over 1 1/2 hours for our first course to be served and another hour for our main course
Drinks took forever and were often incorrect
Nothing arrived at the same time, leaving some guests being polite and letting their food go cold, and others feeling hungry and uncomfortable for up to 20 minutes
The music overwhelmed all conversation
Truly, a badly managed establishment
Never, ever, ever do I go to the same restaurant in one week! but this place needed me
or I needed this place
When you walk in, it's like you're walking into another world
I can't think of any place that compares to the atmosphere at Pipa
Not to mention the best sangria I've ever tasted
I went with a bunch of friends, so we got to taste a LOT of tapas and they were all delicious
Some classic and some totally new! One cool thing was that the desserts were actually descent
Actually they were more than descent
I had a dessert there that I'd never seen anywhere or imagined
It was some strawberry cake with roses?! Let me tell you it was delicious! I don't know where it came from but it works!
Great food, great atmosphere, reasonable prices, and the service was great
If you are looking for a place to chill with at few friends this place is great
I love this place! I used to go every time I came into the city and now I leave nearby
The food and sangria are excellent and it's fun to go with a group of people
Have the waiter/waitress bring you a bunch of their favorites and you will not be disappointed! I just realized that ABC also owns Lucy and now I see why I liked that place too
Enjoy!
I had heard about the Sangria before but what a great place! I went on a Thursday night with a group of 8 friends
We sat at the bar tables and tried almost one of every tapa and had several pitchers of their famous sangria
One of the managers even braught over some molotov shots for some of my girlfriends to try
Everyone had such a good time
The food was excellent, the service outstanding
Salsa music, funky chandeleirs, and candles created a very warm and rustic environment
I would recommend it to anyone
I booked Pipa recently for a dinner party of about 17 people
We had an incredible time
The atmosphere is great and the food is great as well
I've been to Pipa a few times in the past as a couple an it has been great every time
It's unfortunate that some people have had bad experiences there
This restaurant is definitely worth a second chance
Great sangria as well :)
The restaurant is a wonderful place to go out with friends
Have a pitcher of cool sangria with a great atmosphere
The rhythm of latin music makes you shake
The food is good as well as the service
I consider this restaurant an excellent tapas place in NYC
went for a birthday celebration
great food but really incompetent service--forgot orders, poured some drinks but not others
disappeared for half an hour at a time--not something you can do at a tapas bar, where the idea is to order continually all evening! management was indifferent to our complaints, and the waitstaff was outright defensive
only the coat-check girl and restroom attendant behaved with class and professionalism
they even charge you if you don't show up for your reservation! who ever heard of such a thing? don't waste your money here
Food was OK, but I was still hungry
Not just that tapas was small portions (duh) but, for example, $10 piggy-back dates only came with 6 little appetizers
Staff wouldn't take no for an answer on pitchers of sangria
$30 pitchers I might add (for sangria?!?)
Asked everyone at the table all night and brought it even when everyone said no
Can we have another order of these three plates does not mean Double the entire order  Ended up paying almost $80 a head
How unfortunate
:-( We have been to Pipa many times and have always counted on a quality dining experience
This past Friday, the service was terrible (we waited 15 minutes for a menu), the food was mediocre (don't get the octopus, I am an octopus lover and it was not very good), the music terrible (I would expect more from an affilitation of ABC then to play pop trance during the dinner hours)
I'd always been pleased with Pipa
I am very dissapointed
Went to Chicama and loved their food! Expected as much from Pipa but was disappointed in the quality
The food was in no way sub-par
it just didn't meet up to the standards of its sister restaurant
The dishes were more of a hit or miss situation
If you got lucky you had a great dish, otherwise it was just fair
Some excellent points of Pipa: delicious sangria, great atmosphere with beautiful decor and its very attentive friendly staff
After hearing that our dinner group was for a birthday, the manager gave the birthday girl a free shot
Overall, the experience there was great, but if you are more about food than anything else, take a stroll around the block to Chicama for a better fare of food
Recently celebrated a birthday here with some friends
The food is very very good, but it's the room and overall atmosphere that made the night a swinging success
The decor looks like a bull just tore through a 19th Centrury sea-side villa as he made his escape from the Stadium
Get anything they make with squid! The Paella is quite good too

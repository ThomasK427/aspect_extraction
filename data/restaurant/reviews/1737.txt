My husband and I went to tabla for dinner and except for the appetizer, the special tomato/fennel soup and the bread the main entree left much to be desired
The entree menu needs some innovation and changing
The wine and dessert was excellent!!
The juxtaposition between the downstairs Bread Bar and the upstairs main dining room is not unlike the split personality at Meyer's Gramercy Tavern (where the front Tavern section is fun and casual and the rear main dining room is small, quiet, and, for some, a bit stuffy)
As for the food, the bread is great; Skate, OK; Scallops; good
The main dining room is a bit exclusive (it's small and there isn't any background music)
I always find the decor and Meyer's restaurants a bit too conservative to impress me, but nevertheless the atmosphere is still relaxing and in terms of the service, you always feel you're in good hands
The past two times I've been to Tabla the food has been great
The service, though, has not
Our wine was not brought out until AFTER our entree was served
We waited TWO hours to get our entree, which they eventually did not charge us for
thank God
Refilling drinks is a foreign concept here
This place needs new management and new waitstaff
The scallops were the best I have ever had, and the chocolate passion-fruit dessert was amazing
The whole culinary experience was top notch
(my wife, ordered the steak, which wasn't imaginative like the other dishes - just run of the mill)  Service was decent, but not very warm and friendly
The appetizers were good
No complaints, in fact, they were quite enjoyable
The nightmare begins with the entrees
The grill person neglected to remove the butcher's twine from the pork loin
The lobster was so undercooked the dept of health would have had field day
To make amends for this, they brought us an extra course, halibut fillet, which initially the waiter told us they had 86'd
The sauces on 3 of the entrees and most of the sides were way over seasoned (with salt)
I think the sous needs to pay a little more attention to his line
and Mr
Meyer needs to pay a little more attention to Tabla
The waitstaff was incredible
They saw we were celebrating a special occasion and gave us little sweets on a plate with the words Congratulations written in chocolates, a small gold box with more chocolate in it, and a Zagats guide
Food was great too!
Tabla has gone even higher in price and lower in quality
I ordered a drink made with champagne and it was almost room temperature
My partner's drink was a big and flat tasting bore
The appetisers, bread and dessets were excellent but the main courses though well executed were rote and uninteresting as if they decided to play it safe or just stop trying to be inventive
There was only one vegetarian main course-in the past they used to have several
The wine list (with half bottles too) and staff remain as benchmarks
Tabla is still good but at these prices it should not have these flaws that it didn't have before
Truly, a great dining experience
We had reservations and were seated promptly
The service was great, the waiter friendly, knowledgable and helpful
It was an expensive meal but well worth the money paid
Very well done
While it's not cheap, a beautiful laid-back setting with one of the best prix-fixe and tasting menu deals in the city (you can choose anything from the menu for your 3-courses on the prix-fixe)
Indian-fusion at its best
Have the banana bread pudding for dessert!
I celebrated my birthday in the bread bar on a saturday night
The service was excellent except that our entrees did not arrive at the same time
I'd say I got mine about 5 minutes later which seems like a lifetime when the person across from you has their food and wants to eat it! Other than that everything was great! I had the pulled lamb sandwich mustard mashed potatoes sandwich on naan
it was AWESOME! the glazed doughnut holes for dessert were delivered nice hot but really no different than a zeppole you'd get at an italian festival
I would definitely go back and try other things
Most Indian restaurants in the West serve the same North Indian flavor of red tomato paste with garlic and ginger
This was completely different
The fish (skate) was lightly breaded and so flaky and the spices so subtle - Hmmmm! And the dessert - I was almost afraid to stick my spoon in - it was a work of art! The chocolate -strawberrry whatsit was just perfect!!! OUTSTANDING
Very pretty room, excellent service, but the food left a lot to be desired
Celebrated a birthday here last night; the crab cake appetizer was flavorful and interesting, but the fettucine were drowned in onion and full of interesting spices that simply did not work
As main courses, salmon (ordered it medium and it came to the table rare) and skate (bland)
The side order of cheese nan was a joke, and consisted of microwaved cheese
The food deserved a 4/10 at the most! But the service was special: after only a casual mention of a birthday when making the reservation, they figured out who the birthday person was and brought a complementary dessert with a candle, as well as a little package with truffles as we left
It almost made up for the uninteresting meal! Also, the wine list was great; few restaurants offer so many half-bottle choices!
I was there on New Years Eve with a party of four with no reservation
No problem
We were seated promply and enjoyed a fabulous meal served family style with a variety of meats and vegetables
Absolutely divine! Their wine list is also quite excellent
And our server was friendly and helped us make some tasty choices
I have had Indian fusion in India, London and U
S
Tabla is unquestionably the best
Floyd's ability to use the indian spices in a manner that is highly flavorful and yet not being pungent to the palate is extraordinary
If you are looking for authentic Indian cuisine, this is not the place to go but if you are looking great, flavorful fusion cuisine with an Indian bent
This is as good as it gets!!!
Inventive, quality food with attentive service but it's expensive
Wonderful, upscale decor without being stuffy
Innovative Indian fare
We waited a long time to be seated, and then for the waiter when we were finally seated
Portions are small and expensive
The appetizer was great, but the entrees were either too salty or too tough or too tart
Overall, it wasn't a good experience
Their only saving grace was that both the waiter and the manager could tell that we weren't having a good time so they came over and tried to be as helpful as possible
If not for them, this would have been an utter disaster
We had the fall tasting menuit was superb
Every course was prepared well and presented well
The waiter was the best
He explained everything and made sure we were happy
Couldn't sop eating the nan
Wow, Wow, Wow!
Tabla is superb
I've been there a couple of times and I am always impressed
Bread Bar is great for a cheaper alternative
The service is smart and helpful
Whenever a special occasion comes up, this is my first choice
We had five of us for dinner and were treated well
The food was rather pricey but for a special occasion was worth it
I had the rack of lamb which in my opinion was the best I have ever had
Other people in my party did not like their meals as much
The Prix Fair dinner for $57
00 is the way to go
As for the atmosphere, it's beautiful, trendy and classy
The food was really good, especially the Indian Risotto on the sampling menu! They matched the wine up very well with the food
Extensive wine list
Expensive

This is NOT a sushi restaurant
You might get some sushi with your meal, and it will be among the very best you will ever have, but you will pay for it
This is the restaurant that changed my previously negative views on uni (sea urchin roe) by serving up a truly exquisite piece
For $60 bucks at Sugiyama you will get food that you have never eaten before, food that is rare, delicate, gorgeous, and simple
Sugiyama is truly amazing!
So good it almost can't be put into words
Tantalizing, Different, Delicious, A fair Price, Wonderful!
I was lucky enough to have dinner at this restaurant recently
I think I can safely say it was one of the best meals of my life
The chef, who is a genius, took me and my date on a journey
It's hard to believe someone could be that clever with food
It defied understanding
Sometimes you realize that food, in the hands of the right person, is an artform of personal expression
I cant wait to go back
After more trips to the Big Apple then I can count, I never miss a stop at the Olympic
Is it Tavern on the Green? No
Is it Ristorante Grifone? No
Is it just as amazing, in it's own way, as any top of the line, all too kitsch, upper crust NYC eatery? ABSOLUTELY! This is a classic hole-in-the wall NY restaurant
With everything imaginable on the menu and an attempt at anything that's not, I've never met a more accomodating staff
The look isn't stellar, but you'll find none cleaner
The food is prepared by a master chef, but the cook does a damn fine job, as it were, on everything that comes out of that kitchen
This is truly a place you shouldn't miss
Oh, did I mention the fact that the prices are INCREDIBLY REASONABLE?!!!
I was there last friday night with some friends ,and at first I was a little upset cose I waited for about 20 minuts, but it was all worth it, since at the moment we were being seated they started passing tamborines and the party began
The food was excellent and the very good concidering the place was jammed packed
I would recomend it and definetly ill be going back
I love the food
On Friday I went there with some friends I had chicken agro dolce, yummy, the best chicken I have ever had juicy and tasty and heavenly good
The atmosphere is great we had a lot of fun we play tambourines and sing and dance
Great time, not expensive, great service we loved our waiter
The service was awful
We had reservations for 6PM and still had to wait even though there were empty tables in the place
They rush you mercilessly
Not only did they bring out my entree before I was finished with my salad, the tried to take the salad bowl away at the same time
The food is pedestrian
I got the feeling that if you are not with a large group, and spending a lot of money on booze, they're mission is to get you out of there as quickly as possible
Do yourself a favor if you want Italian
Walk a few blocks over to Times Square and eat at Olive Garden
The food, service and atmosphere is better!
We went there a few weeks ago for a 'girls night out' and had a blast! We were a group of 8 recent college grads, and enjoyed the music, the food, and the drinks
Everything was reasonably priced, and there was a good vegetarian selection as well
We would all go back there anytime!
I'd heard a lot about Mangia e Bevi, so I made reservations weeks in advance to dine there with my wife and three children
Not only were our reservations not honored, we weren't even allowed to come in, although it was cold, windy and rainy outside
In fact, we were told to go away by the surly goon at the door
The treatment was outrageous!
This is the 3rd time I have taken a group of out of towners there and the 3rd time it has been a blast! We went last weekend
We had to wait maybe 10 min
after our reservation to be seated and we got 3 free rounds of shots throughout the night! William, the manager, was excellent
He came to our table, got to know us, pulled us out to dance with him, etc
The food was good but it comes in big portions so if you are drinking a lot you could easily share a plate
It's packed but once you keep drinking it really doesn't matter
Thanks William! You rock!
I highly recommend this place
Went there saturday for my b'lorette party with a group of 8 and we had so much fun! We were late for our reservations but we lucked out and got a table pretty quickly
It was the best way to start off the night! The tables are close but it made it more fun cuz everyone ended up talking to other people w/o it being annoying
Everyone seemed to be celebrating something
The food was pretty good and for a city restaurant the prices were very reasonable
If it's a special occasion and you want a fun way to celebrate, this is the place!!
Although the wait was long, I had a blast
If you are not on a tight schedule, this is the place to go for fun
The food is great, the dancing on the tables is so fun, and you leave there in the mood to party
I was here two years ago and I had an AWESOME time; food, drink, friends, what more could you want? This year we went back
Same great atmosphere, BUT the food was horrible
I ordered the Swordfish special, which was over-priced, but I figured, 'hey, why not?' What they brought out was not Swordfish, I'm not sure it was even fish
And they wouldn't take it back
And they were rude about it
It totally ruined a nice night
No one liked their food and the drinks were only half full when we received them
I don't know what happened since I was last there, but I won't be going back
A buddy and I went there for a drink and a quick eat
The food was good, just ordered two apps
to chew on while drinking
Most of the patrons were women, so that was a plus for me to look at
The staff then passed around tamborines and pumped the sing-along music and people started to stand on chairs, around tables and sang along
It was fun
I'd go back
I was expecting this to be an annoying gimmicky overpriced place but I really ended up enjoying it
I went for a bachelorette party, and like other reviewers said, we were seated very late
But once seated the service was excellent, the food was fantastic and very reasonably priced especially for the city
The brides were able to enjoy being the center of attention without being embarassed in front of a crowd
I would definitely recommend it as a way to kick off a fun night out
Dont go if youre on a schedule
My friends and I went to dinner for a bachelorette party,hoping it would be a fun night, and we got the complete oppossite
The person at the door who says to be the manager is so rude and unarticulate,that it's hard to believe he is who he says
We were told that there would be a wait, but not for an hour and a half, and than to be rushed throughout dinner in an hour
The food was pretty good and the atmosphere great,but I would not go back because of the lack of management
,
This is a nice choice for dinner for those Brides who do not want to do a trans-gender place
They have a moment where the Bride does get the full attention of the room without being motified
It was fun and upbeat
Our Bride stood on her chair danced, was sang to and did a shot
The food was really good
The only problem was they were NOT prompt with seating at all ( 1 hour behind) at 6pm, so allow time
We told the manager that we have to go but he insured us that we would make our next destination and we did
Our food come out within 5 minutes of us ordering
I definatly would go back
Not for Kids!
I made reservations for my sister's bachelorette party 6 wks in advance, the website claims it's good for bachelorette parties, and they gave me such an attitude
He told me on the phone I would have to wait a long time, and I couldn't add anymore people to the reservation

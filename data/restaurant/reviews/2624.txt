This time, however, I noted that one of the waitstaff was especially gruff and seemed to have an attitude of Why do EYE have to SERVE you? Food portions were meager for the price (despite location), although quality was acceptable
Naan came unbuttered, a minor sign of cheapness
A more major sign of cheapness was that the chairs were dirty, and mine was actually falling apart
They probably hadn't been changed since the last time we went
First of all, the buffet lunch for $14
00 is an excellent deal
The food is good, and the mango lassi was good as well
I enjoyed my dining experience, and would definitely return
The lamb and chicken are very well prepared and very tender
The bread, appetizers, and other entrees were also quite good
Overall, for $14, you can have an excellent lunch, and enjoy a nice Indian meal
Dinner is a bit more pricey, so lunch may be the better option for some, but either way you are sure to enjoy your dining experience
I really liked this place
we went there with a group of about 20 people from my bank and they gave us a private room
Food was excellent though the service could have been better
Great value for money
Walked away feeling satistfied
I have been going to Jewel of India since they first opened and love this place
The service is great and the food is good
I do not think this place is expensive its right in the theatre district
A pretty decent restaurant with a good ambience
I come from a city blessed with numerous Italian (as in born there) cooks, and I have had several meals at La Strada, all of which have been excellent
I would not hesitate to recommend it, even to the Agnones, the Bronzos, and the Castrogiovannis
In addition it has a real New York feel to an out-of-towner
I heard about it from a friend who has visited there for years and says she's never been disappointed
I made a lunch reservation for 4 people
The ages ranged from 7 to 55 and we were all thrilled
I even found the restaurant through City Search! The service was great, we were in and out in an hour
We all had seafood (mussels, clams, scallops) and the sauce and the fish were fresh
The price was great! With 3 adult entrees, 1 child size portion, 3 beers and 1 martini the bill was about $80! We did not have dessert or coffee only because we were full and the 7 yo was ready to go
I read about La Strada before I left for my NYC vacation
I was strolling Times Square looking for a good meal when I came to La Strada
What a treat
Great service and food was as good as any Italian I ever eaten
Really enjoyed the meal
Even better I enjoyed seeing my tab
Very reasonable and I would highly recommend
While I can't vouch for their slightly high prices (see Chinatown), I have to remember that being in another location (midtown) can really determine the pricing of the food
With that said, their food is excellent
There I would never recommend eating at their place instead of the comforts of your own home since the place is bustling with deliveries left and right
They have fantastic customer service as well -- numerous times they've messed up on my order but they immediately requested rush delivery to give me what was missing or what they had messed up on
Their delivery times are quick and their phone manners are exceptional, which is a true rarity nowadays
NOTE: Make sure you have the male waiter answer the phone as he is the most polite and has never messed up my order
I walked in during the peak of rush hour and ordered takeout, got in it less than 10 minutes
Beef brocolli was excellent, and great value- total inc
tax was 6
25 for entree, rice and egg roll
Believe me, this is a bargain when you're used to paying $10 for a mediocre lunch anywhere else in Manhattan
You know the food is fresh even before you order it, because the topnotch staff handles an amazing turnover
The dining room is a bit crowded (which adds to the character) but pleasant decor, much nicer than a typical takeout place
Fresh ingredients, great service, good value- want more could you want? Highly recommend!
I have dined at well over 25 chinese restaurants within New York City and I can honestly say that this place is without a doubt the best I have yet to find
The food is flat OUT OF THIS WORLD and the service and atmosphere is very admirable
You usually will be served within 7-10 minutes after you order depending on the size of your party
I have eaten here somewhere in the neighborhood of 40-50 times and have not once been let down
Not to mention the prices (esp the lunch specials) are an amazing bargain as well
If you are in the mid-town area and looking for some excellent chinese food, then look no further than John's Shanghai
They will take great care of you and I promise, you WILL NOT be disappointed
This place was excelent
I'm not really big on chinese food, but this place really hit the spot
Back in Missouri, you don't get a lot of this good of food
The food was great, the service was great, and the place was really clean and well kept
My husband and I visit this restaurant every year around Christmas
The food is excellent and inexpensive considering the large portions you receive
The service is great without being overbearing however the restuarant's interior could be updated
My wife and I have been coming here for years
We usually come here before going to the theater
They serve a huge portion of skirt steak that is seasoned to perfection
We both like the skirt steak so much that we never ordered anything else! I would strongly recommend giving them a try
I visited when the band Tribe of Djemba was performing and I have to honestly say that this is the best live band that I have seen in a while
Not since Majek Fashek was playing did anyone thrill the audience to such satisfaction
Obviously there have been previous reviews wriiten by gringos who can't dance - I mean that in the nicest way possible
The fact is, if you don't like spanish music (merengue, salsa) or hip hop or reggae, then you need not attend on Friday nites
Plain and simple, this place is fun as hell for a nite of all out dancin' and if you don't have rhythm or are looking for a refined ballroom experience, look elsewhere or pay $1000 for the New Year's Eve parties the are legendary
But if you wanna get your GROOVE on, bring it! P
S
It's not trashy ghetto, hello
come on now, it's just a party with some ethnic people who know how to have a good time! :-p
Ollies in midtown is terrible
The food is average, but the service is awful
The staff is rude and inconsiderate
They dont answer any questions properly and make you feel rushed
I would not recommend this restaurant
There are quite a few ollies in Manhattan and this is by far the worst
The prices are higher and the food is worse
Find another ollies
Ollies is a chain of chinese restauraunts in manhattan
The food portions are nice and the food is tasty but the servers are not the nicest people
Although they are not nice the service is fast and speedy
If you want good food fast, tasty and cheap Ollies is for you
If you want a slow relaxing meal it may not work in your favor
Great place to grab a quick, well priced bite of chinese food before or after a Broadway show
The service isn't great, but the food it good and authentic
Being that I worked in the building next door, Evergreen, aka Everdirt, was always close to my heart
Though i usually only went there on days when it was freezing out or rainy, i was never dissapointed
It was the atmposhere you wanted walking into a midtown diner and the food was decent
When co-workers and I wanted to have a good sit down, Evergreen was the place
i always got the cheeseburger deluxe and my friend swore by the buffalo burger
The chocolate shake was always a staple in my ordering routine and was never let down by its quality
If ever in Rockefeller center and looking for a casual sitdown away from the touristy hoo-rah, Evergreen is the place

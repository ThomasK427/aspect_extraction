Everything was wonderful
The overall gives us all we want for that special moment
We went on saturday March 12/05 at night and we wont forget that moment
Thank you eveyone, thank you Michael
(The waiter)
Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at Fleur de Sel for dinner; the entire experience was flawless
The restaurant itself is beautiful and intelligently designed
We ordered the 6 course menu and were amazed by the food
The foie gras terrine was impeccable and the lobster was a brilliant medley of flavors
The fish and meat courses were equally impressive with a simple elegance that is difficult to find in fine restaurants
The desserts were incredible; their banana mousse was a perfect balance of textures and tastes
Not was the food impressive but also the portions and the value
The wine list was another highlight of the evening; it was extensive and well thought out
The true pleasure of this restaurant was the graciousness and kindness of the service; it is rare to feel so well treated at a restaurant
This restaurant is a true New York City treasure
My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate my birthday, and the bill with tip was FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS! I was absolutely in shock
We love good food and are willing to pay extra for a good meal, but this felt very wrong
It's very hard to enjoy a meal when the price tag is so steep
We ordered the tasting menu ($82 per person), which of course was good, but the portions were so small
I suppose I was naive in thinking we'd spend around $250 or so
Our bottle of wine was $85 and two glasses of champagne in the beginning were $17 each
We've had better, more reasonably priced food and larger portions in many restaurants in Paris
Oh, and the decor and ambiance are not particularly exciting
Don't go here if you are under 30 and have to pay for the meal yourself
I went with a party of four for a business dinner
We had the 6 course tasting menu with wine pairing
Each course was accompanied by a new wine
Both the food and the wines were extraordinary
Very flavorful dishes with excellent wines to match
The service was top notch
I will bring my wife and our daughter for a nice evening next time
I went for my 1 year anniversary and everything was perfect
The service was great and we had the tasting menu, which I reccommend if because it allows you to try more on the menu
the wine list as a lot of good suprise and to tell you we went on monday night and it was 1/2 price on cote du rhone
What a bargain just go go go
I made reservations on relatively short notice for an anniversary dinner - oops
I hadn't heard much about the place but happily discovered the food, service and ambiance exceeded my expectations
We will be back
What an amazing prix fixe lunch! The veal was like silk, with a lovely savory gravy, dessert was divine
My husband had a crepe that trumped every crepe we have ever had in France
Portions were a decent size, vegetarian options are available, service was prompt if not terribly warm
The wine pairings were incredible
If you're visiting NY, this is the place to have a great meal without all the attitude and a month-long wait
The prix fixe lunch is a great value and I will definitely return when I visit NYC again
I ate at fleur de sel the other night and had one of the best meals ever
The service was just great, the foot was awesome, and the wine selection was superb
What more could I ask for? I took a date there She loved it
the decor is so romantic and We are both going back again--together soon
My husband and friends had our christmas gathering last week at this wonderful restaurant
We heard such great things about this wonderful spot
We aren't as knowledgable about wines as we would like but the sommelier was very helpful
We ended up having the 6 courses with wine pairing and it was such a treat
Overpriced and overrated
I've have better French
Group of 4 people shared the prix fixe tasting and it was all so-so except for the dessert
Service was good, but still didn't cover the average food
It is a shame that such great food was compromised by such terrible service
Fleur de Sel lacks a bar/waiting area, so as we waited for our complete party to arrive- we were crammed in the cold doorway along with a half dozen others
When we were seated, we were appalled at how inattentive the service was
Although the meal itself was fantastic, we couldn't enjoy ourselves as a result
The clincher was when the waitress came to take an order of our desert wine
She disappeared mid-order, and then forgot to take our desert-wine order entirely
There's too many restaurants in NYC on par with Fleur de Sel gastronomically- save yourself the money, and go to a place with service that waits on you
It has been a long while since my wife and I have been 'wow' by a restaurant in NYC
Yes there are great restaurants, but there seem to be lack of passion
Fleur de Sel hit the spot
We celebrated with the six course tasting menu
OUTSTANDING! Well thought out journey
their service staff are very elegant and knowledgeable
They treat you very well here!!! Go see for yourself, and try the pork chops
We'd been looking forward to our birthday dinner at Fleur de Sel for 3 weeks and expectations were terribly high
The restaurant itself was incredibly warm and we were there for 4 hours
In the end, we spent just about twice our monthly grocery budget on one meal
The meal, the experience, surpassed our expectations and was totally and completely worth every penny
We indulged in the six course tasting menu with wine pairings
The food itself was excellent and in some cases absolutely inspired
The food in conjunction with the wine pairings was absolute genius
The food bringing out the best in the wine and vice versa
The service was formal and the staff knowledgable, but in no way snooty
By the way, contrary to account in the negative review, this restaurant has no bar
We dined there for our anniversary and every thing was perfect
The food was great, the service was nice and we loved the coziness of the place
We also loved the bread
I would go back as soon as I can with friend
we will not forget this place
There are many famous New York restaurants that are totally overrated, which make foreign visitors say, Americans dont know anything about food
But this place is REAL
It represents the best of New York
Whats impressive about this restaurant is the food, wine and serviceeverything at fleur de sel has a slight edge and precisely controlled: flower arrangements, background music (played in perfect volume), and soon to come the new decor
go and enjoy the tasting and wine pairing the best
Had a wonderful dinner here - my first time - and the food was just out of this world: delicious, with layered subtle flavors that you just had to close your eyes and savor
We did the prixe fixe dinner with wine pairing and it was a sublime experience, as well as being a really decent value
Service is wonderful, friendly yet unobtrusive
Ambience is wonderfully low-key
Will go back again and again!
This was one of my best dining experience in my tens years in New York and dining around the world
Their service is classy and on point
If you go, you must get the tasting menu
It is to die for
I can only say 'run, run', don't walk

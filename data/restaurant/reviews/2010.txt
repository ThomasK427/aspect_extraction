Not much stood out about this place, though, so for the money, I'd prefer to go to another restaurant that dazzles the palate or senses a bit more
The things I liked best were how they didn't try to squeeze a lot of tables into the space, keeping the buzz in the dining room is at a reasonable volume
With the nice silver and formal dining chairs, you do feel a bit luxurious in these surroundings
The desserts were very good, better than the main portion of the meal
The appetizers and entrees were tasty, but I can make them myself at home
I'll probably like this place when I'm a lot oldes, like when I turn 50 or something
But for now, I'll opt for more omph
Chanterelle left me bored and unstimulated and put a dampner on a celebratory occasion
I didn't appreciate feeling like i was in my aunt's dining room when i'd rather feel like i was in a manhattan restaurant
I can't complain about food or service
but for me i like a cheerful atmosphere, somewhere i can have fun
Everything was perfection!! The environment that surrounds you makes you feel so welcome and comfortable
it was like being in someone's dining room
The service was excellent
The staff was very helpful and not the least snobbish with questions regarding either the food or the wine list
My guest and I were there for about 4 hours and did not even realize it
I have not experienced any restaurants like this in NY yet
Food of course was excellent
An entire package!!!
There is no other four star restaurant where they mak ANYONE feel special
No arrogance here
The food is as good as it gets
The ambiance is magic
This restaurant consistently produces great food and has excellent service
Would definitely recommend
THE FOOD IS EXQUISITE!
THATS ALL I NEED TO SAY
DEFINITELY MAKE RESERVATION
I just dined at Daniel last night so now I feel very compelled to rate Chanterelle which I dined a couple of months ago, it's my obligation and my way of saying THANK YOU!  Excellent cuisine, best value, wonderfully knowledgeable staff
The ambience is so romantic, I can't describe it
Something that Daniel lacked so much of
The staff here make you feel welcome and give you personal attention and they value every new client as if he is one of the regulars
Well after a number of years, I decided to revisit this downtown institution
To keep it brief, the food and service was good, as expected
However, I did not see a creative spark in the dishes
Dont get me wrong the quality is there but you pay for that
It would be hard not to have a romantic evening at Chanterelle! The food was excellent, the service was very attentive, friendly, and knowledgable
Certainly one of the classiest restaurants in town
What a great place! In addition to the wonderful food, Chanterelle is beautiful in every sense of the word
If you're looking for a dark room with baby spots over the tables and a noisy and perhaps smoky bar, look elsewhere
David Waltuck and his staff produce nuanced dishes that go beyond the classics upon which they are built without overwhelming the well-chosen ingredients
This restaurant is perhaps New Yorks finest
Coming from a foody, this place is awesome! While it is expensive, I Did the tasting menu and the wine pairing last weekend and it was one of the best meals I had in the city
The service, while not a great as the food was still pretty great
We had to wait a few minutes when we arrived but they were nice and comp'd us cocktails
I love the space! It is just simple elegance
for the cost and the pagaentry i would expect better food
much better food
blah
blech
go elsewhere
Always a fantastic culinary pleasure, Chanterelle leaves us feeling that their are master chefs
Every bite is heaven and the fish is surperb! The wine list is extensive but the serveres know their stuff
The atmosphere is elegant and beautiful
the chanterelle experience manages to be both classy and traditional while still maintaining a hip endge to it
the lovely dining room is rather stark, I'm told so that you can concentrate on the food, which is absolutely to die for
The staff is very good, and the overall experience is nothing sort of what you would expect from one of the best restaurants in manhattan, though it does come at top dollar tabs
We've been heading down to Chanterelle for at least 6 years and it's always a pleasure
The staff is charming, the food is surperb and we leave everytime knowing that we'll be back
The wine list is huge and the fish is fantastic
It's layed back and 5 star at the same time
Birthday wishes at Chaterelle
that's how celebrated my b'day with 11 of my closest family/friends
Excellent service
quietly,the staff is at the ready
cuisine(this is one time where that word fits) is FABULOUS!!
all the flavors blend so well
MANY THANKS!!
deserves a mom indeed
you can get just about anything, including another mom, here at ellen deli
sue is the woman in charge and she takes control
in just one breathe - get my girl some coffee - and there it was
what more can a girl ask for????
This plaice is a good one
You can pretty much get anything you want to from here - IPN is a pure play deli
Start with the potato salad and move quickly to a hot pressed cubano - don't forget the vanilla-roma tiparillo for a delightful after-snak
Be warned though, this plaice gets packed at lunch - and the service can be rottenly slow-going
one of my favorite lunch places in tribeca
delicious sandwiches and soups with fresh herbs and ingredients
a bit on the pricey side but it feels like they put a lot of care into the food
well worth the wait on the lunch line which moves pretty quickly because they have a figured out a system
the cowboy cookies are great -- yummy chunks of chocolate with oatmeal bits
Daily sandwich speacials are great and more inventive than standard soup and sandwich places
Calls to place an order for delivery are often met with a busy phone signal (who knew busy signals still existed?)
When you finally get through, more often than not, you are then placed on hold for another couple of minutes
The food here is awesome - great sandwiches, soups and coffee
I love the menu and the specials - though I hate the lunchtime line going out the door and practically down the street
great sandwiches and salads
one of the best smoked chicken salad sandwiches I've ever had
Yummy bread, tasty soups
but be prepared
the joint is tiny and there is often a line going out the door
The Scene Fresh-picked apples line the loge at the entryway, and their wonderful scent lingers inside
Two vaulted rooms, one an elegant ivory, the other a warmer crimson, offer plush chairs, fresh flowers, and odd--though not necessarily loud--acoustics
The feel is less stuffy than many restaurants of this caliber, but the service is no less polished
The Food Chef David Bouley's strength lies in layering flavors yet always preserving the essence of a dish's centerpiece
Silky black bass with porcini mushrooms carries smoky, earthy and buttery overtones that somehow never overpower the fish, and whole-roasted baby pig includes belly meat, braised for 24 hours in five spice-ginger glaze, and yet the pork flavor is still fully present
A bright, colorful terrine of lobster, mango and artichoke wrapped in Serrano ham and drizzled with a passionfruit, coconut and tamarind dressing, represents the chef at his best
I've heard a lot about this place and I was moderately impressed
Service was good, but nothing special

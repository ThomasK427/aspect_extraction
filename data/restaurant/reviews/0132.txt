One of the best restaurants in the city
Great place for a date or to catch up with an old friend
Food is superb and the service is very attentive
Last night was our second time dining here and we are still amazed with the food
There was a negative review about the chicken which is laughable because we requested the chicken in our tasting menu so that we could experience the remarkable moist softness and flavor of it again
The creativity here is unbelievable
We had shots of chilled soup with drops of infused oil on top as an amazing teaser
He actually puts soup in shot glasses
Then we had a crab lasagna appetizer
A must! To cleanse our palettes, a wine sorbet over soaked peaches
Desserts ~ a berry soup with mint and lemongrass; a plum panacota and a chocolate bread pudding which is perfect, too
All in all, go there
You'll be enjoying a 3 star experience ~ and for a smaller price than Gotham or Grammercy
I came here without much of an appetite and left having eaten more than I imagined, just because the food was so good
In particular, the Crabmeat Lasagne was AMAZING
I recommend Blue Hill to anyone, the service was excellent as well
The food was outstandingly prepared
I had a cod dish that was among the best fish dinners I've had in this city
The presentation was also excellent
The wine list was a bit limited to my taste, and could have been more moderately priced
Service was above average, and they seemed very eager to be sure to please you
I didn't even feel like I was in New York - and if it's nice out, definately sit outside! The food was really fantastic and not too over the top in terms of what they were trying to be
Service was subtle and professional
I had my birthday here and I was really happy wiht my choice
I woudldefinately go back
It was warm and inviting
In Short This 65-seat Creole restaurant opened in 2000, and boasts the twin talents of Richard Lewis (the architect behind Pastis and Commune) and Executive Chef Steven Manning (of New Orleans' highly rated Clancy's)
The casual restaurant and bar serves standards like crawfish etouffee and cornmeal-encrusted fried oysters, as well as turtle soup and "pain perdu" (New Orleans-style French toast) for Sunday brunch
i had a delicious shrimp creole
The chicken dinner was real good
I thikn that the portions were big, which made our two appetizers unnecessary
but the food was delicious
The food tasted like authentic New Orleans style cooking
The service was excellent
This restaurant is a diamond in the rough
I was at Bayou for a 40 person party
They managed to achieve awe inspiring excellent service with a visible staff of 3
The manager Larry and waiter/bartender Brian were the friendliest, accomodating people I've ever met
They kept even the bride calm and enjoying her own party
The food was beyond amazing
Can't wait to go back!
Went last night and can't wait to head back
The staff is the friendliest staff you will meet in NY and the food is AMAZING! Try the frozen lemon pie for dessert - you won't be disapointed
Never had the pleasure of making love with a sensous Creole? I Gar-run-tea you'll know wha it's like after dining at Bayou
Turtle Soup w/ Sherry to intoxicate your palate, Cornmeal Fried Oysters to stimulate your sexual appetite, Shrimp Creole seducing you into passionate abandon
Bourbon Whiskey Bread pudding will have you basking in a dreamy afterglow
You'll gently be brought back to the real world with an delicious cup of Espresso
If your ready for a serious affair, you must visit, Bayou
We split two of appetizers - a salad and a delicious chicken liver sautee with a wine butter sauce
The portion was generous and perfectly tender
Of the entrees, the winner was the snapper with a vanilla butter lemon sauce (with pecans)
Frozen lemon pie --my sister said that alone was worth the trip
We went on Friday evening
The tables weren't packed too tightly
Service was attentive, checking on us with each course
I asked about the sauces and the waiter told me a couple of the flavors I couldn't quite pinpoint
Every time we said thank you, they said You're welcome, - a common courtesy that isn't so common
A very nice evening - best I've had in a while
The Scene An amalgam of after-work diners, neighborhood regulars and tourists from local hotels converge beneath the whir of Montparnasse's ceiling fans
The space is traditional in feel
Decorative elements include a bright red awning, retro French posters and black-and-white photographs set against yellow walls
The Food Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu
The kitchen finds success with classics like a homemade, cognac-rich duck terrine and well-seasoned steak frites (although the fries tend to be heavily salted)
Montparnasse's desserts--especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart--are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason
The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service
In addition, the food is very good and the prices are reasonable
If you go for the pre-theatre menu, it's an even greater deal
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine
Everytime I'm in town I make sure I pass by this lovely french restaurant that has an authentic look and that surves devine food
Not to dressy, not to casual, a great wine list if you want to have a romantic diner before the theater and unique drinks for an afterwork relaxing experience plus the staff is super friendly, what more to ask?
It was very tasteful and the portions were perfect
I didn't leave overly stuffed
Based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM
I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ($19
95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvelous
When we arrived at 6:00 PM, the restaurant was practically empty
When we left at 8:00 PM, it was packed and noisy
So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise
So if you want a nice, enjoyable meal at Montparnasse, go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe
Bon appettite!!
We had problems with the check too! I've walked by this place after going to Divine Bar before (go there intsead), and always thought it looked nice
Well, the food is fine, but not spectacular
The wines are decently priced
The tableside service is adequate, if slow
At least there's no music blaring like in so many places
But they charged us three times for the bill because they FORGOT TO PUT PAPER IN THE MACHINE! So my boyfriend's card got frozen, all because these guys took thirty minutes and a second credit card to figure out that they didn't have paper in the check printer
It wasn't the perfect end to an imperfect evening
The food was decant
There so many good french bistro in NYC, i dont know why anyones would go eat there unless you look to get angry at an untrained staffs, the restaurant was full, it took 2 hours to get served, lots of tables around us left angry because the service was so slow, the manager in the meantime was acting as an host and couldnt have care less as what was happening in his dining room
On the top of everything at the end of the dinner the waiter gave us the wrong check
I would not recommended this restaurant to anyones
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try
We were less than impressed
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better
We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone
Probably would not go again
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way, the food was insultingly horrible
We ordered the steak/frites, with 'medium' for our beef
What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy

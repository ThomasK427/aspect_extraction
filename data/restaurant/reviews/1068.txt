But the value here isn't
Small, but tasty, portions predominate, with a simple sandwich and soft drink bill costing -- with tax and tip -- about $20
Budget dining it's not
But perhaps it's the view that's most attractive
The Scene This dimly lit two-story space reinterprets old-school Chinese restaurants for a hipster clientele
Back-lit food photos over the wok-flaring open kitchen are abstract; unlimited duck sauce is homemade; the early '80s tunes fuel an feel-good mood
Easygoing servers deliver steaming platters and flaming desserts to crowds squeezed into deeply cushioned banquettes framed by ornate wood carvings
The Food Owner Frank Prisanzano, beloved for Little Frankies', Supper, et al, tackles the kind of American-Chinese menu diners can recite in their sleep
Dishes like crisp-fried, sauce-laden General Tso's chicken with steamed broccoli, and curry-laced Singapore chow fun with mild roast pork aim to mimic corner Chinese spots
Others, like glazed, meaty spare ribs and seafood-stuffed eggplant, are successful innovations
But some of the renewed classics, like Peking duck wrapped in tortillas with cucumber, and ho-hum egg rolls stuffed with crunchy vegetables, lack the unctuous pleasure of the originals
On a Wednesday night, a friend and I were wandering around, trying to find a place where we could sit and talk (and drink!) and he was really excited when he saw China1
Apparently, he had been there before and loved it
Inside, there was a main room, seemed like it was used primarily for dining
It was lit with multi-colored chinese lanterns and looked funky and fun
After taking a set of stairs, we descended upon a huge room with a big screen TV (playing Spinal Tap!) and a bar, also lit with Chinese Lanterns
Again, very cool
But the coolest part of the entire night was the other room we found, down a hallway from the big TV room
It was a very comfortable, seductive, plush (but not in a VIP room kind of way), and very dimly lit by candles
The walls were lined with comfortable couches with beautifully embroidered pillows and there was even a fishtank with the biggest goldfish I have ever seen
Recessed into the walls were these very intimate rooms for small groups, again filled with comfortable couches and draped in sheer fabrics
Very Cool
There was also live music, and they stayed open until quite late on a Wednesday night
I didn't eat the food, but I can't wait to go back and try it!
I was out in the east village on monday night with a couple friends and walked by china1, which looked just like a small restaurant, but it had a security guard outside
Turns out there was a Rock party in the downstairs lounge, free to get in
The place is pretty big, and there was a good size tatooed crowd, with a selection of village hotties and free Bud and Vodka drinks
The dj played a very decent rock set and then we spotted Naima from America's Next Top Model there with her twin sister
Needless to say, we're going back
the place is incredibly chill
Didn't try the food but asked around and only heard good things
Monday night one of my friends hosted a rock party at China1, It turns out its a pretty sick space, and the party was dope
The vibe really good
A bunch of girls from burningangel were there running around in their schivies, Jimmy Gustavo from Murphy's Law was there with his boys from New York Hardcore Tattoos
I heard they're gonna start doing tats there soon! There was an open bar for about an hour and the music rocked
Consider me a regular at this party for sure
I live in the area and came was startled by the unique quality of China 1
We had dinner in their cellar-like dining area, which you arrive at after passing through several chambers and warmly lit staircases
The moment we entered the downstairs dining area, I said, I'm throwing my next birthday here, this is amazing! They have a dj, a bar, and full service of the best chinese food you will ever try
Not to mention, hot little private rooms filled with cushions and curtains for intimate gatherings
The whole feel of the place is edgey, seductive, warm, and very cool
I've since been back to spend the night at their main bar which is decked out in old country chinese artifacts, tapestries, and deep cherry woods
The scene is to die for, plenty of dimly lit corners to recline in, beautiful people to watch, witty and friendly staff, and a prime location for anyone looking for a great night out! I highly reccomend spending more than a few hours in this beautiful space!
I love Chinese food and have been looking for the alternative to the greasy stuff on every corner of New York- ya, you know, the stinky take-out joints that leave you smelling like dinner for 100 for the rest of the night! Well, that's not China 1 at all you never leave smelling like a chinese restaurant and the the food is so good! It is healthy and not greasy at all- So anyways they serve food until 3AM now on Friday and Saturday's and I was leaving a club last weekend and stopped in for another drink and to my suprise could still order food! I had a DRUNKEN EGGROLL around 2 am- it was huge! the perfect food for soaking up that liquor! I reccomend this place!
As a vegetarian Chinese food has not been my first choice, but last night my friends took me out to China 1 where the waiter told me that I can have whatever I want on the menu done Vegetarian
So I tried the General Tsos Tofu and it was the bomb! They can make almost any dish you want so you are not limited to the standard vegetarian choices
Service was laid back, but good
I left China 1 with a very balanced Chi
People you better take advantage of this place no door charge and no red rope attitude, you feel like you just walked on to a film set in China
Here is a space in the city that has one of the coolest vibes and best dcor great for parties, my friend had a party there last weekend and it was rockin, the DJs were cool, the crowd was mixed and the Lychee and pomegranate sake martinis are unbeatable!
I had the best time in a long time out on a weekend night, this is the place to be if you like a crowd that is interesting yet unpretentious, a place where you could really chill and mingle without feeling like a peacock with its feathers ruffled
Note to Singles- these are people you actually want to meet!
Finally the East Village is mixing it up
This is the place for good food, good drink and good eye candy that doesn't host the homogenous and predictable types that frequent the big name clubs
The lounge is well lit and the music is just right so you can groove and talk or just chill on a sofa in a dark corner
The food here was great when they first opened, but now they've gone through multiple menu changes, each time it gets worse and worse (chinese food with no soups????
And with the ever more terrible menu, they keep jacking up the prices
Was once my fav place to eat, but now I'll never go back again until its under new management
This is a great place to party with your friends, sexy laid back ambiance
Killer lychee martinis
China 1 or Number 1 chinese was a really fun place
Great spot that hasnt exploded so much that they have an annoying door or are obnoxious
Friendly staff, fun atmosphere to party at minus the usual pretentiousness that overwhelms this great city
food was enjoyable and music was fresh
I'd go back
This place seems like a really hip place to be on a Saturday night
The bartenders were hot, the vibes were chill, and the food was pretty good
I ate there with a bunch of buddies and ended up staying most of the night
The DJ's were on point also
Overall, it was a great spot to stumble upon in the Up and Coming East Village
I went here on recomendation of a trusted food-maven hommie of mine and, boy, was the kid on the ball
The restaurant has a neat upstairs bar and seating area-reminiscent of traditional Sichuan wood-works
To start, the dim sum was outrageous
The calamari was stir fried to perfection, the shu-mai were tender and the stuffed japanese eggplant is just so unique to this place that I can barely describe it! For dinner we split sesame chicken, short ribs, a whole freakin' snapper, an asian ceasar salad(!), and peking duck wraps
We mangaged to chase the delicious food with a short glass of apple wine on the waiter's reccomendation
domo arigato! To top the evening off we venture downstairs to find a DJ blasting off tunes in their opium den-like lounge with many sexy folks getting their NYC on
China1, as it is called now, is a king amongst dives
peace
food was bland and uninventive, but it was the service that was really tasteless
bill comes to $32
i hand the guy $40 and sit waiting for change
wait some more
keep waiting
guy finally comes over and asks if i'm good or if i want something back
i say, yeah, couple of bucks
guy says, are you sure?! i'm confused
maybe i read the check wrong
i ask to see the check again
nope
$32
so, i say again, yeah, $2, please
guy says, really?! i insist that, yes, despite the fact that he never brought the tea i ordered, i would be leaving what i thought was a good tip (19% on the post-tax total; a whopping 31% on the pre-tax total), whereupon he hands me $2 and walks away shaking his head, leaving me wondering why i should ever come here again
Ordered in some food
Waited an hour
Delivery guy shows up
Food was $15 and I only had a $20
He said he had no change and got hostile when I asked for some
Frightening experience for a woman when a large man is yelling in an unknown language in my hallway
Dumplings were overcooked and soggy
Ate there a month ago and food was also terrible at restaurant

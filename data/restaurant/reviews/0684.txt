The food was marginal at best
The four of us order an appetizer to share
It took some time for the appetizer to arrive
When we were just half done the appetizer, the waiter asked if we wanted our main course, which we did not
When our meals arrived, some were lukewarm, my lamb was well done (I requested medium-rare)
We decided to finish the dinner, be off, and not to return
After I paid the bill, the waiter confronted me for only leaving a 10% tip
He stated that I was to tip a minimum of 15% to 20% in NYC and handed me the bill back
I told him I did not appreciate warmed over food and that I did make a mistake by leaving a tip
Obviously, I would stay clear of this second-rate restaurant that employs poorly manned waiters
Every year around the holidays I take my mom to a show and dinner
This year my 7 yr old daughter joined us
I picked Cascina, because my friend recommended it to me
We had such a great time, I have to recommend it to all of you
The decor is magnificent
The food was delicious
My daughter and I shared a pizza margarita; one of the best pizzas I had ever had
My mom, a pasta fanatic, had fettocine and absolutly loved it
The staff was so nice, they accomodated us without any problems, even gave my daughter paper and pens to play with
(a rarity in the city these days) We had such a wonderful time
My daughter asks me everyday to go to the best pizza house with the red walls
The restaurant has red walls
I highly rocommend it
We will certainly be back
Love the pizza, you have to try it for yourself
It comes out of their brick over right in the middle of the restaurant and it's the best I ever had
My husband and I work in the area and go there to unwind
The place is beautiful, cozy, romantic and a departure from the busy New York scene
I feel transported to an italian vinyard
They make their own wine, which is delicious
The homemade tiramisu is another reason we keep on coming back
They have great party rooms upstrais
We had a holiday party there last week, it's great
The service could improve a little, but still it's a great place serving the best pizza
I eard from friends that this restaurant make's the greatest pizza of the hood
\ me and my boyfriend got in late,nobody was a the door so we set on our own on the window table
the waiter come 's along and look's at his watch saying: yes kitchen is closing in 10 minutes! No good evening , nothing
We rush to order drinks,and i look at my watch and see 10:45 pm
? the door sign doesn't say 11:00pm close?! anyway we order the pizza's and i'm sorry but, was very disappointing
It looks like that they were doing us a favor to serve us so late
They must doing so well in business that they can afford to don't take late diners in
okwell, not for me anyway
My husband and I were looking for a cosy romantic neighborhood place on Monday, which was my birthday
Having passed by Cascina on many walks, this time we decided to give it a try
I had recently read about its great pizza and homemade wine
We skipped the pizza, headed straight for the homemade pasta and wine, and WOW was I impressed
For a mere 7 dollars, you get a truly delicious glass of red, which comes straight from their vineyards in Italy
The service was thoughtful, generous (for the special occasion at hand) and wonderfully attentive without being overbearing
Though some decor is over the top, it has great ambient lighting and lots of spots for a romantic meal- you won't feel like you are on top of your neighbor
Cascina is a place I will certainly go back to again and again! *Highly recommended*
This place was awesome
The food was some of the best I have ever had
The wait staff was promt, polite, friendly, etc
The food was not at all expensive, they have a full bar, and you can sit outside or inside
I would recommended this place to ANYONE
Though very accomodating (we had to change our party size and time quite a few times), this restaurant did not impress
Service - Once there, the service left a lot to be desired
Our waiter took our order and never came back
Second, I was beginning to get parched from waiting for my water to be refilled
Plus, our table was filled with crumbs that were never even looked at
Food - more bad news! Though I've never had it, my friends assured me that their lasagne tasted exactly like the famous Chef Boyardee's
Their risotto - very mushy
However, there were some bright spots: the calamari with their spicy sauce - very yummy; their homemade pasta with duck ragout - tasty; and the homemade tiramisu - one of the best I've ever had
My recommendation: you can do better elsewhere - though, not for the tiramisu
Went to a show with the family, and I knew this place was recommended, so I reserved it
Being the skeptical type though, I was a little worried
All I can say is Cascina exceeded all of our expectations
Our waitress Angela was attentive and made sure we got everything we asked for on a busy night
Busboys constantly filling our water
The manager (Pippo) asked how everything was
My daughter and I tried the cannelloni stuffed with veal and ricotta, and it was delicious
My wife had the veal scaloppini and loved it, my other daughter had the chicken roll stuffed with spinach, mozzarella and prosciutto, and loved it
Their homemade wine was excellent
No room for dessert, but what we saw looked very appealing
Here's the kicker
We got $20 off (10% coupon)our bill of $208
It was gladly accepted, and even returned to us for future use!
The Scene This lively trattoria takes a cue from its charismatic owner--a Roman named Carmine so dedicated to his newest venture (he also owns Tiadora on the east side) that he's been known to smuggle raw milk cheeses back from Italy in his luggage
In this tiny space, Carmine bustles about, glad-handing and challenging you to find a better neighborhood restaurant at similar prices
You'd be hard-pressed to
The Food Pizzas are Neapolitan-style--thin, made with San Marzano tomatoes in a 700-degree wood-burning oven, and loaded with Mediterranean goodies
The ricotta di bufala--a rectangle of fried buffalo ricotta cheese--would be better piping hot, but tasty pastas--a simple vermicelli alle vongole among them--compensate
Non-Italian items like salmon, pancakes and French toast are available at brunch
The food here is delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable
Despite the tiny size of the space the waits are not terrible- your meal here will be relatively quick even if you are having courses as this little spot is in high demand- so don't expect to have a long and leisurely meal
Despite this, Celeste is a lovely place to have an inexpensive, high quality meal, and even though you are likely to be inches away from the nearest table, a little wine and some candlelight makes for a romantic (though quick) meal
You MUST try a cheese plate after dinner- the owner is passionate and extremely knowledgeable about cheese and will explain the plate as well as the processes by which they are made- YUM
Just a word of warning: never go to this restaurant unless you enjoy wasting your money, being treated poorly and being rushed out
The food was quite good and the wait staff was courteous but alas the owner is scrooge incarnate (and a chauvinist to boot)
The owner was rude to us from the moment we sat down until he told us we had to leave because he had another table waiting, and this despite ordering the pricier entrees from the menu and a bottle of wine that we hadn't yet finished
Appalling
Went here with a buddy after hearing some very nice things glad we did
The service was prompt and friendly
The food was served fresh and in a timely manner
Everything we tasted was excellent
No room for dessert but there's always next time
Went to this based on the reviews here
Really not worth it
The food was mediocre at best (mushy pasta, and is it me or are the sauses canned), the staff was rude
Ruined an otherwise nice evening with friends

:) Their sake is also QUITE tasty
maybe one day I will try something else on the menu
nah
:)
I absolutely love this place
and so do all my friends I have taken there
The atmosphere is cosy and relaxed, the service is fantastic (very friendly, polite, and fast), the prices are very good (about $15-20 a person) and the food is delicious! I love sushi so I've been to LOTS in NYC and even on the west coast- where sushi is even more popular than here- and I have to admit that this is the cream of the crop
Don't miss it!
I eat at Shima periodically, and it usually is a pleasant experience
Yesterday I was in a bit of a hurry, so I decided to take out
I ended up waiting on my feet in the restaurant for 30 minutes waiting for a simple sushi deluxe to take out! People who came in after me walked out with their orders before I did
The person who helped me obviously knew I was upset about this and did nothing to update me or try to reassure my order was being taken care of
Whether or not they were short staffed is irrelevant, because they're customer service that day was horrible, and I wouldn't return to treated the way I was
In Short This convivial, unprepossessing Italian seafood joint, signalled by a giant neon fish, attracts a faithful following from outside the city as well as within
Sidewalk seating and a skylit back room add a bit of charm
Specialties of the house include black linguine with shrimp, asparagus, and Pernod; and broiled sea bass with capers, fennel, and tomatoes
A few vegetarian, chicken, and veal dishes are offered for fish-phobes
Overcrowding can result in dilatory service, but loyalists say it's worth it
delicious food, great ambiance, good staff, clean bathrooms
annoying that it's a cash or amex only, but otherwise it's good value
we always have a special
and it's always worth it
seafood lasagna is great, fusilli with smoked salmon and spinach is fabulous
lobster bisque is fantastic, and the grilled seafood salad is a huge plate of goodness
the wait staff aren't super friendly -- depending on the hours you go their attention seems to be elsewhere
however, ask their opinions on what to order and you won't be sorry
Located on E'4th near 2nd ave, hard to find lil place, walk down the steps and enter a lil Italy type of restaurant
Best get there before 6pm when a prixe fix menu tops out at about 13$ for dinner with soup/salad and wine
not bad at all! food isnt superb but for an early bird, very good
i would not go after the early bird b/c its not worth it, find better food for full prices
place takes CASH only or Amex so be prepared
major downside is they are known for their free mussels before 6pm but each time i go they are never ready until after the early bird is over
service is also often slow and annoying
nice decor though, dark and candlelit type of place, again, best go before 6pm, or go elsewhere!
I've eaten here constantly over the last ten years and have watched this place decline
This past weekend's trip was the last
O
K
food, awful tiramisu, a snobby host and hostess and sub-par service! Maybe they changed owners, managers, chefs or all of the above
It does not matterspend your money elsewhere!
Couple friends went for a get together here, the service was ok, the food came, but the food isn't all that great, I had better
The food was not impressive
It looked and tasted like something I would make for myself in a hurry after work
and I don't even like to cook! The salad was just a bag of lettuce they must have picked up at Key Foods with a few chick peas thrown in
It was really crappy
There are much much better places to go to
I love this place, especially when we eat on the outside back terrace
The vegetable and seafood pastas are great, and I find the service very attentive
The manager seems to remember me whenever I go back, even when it's been several months
Once my brother didn't like the lasagna, but I've liked everything there
When I feel like I have to pick up a tab for a group of people, this is the place to go because you won't max out your AmEx (which, incidentally, is the only card they take)
Con is its Cash only
And you are not told this upfront
who has cash only today?? But ambience was great for couples
i brought a platonic friend and felt odd because it seemed more of a romantic spot
Food was very good, and their specials are unbeatable for NYC! includes a house wine which i'd recommend
a little hard to find, so be sure u know where u r going
its kinda not near too many other things
Great ambience, intimate/crowded but you can have private conversations; lively
Excellent, friendly service, great food and great prices
I have been to Cucina several times and try to get there every time I'm in NYC
It has such NY mood, if that's what' you're looking for, and everyone I go there with always says their dinner was delicious
Best Pinot Grigio I've had! Good rating in Zagat's
Go!
My worst dining experience in years ! Horrendous food, poor service, and a terrible night waiting for my stomach to forget the seafood
They offer free mussels at the bar
That sounds cool, until you taste them and find out they're not fresh!!! After a couple of mediocre appetizers (mushrooms and clams both stuffed with lots of bread crumbs) we decided to order the simplest entrees on the menu
These guys screwed up such simple things as Linguine alla Puttanesca
We decided to have a desert somewhere else
They also have the most boring wine list I've ever seen in a restaurant for a long time
The service is inexistent: I heard a waiter in the kitchen explain to another one that when he takes a plate he has to say You have finished _please_
The kind of place that makes you wish you had the money to open a restaurant yourself
this place used to be great, but it seems as though the owners have stopped paying attention, or maybe there are new owners in the last few years? Its just very mediocre now
I wouldn't bother going here, when there are now so many other great places in the neighborhood
I love walking out of a place thinking I got a great deal
Descent food for the price
Dinner for two with 2 apps, dessert, and entree, and drinks came out to $65
00
tHIS PLACE IS A GREAT PLACE, I HAVE BEEN THERE SEVERAL TIMES
ITS HARD TO FIND A GOOD ITALIAN RESTAURANT (BEING THAT IM ITALIAN) THAT ITS BETTER THAN HOME COOKING, FOR SUCH A GREAT PRICE -- DEFINATELY RECCOMEND TO ANYONE (THE COMPLIMENTARY MUSSELS ARE GOOD TOO!)
Great food in a cozy atmosphere
I have eaten here 5 times and it has been great!
I go to cucina's a lot
Yes, there are other italian places where the food is better
Yet cucina's does offer good food, good location, great prices
The service is quick and all the times I've been there I've not had a bad experience
It's one of the best, cheap, fun places to enjoy meal
Yes it's noisy, but it doesn't bother me
That's another reason I enjoy going to cucina
You can bring friends and totally relax and enjoy loud lively conseration and not feel restricted
So if you're looking for a quiet romantic spot, this is not the place
I loved it!!! Great food, good service
You have to get there early for the prixe fixe
I've lived in the neighborhood for a year now and couldn't even count how many times I've been to Cucina
The food is consistently delicious, the service is friendly and attentive, the ambience is cozy yet lively, and the prices are ridiculously reasonable
It's great for couples or groups
I just love this place
From the food to the prices to the ambience
it's great
The only complaint I have is that it doesn't accept any credit cards

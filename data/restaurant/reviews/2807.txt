We felt like we had to go out of our way just to get her attention, even though it wasnt a very busy night
But nonetheless, I will definitely come back and can't wait to try their other menu
Moved to FH about 2 months ago, tried couple Sushi places in the area and was not impressed till I found Narita
Great portion and very reasonable price
The restaurant is clean and beatiful, the waitstaff is very friendly and helpful
I love the sake selection
Try a cup of chilled Kurasawa with your sushi
Also, the hibachi fried rice is out of this world
Banzai Narita !!!!
This elegant restaurant excels at sushi and sashimi
treat to combine good Japanese food with first-rate sake choices
Never a bad experience in Narita, for over 20 years that I have dined there
Great appetizers and sushi choices, the wait staffs are friendly once you become a regular
Since this place is always pack, I strongly recommend reservation on weekend
came here for a bday party, spent 10 minutes waiting for the menu until i was forced to wave a waiter down
when the food finally came, the portions were sufficient and sushi was fresh
only thing was, that it wasnt a busy night! next time ill order my food in advance!
went to Narita last night for my gf's birthday, and we had habtchi
Spend $100, which is not bad consider what we ordered
We both had habtchi, a bottle of plum wine, and 3 appetizer, the food was great, and I really didnt find the wait to be that long like some the other review said
But the appetizer is a litlle pricey, especialy $6 for 3 pieces sushi, but iutside that it was a great experience, food was great, and not too costly over all
I have been dining at Narita for 6 years and have thoroughly enjoyed every meal
The sushi is always fresh and tasty
The wait staff is friendly and helpful and kudos to the sushi chef Hero who serves up great dishes on and off the menu and is always wearing a smile
The prices are very reasonable and youll agree that is money well spent
A superb experience
I'm new to forest hills and I discovered Narita one day shopping at Loft on austin street
This restaurant by far offered the best value for your money
The place is clean and neat, the servers are friendly but a bit slow
The sushi are GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!! Try their amazing roll and broken heart roll and apple martini(so far it out beat city restaurants and bars
) Dont bother with other restaurants in forest hills(they all Queens quality/style), but Narita makes me happy to live in forest hills
Narita is by far, one of the better Japanese restaurants I've been to in NY
The prices are great and the ingredients are the freshest
Their sushi selection is quite large and very interesting as well as their drinks
Try a Sakura when you go
Friends who live in F
H
took us here for dinner on Sat
night and we were pleasantly surprised
The avocado is the sushi was perfectly ripe and creamy and the Tokyo Colado was a fun fruity concoction
The fried hibatchi rice was great
Other than making the grill flame at the beginning our hibatchi chef didnt put on much of a show - no flipping stuff into is hat or our plates - so if that is your thing go to Benihani
The veggies were fresh and well seasoned and the shrimp was outstanding
Many of Japanese Restrants in Manhattan are overpriced
However, Narita's sushi is very reasonable
The Fish, we Japanese calls it NETA are from same market as some very famous resautrants in NY, but price is much more resonable, per sushi shef, which we agree
If you spend $25 per person at so-unreal sushi bar or spend $60 per person on somewhat real sushi restaurant in manhattan, just visit Narita and spend $40 and eat very nice NETA, unless you go so authentic to have money to spend $150 per person hahaha
The sushi at Narita is the best I have ever had
It is always fresh, tasty and deliciously presented
Though it might be a wait and the service might leave a little to be desired, anyone that has ever eaten there agrees that the food is worth it
Whether it is hibatchi or Sushi
this is the place to go!!
Great food, good service
But you must be willing to wait most evenings at peak dining times
It is a very attractive place ot dine
I was excited about trying this restaurant because I heard so many good things about
The ambience is nice and I like the fact that they stay open late
I don't what happened with the service the night I decided to try
They took so long with the food my cousin told them if we don't get our food in 2 minutes we were leaving
So we got our food then
It was good with hugh portions
The waiter was very nice and it wasn't his fault
They definitely need to do something about the kitchen because it is very slow
Came to eat at this restaurant with some friends from out of town
The restaurant was conserving costs that day I guess- They had the front windows open and refused to turn the air conditioner on
They could not accomodate any requests- like ice water
The waitress was slow and had to ask the kitchen first every time we asked her about anything on the menu
Our food took so long that we actually seriously contemplated walking out
After we tasted it, we regretted staying
My friend order a cuban sandwich that came with one slice of pickle
When he asked for more, the waitress had to ask the kitchen first, and then came back and said the pickles were pre- apportioned to each plate of sandwiches! No extra pickles, no AC, no ice water, slow service, the whole thing was just dissapointing
And the bill was outrageous
This was overall a good experience rivals some of the best restarant in Manhattan the service is was outstanding
This place definitely serves good food, and the place is small but romantic
It's a little pricey but it's good to go once in a while
The only down side is the long wait
There's always an hour to hour and a half wait for a table, and they don't take reservations
This was a very nice place
When I first walked in, I was wowed by the dim lights, and romantic settings
The food was delicious
It was a little on the pricy side, but it was well worth it for first dates or any events
The food is excellent here
And the portions, for the most part, are so big - you'll have enough for lunch the next day
I highly reccomend the Ropa Vieja
Though not TOO much for vegetarians, they'll find something
Like the other reviewer said, have a Mojito and enjoy the sugarcane
They are *shockingly* under $7 a piece
Growing up in Texas I came to expect good Latino food, but once I moved away it's not as available anymore
However, Cabana has been a great find in New York
There's usually a big crowd, but it's worth the wait
It's a fun atmosphere and great food
Try the Bocadillos to start and don't forget to order a Mojito from the bar (they're the best!)
Service was good except the waitress brought over the check before I asked her
Coconut shrimp, fried cod fish appetizers were good something I would order again, my steak was so-so, prolly order something different next time
I'd go there again and would recommend it to people who want spanish food from forest hills
I've been to Cabana three times and have never been disappointed
The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is lively and fun
If you like latin food in a classy, fun atmosphere, this is the place for you
The food is ok, but not worth the prices
I found a few things to be way too salty

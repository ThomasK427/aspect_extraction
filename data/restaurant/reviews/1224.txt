Admittedly, the service, overall, isn't the best I've ever encountered, but if you want good food and then want to be left alone with it (like my husband and I do), this is a great place to go
The restaurant is unpretentious and airy, and we always come away happy (and without empty wallets)
I went with some friends
We had a really good time
We ate well, we drank well
All in all, it was a very positive experience
We will go back
Definately
Good food, reasonable prices
It's not easy to come by
Given all the disparate reviews of this place I decided to check it out ourself, and unfortunately I am going to side with those who are saying it was bad
I hate giving bad reviews of places but this place is off my list
The service was painfully slow and the food that was delivered was passable, but definately not worth the price
Since there were raves about the pizza we opted for the margherita and aside from the soggy crust I guess it was ok
It seems to me that there is some review rigging here as the last 2 reviews are almost identical
I would say try it out for yourself, but be prepared to be disappointed
I like the politeness at Peperoncino, i sensed they love the food they serve, and how fresh all the ingredients are! The decor is welcoming, a down to earth that isn't sloppy but peaceful
The pizza must be tried by anyone seriously proud of NY's pizza
Even the block where the restaurant is located is charming, not too many cars and kids playing
Go for it, i say, and try the different dishes each time
We went for brunch cocktails and sat right through dinner! What a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon
The food was awesome! We started with the pizza margherita (my favorite) fried calamari appetizer, ended up with mouth-watering pasta, the fettucine al cartoccio (a must) lemon mango scallops (yummilicious)!! Nothing like sipping an espresso European-style, for hours, while watching street life take shape along 5th Ave
You know where to find me on Sundays from now on!
Want to eat well in an awesome space with cool people? Then come here! We went last Sunday for brunch cocktails, ate drank our way to dinner! The fettucine al cartoccio were to die for
The pizzas are mouth-watering
Excellent neighbourhood hang out spot!! Will definately go back
If you haven't been here yet, GO!!! This place is unbelievable! I don't know WHAT the heck some of the other reviewers are taking about
the food was awesome, the people were hip fun, and the service was cordial and friendly
You guys are too good to be true
Plus, I got to see Cate Blanchett in person!
If you want to be looked down upon and eat food on par with the olive garden this place is for you
Waitstaff has attitude that definately doesn't belong in Park Slope and serves up pastas that are overcooked and underseasoned
The tagletelle special was a lumpy pile of soggy pasta in a tepid sauce
Overpriced wines by the glass and pizza no better than you can get out of the frozen food isle at costco
Save your money and eat some other place
The other reviews were correct, I should have listened before dropping our money on the tab
be warned
A group of friends brought me here for dinner 2 nights ago
Excellent choice! Although it was my first time (my friends have become regulars), it definately won't be my last
There was an Italian couple in our party, just in from Rome, who couldn't stop raving at the authenticity of the pasta dishes
We shared countless appetizers and pizzas, we each ordered an entree
I fell in love with the tortelli bolognese and panna cotta dessert
The grapes covered in goat cheese encrusted with pistachios has got to be the most heavenly combination my mouth has ever tasted! The music selection provided the perfect ambience, the owner kept the place opened until 1:30, unitl we finished the last of our numerous bottles of wine champagne
I'M GOING BACK NEXT WEEK!!
If you want condescending lectures on how they do things in Italy then this sub par crud shack if for you
Among other things, they had the nerve to complained that one of the 10 people in our party only order salad when the rest of us order appetizers, entrees, and wine
What?!?! This place needs to spend less time wagging its finger at its clientele and more time figuring why their food is bland, cold, and pathetic
This is Brooklyn and they are far to many excellent restaurants to waste you time or money on these pretentious jerks
Seriously, the Pizza Hut at Target has better pizza, ambiance, and service
I 've been coming here for my favorite pizzas a little over a year now, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to try the other items on the menu
The variety and quality of fresh pasta dishes are unique and delicious
All arrive at the table with a mouth-watering aroma, in rustic terra-cotta dishes evoking an old farmhouse feeling
The wine list is so extensive, you can always pair a different one with your meal
Just the other night I felt compelled to betray my need for carbohydrates, enticed by the evening special - braised meat in a mandarin coffee sauce
YUMMY!!!! I highly recommend this to all carnivours! I can't wait to see what next week's special will be
Don't forget to save room for dessert - the homemade pineapple torte was heavenly!
I have travelled all over Italy
This is the closest to neapolitan food I can get in NYC
The homemade pastas are great
I had the duck ravioli
exquisite
The entrees were prepared with such finesse and tasted great
Fish dishes are very fresh
The pizza can be compared to the pizza made in Naples, Italy
I highly reccomend it
I was invited by another couple to dine here and after reading the reviews here I dreaded it, but tried to go into the experience with an open mind
Unfortunatley for me, this place was horrible as people described

The food as other mentioned either had zero salt, or too much salt -- it varied from dish to dish
The waitress had zero knowledge about wine, and even knowledge about the dishes they were serving
If that wasn't bad enough, they are charging a kings ransom for cafeteria quality food
As another reviewer mentioned, there are much better places that you can get a MUCH better meal at a cheaper price
If anyone who works there is reading this, I would suggest a rennovation
Peperoncino was recommended to me by a friend
Finding this place was such a welcome treat
The owners are as authentic and skilled in Italian dining as ever I've experienced, a credible endorsement since I live in Europe and spend considerable time in Italy
The ricotta e spinaci pizza is my favorite, well maybe the quattro formaggi, ohhh and the gran fiore rucola salad is truly divine
I went for the first time with a group of international friends and the atmosphere was appealing and the food delectable
We weren't disappointed
The joy from eating the tiramisu even counterbalanced the calorie-splurge
My boyfriend, a rather exacting diner, actually wondered if we could convince them to open a restaurant in Prague
Please, please!
I don't know why this place got bad reviews - This place is fun, hip and the menu has so much to choose from the only issue I have is not being able to decide what to have! I had the salmon ravoli - it was delicious - the pizza is great - but the pasta is yummy and they give you a lot of it
The owners are great and make you feel at home - no to mention they are always ready to make you a signature drink! Maybe the reviewers that gave them a bad review were having a bad day
yummy
Everything was worderful from the best tasting brick oven pizza to the beautiful decor
One of most exciting nights out in while, feels like your in Naples Italy, and the food could not have been better
I highly recommend it for some of the most authentic italian food around and definitly the best brick oven pizza this side of the Atlantic,
I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!
The food was awesome, the ambiance is cozy and intimate, the tiramisu I had was great and even the coffee was delicious!
You should also try the pizza, between the chef and the brick oven, the pizza is one of the best in town!
It made me feel like I was in Italy again!!!
I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone
The service was less than average, the waiter had very little knowledge about the menu or how the food was prepared
Our appetizers were served with our main course because the waiter forgot to order them
All of our food was either overcooked or undercooked, and the owner/manager was the least apologetic, in fact he was worst of all
Every item on the menu was completely overpriced
I never thought that I could eat a bad dish of Pasta until last night
I had dinner at Peperoncino last night with my wife and daughter, and we had a very pleasant evening
Our 4-yr old was entertained watching the pizza man make margherita

7 rating !!!!! WHAT A JOKE
I think its the people that work there that write all those glowing revues
The food is truly crappy
This is quality Chinese food and definitely not your traditional take-out place
The restaurant is also nice, and the service is very professional
I like the steamed seafood and vegies with sauce on the side
great option if you want healthy Chinese food without compromising the taste
My friends and I meet at Our Place Shanghai Tea Garden and we a night full of delicious food, friendly service and good conversation
Our dinner was incredible!! I strongly recommend this restaurant
to be absolutely candid, i gave this restaurant a try the day after another disappointing trip to Shun Lee
the 2 restaurants are *right* next to each other but boy, am i glad i walked into shanghai tea garden
the shrimp dishes and duck are wonderful! you have to try them
the decor isn't quite like Shun Lee but the service will definitely make up for any shortcoming
Authentic Chinese food is so hard to find and especially in midtown
I spent many years in L
A
so I know what good Chinese food tastes like
I also like going to Chinatown, but the hike from 56th (office location) is long so I tried Our Place
It's great
I love their duck wraps and scallops charddonnay!!! The staff is very accommodating too
The food is top-notch, for certain
What sets Our Place apart, however, is the impeccable service
There seemed to be as many waiters as customers when we were there they managed to be attentive gracious without being overeager
That's a feat other restaurants don't always manage to pull off
Highly recommended!
Good food, relatively low prices, nice atmosphere
One of the waiters was nasty and stood there staring and waiting for us to leave even though we were the only people in the restaurant
Another waiter kept hitting on my friend's girlfriend
I would probably go back
I couldn't disagree with sn dazed more
The food is hardly expensive and if you're looking for high quality food with a cheaper price tag, good luck trying to find a restaurant like Our Place in MIDTOWN! The price is more costly than say, Flushing, but so is the quality of the food, the great service, and the location
The restaurant is small but I just had the most HEAVENLY banquet dinner (Our Place had a special Chinese New Year dinner menu)
This was only my 2nd time to Our Place but I'll be coming back for more
Thank you Liza for introducing me to this place!
You can get more authentic Shanghai cuisine in several Chinatown establishments, and a better value in some of them as well
But they also tend to be crowded dumps of questionable cleanliness
A Chinese person used to the City's most authenitc food may balk a bit at Our Place, as the more expensive and refined cuisine here smoothes the edges off some traditional dishes and most recipes seem conceived with a cognizance of a western palate
Well, I'm western and I think the food is great
Great ingredients, fantastic flavor
The soup dumplings are very good, as are the rice cake dishes
The beef and pork used in their food is excellent -- flavorful and tender and definitely NOT the mystery meat occasionally found elsewhere
The decor is appealing; quiet and refined, yet not stuffy
The service is attentive and friendly
Portions are medium-to-large, depending on what you get
I have to say this is the answer to all my what should we eat problems
not only is it good it comes FAST!!! I call and they are at my door shortly after
The portions are big and the price is right! Great Find!! I highly reccomend this one
The Scene This cosmopolitan cousin of the legendary Harry's Bar in Venice is frequented by a wealthy and insouciant crowd, the types who don't bother looking at menu prices when they order
The dining room mirrors its progenitor, a rather snug space swathed in mustard-toned fabric, with mellow lighting and a small bar where you hear more accents than at the UN General Assembly
The Food Because this kitchen is so traditional, dishes here are surprisingly elemental
Take the baked tagliorini with little cubes of ham: It's so rich it will bring you to your knees, but you'll eat the whole thing
Classics like oceanic Venetian fish soup, bracing pasta e fagioli, risotto with bitter radicchio and sea bass cooked in a salt crust--all are exceptional
Italian pastries, freshly made every morning, are hard to turn down
Bored looking girl behind the bar not intersted in finding the barman (not difficult in a small place)
Waiter just going through the motions
Serving tasty food available elsewhere at a third of the price
Wines expensive
There were 8tables that never were turned; on a Sat night seems like rest of NY realised this is just silly
Fur coats on aged ladies drift in and out
zzzzzzzz
The service is atrocious- wait-staff is unfriendly
The ambience is non-existent (tables are crowded together, bright lighting, and constant press of wait-staff around the crowded tables intrusive
The food is sub par; filet mignon ordered medium rare came out well done, salads are uninventive and flavorless and the wine list (although offering a nice selection) is 3 or 4x market price
The only redeeming menu item is the risotto
In a city filled with wonderful Italian restaurants, THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH IT FOR THE $$$$$ and certainly a huge disappointment
Anyone who loves Venice of Hemingway will want to visit Harry Cipriani's
The Cipriani's pride themselves for simple, good tasting food
Unfortunately, that has not been my expereince
But I won't say too much b/c I think I really just had very bad luck the times I've had dinner there (twice)
Still, it is an elegant place for drinks (which is better for your wallet too as the food is exorbitantly priced, not that the drinks are cheap) and if you like dabbing with the rich (and sometimes famous), you'll enjoy this place
Service may not be super friendly but it's very professional
And if they know you, well, that's a whole different story
A nice place to go for special celebration but to really appreciate it, you have to know a bit about it's history otherwise you may be disappointed
Is this place really worth it? Sure, it's on 'Sex the City' and other shows, but it's purely trendy
The service is horrible and the food is so-so
You would think you could get a little better tasting food for the price
But, alas, i guess that's the price you pay for ambiance! Well, the SoHo one, at least
Go early because this place is hot
Cipriani's delivered some of the best Risotta I have ever tasted
Who would have thought that Black squid risotto could taste so good? The service was top notch and the ambience couldn't have been any better
Some say that this bar is a local hangout for many of New York's finest models
By the looks of the people in this restaurant I wouldn't disagree
This is one place that I will return to for more food and good times
Thank you for the fine dining experience
The Scene The long dining room with low ceilings and exposed wood beams feels like a country cottage squashed into a rectangular box
Multitudes of career waiters hover about, yet service feels rather brusque--it no doubt helps to be one of the regulars who dine here solo
In traditional style, many dishes are cooked at a couple of small stations in the middle of the space
The Food Plenty of room is needed in both the belly and the wallet here--diners really should go all four courses
Old standards like spaghetti carbonara--rich, creamy fresh and perfectly balanced with garlic and onions--are revealed in a new light
Main courses, like veal coated in a glaze of cheese and prosciutto, offer decadent pleasures
For those sticking to a diet, salads are surprisingly good, too--peppery baby arugula comes with generous shavings of parmesan and a high quality olive oil-based dressing
I went to this place in my neighbourhood with my boyfriend and a friend of the family at 9
30pm - for NY a decent dinner time

We couldn't get seated until everybody showed up
It would be reasonable, except it was 6pm and the place was literally empty
Food was only so-so
Honestly, with such intense competition around the neighborhood, I would not recommend this restaurant to people
I went there several times and never learned to like it
There are many more better places to go with better food, much better service, nicer ambience and decor
typhoon is by far one of the best japanese restaurants in the city
who cares whether the service is not excellent
it's the food that really matters
i had various dishes with two other friends- steak cubes, sashimi, sushi, seaweed salad and more
let me just tell you that the sushi and sashimi melted in my mouth like butter
the texture of the fish is indescribable
go try it yourself
the portions are not generous but the quality of the food makes up for it
A pretty nice little place in the center of the village
Offers a nice array of appetizers and decent sushi for reasonable prices
Try the stir fried cube steak, shabu sahbu, or the Oden, or anything else you want to try on the menu
So strange to read all the awful reviews here! Are we talking about the same place? I love Typhoon! My fiance and I have been going here for the last five years
We're regulars and although they've changed the manager once and have had several different waitresses/barstaff, the place remains one of our favorite, dependable eatery
The ambiance is great! The sushi chef, Hide, is knowledgeable and friendly, all the waitstaff knows us and remembers our names
The current bartender/hostess has improved a great deal from when she first started
You will definitely get good food for a great deal
It's a find in this overly priced, ostentatious city full of bad restaurants
My friends and I love this place, so it makes me sad that some of the servers have ruined meals
Yea, a few of them CAN suck (one waitress comes to mind), but others (namely, Satoshi and Ken) are always cool
And no, the food isn't revelatory, but who wants it to be? It's good, authentic Japanese pub grub for cheap, and they serve it up to a laid-back crowd sweetly devoid of posers
Oh, and to the person who complained that her croquettes were fried: try looking up the definition for croquette
lol
Ambience - very nice
Looks like I've stepped back into a hacienda
Shame about the food and service
Yes there was a party going on at the time but it was only around 10 people
So why did it take over an hour for me to get my sushi (and I'd only ordered a few rolls)
And finally when it did arrive it was very vey average
In essence - there's better places than this!
I can't believe that those reviews are actually about the same restaurant
My boyfriend and I went there a couple weeks ago, after reading the great reviews below, and were extremely disappointed
Not only was the food not a ten, it was horrible
The crab croquettes were fried and completely lacking in crabmeat, our meat appetizer was dripping with grease and mostly fatty, and our main course was mushy rice drowned in some sauce with the consistency of baby food
We took one bite of that, and left the rest uneaten
I never write reviews, but I'd like to save someone else the same mistake of going to this place
Stumbled onto this place with a friend and we loved it! The atmosphere itself is worth the trip, but the food is fantastic too
Great place for a first date or dinner with a picky group
This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the city
I probably go about once a week for the amazing Japas (tapas sized innovative Japanese dishes) and everyone I take gets totally hooked
Even my friends visiting from Japan love this place! Try their taka rice, saikoro beef cube steak, crab croquettes, avocado salad with alaskan king crab, karei kara (whole fried flounder with ponzu sauce), mentai spaghetti, udon, super dynamite, nasu hamburg (japanese eggplant parm), el roll (shrimp and chicken wrapped in shiso leaf and spring roll wrap), sesame sauce soba, the list is endless
Finish the meal with the tempura ice cream with rum sauce
Not to mention, your wallet will be pleasantly surprised
this is a great neighborhood sushi corner spot (i live around the corner)
the sushi is more than ok for the price, i would think
meals are tasty and satisfying
miso soup was ok and definitely not it came from a campbell soup can or whatever the previous negative review said
This place has some of the worst sushi I have ever had! Dont know what kind of crack the other reviewers are on, but give me some! Fish was fishy, chicken was bottom feeder, and yes like the other review, the miso soup was like Campbells chicken noodle! Do yourself and your stomach a favor, and avoid at all costs!!!
I have been going to this sushi place for the past four years
This is the best sushi I've had in the area, AND I can still afford to pay my rent
Solid neighborhood place, fresh fish good apps nice service not sushi samba but you don't get hit with the $$$
I've eaten a lot of sushi
And it's not that Kura blows my mind, which has happened at other places, it's just that there's a really good vibe to the place and the food is consistently excellent
Service is relaxed and aware
We regularly travel all the way there from Astoria, Queens, we love it so much
Of course, that gives us an excuse to stop by dba or even Zum Schneider while we're at it
with so many sushi spots in the city, it appears this one will be a favorite of many
very nice place to visit/comfortable, svc food is very good
nice variety, sushi freshness quality counts
SUM IT: everyone should try this spot see if it becomes your favorite
expectations were not disappointed this time around
avoid those all you can eat, $1 sushi specials, large slab sushi spots, etc
give this a try!
Kura has the best music policy I have experienced at any restaurant in NYC
Excellent jazz by pianogreats such as Thelonious Monk and BIll Evans
This combined with a perfect balance (not too loud, not too soft) makes it a soothing experience any time, and combined with the superb quality food and wait staff and interior this is a place where you come back again and again
My girlfriend and I stumbled upon Kura after late night weeknight shopping
Wow did our instincts pay off! Excellent food, diverse menu selections, good specials, great low (romantic) lighting, and all with friendly attentive service
I simply have nothing negative to say about Kura
can't wait to go back!
It is a crime to eat sushi anywhere else in NYC
Great service, great food, great prices
Chef Shiki creates tasty sushi and beautiful cut-paper/origami designs which are hung all around this cute restaurant
Out of the east chains I would say this is the closest to authentic Japanese food
The tables are really cute and done in true Japanese style where you have to take off your shoes and sit on low tables
There are hibatchi grills in case you are in the mood for skewering and beer comes at a value in pitchers
Overall a great place to eat at
Yakiniku West was the very first place I ever had sushi almost 10 years ago, and I haven't found a comparable alternative since
Prices are extremely reasonable for the selection, quality, and variety
I have had nothing but excellent service - always friendly and attentive while not being pushy
This is a city of endless dining options, but Yakiniku West will always be my first and favorite choice
Before finally making my move to NYC, this was the one given stop on any and all of my visits
Yakiniku West, with their sumptuous barbecue steak that is so finely sliced that it cooks to perfection in under a minute per slice, we can't have chosen a better spot
Their bibim bap is so exquisite, we were left craving for more even after we were sitting there like stuffed turkeys
Not to mention Yakiniku West's authentic beer that goes along with all this food to enhance the overall culinary experience
Be prepared for an awakening of your senses, from delightful aromas to the stimulation of your taste buds
You'll be in for a royal treat
The downside? There's always a flip side to the story
They don't take reservations on weekends
So you'll have to wait in line for a little while
But trust me, it'll be worth the wait
I have been coming to this great restaurant for years
Their style and food are top notch
The only setback is the wait, but it takes you away from the worries of the World
The sushi was great

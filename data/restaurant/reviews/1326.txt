I doubt I'll be going back
Though it's fun to hang out and browse the store while waiting, the whole operation seemed very disorganized (as someone else mentioned, clueless hostess and poorly managed waiting area) and the service left a great deal to be desired
It took a long time to get our drinks (water, tea, coffee), and I had to remind the waiter to bring syrup for my French toast
The food was acceptable, but not spectacular or even memorable
The ambience is nice, and it might be a nice place to have a drink or a scone, but I can think of a number of less expensive and more enjoyable places to have brunch
I had lunch at 202 with a friend and while the food was OK, I loved this venue
So I decided to have my b-day party there
So, two weeks in advance, I reserved for a party of 30 and proceeded to send out invitations
Two days later, I get a call from 202 telling me that the space had already been reserved by someone else, which they had not realized when they confirmed availability to me
They gave me a long-winded excuse that the manager with whom I spoke did not realize that the other manager had already booked it
Well, this is why 99% of restaurants out there keep log books with reservations to avoid this!  So while it's a great venue and concept, the place is just very poorly managed
And until they get their act together, I don't plan to give them any more business
Brunch at 202 left much to be desired
From the hostess who could not even collect names and seat people in an efficient manner to the food/service, much improvement is needed
The hostess was inefficiently seating people and disappeared for minutes at a time, letting the line grow to 15+ people waiting to put their names on the list
When finally seated, a door was left open on a chilly day
It took management at least 10 minutes to close it
When the food arrived, it was sub par
Eggs were runny and undercooked while the bread was burnt
They do not even know how to brew tea properly, having pushed down the strainer immediately in their modern tea makers without letting the leaves brew properly
And in one maker, they put a tea bag, not even tea leaves
Quite amateur
Delicious menu offerings
highly recommend as a spot to meet friends for a laid back brunch
Perfect eggs on toast with grilled mushrooms, gorgeous light pancakes with berries and orange blossom syrup
Menu specials and varied desserts looked very enticing as well
Charming European atmosphere and great service
Nice for a snack before shopping as well- Nicole Farhi has such beautiful things
A good concept, and an even better execution
The menu is small, but everything is very good and low priced
The drinks are STRONG
Hipster crowd, but not pretentious
Ideal for a warm summer nights
You have to listen over the noisy outdoor din so the sweaty cook in the food truck by the wall yells out your order is ready
The cheese corn is fabulous
The Cuban sandwich is ok, but needs better bread
Great fries! Plantains were good, but the portion was kinda skimpy
Overall, a great addition to Bklyn
Truly a gem in NYC
There's really no concise way to explain this spot
you have to check it out to really understand what it embodies
The owner is really chill, the employees friendly, the music great
You have to try the spicy, cheesy corn; it's addictive
If you want a unique, mellow day in New York, this is the place to go
This place is just great
Solar-powered electricity, tons of outdoor seating, a funky, fun ambiance and music
Beer, corn on the cob and other snacks are served out of a colorful cart
Make sure to come on the weekends when they have a flea market
The food is good, the coffee is decent (but not great), but the service is extremely spotty and can be very slow
Often the store seems understaffed
They will have one person taking orders, and this person also makes the coffee drinks and gets the food
So every order takes a long time, and if there is a line you have to wait upwards of 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee
I often see people leaving out of frustration after waiting in line and realizing how slow it is; I've done the same myself
The sanwiches are good but overpriced compared to similar quality in other places
I just finished eating a sandwich that was delivered to my office from wichcraft
While the food was good, two sandwiches and a little thing of yogurt and granola cost $33! Even though my boss paid for it, I felt guilty for eating a meal which I could have gone downstairs to get for $20 less
My advice, go to a deli instead
This place was great but they closed up shop months ago
A new restaurant is in the spot
It's called Sadie Mae's Cafe
You magnificant bastards, you've done it again
The owner of Nana has taken the delectable cuisine of the 5th ave
staple, added Yakitori (japanese barbecue) and created an even more ambient atmosphere
If you like good food,high end sake and quiet dining all for a relatively affordable price Yakitori canteen is for you
I would recomend a specific dish, but the truth is everything is perfect
You may find yourself waiting a little longer than your used to,but only because they wont let any food leave the kitchen until it is flawless in taste and design
I could go on and on about this place all day, but instead you should just try it for yourself

Check out the lounge in the back yard
whooah!
This place has a really great and diverse menu
The atmosphere is pretty swanky
The food was pretty good, but we waited almost an hour and a half to get our order, and it wasn't even crowded
On top of that, one of our orders came about 15 minutes after the first one
Definately not worth the wait!
I grew up in Philly, and I gotta tell ya, these steaks are the real deal
Go now! You'll be glad you did
It's a bit pricey for what it is, but it's money well spent
All I can say if you've ever had a real cheesesteak, then you'll appreciate what this place has to offer
It is the best I've had outside of philly
The staff is friendly, the place is clean
I will definatly be back
This place is a mess! Two things stand out 1) The meat on the cheesesteak sandwich was so fatty I couldn't even chew it and 2) the owner was behind the counter screaming and swearing so loudly at an employee (who he fired in front of everyone) that no one could possibly enjoy their meal
Everyone just exchanged can you believe this? looks
When I'm in the mood for a greasy cheese steak, this is the ONLY place I consider
The kitchen is fast, but you sometime may have trouble getting a seat, since this place is very small
It's worth the risk though
This place rocks! If you are looking for the real deal cheesesteaks this is the place
As good as philly
The steaks were tender, greasy, perfectly cooked onions, and the bread was spot on
The staff is friendly, and it is a comfortable room, with a warm brick wall adorned with old philly photos, an amazing original rocky poster, and who can look away from there huge flat screen
Forget Ruth, Frankie, or any other steak places, this place as the best meat in town
Sides are all great, appetizers are all good
I've been to 4 in the country and although this one wasn't the best out of them, the meat was still good
My only gripe is that the chefs
apparently they don't know how to cook it without some buzzer that sounds to let them know it's done
So it's kinda on a timer or machine? We sat back by the kitchen and the entire time we heard 'BEEEEEEEEEEP' every couple of mins
It was very annoying
A BUSINESS MAN'S DREAM! GREAT ATMOSPHERE! GREAT LOCATION! ABSOLUTE GREAT STEAKS! EXTENSIVE WINE LIST

It was cold because it was sitting out
Besides, did he now expect me to eat it?? Obviously, we're crossing this one off our list
No one can beat the way Valenti cooks his fish
Never over-cooked, not too much spices, and just the right amount of taste added to bring out the best taste of that fish
So far I think this is the best place to eat seafood
YES, CESCA IS VERY BUSY( ALIVE) ON A SAT NITE ,AS IT SHOULD BE, THE AMBIENCE IS WARM SOPHISTICATED
THE SERVICE WAS OVER THE TOP, ESP FOR THOSE DINERS WHO DON'T TAKE THEMSELVES TOO SERIOUSLY
THANK YOU TOM/BLAIR FOR A WONDERFUL NITE OUT, EVEN IF ONE YOUR AMARI RECOMMENDATIONS TASTED LIKE A PHARMACEUTICAL REJECT
THE MEAT DISHES WERE ZESTY/FLAVORFUL
NEVER HAD BETTER LAMB OR PORK
FOR THE LIPID CHALLENGED THE TUNA WAS AMONG THE BEST
I WOULD RETURN JUST FOR THE ROASTED OYSTERS ALONE
AWORK OF GENIOUS
WILL ALSO RETURN TO SAMPLE THE PASTAS/ FRITTERS/ETC
WHAT A MENU!

I thought snooty wait staff went out of style a couple of years ago, but not at 'Cesca
On our waiter's first visit to our table he didn't bother to greet us
He simply interrupted our conversation to tell us the special and then whisked away from our table, leaving us perplexed
It got worse when I asked him for a recommendation and he went on and on about how he didn't have enough information about what I like
Then my friend said nicely, I know everything is good right? And the waiter actually replied, yes that's why it took you so long to get a reservation
Yikes, learn some manners! Oh and the hostesses never cracked a smile and barely uttered a word
On the bright side the food is very good, as the Times wrote today, but not excellent
The room is gorgeous and the prices reasonable
Was very glad to hear of a high quality rest
in my neighborhood but was disappointed in service and food
Although service food at the bar table was great (paninis are great), food and service at our dinner table (do not sit by the open kitchen!) was disappointing
First of all, I think our service person was miffed that we couldn't order much for apps or drinks since we had already started at the bar
Thus her attitude was rather nonchalant and unenthusiatic
After ordering, our main course arrived after 45 minutes, our service person stopped by our table, probably only 3 times during the dinner
Towards the end of the dinner, we were greased out by the open kitchen with a terrible greasy fishy atmosphere
We promptly left, heading home for a shower
My boyfriend and I tried this place last night after having read about it in Time Out, and man, was it fantastic
The place looks great - fancy and upscale without feeling stuffy or too old
The staff was amazingly helpful and polite (especially Amina!), and the service was quick but not too quick
And the food really was incredible
Northern Italian mostly, very well-prepared, with interesting combinations of things, like our sardine and egg appetizer
Highly recommend the mushroom and sheep's cheese appetizer - divine! And our chocolate dessert (can't remember the name but it's the only chocolate one so you'll know it) was awesome too
Great wine list and good advice from our other waiter
Well worth the money
I can't say enough about this place - everyone should try it!!!
We ordered from Bravo twice, because we thought we'd give them a second chance- BIG MISTAKE! The first time we ordered, we waiting over an hour for the pizza then they messed up the order and didn't bring the full order
Then after a an half hour wait, they brought the remainder of the order (cold I might add) The second time we tried ordering from them- it took them 2 hours to deliver! We will never again order from this pizza store!
OK, I have not eaten there yet, but using city search I found BP and e-mailed them a question
I received the nicest reply with some helpful info
for my group
I'm in charge of food for my group of women travelers and Bravo Pizza delivery to the hotel sounds like a wonderful option! If their food is half as good as their customer service, my group will be very pleased with Bravo Pizza
Love this place
the pizza is by far the best I've had in jersey city and is right up there with the best NYC has to offer
The guy that works there making the pizza is super nice too
The only thing is the hours, because it's mainly a bakery you can't always get the pizza cause i htink they close after they sell all the bread for the day
Conti's is, in every aspect, a great italian bakery, from their great old fashion look to their great friendly service
People from all over come to buy baked goods there, especially their famous boston cream and cream pies
their pies and pastries are so light and delicious
when i go to a family outing i must bring something from contis or else im not allowed to go!
Here's a place that's been around since 1921 and has kept the same Old fashioned Italian recipes alive
There's not a place anywhere in the US that can give you a cream pie as delicious and fresh as Conti's
Their cakes, butter cookies and pastries are better than any words can describe
A must in this lifetime
if you dig delectable steak, try the jakes filet
an amazing piece of meat topped with gorgonzola and fried onions complimented with a port wine sauce
or try the prime rib
the best i've had at any steakhouse in all of new york city
(and i've been to many of them)  most of the wait staff is par excellence, with a couple of exceptions
note: the female servers are always good
If you live in Washington Heights or Riverdale, there is actually decent Japanese takeout available
This place makes good maki rolls, eel(!), tempura, etc
It's nice that it exists
My beau and I stumbled upon Cafe Luise and continue to go back for more and more and more
The Moroccan burger (Moroccan spices with MANGO!) is excellent
The reviewer who thought it tasted wrong is probably used to pub food
I am so addicted to it, I just can't seem to pry myself away from it and order something else! Luckily, I've gone with many friends who've let me grab a bite of their pork chop or steal a mussle or two, for variety
I have never been disappointed
The coctails are interesting, as well, though rather sweet
It is no longer BYOB, so order a bottle of wine, sit back, and taste the world
I have lived in the LES for the last ten years and i have to say I love Cafe Luise so i felt compelled to defend her after reading the last review
I have been there over twenty times and i have NEVER had a bad meal
When the restaurant opened i was so happy there was finally a place in my neighborhood that seemed like it was made for the neighborhood
Inventive and fresh Food, mixing sweet and spicey elements
I can't believe they did not like the pork chops - that is my favorite dish and the hamburger - so different, filled to the brim with spices!! Plus the prices an under $25 gem!!  Luise feels like an extension of my living room
albeit much nicer
I am always satisfied, plus i do not feel like i have to chop my arm off to pay the bill
Sadly, this was one of the worst dinners my husband and I have ever had in NYC
So bad that it was funny
The menu sounded good but the grilled eggplant roll was oversauced with a pile of mint, pork chop was leathery, and everything just tasted wrong
The room was pretty but don't make the same mistake we did
Just go somewhere else
Really
I agree with the reviewer who says that all the glowing reviews must have been written by the owners' friends
The food was good but way too expensive
And portions are small, especially the appetizers
My eggplant appetizer (I forget the name) cost something like $8 and was tasty but TINY, which was emphasized by the huge plate it came on
I don't know why this place ended up in the cheap eats category
I would go there again only if they reduced the prices by 50 percent
This may be harsh, but I feel like the glowing reviews of this restaurant were all written by friends of the owners
I went for brunch today and the food was bad
My boyfriend's eggs benedict came on flimsy white toast with so much dill in the hollandaise that the dish tasted like a dill pickle
Who puts dill in hollandaise? And if you're going to add that much, the menu should specify it
The yolks were hard boiled- easter egg style
The side of mixed greens with my watery omelette amounted to a pile of ripped romaine lettuce leaves with no dressing

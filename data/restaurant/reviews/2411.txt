But the lobster pasta was so bad and so un-fresh we had to send it back, and they charged us for two extra entrees without any explanation
When I complained to the manager, he changed the bill but didn't apologize
I called the next day and spoke to another manager, but he didn't offer any kind of compensation
My father did love his food, but I'll never go back here, not with the management's attitude
Went to Fresco for the second time yesterday
The food (Eggplant and Zucchini pie) was much better than last time (can't remember what I had, if that says something)
The service seemed fine to me
The prices, however, are a little bit out of control
My lunch entree was $22 and I was turned off by the fact that they will charge you an entree price if you order a salad for lunch (c'mon - a $22 salad!)
Gotta make sure they squeeze each person for at least $20 bucks!
I've been entertaining clients at Fresco for a couple of years now on a few occasions, but have decided that this I will no longer be visiting
It is a wonder to me why this one bartender in particular is still employed there
Perhaps she is a relative of the Scotto family? Her service has always been a let- down and after this last visit, i will no longer be returning
It's a shame, the food really is quite good
I am a regular customer of Fresco and am always impressed with the service and the quality of the food
The Scotto family is great at making you feel at home
It is my regular place to bring clients and friends from out of town
We ordered from this place all the time and they made many minor mishaps (ie
wrong food, wrong person)
However, it wasn't until their delivery guy made a $10 mistake and the manager at the restaurant refused to remedy the situation and keep us as customers
In fact, he told me he didn't care
Way to go
there are 55 of us together on this floor and everyone heard me arguing with him
we have all decided not to order from them again
Seems to me, that $10, wasn't worth the hundreds they just lost
Excellent food, excellent service, and most importantly, excellent guiness, maybe the best in the city
It should be considering how seriously Mike takes his Guinness!!!
My omelette and potatoes were very good, and the complimentary screwdriver wasn't all watered down
Ate at the bar, and the barman was attentive, if a bit impersonal
Waitress who helped me out was very nice
Very dark bar, so doesn't really scream welcome on a sunny day, but the food's good
This bar is our local hangout
The owner/bartender is a great guy and really interesting to talk to
All of the staff is nice, never an attitude, they have a great jukebox with real lots of classic rock n roll and Irish bands as well
Very nice ambience, good service, great sushi (they can make you any special roll), great wine, very clean place
A bit expensive, but worth it
the only problem is that they close too early on the weekeday (about 10 PM)
I went here for lunch because I work right by it, and I had a really bad experience
The cashier tried to overcharge me and then got huffy when I asked for a break-down
In addition, she charged me $1 for two extra packets of soy sauce
The sushi seemed stale and the hot food was gross as well
I was so upset by her meanness, that I had a good mind to knock over the stand of nuts by the door as I walked out
I decided to write this review instead! Corner delis are a dime a dozen in NY, and there is no reason I would go back here
I recommend staying away
Oxford Cafe, righ by it on Lex is much cleaner, the food is better and people are normal and nice
The place is clean, the people are friendly the food is great ! Everything is so fresh delicious ! ! After ordering I always stand on line look into the display case see something else I want to try ! The prices are great for midtown too
They have ready made specialties or you decide exactly what you want in your wrap or salad ! I just wish they had seating ! !
Lite Bites makes all of their salad sandwiches with low fat or no mayo - and for a reasonable price - a rare find among amist all the pricey chains
Plus, they'll let you substitute a piece of fruit for the free chips - a nice bonus!
I recently forgot to order on a Friday at lunch
I called Abitino's and ordered 40 pies last minute and got it delivered to my office in 45 minutes
The pizza was delicious; the crispy crust and tasty sauce made the office happy! Abitino's Pizza is the best under pressure
the pizza at Abitino's is unbelivable
They have the best sauce,pizza is always fresh and never laying there and the staff is friendly and professional
This is a hidden gem in Sutton Place
Thin crust pizza, fabulous eggplant rollatini, ceasar salad, BYOB
The neighborhood likes to keep this a secret
A quiet BYO restaurant above the pizza place
Good service, great views (it's on the second floor) and solid italian fare
A hidden gem in the Sutton Place area
Seriously, my friends and I call this My Favorite Pizza Place
The pizza is great, the service is SO friendly
and it's in a great midtown location!
Not just your ordinary pizza
also great fast Italian food
midtown location
Wonderful family run business! Always welcoming and nice
I've brought 9 kids there (many times) and they lap up the pizza, and have a big room to move around in while waiting
They seem to enjoy the kids, even when they're not behaving their best
Aside from the people
the pizza is tasty, the sauce on the sweet side
Also, a few salads on the ready so mom doesn't have to eat pizza everyday!
Fresh Basil offers the tastiest, most delicious dishes at the best and most affordable prices! Above and beyond most critically accalimed restaurants in the area, Basil's consistently serves food that tastes as if their kitchen was staffed by a dozen Italian grandmothers! From the daily specials to the stand-by regulars, this is a menu that is the best kept secret in midtown
Fresh Basil's is a MUST for lunch for anyone lucky enough to be within 20 blocks
Bring a hearty appetite for this gem and SSssssssshhhhhhhh
don't spread the secret to fast!
In Short  A famed architectural redesign and a seasoned chef keep this striking spaceship-like restaurant on the radar
From the catwalk entrance to the showcase of arrivals on flat screens stretched above the bar--this spot was designed to see and be seen
The predominately male, dark suit-sporting clientele discuss raising funds in Dubai while munching on hearty lobster bisque, scallops with pork belly confit or classic burger with frites
The more intimate conversations occur in pod-like padded booths
Classy, trendy looking atmosphere
Great menu
Varied enough for a picky eater
Mouthwateringly good
Large portions
Some appetizers could be entrees
Prices are surprisingly reasonable
I'm a female and dined with a girl friend but the restaurant was big on romantic appeal
If anyone know of any other places like this I'd love to know because it would be missing one thing----me
Personally my wife and I like the bar the best
But we always have something to eat when we visit
The food is good, the service divine and we will always go there when we miss Tim the bartender or maybe the restaurant manger
We are not precisely certain of his role there, but he always offers us something great to eat, fills our glasses without our asking and generally makes us feel welcome
Even when we are not hungry we always try the french fries and harict vert
I go out to eat every day of the week
The one thing I cannot stand is when a restaurant can't deliver
So, when I saw hamburgers on the menu along side some very interesting items, I thought I was in for another let down
Boy was I wrong
What a place! Beautiful, reasonably priced and some of the best food I've ever had
The scallops and pork belly just melted in my mouth

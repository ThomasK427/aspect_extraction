When I complained regarding the poor tiramisu, the waitress made a flip comment regarding the fact that I shouldn't order an italian dessert in an irish restaurant
I would have appreciated a credit to my check but she suggested bringing cheesecake
As I was already stuffed, I opted for the sorbet which I split with my dining companion
Another couple joined my wife and I for a pre show dinner at Langans's and really had a good trip
The staff was very courteous and competent and we all ordered from the prix-fixed price menue
We all enjoyed the food and pleasant surroundings very much and would definately recommend this as a pre show dining spot
My only complaint revolves about why New York restaurants refuse to learn that the rest of the world will gladly issue separate checks for groups of four! How simple it would be to make their patron's life easier!
I took my wife to have dinner before Broadway
This is the second time we have been here
The service and staff are excellent
They are all very friendly and kind
We had an excellent meal
The desserts were wonderful
The bread served before the meal was also excellent
We chose from the prix-fixed menu both times and were not disappointed
The value for the meal was the best we have ever had in NYC
Plenty of choices are on this menu
We were not rushed
Our meal was served in a timely fashion
Many times a staff member came to check our table , refill glasses, inquire about our meal
The place is very interesting
We enjoyed our whole experience
You are very wrong--we noted that children can be taken here--just not small ones
Great place!!
they pour the Guinness properly here  the dining room in the rear is very nice, and the food is pretty good as well  Also great for hanging out at the bar and sharing a pint or two
I went here for a Thanksgiving dinner and was pleasantly surprised
The atmosphere was great
One could enjoy the jovial Irish bar scene or sneak away to a booth for a romantic dinner
The service was great and the food was fantastic (I highly recommend the Butternut Squash)
I took a group of 65 women to Langan's for dinner on Friday, Nov
15
Everyone had the pre-theater dinner
The food was wonderful
(Especially the salmon!) The service was terrific
We were warmly welcomed and treated as valued guests
I would wholeheartedly reccomend Langan's for group events!
Langan's continues to offer the best service in midtown
The Bartenders are always cracking jokes, and making everyone feel welcome
Not to mention thier knack for filling your drinks up constantly
On second thought, don't go here, I want the place to myself
The Scene Entering this peaceful old-school oasis of Indian cuisine, the casual diner may be most struck by the unexpected spaciousness--white-clothed tables set a reasonable distance apart, roomy, comfortably shabby-chic booths, high ceilings and a staircase leading to the equally well-appointed upper level
Even at lunch, when lawyers and publishers flock in to wheel and deal over the justly-popular lunch buffet, the atmosphere remains serene
Numerous and attentive waiters, though occasionally a trifle undertrained, are almost infinitely obliging
The Food The standard Northern Indian restaurant staples you'd find down on Sixth Street are on the menu here, but prepared with greater care and finesse
Samosas are lighter and less greasy; tandoori and chicken tikka adequately moist and delicately seasoned; nan and paratha slightly charred and never oily; dhal flavorful and rich
But it's the curries that stand out the most, distinctly seasoned without overwhelming their component flavors
Went to Jewel with a group from work and we were very pleased
Friendly attentive service, hot, fresh food and everyone in the restaurant was courteous
We got a bunch of different dishes(chicken, lamb veggie) and shared them
each one was top notch
We'll be back
well i heard a lot about jewel of india and decided to try it out
I went there on a sat it wasnt that busy, but it still took someone 5 mins just to come ask how many
and then still had to wait about 10 mins
So i sat down with my GF at the time and a waiter comes and we order starters before he leaves his shoulder knocks over my drink on my pants isnt that just great
well then starters came a bit late and not that warm
i give the starters a C+
later we had maincourse most of it was good some was really bad
Service was very bad
My overall grade is D+
No service at all
foood was cold
and waiter were chit chatting
many people say this was the best i went there just to see what was so special, food was cold, service was horrible
never going back
the place was not even packed and i had really bad service and the foood took forever
and it was cold
Service is not particularly warm, but I've gone back again and again (for dinner) over the years on an almost monthly basis
The restaurant is gorgeous though a little shabby and I enjoy the quiet atmosphere
I've tried many different dishes and they are all incredibly delicious, especially the lamp pasanda, the goat dish, and the pulao
We've never left there disappointed or hungry
I'd say it's not an exceptional value but a place to treat yourself and your friends
Nobody eats in the TD for value, but the prices at this place are large, the portions are smallish and it is overall lacking in the little extras -- like butter on the naan or rice with the entrees
Chicken Tikka Masala with rice and naan shouldn't cost over $20
There's nothing wrong with the food, but it's just good; I've eaten at least a dozen better Indian restaurants in the city
It's better than cheap Indian takeout, sure, but it's no value
Then there's the decor
I imagine that this place height of distinguished chic in the late 1970s, but now it just feels like you wandered onto the set of Scarface
The interior could really use a make-over and the chairs should just be chucked and replaced -- some of them are falling apart
I went to this place with some family that I hadn't seen in a while
If not for the virtue of that fact I would've noticed much sooner just how long it was taking for our food to arrive
Appetizers took their sweet time in coming, and literally about an hour later we had our main dishes which were very small considering the price
The food was consumed in a matter of minutes and we got out of there as soon as we could
I've had better Indian food for less than half the price
The food at Jewel is good, not great, just good
The vindaloo was rich and extra spicy, to my liking
The curries were ok and they custom made a southern Indian dish for us which was also good
The breads were average for Indian; naan good, onion kulche good, poori not so good
The problem with the overall experience was the price
You pay midtown theatre prices for good takeout food
I wasn't displeased with my meal, just what I paid for it
The ambience is good
The food is not extraordinary
I had paneer makhni for take out, and decided to try this place
But other dishes were disappointing, and not worth the price
I will not go back there
a very reasonable lunch option for its location
Good food, excellent service, very nice atmosphere
Recommend
I remember having a good experience the last time we went (a few years ago, also based on citysearch recommendations)

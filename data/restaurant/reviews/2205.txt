I regret having patronized this place
$50 for a mediocre lunch with the added pleasure of being treated more rudely than I have ever been treated in my entire life
Apparently, some people think that it's charming and so New York to get treated so rudely, but it's NOT
When you're paying good money, you should be receiving good food and good service
The pastrami was mostly fat, and the chicken soup was a brine with a few floating pieces of raw, pink chicken
Stage Deli serves monster sandwiches, but to be honest, so do most NYC delis
Plus, you do pay the price for the sandwiches (expect to take home leftovers)
Nevertheless, I really did enjoy the corn beef/pastrami sandwich
The mish mash soup is excellent though I don't like how they charge extra for sharing, though again that is common with other NYC delis as well
Service was friendly and courteous
There was a crazy lady in the restroom, but hey, it's New York! The only true negative is the cramped seating
It's the worst breakfast I have ever had! The food was inferior and they have the decency to charge you $12 for eggs and sausage that are not remotely close to being good
For that amount, they still charge you $2
50 for a cup of coffee
The sausage even tasted old
Don't ever go there for breakfast
You won't leave here hungry, the sandwiches are so high you can't put them in your mouth we love the homestyle chicken soup (the mish mash could feed a family of four)--don't be fooled, you do pay for the lavish amounts of food you get, but the experience is worth the trip
I usually visit Stage Deli when I visit NYC but I won't go there ever because during my last viist we were very rudely treated by the managers, the food quality was poor (watery perogi, frozen stuffed cabbage) and the tab prices $45 was rediculous
The managers rudely tell people they have to wait outside
They shifted us to the counter and then shifted us again because we were in the way
What a joke
Walk to 8 th avenue and get better food for half the price
Every visit to NY must have a deli on the food list
Whether you like corned beef or pastrami you must stop by and see Norman
He has been there for decades and can still tell what you would like before you order it
Try the special sandwiches but be prepared for more than you can eat at one sitting
I like to take the second half back to my hotel and let it stink up the room to remind me that NY delis are still the best in the world
It's a New York gem
It does have its problems: rude service, high prices, long waits, but you still gotta try it! The motza ball soup is incredible along with their cheesecake which a slice of is big enough to serve six people
The waitress was awful, the food was bland and tasteless even if there was a ton of it
If you would rather quantity over quality then this is the place for you
Also there is a $15 per person minimum
I had the meatloaf that I would have fed to my dog had I been at home
My partner had the skirt steak that wasn't that bad, at least it was edible and we both ate it
The only thing that was good was the potato knish, but at $3 a piece one would have to eat 5 to reach the minimum
So I have been here after the theater, and that seems like the best time to go
I don't like the $15 minimum when you just go in there for coffee and a piece of that cheesecake
I have no cons, other than that, so I will just go later
Yes, that corned beef is brilliant, and those desserts! A great deli, and the selection is great
Good service every time
I love this place and have been coming for over 10 years
The cheesecake is the best in the city and the corned beef it out of this world!!!!!!!
Sandwiches here are never shy on the main ingredient
This is the place to experience a sandwich, not matter what your preference, you are overshelmed by both the portion size and quality
The service is exceptional and the wait staff is exactly what you anticipate-professional
Cheesecakes are all twenty-pounds or more, and it takes all of your strength to finish any dessert solo, so plan on sharing
Ray Gaither, Brooklyn  When you say the word DELI, only one place enters my head
The Stage Deli
Great service, outstanding food
I still haven't finished a complete sandwich
The Scene The bright, cheerful dining room is packed daily with Japanese customers who come to slurp all manner of soups, some of which are served in bucket-sized portions
Cheerful servers in black T-shirts efficiently hustle back and forth, making this a great place for lunch on the run
The Food You can get more than soup on the lengthy Japanese menu, but that's where the kitchen focuses its energy
The house special is ramen, and virtually all renditions are terrific
One of the best is Hakata Ramen, a sublimely flavorful broth with perfectly cooked thin noodles and thin slices of pork bobbing on top
Crisp and golden Japanese dumplings, with assorted fillings, make a pleasing side dish
This place has a selection of Izakaya (appetizer menu) as well as a good variety of noodle soups to offer
Lunch specials are especially good value, while during dinner time there is a lot of little interesting appetizers available
Good food, good value, no fuss
Amazing ramen noodles
Best I've ever had
Ranks as one of the best noodle houses in city behind Soba-Ya and Onigashima
Menchankotei is decent food
Their strongest dishes are grilled and the Oden(a great traditional cold weather food)
The space is cramped, but the location is good
Just because Japanese people are working and eating there does not mean its good
If you want REALLY good ramen, go around the block to Men-Kui-tei or Tan-Tan-ramen downtown
What Menchankotei does well, they excel at, but it isn't the ramen
one of the best japanese noodle shops in the city
Yes, Japanese businessmen from nearby offices often dine here
The owner is apparently Japanese as well and the menu is authentic-looking
But if you want to spend good money on quality Japanese cuisine, skip this place
I had the ramen and the portion was rather small
I finished the noodles and was still hungry
Not going back
The Scene Since 1984, the Petrossian family--international purveyors of caviar, foie gras and other luxury comestibles--has proffered the good life from this small wrap-around room in the ornate Alwyn Court building
Mirrors etched with flowing Beaux Arts nymphs, geometric deco sconces, curvaceous crystal chandeliers and a long bar underlit with pink screens are opulently old-fashioned
Aristocratic New Yorkers of a certain age and culinarily-minded tourists line the banquettes, nonplussed by stuffy service and high prices
The Food While Russian, Iranian and, most recently, American caviar tastings are the main draw, the French-inspired menu is surprisingly accessible for less-indulgent diners
Begin with velvety celeriac soup, rich with apple-foie gras chutney, or braised duck Lyonnaise salad, intensified with duck prosciutto
Pan-roasted salmon over red pepper, potato and smoked sturgeon hash is a hit, but spicy triple-decker Reuben layered with smoked salmon and sweet cabbage is less so
Traditional desserts are sweet redeemers
The prix fixe meal they served for Restaurant Week (Jan 27) was the worst we ever had
For an additional $12 they served the bottom-of-the-line caviar, which was ordinary at best
My husband's shrimp was burned, and my salmon was overcooked
The desserts were unremarkable as well
The reviews suggest that they may ordinarily have good food - just be sure to stay away during restaurant week!
I am european, due to business and pleasure I travel around the world and eat at the best restaurants
Petrossian is always on my list
Superb food and service, unique ambience, not snobby
I highly recommend it and will return when in NY!
If you have the means to splurge for a peerless celebration of luxury, Petrossian is the place
My worry that it might be something of a clip joint was entirely displaced by my experience there last night, one of unmatched indulgence and delight
To wit, we ate large quantities of ideal caviar presented with grace and refinement, not silly ceremony
If our toast points ever cooled, waitstaff replaced them unbidden
We also sampled some of the world's best wines in this comfortable, beautiful, and surprisingly inviting jewel box of a restaurant
Even more, the kitchen follows up with entrees and desserts which are uniformly marvelous specimens of classic French haute cuisine
As long as I live, I will remember the evening joyfully
Went there on Saturday night on Nov 8
Some people in our party got stuck in traffic and made it 30 minutes later but kept table for us all that time while we were waiting for them and having drinks at the bar

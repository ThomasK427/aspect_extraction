We had a cozy table on the balcony overlooking the restaurant/bar
Enjoyed listing to the live music
The food was delicious
Their specials are the way to go
The regular menu is good as well, but the specials are really good
I have been going to this Greenwich Village restaurant for years
I have had many an wonderful meal there,,,and the Jazz has never been better
not only was the apple salad wonderful and refreshing , the garage steak was delicious as well
this evening was made perfect by great service and AMAZING JAZZ
I have always loved Garage,,,and have always highly recommended it
believe it or not, I think they have gotten better with time
something most places dont do!!!
long live Garage and long live great Greenwich Village Jazz!!!!
Two of us had dinner on Saturday night
We had a reservation and were seated upstairs promtly right next to another table for two
The people were talking so loud we couldn't have a converstion of our own
The jazz was very good
The dinner average
The staff was efficiant and friendly
There are too many really good restaurants in New York for us to return here, but it was ok
A free 10-man jazz show with a reasonably priced gourmet dinner
What else can you ask for?  Food is terrific
Like many people, I love going out to eat, but usually there is SOMETHING that sort of deminishes the experience
But this place really blew me away with great food, ambience, and service
It was just a perfect night, the food was perfectly cooked, served at the perfect time, and the atmosphere was just beautiful
I think they really stand out with the sea bass, but all their food is delectable
My point being is that if you are up to some good drinks and a delicous meal, this is the place
I had a fabulous night and I cannot wait to go back!
We had brunch here, 3/12/06, would highly recommend this place
Fast, affordable and great Jazz playing the entire time we dined
The steak was tender and the salad was so fresh
The presentation was so nice that I couldn't wait to start eating
The ambiance was really romantic, and service was pretty good
I love their penne ala vodka
The jazz was great
I've never heard such incredible jazz for free! Call me a regular!
I went to the garage on a sat
night in january with 10 people every one loved the food and jazz The steak aupiove was great 2 of my friend had the chilean seabass witch was out of this world thats what will get on my next visit
I'm not really into Jazz, but my friend raved about the Red Snapper
When we went, the Red Snapper was not on special, so, I tried something else, the Chiliean Sea Bass, which is on the regualr menu - and, Oh My Goodness, it was amazing!!! My boyfriend had the Grilled Sirloin with Pocini Mushroom Sauce, and all throughout the meal he wouldn't shut up about how awesome the steak is
And I dealt with the jazz music - it's worth going for just the food
This fun happenign resatuarnt,,,was a great tiem from the get go
the jazz was wonderfull and the atmaosphere was very welcoming
the barstaff was really great
i really cant find anything bad to say about this place
cant wait to try the jazz brunch
Stumbled upon Garage on a Saturday night while walking through the Village
We were looking for a casual spot with good food, atmosphere and live music
also able to accomodate a group of 6 without waiting forever
Lo behold, Garage fit every aspect of what we were looking for
The staff was attentive without being bothersome
The food was served fresh and hot
The music was excellent and the atmosphere was really cool
Also seems like a nice place to hang after work, perhaps next time
What a letdown
This place shuttled us in out like some chain operation
Our food was mysteriously served 4mins after we ordered it
my wife swears her chicken was reheated, rather than freshly grilled
The jazz was quite good, but didn't make this a romantic setting
there was just too much of a process at work by the staff to maximize food receipts in the course of the night
The process was so tight we were on our way 40mins after sitting down
thankfully
The food is nothing to write home about
This place is wonderful, it's one of my favorite restaurants in New York City
The food is always great, and when they have the live Jazz performers, it's just amazing
They have great bartenders/barmaids
The drinks are always good and the service is wonderful
Honestly this place is great
It has gotten a little more expensive these days, but definitely affordable
So, if you enjoy great Performers in Jazz and you like great food and desserts this is the place! Their Creme Brulee is AMAZING!
We walked into Garage and loved the atmosphere immediately
We were greeted by a young lady who was very pleasant and striking
She seated us at a table with a view of the band and the incredible stone fireplace
Our server, Suzette greeted us as soon as we sat down and we had our drinks within 5 minutes
How rare is this on a Saturday night at a busy restaurant
The food is excellent with many dishes to choose from and desserts were yummy but we could have used a few more selections
We will definately return
my date and i went in there just for the music and drinks, but would up having an appetizer of coconut shrim and a caeser salad
little expensive for the portions, but still good anyway
drinks were ok, nothing extraordinary about the
ambiance of the place is very nice
but most importantly, the music was fabulous
the live jazz bad was well worth the visit
i'd go back to try dinner, but would go just to sit at the bar and listen to the band
service wasn't that good
either from be shorthanded or just bad service
The place was good
Pretty uninspired on the whole as far as food and wine, but a great space and ambience
Comfortable ambience, talented musicians, and enticing food - all combined to make an excellent brunch experience
The place itself has high, wood-beamed ceilings, brick walls, and a pleasant acoustic layout
The trio of jazz musicians showed a feel for the genre while also playing at the right volume level: loud enough to enjoy it, not so loud that diners needed to shout to hear each other
The banquettes booths on the tiered upper levels are particularly cozy, though sitting at a table along the balcony provides a great birds-eye view of the whole place
As for the food, the vanilla bean soaked french toast is mouthwatering, though for something more savory the benedict mignon really hits the spot
The dessert sampler is a great idea for groups - and at just $4 per person, it's more than reasonable and would be a great accompaniment with some good coffee
my husband and i were in the mood to relax and have a good meal
thats exactly what we got
the ambience was cozy and romantic
the lights were dimly lit and the fireplace was on
the light jazz in the background(live)was perfect
we had the blue cheese salad which was to die for, it had green apples, pecans, cranberries, and a honey white wine vinagerette dressing

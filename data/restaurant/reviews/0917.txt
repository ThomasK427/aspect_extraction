The Food The menu consists of a dozen or so Pan-Asian small plates, all devoid of starch of any kind
The staff recommends three or four dishes per diner; in practice, however, even four may feel skimpy, and ordering five makes for a pretty pricey dinner
Flavors, though, are abundant: The dishes are subtle yet quite tasty
A potent, texturally pleasing salad of squid and mixed fresh beans, and a quartet of Kumamoto oysters with pineapple vinegar stand out
Fatty calf's-head terrine with duck's-tongue salad is a rarefied taste, but excellently prepared
Toro tartare with abalone shreds and sevruga is very nice
Among desserts, the trio of tea-flavored panna cottas is very good
fabulous food, but not for everyone
the tasting menu will allow you to appreciate the superb quality of the ingredients (fresh! fresh!) used here and the artful way in which complex flavors are balanced and blended
every dish i have ever had here has been masterful and remarkable
the caveat: dishes are small with a (heavily) exotic japanese slant
if you come ravenous you will leave less than sated
and if you don't like raw fish or appreciate traditional japanese flavors, you would be better served dining elsewhere
(the black sesme dice with raspberry dessert is lovely, TASTY and always on the changing menu)
I went with three friends
The menu is a little pricey
Each course costs a flat rate (ie
the entrees all cost the same amnt), but it was delicious
I had a chicken entree that was incredible
The texture didnt feel like chicken because it almost melted in my mouth and dessert was great too
I wouldnt reccomend the chamomile pudding (i think that's what it was), but the other desserts were good
The decor is modern and the lighting is intimate
The customers were all 20 and early 30 somethings
Definitely a good date spot but be prepared to spend around $90 for two people, if not more
I went to Sumile this weekend with my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it! The restaurant was so cute and romantic and the food was delicious
The menu was japanese fusion and totally original
I had the pekin duck and it was fantastic
They also had a great drink list and yummy desserts! Plus our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgable I'm definately going back
Its a great spot for dates
maybe Valentine's Day?
I've been here twice now, and everytime I leave thinking that I've just had the one of the best meals that I've ever eaten
The apple and wasabi custard, the gulf shrimp, sashimi and the oysters were all impressive
The bass over a corn puree and the hanger steak are both AMAZING
You can tell this place uses the best ingredients
It's a little pricey, but you absolutely get what you pay for
The tapioca tart was my least favorite dessert, but the panna cotta in lemon juice was just soooo good!   I wish I could eat here every day! I'll definitely be back
I never go on this street to eat, so I would have never thought of going here if it was not for a friend's recommendation
I immediately loved the sophisticated yet down to earth atmosphere
It's definitely zen defined by New York City
The food was amazing from the start, with our salads
The greens literally tasted like they just got picked from the ground and the vinaigrettes were like nothing we've ever tasted
My salmon came perfectly seared and my friend's cod was amazing as well
The service was attentive enough w/o being overbearing, which is always a buzzkill
The food here speaks for the restaurant-beautiful, delicious, effortless, chic, yet approachable
Highly recommended!!!
A few of us went the other night for cocktails (half price!) and ended up staying for dinnerso happy we did
The food was like nothing Ive ever hadIve been to a ton of fusion places in the city (cant help it these days!?), but nothing even compares to Sumile
The crab was absolutely amazing and perfectly balanced and the cod so well cooked, it melted in my mouth
We were all very happy with our meals and look forward to returning soon
I'd heard all the buzz on Sumile and decided to check it out with my Mom for Mother's Day
She loved it
We all did
The food is fantastic, and although the portions are a little small, if you order a few, you'll definitely go home happy
It's a little different, but that's what makes it special
Of note are the pulled skate, the chicken and the braised shrimp
And make sure you try their desserts
Everything we tried was great, not to mention beautiful
From the reviews, it appears that Sumile is not for everyone
If one expects large portions, then go elsewhere
But, I found the dishes to be excellent, and after 3 dishes, I left stuffed
The area is a bit more cramped than I expected, but there were no glitches in the service either
The only complaint would be a rather small sake list, but what was on the list was decent
Busoleil oysters
mediocre with a dash of vinegary sauce
I've had better on a dock with Heinz's cider vinegar
Tartare of bluefin otoro
29$ for four bites of bland otoro (good quality) with rubbery chunks of abalone
Soft egg custard
head down to Aki for Uni Mousse and thank me later
Pulled skate wing
consistency of pasta left in too long, droopy, goopy, and dubious
Breast of duck, almost-raw in a mousse who's sole claim to foie gras is its name
Even the expensive (11-20$) fru-fru drinks lacked flavor and quality ingredients
Even on someone else's dime
I would skip a repeat
We tipped 15% largely for the waitress ability to keep a straight face
Certainly no danger of seeing her again
The decor, nice at first glance, was just more cheap modern glass and dim blue lights
Thank god it is not too far from Corner Bistro
Everyone was starved
It's not the food that was problematic -- that was decent (and would have been great at 1/2 the price) it was the fact that $130 later, we left ravenous
A slice of pizza (total $3
80 for 2) did the trick
$14 for an appetizer -- and they recommended that we each get 3??? Come on
This is New York, we deserve more -- and can get it down the block at Matsuri
Sumile is a rare and welcome accomplishment of culinary perfection
The food is so inventive you wonder if the chef is human
And then another plate comes exceeding expection
The creative drink list is equally well thought out
A concise wine list allows for a perfect match! The staff is gracious and so well-versed in the cuisine, you wonder if they are being paid more handsomely than any other staff in the city
We took the opportunity to test our waiter -- a well-spoken ball of energy with a wit matched only by his charm -- only to find out that he knew every ingredient in every dish single dish
The evening was perfect
I took a first date
Needless to say, there will be a second
We sat down for our 8:30 reservation on a recent Saturday night
The place was recommended by a chef friend of mine who runs quite a few kitchens in town
Anyway, I haven't had a restaurant experience quite like this in years
The drinks and the food were exhilarating to our senses
We ordered a mix of dishes and spent the evening passing them around, while anxiously awaiting to try the next beautifully presented dilectable
The hamachi with melon was so impressive we ordered two more

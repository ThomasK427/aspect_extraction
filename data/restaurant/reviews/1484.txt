Despite that we tried to explain that that had nothing to do with us, the manager was extremely obnoxious and rude
When finally he found he made a misake, he refused to apologize to us
Yeah, it is meating packing and I wasn't expecting VIP treatment
But for God sake, what kind of restaurant manager will yell at a customer for something he didn't do? Even if it was our wrong, he should first check to see if it is an accident or at least ask us, rather than threaten to throw us out
Call me an arrogant New Yorker, I will never go back to that restaurant again!!!
Terrible Experience
THE BAD
For spending over $100 per person for dinner, i would think that the waiter would put my plate of food down for me instead of handing me my dish
You would think the waiter would know how to pronounce the word sorbet
You would think that you wouldn't have to ask the waiter if you can place your order
Food portions are small and i left hungry after sharing 3 appetizers and 1 entree
THE GOOD
Had our table waiting for us even though we were a little late for our reservation
The music was very fun, the decor is nice (but very dark) and our busboy/waterboy was very attentive and nice
OOOOOKAY
Let me just start by saying that I have been all over NYC to some of the hottest restarurants
With that being said i can by now definitly destinguish between the good and bad on the restaurant scene
My boyfriend and I decided to check out Buddha Bar on a random sunday night
The rest
was pretty empty so the good thing was we got promt seating
The waiter came over right away and offered us drinks and edamame, which i thought was a wierd combination considering that we did not at that point even establish if we wanted sushi
We really wanted some seaweed salad which we did not find on the menue so the waiter was kind enough to offer us the expertese of the chef
What we got was three pieces of grass nicely layed out on a lotus leaf!!!! I dont mind paying money for food but this just seemed like total direspect to the dining experience
Next we ordered the tuna tar tar which the waiter claimed would be shareable
I dont know about him but i came their hungry and wasnt sure on how to go about sharing a portion the size of a quarter (I am not kidding)
When I asked the waiter to clarify for me if the sesame tuna was close in prepartion to sashimi he babbbaled for 30min coming back to my point that in fact it was Sashimi and again the size of an appetizer compared to any other restaurant of its kind
I agree with the other reviews that the only good thing about it is the drinks the decor and the music
Hence the name BUDDHA BAR
DO NOT GO THEIR FOR FOOD you will leave with an EMPTY STOMACH and WALLET
The place is stunning
Authentic Asian touches everywhere you turn
Very good drinks
The service is just fine
The food is good (not great)
But the main draw here is the unbelievable music
The DJ rocked our world!! Techno beats with Middle Eastern/ Asian base
Totally unique and contagious
We were all dancing around the table because we couldn't stay seated
that's how good the music was
Highly recommend the place
Well my review has been way over due for 2 months
But here is my story
I waited years for the opening of this place and when I finally went in May for my birthday, I was so excited
The decor is amazing and we were greeted right away
However when I was seated, it took forever for the waiter to bring over menus and introduce himself
Our drink orders got screwed up and everything seemed to just get worse
Needless to say, my excitement slowly started to fade
I was getting so frustrated and was ready to leave when another server name Oren Davidson came over when he saw my dilemma
All I have to say is thanks to him, my Buddha Bar experience turned into an amazing one
Despite him not being my designated server, he basically took over for our inexperienced waiter the rest of the dinner
Oren made great suggestions off the menu and corrected our messed up drink order from the bar
Due to his professional, knowledgeable and courteous manner, I have returned to Buddha Bar twice since then and I make sure to have him as our waiter
Personally, I loved the food
I'm shocked no one else does based on these prior reviews
The music is also great
I believe that Oren can make anyone's experience at Buddha Bar the best it can be
Thanks Oren (if u ever read this) for makin my bday dinner an amazing one
When the doorman opened the door, the giant buddha and beautifully decorated multi-roomed facility took my breath away
The cute maitre d' made sure my party got prime seating next to the Buddha and I got to check out the hot DJ playing some of the best music I've heard in a while
I wish I could give the same rave reviews about the dinner that ensued
First of all, a manager circles the tables continuosly
it was dizzying to say the least and overbearing to boot
His supervision on the dining room floor hardly made a difference because the servers were uneducated about the menu
When our selections finally arrived, they were bland and mediocre
We should have skipped the dinner and left Buddha Bar for drinks and dancing exclusively
I have never felt compelled to review a restaurant on Citysearch until I had dinner at Buddha Bar this Saturday night
The service was terrible!! We ordered a series of appetizers for the table, including sushi
The waiter did not have any knowledge of what was in the various sushi rolls when we ordered and no idea which was which when it was served
I ordered sushi as an entree and my meal was not delivered to me until everyone else in my party had finished my meal
After enough complaining on my part, and a rather rude visit from the Restaurant Manager, my sushi dinner was comped
Buddha Bar has a great setting for drinks and I would definitely go back for that
However, I would give the restaurant another few months to work out their kinks before eating there
Went here with my parents and friends (7 of us) to celebrate my dad's 60th bday! Since they just opened, they are still working out operational issues
We were told by the restaurant to show up early even if we had a reservation
but we showed up on time, and we did have to wait 1 hr for our table
Our reservation was for 10pm
but if you go at 6-7pm (I dropped by at this time to check the place out), you should have no problem
the later you go, the busier they are (as they draw a night time scene)
I think they are still trying to gauge how long people stay at their tables
I noticed that even after people paid for their bill's they would just sit and hang out at their tables, enjoying the scene and hogging up the tables
Over time, the restaurant will get a feel for this and hopefully space out their reservations a little bit more
The Front of House staff kept apologizing to us for the delay and when we were finally seated, sent over free appetizers immediately
Food was tasty (Asian Fusion) and nicely presented, drinks and menus were brought to us right away
The staff was knowledgeable and very responsive
It seems like they are getting their act together now (compared to reviews before mine)
The execution in the dining room was on point and we never had any service or food issues
Our waiter btw was very adorable!!!  The only draw back about dining later in the evening is that the music gets increasing louder as the night progresses
Towards the end of our meal (1am) we could not hear each other speak anymore, as the volume was at clubbing caliber
(Fun though if that's what you want
not good if you plan to talk to everyone in your group)
We all did note though that the music itself was excellent and very worldly (their DJ from Paris)
In fact, my parents and their freinds were dancing a bit in their seats and we bought their CD's
Awesome space and decor that keeps you visually engaged
The doorman was friendly and actually remembered us because we had dropped by earlier to check out the place
After walking through a Buddah lined tunnel, the space separates into 3 large rooms
a bar/drinking/eating area to the left, a dining room with the DJ (on a platform) in the middle and another dining room with sushi bar (and jellyfish tanks) to the right
There are large openings between all three rooms so you can see down the length of the whole restaurant where ever you are
There is also a smoking room between the dining rooms that opens to the outside
After the sun sets, it gets pretty dark (before sunset, light streams in through the windows above)
If you expect seamless, flawless service, wait a few months to go here while they work out their operational issues (and in the meantime go to Per Se or Megu - food service perfected)

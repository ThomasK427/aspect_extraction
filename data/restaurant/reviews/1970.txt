Speaking with management proved ineffective as well, since he was indifferent to his waiter's horrendous service
If you want your waiter coming over and give you a hard time about a couple of empty seats at the table, or rushing you to order, or throwing your food on the table, or telling you to be quiet when you try to ask for the manager, and still has the nerve to charge you a fixed 20% service charge, then this is the right place for you
I've never had such bad service my my eating-out experience in NYC
The food is mediocre at best and this place does not deserve a recommendation

I have a pretty high tolerence when it comes to bad service but this place is ridiculous
The food is mediocre at best and does not deserve any recommendation
The garden was nice enough, but we found the wines by the glass poor: the Pinot Grigio was flabby and the Chianti was thin and mean
When we mentioned it to the waiter, he shrugged and asked what we expected from a glass wine
(Because it's by the glass, it has to be bad?) So we moved to a pricy half-bottle of Chianti Riserva
It was cooked (maderized), possibly due to poor storage
We changed it for a second bottle
It had the same flaw, but we kept it since it was drinkable compared to the first
The salads were fresh, but my pasta al pesto was gummy and lacked snap
My girlfriend's pizza was decent, not exceptional
For a 9
2 rating, I expect to be floored by the wine, the food and the atmosphere
I wasn't
This restaurant is really only a 5

I went for my birthday
SO DISAPPOINTED!!!! I expected it to be so good b/c it's the place for a taste of italy or whatever
SO BAD! Service was horrible but they still charged $30 because were a large group
The waiter did nothing! The food was so SALTY and not tasteful at all! And it is not that cheap
None of the entrees come with pasta and if you want pasta, it's more money
OH! and we got no free zeppolles or fruit or anything
The only thing that was nice was the atmosphere
The back dining room and the garden is very pretty
But that's about it
NOT RECOMMENDED!
Been back to this place time and time again - always good, consistent, and yummy
Order off the menu for a real treat - either the specials board or just make something up! Make sure you sit in the back - where you'll find the occasional 'Sopranos wanna-be' enjoying the ambiance
This is the best italian food we've had, and believe me, my boyfriend and I have had some pretty bad food before
We've eaten here on so many occasions, and not once have we had a bad experience or bad food
The waiters are always nice and attentive, the food is always great, and the service is pretty good, too
I went after reading about it's nice garden, the good reviews here, and after Zagat gave it a solid 21 for food
But I've never been so certain a restaurant was so bad
We were seated in the back garden, which really was a pretty setting for my girlfriend and I
The drinks list extremely limited, which ok
We ordered one of the specials our decent waiter mentioned, and one of the chicken dishes off the menu
Our dinner arrived in literally 3 minutes (my girlfriend said wow, this is faster than McDonalds), and was terrible
My dish was bland at best, and the special was even worse
The chicken couldnt be cut, the spinach went down like sawdust, the mozzeralla melted yesterday, and topped with watered down tomato sauce
My girlfriend said it best by stating I think this is the worst dinner experience weve ever had! Go elsewhere
The food here is excellent - the best fra diavolo sauce I have ever had
The seafood was excellent as well
The service was average and the tables are really close together (but who cares when the food is this good)
Bravo! Great tasting Italian food that doesn't make you look at walet every five seconds
Without the heft price tag you can sink your teeth into one of there great pizzas or speciality dishes
Try the chicken marsala, I really enjoyed it!  Please, if you are on a budget (face it will all are) and don't want to pay Babbo prices
Please go to DA NICO
Da Nico is my all-time favorite place in Little Italy
Actually it is my favorite restaurant of all time
Thank God I stumbled upon them during one of the San Gennaro festivals many years ago
I have never had a bad meal or a bad time there
One of the cheapest things on the menu is a 4 cheese ziti that it to die for
Stuffed veal chops are fantastic
The meat melts in your mouth
Lobster Fra Diavolo is always a favorite and always on the menu
Just bring a big appetite
In warmer weather, you may eat in their garden which I love to do
Reservations are a must for weekends
The only drawback is 1 of the wait staff
He always seemed stoned to me and would forget things
Otherwise, the rest of the staff was world class
You will NOT go wrong here
as soon as you go in to the Da Nicos you feel you are in defferent world, and its all about having fun, you see waiters singing, happy and very helpfull with customers
The reason that i go there is that makes feel I'm at home, however the food is excellent but can't bbet the service
Its all about having fun and good food at Da NIco's
Da Nico has it all
Great food, great waiters, and a fabulous garden area! I've eaten here numerous times and have never had a bad experience
Wine is fairly priced, and they stick to the reservation book
The best on Mulberry!!
Pizza Margherita was incredibly fresh and tasty
Soft Shell Crabs were prepared just the way I like them
One complaint, when ordering the Lobster Fra Diavolo from the special board, the waiter should have alerted us that the dish costs $42
50
The waiter, and someone at the next table, were both correct when they said that the lobster was delicious, but I though the price was a little steep
The pasta was firm all the sauces had taste, all in all a good dining experience
The earlier reviewer is correct, the bathrooms are nasty
make other arrangements
Summer weekend sidewalk tables were pleasant eating experience
this places is tres lame
long waits even if u have reservations, rude host, pushy waiters, sub-par food, and on top of all that the bathrooms are NASTY! this place needs major renovations
the bathroom is the simplest thing to keep clean
they can't even do that
don't take anyone here unless you hate them!
If you are looking for a decently priced Italian meal, this is the place to go! The food and service is excellent
I look forward to going back again and again
Everybody here gets treated like a king with all the freebies like the zeppoli's and fresh fruit for dessert
The garden in the back makes you think you are at a private home not the middle of Little Italy
The food is incredible too
Everytime I have been there, some celeberity is also dining al fresco
The waitstaff treats you so well that you do feel like Italian royalty
On our recent visit to NYC, my wife and I dined twice at Umbertos and we had a great experience both times
The service was great, the food was good and you are steps away from the entire Little Italy experience
Ask for Rad, he is one of the friendliest waiters in New York
And it is open until 4am for late dining
Thumbs up for Umbertos
Ask for GiGi, the best waiter, he usually knows what's good

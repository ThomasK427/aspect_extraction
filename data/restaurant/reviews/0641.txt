we had the best drinks from hawaii ! The hawaiin decor is amazing, with live birds and waterfall
The place got crazy fun late night, with straw hats etc
thanks for an excellent evening !
How can a group of people go to hawaii without the high airfare?
Go to Waikiki Wally's
The atmophere is great, The food is wonderful and OH my Lord the Rum drinks are incredible
Talking birds top it off
Its best to try to get a seat next to the waterfalls,so you can really feel the ambiance
The wait staff were very attentive and polite
I just went to Wally's this past Saturday night with some girlfriends and I have to say I was a little dissapointed
The food was good, but hardly worth the price
The decor was fun, albeit a little cheesy, and the service was slow, at best
There are a thousand great restaurants in this city
I'm just sorry to say Wally's isn't one of them
Don't know what happend! We had booked a large table for a large group well in advance
we had looked at the prix fixe menu (for groups)
We made it there on time but I guess the restaurant decided that it was better for us to wait over an hour for the table
The food was mediocre at best, and NOT enough food
I guess their calculations for the prix fixe were way off! The waitress was nice but the table was too big for her alone
The drinks were good though - that their 1 and ONLY plus! Not worth your $!
Average appetizer: $10
Average Main Course: $20
So if you go with a group, each person could get one appetizer and one main course for the price of the $30 Prix Fixe
We ordered the Prix Fixe
17 people paid $30 each
We received 3 appetizers and 3 main courses to split between 17 people
Not to mention the cramped surroundings, the staff that couldn't quite pull it together, and the outrageous wait despite our advance reservation
DON'T GO HERE, ever!
It's a far cry from the real Waikiki
But it's worth a crawl if you're in a dire need of mai tais and Asian-influenced meals
If you dig tikis, you'll find the kitschy decor enjoying: the waterfall, plastic palm trees, and grass huts
It's as close to a luau type of enviorment 4000 miles away from the islands
I definitely recommend going in a large group -- and drinking as many volcano drinks as you can
All in all, it's as fun as watching a rerun of Hawaii 5-0
The Scene While renovating the building, Food TV's Erica Miller discovered remnants of the Tough Club, a former speakeasy once popular with politicos and prizefighters
The timeworn wood reliefs and mirthful inscriptions decorate an otherwise modern room, where butter-soft banquettes and leather placemats befit the smartly dressed, downtown crowd
Friendly, informal servers seem rushed
The Food Though easy-on-the-eye, the daring fusion menu is hit-or-miss
Buttery pastry disks do nothing for undercooked foie gras with delightful baby artichokes, or bland, macadamia-crusted sweetbreads
Tried-and-true entrees work best, like chubby, charred NY strip with crispy fries, moist roast pork with crumbly cornbread-sausage stuffing, and wild mushroom ravioli, though the last lacked the promise of truffles
Others seem ill-conceived: rabbit is unrecognizable in tight layers of chestnut puree, spinach, and Virginia Ham, and fiery sweet potato empanada upstages a non-descript duck
I celebrated my birthday here
We were a group of 9 people and though the evening wound up going well, the planning before-hand was a pain
We were forced to choose from a pre-fixe menu that was an edited version of the whole menu and we were charged a flat rate for each course based off of the most expensive item on our menu, which left me feeling a bit ripped off
All I wanted to do was make a reservation and spend the evening with my friends, but the week before the restaurant had me figuring out a menu and making sure it was affordable for everyone
If you are going as a group be prepared to do a little work prior to going
The food was really good though, and I recommend it
We really liked this place
Everything about our experience was really good
The duck I had was some of the best(highly recommended)
The food was very very good, ambiance is nice and cozy especially if you sit downstairs
But the service was very slow
I was with a group of 9 people and they forgot my order!! Everyone was pretty much done by the time I got my dish
Make sure you are not in a rush to get anywhere
you will not be disappointed
excellent service, well-prepared food, and a strangely refreshing sense of cool compared to the usual soho/tribeca hot spots, which i'm usually partial to
This delightful new addition to Chelsea offers efficient, friendly service in a charming, wood-paneled club-like atmosphere
We were told that the restaurant was a former speakeasy
Chef Erica Miller is personable and serves up tasty American-ecclectic cuisine
The wine list is varied and reasonably priced, and they have a great selection of wines by the glass
Also recommended for weekend brunch
Two thumbs up!!
Went to Kloe last Sunday evening
Had a wonderful dinner - delicous roast salmon followed by sorbets
Nice ambience
Will definitely return
I've been to Kloe twice, once for dinner and once for just drinks
The food was amazing
The service was prompt, informed and very friendly
It's a cozy place that feels like a good refuge in the cold weather
It will be interesting to see what they do when the temperature rises
I will return without a doubt, hopefully getting the same server - he was so charming!
As a concierge, I am always seeking out satisfying dining experiences, both for my hotel guests and myself
Often times I find a restaurant that offers either amazing food OR ambience
At Kloe, you get both
The food is fresh and delicious, especially the featured item I tried
Atmospherically, the owners have really created a striking fusion of historical and contemporary New York
The ambience, service and hospitality is wonderful
They have a very sleek and comfortable lounge downstairs and the bar in the back is inviting and warm
I believe Kloe to be a well-needed addition to the Village and encourage anyone to experience it for themselves
Kloe is the perfect restaurant for me, and if you too are searching for a casual yet elegant environment with unique menu choices and top-notch service
run, don't walk, to 14th Street right now
Regulars know that it also features a great bar in a historical setting in the back (ably manned by my man Marty) and a gorgeous private room in which parties and dinners may be held
I've been there for dates, family occasions, and get-togethers with my mates
it's perfect for everything
Well, the food was pretty good
The tuna au poivre reminded us a bit of Sesso, and the veal chop though plentiful was not as tender as I would have liked
The appetizers were nice -- fois gras and the duck dumplings
So what was wrong? well, even though we made a reservation, they seated us in the basement area -- not nearly as nice as upstairs, and we felt neglected
Little things like not clearing the table of extra silverware (we were 2 people sitting at a 4 person table) seemed odd considering that Kloe aims a bit higher than Sesso
I live in the neighborhood and decided to give Kloe a try
It was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while
The food was outstanding and not too expensive and the service is friendly and knowledgable
really nice decor and ambience as well, this is a great date place
Kloe is a very nice looking place, but the food and service pale in comparison to the decor
At best, the food is average, and so was the service when I went (the waiter forgot my appetizer and gave me the wrong drink)
Also, the restaurant seems to have very few tables for two - and all of those tables seem located in awkward spaces (in a cubby hole, in the middle of the aisle, right by the kitchen door(!))
I wouln't go back
Instead, I'd go across the street to Crispo, which is much much better
After reading some of the ratings on City Search for this newly opened restaurant, ranting and raving about how good it is I figured I must give it a go

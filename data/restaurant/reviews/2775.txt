The PIZZA is by far the best I have ever tasted
I have tasted them all
It is a pleasure to see that someone still cares and takes pride in true old world tradition of pizza making
I remember Grandma making the Square Pie with the same love and attention to detail and pefection that Domenico does
The only draw back is the lack of parking! and the second is the unbelievable wait
patience is not one of my virtues when it comes to this PIZZA
I am like a kid on Christmas not being able to wait to open my gifts
I grew up in the neighborhood where Dom had his Pizza store
I rememner when a quarter paid for a slice and a small soda
I no longer live in that neighborhood but when I'm there I MUST have the pizza from DiFara
It tastes the same as it did in the 1960's
DiFara is much better than the old fruit stand that was there before
Keep up the great taste
It better and different from any pizza you have ever had
Forget about Grimaldi's Brooklyns best pizza, and as a matter of fact the worlds best, is on Avenue J
Di Fara pizza is excellent, oily, and with the perfect cheese
Be sure to try the fresh buffalo mozzerala pie (it isnt on the menu) which is far better than anything (anything!) Ive ever tasted
Worth the trip from wherever you are
!
So I walk into this hole-in-the-wall place on a rainy Thursday evening, tired from working a long day in the city
And here is this old Italian guy who tells me to pay $2 for a slice when everyone else charges $1
50 but I am so hungry and in a mood for pizza, I decide what the hell, let me try it
And
mamma mia, what a pizza! I have been licing in NY for 13 years but have not anything like that before
The crust is perfectly thin, the flavors burst out, the sauce is just the right mix of spices and sweetness and the cheese
I have to stop since I am salivating
This pizza is out of this world!!!
I live in the city, but decided on a lazy Saturday to jump on the Q to check this place out, I highly recommend it it's probably the best pizza I've had anywhere
Amazingly tasty cheese drenched in oil and soft yet crisp perfect dough, who could ask for more?  Tip: this area is extremely Jewish, so most places are closed on a Saturday, if you want to check out the neighborhood it might be better to pick another day
Unfortunately, I learned of this place too late for my mega-pizza eating days
He roasts tomatoes in the oven to make his fantastic sauce
The cheese he uses is from a different distributor than 98% of all the other places
The cheese distributor allows this because they know
HE'S THE BEST!
I live in Bay Ridge and decided to take a bus ride (changing buses along the way) to DiFara's on Avenue J
BELIEVE THE HYPE! Incongrously located in an Orthodox Jewish area, surrounded by Kosher eateries, DiFara's was the only business open the first Saturday I visited
The place is owned by a REAL Italian guy who appears to be the only employee
He prepares ALL ingrediants from scratch, growing basil and other herbs right behind the counter
It may take a little longer than other Pizzerias, but when you take your first mouth-watering bite, YOU WILL BE CONVERTED to the Church of DiFara
I've lived in New York for almost 20 years eating pizza regularly
But Di Fara is by far THE BEST PIZZA you're get in New York
It was purely by acident that one of my colleague lived in the area and ordered a square pie one night
Talk about flavor that just burst!!! Forget John's and Lombardi's leave that pizzaria to the yuppies and wanna-be's
Just keep in mind the place is a real hole in the wall
So not for the first date
I have a love hate relationship with them
They are cheap and good but they make a lot of mistakes
The bagels are really good, especially when they just came out of the oven
The coffee is decent too, well when they remember to clean the machines
For awhile it had that tin taste to it
I love this place for cheap simple things like eggs and cheese on a bagel
Anything more complicated seems to come out wrong
I think most of the staffs English isnt that good and causes miscommunications and mistakes
They also make a mean tuna melt and some fine smoothies
Dont order the large iced coffee or smoothie unless you are a family of 4, their large is basically a popcorn bucket with a straw in it
Its more liquid then any one person should consume in a single day
I am a native Texan (and of Scottish descent to top it off), my boyfriend,however, is an Italian from Brooklyn
He introduced me to this place because his whole family shops there
It is the BEST fresh bread I have ever had! Mazzola should be #1 on the list of bakeries, for sure!
This place is heaven, esp
if you catch the bread coming out from the oven
The cheese bread and the chocolate bread will blow your mind
I'm addicted
The Scene Sweet Melissa, named after the omnipresent Allman Brothers song, is a welcome and casual addition to the hopping Court Street restaurant scene
In summer, the small outdoor garden is an ideal place to sip coffee while reading under a canopy of trees and sky
The Food Owner Melissa Murphy Hagenbart rolls out an impressive lineup of sweet treats such as kiwi and blueberry tarts, linzer tarts, cookies and puddings
Afternoon tea service runs from 1pm to 5pm
There's even a nice menu of savory items served during late lunch and dinner hours
Sometimes the word cramped means comfy
That's how it felt inside this place
I have had nothing but a wonderful time everytime
The restaurant features country decor in an intimate setting
The waiter was pleasant and attentive
I had afternoon tea which featured a pot of tea and several pastries and tea sandwiches, all of which were delicious
It is a small space, so I would recommend going during off-peak hours, but it's worth visiting if you're in the neighborhood
Sweet melissa's is a sweet treat, and a relaxing place to spend a sunday out
Although the seating arrangments are quite cramped they make up for that in great desserts and food
I myself have been there quite a number of times
But i must say, their service can sometimes be slow or rude
But hey, it can't be all good!
This place is adorable
The food is great, it is a cute little romantice place, great for Sunday afternoons
I wouldn't go if i were in a hurry, but it is a wonderful place to savory the day
The outdoor garden is just wonderful, and the service, though a little slow is friendly and easy going
I have been a number of times and each time left in a better mood than when I arrived
:)
Seating inside is cramped to say the least
They offered table service but perhaps should train their servers to provide service
Both coffees came cold took quite a while to get replacements
A repeat visit is doubtful
My boyfriend and I love the food at Sweet Melissa
However the staff is something else
One gentleman ignored us most of the time and would plunk the coffee down and spill it on the table without saying a word
We couldn't figure out why he was so nasty! We even heard the people next to us complaining to each other
Although Sweet Melissa's food and pastries are very tasty, the unfriendly folks who work there sour the experience
I have been there a few times and it seems as though the staff is perpetually unhappy, lacking manners, and not friendly at all
If you don't mind interacting with sour-puss employees, then by all means, enjoy the treats at Sweet Melissa
Even though there are many great places for pastry/baked goods in this neighborhood, Sweet Melissa still manages to stand out
It's the nicest place to nurse a cup of coffee (and the coffee is good), especially out in the little back garden
Also the savory muffins and chocolate macaroons are amazing

Lobo is what it is
A fun spot with good prices, good food, and great margaritas
Don't expect anything more that that and this will be one of your neighborhood favorites
It is one of mine
I eat at Lobo about once a week either with friends of just by myself at the bar
The staff are really fun and give great service especially when in comes to substitutions
I am not from Texas but if the food is as good in Texas as it is at Lobo I cannot wait to go
The problem with the previous review is thst he grew up in the southwest that is not Tex-Mex
Lobo has the best and only Tex-Mex in NYC do not just take my word check out NY Press best of this year
I eat there all the time and the food is always excellent
People come from all over the city and even from Texas to have there famous Margaritas and at $8 for a 17oz drink made with 100% agave tequila it is a bargain
If you want Tex-Mex this is the only place to go
Growing up in the southwest I know my tex mex
The food here is decent, it's edible at best, but nothing about it is authentic and you don't crave it after you leave
The drinks are weak overpriced, so save your money
The tamales are dry and the chicken tacos are mediocre
However, I did enjoy the caldo de pollo (chicken soup mexican style) and the fajita salad
The guacamole is pretty good, considering noone knows how to make it out here
Overall, this place is average with above average prices
-For a 'tequila bar' you would expect to be given a tequila menu
Nope
-For $8 margaritas touted to be the best you'd expect more than well tequila and cheap mixer in a small glass
Nope
-For hard shell tacos you'd expect them to be fully prepared with fixins
Nope
-For taco beef you'd expect some seasoning
Nope
-For a small restaurant that isn't too busy you'd expect a water refill
Nope
-For a great dining experience will I go back to Lobo? Nope
As a Mexican living in the New York area, I have a hobby of trying Mexican restaurants in the city, searching for authentic food
I am so happy that I found lobo
We sat at the bar and my date happened to be a vegetarian so we asked the bartender for some suggestions, he made some great suggestions on how they'd alter meat dishes to be vegetarian friendly and what they came up with was just amazing
I had the shrimp fajitas which were full of flavour and a very generous portion
But the best was definitely the margaritas just so tasty and refreshing
After a couple of rounds the bartender offered to buy us a shot of tequila, he suggested their homemade ancho chili tequila
Wow I cannot explain it you just have to go there and try it for yourself
I sincerely (and have) recommended Lobo
The enchiladas and tacos are great! The enchiladas have a lot of cheese and flavor
It is tex-mex so there is more chilli than standard mexican food
The beer on tap is served in a huge thick beer glass, which is fun! The atmosphere is pleasant with lots of western decor and great servers
The free chips and salsa is always a plus too!
Lobo is absolutely outstanding! I crave their Chicken fajitas and queso dip every week! The margaritas are amazing! Citysearch even named them 2nd place in 2004 for best margaritas! They said Tex-Mex that'll satisfy wolfish appetites--and some of the best margaritas in the area
The staff is absolutely fantastic and fun! The owners made an effort to introduce themselves, and since have always made sure to come over and say hello whenever I am there
They always remember my friends the next time we come back too
The food is sensational, and the brunch is amazing
For some crazy reason their bacon during brunch is the best bacon I have ever had! Plus how can you go wrong when chocolate chip pancakes are on the menu? Mmm!!!! I go there to eat dinner, brunch, or to just drink and hang out at the bar with the friendly staff
Highly recommended!!!
Eaten here a few times and always thought it was okay
It's not amazing, nor is it cheap, but then again there really aren't that many great Tex-Mex places around Bklyn
It is pretty unfortunate because this place has pretty decent food, but the staff is so incredibly aweful
There demeanor is gruff and sarcastic and completely unfriendly! I recommend you never ever order food from them to your home - THEY ALWAY MESS UP THE ORDER
The house salad - the lettuce is always so dark and aged
They are unhelpful in substitutions, like no hot peppers and or adding cheese
They charge you for each additional add on
I will be honest, Brooklyn is missing a real jem of a Mexican restaurant - which is needed in our neighborhood
By the way - the Margharitas are just soso
nothing to write home about! Sorry it is much better to learn how to cook your own food at home than waste your money here!
The key to enjoying Lobo is -- surprisingly -- going for brunch
They've got a thick-cut brioche French toast that's classically perfect, served with grade-A syrup
And the breakfast tacos transcend expectations
They've got a touch of heat and a pile of flavor -- a wonderful savory breakfast
For dinner, Lobo is passable, but not spectacular
For brunch: Rarely crowded, consistently great
While I am not a chef, or from Texas, I do think this place is excellent
And I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant
I live in the neighborhood and Lobo is usually my choice for a drink, or a casual group dinner or nights when spending $60 on dinner for two is out of the question
Its a super cozy, friendly place with a very welcoming staff and laid back feeling
The margaritas are really good, especially the ones made with the flavored tequilas (I like the ginger)
The beef fajitas are my favorite and I usually start with the spicy chicken soup
I find all the dishes very flavorful and the service to be friendly, fun and attentive
And you get a lot of food for the price!
Okay, I am obsessed
I absolutely love this restaurant - to hang inside at the bar or if the weather is nice, the backyard is amazing too
I can't get enough of chips w/ Georgia's Bean Dip (I swear, I dream about it at night) and the fajitas and soft tacos
There are enough options to cater to non-spicy food people like me, as well as those that like it hot hot hot
This place actually makes the commute from Manhattan worth it - sometimes twice in the same week!
If you review this place or if you have been there and were disappointed in the Mexican food it is because it is Tex Mex cuisine
That being said it made my taste buds stop missing Texas so much as I felt like I was back home with an El Arroyo style patio, cheap queso and salty Ritas
Great combo platters with heart-stopping, or at least clogging enchiladas and refried beans
this place has a decent margarita, and a cool outside area going for it, but could use an upgrade in the service department
Still its a good spot with good chicken enchiladas
We just visited Lobo recently and were so impressed with the authenticity of the Tex Mex cuisine
The flavors are great, the relaxed environment is fun and easy
and the margaritas are terrific
We highly recommend sitting in the garden and enjoying some wonderful food and drinks
We especially loved the Sassy enchiladas and the extremely flavorful bbq ribs
If you have spent any time in Texas, you will recognize Lobo as the real thing
NYC has until now been sorely lacking authentic Tex-Mex food, so thank heavens for these people
The service is super-friendly and the margaritas are terrific, great for washing down Lobo's spot-on chilli con queso (which transplanted Texans know is hard to find in this city!) Definitely worth a quick trip to Brooklyn on the F train
If you don't like it, then you don't know Tex-Mex!
This was the best Tex-Mex Food outside of Texas I have ever had
The food is authentic and has excellent flavor
The margaritas are out of this world they are made with fresh juices and premium tequila
They also have kept the same brunch from Harvest and added a few Tex-Mex specialties
If you have not been here yet get there as soon as possible
I recently ate at the bar at LOBO and really enjoyed the drinks, food and the people
This is true Tex Mex! The margaritas are delicious and refreshing, the best I ever had
I ate the beef fajitas and they were so tasty, the perfect blend of spicy and flavorful
They were served with plenty of sides and tortillas

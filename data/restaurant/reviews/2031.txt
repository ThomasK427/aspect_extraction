I think the cupcakes here are to die for! I also tried the banana pudding which was great
Can't wait to go back and try their red velvet cake!
The cupcakes are reliably good, but the cakes, while they look nice, are hit and miss
The legend lives on, but the reality is wildly erratic
After post-poning our vacation to NY after 9
11, my mother and I went in March and made a special trip to Magnolia Bakery
All we wanted to do was bring some of the most delicious cupcakes back home with us
The snobby counterhelp snapped at us when we asked for one of the desserts behind the counter (we were informed that is NOT how they do business), and snapped at us again when we asked for a cookbook
It was a Monday morning, so the place was empty
You would have thought she could have been more pleasant
That experience left us with a very sour opinion of the Magnolia Bakery, and needless to say, we left with nothing
A Village favorite, Magnolia's got a pleasant staff and a wicked sense of cake decoration
Flavors vary, but cupcakes are usually a pleasure and red-devil cake is a standout
As for the rest, you've got to go to know
In Short Everything's up-to-date on neon-flecked Christopher Street, but inside McNulty's Tea
If you like strong coffee, buy some Douwe Egberts dark roast here
Being from the Netherlands myself I am probably biased, but this is really the best coffee: even when using a lot of it, the coffee remains smooth, not bitter, with a very full taste
I live in Japan, but whenever I visit NYC, I always visit this store
I just love everything about them
selection, owner, services
hope everybody visit them feel the same way I do
Please enjoy their special teas and coffee
This place reminds me a lot of Curry Curry in the 30s near Lex
Similar name and menu
And both have the best tikka masala sauces ever! Other dishes are also very good
Yes, the place is a dump but if you stick to takeout or delivery, this place can't be beat
the place looks like a dirty closet, but the smell is what lured me in
i took a menu and am now obsessed
they have some of the best chicken tikka masala i've ever had
quick and cheap
great order in place
Some of the best food in the city can be found in holes in the wall
Unfortunately, so can some of the worst
The food is almost as unimaginative as the name
The tikka masala was bland and runny, the nan was not really nan and the meat was dubious
Even the rice was sub-par
With so much tasty Indian food in this town, it would be best to avoid this place
their chicken tikka masala is to-die-for
sure, the place looks like a dump but the food is so good, who cares
i order from here all the time - i don't even know if you can eat at the restaurant since it's so small
cheap yummy - what more can you ask for?
The setting is perfect with the outdoor seating the quaint cozy spot right on that great turn to Bethune Street
However the food is so blah boring, I do recognize it's a diner, but I could have made this stuff
my linguini bolognase was very very thick spaghetti with hamburger meat
It was disappointing
Plus cash only, isn't the most convienent and the wait staff could be better informed quicker
This place has so much potential that it is not exploiting
I love this place for breakfast
Go early and sit in a big booth and order anything from pancakes to omelettes
In the summer, the outdoor seating works too
For the price and location, this is really a great pick
The Bus Stop is an excellent place for some one on a budget in NYC
A friend and I recently visited NY and on the recommendation of a pal we ate at the Bus Stop for breakfast - we wound up eating there every day for breakfast! The service was excellent, the food delicious, lovely neighborhood atmosphere, and very reasonable prices
Highly recomended
Comfort food means starch to me and there's no shortage of potatoes on this menu
But while eggs and hashbrowns or meatloaf and mashed are served in a straightforward, no-nonsense fashion, the big surprise at Bus Stop is the salad selection
Forsaking iceburg lettuce with the requisite tomato slices and a handful of crotons, this neighborhood diner has a number of options when it comes to getting your daily greens
The Happy Waitress Salad loaded as it is with beets and bacon is my favorite
Outdoor seating make this a nice place to hit when the weather is right; if it's really hot out take a seat next to the windows--they open onto the street and you'll get a nice view from shaded confines
I dig the big Greek salads
This place has a diner-y atmosphere, but the outdoor seating makes it feel a little more special
This is absolutely the best place in NYC to have Sunday brunch
My friends and I eat here every chance we get
All you can drink Mimosa's and Champagne for $12
95??? That's unheard of in NYC, but not at Artepasta
The food is spectacular and the waiters are phenomenal, so is the service
I waited for a table for an hour both times after having a reservation
The food took very long to come out and it was difficult to grab the attention of our server on many occasions
There was on instance where our server came to our table 45 minutes after she took our order stating that she long the sheet she wrote the order on
I could be wrong but wouldn't you realize that right away, or shortly after when trying to put the order in to the kitchen in the first place? She offered to discount the bill due to the mistake but when the bill came out there was no discount and felt very uncomfortable readdressing the offer
I can not say this is a consistent problem so I still recommend the rest
Hopefully my next experience will be more pleasant
Once again I went back to Artepasta for their free-flowing Champagne Brunch, the only of its type in town, with awesome food, at great prices, and very friendly service
They're very accomodating to large groups, and the eggs benedict and Steak Eggs are yummmy!!!
Not only is the food delicious and fresh, Artepasta has the friendliest service I have encountered in NYC
The homemade pasta was perfect in a pomodoro sauce (made to order for me) and the caesar salad was good
Three-course dinner with wine, tax and tip was $36
Prett amazing
Artepasta is a great
The restaurant is cute, food is good and very inexpensive
Brunch is fabulous, unlimited mimosas and a great fixe brunch menu
Highly recommend!
The best brunch in NYC, hands-down!!! The food and service is spectacular
Artepasta's fabulous! The food is excellent, the restaurant is charming, and the prices are extremely reasonable
Who'd want anything else from their local Italian restaurant?
Arte Pasta offers great home made pasta
It is cozy and inexpensive
Simply stated: Large group of friends, inexpensive menu, good food, warm and pleasant atmosphere equals a great time for everyone! Though we normally don't venture into the west village, this place was a great find
It's good for large groups or just two people; its cozy and unpretentious
They advertise a prix fixe from 4pm-7pm, though the regular menu has great selections too
Everything was well made and the portions are filling
Recommended: calimari appetizer or any pasta dish
Attention: might take you a second to realize which is actually their real entrance, cuz there are other 'doors' but they dont open
Sure they are! Yummy West Village italian eatery on the famed Greenwich Ave
strip
Dimly lit by candlelight, painted walls, and wooden floors make this a cozy dining experience and romantic date spot
We started with some cornmeal crusted calamari and a $20 bottle of Australian chardonay; both were quite nice
I had smoked mozzarella ravioli which was too smoky for my taste, but the sauce was delicious
My date enjoyed the special pasta; farfalle with sausage and brocoli rabe
Lemon sorbet and hazelnut gelato - both excellent - finished off our meal

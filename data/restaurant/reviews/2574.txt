After leaving a 15% tip for a table of two, we were told to lay 20% down for a tip
somewhat sketchy
This place is like a bland Thai restaurant
The food was not spicy or flavorful enough and one dish we had with shrimp had an awful sweet sauce that was like something out of a jar in the supermarket
There are much better places for exotic Asian dishes
Excellent food
Worth every cent you pay at this very affordable restaurant
Good ambience, very good service coupled with melodious exotic music that will jumpstart your dining experience
If you are not familiar with Indonesian food go for the thali
Its like a platter which allows you to taste a bit of everything
It cost 17$ and it comes with wine and desert
There's a thali for veg and non veg category
this place is definitely a bargain
the ambiance is nice but not fancy
the service is super attentive and very friendly
and the prices are considerably cheap considering how good the food is
i particularly recommend the fish -- the snapper is quite delicious! and yes, the house wine is also surprisingly drinkable for the price
So, this meal was exceptionally yummy and light
The portions were just the right size so I was just the right amount of full when I finished the meal
The house wine is better than most, which was a pleasant surprise
The staff is exceptionally attentive and nice - lots of smiles and instantly refilled water glasses
I'd definitely suggest this place!
This little gem has been on 9th Ave
before it became trendy
Started on a shoestring, it has consistently served great food (try the tasting menu!) at a decent price
When out of towners visit me in Hell's Kitchen, Bali Nusa Inda is the first neighborhood restaurant I recommend
Gentle, efficient service, hearty fare, and lots of dishes with ingredients I love, such as spicy peanut sauce and tofu, which I appreciate as a vegetarian
No alcohol is served, but I bet they would let you bring your own
You don't really find many Indonesian restaurants, and this is a really good one
The people are friendly, and the food is delicious -- pretty big portions too
Try the traditional nasi goreng (fried rice), which is full of vegatables, shrimp and chicken
Great food and very affordable! We had the shrimp corn fritters and stuffed squid to start and then had the lamb curry and stir-fried shrimp with mixed veggies
The last dish was average but the rest were outstanding!
Tried their beef satay during the International Food Street Fair and was hooked
Nicely barbequed beef with a great peanut satay sauce
Went back for dinner and tried a sampler - which was okay
Went back another time and tried numerous appetizers - all which were very good
Will be going back again to try some of the main dishes
Recommended by 2 friends, I took best friend there for bday dinner with other friends
The dishes were salty (lobster pasta and veal/eggplant, and chicken parmigiano)
Portion is big but again, just too salty
And there's not much greeting from the server when we came in or when we were eating
It took a long time for our entrees (6 people)
I don't think I'd return again
Wait was longer than advertised, food was bland - had lobster ravioli and fettucine alfredo
Alfredo was very thing, no crushed pepper or cheese offered
Shrimp in the appetizer was stringy
Took forever to get a Diet Coke - when it came it was flat and not flavored
Bread service was never offered, though we repeatedly saw waiters carrying the baskets around
Can get better food and service at the Olive Garden for half the price
At first I thought they were just trying to rush my dinner by bringing out my entree 90 seconds after my appetizer but then, when they never came back to clean off our dishes, I realized they were just disorganized
Eventually I was able to signal someone that we wanted our check
They covered for their incompetence by adding 18% gratuity to the check
There are too many other restaurants in New York to go back to this one
The lobster ravioli is the BEST I've ever had
They were happy to substitute the cream sauce for red
The ravioli had HUNKS of real lobster in it and it was delicious! All the ingredients were fresh and I would definitely return for a good italian meal
two couples went pre restaurant
4 meals ordered with two appetizers
all was good
service was prompt, portions plentiful, food delicious
The food and service was average (pasta over cooked)
The problems started when I attempted to pay the check
My bill was for $25
96 I had a $50 Amex Gift Cheque made out and signed, I was told they do not accept gift cheques, after a bit of an arguement I was told that I should have let them know that I had a gift cheque and to pay the bill by credit card
The owner came over and told me he would accept a $25 gift cheque not the $50 one because he would have to give me change and that this is not a bank
Very poor answer, next day I called Amex and they cashed my cheque which was made out to L' Allegria and they have contacted the restaurant regarding this issue
The owner and staff need to learn customer service to say the least
This is a cute little Italian restaurant, and they serve good food with good service
The friend calamari appetizer was quite good, and the ricotta cheesecake was great
The veal dish was good, and while definitely enjoyable, the appetizers and desserts did outshine it
Overall, the food is reasonably priced, but it is pretty easy to run of a large bill with wine and mineral water
For $24, you can get a prix fixe dinner, which is a great deal
While a nice find, this place lacks the greatness of a few other Italian restaurants in the city
It is definitely good for a pre-theater dinner, and for local diners
If in the area, give it a try
If you're not in the area, try one of the other fine restaurants that New York City has to offer
L'allegria has an excellent Italian Menu, Great atrmosphere and best of all, close to the Theatre District
The wait staff is friendly and helpful
I recommend this restaurant to all those looking for a tasty Italian cuisine moderately priced
I was very excited to try this very cute and reasonably-priced Italian restaurant
My experience there was very disappointing
First of all, don't sit in the front of the restaurant
The windows are not properly sealed and I froze through the entire bad dining experience
I had two different dishes - the first one was so bad I had to send it back and the second one was just a bland and awful
The only good thing about the restaurant was the service, and even that wasn't stellar
I DO NOT recommend this restaurant
great food, great service, easy to get a table and great prices
I used to really like it here -- but after dinner last night, I doubt whether I'll return
Not too crowded, but had to wait forty-five minutes for our entrees
People at the next table came in fifteen minutes after us, but were served before us
Pasta I had was decent (agnolotti with lamb), but the portion was so small it was laughable
Not sure what happened here, but I miss the Pietrasanta of a few years ago
I would not recommend this place for italian food
It does not appear to be authentic italian cuisine but an experimentation of italian style
Worst of all the pasta that I ordered with clams came with 7 large clams that were tough and chewy, were in the shell, and the whole dish was so saltly that it was inedible
Rather than create a scene with my friends and send the dish back I just didn't eat it
This was definitely not worth the $35 I paid for dinner
My italian mother recommends le tre venezie instead and she never likes italian restaurants when she can prepare a better meal at hom
I've been coming to this restaurant for nearly 12 years, since I found out the owners are the same folks who own my verry favority NYC restaurant, Pietrasanta (up the street at 47th)

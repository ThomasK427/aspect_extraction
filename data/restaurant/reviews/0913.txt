well it was!!!, food was delicious, great music, service was great
After dinner we decided to move over to the bar and have some drinks
The bartender made us the best drinks which included Mango Mojitos and Margaritas
We had so much fun
Next day I woke up feeling great after some very satisfying dinner and best drinks in the city
my friends and I can't wait to go back!!!
keep up the good work Yuca Bar!!!!
Friends and I arrived
thinking we were in for a treat at this restaurant
how wrong we were! The waiter
a jerk
uninterested in serving us
Not busy the waiter was just walking and talking to the hostess
After sitting ten minutes
the adjoining table (who arrived after us) was given menus, specials, drinks and appetizers before us
We needed to bring to the managers attention how UTTERLY uninterested in our waiter was
We needed to tell the hostess that our drinks were sitting at the bar
To make matters worse there was no apology
I will
by all means pass the word how horrible this waiter was
I work in a firm that employs over 30 thousand employees and I tell you
working in the HR division gives me quite the voice to say how horrible this experience was
I recommend that any one intereted in a good service go elsewhere
Good luck Yuca Bar!
Been here twice and will keep on coming
the happy hour on Fridays
you can go wrong with $5 sangria!!! A Mimosa is a Mimosa, but with a black corn enpanada it is not the same! I hate the goat cheese one
The lobster meat quesadillas are delicious and the churrasco steak it is very juicy, but can do with a bit more flavor
The ceviche is not what a ceviche really is but the sweet mango taste to it and the advocados it sure makes it a trade mark
LOVE IT!
I've been to Yuca several times with friends for drinks
The wait staff are very nice and the drinks tasty (although way too strong)
But each time the bartender was arrogant and nasty
Last time, it was so bad that my friend commented on what a sour person he was and how he was ruining what should have been a pleasant experience (place has nice ambience)
After this, I have vowed never to return
If Yuca ditched this guy, I'd highly recommend the place
Otherwise, I'd say skip it and go somewhere else
I went out with a couple of friends to celebrate a birthday not knowing were to go, and we end up at yuca bar, a pleasent discovery
The sangria and mango mojito are a must, we have some tapas which were very original and tasty
Service was excellent, and when we receive the bill, i was very pleased; i will defenetly come back for some mojitos in the out doors
I finally tried this spot after my grief over the demise of Leshko's finally faded
But I think Yuca has done a great job filling those shoes
I went through twice this weekend and had a great experience both times!!!  The brunch Saturday was fantastic, my breakfast burrito was delish, the accompanying salad had great ingredients, and my friend's french friend an unusual blend of fry meets ring
Good stuff
The margaritas, however, left a little to be desired, unfortunately, but they were understanding in remaking it to my liking
The next time was around dinner (mind they don't serve the main menu till 6) and the tapas were fantastic
Be sure to try the tuna ceviche and the quesadilla
Great Sangria was fresh fruit in the pitcher for 22 bucks
good deal
place cleared out by 1 and drew an interesting mix of true village hip and those that wanted to be
I would go back on a nice summer nite
The ambience, location and price are great
It does appear that they are not used to having large groups
We were around 6 in total for brunch, most other patrons were 2 or 3 pp groups
The 2 -3 pp groups received their food very quickly
We had to continue asking for ours
Other people were coming in after us and leaving before us
They need to get better service!
I went with a friend and the service was excellent, as well as the appetizers
Try the Coconut Shimps and empanadas!! We also had dinner but it didn't measure up after the appetizers
But definitely price is not an issue here
I cannot stop going to this restaurant
I went 2 nights in a row last weekend, once with the boyfriend and once with the girls - everybody dug it as much as I did! We especially loved the mini lobster soft shell tacos, the glazed shrimp and the octopus ceviche! Not to mention the delicious Malbec wine
The atmosphere is so warm and inviting and the service is fabulous, that I always end up lounging there for hours chatting, eating and sipping wine
Wait, maybe I should be keeping this my little secret, forget I said anything!
I'm suddenly obsessed with this place - and that is no easy feat
I came here for a birthday, and it was fabulous
The food was delicious - some incredibly innovative and other dishes perfectly simple
The drinks were delish, and the service couldn't have been nicer or more attentive
And after two hours and plentiful amounts of alcohol, the bill was a pleasingly palatable as the meal
I would recommend this place to anyone - and I'll be going back for seconds!
My lady and I were at Yuca last week for the first time
This meal my friends was one of the most satisfying, sultry, and tasty adventures my mouth has ever had the pleasure to excursion upon
We had 3 apps - cheeses, specially prepared corn on the cob, olives, and 2 bowls of unusual soups
All were dirt cheap, elegant and superb
The entres were equally delightful
They have some great vegan ones, too
Portions are good
We enjoyed a LARGE pitcher of tangy quenching sangria
Friends, I heartily insist that you frequent this beautiful establishment
The service is excellent, the ambiance is stellar, the banquet cannot be bested, and the prices are prodigal
In Short The interior features flickering candles in white paper lanterns, hand-painted murals on distressed brick and oversized wood booths
Vietnamese dishes include quick-seared flank steak, tangled with garlicky watercress; crispy calamari, enlivened with jalapeno slivers; and chicken curry with daikon and handfuls of fresh herbs
Some standards, like shrimp spring rolls and noodle soups are popular
Bao Noodles has the look of a whole-in-the-wall, quaint restaurant with nice service and a delectable menu, that is until I actually sat down and tried some of their dishes
The interior of the restaurant is dark and small, very intimate for the average date and limited for groups of 8 or more
The service was decent, but could have been better as they neglected our group one too many times
Most people don't come here for the ambiance or for the service, I would think the food takes prescedence over all -- and how disappointed I was to try it
The Pork on Rice Vermacelli was disappointing, lacking in flavor and the portions were smaller than most Vietnamese places I've been to
Banh Mi (sandwiches) were okay, but also somewhat plain as well
I sampled other dishes around the table, salt and peppered squid, sauteed beef, and oxtail soup all had something in common: bland in taste
I find this place to be a poor substitute for the cheaper, faster service, and better tasting food of the Viet restaurants in Chinatown and around the city
I've been going to bao noodles about twice a month since it has opened
I love this place
They have killer cocktails and the best pho I have ever eaten
I can't really tell you about the other menu items because every time I go there, I only order the Pho Bo Kho
It tastes amazing
The beef is so tender and the broth is so good
Not too salty
Not too bland

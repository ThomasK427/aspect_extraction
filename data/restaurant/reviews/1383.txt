One of the most beautirul restaurant in the UES
Exellente food and frendly service
Highly Recommended
I am a big fan of Le Singe Vert, so I had to try Rouge - I was not disapointed
The food was great and the service was nice
in a french way ;-) The Hostess (manager?) was very nice and accomodating
The out door cafe was perfect and the interior was charming
I highly recommend it!  I had the Sweat breads - they were cooked to perfection and the portion was large
Suprising, since specialty meats are usually doled out miserly
I also had the Foie Gras, (sounds likes the beginnings of an offal night ;-) and it was  tender, and delectable
My date had the Tuna Tartar that was well portioned and exacuted
Twas a beautiful day when we decided to go to Cercle Rouge
I'll admit the wait staff was very helpful to accomodate our large party
However, that is the only good thing I can say about the restaurant
My friend who is a vegetarian found nothing to eat on the menu, except a caesar salad, which she chose after asking the head waiter if the chef could cook some vegetables up for her and was quickly turned down
They brought her salad out with anchovies on it
We also ordered a cheese plate which had 3 tiny pieces of cheese
When we asked why the portions were so small, he pointed out that there was fruit as well on the plate (there were two berries only!)
In summation, Food was Awful and Overpriced
Waitstaff was uncreative and not so helpful
There are definitely better places down the block!
Wow, I dunno what day that other reviewer went but mine and wife's experience was much different
We were walking around and I saw the awning that said it was a French resturant so I had to go look
The menu looked good so me and the wife decided to have lunch, and let me tell you how incredible everything was
First off the staff was very nice
Our orders were taken promptly and we watched the servers dance to the music
I had the French-style Philly cheese steak and the wife had the lobster roll
Everything was made to perfection and was delicious
Oh, get the mousse! The prices were also extremely reasonable
Don't go to this restaurant! The food was terrible and the manager was beyond offesive
My soggy asparagus was the first clue
For entrees, my friend ordered the seafood bouillabaisse and I ordered a steak
The bouillabaisse came out smelling fishy, so my friend sent it back
When the manager came over, he accused my friend of offending the chef and continued to argue with her about the dish
As my co-worker said, we should have just walked out the instant the manager took that tone
Instead, we finished our wine and when the courtesy desserts came out our impression was solidified
The lemon tart was runny, the mousse was like Swiss Miss pudding, the blueberries were freezer-burned and the sauce on the cream puffs tasted like Hersey's syrup
It was a horrible experience and the manager, Robert, should be fired and never be hired in NYC again!
I went here with a group of friends and had a great meal in an unexpected place
I didn't know anything about the restaurant, but when we arrived, I liked the setup immediately
It has a chic vibe and we had a drink at the bar before dinner
The waitstaff was friendly and attentive
We had a nine-course meal that was filled with a variety of foods that all worked together
The wings were an unusual addition in a French bistro but maybe the best I've had anywhere
The other dishes, tuna and fois gras were fantastic
We were able to have conversation without shouting over the noise - it was a very comfortable setting
I would definitely recommend Cercle Rouge for the great food and good atmosphere
Went here for brunch and it was awful! Service was slow and it took them 90 minutes just to prepare eggs
The waiter kept avoiding our table or any eye contact because he was actually embarrassed by how long the kitchen was taking
Several other tables were also complaining and left right away
My chorizo and eggs should have been advertised as potatoes and eggs, because that's all it was
The amount of chorizo I got amounted to 1 inch worth of sausage
The crab benedict had no crabmeat
I think only one burner was working and they must have a problem with their food supplier because there is no way any restaurant can operate like that
I went there last weekend and had a great time
The food was delicious and the ambience was very sexy
The staff was extremely nice
Awesome place!!
Cercle Rouge was such a wonderful experience in so many ways
I have been here twice and both times were amazing
The food is wonderful especially the chicken wings the Fois Gras - never have I had Fois Gras that is so fabulous
Once we had wine pairings which was fun and once we chose our own wine - both were wonderful
The food is truly over the top and the experience is worth every penny
I live in Tribeca and I am very happy we have now a great French Bistrot around
When first opened I had the highest of hopes
Great locale and live set up
Sit outside and enjoy the scenery, tuck yourself in back for intimacy, find a spot at the bar to eat and imbibe
Wings? Capricious yet outstanding
Lamb was also on, but service flawed, menu lacked depth
Returned to find same great set up but vastly improved menu
Snapper was aces, my wife(so fussy) raved over the bass
Apparently changed GM/chef and voila, next level
Hopes restored, bring on the spring!
Went for Valentines day and ordered the 7-course valentines' sampler
Romantic, prompt service, nice presentation, and my date was lovely
Drawbacks? The Food! First dish tasted like bait, and I'm Chinese, so I'm used to fishy items
The second dish was OK
oysters rockafeller
but how french is that? Next
buffalo wings
Buffalo wings? What wine goes well with Buffalo wings? Following that was a plate of fois grois
The sauteed was nice, but I could have done without the poached
Then there was a fish dish
It was like a fish stick
minus the breading over some fancy sauce
Then a couple of deserts that weren't bad, but not innovative
The only thing French on the menu was the fois grois
and that is by definition French
My beautiful and charming date combined with the ambience made for a lovely evening
I just never realized ambience alone was so expensive!
Cercle Rouge has excellent service
I was greeted right away by a friendly hostess
I tried a delightful strawberry and champagne cocktail which added the perfect accent to my meal
Iv'e never really been a big fan of wings but my friend insisted that we share some, I'm glad she did, they were fantastic
The staff had just the right amount of energy to make any guest feel at home
The overall experience was the perfect cherry on a lovely evening, making it one of my new favorite hot spots in Manhattan
My boyfriend and I were excited about trying this new french bistro
Unfortunately, it was not what we expected
The menu, apart from being overpriced, is very spase
It took 15 minutes to get a server to greet us, 30 minutes to get our salads and over an hour for our meals

This place is falsely trendy--the kind that isn't worth that staus to begin with and will be out of business in a couple of years once Lindsey Lohan stops coming
It goes almost without mentioning that we were compelled to return three different dishes
Go to a better restaurant and enjoy your meal
Don't come here
Food is disgusting, service stinks, drinks over priced, NOT trendy - just because it is in the Meatpacking District doesn't make it Trendy
They should close down, it's valuable real estate for a GOOD restaurant
I was skeptical about this place because of the mixed reviews about service and expensive food that wasn't all that good
But I really enjoyed it here - yes it is overpriced but you don't go to a place like this for the value
You go for the cool atmosphere, inventive and delicious food and to see what everyone's been talking about
We made reervations very far in advance and were seated promptly when we arrived without an attitude (if you can try to sit upstairs - more lively than downstairs)
Service was a bit slow at first but picked up quickly
Loved the shrimp appetizer, chicken skewers and halibut
Had a great bottle of wine for $40 so not too bad
Overall, I really enjoyed it and would go back for a special occasion
I was there for dinner this past Saturday evening
This place is one giant tourist trap for those who think its hip to say they been to the meatpacking area
The food was below average
Of the 5 dishes that I ordered, only one was enjoyable
The desert menu was a joke!!!!!!!!!
Good drinks
nice scene
food is not bad
takes a while to get a reservation
Once we got there had to wait 45 mins for our reserved table
Overall a good experience
I've eaten at Spice Market a number of times
The food is full of flavor and the ambience is energizing
The tapas-style portions give you the opportunity to try a variety of dishes, which makes the place more conducive to group dining
I've always had an enjoyable experience here
Fantastic scene but the food was not quite up to billing, although the cicken samosas were delicious
I got a mixed feeling from the restaurant, but I would go back
My only negitive is that they do not time the delivery of the food, they just bring out whatever is ready
This has pros and cons
We where a large party so food just kept on coming and there was no seperation or break from eating
Maybe it is different with smaller parties
This left us with no down time to talk or digest
Also, the portions are not family size so it is awalkward having food on the table while your guest does not
( not a problem as long as you are comfortable sharing, i
e
business meal
It felt as they were rushing to get us out
The food is very tasty
Go for a standard cocktail and check out the scene - AND EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE! What a waste
The food is weird and not delicious, and we were referring to our server as the Stepford waitress before we had even ordered
The signature drink, Pattaya, is awful and sour
Our Stepford waitress had not actually tried any of the food we asked her about, although she dutifully repeated what she had been told by the kitchen
The food comes out as the kitchen likes, and it is all meant to be shared, which is awkward
Our avocado, onion, radish salad featured 2 enormous fried onion rings piled up over and around the other ingredients
The Vietnamese coffee tart was the only thing delicious we ate
Four of us had a wonderful time sharing appetizers that were spicy and different
Main courses and desserts can be eaten solo or shared
If you like Asian food you'll love this place
The food is excellent
The decor totally transforms a warehouse space in the meat market district into a (huge) corner of some southeast asian city
My only gripe is the wait staff, who are somewhat amateurish and very difficult to hear, though very friendly and accomodating
Was it just our table or do they all have speech impediments?
The Gumnut Babes set out for a Sunday evening of culinary delights, and having made a booking 2 weeks in advance were only met with mild attitude by the girls on the door when we arrived a little late
Everything on the menu looked mouth-watering, so we asked our excellent waitress to select for us, which was a top idea as the food she chose was delicious
Mind you, sharing a laksa among five is a little difficult
The asian market influenced decor was comfortable and chic, and it was nice to dine in a restaurant with a bit of space for a change! Dont miss the Vietnamese Chicken Curry or the Shaved Tuna with Tapioca
The wine list had a decent selection of Australian, New Zealand, European and American wines, with varying varieties to suit the Asian style cuisine
Gumnuter S particularly liked the Pinot Gris from Alsace, France
I've been to SM several times for drinks and once for dinner
I've finally come to the realization that this place is the benefit of a marvelous pr machine without being able to really deliver once you get in the door
Unlike the reviewer before me, what made me KEEP going back was the great reception I received from the bouncers and I needed several cocktails to endure the waitstaff
How ironic! The food is marginal, certainly not worth the price if you're really hungry
If you want to see and be seen, this might be the place but certainly there are better places to do it all for what one has to tolerate
It is a service industry for godsakes and God knows they make you pay for it, so enough with the sub-par service
Once would definitely be too much
I visited Spice Market this afternoon with my wife and had a great time
We had not reservations and upon arrival we just told the waiter we wanted to sit by the bar and have some drinks
When we arrived there were maybe 20 people sitting downstairs, but all that changed a half hour later as the place became packed! I can see why so many people have trouble getting a reservation here
I recommend to try the place first for drinks and light appetizers and come early in the evening, which is when you can just walk in and not be told there is no place to sit
For what I could see, the food is nothing to die for
regular Thai fare with pretentious presentations is the norm
Swung by around 9pm last night with 3 business colleagues from London (well dressed) only to be confronted by a surly bouncer who had the diplomacy and tact of a Taliban
No reservations you can't come in
Forget about trying out the bar
Why bouncers at a restaurant? My wife showed up with a friend around half of an hour later and was allowed in
They spent $20
We went to another restaurant, Market and spent $600
Now if I'm the owner I would be asking myself whether it makes any sense to have a brain-dead moron on the door rather than a Maitre D
The difference between a bouncer and the Maitre D is; the Maitre D says sorry we're full and have a drink at the bar and hopes you come back, the bouncer basically says go away and hopes you don't come back
Not good for business
THE WORST restaurant in NYC
The actual space is very nice, but that is where it ends
I can't even say how the food is, because WE WERE'NT EVEN ALLOWED TO ORDER OFF THE MENU!! I have lived in New York my entire life and NEVER seen a more prententious environment
I have been everywhere in this town, and this is THE WORST!! When we showed up at 9, they told us the next seating was at midnight
That's because every CONCIERGE in the city calls for reservations for their tourists from the MIDWEST!! Drinks were horrible, service was RUDE, DUMB and absolutely useless and ALL this to dine on crappy Chinese food next to hillbillies
THEY CATER TO TOURISTS, NOT NY'ERS
An absolutely useless and annoying experience
and that's from a New Yorker
It is one of those restaurants you go because it is famous
It is all about politics and marketing and PR
I read great reviews on this restaurant in papaers and magazines soon after it is open
and I am really CURIOUS how this restaurant got great reviews from food critics
Perhaps, they don't know anything about Asian food, or they were reviewing the interior of the restaurant
Simply, the FOOD IS COMPLETE DISASTER
it is worse than street food in Asia
but the ambience is good and interesting interior design

to get out, but it's worth the wait if you are not in a hurry
Hope they work out the kinks soon
Ginger was great! If you are ever in Harlem you should definitely visit
I had a birthday dinner party with my friends on Saturday night, we absolutely enjoyed it
The candle lit dining room is so beautiful
Our server is friendly and very attentive
I had the delicious apple martini, the too many ingredients prawn! Im glad followed the servers suggestions
He even brought out a delicious piece of chocolate mouse cake with a candle at the end of our meal! I felt like I had spend a fortune, but I didnt
We had a good time and with these prices, I will definitely go back
This is a winner all over, delicious food, good service and beautiful room
We had a fabulous time here, the food is soooooo good, clean and fresh tasting, everything is so flavourful and great portion, excellent value! I am surely becoming to regular
Rarely coming down from the upper east side, I have found the perfect restaurant
Not only was the food was delicious and the room gorgeous, but the prices are out of this world
My date and I each had appetizers, entrees and desserts, (including a delicious pinot noir) for near to nothing! The most expensive entrtee was $16!!!! Unbelievable in NYC!!!
What a great place, went there for dinner on Friday, my friends are so late, but they hold the table for us, classy
The food is delicious!!!!! The short ribs, the prawns and the branzino etc etc
absolutely wonderful
I agree with the eidtor review that the service could be improved but with this reasonable price, its perfectly okay, The portion is perfect, We just loooove this place, cant wait to go back
We had a great time at brunch
Every dishes were delicious and the hoisin burger is a must
The room is perfect for working off your hang over -- very serene with sunlight streaming into the room
Definitely plan to go back for dinner as the menu looks interesting and reasonably priced
Went to Jimmy's a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised by the terrific beer selection
We ordered a cheese plate, which was a little on the small side, but it came with some tasty sugared almonds and dried fruit
The bartender was very cool and the vibe was laid back--the opposite of McSorley's down the street
I would definitely go back to try dinner
Hearty as hell
Good food, great beer
Sassy waitresses
Highly Recommended
This place is a total joke
They should be shut down
The food was a total disaster
In my 6+ yrs of living in NYC, I've never had a meal like this
Nothing was good
Disappointing
I chose the restaurant almost solely based on the menu I had seen online
Among the offerings were a dish incorporating rabbit, bacon, and snails, which sounded so interesting that I got a reservation
When we arrived at the restaurant, though, the menu was completely different
Gone were all of the interesting dishes which had been so appealing
Instead, Jovia offers relatively standard dishes
Additionally, one of the waiters found it necessary to walk around the restaurant, telling people how to eat their food
So obnoxious
I won't be returning
Simply fantastic!! Good food and great wine selection but a bit pricey and a tad stuffy
yes overall we love the place
finally a spot on the upper east side that we like enough to call our neighborhood restaurant
however, i ordered the ny strip tonight and it was very bland and overdone
perhaps they're still working out a few kinks, or adjusting to the influx of diners after all the recent write-ups
great ambience and good service
This new place is GREAT
Went for dinner a few times and lunch twice
It gets better on each and every trip
The space is comfortable, hip and evryone I've brought loves hanging out here
(What does NY Mag mean that this isn't a 3 star spot, more like 4 stars I'd say)
Josh's food is excellent
Fabulous pasta's seafood and special veal dishes
Love the desserts as well, just need more of them
Lunch was a teriffic suprise
Sat up front and watched the snow fall
Didn't want to leave, and didn't want my soup bowl to be empty
They even have a great lunch burger!! And the wine list is varied, tasty and amazingly well priced
GO OFTEN
This has to be one of the best restaurants in the City
The food is great and creative
The desserts are amazing
Like Zoe, they have one of the best wine lists around
The help knew the menu and the wine list and made terrific suggestions
The first floor is an incredible, crowded, noisy scene and we just tried to walk through as fast as we could
the second floor is lovely and elegant
The staff is very pleasant and attentive
My venison was excellent
My risotto was excellent
The chocolate dessert was excellent
The waiter and maitre were super
The menu is great, easy to read and comforting
I didn't like being led into the back room when I had requested the front room once in person and once over the phone
I didn't like the noise
I didn't like them forgetting to put a birthday candle on the dessert as I had requested
I had called earlier that day to ask if a should mention the birthday to the waiter and was told,don't do that, we'll take care of that for you
They didn't
They're happy team and it was an enjoyable experience
Excellent food with a taste of Upper East chic (upstairs) and Upper West laidback style (downstairs)
Food was great - think Babbo meets WD-50
Prices were reasonable (for the area) - although my wine pour was less than adequate (probably a 4-5 oz pour)
The kitchen is open to the bar area, and that was definitely a treat to see it in action
Portions are small, but decent
Bread service, I agree, was poor
Villeroy/Boch china was fashionable
I would much prefer a table downstairs (same great food, less stuffy)
Waitstaff and servers are adequate, but I'm sure that with time, all the kinks will be worked out
Saw the new opening of Jovia in Time Out
A few clients were in from LA and we wanted a new spot in town to have a bite
These folks are hard core foodies and they loved this place
The food was every bit as good as Gotham or Grammercy 2 of our long time favorites
The lobster was excellent and the venison (in the wild?) was just as good
The chicken was so-so but the lamb was off the charts
We loved the pasta appetizers
Wait staff was friendly and attentive although not as loose and engaging as other top spots in town
Wine list was excellent and not at all expensive

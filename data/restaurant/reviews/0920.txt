Also, the food is excelent and the price is fine
Please go you will not regret it!!!
Great place to go after work on a weekday to unwind
Outstanding appetizers - love the pulpo salad and the many different kinds of drinks they offer
Unique menu choices with variety
Great interior decor
May be pricey but food has always been good and I have gone at least 6 or 7 times
I think this is much more of a hot weeknight spot than weekend after reading some of the reviews
Sit at the bar if you are two - good service and the food comes fast
Great place to relax and not jammed with people and noise
Give it a try on a weeknight
Went to Lucy Restaurant for the first time last friday night with my girlfriend and another couple and had a wonderful evening
A friend suggested the place raving about the food
The four of us shared a few appetizers which were all delicious, especially a chorizo/shrimp dish that came with plantains
Also the hamachi ceviche mixed with apples was sweet and very tasty
For my entree I ate a special that the waiter suggested
It was lamb chops and a mix of more lamb and blue potatoes ( I didn't know they made blue potatoes)
The waiter also suggested a spanish wine called arco viejo ( I had to write it down because I liked it so much)
Everyone I was with also enjoyed everything they ate
I will definately be going back and I am suggesting Lucy to all my friends
On a semi-crowded Saturday night, we waited with some great mojitos (yet pricey) by the bar
Unfortunately, the bartender spilled a glass of wine on one of us - and failed to buy us back a drink
At dinner, after ordering a bottle of wine, they took away our wine glasses and completely forgot about the wine until we reminded the waiter
It's understandable though, he was busy taking pictures of the group behind us
He then never checked on us after we were served our meals
At one point, we told him one of our guests had a dirty glass and he'd like a new beer
He forgot about that too
We finally got our apology (and his excuses) when he presented us with the bill
It's a shame too: food was excellent and had a nice vibe
I'm bad-mouthing this place to everyone I know
Avoid this place!
I went their for a friends birthday the other night
The food was average and over priced for the size of each serving
Our waiter was also not very attentive which was a damper on the evening
Overall the night was average because of the quality of food
It's a shame because the space was cool and the presentation was amazing, but as well all know when it comes down to it - the food needs to taste good
Food was yummy - I had the paella
after a long week of work, sangria was definitely a must and it was pretty good
The service was attentive for the most part
It's an easy location near Union Square
I guess though, in terms of value
you could do a little better elsewhere
but it's convenience over that
I went there recently with a bunch of friends and everything was fantastic
The food is out of this world, the drinks and wine selections are great and the service amazing
You should see what is on the menu
great combination of flavors
The manager, Hector, in spite of the restaurant being very busy, came to our table a few times to make sure that we were happy
The servers were attentive and knowledgeable
We'll definitely be back!!!!
The new management @ Lucy has done an amazing job recreating this restaurant
I have been to Lucy in the past and I have to say Chapeau to the new management
Everything is amazing, from the selections of the delicious courses available on the new menu (not forgetting the drinks menu
great mojitos and nice selections of wines), to the service and ambiance
Great job!!!! Keep it up!!!! I am definitely going back many times
I have never experienced such poor service in my life
Three of us went for dinner during a week night and were extremely disappointed
Our order was screwed up every step of the way
even a simple tomato juice w/ a lemon wedge!!!! Everything we ordered arrived late and it was almost impossible to get a fork to eat my meal with (had to walk over to an empty table and help myself)
Other dinners were equally frustrated w/ the staff that isn't capable of handling more than 1 dinner table
The entrees were equally bad (not prepared properly and drenched in unsavory sauces)
Spare yourself the disgust of this Wannabe Latin restaurant
This is one of the best spots i've even been in NYC
Tha athmosphere it's just terrific
The food it's just great and the decoration very classic but cozy
they have a very nice selection of wines and perfect music
I'll be back soon for sure
we had a great time there
Highly recomended restaurant to join with friend and cooworkers
The place itself count with great admosphere and great premises to have just a great and fun weekend night
I love the food here and the ambience is great too plus the drinks are strong and tasty
all in all a great package
If you liek this kind of food, I definitely recommend it
Have been there at least 10 times already!
I had a wonderful experience with my wife and a couple of friends! The food was wonderfu,what an excellent churrasco! The watermelon mojito is a must
Great lounge area for drinks,we are definitely planning another trip back
THANKS FOR A GREAT NIGHT!
I planned a dinner for 10 guests 2 months in advance
I ordered the Taqueria taco plates for the table (one chickedn, beef, shrimp)- perfect to start off when you have a large group
Red wine sangria/mojitos were a huge success
Shrimp ceviches -excellent, tasty and fresh
Most people had the red snapper entree which included rice, asparagus, clams and shrimp- mouth wateringly delicious and others selected the beef entree with delight
The service was slowly paced however for a relaxing celebration was perfect
A smaller table may find this problematic
The space is warm with photographic artwork on the walls and a clay pot ceiling
I would return in a minute
Prices are a little high but the ambience and food make it worth it
Highly recommended
Hector the manager was very helpful
The crowd is young, hip, well groomed
Changed from it's earlier Mexican incarnation, Lucy's now has a Latin menu which is tasty but quite expensive - one small goat cheese empanada for $11? C'mon
They seem to be going for less a bar crowd than a restaurant one which is unfortunate as the bar area, which is lovely, was full-to-over-flowing and the restaurant was fairly empty
Drinks are a bit pricey ($10-12) but delicious - no wine is less than $10/glass either
I suggest beefing up the appetizer menu and varying the wine list a bit
went on valentines day
Awesome food! I still talk about that dinner
The waitress was very scary
It seemed like she was ignoring us
Why? who knows
The service was sloowwww! I waited maybe 20 minutes then someone offered us water

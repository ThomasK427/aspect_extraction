(How Unprofessional and RUDE
And that is why he got no tip)There was hardly anyone there and we understand why
The waitstaff was hospitable but seemed a bit lost and into themselves
They spoke amongst each other the whole time we were there and hung out at the bar
We had to keep flagging them down
Never again!
stopped by yesterday on a whim, after cruising W
Bdway for restaurants

was pleasantly surprised, the schnitzel was damn good and our waiter was top notch

he forgot our ketchup at one point but was effusively apologetic and immediately gave us some
Some cons: it was humid as hell last nite and our corner table was a bit uncomfortable, however it was cool by the bar where the AC was
Also, although the food was good, I don't think it would be any better than the dozen or so restaurants within a 3 block radius
Service was what made this place stand out
I do think Cafe Noir across the street is still better in terms of giving off that Francophile-Moroccan feeling, though
I WENT TO PFIFF LAST WEEK WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS, AND WE HAD A GREAT TIME
THE FOOD WAS AMAZING, I TRIED A BEAUTIFUL SPECIAL CRAB CAKE AND THE MUSHROOM RISOTTO
ESPECTACULAR!!!!! THEY HAVE THE MOST ORIGINAL DRINKS IN THE WHOLE AREA,I COULDN T STOP DRINKING WATERMELON MARTINIS, THE STAFF WAS REALLY FRIENDLY AND POLITE, AND THE OWNER WAS VERY NICE WITH US, I WOULD TOTALLY COME BACK!!!! I DIDNT CARE IF IT WAS SMOKY, CAUSE I ACTUALLY SMOKE, AND BESIDE THAT THE OWNER TOLD US THAT HER CAT S NAME WAS SMOKY, SO WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
I actually went here becase of the rating it received on City Search
Its really not all that great, or that cheap
I didn't think the food was anything to get excited over
I would have rather spent $10 more someplace else and got a lot more out of my dinner
The portions weren't all that generous either, the spring roll I had was cut on an angle to make it look bigger
The service was friendly but I would never go back
In Short The small eatery moves at a quick pulse, as fashionable women glide through the small space in sarongs, balancing cell phone conversations with finding an open seat
Sitars play over the stereo, and a flower-festooned altar rests against an old tile-covered wall
The menu features fresh ingredients and a lineup of dosas, uttapams and straightforward, Americanized sandwiches
The #1 - Masala Dosa was quite good, I would scale it a 6/10
but I was not a fan of the 'fusion dosa' where the filling went from portabella mushroom to avocado
I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds
For a cute place to go, check out this place
and definatly at leasty try #1 with cilantro chutney
A cheap eat for NYC, but not for dosa
I recommend the #1 or #9 with the cilantro chutney or the curry chutney
Try there chai as it may be the best I have tasted
I have never tasted a dosa fusion entree before, and I have found it addictive
all you need to order is the basic masala dosa
try it with the 6 different chutneys they have
get a lemonade
and you've got a pretty good meal in front of you
it gets crowded there but the turnover rate is pretty quick
and if you cant get a seat or its too crowded
leave
its like a little fast food joint, you can always go back some other time
Love this joint! Great variety of stuffings
love the speciality drinks
and the Chai! A must try!
The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty
I tried the curry chicken, masala and portobello/goat cheese/spinach dosas- all of which were delicious
The highly spiced chai tea was great too
Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per meal, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!
So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious
Sandwiches are straightforward and lovely - drinks in the cooler range from diet soda to a perfect mango lassi
Then you order a dosa (get #12!) and they serve you the Biggest Piece of Food in the World- an unthinkable 2 feet long
Trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge!
Wanna get ripped off and spend your lunch feeling uncomfortable while noshing on interesting food surrounded by health food yuppies???
Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary
The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these
The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co
does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out
We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city, but any time that we  visit a restaurant other than Roth's we are always disappointed
The food is amazing!!!! The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10! This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable prices
My daughter had her reception at Roths May 20th
The food was good, the waitstaff was professional, helpful and courteous
My problem was with the bar
They were not to charge anyone but run a tab per my daughter and her husbands order
Imagine my surprise when I saw the bartendars taking money!!!! We were told from quite a few of our guests that they paid for their drinks
Management should have prepared bartendars much more than they did
I hope they rectify this problem so as not to this to someone else
I also understand it is customary for restaurant to have bride and groom in for dinner so they can taste the food
We tried to do this but management did not feel it should do this!!!!
I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing
Once for dinner and once for brunch
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you
The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again
I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years
The filet mignon is the best I have had in the city and I have been to all the major steakhouses
Lugers, Sparks, etc
The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth's is the Strip House
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city! And Kruno, the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across
His drinks are very inventive, delicious and classy
Great find!!!
Though the steaks were good (not great), they were priced as though they were great
The famous crabcakes were good, but only in texture and not in taste- which is what you get with Maine v
Md crabs
The place is WAY too dark, beyond trying to be cool
The sides were VERY good
Service was ok, and for the price should have been better
No Creme Brulee available, but listed on the menu was disappointing
Overall, I just can't see paying $100/head for this kind of disappointment
The piano man was bad, but I'm sure they have rotating talent
I really wanted to like Roth's, but just couldn't find a reason to

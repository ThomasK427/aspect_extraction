The service was excellent, the food was exquisite, and the belly dancer was great and involved the people in my party
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to have some good Turkish food whether for a small party or a big event!
But I havent found the service here to be terrible or the food to be bad
Never heard anything about a minimum required food order of $30 or had any bad experiences with the staff
I've been eating there for four years and the food quality has been consistantly excellent
The best time to go is for the all you can eat sunday brunch which includes about 40 dishes and costs less than $20/person
I've always found the service prompt and helpful and your water glass is never empty
The chicken is cooked to perfection, the zucchini pancakes are mouth-watering and they have the best dolmas I've ever eaten
My only complaint is that the meze are kind of expensive for what you're paying but you can order three of them and one main dish for two people and be stuffed (and spend less than $50 for dinner including tax and tip!)
Just dont order too much at dinner, and definately go to the sunday brunch
I've never had a bad dining experience there yet!
went for fathers day as well as my wifes birthday for brunch buffet
Food was no more than so so
Day old bread and and not much of a hot food varity
I can expect that from a buffet
No bid deal
Since it was my wifes birtday wanted to bring a cake, they told us it would be a $3
00 per person service charge
This too is absoulutely normal, But since dessert is part of the buffet we decided to go the rout of just putting a candle on a plate of the desserts from the buffet
They plated the baklava and some other deserts from the buffet with a candle and brought it to the table
How very nice of them
If you would like to charge us 5 dollars for service that would be fine, though comming from a restaurant where we buy a dessert for a bithday I thinks it's a bit cheap
Instead they charged us $20 to put a candle on a plate of desserts that we could have got up and gotten for free
When asked about this charge the server got the manager/owner and he told us we were being cheap and this is a normal charge
we told him that is what the tip is for and $20 is a bit outrages for a candle
He proceeded to insult us and told us about how much rent he had to pay and so on
We gladly paid the $20 and wil never ever go back to this plce ever again
Big rip off
In a party of 6, 4 dishes were brought out without the rice
When inquired, we were told that they were out of rice
Without even informing the table, I'm assuming they hoped we wouldn't notice half the dishes weren't complete
Instead, they gave us plates of lettuce as salads for a substitute without asking the group first
After persisting, two bowls of rice were magically produced
Next to us, a woman was berated by the chef and three waiters after she found a hair in her food
It took 30 minutes to bring out our hummus, and the service was sooo slow
The lamb and okra dishes had almost NO lamb
Would definitely NEVER return
The Turkish food was delicious (and moderately priced), the service was prompt friendly, and the ambiance was fun and laid-back
We've been back 3 times already! And every time there is a new, fun dish to try
Definitely worth trying!
I've been here a few times with my friends from Turkey and we all love it here
The Food is good, and a good value for your money
The service is excellent and the bread is the best ever!  I have a lot of fun here, definitely worth it
The decor and ambiance are terrific
Staff are very gracious
Service can be slow, but it doesn't bother me, as I don't go to this place for a rushed meal
I've never felt irritated by what others here called slow service
Nonetheless, staff are always very polite
Food is overall good, although some items really stand out, so I stick with those
the meze platter is to die for, as is stuffed cabbage
Skip dessert if you're a connoisseur
It's not the best
Belly dancer is not authentic, but is good dancer/entertainer nonetheless
we were at this place 2 months ago (last may)
it was 6 of us
it didn't take us long to realize what a rip-off this place is
the decor is not that bad
some tables are traditional ottoman
you have to sit in low rise chairs and the table is a copper plate
it could be really unfortable for a lot of people, because there is no space for more than 2 dishes
now, the worst part, there is a minimum of $30 order to sit inside! WHAT A RIPOFF!! you can sit down and just have one dish or a couple of appetizers!! why? because they have a bellydancer! big-deal! she's not even authentic! she's an american student with no ability to belly dance! BIG FIASCO!  the waitresses are so snobby that if you don't order the most expensive wine, they don't even come back for 10 minutes!
Good food flavorul food, prompt service and a full bar
You no longer need to trek downtown for good Turkish cuisine
I have been to Turkuaz on many occasions
The food is consistently excellent and service is very good
They do serve Turkish wine and beer
There is belly dancing on the weekends
I would recommend a reservation especially during the weekends
this is not a restaurant - must have been listed by mistake
I have been to Urban America several times, and I've never been disappointed
They offer a wide range of comfort food
Everything is always fresh and tasty
The brunch is also excellent
I think they have the best pancakes (strawberry/chocolate chip combo is to die for) in New York City
The steak hash is superb too
I have found the staff and management to be extremely flexible and always friendly
They never roll their eyes when you ask to make a substitution
If you have enough room after your entree, you should definitely think about dessert
Finally a great little restuarant for the Upper West Side! Really friendly staff and owners, excellent homestyle food-no dieters need apply here
Have just changed the wine list and offer some excellent values
Excellent new upper west side eatery
As the name suggests it has a patriotic theme but in a very cool way, the walls and seat cushions are decked in deep reds and blues
The lighting is dark and romantic
The tabletops are steel and there is lots of metalwork decorating the bar and dividers
Food was excellent
The bread was hot pretzels with spicy mustard sauce that were fresh and tasty
The smoked pecan chicken with macaroni and cheese was homestyle delicious and the shrimp and veggies with angel hair pasta was perfectly cooked and flavored
Average $14 entrees
In Short Named after the daughter of amiable founder Dave Thomas, this Ohio-based chain is more inviting than your typical fast-food joint, thanks to comforting touches like carpeted floors, Tiffany-style lamps and plenty of foliage
The signature square burgers are made-to-order; chicken sandwiches are available grilled or fried
Thick fries, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate Frosty
Fine Dining takes on a new definiation at Wendy's 8th avenue
The service is par no gratia, and the quality is ambidextrious
It puts the le cirque to shame and fame
HAY!!
I've eaten here several times as a precursor to east village debauchery and the place never disappoints
It always seems to not be crowded (inexplicably) because its cheap and has great service
It appears to be a family run place and the decor is not great but the food is really nice and easy pricing
The beer selection is quite good--all asian styles and even (yuck) budweiser for the uninitiated
Try the duck village

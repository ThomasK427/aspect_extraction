HUGE fry basket
which crippled at least on of our lunch party
Good all the way around! Sweet potato fries were excellent, and i don't think they do the kobe burger original style anymore
but they did have a kobe wellington that was EXCELLENT
Go hungry, and walk back to the office
Try Rare's burger sampler
It's the best way to acquaint yourself with the wonderful food they offer
My burger maven friend and myself headed here to taste their beef and were very pleased with our Kobe Beef burger - the most expensive on the menu, but migthy tasty
The onion rings were crunchy and had just the right saltiness and the french fries were also quite tasty
The menu of burgers is huge, but they're all done well
It's well-priced but it is a notch above a Soup-Burg in decor - dark lighting, very sports-bar like - so not date recommended, but definitely for a pig, er - cow-out!
Who would have thought? My friends have been bugging me to try this place, and I have resisted
Well, they finally won out, and I went this past sunday
Service was great and tack-sharp - we felt relaxed, not rushed, just a great sunday afternoon
We didn't have to ask for anything, refills were there, sauces, everything
The food was spectacular as well, I had a classic burger and sweet potato fries
everything was perfect! Thank you for making the day wonderful
My wife and I had dinner at Rare on Friday, 3/4/05 and we thoroughly enjoyed it
I had the black bean and beef chili and my wife had the day's special, chicken noodle soup
The chili was loaded with beef and was served on a plate overflowing with strips of multi-colored taco chips
The chicken noodle was a winner too, loaded with chicken and noodles
But the best was the burgers, two Rare classics, with sweet-potato fries
The burgers were large, jucy and cooked to perfection
The fries were really different, we ate every last one! Service was great
Atmoshpere was fun
All-in-all a satisfying, fun evening
I will be back
All I can say is amazing
I had the Kobe burger, my friend had the classic
We shared a sampler of their fries, with different dipping sauces for each one
Service was top noch, it was good before, seems to be stepped up, both the food and service
We didn't feel rushed, just a nice and relaxed sunday afternoon
The place just feels good - something different, don't know if it was the music or lights or something else, but we will be back very soon
Went there on Saturday between lunch and dinner but they let us sit in the dinning room anyway
Best cheeseburger we ever had
Onion Rings great too
I waited over half an hour for the Rare Classic Burger
My friend and I both order the burger to be medium
The burgers came out to be dry and tasteless, like eating paper
The sweet potato fries was not that good also
I am very disappointed at the food and service
I don't understand where the high rating come from
I think I deserve a much better burger
I won't go back there again
Had a birthday party for a friend, 10 people
We were seated promptly and they accomodated our group, by putting two tables together
The service and attention was great
My wife had the Kobe burger She said it was out of this world
I had the shrimp crab burger, loved it
We ordered appetizers, calamari, spinach dip, wings
That was great
Every one at the table raved about their meal
The wine and drinks and service was out of this world
All in all we had a great evening and I'm coming back
I can't believe this place is known for its hamburgers! There are definitely much better, less expensive hamburgers in NYC
On top of that, the manager was extremely rude
Will definitely not go back
This is not your normal hotel restaurant or burger joint! This place was awesome! Very creative menu and selections
They have all types of burgers, beef, checiken, veggie, so it appeals to all palates
Very impressive! Highly reccomend to anyone looking for a laid back evening, with good food
i have been eating at rare for almost a year now and it keeps getting better and better
this summer the roof was a great after dinner place to unwind
a rooftop bar with no cover and the best view of any other bar
upstairs or downstairs rare is the place to be
While it's true the drinks upstairs are a little pricey, it's worth it to take in the view on the roof and then go downstairs to the bar for a more reasonably priced apricot martini
There are all sort of burgers to choose from though I usually go for the Classic and then add on any of the numberous great toppings
My husband likes the burger salad and the salmon burger as well, and I just had the ahi tuna salad which is a another great burger alternative
For dessert, the chocolate bread pudding is a terrific indulgence to be shared
The atmosphere is always great and the staff friendly and helpful
We've made it our neighborhood place
Just writing this puts me in the mood for a cheese burger with an order of shoe string fries
See you there tonight!
Between the overcooked food and inability of the staff to calculate a bill that came close to prices on the menu, I will not be back
Service was SLOW
Can't imagine coming with more than 2 and eaing in under 3 hours
The rooftop bar staff is nice eye candy, but rude!!! And drinks are WAY overpriced
Hopefully they improve to what their staff posts here
I have had nothing but good times at rare
the burgers variety and flavor is soooo delicicious
when waiting in the bar for a table the Hostess and manager are always very accomodating and polite
i'ts always well worth the wait
i cant imagine eating a burger anywhere else, and after dinner the view on the roof is great for unwinding and having a cocktail
I dined here after work, determined to decide for myself whether the hype was worth it
I had the Mexican burger and my colleague had the Rare cheesburger
They were both cooked to perfection and excellent
The frickles weren't very good
The service was good and our waitress very friendly
The prices were average for food, but the drinks were expensive
All in all, it was a RARE treat to have such a good burger
look for almost the same price as a 2 bigMac meal you can get an amazing dinner at rare
the service it top notch
I was one of the first customers and i still go back
the menu changes and the dishes are getting better and better
Do not go to this place
I've been there twice now and I will never go back
The first time was good enough that I was willing to give them a second chance, but my second visit was as bad as it gets
The waitstaff was very rude, it was impossible to get my water refilled, they messed up the check, they messed up the order, and to top it all off, the burgers were WAY overcooked
Even if the food does come out ok, its still overpriced
Bottom line - don't chance it by going here
The potential for a terrible meal greatly outweighs the the marginal enjoyment that could come from a good meal

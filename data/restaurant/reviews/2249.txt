didn't think asking for our coats warranted such treatment
wonder if the same thing would have happened if i were a man?
If you want to spend a ton of money on mediocre food while hanging out with old folks, then this is your place
Peter Luger's is way better than this
I'll never go back here again
This place is just a stuffy, smoke filled restaurant with rude hosts and bad atmosphere
My wife and I had an 8:30 reservation, we show up a few minutes before and the host mumbles something to us about waiting at the bar and they'll tell us when the table is ready
Time rolls by and I keep on getting up and asking what the deal with our table is and they say soon, soon
AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER
we 're still not seated
Then another host comes up to us and asks Are you guys going to eat dinner or what?
I was so mad at that point that we just left and went to Il Nido
Seen in and referenced by countless movies, television shows, books and articles, 21 is one of the few restaurants in town which can be called legendary
The menu still stocks retro classics like Senegalese curry soup, lobster thermidor, and chicken hash--plus that infamous burger
The waiters are as disarmingly brusque as ever
And you'll still spot an occasional celeb or tycoon
Yes, it's overpriced
The food is good, not great
But you can practically breathe the history in this place: for an hour or two, you'll feel like Margo Channing (or male equivilant), and you really can't put a price tag on that, can you?
When I was younger, my family took me to the 21 frequently
At that time, it was wonderful
I was feeling nostalgic recently and decided to go back
Wow, has it changed! The tables were so close I was practically sitting in a stranger's lap
The food was bland and the service was inattentive
I guess they think the name and history of the place will carry it
Great food in a unique atmosphere - a New York standard - a must do although pricey
Get the seat along the wall for great people watching
This restaurant is soooo expensive and the inside looks like a TGIF
The food and service is much better than TGIF of course, but you are paying heavily for it
The table next to mine gasped when they saw the bill
The Scene The long, cavernous space, done in warm tones and simply adorned with stenciling and old photographs, has a casual feeling without going overboard on the Hellenic themes
Service is warm and professional
The Food The fare is mostly traditional, with a few contemporary specials offered nightly
Molyvos serves excellent, impeccably fresh, grilled whole fish
Red snapper, porgy, sea bass and others are enhanced with just olive oil and fresh herbs
Successes include the superb rabbit stew--sweetened with pearl onions and a touch of fortified wine--and the braised lamb shanks with orzo
Dessert highlights include a moist semolina and almond cake and the racy lemon pudding
The studio I worked for was near Molyvos so it was my idea to take a friend Saturday
It was 11:45 but the hostess, who knew we wanted appetizers, graciously seated us
It was the last pleasant moment of the evening
The waiter eventually took our order and the busboy informed us that one appetizer wasn't coming, the kitchen was closed, and we made do until the pita ran out
no more bread
The manager asked if we wanted coffee and I informed him we hadn't been able to enjoy what we had
Minutes later pita magically appeared
We were charged for the missing appetizer and when I complained to the manager, who never thought to apologize, he blamed the kitchen
When I mentioned that the hostess knew we planned to order he told me she HAD to seat us and I wondered who put the invisible gun to her head
When deciding to visit Molyvos (which I had heard good AND bad things about) I was quite dissapointed
As noted on their website, their amazing chef apparently is cheaping up his cuisine, and using canned goods to make imitation dolmades and calamari
The noise of all the plates banging made the experience even worse, and the service did not listen closely to our order, as I recieved a dish that I did not even order
Either it was a bad day, or Molyvos is a hyped-up restaurant with a declining reputation
I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed
Recently arranged a party of eight on short notice and thing worked out perfectly
Everything dish we ordered was excellent - grilled sardines - great; grilled octopus - terrific; beets w/skordalia - great; lamb ravioli - fantastic; vegetarian stew - boring (I know, don't ask me why someone chose to order that
)
Service was also very solicitous, never felt rushed
Waitress told us when we were ordering too much food and actually steered us to a slightly cheaper bottle of wine which she said was better (and it was quite good)
It's not cheap
But for this quality and the location (this isn't Asotria, after all), the prices are reasonable
I can't believe how fresh the seafood is at this place
I am from the Gulf Coast so hard to impress me
The absolute best thing on the menu is the appetizer seafood salad--calamari, mussel, shrimp, crabmeat
It comes in a bread bowl and the lemon juices soak into the bread so you eat it with the seafood
Delicious! We also do their whole grilled fish and it is perfect and deboned tableside
The ambience is business casual, nice decor, spacious, great service
It has become a favorite so we also tried the sister restaurant Estarios Milos and found it to be 3 times the price and snobby
Molyvos is the hands down the best and they also have traditional Greek dishes like lamb chops and mousaka
I went there for my birthday and the decor and the feeling of the restaurant is wonderful~ The lighting is comforting
The service was very good, and they had an extensive cocktail, beer, and wine list
The appetizer was delicious, and the baby lamb chops were tender and flavorful, but the couscous was so so and I thought there were a bit too much of the herbs to the point where it covered the flavor of the artichoke and the brussel sprouts
I would recommend this place for people that love the strong fragrant herbs in their dishes~
Very please with the ambiance at Molyvos
I swung by for a quick lunch and they had a plentiful menu
the food is a tad pricey but not too bad
Lunch ran me $20
Everyone receives a nice basket of bread with some delicious hummus to start
very pleased
We just spent 6 days in NYC and ate at some of the most recommended restaurants - Molyvos was our favorite! Excellent lamb and veal dishes in a relaxing atmosphere with superb service
We'll recommend and we'll be back
I've been here about 8 times now, and each time I had a wonderful experience
The food is of high quality, and most dishes (including the desserts) have a few flavors intertwined, so you during each bite, you'll get an unexpected flavor surprise that is positively delightful
The decor is warm, and the music is kept to a nice level, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL TO TALK! Warm crab cake appetizer is excellent, as is moussaka, lamb shank with orzo
The service here is always impeccable and discreet
Makes for a nice business dinner, for folks willing to go beyond the standard steak, French or Italian restaurant!
Everything was great ~ from the food to the decor to the service
The grilled octopus was amazing
And they don't skimp on the servings
The red snapper was so flavorful
And the baklava was one of the best I've ever had
They use a combination of nuts (almonds, walnuts and pistachios) where most will only use walnuts
Great place
I will definately go back
I went here on a Thurs
night around 8:00p
What I liked was that it was peaceful without being dead
No having to yell to talk, no posers at the bar
just nice, well-behaved people looking for a drink/nice meal
While a bit pricey, the food was quite good
My greek salad cost about $9 and for that price, I would not have expected chopped olive (as opposed to whole), and shredded bits of lettuce
And while the salad was otherwise very nice and delicious, it was small
The moussaka was excellent

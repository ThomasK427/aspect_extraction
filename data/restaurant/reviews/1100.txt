Service is friendly and solicitous, but can be a little unfamiliar with the menu
The Food The menu offers a playful updating of Mexican favorites
Standout selections include taquitos stuffed with roasted asparagus and Cabrales blue cheese, coriander-crusted lamb with ancho pepper glaze and the rich, subtle house guacamole, almost a meal in itself
Other dishes are less successful: a salad of crisp-fried squash blossoms is drenched in tomatoey dressing; tortilla-crusted tuna is droning and lifeless; and roast duck is overly greasy, though its accompanying pepian sauce is deep and complex
For dessert, a fresh berry chimichanga shines; the mildly spicy chocolate-jalapeno ice cream is more novel than delicious
I had my brand new $15 lip gloss on the table and the waiter threw it away
The manger was SO rude and hung up on me when I called to ask him to ask him about it
DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!
Was promptly seated for our reservation on a busy Thursday night at this festive restaurant
The menu had some slight twists to conventional upscale Mexican
Everything we ordered tasted good to very good and the portions were ample
Service was harried but friendly and willing to explain any item we requested
Finally and possibly most important, the margaritas were very good in a city whose upscale Mexican restaurants don't always pass the muster on this test
We decided to go to Ixta because we enjoy Mexican cuisine
As soon as we were seated we tried to order Sangria
Our server said the bartendar could not make the Sangria because there was a large party at the bar
Didn't make much sense but we ordered apps and bottled water
About 30 minutes later we asked if we can order Sangria because the party was no longer at the bar and the server said the bartendar could not make the sangria
At this point we were very frustrated because the servers response was so vague
We canceled our entrees and asked for the bill
We left without tipping and will never go back
Adios
Just by passing by I discovered the undiscovered
!!!!  The food was amazing!! The coctails were great!! The service was friendly and attentive ! I felt like I just spent a night in Mexico
FIESTA TIME
!!!!
I celebrated my birthday with a group of 12 at Ixta on Saturday night
It's a hip, modern restaurant, and I absolutely loved my tortilla crusted mahi mahi
I would definetly go back
It's a small restaurant with dim lighting, so you get that cozy, loungy feel
The service was unattentive and the only time she came over was to aggressively push drinks on us
The other major problem was that the food was crappy
I got a chicken appetizer that tasted terrible and then got the enchilada which tasted microwaved
I would not recommend this place
This is a sweet romantic getaway tucked in Manhattan! Make sure you have a reservation to avoid a long wait :-)  Can get noisy if the girl at the next table has sipped too much of the sexy cocktails
It seems as though places like this were designed for 18-25 year olds, but I went there with my coworkers--some twice my age--and the place fit all of our needs perfectly
The design is chic but very functional, it wasn't crowded and we all felt much cooler than we actually were
I ordered the roasted shrimp and corn tamoles with a very refreshing tomato relish, the shrimp were cooked very well, and the portion was perfect for an appetizer
For my entree I got the coriander charred baby lamb, it had crushed avocado with some sort of jalapeno creme--it was the best lamb I've ever had
The service was friendly and punctual, overall this is one of the best restaurants I've gone to in recent memory
I've got reservations for tomorrow night
the food is not nearly good enough to wait an hour before seeing your server, or wait another hour for the wrong entrees, or for the manager to make up for it by charging for everthing but giving us on the house shot glasses of watery margaritas
skip the hassle - there is better food ambience elsewhere, and you might actually get what you ordered with a smile
Food is very inventive and extremely well prepared! Guac and their own chips are excellent, Tortilla encrusted Mahi Mahi was exceptional over the plaintains
Baby Lamb chops with cilantro cream perfection
Chile Brownie Dessert is heaven
Service was outstanding
Went pre-theater and the place was buzzing when we left, good bar, great margaritas
Ambience is subtle not over-whelming
I walked by this chic hole in the wall for ages before giving it a try, and better late than never
The staff are kind, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is bustling yet not so loud you can't hear your table conversation
In the warm seasons, they open up the front to allow an open air feel
Recommend: the calamari salad with sliced bananas, with a glass of white
The food here is truly original and outstanding
Not your typical Mexican by any means, but more Contemporary American with strong Mexican influence
I've eaten here many times and have never gotten any dish that was less than excellent
The desserts are amazing
The cocktails are generally good, though they tend to taste alike
The service is generally poor though, and seems to suffer from a serious lack of management
But the food more than makes up for it
The best aspect of Ixta is that it is not what you were expecting
It has a modern, open atmosphere, with exotic food and drinks and friendly
responsive service
Cetainly not your typical Mexican restaurant -- even in Mexico! Be prepared for a novel, gourmet experience unlike any other
I was at dinner last night and the food was entirely inedible
I ordered the warm chicken enchilada and I took one bite and returned it
My date has a seafood and rice combination that existed of about 5 pieces of tiny seafood and 2 pounds of rice
The space is reminiscent of a school cafeteria because the tables are so close together
We too were charged for tortilla chips and guacamole (which we didn't ask for) and the drinks were RIDICULOUSLY priced
Overall after paying a ludicrous $95
00 tab we ordered Domino's pizza when we returned home and it tasted gourmet in comparison
The food was good, the drinks were delicious and the service was friendly
The only reason why I wouldn't be in a hurray to go back was I felt the tables were a little too crowded together
If you are interested in hearing your neighbor's conversation then that could be a good thing
The bonus is that we were able to get a table on a Saturday night at 9 PM unlike many other places on Park
My husband and I had dinner at IXTA
Wow ! It was terrific
The signature drinks are not only delicious but gave us a good buzz
The food was sensational
Everything - perfect quality
Couldn't have had a nicer time
This place is very warm and cozy, Food was great and a good mix of traditional and Nuevo Latino
Service was prompt and courteous
Extraordinary dcor and fun music
Drinks are great, a good change from the usual
A place that will most likely become my regular hang-out
Highly recommended
Ixta is like an oasis in the middle of noisy over crowded Bars of park avenue
It is like a gem of a restaurant, where one could relax and enjoy the evening with friends for a reasonable price
It has soothing ambiance that is supplemented by soft background music and a friendly service
The best of all was the authentic New Latino cuisine that is suitable for american palate
The Manager personally came as a host and explained the food items to us; he had some very interesting stories about the culinary history of Mexico
Drinks are phenomenal Visit to this place is must for all
Waited an hour for reservation
Wrong orders
Charged for guac not ordered
Busboys only source of service
This place makes Taco Bell/Dos Caminos look like good values
Our first and last experience at Ixta was awful
The hostess (who we were told was having emotional issues) was very unpleasant

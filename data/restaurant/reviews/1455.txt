Appetizers were perfect: garlic shrimp, salad with goat cheese, jicama and greens topped with a balsamic sesame vinagrette, seafood trio martini (tuna/salmon/white fish with a special sauce on top) FANTASTIC, all sushi rolls GREAT
Our water glasses were constantly filled without asking
For entrees the Pan seared chilean sea bass delicious, filet mignon chow fun, melt in your mouth steak and the teriyaki wild king salmon perfect
We tried a chocolate mousse dessert which was small but delicious
Besides the location I have to say this was a perfect evening and meal
By the time we left the place was packed
What an amazing establishment, Hurrahhh to Avenue C and it's revival brought forth by NOLIA! I am a loyal Nolia customer since the first time I layed eyes on it's beautiful decor, exeptional wait staff, and delicious dishes
BIG UPS to my Bartender, go on girl with your fabulous Mojitos
Another must have---Golden Dragon Sushi! Come to think of it, I'm going over there
not NOW but RRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIGHT NOW!
Everything about the evening was perfect
From the welcoming waitstaff, to the amazing appetizers (Garlic Shrimp was fabulous) to the wait between courses
Everything we put in our mouths, including the organic wine and the fabulous mojitos, were enjoed to the fullest
I recommend this restaurant highly! May be a bit out of the way, but you will not be disappointed
And I will certainly be returning to try other fabulous menu offerings
This restaurant has great food and a hot staff
Great for dates or group parties
Also makes a fab after hours spot
The cocktails are the best-- even my boyfriend was requesting them!-- try the kiwi martini or the mojitos
Anything you get off the menu will be great, but I particularly loved the filet mignon spring roll and the spicy tuna crunch
I've become a regular!
The atmosphere was very relaxed, fun and sexy, with a great looking staff
The food was delicious
I cannot wait to eat there again
Every neiborhood worthy of the name neiborhood should have
or want to have a restaurant like nolia
the owners and staff are uncommonly welcoming
the fare is exellent , the prix- fixe menu is a steal , even beating the previous undisputed champ more or less in the same part of town , le tableau ; i highly recommend the schlep over to ave c 10 street
you will be treated like a king or queen
will get fine meal and you wallet won't be terribly lighter
the wait staff is uniformily polite without be in obsequious
what else can you ask ; exellent meal , fare price and wonderful wait staff
Great lil secret amazing fusion of french and sushi dishes
I will be back with to throw my next party
I made a reservation for 10pm on a Friday night, and arrived to find this restaurant COMPLETELY empty
I was so surprised
True, the location is a bit off the beaten path, but with food that amazing I had expected otherwise
The lobster was delicious, the sushi the freshest I've had in a long time, and the drinks perfect
My only complaints were the smooth jazz elevator music they started playing, the fact that the restaurant was so empty I felt like everyone could hear my conversation, and that the waitstaff seemed a little young and inexperienced
Regardless -- I can't wait to go back again
The presentation is amazing, the tasting plate is a 4 part delight that blends into a themed masterpiece
The menu just changed this week and i had the each peach I am a White chocolate fan, and if you are you will love this
And is it just me, or is Will Goldfarb a hunk? Id go back just for Chef McDreamy
One Word
Waou!
I love everything about this place!
from the friendly staff to the delicious desserts, from the design of the room to the music played
everything about Room 4 Dessert rocks
No wonder they're getting so much press! (they dedicated a full window to the many press articles they got so far
) If you a foodie (like me), this is heaven!
the desserts we had were creative and delicious and worked really well with the recommended wines
In my opinion, this might be the ultimate spot in town to bring a date, and even if the date is well
boring, you'll still have a great time watching the Chefs plating desserts in front of you, it's dessert and a show!
pretty awesome concept!
I took my husband here for some dessert after a nice romantic dinner
We really enjoyed the nice ambiance, friendly employers, and as my husband said excellent drinks
I would recommend this bar-like, dessert restaurant to anyone
I'm not a big dessert fan, but I met a friend for a drink there the other night and we found it cuz it was really cozy looking packed with people
We had just planned on getting a couple glasses of wine, but ended up sampling most of the menu! My favorite was the apple dessert, which came with little squares of pear and apple jelly
The Chocolate mousse was really good too
Oh, also, they have handmade cotton candy! (surprisingly delicious) We had a great time, one of the guys behind the bar was really hot and friendly
The prices are on the mid-high range but what in New York isn't? I like the portion sizes
not these gigantic plates of sugar! I'd definately recommend it to friends
While I love the concept of dessert tapas/small plates, the execution left much to be desired
The apple tasting dish was decent, the praline and caramel one was pretty bad
The brioche was overly greasy and heavy as opposed to light and fluffy, the caramel ice cream wasn't that cold or caramel-y, and the lemon meringue was a bit too tart
I have a huge sweet tooth, and I didn't have the urge to finish any of the desserts I sampled - they just weren't that good
entire staff were friendly and knowledgeable, the menu is enticing
will have to visit again to taste other pairings
all in all i had a pleasant experience here
try it!
The Times got it right about the ambience
It's as if they ran out of money--bare bulb lighting, ugly beige paint job, no bar--just no thought into it
They got it wrong on the food
Standard overexplained and fussy food but in the end no better than decent neighborhood joint
Halibut with some kind of fancy breadcrumbs was just breaded halibut
Every sauce is a foam
Octopus salad came in a mold form chopped up like a tartare
Chocolate/salt sorbet inedible
Crudo opener average
Do't go
Return of 1980s nouvelle cuisine
Well prepared dishes served in tiny portions
I left hungry
Elegant dinning room, excellent service
If you must, eat before you go
Lights must've been fixed as of last week as the light was perfect for the surroundings, not too bright and not too dim, just right
The food was excellent, had the Rabbit app
and the Pork Belly entree and both were great
Desserts were a bit small, and not to my liking
Had the lemon poppy with ice cream, it was mediocre at best
Overall I would recommend the place if you are looking for a fine dining experience and a very kind and polite waitstaff
Not sure I can add much more to what has already been said
the food really is outstanding
the rabbit appetizer was spectacular, along with everything else
Unfortunately whoever was paid to design the restaurant should be forced to return their fee (and all the stuff)
really unfortunate design and lighting
too bright, everything looks cheap and some of the waitstaff could use an upgrade
the overly enthusiastic you're at Disneyland act is pretty grating at a restaurant of this caliber
Although the sommelier was very helpful and no one was rude which is better than most in this city

The music is not live, and consists of teeny-bopper selections
Don't sit in the lower deck by the dance floor if you want a peaceful and romantic atmosphere
The views of downtown Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty are wonderful, though--go at night!
the web site touts world class chef's but they must have had the night of on our trip
Food was very disappointing and service not much better
Ship had seen better days, a 70s decor that may be back in style in 10 years or so
chairs are one step up from plastic patio furniture
only thing that saves this trip is New York city itself and the views
If you are a tourist then its worth it for the cheesy music and see it for what it is
If you are a NY'er looking to impress a date
look elsewhere
The menu looks great, apparently conceived by some the city's better chefs
Unfortunately, it quite obvious that this food is not prepared on board
The meat entrees, we had the veal and filet mignon, seemed to be drained of all flavor and doused with salty-sweet mushroom sauce
Kinda like airplane food
Yes, the views are very nice
The DJ started with elevator musak and moved into some nice jazz then deteiorated into prom music
Disappointing
I went on the World Yacht cruise with my mom and sister
We had an elegant evening with just the girls, but how I wished I could have been there with my sweetie! The skyline was absolutely amazing from the top floor of the yacht, and the service was incredible
They went so far as to give us a free dessert (probably out of pity because we were three women in the midst of so many couples)! Guys - I also witnessed a proposal - hint, hint
NO TENNIES
Formal dress
My g/f treated me here for my b-day on a (very) stormy night (+/-)
The hosts were all semi- couteous (they didn't look like they wanted to be there); the food was ehh (certainly not worth the price); and the boat, well outside it looked like poo, but inside was a suprise considering the exterior
Overall, the cruise was ok
The only thing that made the night special was seeing the lighting strike approx than 50ft away from the boat every few minutes, and most especially my date
(PS: Be prepared to pay an additional $20 for pic, $30 for drinks, and $1 for tip)
My husband and I went on this during our visit to New York
It was a great way to see the skyline at night and it was a fun ride
The food was o
k
I think the atmosphere is what makes this worth while
It made an enjoyable evening
The views were spectacular
The food didn't measure up
Ordered filet mignon, and had to send the first one back for being overcooked
This was handled graciously, but it was still bad, like it had been in some chemical bath
The mashed potatoes were notgood either, tasting as if they came from a box
I ate bread, and the vegetables, as well as a dessert
My husband's salmon was overdone, but he ate it
The couple next to us had the filets mignon and weren't happy
Still, I had a great birthday (The wine helped
) I took a pair of sandals so I could walk comfortably afterward until we found a cab, as we did not want to pay for a limo
Getthere early for the best seats
I would give it a higher rating for value if I had just been able to eat
Oh, and definitely dress up!
The world Yachy Cruise Dinner is a fantastic place to spend any evening
the food is fantastic, the service is great and all are very friendly
I highly recommend this ( even as a luch cruise) Thanks hope to go again soon
I went there on a Sturday night with a date
It was filled with tourist
Everyone was dress down instead of up
Service was lousy
I wait 25 mins jusst to receive bread
Your money for romance would be better spent someplace else
I have had a better and fun filled time on the Spirit of New york
I thought World Yacht would far exceed them
Boy was I dissappointed!!!!
food was excellent and the service was A+
The trip around Manhattan was a moving site
Lady liberty was a buety
I've taken the dinner cruise 4 times already, and it's a great way to see the skyline at night
It's great for out of town guests, especially
The food and music are great, also
This is the best way to experience the best of New York
I took friends from out of town on the cruise and it was nothing less the spectacular
The views are the best in New York and the food was far beyond my expectations
OK, so the cuisine isn't ambrosial, but it is really terrific
The lamb I had was as good as I've had anywhere
My girlfriend had Salmon which was just terrific! The desserts were'nt my cup of tea (I'm just a regular Chocolate Cake kind of guy) but I was so full, it didn't matter
Also, the waiters were really, really nice, if a *tad* inexperienced, but they did their best to make sure we had a great time
All I can say is that I can't wait to do it again!!
The cruise itself was beautiful and had wonderful views of the city
The food was terrible! The meat was overcooked and dry and everything else was not memorable
I would recommend it for the experience, not the food
The food was good
The wait staff was effecient
The value was acceptable for the price
The view was a treat
Easy to reserve and easy to accomplish
Will return to this service often as possible
Only negative was a cab back to the theater district
Although a bit pricey, it is worth every penny
Highly romantic and very good food too
A great and different way to see New York City -- makes for an original date!
My wife and I hosted our anniversary party aboard World Yacht
The food was fabulous, the service excellent, the views magnificent
We danced the night away with our family and friends
It was one of the most special and romantic evenings we have ever spent
We were delighted to find this gem right here in our own backyard!
I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting to be sitting on top of other people
Fellow diners are mere elbow's length away
The view was fantastic though
even though it was raining
The food was not too bad
The only scary part of the whole trip was trying to catch a taxi afterwards
They DON'T pick up at the dock; at least they didn't that cold, rainy night
The only transportation is overpriced, over pushed limos
We had to walk 7 blocks (in heels), to have a nice couple offer to share thier cab with us

You definitely can't stop at just one
What sucks is the crappy service at this crappy place
The waiters walk around with the plate in their hands but cant remember which table placed the order
I learned my lesson not to go back there, well not if Im hungry that is
The food was delicious with their wraps, salads and wide variety of healthy burgers
I had the steakhouse wrap
The 2 for 1 drink specials are great and the atmosphere is very comfortable come as you are
The Scene Behind the often-fogged windows at this small restaurant is a homey atmosphere, full of smiling employees and Filipino families crowded around simple red tables
The menu (which changes daily) is scrawled on a blackboard above the glass counter, where food is served cafeteria-style
The Food Satisfied exclamations of "Masarap!" (Tagalog for "delicious") vouch for the authenticity of the food, including the highly addictive lumpiang shanghai, small, crispy fried spring rolls filled with a zesty mix of ground pork, carrots, soy sauce and garlic
For the entrees, the adobo, tangy chicken or pork swimming with vinegar, soy sauce and garlic, is a perfect addition to a mound of fluffy white rice
The fiercely pungent tinola matches chicken in a sinus-clearing ginger broth littered with spinach
For dessert, try the halo halo, a drink mixing crunchy shaved ice with a creamy mixture of milk, sugar, sweet beans and cold ice cream
Having been in many different filipino restaurants accross the country, I can safely say that the food @ Elvie's Turo-Turo is palatable
Unfortunately, If you are thinking of having some friends over, you may have to settle for take home
The place does not have a lot of space for comfortable dining
This is not a good place for a romantic or business dining experience either
However, the staff was very friendly, the price was affordable and the food is definitely authentic
I would recommend this restaurant for a casual and on the go Filipino dining choice whenever you are in New York City
I will rate the restaurant a 3 for space, a 5 for location, a 6 for affordability, a 5 for portions and a 7 for taste
Go and check it out
You may like it
You walk in and instantly are transported into any Filipina's house
Grandma, Mom, Auntie, doesn't matter
Binegar, soy sauce, pish sauce, garLIC, ginger, chicken, lechon, oh man, it was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good
I swear I thought my grandma would walk out of the kitchen any moment
Just like a home cooked meal, literally
AND, all the pood and even dessert was under $20 for two people including drinks and dessert
The restaurant doesn't have a lot of space, but that's ok
If you want hip and no taste for too much money, go somewhere else
If you want to be reminded of home, or experience REAL Pilipino Pood Pirst Hand honey, then you'll go to Elvies
BTW - Coyote Ugly is just up the street for those of you who want trendy
If you are looking for an authentic filipino dining experience, Elvie's is it in NYC
From the Lumpia, to the pancit, to the adobo, to the Halo-halo dessert, this small local storefront restaurant has it all
just don't expect ambiance cause there is none
just excellent food  recommended!
If it's authentic food of the Philippines that you want, Elvies Turo-Turo is by far the best for value and taste that I have found in the Metropolitan New York area
Food served here has the quality of the best home-cooked meals I have tasted outside the Philippines
You will not be disappointed as to quality and quantity of servings
Most likely you will return again and again to further sample the specials which change for each day of the week
After returning to NYC after living overseas for a while I became turned off at the so called restaurant scene
Mostly everything in NYC is style over substance; its more important to have hip music, hot waitresses and inflated reputations of the chef du jour rather than real food
Elvies is the antithesis of the NYC resto scene
Its about the food PERIOD! And its so unbelievably rustic and stick to your gut that reminds you of Grandmas Sunday evening dinner
NYC is lucky to have you Elvies--please stay the way you are
Short of being invited to a Filipino home for dinner, Elvie's is the closest you'll get to tasting Filipino delights
such as mongo (lentil stew), chicken adobo, pinakbet, and longaniza (sweet cured pork/sausage)
For the adventurous of heart, try the balut (a sort of duck egg that tastes like cheeze) - it's great with a light beer
:) The halo-halo, a shaved ice dessert, is wonderful
There's nothing bland about the food - I'm happy to say that, at Elvie's, the Filipino taste is alive and well
and affordable
even after all these years
a true neighborhood dive
If you don't want to pay Manila Garden prices or are looking for homecooking you won't find at Cendrillion, Elvie's is the place to go
It will remind you of Mom's cooking, which was oftentimes MASARAP (delicious, for you non-Filipinos) but sometimes a miss, too
You can always count on their chicken adobo to satisfy your hankering for that brown sauce over rice (just watch out for the chicken bones), as well as longanisa or barbecue
but the kare-kare is hit or miss
Hands down, it's the best authentic Filipino food in the City and the best value
The Scene Old Devil Moon, a southern-themed restaurant in the East Village, is as hard to forget as the chorus to "Sweet Home Alabama
" Strings of Christmas lights dangle across the ceiling; banquettes look like they were torn from the back of old Chevys; saws and deer heads hang from the walls
The menu ranges from country ham biscuits at brunch to gigantic grilled steaks and veggie jambalaya for dinner
We had three problems with Old Devil Moon: the price of the food was unreasonably high for certain dishes (8 dollars for 2 eggs, an English Muffin, and a side of fruit consisting of a quarter of a banana, part of an apple, and a few giant, soft, green-grapes); they charged us 20% gratuity for a 6 person table, when the 6th person was a friend dropping by for ten minutes and consuming an iced coffee; and the manager was unpleasant, inflexible, and bitchy
I used to be a huge fan of Old Devil Moon, going there a few times a month
I will not return
went here early for an early dinner on a friday w/ friends
only a couple occupied tables
drinks came quickly but our entrees took quite awhile
as a vegetarian i was thrilled with the options for me; my meat-eating friends had a ton of choices, too
my friend got the special (served til 7pm) - catfish, slaw, rice, a PBR or iced tea AND dessert for $10! the sangria is great but avoid the pricey nothing-special rot beer float
This place is very homey and is great for vegetarians although they also have meat dishes
I am not a vegetarian, but at this place I prefer the chicken fried tofu to the chicken fried steak
Everything I've tried at this place is good
I highly recommend going on Thursday nights when they have live music!
Was looking for some good soul food on a budget
Had to hail down waittresses in trashy outfits too busy chatting at the bar to notice you
Food was horrible
I will never again go to Old Devil Moon
The first time I went to New York [with friends] we went here to have Brunch
It was half an hour to three I think, they were about to stop serving but they let us order anyway
It was soooo good, and the biscuits are very good, this coming from a southerner
So i moved to New York and this is officially one of my favorite places for Brunch is i'm looking for something more traditional, with a spin
Lot's of good, spicy sauces as well- which is intresting up here in the bland [when it comes to hot stuff] North
I've liked what I've eaten at Old Devil Moon, but considering how crowded it is at brunch, I don't know whether it's really worth it
Everything is a la carte at brunch, so if you're expecting to get a deal for $10 that includes coffee and a drink like at other local brunch places, then mosey
But great pecan pancakes, and large quantities
Service was random at best
but the place was packed
While the service was really, really slow, they were also really really nice and I enjoyed my meal at this funky little east village space
The options for vegetarians were numerous and I had trouble deciding, which is a switch from the usual well, I guess I am having X caue it is the only veggie dish on the menu The buffalo tofu fingers were great and I'll be back soon to try some other dishes
Maybe I'll have better luck with their dinner menu, but breakfast was quite disappointing
The pancakes tasted like wet flour no matter how much maple syrup I drowned them in, and the ham was thin and practically charred
I was so pleased with the friendly service (at first) that I commented to my friend that it didn't seem like NY
However, at the end of our meal the lump of flour in my stomach turned when we were asked to leave because other people were waiting
There was only ONE party that had just arrived - they would have surely waited 5 minutes without becoming impatient
And we wouldn't have left with such a sour taste in our mouths -- literally and figuratively
Went to ODM with 12 friends on a Sat night for a birthday dinner
Food was great- down home cookin'
The fun relaxed atmosphere only added to the positive experience
It wasn't all positive though
The wait staff went from apathetic to almost-friendly, and sort-of attentive

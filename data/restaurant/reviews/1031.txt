otherwise, its usually a very pleasant experience
I go here all the time since i live in the neighborhood
i love it but i have to say the service is usally pretty bad
I am shocked that I have not heard of this restaurant sooner
I have been apart of this neighborhood for years and never knew that HK existed
I have been here for lunch/diner and I have to say I was impressed
a beautiful restaurant that actually has good food
I'm coming back for brunch and I will keep you all posted
I have lived in the neighborhood for a couple years now and have been consistently going to HK since it opened
Without exception, the food is always good, the staff friendly, the drinks quality an the atmosphere trendy yet somehow relaxed and easy
There are better places to eat, there are trendier places and there are cheaper places but this is well above average in any and every category so I am happy to highly recommend it
I live in the area and wanted to try the rest
so we visited was last sunday evening, 6
30pm
the hostess seat us (4) as she was putting down the menus she said you need to take your bottle of the table
I had placed my almost emply bottle of Poland spring on the table next to me (it was 87degrees out)
I asked why and she said because we don't carry that brand here, with that turned on her heals and left
with that my party decided to get up on our heals and leave too
I have never experienced this in a new york restaurant let alone and upscale diner like this
my party will never go back and the number of people I have recounted the story to who also live in the area won't either
pity I didn't read the reviews here first!!!
My boyfriend and I had just moved into the neighborhood and were looking for a place to eat
HK was recommended by our friends and has been our favorite place since
The decor is fierce and the food is absolutely delish
The staff is wonderful and attractive
The food was out of this world
I just ate there for the first time, and I had to come home and write them a good blog because its the least I could do
It was my second date with my girlfriend and we came in for a late dinner, she had the fish, I had a steak and we shared an appetizer of escargot (snails), first time I ever had that
For dessert we shared a chocolate cheese cake and little chocolate truffles, all of course homemade
Just as we were getting ready to leave our waiter informed us of their late night happy hour which to me is unheard of, but who am I to argue
We ended up leaving around 3am and the bar was still crowded
Bravo to the people over at HK, you just gave birth to your favorite customer
I have been eating here a few times a month since it opened over a year ago and the staff still doesnt have it together
They are slow and lazy
If you ask the server for something you get a nice roll of the eyes and an ok fine
The food is good but usually takes so long to get that you forgot what you ordered
If the staff actually got it together and showed some customer service this place would be good
If you dont want to wait on people then you shouldnt be in the service industry
HK has forgotten to deliver portions of my order twice now! Terrible!
shame on you
u stole the menus of 212 and re-create the menu lay out
the 2 peter and alex u r a bunch of amateurs
I read about the place in HX so I had to see what everyone was talking about
All I have to say is Pretty people Pretty Place Pretty Food
The Scene On the block between uber-chic Schiller's and 'Inoteca, this little bakery is a breath of unassuming fresh air
The furniture is old and mismatched, the walls are bare and the baker is the counter person, the espresso puller and also the person who'll ring up your order
The Food The owners used to work at Magnolia Bakery, so naturally there's going to be talk about who makes the best cupcakes
These are pretty good: The vanilla cake is superior to the chocolate, and the chocolate icing is superior to the vanilla
But what's surprising is the pumpkin spice cupcake--the cake itself is extra-moist and excellent
A selection of whole tarts, cookies, cakes and cakes by-the-slice is available in flavors like orange, pistachio, red velvet and devil's food
The muffins and coffee cakes are fine, though they might benefit from a bit of salt
Ok so I actually like their vanilla frosting more than Magnolia's, but I like Magnolia's chocolate frosting more than the chocolate-almond frosting at sugar Sweet sunshine
which surprised me a bit actually, since most people said they liked the chocolate frosting at sSs more
In any case, their vanilla frosting is reeeeeeeeally yummy, the cake itself has a nice flavor and is more moist than Magnolia's, and they're just really great cupcakes overall
This may sound strange describing a cupcake, but these taste more modern than Magnolia's
for some reason, Magnolia's taste very old-fashioned
so if you're not into the old-fashioned taste, these are great, simple and classic cupcakes
Cute bakery too
although the lower East side is (obviously) pretty sketchy, so I'm not sure if I'd go back when there's still Magnolia's and Crumbs in better areas
Definitely worth stopping in though if you're in the area
First things first, do not expect the Mona Lisa of birthday cakes, but you can expect to moan like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally when the sugary concoction meets your lips
My order was a pretty standard birthday cake
You can probably play it off as homemade if you're really trying to impress
I wanted something special for my sister's 21st birthday so I requested special colors and designs, but the basic design didn't really matter as the cake was devoured momentarily
Sugar Sweet Sunshine rocks for the following reasons: (1) the owner is involved in the bakery's management; (2) the price is right; and (3) they deliver
I called Sugar Sweet Sunshine to inquire about ordering a birthday cake in advance
I was told to call back tomorrow because we're closing up right now
I said I wanted to know about having the cake delivered
I was told it would cost me a lot of money
When I asked what was considered a lot of money the response was a giant sigh and it depends on where you live in the city
I said I would be just around the corner to which this person responded If you're just around the corner why don't you come pick it up
The decision was made for me to order my birthday cake somewhere else
When I told this to the person on the other end of the phone, he kindly hung up on me
Nothing sugary or sweet about the service at this bakery
I was in the city recently and this place (being down the street from the awesome Economy Candy store) was on my list of places to try my first Red Velvet cupcake
I have to say, it tasted like nothing
just a bland cupcake
It doesn't taste like anything but flavorless, sweetish cake
I was very disappointed
not sure what to expect but SOMETHING
Also, the chai latte was nasty
Perhaps they messed up my order but it tasted more like steamed milk than anything and it didn't have a hint of the clove flavor chai has
Beyond that
this is a very cute place
I'm sure that their other items are great
We had an adorable waitress/server who was very nice too
I hear their Banana Pudding is out of this world
My boyfriend and I went on a cupcake run tonight, we went to Magnolia (it tasted like pure sugar and gave me a headache) and to cupcake cafe (I thought it was good, because I am not someone into really sweet stuff, my boyfriend said it tasted like a sugar free muffin with butter on top) and then Sugar Sweet Sunshine
We died and went to heaven, the best cupcakes I have ever tasted
The colors are so beautiful, cakes so moist, frosting just sweet enough and the pumpkin spice was wonderful
My dad loves the pistacho
hands down the best in the city and worth the long trek to LES
Cupcakes were moist and sweet without being too overpowering leaving your mouth thirsty
Definitely the best cupcakes I had so far! Besides cupcakes, there are other special cakes
Deliciously moist cupcakes that are not too sweet with a nice light buttercream icing to compliment them
I tried the red velvet and found it to be worth going back for
Well worth $1
50
fabulous everthing: cute store, nice people, high turnover (=fresh!) and remarkably cheap for the NYC cupcake scene($1
50 each! and they are big!)

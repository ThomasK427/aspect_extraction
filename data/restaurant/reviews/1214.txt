Excellent mango martinis for only $5! My coworkers also loved the appetizers
It's a great place to eat only because the food and ambient here is done to perfection
I am a regular here and enjoy the mix of Japanese Sushi/Sashimi bar along with other Malaysian, Thai and Vietnamese dishes
The service is remarkable, you'll find yourself right at home
Don't forget to park in the parking garage right across the street and to bring your parking ticket to have it discounted
The service was excellent
I went with an extremely large group and the wait staff handle the group with ease
They were quite attentive and always knew when we needed something
Parking was surprisingly easy to get in the area and the food and decor was very nice as well
I orderd the Tuna Pizza(yummy), and the Chilean Sea Bass (delicious) while my girlfriend got 2 house Special Japanese Rolls which she just loved! But the chocolate dessert we ordered was the best
If you love chocolate you'll love the rich chocolate cake dessert! Next time I come I'm going to bring some friends
Highly recommend this place! Happy eating
Had dinner here recently, I gotta say the food is fantastic, definitely recommend the Trio Beef, Chilean seabass, and chocolate cake w/ fried ice cream
Service was excellent and we will definitely be coming back
Although pretty inconspicuous from the outside, Pacific Echo turns out to be well worth the visit
I took a date to PE and was quite taken with the stylish decor and the very cool ambiance, from the deign of the tables, to the lighting, mood music, the very cool bathroom and especially the food! Although the menu is priced to reflect the location, at Pacific, the food is wioth it
This is a great restaurant with a very interesting menu and a very friendly staff
I look forward to going back soon!
I really loved this restaurant
The staff were friendly and approachable, and offered polite advice on the menu
The decor was modern and understated, with a low-light, lounge atmosphere suitable for intimate or casual dining
The food was inexpensive, and exceptionally good, with strong flavours
The dishes we had used citrus fruits for flavouring which meant they tasted quite different from those we have had at other Indian restaurants
The food was very mild in spice, although apparently they can make it hotter, as you please
I have never physically been to this restaurant, but I always order their boxed lunches to be delivered
These box lunches are fantastic
They come with a meat curry, a vegetable curry, rice with Daal, and Naan
The portion is fairly large and I usually barely finish it (I believe they have a few options that you can choose from with the box lunches)
I must say that I love their chicken Tikka Masala
Many places do not marinate the chicken enough before cooking, which makes the meat dry, but Darbar's chicken tikka masala is marinated very well, resulting in the meat being very tender and juicy
It is my favorite Indian place to order lunch from
The lunch buffet is amazing
The staff is nice and the atmosphere is pleasant
Def
check out this place on the east side
We stopped in for the buffet one Saturday and though the food was quite good, the selections were rather limited
I frequent the Indian restaurants in Jackson Heights, and am accustomed to a choice of at least 10-15 entrees, naan, samosas and other little extras, plus chaat
Here, there were only about 5 entree choices (all of them standard - goat curry, chicken mahkani, saag paneer, dal) plus naan
The food was good but for the price, I expected better
I'll stick with Jackson Heights in the future!
I was there at this restaurant on several occasions with different groups
Never has it failed to impress me
Great food, excellent service, beautiful ambiance and properly priced is how I describe it
The outer looks dont tell a lot about this restaurant but once you are in you will really like the place
I highly recommend it for family outing, friends and even to share a dinner with your business clientele
This was perhaps the best Indian food I have ever had
The dishes had distinctive, distinguishing tastes, and weren't simply the same old takes on these dishes
The owner and staff are very accessible
between the lovely service, delicious dishes (you MUST try the beetroot-- trust me!) and the relaxng atmosphere, i begin craving darbar the minute i finish my meal there! each time it gets better, and the owners make you feel incredibly welcome
probably the tastiest indian food i have ever had!
I went at about six on a friday night and it was empty except for Happy Hour going on downstairs
The service was great-the waiters brought the food quickly and politely
The food itself was amazing, rich sauces and tender meats
I could've eaten the whole resturaunt if I had the chance
Everything was excepional at this resturaunt!
i have been there about six times every single time it got better, every single dish i have eaten there has reminded me of back home specially of reshmi kabab, cihcken tikka masala , goatcurry, garlic shrimp bhuna , goa fish curry have been simply outstanding service has been consistently very attenttivethe ambience is simple yet very trendyit was a pleasant  surprice to see couple of bollywood hollywood stars dining in at couple of my visit always insist on seating on upper level diningroom
This place, although tucked away on a funny block of 46th street, is probably the best Indian food I've had in my life
I've been there at least 10 times now, and am always impressed
Everything is incredibly fresh, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the smell of the food alone is enough to get you hooked
I've done the buffet once, and it was awesome (and incredibly cheap) - probably the freshest Indian buffet I've ever had
All in all, knowing this place makes me feel like I'm on to something
I've been dissapointed by almost every other Indian restaurant I've been to since trying Darbar
I highly recommend Darbar
For New Years, they worked with me to prepare a special evening for my someone special
They even lent me their fancy dishes, cloth napkins and silverware and offered to bring it over to my apartment for me
On the day of the event, the food was late and I got worried but the manager ended up coming to my apartment to explain and apologize
The brunch deal here is incredible and the staff is wonderful
Sit upstairs on the balcony for the best view
This is by far one of the best deals in Midtown
Their $9
95 Lunch Buffet is full of variety and flavor
The setting is modern but casual and the servers were eager to help
Be sure to get there early, though, or there can be a wait
In Short Mia Bauer started this bakery with 150 of her own recipes, and now her whimsical cafe boasts a loyal following--everyone from moms with kids to "dieters" who can't resist
Pictures of oversize sprinkle cookies adorn the walls, while blackboards list gourmet cupcakes (fluffernutter, pistachio) and complementary beverages (crumb cupcake steamers, hot berry cider)
Clear jars of rugelach and tarts sit above the main display case, and wicker baskets of muffins provide a less sugary alternative
I had the most phenomenal cupcakes imaginable!!!!! Honestly, they were so rich and flavorful that I couldn't even eat a whole cupcake
Even saving it for later, it tasted faaabulous
I get these cupcakes for work all the time, we can't get enough!!!
The service is very friendly and it's a charming spot for people watching
Delectable arrangement of cupcakes
They look gorgeous, however, the one I got was dry and not as chocolatey as I had hoped
Coffee is passable
If you're looking to blow your calories on a treat I would keep looking
Thes best cupcake by far in NYC
keep up the good work!!
Great cupcakes in two different sizes, moist cupcakes, perfect amount of frosting
An amazing variety, too, 'though the classic yellow cake and chocolate frosting can't be beat
Can't comment on any other baked goods - they look passable
the best cupcakes hands down!!! Truly tasted like they were baked 5 minutes before I ate them!
The Scene From the enthusiastic greeting of "Bonjour!" at the door to the playful prints of French ladies dotting the walls, there's nothing shy about this bistro
Behind the curved marble bar lies the small dining room with striking red banquette seating
Service is friendly, if sometimes overeager
The Food Heed this advice: the more French the dish, the better the experience
Forego the less-impressive crab cake pyramid in favor of snails in mushroom caps, generously bathed in garlic and parsley, or the savory oxtail terrine, which seduces with complex texture and flavors
Among entrees, the tender hanger steak-- with the taste of shallots--is even more pleasing when paired with a side of sauteed spinach
The seafood-heavy bouillabaisse puts most to shame, though the lamb shank is bland
Do not miss the crepes suzette, which end the meal on a high note
We have enjoyed Jolie many times for dinner
I decided to take a friend there for lunch and it was a disaster

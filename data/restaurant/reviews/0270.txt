, not so many customers at that night
we ordered 2 cokes, 1 pizza, 1 special risotto add calamari(remember, it's add)
After I had some of my coke then I noticed there is a lipstick print on my glass
I call the waiter, and you know what he did? he didn't give me a new one, he only swith my coke to another glass! Second, my risotto is coming only with calamari(remember add), the waiter never say sorry and repeat you said you want add calamari
? OK, forget all above, we just want eat something, so we kept the wrong order and asking for pepper, finally he brought a piece of PAPER to us
This is the worst experience for 6 yrs in new york
stupid and rude waiter, nothing care manager
I've only ordered delivery from this place, but what you get is undercooked rice for 13 dollars, plus they charge you a delivery fee
Never again!!
This restaurant is great, although I'd love to know what the other two gluten-free friendly places in nyc are


With the menu here clearly designating which items are vegetarian and gluten-free, there are many, many choices and no fear
Service was attentive, but not overbearing
A simple place with good food!
There are 3 (count em!) 3 gluten free friendly restaurants in NYC
Now, you can have gluten if ya want, but this place went to the trouble of actually listing on their menus gluten free veggie dishes
The wait staff was very helpful and friendly, the risotto is DELISH, (and don't miss the coconut gelato) ample in size and not outrageous in price
Ambience is not romantic, pretty casual, but that would not stop me from going back!
Everything that I have ever had here has been absolutely marvelous
The wine is not too shabby either, but it is the risotto in all its varieties that wins the prize
I simply encourage all to stop in for some risotto or sample the pizza, panini, or dessert
The salads are some of the best in the entire city, because like everything on the menu it is made from only the freshest ingredients
The only drawback is trying to locate the restroom, which is located downstairs, but after many twists and turns
I was really disappointed with this restaurant
The risotto was bland, the service was horrible and the place had absolutely no atmosphere
It's a shame to waste your money here when there are so many other places to dine in New York
This is to the best of my knowledge the only restaurant in New York that has a gluten free menu
I require this for my diet and I consider this a huge plus in recommending this restaurant
Now, as a restaurant goer the food is excellent and prepared quite quickly
I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who doesn't mind waiting a little for your table
The food is so good that there tends to be a little bit of a wait
But I consider that a good thing in a restaurant
They've expanded their menu beyond their name sake, and the pizza and salads they've added are excellent, but the risotto remains their star
I recomend the Lemon with Pine Nuts, which is not only delicate and filling, but only $7
50! It's a small space but the crowd turns over pretty quickly so its not a long wait (they do have a counter you can sit at while you wait), and the staff is fairly attentive
After you're done with dinner stroll down Bleeker to the nearby French and Italian bakeries to get a mini canolli at any hour to finish off your healthy, cheap dinner
The possibilities of Risotto are limitless and exotic
The service is not good
Granted the waitresses are busy, they seem to forget that you are even there
The food, when it comes, more than makes up for it
Unbelievable salads and large portions will keep you coming back for more
there seem to be a lot of complaints on here about the service, but i went to risotteria the other night and the waiter was polite and attentive
the risotto, of course, was fabulous
In Short The setting is comfortable and sophisticated--men stroll through the door wearing mink coats; women are decked out in sequined tops and tight jeans
Service can require a little patience
The food is French, Latin and soul food rolled into one
Dishes include warm, crunchy corn and crab fritters; tender and sweet barbecue ribs with onion marmalade; pecan-encrusted catfish with tomato chutney; and an apple tart for dessert
We went to Jimmy's Uptown on 02/21/04 at 11pm to celebrate my sister's birthday after the initial restaurant we picked lost our reservation
We had such a wonderful time! There was a very mature crowd, dressed maturely to impress, the restaurant decor was elegant, very South Beach - the bar was crowded but there weren't any rowdy patrons
The wait staff was delightful, the food was scrumptious, especially the cracked king crab legs - seasoned to PERFECTION and the DJ was on point
After the food we couldn't make it downstairs to the club part, but I WILL be going back to do it up!
I really don't see what all the hype is about
Ok food, nothing memorizing
They don't seem to be very accommodating
Asked to sit in a booth, and was told We only have one booth left, and what if a party of 6 comes in? I had to fight the urge to say Put 2 four tops together, and they will even have room to maneuver
Cant say I will be back
We went to Jimmy's Uptown to celebrate my best friend's birthday as a last minute resort
We had a blast! The food was great, the chocolate martini's were perfect and the service was wonderful
The manager, waiter and hostess made us feel like they've known us forever
We're definitely going back
especially for the chocolate martini's
I have read some of the reviews for this resturant and must say, that Jimmy's is a VERY GOOD resturant
Jimmy is trying to bring some class uptown, and obviously some people are NOT ready for that
Yes, the prices are high (but then agian what are the prices like downtown?)
The food is good
Good presentation and nice flavors
No the food isn't spicey, caliente
etc
This is not your typical ethnic joint
and that is what some people expect
Thank God Jimmy's Uptown (and Downtown for that matter) isn't the loud sleezy place that Jimmy's Bronx Cafe is!!
The bar was big with an interesting crowd
The food had as much flavor as cardboard
Given the prices, it was very disappointing
Jimmy's Uptown is bringing a bit of elegance to Harlem
While Jimmy's doesn't get it quite right, I find the effort refreshing
Why do Uptown New Yorkers have to travel all the way downtown for a great evening? Now we can get good food and great atmosphere in our own neighborhood
I also recommend the poetry show on tuesday nights
I tried to be objective, but Jimmy's Uptown just isn't worth the hype
I went with friends for a comedy show that was being held in the upstairs lounge
The hostess was far from friendly about when the lounge would open and when it finally did (20 min late) they didn't have sufficient change (though there are two bars and a full service restaurant) for the entrance fee
The food was terrible, and way over priced
Our spicy chicken wings and seasoned curly fries had ABSOLUTELY NO seasonings at all! And let's not even talk about the shrimp hushpuppies
The only redeeming quality: our waitress was very nice
and should have been with the 18% gratuity automatically included on all checks
There are much better no name places to eat in Harlem
I'd stick with those
One last thing about this restaurant
From what the management told me (because I did inquire about this) and from my own experience, things have drastically changed in the past couple of months
They have changed their dress policy now- no jeans, boots, or sneakers- and have changed general managers many times
They even changed the main chef! So, going by the older reviews is probably what mislead me in the first place
From what I understand, the crowd they were getting was not a good one and they had to change that for the sake of their clients
So, like I said before, give it a chance! I really enjoy it and since I am a regular there now, I know how well they treat their customers!!!
I went with my sister and three girlfriends to celebrate my sister's birthday on Saturday and we were ALL completely disappointed
First of all everything on the menu was completely overpriced
I don't mind spending money on good food but when the food is dry and bland as ever, it's completely disappointing
I try to support my people and give money back to the community but it's time like this when I wish I would have gone somewhere I can trust like Houston's or Red Eye Grill
The entire time I kept thinking that I could have been spending my money on a better gift for my sister! PLEASE
take it from me

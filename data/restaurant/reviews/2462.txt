The place is cozy and the food is excellent (the chocolate chip pancakes, pumpkin french toast, and the bacon are all very good)
I highly recommend this place
I am sick of my local takE out Joint('s), and luckily I discover this
This is an Upper West Side staple: a great local restaurant for family and friends which delivers excellent home cooking
The decor is no different, but that's part of what makes it so comfortable
It is a little on the more expensive side (hamburgers start at $9), but its worth it since it does not burn a hole in your stomach; instead your stomach says Thank you god
The meat is lean, and salads are fresh, and the fries are goooood
And don't forget their meatloaf
mmmmmmm
Feels like Vemont
Dynamite Breakfast
Lots of wonderful choices
Never tried the dinner but it looks like a wonderful menu
The food is phenomenal, I especially recommend the strawberry pancakes! My boyfriend prefers the Mexican scramble
we both enjoy this place tremendously
It's one of our favorite all time NYC brunch spots! We've never had a problem with the staff, or the space
Go for brunch, you'll like it!
This place is very low key, I have walked by it countless times without noticing it, but once you eat there that all changes- you remember the place for good
This is a real french place where the staff is French
The food is excellent and the wine selection even greater
The price is very right for what you get
The ambiance is quite unique and the place gets crowded earlier, because of the elderly clientel that attends the restaurant
Everyone has a place in the restaurant and you can find seeting just right for you
The food at La Mirabelle is excellent but the atmosphere made me uncomfortable
It is a bit stuffy and pretentious
Many of the diners were very formally dressed, while the restaurant looks and feels like someone's extra-large living room
The waitress took forever to bring us our cheque
For those who like this scene, go ahead
Otherwise, don't bother
visiting this establishment on a sunday night - maybe it was the chefs night off starters mediocre salad and overcooked chicken livers followed by beef borgigenon that tasted out of a tin topped with peas and onions and monkfish made of rubber and tasteless desserts that were preprapared from the  freezer
If this is the best they can do dont bother
This is a GREAT place and I can't believe I didn't come to Mirabelle sooner
The food is to die for
I would not say that all their dishes are perfect but the lambshanks and mussels marinere come close to perfection
To say it simply: the food was excellent, the atmosphere was elegant but not overly formal, the service was prompt and friendly, and the price was reasonable
I look forward to returning, as do my three friends
I've been a resident of the West Side for 22 years and had always heard rumors of great French food at Mirabelle
Wow! Talk about a best kept secret
this place is great! Just like the hundreds of little family-run places I know in Paris
Excellent, authentic, simple, charming, warm and welcoming are just a few of the words I can think of that describe this restaurant
My partner and I had the pate de campagne and escargot to start, loin of lamb and calves liver, followed by creme caramel and crepes for dessert
Consistently delicious
With a half-bottle of excellent burgundy, the bill came to $103
Prompt and courteous service
Don't expect fancy decor or complex food
Babies and little old folks are an integral part of the clientele
how very French!
I'm surprised that this restaurant was not more highly rated
I ate there last night and was surprised at how delicious and creative all of their dishes were
Their pesto was amazing
It is an unassuming restaurant, but they really know their pasta
I agree with the other posters: the food is not good (they brought out what must have been microwaved frozen bread to begin the meal) and the service is a joke
The waiter would walk away in the middle of you asking something
Luckily the food he dropped all over the floor didn't belong to anyone in my party
or unluckily, perhaps
Truly worthy of being shut down - there are already too many horrible Italian restaurants in this city
In Short This Upper West Sider serves all kinds of confections to appeal to your sweet tooth
Of course, it gets more and more crowded as the day goes on and traditional dessert-time approaches
Many use this as an after-the-movies stop
So why not go during the day? A slice of something decadent, a double latte, and a nice view of the passersby make a terrific coffee break
Yes, the place can get very crowded, and the service is not great, but the atmosphere is very cute
It's a nice place to go with friends just to talk and catch up
Not worth making a trip for, but if you're in the area, it's worth a stop by
The service was horrible
Their desserts are overpriced and it is really crowded
The noise level is equivalent to a sports bar
You can definitely get the same quality dessert in the different restaurants around that location
not necessarily for the dessert
I have been to Lalo many times, and the soft glow of the lights, and the fun, European-style interior never fail to impress whomever I bring there
While they certainly have a long and exhaustive list of dessert options, I find that the idea of the dessert is often better than actually eating it
Pies, however, are a standout (I just wish the slices were bigger), and the milkshakes are good, too
While they offer about twenty varieties of cheesecake, none of them are great
The option of (real) fresh whipped cream and hot fudge toppings definitely helps
Cake-based desserts are often disappointing
The service is OK--pleasant but not particularly professional
And the tables are definitely cramped, though that's part of the charm of the place
On a warm night, with the windows open, and french jazz playing in the background, it is pure romance
Adorable cafe on the west side
Tables are a bit scrunched together but the patrons and waitresses make it bearable
Charming old-fashioned euro decor plus a great selection of yummy chesses, dessert, tea, coffee and snacks make this cafe a must stop if you're in the area
This is a great place to go for dessert and coffee after dinner
Be prepared though as the wait on a Saturday night was about 45 min
There are park benches outside to wait at
Fun to have the You've Got Mail movie experience
The big difference we noticed was there were a lot more tables so it was a bit crowded
This place is great for a date or coffee and dessert after dinner
if you can handle it
It's extremely crowded, and the service is lackluster, but the music is fun and the decorum is quite lovely
The food is well-presented but not particularly delicious
The coffee drinks are excellent, however, and during warmer months they open all the windows
It is drastically overpriced, so be prepared to pay dinner prices for dessert
Don't bother with the savory food
Some places just have a certain charm that makes them seem magical
This along with the fantastic desserts is what explains the crowds waiting to get into Cafe Lalo
Sure, it's busy every time I've been there
And along with that comes noise and sometimes jostling
But it's a fun and festive atmosphere and the waitstaff is doing the best that they can to make everybody happy
With some of the clientele, it's not always easy so give them a break and, if you can, a hefty tip
They deserve it!
This is a very European cafe

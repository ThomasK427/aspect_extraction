The atmosphere attention and service are absolutely fabulous
Food was tasteful, and not boring
I think its one of the finest Russian restaurants in NY
Dining room over the water - on a sunny afternoon/evening, it is really pretty
The food is consistenly good, and at times, better than average
Service has some issues
When I was little (9-10) I used to come here all the time, for people's birthdays and just to eat
they have great food, and you don't usually ever wait to be seated
Place is wonderful
The new show for 2003 was the most amazing i have ever seen
Food is great
Music and entertainment like no where else
HIGHLY recomended
This is not a place for the rigid type
You'll have a lot of fun if you like to try out something that is totally different from everyday dining
You'll see everyday Russian families having their night out and outrageous live entertainment
It can be a little cheesey, but you got to love it
It is not really expensive because it provides elaborate live entertainment
Excellent food at reasonable prices
Courteous service
However, there weren't any views of the bay (at least not since the last time I was there which was around 1998)
But still, the atmosphere was nice
One of my favorite Italian Resaurants!
My wife and I found this restaurant by chance
It turned out to be the best Italian restaurant we ever ate at
Now we take all of our friends there and recommend all to try this place out
We even spent New Years there and had the best time of our life with great food included
Don't let this place pass you by, it really is that good
my husband and i go to Maria's quite often
We travel from Howard Beach but we don't care
It is well worth it
We know Jeff, the owner, only from going there so much
He is such a great person along with Zach and Dino, the two waiters we always have
The food is excellent, the ambiance is romantic as well as simple and lovely
The wine is always top knotch and everyone is friendly
In the summer, the tables outside are a great touch
I would def
recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to be treated like gold, have great food, great wine and a lovely dinner
Dinner for two or dinner for 10
This place can do it all
My brother and his wife took me and my wife here for our anniversary
What a great present
Seafood was excellent as was the service
Good selection of wines
Very attentive to our needs
Not much word of mouth on Maria's, but what a lovely place! Will definately return
Multiple smaller dining rooms give a sense of intimacy
Food is good, specials have been outstanding
Old standards made with an updated twist
Great service, reasonable wine list and tasty food
I hope they don't decide to tear it down and make a russian or Turkish restaurant
Best Thai food in Brooklyn, hands down -- make sure you try the Mee Krob appetizer
The sauces are great, especially the red curry
Prices are reasonable, portion sizes are great, overall a great meal very time -- highly recommended!
I must say I used to wait for summer so that we can go to boardwalk and Tatiana cafe
But this year's visit was disappointing
There're some changes on the menu, (including prices) and the quality of food is not there anymore
I so hope they will turn around for mext summer
(They are open during winter too, it's just so much better to sit outside in good weather
)
I'm Russian - so nothing can really surprize me from the Russian kitchen
EXCEPT for the quality! :) This visit to Tatiana Cafe was very pleasant
We were welcomed by the smiling, attentive staff, who remained the same through out our visit
Dishes were brought out in a timely manner
Food was fresh and very well prepared and served
The prices were decent but the dishes were difinately worth it! The places is spacy and nicely decorated
We will defuately go there again!
Tatiana Cafe has the best food i have ever ate
Honestly i have been going there for several years now, and the food just gets better and better
The menu has so many varieties, and anything that you would pick is completly utterly delicous
The view is beautiful, it is right on the boardwalk
Not only is the outside extrodinary but if your looking for good entertainment with a big party then u can definitly enjoy sitting inside
mussles and seafood fajitas rock
You cannot beat me at the trivia game
I am an avid restaurant goer, and no way in hell will u find a restaurant that offers so much for such a little price
$50-60 is nothing for a night of awesome music (ranging from russian to club theme), great show, and good food
This restaurant's awesome selection of music combined with the biggest dance floor of any restaurant i've been to, welcomes those who enjoy a night of fun and dancing
The new owner is from Asian Russian descent, so be sure to order shish kebab
Always bring your own company - ready to drink and dance
I used to like this place
Then when I was in there two nights ago having dinner, a woman came in and asked to use the bathroom
She looked very distressed and sick
They wouldn't let her use the bathroom because she didn't purchase something, so she offered them the equivalent money amount of a cup of coffee
They started laughing at her going well oh well, I guess there's going to be a 20 minute wait to use it, we're cleaning it
(They weren't cleaning it, my boyfriend used it 5 minutes later
) They made her leave crying, then they all laughed about it when she ran out the door
I will no longer patronize a restaurant that does not value human beings
The new Roll and Roaster in Manhattan is a wonderful addition!! They have perfected the roast beef sandwich
Having lived in Philly for multiple years, I feel able to fairly say that this sandwich has forever replaced the cheesesteak for me
i love this restaurant! I eat here for my birthday, friend's birthdays, dinner, lunch, anytime! It's so convienient since it's close to the movie theaters! I strongly reccomend you eat here! The corn fritters and Fries and Cheese is what i love best! YOU CAN HAVE CHEESE ON ANYTHING YOU PLEASE!
Best roast beef sandwich in the City bar none!
Topped with sauteed onions, double dipped gravy on the freshest best bakery rolls you'll find, sandwich is irresistable
Not chique upper west side or funky west village - just great REAL New York food
If you can make it in Brooklyn, you beat 'em to death in the City! They rein King in Kings!
Great place
The environment is great
The management is friendly
I advise making reservations if you're going on the weekend
I've been going here for years and it never gets old
There are a few chefs who aren't very enthusiastic and not very theatrical, but the end product is always great food

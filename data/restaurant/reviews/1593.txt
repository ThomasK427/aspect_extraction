We went on Sat night and we were there for 3
5 hours
The food was great and priced reasonably, but I'd rather eat at home than pay money to be treated horribly
Dining in this tight restaurant is an irritating experience
While the food is good, it is outweighed by the exceptionally poor seating practice employed by an obtuse seating host/management
If told that there is a fifteen minute wait for a table, start thinking of somewhere else to eat
You will not be seated w/in fifteen minutes
On two similar occasions, a fifteen minute estimate was volunteered by the same host/management
On the first occasion, I was seated after forty minutes
On the second occasion, the host/management aloofly reassured me every twenty minutes that my party would be seated
Naively persuaded to wait it out by the hosts reassurances, we left after an hour and a half hungry
I used to recommend Frank
Now, I will tell all of my friends to stay away
as long as you dont mind waiting for a good bit of time and shouting across the table to be heard over the punk rock that is blaring over the stereo you are in store for the most amazing dining experience in NYC
The meat loaf and the gnocchi as well as the chicken were amazing
the place is maybe 15 tables and there are 100 people crammed into the place but the ambience is authentic and quaint in as much as a mosh pit can be described as such
a dont miss
just go
i've been here a bunch of times and the food's always delicious and relatively cheap
and i really don't get all the complaints about the service- the hostess has been nothing but friendly and the waiters are sweet and totally competent (and cute, too) yeah, it's crowded and small, but it's the east village, not the upper east side
I eat at Frank at least twice a week, the food is that good! Some of the staples include the steamed mussels and the daily ravioli specials
Also the bruchetta is awesome
Tends to be packed on the weekends and no reservations
overrated place, food is average, place is very noisy,try mosto across the street
Tiny and cramped restaurant, which gives it half the charm-- and if you can find charm from a limited menu too, well then you're set
Food is better than average italian, but a bit heavy afterward
You must share a table at times when it gets crowded
For the life of me I can't figure out the appeal with this place
After countles tries we finally got a table on a Sunday night
And boy were we sorry! Garlic bread with anchovies was too salty to eat, Rigatoni tasted like Chef By Ardee
Plus some of the noodles were undercooked and hard
Ravioli special had a filling so puried it resembled baby food
Plus the lack of presentation and dirty looking staff were a complete turn off
Everything right down to the iced tea was awful
On top of all this it's more $$$ than Max!
i agree with everyone who states that frank serves up the best, homemade italian food
you can't beat the quality of food you get here for the price
i also agree with everyone who states that frank has the WORST service imaginable
i've been there for lunch - when the place is empty- and the waiter spent more time outside, soaking up the sun for himself, like he was a patron
i've been there for dinner- with the place packed- and the waiters are always unreachable
they cram you in there like prison inmates also
i had someone at the table next to me joke about wanting to stick his fork into my food
i hate to say, the poor service and lack of personal space is worth it for the food
i won't say that about any other italian place in nyc
If you're looking for rigatoni and meat sauce just like your grandmother used to make, you've found it at Frank! As soon as you step inside, the smell is enough to make you reminisce about Sundays at Grandma's and her infamous meatballs
Pasta is perfectly al dente and flavor abundant, but if you are looking for attentive service, you'd be better off paying a visit to Grandma! But, you do almost feel like you are among family when dining here
The people at the next table are so close they'll join in your conversation
Leave all pretension at the door indulge in some good old home cooking
I recommented this restaurant for a friend's birthday and I was terribly embarassed
Not only did we wait for 30 mins for our table (that we had booked a month in advance) but we were treated like trash, particularly by the receptionist
The service in this restaurant is the worse I have ever seen
It's a surprise that they manage to hire such terrible staff
This place is awesome with just the right proportion of crowd and intimacy
The food is absolutely delicious
Try the roasted chicken, the mussels, the tiramisu, the everything!
OK, I tried Frank twice before reaching any final conclusions, but this is a way over-rated place and the East Village has Italian jewels such as Max and Il Bagatto that one should consider well before Frank
Take the Artichoke Salad for $8
95 I had today: there were some slices of artichoke (which tasted like rubber) on top of unseasoned arugula
I left the whole plate untouched and nobody had the courtesy to ask if everything was OK
I also tried the spaghetti with tomato and basil: this is the simplest of pastas, BUT the sauce has to be GOOD
At Frank, it is NOT and on top of it, the spaghetti is not cooked properly
In summary, with so many amazing Italians in the neighborhood, why should anyone bother with this one?
Maybe I have not been to enough Italian restaurants, but I love Frank
I always go early - say by 6pm so that I may be seated immediately
The service was good and the food was great (at least on the two occasions that I went)
We went there with a party of three, the place was about half full
The hostess tried to seat all 3 of us at a table meant for 2 even though there was another free table adjacent to us! We argued, then they finally let us have our 2nd table
Then the waiter acted indignant when we called him out for bring us the wrong (later) vintage of wine we picked out
AVOID THIS PLACE!
Frank used to be worth the wait for their authentic Italian food
Now a combination of extremely poor service and mediocre food has changed that
There are too many other great restaurants in the East Village to bother waiting for this one
best food service and as for east post don't let their employees e-mail fools you
Really, I am not exaggerating
the service was impeccable and we were 17 people
No joke
The food was fantastic as always
I really enjoyed my night there and my leftovers the next day
I used to eat at Frank at least once a week but went less frequently as the food was getting worse
The final straw was extremely poor service from their delivery staff
I ordered food on a Sunday night and waited 1
5 hours for the delivery
I understand its a very busy night of the week but it is unacceptable that I was hung up on by the hostess twice (I also called back and she refused to answer the phone for 15 minutes) and was told that I should have picked up my food instead of having it delivered
Of course she waited 1
5 hrs to tell me that they were running late
Needless to say the food was cold and soggy upon arrival
I will never eat there again
Try East Post next door for comparable food and much better service
We attended on 6/14/02 and enjoyed everything
We were seated promptly
The food was pretty close to perfect
Deliscious homestyle Italian
I'm sure if you attend during the busiest time of dinner- you might have to wait a little to be seated
But definitely worth the wait
Very unassuming atmosphere
the food is alays good if you can stand long enough for a table and can stand to be treated terribly
always pompous and never respectful
I used to love this place but now I will never return
The food is scrumptious at this tiny East Village scene-and-a-half, where you're often seated family style with impeccably dressed-down rock-boy types who devour their fish (served whole) while their skinny g-friends pick at salads
See if you can pick out which waiter plays in the local band J Majesty

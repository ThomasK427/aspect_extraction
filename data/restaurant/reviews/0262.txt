Wine choices were good and reasonably priced
The fresh Tiramasu was exceptional!
I went to Sotto Voce this past weekend and it was really bad
I had the Penne alla Vodka and the pasta was really really underdone
The service was really bad at several points our waiter would just leave for a cigarette for like 10 minutes while we waited for him to get us another drink or even pay the bill
I was so fed up after waiting 15 minutes that finally I just walked the bill to the bar and paid
The service was really bad and so was the food
Don't waste your time
I eat here all the time
The food is wonderful and so is the waitstaff
I've tried about half the menu over the past 3 years and there isn't anything I haven't loved! I highly recommend it!
Despite what other reviewers had to say, this restaurant is great
I visited it for the first time about 2 Summers ago and have been coming back since
I live on the UWS in Manhattan and without thinking twice take the hike to Park Slope
HINT: Try their Sorbets
Brunch, Dinner, whatever the occasion, just the place to eat in Park Slope
My friends and I had a wonderful evening last Saturday
Our waiter was friendly and helpful in making recommendations
The food was fabulous, the atmosphere very warm and inviting
Loved the lemon sorbet!
I've been to Sotto Voce several time, and I have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time! Between my guest and I, we sampled at least 80% of the menu, and they were all hits
An impromptue pole judge the Fettucini with mushrooms and chicken the best pasta and the Striped Bass the best entree
The Deco and ambiance was really romantic
And they take plastic!!
This place has reliably delicious and afforable food with high end service
Even though it's near by me I would definitely travel for one of these meals and to be treated so well
I've tried almost everything on the dinner menu and enjoyed the bottomless mimosa brumches as well
Truly one of my favorite restaurants! The manager is very attentive and helpful for large parties or special events
I alsways bring out of town guests to this spot and they always leave full and happy!
i've been a fan of this place since it first opened, and was pleasantly surprised last night when i saw that they now accept credit cards
as a vegetarian, i have yet to exhaust all of the menu choices, and have never had a fish or pasta dish that i didn't like
personal faves are the sesame tuna, potato crusted salmon, and rigatoni with eggplant
the room does get noisy when full, but service is always attentive
a fun finish is the lemon sorbet, served in a large (where do they find them??) frozen lemon
I'm a regular at this cozy, romantic Italian restaurant
I have never been disappointed by the food or the friendly service
The prices are very reasonable
An added bonus in the last year is the gorgeous lounge they just built two doors down 4th street by the same name
They even occasionally have live music and poetry readings
Just a great place to relax and enjoy an evening
Despite a friendly staff and ideal location, the food at Sotto Voce is so uninspired that I would think twice about going back
I went on a date here, and although it's set up to be romantic, it was very loud because the decor has nothing to absorb sound
It's a good restaurant if you just want to go somewhere with no surprises
But there are other restaurants in the neighborhood that offer more for less
This place offers a wonderful brunch menu at a reasonable price on the weekends
Service is Brooklyn-friendly!
Wonderful, fresh food and accomodating service
I can already tell that I will return here again and again
The Scene In the sweet but cramped back room, downtown claustrophobia somehow feels like old-world intimacy
There's a lot of Italian spoken--and occasionally sung--by both staff and patrons here
The owners staff the kitchen on a system: Recruit fresh-faced Italian chefs, train them in Modena and ship them to the East Village for a temporary tour of duty
The Food All the imported talent in the kitchen makes for a refreshingly original menu
The namesake gnocco are crisp yet chewy squares of fried bread, served with a generous assortment of top-notch cured meats
Astoundingly underpriced, they're among the tastiest starters in town
Pastas entrees are unusual, homemade and uniformly excellent, but undersized to keep prices manageable
I went on a thursday with my wife to celebrate our first anniversary and we really liked it
We sat outside in the garden, was croweded but still romantic
The place is nice, the service was good but is defenetly the food the best thing at Gnocco
we had some delicious stuffed zucchini flowers and mouth watering pumpkin tortelli with ragu sauce
we ended the night by sharing an huge calzone nutella
we are defenetly going back
I was so shocked about the previous reviews about Gnocco that I had to write one of my own
I have been here many times and I have always been pleased with the food and the service
I have brought my friends and relatives to eat here and they all have been enthusiastic! I never had to wait too long to be seated and the bill was never a surprise
A great neighborhood place with authentic, Italian food at reasonable prices
Defenetly a must try
Wish I had read the last few reviews!!! This was by far the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at in my entire life! The staff was totally rude!!! My children took me there for mothers day, on Saturday night, and for an Italian Restaurant, this was a poor excuse for a restaurant
Not to mention they ran out of Chardonnay, and with the little amount of food we ordered it cost $200
00!!! In addition, I was scolded when I couldn't pronounce a word in an Italian
Did I mention the bill was in Italian, and we had to question everything they charged us for! Please remove this restaurant from the list!
Wow! This was the worst dining experience I have had in NYC in 9 years of living here
It took us 3 hours to eat
People who showed up an hour after us were being served meals while we sat in the freezing cold backyard
When we complained, the wait staff was rude and unapologetic
When the food did arrive we were very dissappointed
My meal tasted like someone had poured an entire salt shaker on it
The calzone nutella dessert was even bad
The crepe it was served in tasted like rubber
F-
Terrible
On average, I eat out four or five times a week in this fabulous city I simply adore and have never once felt the need to write a bad review of a restaurant
Gnoccho, is the exception
My friend and I waited over an hour for a salad, she was served the incorrect salad, our server was nonplussed
45 minutes later our less-than-stellar pizza and their even less-than-stellar gnoccho was dropped at the table; no explanation or apology or attempt to acknowledge the ridiculous wait
Our water glasses were never filled, we were never asked if we needed anything else, and all in all Gnoccho delivered mediocre food served with major attitude
I calmly told the server I would never return to which he shrugged his shoulders and walked away
Not exactly the Sunday dining experience my friend and I had had hoped for--or should pay for
I went there for dinner last Saturday with friends and loved it
We did not have reservation but the hostess was very helpfull and sat us down in less than 10 minutes
We were sitting in the front room with a mural on the wall
The food was amazing just like the wine
Service was great and attentive
The place seems very popular as it was packed with people
The pizza is one of the best in NY and I highly recommend it
Overall place is awseome with great food and service
Had dinner with my sister and her friends who were in town for the weekend
They sat us in the cold area by the windows
Service and food was the worst I ever had in NYC
For six people, he brought us 4 pieces of bread and one plate of oil
We had to ask for everything from plates to more water

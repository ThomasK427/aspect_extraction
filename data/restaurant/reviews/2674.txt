There are long lines if you go at the wrong time, why is that? Because the food is soooo good
When I go, it's on Saturday mornings, right after they open, no waiting, no muss, no fuss
The doubles are light and soft and just so delicious and my fovorite roti are the Conch, Beef (chunks of steak) as well as the curry chicken and oxtail (worth a try despite the bones)
The service is friendly and even if you're not Caribbean and can't understand all that's said, the sing-song accents are really nice to listen to
Go early and there will be NO COMPLAINTS, the food is good and worth the travel time!
It's not a traditional thin crust - it's a medium crust, with toppings piled high to the sky! The slice we always order is $4
00, but makes a meal for both my and my husband
The first slice we ever had here was so good, we were talking about it for days
!
The owner has been there for over 30 years and he still makes the gigantic pizza for cheap
And the pizza is great
You must try it for yourself to believe it
The decor is nothing to write home about and its quite small but the food is great, I PROMISE
Right by the 205 D train stop, Sal's is fresh and decent
I've only had pizza there so far, but the slices are just right - not too thin or doughy, perfectly cooked, good size, lots of cheese and pepperoni
I went here on our way home with my best friend, it was my first time there, and as soon as you walk in you'd think you were in a traditional mexican cantina
The service is superb, one of the waiters even sang for us! The food was excellent, just be careful with the drinks, they are delicious, but strong
The ambiance is romantic and peaceful
Definitely take a date here, the prices are reasonable, so there you have it
you cant go wrong! Enjoy!
You gotta try this place
Sandwiches are fantastic and if you don't know what your in the mood food, they always have a trillion suggestions
The staff is extremely friendly and funny
If your looking for a place that will treat you like home
Go their
The Zoo, The Botanical Gardens, The Bagel Den, Yankee Stadium, these are the redeeming qualities of the Bronx
The Bagel Den boasts real food made by real brothers
The fact that all of the staff are variations of themselves adds to the charm or perhaps poetry of every Bacon Egg and Cheese on a toasted everything bagel
At lunch, try something with chicken
Beware, like the few other good things in the Bronx, these sandwiches are big
Sal Dom's has been a part of my life since birth
No matter how far we had to travel, a holiday is never complete without their cookies and pastries
There is no bakery that can compare
They are the best hands down
This bakery is the talk of the Bronx
During the holidays people come from all over the place to grab delightful pastries of all kinds
Trust me their pastries are worth the wait during the holidays
Suggest you go there early during those times
Their normal schedule is ok
not as busy
Great service, and great food
Their Canoles are out of this world
I am kinda of sad to be posting here because now more people will know of this pastry shop
Great Italian Pastry and Bread
Take out only
but trust me your mouth will melt with their delightful pastries
I love this place
I can get anything and walk away happy, sometimes with a doggie bag
My favs are the Cobb Salad and Chicken Francese
but everything is just terrific
My wife and I have really enjoyed this gem restaurant in our Italian corner of the Bronx
Although plates average about $15-$20, all meals are large in proportion
They expect to wrap up your leftovers for you to take home
All meals start with salad and fresh breads with agli olio
In particular, we recommend the slightly more costly Parmigiano dinner for two that included 3 courses, one with prosciutto
mmm
and a sampling of chicken, veal, eggplant, and shrimp
so good!
I have never had a unpleasent dining experience at this charm of The Bronx
Good service, nice ambiance and good portions of delicious food keeps me a repeat customer
The Brothers know how to keep people happy and coming back for more
and more
and
Fratelli's has become a staple for our family's special occasions, not to mention for catered parties
Excellent food, interesting specials and a relaxing ambiance make this a great restaurant any day of the week
The best hometown deli in the bronx
Great sandwiches, great people and their Tuna is the best in town
I would recommend the Bronx Bomber sandwich and also the Michaelangelo
You can't beat it
If you are in the neigboorhood you should drop by this friendly deli
They will delight your stomach with some Italian Sandwiches and cold cuts
Also they make their own sausage/tuna/cold cuts/chicken cutlets
I will suggest you try them all
They make party hero's
Venezia is a popular lunch spot in the neighborhood, but its dinner entrees are slightly overpriced (the prices are eat-in prices, even though the food is takeout)
If you go, go at lunch
Get the focaccia sandwich - it's delicious
This pizza is great
I am orginally from Bronx,NY and have relocated to Georgia and every year i go back there to get some of their pizza
It is delicious
The service is great and if you go there often, they will remember you
Nicks has always had great pizza
If my aunt didnt live at Gun Hill road I would still have taken the 5 train from Jackson Ave just to get a few slices from Nicks
My brother and sister would agree that Nicks makes us proud to be from the boogie down bronx BAYBEE!
Makes one salivate just walking within aroma distance
I buy extra just to keep in my freezer
Peppino's Pizza in the Bronx is absolutely the best there is! If you want amazing pizza then you have to try the best
Peppino's has been there for over 20 years and the people there are down to earth and always making customers smile! There food is always good and they take pride in their pizza
If you want pizza the way it is supposed to be made then you must try Peppinos in the Bronx!!!
Broadway Joe's Pizza is definately one of the best in NYC! Make sure to try the chicken and cheese calzone (with sauce on the side)
This is one of the best pizza shops in all of the Bronx
Whatever you get there i guarentee will be great
They make great pasta and pizza
I suggest getting the Mozzerella Sticks
They are amazing
I highly recommend this pizza shop
It is simply the best!
I enjoy the menu variety of traditional Spanish food, Chinese food, or American steak and seafood selections
I do not like their seating layout for large groups and feel that booth seating would add to the ambience of the decor
Although they provide booster seats for toddlers, their child oriented care ends there

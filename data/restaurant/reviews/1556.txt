The owner was very friendly, not only just checking in from time to time but just talking to us
Borgo Anticois a satisfying dining experience
Save room for dessert! Their sorbet and flourless chocolate cake were amazing!
Last thursday i had my birthday party at Borgo Antico, from start to finish everything was amazing, and even if it was the first time we ate at Borgo the host and the waiters gave us the attention that only regular customers usually get
The menu that we chose from the website was a bargain for what we've got
My guest, even though couldn't finish it all, loved the food so much that they are planning THEIR future parties there!
Borgo Antico is Giovanni Iovine's romantic union square townhouse ristorante, where chef Ivan Beacco is putting fresh gloss on Italian regional cuisine
The beamed, softly lit dining room is upstairs, patrolled by a genial crew headed by Giovanni Iovine,the music is great
Small meatball and rigatoncini and grilled monkfish are first-rate options, and chef Beacco has an elegant way with desserts, must try the chocolat souffle!
Great for large group
Bravissimo!!!
Nice place to sit and eat, but nothing really stood out for me and the wife
Food was fine, but I guess you could probably get the same stuff at any other upscale Italian place
The upstairs is nice for people watching and staff was helpful, but I don't think they'll be a return visit
I was passing by borgo antico saturday and i noticed a large group waiting at the bar to be seated
Normally i don't like crowded places but under suggestion of my wife Saveria we went in
The owner was very kind, offering us a couple of glasses of wine while we waited for our table
The charming lady at the bar gave us the bar menu so we could start with something different
I tried the arancini di riso and for a moment i thought i was back in my native Sicily
The food was simple, cooked to perfection
The best i had since i was still doing business in the Old Country
I really regret the fact that, since i have to go back to Italy, i won't be able to be with my new friends for a while
But YOU must go to Borgo Antico to really experience our thing! Capisc'???
How many restaurant last 11 years and still surprise you? Not many
Borgo Antico is a great find, in a city always turning very fast, borgo antico seat real easy, the owner Giovanni is extremly accomodting, I had in this place my first date, my wedding and next week the bathmitzva for my daugther
The new chef, Ivan is from Trieste, and I can describe how good the food is you have to try, my word
the wine list is really good, with great varietal of grapes
most of the wait staff are working there for years, they will recognize you at your second visit
bene
I try to keep up a healthy lifestyle but time barely affords me the opportunity of quality
After a daily workout I had to meet my wife and her parents for dinner
Without making any plans I found a Nice Italian restaraunt located on 13th st in union square
The space was calming and the staff and general atmosphere only complimented my first impression of the place
The food was perfect and service was excellent
A great time
Owner Giovanni has been in NYC since 1995 and thinks he can treat New Yorkers with snobbery, belittling customers
The food isn't even great, it's below average
My girlfriend reserved to have her wedding party there and after Giovanni promised her the space, he decided to mention that he may have a bigger party that he would rather cater to on that same day and wouldn't be able to guarantee her anything
He said he would ship our party off to Brooklyn to his partner's restaurant 'Future' in Park Slope
We explained that we were from Manhattan and wanted to have our party in Manhattan not in Brooklyn
He laughed as he didn't care and insisted
He also doesn't listen to what his customer needs are and spends more time talking
There are dozens of better Italian restaurants with friendlier management that don't believe they are better than New Yorkers
THIS is how Italian food is supposed to be! I am an Italian born and raised, moved to NY a year ago
Real Italian food does NOT have so much seasoning/condiments
The dishes prepared here are delicate and balanced, the ambience tasteful
A bit pricey, but good researched cuisine always is
The ambiance of this restaurant makes you feel like you've arrived in heaven and you never want to leave
Intimate dinner upstairs, dessert on the sidewalk as you take in all the nuisance of New York City living are experiences that give a feeling you are doing much more than just dining out
Here's where feeling special becomes something a little bit more erotic or at least an experience like no other
I went here with 4 friends for a birthday dinner, we were late for our reservation but the host was great, very understanding and friendly
However, our waiter was much less friendly
we kept having to ask to have our orders taken and he was rude when all of us did not order 3 courses (we did however have 2 bottles of wine and dessert)
We were a young crowd and he was obviously annoyed that we were not going to be ordering the most expensive items (although our bill was $200)
He took forever to offer us coffee and dessert and then took forever to give us the bill
The food was excellent (a little pricey for what you get), but this waiter definitely put a damper on the evening
Go for good food and pleasant atmosphere, not the wait staff
terrible for parties, atrocious service, do not patronize this restaurant!
With so called italian restaurants opening (and closing) in nyc, anyone who is intended to open a new restaurant in the city should go to borgo antico and take note about how a genuine italian restaurant should really be
the menu, the classic italian fares, to the attentive service and joyful feeling you get from the moment you step in, to the moment you have to leave even though you don't ever want to
Kudos to the owner giovanni iovine and the waiting staff to make me feel at home!! 11 years still rolling
p
s
also hot futura in park slope alsoo wned by the iovine's
walking around union square looking for a good and inexpensive place to eat when a friend suggested this very accomodating with real italian food restaurant called 'Borgo Antico'', old village in italian
It got me by surprise, or better saying by my love for a good and autentic italian cuisine
Now, more than ever, I know how much I want to go back to Italy
Untill then I will became a regular at Borgo Antico
took my father and auncle to the restaurant on mild fall eve,for a great Italian food
based on the great recommendations from this site
I highly raccomand this restaurant and to your friends and family what NYC Italian restaurants has to offer
the best
All that wonderful food and wine
So wonderful!!!!
i came across this restaurant from some reviewers here on citysearch
i'm so glad i did
me and a couple of friends all enjoyed our meal
the service there was excellent
the waitstaff kept on coming back asking if we need anything
very attentive
portions were perfect
not too big nor too small
i would highly recommend everyone to come here and have some authentic italian food
The food is awesome, and though I have read some bad reviews on this site inthe past,  I have to say that I had a great time here with friends last weekend, and the service was prompt and professional
All of our questions about the food were answered politely, and when the food came it was all incredibly rich and tasty! Great dinner, great wine list with reasonable prices, and basically an awesome place to start going regularly
Thanks!!!
All the good reviews that you can read are written by the owner or friends
this place is just horrible in every way
food, service, ambience, etc
Dont waist your time and money!!!
Going to Borgo Antico its more than dinner e
The food its excellent and superb
, service is polite and effective
The ambiance seems like Fellini movie
Romantic and charmy !!!!
This is the place where I meet with my friends after work
The calming atmosphere let you forget that this was the bad day feeling and the food is just delitious you can go as many times and always try something different
The servers are very atentive and always willing to sugest a good dish and the vine to go with it
And the desserts are so good that you dont know which one to order so you order couple for the table
this is where i go to eat real italian food

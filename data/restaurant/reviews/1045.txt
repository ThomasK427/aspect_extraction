I had the Burger with Pomme Frites with home made mayo, was quite satisfied
Have top shelf european beer selection
Wine list was also very good
Tight setting, reserve ahead or recommend lunch during prompt hours
Arrived on a Tuesday night and had about a half hour wait
Bad news is the place is so small, you're constantly getting bumped and jostled by people as you wait in cramped quarters
If you don't mind the tables being so close together, this is a very romantic date spot
Service was knowledgeable, the wine recommendations were right on and the food was good
We'll definitely be back
Not only was the food my group finally received not prepared to order (steaks were over done), I was treated very rudely by our waiter when I asked to make a minor substitution to accomodate my wheat and dairy allergies
As long as I've lived in Manhattan, I've never once had a problem with this type of request
If I hadn't had out of town guests with me and hadn't already waited an hour on a Tuesday night, I would have left the table without ordering
August is over priced for the quality of the food and not even worth trying considering the pompous wait staff and chef
We went last night and the place was great
It's narrow, but that is typical for the area
The overall decor is nice and old world like
The hostess told us it would probably be a half hour but we were seated in ~15 minutes
Our waiter recommended an excellent bottle of wine at a great price
We had the tarte flambe appetizer, which HAS to be tried
It's a sweet onion puree on wood fired crispy flat bread
We have friends that don't eat onions, but come for this dish
I had the flap steak and my wife had the orata fish
Some people freak out about fish with the head still on, but the waitress offered to fillet it
My steak was very good and tasty
Overall, it's a cozy place with great food and a great social ambiance
We'll be back
My husband has been wanting to try this restaurant for a while
We tried last night
When we got there, the host finally came out to tell us that the next table would be available in 45 minutes
I will take some responsibility here, because I did express my exasperation at their No Reservation policy using an impolite word
The Host came back at me with such a force of hostility, the content of which contained a roster of all the top restaurants that all the owners worked at
The man was scary and awful
Any seasoned employee who took the words service industry seriously could see plainly that I was suffering from exhaustion and low blood sugar; and should be treated as a patron who just needed a bit of patience
This man has no intention of winning us over, just getting rid of us, which he promptly did
Cozy European atmosphere with views of wood burning ovens as we entered
Detail given to design inside as well as out in the lovely glass enclosed garden dining area, complete with cobblestone flooring and plants
We dined during the Sunday brunch and enjoyed it so much, returned for the evening meal
We were greeted and attended to immediately
Smooth lattes, smoky flavored bacon under the crme fraiche eggs, and oven toasted crunchy bread were heavenly
Our evening meal yielded some unique and delightful appetizers
Our lamb was the best I have ever eaten, and the sea bass was enhanced by artichokes
We split a Vahlrona chocolate pot de crme that was yummy
I was not too crazy about the vegetable with tripe
The salad with leeks had a mouth watering balsamic vinaigrette
The wine list is carefully paired to complete each selection, indicating quality, not quantity
Recently went with a small group and service was terrible! Every table was trying to get help from the waitress that was ignoring them
Will not return
Not worth being ignored, even when it came time to pay the check
Seriously need to do something about bad wait service! Such a shame because good place, otherwise
I have been to August several times over the last six months and I'm impressed by its consistency
The whole fish has always been very well prepared and there seems to be array of dishes that satisfy all moods
The food is not especially complex, but it is straightforward, delicious, and representative of its region
I like the wine list too which has a nice selection of fun and interesting wines at reasonable prices
In terms of the ambience, the attractive, rustic decor with good tunes gives it a nice West Village neighborhood feel
Went to dinner at August with a large party, and we were all astounded by how savory the food was
All the fish dishes are a success - well cooked, integrity of the fish preserved and enhanced by simple yet tasty sauces
The hits of the night: the octopus, the gnocci, the skate, the orata
The miss was the bouillabaisse
The room has a rustic look (wooden tables, concrete floors, the fire oven for the pizza), which makes the place cozy and perfect for romantic dinners
Of course we went there with a large party and had to wait a bit to get seated (even with reservations), but we had all our dishes served at the same time and promptly
I recently dined in back, the steak was excellent, the service was attentive and helpful, the wine selection was very good and overall i loved this place! This is a place that i would go out of my way to visit even if i had to
The atmosphere is cozy and warm rather than trendy and the food is well executed
Finally a restaurant of wonderful, honest food and delicious wine delivered by knowledgeable staff with (thankfully) none of the pretense
For 5-6 dinners, and a few brunches, each time Ive been to August the food and service has been intimate and superb
Sure, sometimes its busy and loud given their successes (Zagat, NYT, NY Mag, et al) its not surprising
Appetizers of note are the tart flamb, grilled octopus and the blistered peppers
Entre must haves: carbonnade flamande, grilled rabbit and the almost sexual bouillabaisse
As expected, the wine list is as thoughtful as the menu the staff has earned my trust with their bullet-proof recommendations I have yet to be disappointed from their exhaustive list
Panna cotta, profiteroles and the cheese plate are the desserts for me
Go for brunch and have the Alsatian-style wood-oven baked eggs and a wonderful latte bowl
We randomly happened upon August last night - what a find! True, its a bit cozy but we were seated in the wonderful back patio area where the space is a little bigger
Our server was wonderful - very familiar with the menu and wine list and able to make excellent recommendations based on what we said we wanted and our price range on wine
We had both the gnocchi and onion tart appetizers and both were absolutely wonderful
Such unique flavors that were paired wonderfully with the suggested wine
The pork entree was succulent, rich and delicious and we finished off with the profiteroles
I was so full I actually, sinfully, left a morsel of my scrumptious profiterole dessert on my plate but I'll be back again and wont eat all day to be sure I can enjoy it to its fullest!! Highly recommended
I just finished dinner have never felt so compelled to write
We had a nice dinner, but within 5 mins of finishing the host came said he needed the table asked us to finish our drinks @ the bar
We were seated promptly there were a few people waiting in the bar, but had ordered quickly been at the table less than 45 mins
When we sat down, the couple to our right were halfway through their entrees - but hadnt paid their bill bc they were enjoying each other's company
The waiter and busboy apologized for the host who claims to have done this many times in his 13 years in the biz
While we enjoyed August in the past we will, under no circumstances, return for a meal
Given the many of great area options, I would implore you to go elsewhere
The menu is interesting but everything we had was too salty and the chef will not accommodate any changes
They were out of a lot of the bottles of wine and main courses do not come with vegetables, all which have to be ordered on the side and add to the overall cost
We were 3 seated at a table for 2 but were finally moved to a larger table
Service is ok
There's better food elsewhere without the tiny tables and oversalted food
Due to the complete incompetence of the manager, we left after waiting almost 2 hours last Fri
night
They have a no reservation policy but the manager seemed incapable of keeping track of the increasing line of waiting customers on the list
Simple organization would have made the waiting much more bearable
However he was rude, constantly confused and almost appeared as if he was not experienced in working in a restaurant
He certainly could not properly manage a simple waiting list
We left after he seated another party who was in behind us after promising we were next
At that point they didn't deserve our money - no matter how good the reviews of the food were
We won't bother trying again
Restaurant does not take reservations
We arrived at 7:15pm on Saturday and was seated in about 15 minutes
Only 2 tiny tables by the cashier machine for waiting

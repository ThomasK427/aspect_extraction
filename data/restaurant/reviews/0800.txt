I am very new to Korean cuisine but needless to say my girlfriend is not
She loved the food
She said it was among the best Korean she's had outside of Korea
Pretty high praise
I found everything deliciously tasty and good portion sizes
Service is attentive
It better be
this place is TINY! Seriously, this place is REALLY REALLY small
But do yourself a favor if you love Korean food (even if your new to Korean) and get down here
Great service made our experience at Temple pretty amazing
The setting was very intimate (candles, flowers, nicely lit), and my girlfriend and I felt that we were treated really well here
The food was excellent and the panchan were FRESH
Cucumber soju cocktail knocked me out! We will definitely go again
If you are looking for a great spot to bring a date or some friends
If you want really good, satifying food but don't want to worry about bouncing your rent check this month
check out Temple Korean Restaurant on St Marks First Ave
I've visited a few times and the traditional dishes are just as great as the more creative ones
Wine and soju cocktails are a great compliment to the dishes
Good looking yet knowledgable staff - nice surprise! The owner/chef is always there - which is a real plus+++ in my opinion
I'll be back
This tiny little place has a huge heart
The staff have always treated us warmly and with keen attention
There's nothing quite like a bowl of their steaming kimchee soup to get you through a cold night
The kitchen consistently turns out well-executed dishes at very reasonable prices
This place gets a star for value
My girlfriend and I (we live uptown) were wandering around the East Village looking for a place to eat, and after peeking into Temple's window we decided to give it a try
Serendipity!! Great, reasonably priced Korean food (she had the seafood casserole, and I, the pork bulgogi), and the spices warm you up for a winter walk
Excellent, accomodating, friendly service as well
The only drawback is that we don't live around the corner --- if we did, we'd be there every other night
Great restaurant, great food - you won't be disappointed
If waiting 10 minutes gets you going then you need to take a chill pill - the servce here is excellent
(BTW what does
so conserve mean?)
If you're looking for some good korean food, good atmosphere, and easier on the wallet than most of those in Korea Town (32nd street), check out Temple
Its also more authentic and definitely tasteful than those other downtown Korean restaurants
Cool place, great service and food!!!
As a strong critic of Korean food, I have to say this is one of the best I've had without having to empty out my pockets for
The dishes aren't overpriced, unlike the Korean restaurants in K-Town (32nd Street, between 5th Ave and Broadway)
The food is like a home cooked meal and the staff is very friendly and attentitive
The kimchee gae (kimchee stew) is a must along with the dumplings
And don't forget to try the Korean rice wine to go with your dinner (Sansachun is one of my favorite)
Can't help but loving the place
I will definitely come back for more!   H

Amazing restaurant! The food is to die for (especially the Vegetarian autumn rolls, and grilled tofu salad!) and the setting is out of this world
The creativity in treating vegetables is unbelievable
I never thought that shitake mushroom, cucumber, avocado, and tofu could work
I couldn't even imagine such a combination
But it works, and works beautifully
Thank God, I live in East Villege to have this restaurant near me
I WILL be back again and again and again
Great dining experience that's easy on your wallet!!! Great place to have a nice and casual korean dinner
Will def
go there again
The food is great, the place is very cool, the prices are good, and they've got this nice down-tempo thing going; all-in-all a good place
However, this all pales in comparison to the service
Friendly, attentive, beautiful, considerate, eager to smile, very warm
I got the feeling that I wasn't feeling up to it, she would have manned the chop-sticks and hand fed me
But not at all overbearing
I think I might be in love
Stay away from her, I saw her first! Seriously folks, its the best
You haven't lived, I mean really lived, until you eat the simple elegance of vegetarian-friendly korean food -- with a spark of wit, beautiful servers and comfortable decor, you will be transported to a time where beauty was a necessity and food was the spark that ignited the night
This is a great choice for Korean food in the East Village
Skip the overrated and crowded Dok Suni and stop by here for good service, good food all for a reasonable price
The music gets a little loud, but other than that, good experience
If you are looking for excellent, home-style Korean food in Manhattan but south of K-Town, you need go no further than Temple
Each time I'm at Temple, I'm astonished at the quality of the dishes and ingredients (their flavorful and boldly spicy kimchi jige (I wake up craving it), a stocky and savory seafood casserole), the carefulness of the preparation and presentatoin, and the inventiveness -- the tweaks (try the Autumn Rolls) that make Temple unique
Finish off your meal with some sansachun, and you're all set
And lunch specials are incredibly reasonable
Frankly, an amazing place -- cozy, warm, and a great location make Temple a winner with staying power
The hospitality and warmth exhibited here is unsurpassed! Pure Korean food at its best! Finally I don't have to go to 32nd St for authentic Korean delights!  The owner is very meticulous and tries very hard to serve each and every customer
We experienced this when our we arrived for our 7:30 reservation on Friday and our a table was not available for the next 10 minutes
We were offered two seats at the bar and were given complementary wine
Food was extremely fresh and tasteful
I was more impressed at the service and courteous staff than the food
Overall, I would recommend visiting this place at least once to try it for yourself!
Some of the best pizza on the UES
Great neighborhood spot with friendly service and good italian food!
This is not your typical New York pizza
it's very thin, so you may be able to eat a whole one yourself! They have AMAZING rolls and a great balsamic vinegrette
As for their pasta, the tomato sauce, not the tomato basil; it's got a tang I didn't like
A bit pricey but good stuff! Service can be a bit slow in the restaurant and they do deliver
We enjoyed dinner in the restaurant and wanted to try delivery
One of the reviews said it was better to eat in the restaurant since delivery was spotty
We think the restaurant read the review - they said 45 minutes, wrote that on the slip, beat it by 20 minutes and the pie was excellent
Salad was boring
oh, well
This place has the best tomato sauce i have ever had
better than my mom's ( i never say that about anything) The pizza, pasta, and bread are all great
prices are also good
service was ok, but bearable for the food
atmosphere is comfortable although i did feel rushed at the end of my meal while finishing my wine
I've eaten at Nick's several times and the food is always high quality, with fresh ingredients
The portions are huge - one large entree and an appetizer or two is more than enough for two people
One note of warning however - the delivery service is often spotty
A few times, they have given us the wrong pizza toppings or sent over a large order when we requested a small
The food really is delicious however, so make a point to eat at the restaurant and you won't be disappointed
This is really a great place and food is high quality and attractive prices
The house red wine is cold and inexpensive
My only grip are the Lights - way to bright and lack of bar

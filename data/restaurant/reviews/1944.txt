Admittedly, the atmosphere and service could use a little help, but we always stuff ourselves here and end up wishing there was room in our bodies for even more
And it's so affordable that it makes it worth fighting the crowds on Canal Street to walk there
I was craving some soup, but didn't feel like settling for the average wonton/eggdrop ordeal
I ordered some vegetable-tofu-seafood soup that was absolutely amazing
The prices are extremely reasonable and the food is superb
I definitely reccommend this restaurant!
We have taken numerous trips here with friends (including my 8th wedding anniversary celebration) over the last 7 years and have consistently been rewarded with good food and and a great time
If anyone has a bad time here I feel truly sorry for them
My friends have come here on their own and my friend's friends as well
Never a bad time was had by any
While I am sure they are more romantic places this place makes for a nice safe bet
Your guests won't be disappointed!!!
My Girlfriend and I love this place
The food is always amazing, and the atmosphere is fun
It's not a posh place, but offers some of the best Italian food I've ever had at a price I can afford
The service is always quick and nice and it always feels like a down home family run
We went to what we thought would be a relaxing lunch and ended up very upset
We were not only misled about the price of the special, but were overcharged
We were so upset that we just wanted to get out
On top of it all, the food and the service were mediocre, at best
And broken English, please!!!
invited 15 people over for dinner and took them to the burrito bar instead
what a great idea! the food was terrific! we loved all of the vegetarian options and the whole wheat tortillas! and we all tried new drinks from the cool drink menu
the back room was perfect for a large group
And we were really catered to -- especially the kids who loved the balloons and crayons they were given! and the bottom line is that i had no problem picking up the tab for all -- this place is a seriously great value!
i know this place has gotten great reviews, but i was not impressed at all
i was lured in by the hippy hour and the groovy exterior, but once i got there it was pretty disappointing
honestly, the best part about this place was the outside of it
once we got inside, the staff was rude and unattentive despite the fact that we were the only people in there
the food sounded good enough on paper, with lots of clever names and interesting choices, but once we bit in, the dishes were all pretty bland
not only would i NOT recommend this place, i'd tell people to stay away
This is the coolest spot downtown for parties for kids and adults
I've been to adult parties there with open bar and lots of great food
The kids parties are fun with balloons and again, lots of food for the kids
Great service, friendly staff and excellent food
A definite 10 all around!
How can anyone complain about this place? I love it
Can't get enough of the FIRE (jalapenos with shrimp wrapped in bacon then chargrilled - arrrgghhhhh - I drool just thinking about them!) The chips and salsa are great
The service is quick and the prices are not dirt cheap, but are certainly fair - especially during hippy hour
I'm a huge fan
This place has amazingly friendly bartenders, staff and the food and margaritas rock
Getting there for hippy hour is a GOOD thing
The potato nachos are fantastic and the all of the burritos can't be beat
The prices just don't get much better and it's never too crowded to have a great time
The beads, colored candles, and 60's parafanalia make it a fun place to be
What a great place in Tri-Beca! Definitely get a tye-dye if you want your exprience to be complete!
Just not that great
The maragitas were
ok (go to El Rio Grande for margaritas that are awesome)
The prices were ok, but not super cheap
Plus the place was empty on a Thursday night
El Cantinero is always going
At least the chips and salsa were good
Not worth the trip
We stumbled upon this bar by luck after we missed our stop on the A train, and this place was fantastic
It's out of the way, no crowds, and the food is excellent
Every tortilla chip in the nachos was covered in cheese, olives, etc
and the guacamole was delicious
I was told the fresh banana margaritas were also out of this world
This restaurant is named after the cuisine of the Chinese dialect it represents: the Teochew or Chiu Chow (Cantonese pronounciation) or Chiao Jo (Mandarin pronounciation) dialect
What is great here is what we Teochew call Mee Pok Ta or Cho Meen in Cantonese
This noodle dish comes in either the seafood or everything version (contains organ meats)
Other recommended dishes are their fishball soup, their Steamed Teochew Duck and their Hae Cho or Har So in Cantonese which is a deep fried stuffed roll
It helps if you either speak the language or know what you want
Get the curry soup: my life's great moments were always punctuated by this wonderful dish that no other restaurant (except Bo-Ky) comes within hailing distance of
Other dishes are great but the menu is very small
The cuisine served is not Cantonese but a variation that is named the same as the eponymous restaurant, sort of Chinese with Vietnamese touches
Beware the stairs to the bathroom!
I stopped in here by chance last night the food was incredible -I got a seafood soup that was fabulous and large I had also ordered chicken with mixed veggies but was only able to eat a bit becasue the soup was SOOO GOOD and filling
Dont let the ho hum decor fool you the food is great
btw they dont accept credit cards -I had to run down to citibank (down the block luckily) but they didnt bat an eyelash they were just like ok bring back the money-where else would you get away wit that??
Really wanted to get a 4-course meal but would have bankrupted me
I settled for the entree instead, which was the very delicious vitello alla sorentino
This was a veal cutlet with eggplant parmesan
Veal was tender and full of flavor
Bread is also excellent
Wait staff was timely, very polite and professional
Ambiance was okay, didn't feel necessarily italian, but overall was a pleasant restaurant
Enjoyed my dining experience but think I am still in search for the best of the best in Little Italy
I'll agree with a previous reviewer that it's a shame Little Italy has become confined to only Mulberry street
Chinatown is getting bigger
The restaurant was recommended by a friend and we left disappointed
The food was above average, however, the service needs serious improvement
The tables in the restaurant are tightly packed (expected for a NYC restaurant
) Howver, we didn't expect to be bumped by waiters a few times during our dinner
When we received the bill, we were surprised that 18% of gratuity was added for our party of four
We paid the full amount and after we got our change, the waiter checked in front of us to see whether there was any money left and embarrassed us by asking where are my tips? when he already got 18% from us!!! That was very rude and after we explained to him that he got 18% already, he checked our bill and tried to make excuses (the computer automatically added the gratuity) and never apologized!!
My general approach to choosing a restaurant in Little Italy involves walking around and finding a place that doesn't have a wait
I've always thought that for the most part, the restaurants serve pretty similar food
Well, I was wrong
The group I was with ended up at Pellegrino's because it was the only restaurant we found where a group of six could be seated immediately, but I'll be sure to visit this place on my next trip to Little Italy
The food was wonderful - possibly the best calamari I've ever had
The only glitch I found was that one of the waiters refused to close the outside door (the breeze was very cold), but the second waiter we asked took care of it immediately
Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised
One of the avarage TOURIST Italian Place
Servoce was great
Pasta was not al' dente just like the other little italy restaurant
China Town is starting to take over the Little italy which is a bit sad for big pasta fan like myself
When I decide to have lunch in Pellegrino's, this is where I almost inevitably end up
The other restaurants in Little Italy are just not as good

Carpaccio was just ok
My main beef with this place was the aloof, too-cool-to-serve-us waiter and the 20% automatic tip that he didn't deserve
I won't ever go back
um no
just because you think you're cool doesn't actually make you cool
Seriously, don't waist you time or money
After all the hype, we had to eat at Butter, but it plain out stunk
It was bright and cold in the dining room and the service was terrible
They sat us in the middle of the room under a gust of air from the vent
When we asked to move to an open booth, they told us that it was reserved for a bigger party
Needless to say we were pissed when a party was sat with the same number of people as us
The food
ok
However, the portions are small and overpriced
I had the filet, which consisted of a hunk of beef on a plate
Definitely nothing fancy
That and one drink put me at $51
After planinnig to stay the night after dinner down in the lounge, you couldn't get us out of there fast enough
Went to Butter this week for the first time
The space is really interesting and the food was wonderful
We got the bill and saw we were charged a 20% service fee
We thought that was a little bizarre because that's usually added for groups of 6 or more people and there were just 2 of us
We asked the waiter if this was correct and he said yes
I don't recall that being mentioned on the menu and it's the first time we ever had that for a party of two people, and we eat out a lot
I don't recall it being mentioned on the menu, and I wish it had
We wouldn't have gotten up to leave, but it's something I like to keep in mind
Other then that it was a great experience
Oh, get the peach and lychee martini
They definitely don't water down drinks!
Personaly I found the decor quite cheesy, the wood paneling surrounding the dining room is plastic wall paper wrinkling at the seams
Anyway this is not terribly important as I went for the food but it was hit and miss
The Kobe (fake) Beef Empanadas were not bad, the crust was soft and the interior nicely spiced and creamy
The entree of Pan Seared Cod though was very bland, considering the cut of fish was only average they could have made it more interesting
The highlight of the meal was the Chocolate Grand Marnier Cake, it wasn't the best but considering the mediocrity of the previous servings I was pleasantly surprised with the richness
I would have returned to try other menu choices but the all around low quality service (I requested salt which arrived after I finished my appetizer) closed the book for me on this place
Me and my wife went to Butter while we were in NYC to celebrate our one year anniversary
It took us about 30 minutes after our reservation to be seated, but we sat at the bar and had a very stiff drink with the bartender
We then were seateed and started out with a very nice Romaine Salad with an assorted bread basket which you get with all meals
We then both had the Grilled Prime New York Strip Steak, which was a very nice piece of meat well cooked with Fingerling Fries, Caramelized Onions and a Barnaise Sauce
We ordered a bottle of champagne and ended our dinner with the Caramel Profiteroles
Our waitress had the chef write Happy Anniversary on our plate which was a nice touch
The service, food, and atmosphere was great and we ended our night by having a drink downstairs in the Birch Room
This is the worst meal I have had in NY since moving here a year ago
and I eat out ALOT
The decor is pretty and the atmosphere is nice in the dining room, but I have no idea what the hype is about downstairs (except for the sweet DJ set up)
The meal was really awful
I got the halibut, which was undercooked, chewy, and smelled fishy
My boyfriend had the beef filet, which was decent, but boring
The service was atrocious (not rude, just non-existant and the restaurant wasnt even crowded)
We were going to order another bottle of wine and some dessert, but we had already been sitting for too long, just trying to get more water, so we gave up, paid, and went home
I always enjoy Butter
whether it's meeting for dinner, a late night drink, or just to chill on a Monday night
Butter NEVER dissapoints
Not too mention, the space is phenomenal
a must see!
Ate there this Sat and had a decent experience
We had a 9:30 rez and were seated by 10:00 after a drink at the downstairs bar
The menu offered a nice selection of meats and the wine list was good but a bit overpriced for the offerings
We just picked from the app menu and my favorite was the scallops with tangerine
This place is filled with the beautiful and stylish and the downstairs room turns into a small dance club at around 12
Would recommend eating upstairs as it got a bit loud downstairs
Stay tuned for Scott's next installment on the NYC hipster scene when he opens club Home
I went to Butter with my family for my birthday dinner this weekend and everyone enjoyed the space, food, and service
I was worried due to all of the reviews I read but was happy when I found them to be off the mark
Butter is a fun place to go if you want a trendy scene and good food
I just went to Butter for Restaurant Week
it wasn't so bad
The food was a bit over salted and the decor is very trendy and great for people watching
Our waiter was pretty attentive (we were missing a fork and he brought it over right away
) I also noticed the table next to ours didn't enjoy her dish and they went above and beyond to try to make up for it
Not a bad experience considering the service standards these days!
Gorgeous unique decor
But I really have to suspect the positive reviews here were written by owners/employees/friends of Butter, because I had dinner there last week with some serious foodies and none of us were impressed
My goats cheese tart was just that, goat cheese in a tart, nothing special
My vegetable risotto was burnt, and infused totally in a burnt flavor
Horrible
Here's the thing, you're in the best city in the world for restaurants
Go spend your money somewhere that really wows you
Just because P Diddy had a party at Butter doesn't mean we should be automatically impressed
Keep your standards high
After reading all the negative reviews I was a bit hesitant about coming here, but I think the food is much better then the other folks gave them credit for
We had the scallop apetzier which was excellent
The scallops were plump and fresh
I had the duck which was served over mashed yams that were out of this world
We also shared the desert sampler and really enjoyed what I would describe as a warm jelly doughnut
I also had the key lime pie martini which was delicious
I would definitely give this restaurant a try and ignore all the negative reviews
Well, I must say that although this place came highly recommended, the customer service was beyond horrible
We went there to celebrate my friend's person
We had about 40 people present, yet management could not accommodate us
No music, limited bartending service, and a bad attitude all in one place on a Friday night
The lower level was closed and there was no ventilation
Lastly, we were unkindly told that it was time for us to leave at 1am on a Friday night
after they made money off of us
Management needs some work
As would be expected from the owners' maxi-club backgrounds, this feels less like an upscale restaurant than just another dim-lit, over-priced, over-hyped club with a scary door guy and service staff complete with the look (and attitude) of super-models
I would reccomend spending your evening somewhere else, unless you are a fan of the scene
Something tells me the scene is elsewhere
Ask to be seated on the main dining floor
IT's the perfect atmosphere for dinner

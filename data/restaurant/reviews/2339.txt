The food was good, but nothing better than I've had at other Italian places on the UES (Luca, Sotto Cinque)
Our waiter snubbed us when we asked if there was dessert (there wasn't), and my meal would have been the same price had it not been restaurant week
Better value, same food elsewhere
This is one of the best all around places to eat in New York
The food is about as good as you get and can compare with any Italian place in the City
The prices at Ninos are a bit high, but you end up leaving with a feeling that you got your money's worth everytime
Service is great and the team of waitstaff make your meal enjoyable
Great experience that is highly recomended
Crowded and loud
Upon entering the restaurant my thoughts were Ugh, this place is tacky and ugly
We were seated and were practically on top of the other tables
My mood started to change when the food arrived as it was very good
Also the service is very good and very attentive
The biggest problem i have is the room, at these prices(top-end) there are many other nicer italian restaurants on the upper east side(Primola, Campagnola, Lusardi's, Elio's to name a few)
Great restaurant with fast service and quality food
I've eaten here almost 5 times and its been perfect every time
Definately make rewsrvations and its great for a large group
The service was great and the food was even better
I would highly recommend this place to anyone
Order the special Lobster Fra Diavolo for 2, it is the best in the city
Whatever you do - do NOT miss the dover sole(Muniere - or as you like it) boned table side
Geriatric crowd - you must have some cash to come here - but fresh flowers and lovely service and TASTY, YUMMY FOOD
Get grandma to take ya!
I thought we were mistaken for someone else
We were treated like celebrities or friends of the family
The food and service were as good as everyone has said but we also were treated to a wonderful complimentary desert and after dinner drinks
We were in a hurry to get to a show so we couldn't linger but I'm sure next time we'll make a night of it
I went to Nino's on a friday night with my family , the waiters made us feel like royalty
Lobster fradiavolo , flambe,hot antipasto
everything was GREAT followed with a nonstop service
I definitely recomend this place
Great place
Excellent service and ambience, and delicious Italian cuisine
Highly recommend the risotto with grilled jumbo shrimp and the house red
Beautiful baby grand seated on the dining floor with good live entertainment
What a great experience
The service was unreal
No waiting for anything
Nino seated us immediately
Attentive, courteous but not overbearing
The kitchen was operating in supersonic speed
Before we knew it the appetizers were being brought and as soon as we were done with that, they cleared up and not a minute later were bringing the entrees
Everything was superb and hot
My compliments to Nino
A really nice surprise
The decor could not be more simple and plain but the food is fresh -- Not over-seasoned and the service impecable with no shi-shi
Ask for the whole broiled Red Snapper and start with the artichoke
Had a party of 4 people plus 2 year kid
Made reservation ahead of time because I heard the place was small
Decor is zero
2 waiters for the whole restaurant, but service was very good
Slow at times, but definitely worth the wait for the food
Kofte kabobs are very good
Hummus and spinach pastries are good appetizers
Prices for entrees range from $12
95-16
Overall great bang for the buck!
This tiny treasure is worth your time - especially if you enjoy Turkish or Middle eastern fare
While small and cramped, the friendly servers work their buns off to serve up tasty treats from the kitchen
Try the Kafta Kebabs and Lamd dishes
very good, indeed
I have been a faithful customer of theirs for over 10 years
For a restaurant to last 10 years in NYC is pretty impressive, so they must be doing something right
The price/quality ratio is excellent, the service good and atmosphere perfect
This is my favorite neighborhood joint
It is hard for me to share this information with other Upper East Side diners but here it is
Uskudar serves authentic home-made Turkish cuisine
I have been a loyal customer for three years now and never once disappointed either with the service or the food
A lot of Turkish dinners could be seen at this restaurant enjoying their familiar comfort food
It is a tiny restaurant with only fifteen or so small tables
It is a perfect place to see what Turkish people eat in their own houses
Try the Yogurt Chicken or the Quails for main course and Sheppard Salad or an Ezme Appetizer
Dont forget the desert
Youll find that Uskudar is very homey and inexpensive compare to other Turkish restaurants in the city
I am hoping that theyll stay that way
We get take-out/delivery from this place a lot, but the little restaurant is nice and cozy
Can ususally get a table right away
the Hummus is great, and the red bean soup is excellent
I've tried everything on the menu and its all good
Its not worth complaining about a bathroom as many others have
Afterall, who goes to a restaurant and judges the bathroom? The wine list? well, thats worth an upgrade! otherwise great
In Short Opened more than 75 years ago, this airy family-owned diner still attracts groups and solos on the Upper East Side
The green exterior paint makes it easy to spot, and the natural theme continues inside with light wood floors and potted plants
As a wall of old New York scenes hints at the history, waiters in the signature-color shirts focus on the present and scramble to serve egg dishes, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, and hearty entrees
I think many people who live around the Green Kitchen used to frequent it
In fact, my family and I used to go every sunday for breakfast, it was ALWAYS frequented
at any time of the day
We visited the newly renovated restaurant this past weekend with high hopes
What we got was very poor service from a terribly unfriendly waitress who didn't know the menu well and a very limiting selection of food
We miss the friendly faces of the staff and the diner like food that we used to get
The old saying goes true in this case: if it ain't broke, don't fix it
I've lived in this neighborohood for 15 years and for the longest time, Green Kitchen was the best standard diner, for hangover breakfast/ burgers/ late night snacks etc
About 9 months ago it closed down for renovations and completely remodeled
Now reopened, the new look is OK but if you can actually get beyond the abominable service (waited 10 minutes for a table 11 AM Sunday with at least 5 tables available, )the food is just lousy
Their omelettes are 1/4 the size of any other establisment around, and home fries aren't even available
Maybe you're trying to be something else? By the way, the prices are about 40% more expensive
I know this must have been a huge effort guys, but I'll take the old Green Kitchen back in a heartbeat
Thoroughly disappointing
Green Kitchen has recently been renovated and the new decor is rather pleasant
However, the diner definitely DOES NOT HAVE their act together (at least not yet)

The hostess neither apologized nor cared to correct the problem
My wife was told It's OK
If the bottom lock is broken you should use the hook on top to lock it
Well, the problem is there was no sign on the door and the hook was way above eye level
It turned out that ppl can still open the door from the outside when the lock button is pushed in from the inside
We all used the restroom and no one saw the hook
I went to check the hook and noticed it was at my eye level being that I'm 6'-1
not a typical woman's view
Also, the restroom is lightly dimmed with candles so good luck finding the hook to lock the door
My wife was insensitively mistreated
Being that the service and food was nothing special and pricey, we will Never go back to this restaurant
We demand an apology
I went with a party of four last week and this was the perfect spot
We sat outside, it wasn't too hot, we split a bottle of wine, and had a great time
The food and service were excellent
We each ordered something different so we all got to sample each other's entree, which included the short rib, the chicken breast, and the monk fish
I had never had monk fish before and I would definitely order it again
For dessert it was the chocolate souffle, and it was awesome! This is a great place to go if you're looking for some different twists on traditional American fare
I went with a party of 4 last week
Our waiter knew we were on a tight pre-theatre schedule so helped us order and served us timely
He was perfectly attentive--and when asked he gave us great menu tips/suggestions
We all had salad or appetizer and a fish entree
I had the Sole which was outstanding-- the perfect light pre-theatre entree
Bartender made a helluva martini, too
Highly recommend!
I've been to 44 X a few times, each time a very pleasing experience -- good drinks, atmoshpere and decent eats -- that I used to recommend it to others
The other night was dissappointing and atrocious enough to have me never to return (there are enough restaurants in NYC that I should try out anyway, yes?) The food came very delayed; appetizers took 20 minutes
My guess is that it wasn't the kitchen's fault, but the chatty-cathy, chelsea-esqe boy-waiter, gabbing with friends at a nearby table and forgetting to bring out our order on time
The foie gras special was chewy, the mac 'n' cheese unremarkable
My monkfish was overdone, and again, chewy
My guests meals also forgettable
But when it came to the check, we were approached three times
I wish that much attention had been paid to us before we got the check
Alas, I do hope that the non-white-ness of myself and my guests did not color the type of service we received
last night i went to dinner here again (and it's been a few months since i had last gone), and the place is still great
food is excellent and waiter was pleasant
i always have a wonderful experience at 44 X (and i also love 44 1/2!)
I echo the other City Search reviews regarding the poor customer service at this restaurant
During my visit, the host was unbelievably rude and arrogant
We arrived on time for our reservation, but when we walked into the restaurant, the host told us that he had given our table away
The host made no effort to rectify his mistake and accommodate our party
Instead, he ignored us and refused to seat our party as other tables became available
I would not recommend making a reservation at this restaurant
We came in at close of kitchen, but they graciously sat us and served us
The waiter was extraordinary
Very conversational and attentive
Best glass of chardonnay i have had here
I loved this place!
I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and have absolutely loved it
The ambience is so nice and the food is always top of the line
It's a great place to take any sort of group--there is something for everyone
Plus, the bathrooms are gorgeous!
I have attempted to eat at this place during the day on 3 seperate occasions
Once during the week when I walked in and had one person say they were serving and another quickly reply No! The kitchens is closed until 5:30
The second time I tried to return for brunch at 3pm-kitchen closed
my fault I should have called
The 3rd time I arrived at 2:40 and was told the kitchen closed at 2:45
What time do you serve until??? I work in the service industry it's not hard to just stay open and change from lunch or brunch to dinner effortlessly- we do it everyday
Your food is very good but I will not be coming back
We've gone by the restaurant so often, fascinated by the way it looks - so inviting, quaint
So we finally went there for breakfast one day
Loved the little muffin basket and they happily gave us another basket (we devoured the first basket of muffins)
The muffins were small - little crusty which made them very tasty
The brunch food was pretty good
not spectacular but not bad - better than average
However, don't botther getting OJ - it's not fresh and whatever they serve tastes pretty bad
All in all, it was a lovely experience sitting outdoors and enjoying the weather and good food
It's nto a busy sidewalk which adds to the relaxing feeling
Best Filet Mignon in the city! Absolutely!!!! Too crowded, better for a dinner PARTY, not a dinner DATE
VERY NOISY!!! A bit too pricy
The food's ok here, but AVOID this place for brunch, dinner or any other time! It's excruciating
The noise level is PAINFUL!! I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there!!
My Girlfriend and I dined there on a Friday night and it wassimply wonderful
We had an excellent table outside and it was a beutiful evening, The waiter was friendly and attentive
My salmon tartare app was delicious and spicy as advertised
Our entees (Fried chicken, collard greens waffles? horseradish crysted halinut) were fantastic
We had an almond cake desert with fresh berries figs that was out of this world
I cannot wait to go back and try the other menu items, Great place for a romantic, relaxed date
I don't know what all the complaining has been about with this place
My husband and I used to frequen this restaurant regularly and after seeing the past few months of reviews - were hesitant to return with friends
I'M GLAD WE WENT BACK! The food was a delicious as ever, the waitstaff was attentive and the ambiance was laid back and relaxing
Whatever was wrong has been fixed and is back to the place I remember fondly
Five years ago my wife and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day dinner here
I don't know what happened, but last night was a prettymiserable experience for an upscale restaurant
It took almost half an hour just to recieve appetizers, by which we'd finished our bottle of wine in boredom
We should have ended the night there, because those appetizers were the best part of the meal
Dinner was lackluster to be kind
And I pretty much had to tell the waiter that when dinner is late, you usually comp your guests something
so they gave us another glass of wine
Gee thanks
It even took a long time to get the check
By then I was willing to pay just to leave
Never again!
X DOES NOT MARK THE SPOT Horrible
obnoxious
and arrogant
without reason
I could go on forever, but these are the 3 words that best describe 44 X
Nevermind that the waiters were non-responsive, non-caring and downright rude
the owner is the same

The food is exquisite, the people are friendly and the staff is always pleased to serve
The head chef is the best around, and the owner is sweet as can be
I have always been treated like family, and I know you will be too!!
The last time I went to this restaurant it was a little mom and pops so imagine my surprise when upon going I was greeted by a gigantic structure that had replaced my favorite italian restaurant in the Bronx
Other than waiting too long to be seated for no reason (there were a host of empty seats)
The food was ok (too much grease) and the atmosphere was pleasant, nothing to brag about
Best Value for the money anywhere
Food is always fresh and hot
They do so much business it couldn't be otherwise
Quality is excellent
They have a steam table to get you in and out
Forget about fast food chains
This is the place
There is not one day this place is not completely packed with people waiting for take-out or for a table to open up
Portions are large and prices are low
It's like eating in Abuela's kitchen but without the mess to clean up afterwards
The you'll like this place
The food is great but I suggest you take it to go because the decor is cheesy, the atmosphere loud, and there is no space
The food is the best though, and that's why the place is always packed
Do not go here, even if you are hungry
The food is bad, the service is bad, and if you spend 20 dollars, the gratuity is included
Frank the owner will welcome you with open arms on any day of the week! Everything they offer from the heros to the homemade pasta dishes are the best money can buy! Take a ride up to Castle Hill Ave on the 6 train and enjoy!!
I am a regular at Luciano's Pizzeria
The sauce is delicious, and very authentic, and the pizza is so fresh, no matter what time of day you go there
The best part is the THIN crust on all slices, baked to perfection
I love it!
If you're in the mood for Dominican or Caribbean comfort food, you need go no further than your own neighborhood
Caridad's locations sprinkled throught the city are sometimes confused with other restaurants bearing a similar moniker
Look for the green awning with the white letters and you're in the right place(s)
How do I know? This Broadway location features parcha (passionfruit juice), pescado colorado(red snapper), sweet or green plantains which are to die for
Pockets a little light? Try any lunchtime or takeout special like the well marinated roast chicken
If you're a rice lover, meals come with white, yellow, or mixed with the traditional beans
I have gone back time and again just for their white rice which is flavorful on its own
I do order other food to go with it, so as not to embarrass myself
The sushi is the best
The people are the nicest and the prices are very reasonable
They also deliver very quickly
The sushi is the best in the 5 boroughs
The sushi chef is the friendliest
He knows everyone by name
He can make any sushi you can dream up
It's just like eating home
The prices are much better than Manhattan
You get served very fast
My husband and I LOVE their food
The rolls that they make fresh daily and place on the table for you while you wait, are heavenly
The pasta is home-made and always al-dente
The desserts are excellent, although expensive
The food prices for a kosher restaurant are acceptable
However, the service is their only problem, as they are understaffed and usualy busy
The food does take its time coming to the table but that is understandable since it is freshly made to order
Staff is rude
Food is mediocre except for the White Chocolate Layer Cake which is fantastic
You can take it out so you don't have to eat it there
Service is really slow
Food is very overpriced
i've been to josepinas many, many times
only once did i have a bad experience, but that was due to a new waitress
other than that, each visit has been extremely pleasant
the owner, who i see everytime i go, is very friendly
the service is both friendly and efficient
the decor is very nice
i love the baskets suspended from the ceiling
it adds a nice touch to the warmth of the place
the music goes well with the decor, usually jazz
and the food is delicious
each entree comes with a salad w/three choices of their house dressings
i love their creamy italian
for my entree my favorite is the hangar steak-beware they tend to undercook their meat-although the other entrees i have tried are all very good
i love josepinas
if you go, you will not be disappointed
Yes it's diner food but it's the best diner food in NYC
The eggs are never greasy and perfectly done
The malteds are delicious
The salads are always fresh
The wait staff has been there for many years and they always get your order right
The sushi here is creative, wonderful and the taste incredible
Its so good you just can't stop ordering
We eat here several times a week
They have a great selection of unusual combinations
Priced very well
Daily specials in case you need some inspiration
Sorrento's is not a sit-down restaurant - it's more like a place to buy a slice
However, they make great takeout
Our usual order is Chicken Marsala, Penne a la Vodka, and garlic bread
Yum
Living in the city, the Sea Shore has the ambiance of Old City Island
Great Sea Food
The One Of a Kind Sea Shore Dinner Is a dream come true
Great wait staff
I find it better on Non Rushed Holidays
Great Evening dining, or a Nice lunch
With Attended parking
The Restaurant overlooks the water
Nice Romantic in the evening

If you want a large helping of seafood, then this is the right place for you
I was there with some friends and I had the rib eye and lobster tail
The lobster tail was good, but I thought the rib eye was better
I had some friends order the Seafood platter for 2 and it'd probably feed 3-4 really

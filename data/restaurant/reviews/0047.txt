I disgree with the anonymous pan of Saigon Grill
My friend took me here and we each ordered delicious soups and Summer-roll appetizers
The small soup (I had La Sa Gao - a creamy Chicken Coconut soup, garnished with fresh chopped basil leaves
) was HUGE and very tasty
The Summer rolls were fresh and delish - and VERY cheap
Lunch for two with tax and tip was LESS than $20
00
My only complaint was the ginger iced tea was too sugary - but the home-made fresh lemonade was very tasty and fresh
This place has become part of a ritual with my best friend
We both love Vietnamese food and I happen to live in the neighborhood so we frequent Saigon Grill every few weeks
They serve enormous portions for reasonable prices
I love their vermicelli with grilled chicken and recently tried the sweet and sour soup with shrimp
Never have I gone there and spent more than 20 bucks between us
nor have I ever left hungry
I have never been to Vietnam, so I am not sure what authentic Vietnamese food tastes like
Some of the dishes in Saigon Grill feel like a hybrid between Indian and Thai
The soup I ordered (La Sa Ga) made me miss the classic coconut chicken soup in Thai restaurants and the maincourse (Curry Bo) made me miss Indian curries
The fusion (?) is interesting and worth a try
This is a great place if you are sick of Chinese and dont wanna shlep to ChinaTown
Its GOOD and CHEAP
They give you huge portions and its fast
Its a great place to bring people and shoot the shoot
Be forwarned though, get there before 8pm or else there is about a 10-20 minute wait
If you are late, dont worry, its worth the little wait
Also, its open late too, which is great
I think I will go there for dinner tonight!
Our second time at Sala Thai was pleasant
We were a group of 8 and well seved
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce
Acceptable prices
I'll be back soon
Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well
The ambience is less than special; however, if you're looking for a filling, above-average Thai dinner, this is the place to go!
I really liked this place
Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater
It was pretty inexpensive too
the waitress was surly -- refused to bring sweetner for my tea!! and when i asked for an extra napkin, she demanded to know why! plus, the food was lousy
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices
the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily
i would just ask for no oil next time
great food for take-out, excellent vietnamese, reasonable prices, however the restaurant is not very exciting to sit and eat, but the food nevertherless is good
Overview Several packages are available depending on the type and time of cruise
Typically guests will see the Brooklyn, Williamsburg, and Manhattan bridges, the Statue of Liberty and the New York skyline
The lunch cruises include a narrated historical tour of the harbor
Dinner cruises feature dancing to live music
My fiance and I recently wanted to see the city and deceided to take a dinner cruise
We selected Spirit cruises because a friend of ours had nothing but good things to say about them, and let me tell you he was right
From the beginning, we were met by friendly staff memebers, and the convienent parking at Chelsea Piers made it easy for us to get to the boat
Once we sailed, the top-notch food and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening
No doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, Spirit and Bateaux will be our destination
Fireworks cruise was bad
Everyone on top deck had to look straight into the cabin to see the fireworks, started shouting quot;Turn the boat!quot; Crew didn't care; other boats on East River were turned
Had wrong station on for simulcast
Entertainment was weak, not needed
Food OK
Mixed drinks were bad, had to switch to beer
Worth doing once but that's it
The Scene Upstairs in a narrow, handsome but oddly shaped space, this serene, refined restaurant caters to a mostly business-oriented crowd that, auspiciously one presumes, is predominantly Japanese
The service is attentive but can be a bit scattered
The Food Every dish shows the care with which it was prepared
Presentation is paramount, as in the chirashi dinner, served in a three-tiered globe, with pickles and rice on the bottom and fish on the upper levels
The daily fresh fish can be remarkably good, served in a variety of combinations, ranging up to the omakase chef's choice dinner
Appetizers, such as sweet grilled scallops with butter, and mouthwatering grilled yellowtail collar, are mostly excellent, though some, like mushrooms stuffed with bland poached fish, fall flat
The kitchen also offers just a few sushi-free entree options, such as a masterful tempura dinner and chicken or salmon teriyaki
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L
A
Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action
I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni
(For those of you who don't know, Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese, which happens to be my favorite
) He served me an Uni Hand roll, which I never had before, and let me tell you
IT WAS HEAVEN! Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc
The sake menu should not be overlooked!   All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll
Average
Completely Average
If you're in town, it's worth searching for another place
The service, however, was a bright flower in a garden
I wasn't there for the Half-Price Saturday Night Special, but Tuesday Night
Perhaps it was an off night, but it was suprisingly average for a 9
3 rating
This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it
I have been to Sushi Rose four times this summer and am always appreciative of the warm service and friendly service
Great food is served in a cozy setting and makes it a wonderful place to catch up with old friends
We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not! The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past
We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past
Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great portions all at a reasonable price
The restaurant could use a little paint, but all in all a great sushi place!
Saturday night is 50% off but so is the menu
ITS HALF OFF! They have a special menu on Saturday nights and it does not include the good stuff
The menu is very limited and does not include a sashimi platter of any sort
It is a departure from what you'll see on the website
What we did get was fresh and well presented except that they forgot the dressing on my salmon tataki
?!?!? Might be a good place to visit on a weekday

The relaxing music and the two French musicians on Thursday night, the candle light and the beautiful garden, make Luca Lounge the perfect place for a romantic dinner
The enormous lounge with comfortable couches and soft candle light again, on the other hand, greatly accomodates bigger parties for either special events or just casual weekend nights
I went to Luca Lounge last Thursday
This was my first time at Luca and I really had a great time there
I do not understand why people complaint about the service when the staff there is so friendly and outgoing
We were 9 people and got our drinks and food fast and everything we asked for additionally was brought immediately
So, as a whole, the service was prompt, the food was delicious, the music was relaxing and we all had a great time
In short-We waited forever, never got the right food or all of the food and were made to pay for it
In Detail-  A few weeks ago my friends and I waited fifteen minutes to sit, another ten minutes for menus, and twenty for a waitress
Our apps were okay but only one entree ever came
We did get food eventually, but it was not what we ordered
We tried to find a manager, but there was apparently not one on a Saturday night
As we tried to walk out, we were made to pay our tab, for the drinks, apps and the one entree
DO NOT ever go here
It was one of the worst dinner experience I have ever had and  will never come near there again
i am shocked there are so many negative comments about the staff
i went to have a birthday dinner with some friends (april 2006) and it was pretty cool
the waitress was a bit weird, but she wasn't rude and they were pretty accomodating
maybe they just don't like americans
haha
but regardless, the food was good, their prix-fixe dinner was very affordable, and dining room has a great vibe
Went to Luca with a bunch of friends to celebrate a friend's birthday
The waitstaff was surly and rude
We broke out cupcakes and candles and were informed we would be charged $15 for them
Had I read the reviews here ahead of time I would have known this! Then the waittress approached the birthday girl to tell her that she needed $15 so I had to tell the waittress to leave the birthday girl alone and that I would take care of it
I would feel different if we were just drinking water and eating cake but we had 20 people drinking multiple overpriced beverages AND one friend had called ahead of time to find out about the cake and no one ever picked up the phone
I tried to have my birthday party at Luca Lounge last night
Things started out ok, we were in the front (about 15 of us) and the hostess/waitress found us some space in the back room (about 6 chairs) in the middle of two other parties
However, when we got in the back room and my friends brought out some birthday cupcakes, I was pulled aside to discuss the $15 surcharge
If they had at least given us some napkins, I might have understood
Then, the 2 bouncers (who are totally superfluous) began hovering around us, since one of the other parties said we were encroaching on their space
I've never felt so uncomfortable- this place needs to stop taking itself so seriously and start paying attention to what people are saying about it
After hearing about Luca Lounge for a while from my friend I was excited to finally try it out
I was so dissapointed
It was probably the worst service I have had at a restaurant
There was one waitress for a busy room, who also was the hostess
This was weird because there were two waitresses standing at the bar eating an appetizer while their co-worker struggled to get her tables water
We received our cocktails (that we ordered early) at the end of our meal
The meal was okay, but not great enough to make up for waiting and the frustration
I walked into Luca with a date last Thursday
Mind you, this place can easily sit 200 people (if not more)
The loveseat at the front was empty, there were maybe 3 people sitting at the bar, and the back of the lounge was occupied by only two small groups, with good 4/5 of the seating accomodations left empty
The hostess sat us at the smaller table with separate chairs and an armrest
Seeing how I preferred to be close and comfortable with my date, I asked the hostess whether we could have the loveseat table over there
After counless requests, she declined to let us sit in a loveseat, even though this place was literally deserted
I understand these establishments have certain code for seating arrangements, but they should hire a hostess with common sense, and a more courteous attitude
I walked out, and won't return
My brother and his girlfriend held a joint birthday party there this weekend
After spending several hours and tons of money, the owner, security and waitstaff completely acted unprofessional
After a sercurity guard tackled one of our guests to the ground (for no real reason), the owner cursed my brother out and demanded we leave
My brother simply wanted an appology and a discount on the nights bill
To be treated by the owner in such a disgusting mannor has simply put a bad taste in all our mouths
I will never return to this place and DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE else to go
Some members of the waitstaff were rude although we had a party of at least fifty people and spent lots of money at this place, the management insulted several people in our party and, when we tried to speak with the owner, he was rude and obnoxious
Avoid this place!
Went with a group and sat in the covered patio with couches
We had a great time and my only complaint was that they closed at 2am and not later
We shared some pizzas
A great relaxing atmosphere, much larger inside that it appears from outside
In all the places that I have gone to in this city, I would rank Luca Lounge as one of the absolute worsts
this past saturday, I was at Luca Lounge for a friend's birthday
The room we were in was completely overheated
then manager came, dragged the birthday girl outside, proceeded to yell at her and demanded a $25 charge for bringing cupcakes in
It was her birthday, her friends had been buying overpriced drinks all night, and this was the reaction she got
Even if there is a rule about bringing cupcakes in (which we obviously did not know about)
there is a way of handling it and a way of treating your good customers
do NOT go to luca lounge - worst service ever, irrational and angry management, and terribly unpleasant wait staff
I want to support the restaurant's in my neighborhood but I keep getting disappointed
I only had the pizza and it was a disappointment
I guess they were waiting to serve all the dishes to our table and so my pizza was ready before all the rest and needless to say my pizza wasn't hot and it was also blah! The other people I was with were overly excited about their meals either
this place is awesome! the food is amazing old school italian
the ower is a pretty cool dude, too!
you'll enjoy Luca
The food is homemade-tasting despite the kitchen's puny dimensions
You must try the Spinach salad with shaved parmesan and green apples with the lemon vinagrette
you won't be sorry
The chicken parm is really good also
Pizzas are okay
Great outdoor seating and fun couches in the back, perfect for groups of 8-16
Only problem is the service and that is hit-or-miss
Just don't be expecting to be in-and-out of the place in 45 minutes
It's a laid-back place and that's what you get service-wise
I'm glad I'm not the only one
Had a couple of rude or incompetent waitresses there before, but most recently the last straw
Went there midnite Sat
, no hostess at the stand, so I ask a waitress very politely if she's seen her, the girl absolutely growls at me like I just interrupted her in surgery
When the hostess finally appears she tells me that she can't seat us on the mostly empty patio because all the open tables are for dinner not drinks
I remind her it's midnight and she offers to seat us on the edge of the dining room
Um
what? We went to another bar a block away with a patio that was open for paying customers
They need to find some staff that actually know how to serve customers
instead of angry hipsters that are too good for their jobs
I didn't eat there, nor did I have a waitress so I can't relate to everyone complaining about the service
I actually WENT to the bar (gasp) to order
Sounds like everyone else that's posted is princessy
This place is pretty chill
Nice garden out back, some couches and is a huge place
Hot has hell and there was no AC
so in the summer it can become a sweat box
They do have old school pac man if you want to see how 'fun' that date is

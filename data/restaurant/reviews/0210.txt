The service was appalling!! Ordered medium-rare steak
Conversation went like this: waiter: presented the steak and said 'Meduim well'
guest: Politely responding; No, i'm sorry, I ordered meduim rare
waiter: 'Oh yeah, I meant meduim rare
guest: After cutting into the medium well steak 'I'm sorry this is obviously medium well' waiter goes into the kitchen and chef comes out, grabs silverware out of guests hands and starts cutting into the steak and pointing, shouting that it was medium rare
Ruined the whole night!
The hamburger at brunch is the best I've ever had - and for a really reasonable price for the neighborhood!
Steak for 2 is awesome - best in the city
Sides are good, the steak is so awesome I haven't taken the time to try the pastas
Good place for a date and not too over exposed in the meat packing district
This steakhouse is really amzing
I am from California and every time I visit NYC I need a fix of the prime porterhouse
The hamburgers at brunch are the best I ever had in my life!
I have been to Macelleria on several occasions and have always had a great experience
The food is fabulous and they truly serve the best steak and amazing fries
My friends and I love the atmosphere and decor here - it is laid back and very cool
The wine cellar was perfect for our group of 10 for dinner last week
It can be extremely busy on the weekends (probably the reason for some of the complaints), but then again it is the meatpacking district! Who hasn't had to wait for a table (even with a reservation) at any restaurant in the area? Try going on a weeknight, if the weekend crowds are not your thing
I found Macelleria on a Saturday, after going to Ashes and Snow exhibit
It was the perfect place for brunch
My 7yr
old son had no problems finding something to his liking
The whole family appreciated the decor, particularly the recycled wine cases
The service was excellent and the food was absolutely delectable
It was definitely worth every penny
So much so, we're headed back there for dinner tonight
I have become a regular customer at this Meat Packing District find
My guy friends constantly crave the porterhouse, and I usually opt for the huge and succulent Shrimp Cocktail and homemade ravioli (like no other ravioli I have ever eaten before in my life!)
While it can get almost unbearably crowded and loud on Saturday nights, I have always found the food to be consistently delicious
I highly recommend it, but try to get there before 8 because the place tends to fill up quickly afterwards
Do not go to this restaurant
The absolute worst service I've ever experienced and the food was below average (when they actually gave people the meals they ordered)
Waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well
Only good news is the bartender makes a nice double vodka tonic
Over priced, overrated
stay away!
our reservation had little impact on decreasing the almost hour it took to be seated - - we were placed at a table in the very back - alongside the kitchen - which at times can be a fun experience - but not when it's in the mid 90s -the butter on the table turns to soup - and we all are sweating profusely - - the restaurant seemed aware of the heat problem and ours was not the first complaint they had heard - asking several times to be moved or if a fan could be moved in - our requests were all ignored and no apology or compensation was ever offered by the staff - - it was a truly horrific experience and would not recommend to anyone - unless of course you're into eating mediocre italian food in the confines of a sauna
Fantastic food - I had the whole baked Seabass and it was excellent
We ate downstairs which is much more rustic less noisy than the street level
Reminded me of a wine cellar
Very helpful service given by a mature, knowledgeable Italian gentleman who was a true connoisseur
Cents, Dollars, I'm happy to spend them here anytime
If your idea of perfection in a steak house is Lugers, Del Friscos or Sparks then give this a miss
The Porterhouse here will appeal to anyone who likes real - ie Argentinian style - Steak
The rest - baby squid, ravioli, etc is also great
Sure the waiters are a little scatty - requiring some 'provocation' and the wine list is not cheap, but I always leave feeling like I had a fun time and wanting to come back
I have recommended this place to many people, and the verdict is generally the same
The rustic atmosphere in this straight from Italia-looking restaurant set the tone for an authentic Italian meal
Unfortunately, our waiter set quite a different tone; he disappeared until the end of our meal, when we had to beg for coffees and desserts
To start, I had the Iceberg wedge with Gorgonzola and the Duck livers
The iceberg was average at best, and slightly bland
The rasberry vinigrette served over the duck complimented the flavor of liver nicely
For my secondi - grilled baby squid
Presentation was below par, but the squids were tender, not rubbery, and the grill added a nice dimension to the taste
Dessert? I'd question whether or not the walnut caramel cake was homemade or storebought
Although many of the dishes here are palatable, there are more Italian restaurants to try in this city - and hopefully at those, we won't be playing hide'n'seek with the waiter
Phenomenal ambience, incredible food
Pastas top notch, and steaks were on par with the best steakhouses in the city
if you live in the west village or just want to hang out in the meat packing district, macelleria is a fine choice
the food is solid (very authentic italian), the room is great, but the service is a bit weak, from the host (who is like leslie nielson from the airplane/naked gun movies) to the bartender (who reminds you of inspector cluseau from the pink panther movies) to the waitress who just didn't know how anything was prepared (although she was new
) i live in the neighborhood and will definately go back
i met the owner violetta and she was VERY nice
Macelleria is awesome
the authentic italian specialties are so tasty and original, and the porterhouse steak is to die for
Call me crazy but i think the porterhouse is even better then Peter Lugers at times
The fresh pastas are on point, As i chew into the tortelonni i feel as if i am in a restaurant in Firenze (Florence)
As for the service it is quite brute, but it is tentative the staff never really leaves you hangin
i reccomend it, especially for partys
We threw a birthday party for my friend here and they did an awesome job
It was in the private wine cellar and we had a prix fixe with appetisers, entrees a cake (which they made) plus unlimited wine, beer and soda for $50/person
I recently went to Macelleria for a friend's birthday party
The food and service were quite good, and the atmosphere was lovely, especially the quieter downstairs wine cellar/private room
I will not go back, however, because of the unconscionable markup on the wine list
A favorite inexpensive wine, Wyndham Estate Bin 555 Shiraz, retails for about $9
99 at most NYC liquor stores
Macelleria has the nerve to jack up that price almost 400%, to $38
I don't mind a restaurant making a profit on its wine list, but this is absurd
This is a cool family run spot in the Meatpacking District
All of the ingredients were fresh, the wine and cheese was top notch and the steaks must be from the meat packing insiders, fresha and perfectly grilled
It was welcoming to get Italian in a cool neighborhood
We found the restaurant and Citysearch, by the way you guys are our bible for finding cool spots
Such a great find! My husband loves the fresh cut meats and lamb chops and I love the fish and incredible Italian vegetables
Now with the nice weather, you can sit outside and enjoy a glass of fine red Italian wine and enjoy the feeling of being in Europe
This neighborhood is the best with the cobble stones still in tact! Macelleria has become one of our favorites!
Easily got a table for two ~1030pm on a Sat evening Although the waitstaff here is genial, they are clueless about service
Our spastic waiter was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, and, thus, slow to take our order, slow to bring us our drinks (they sat on the bar for 5-10 minutes) and slow to get us the water we had to ask for repeatedly
The iceberg salad w/ gorgonzola was missing the cheese except for a very few (0
000001 oz) bits that must have somehow fallen in; the peppercorn oil dressing it was doused in was delicious, but didn't make up for the missing bleu
The frites were *excellent* and made us want to order the porterhouse for two (the only meat on the menu, curiously enough for a meat place)
The place was excrutiatingly noisy, which makes for a very unromantic meal
An excellent experience!! Anyone who doesn't enjoy this meal
DOESN'T KNOW FOOD! Amazing meat, great pasta sauces, the duck is amazing, extensive wine list and friendly service
Great location and atmosphere
Walked up on a thursday night about 7 o'clock and got a table for 4 with no hassle
By the time we left the reat after 9 it was in full swing and packed
Great with friends and would reccomend highly
On a Saturday night we were without a reservation anywhere and we were looking for an Italian place with outdoor seating that wouldn't mind if we arrived in shorts and t-shirts
We stumled on Macelleria and it was exactly what we wanted and was great
We had figs and prosciutto to start which was the yummiest thing I've ever tasted
My husband had sword fish which was very tasty

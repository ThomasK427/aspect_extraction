Amazingly, they honored our reservation seated our group of 14 very promptly
Just look our for the aggressive Sangria selling/pouring each pitcher is a whopping $30!!
It is hard to beleive that this is the same owner as Chicama
The tapas are the worst I have ever tasted
The chorizo was like stale sausages, the paella had rooten cray fish, the octupus was disgusting
I went with a small group of Spaniards and we ended up leaving every on the plates, including the tastless sangria
Hard to beleive anyone eats here, stay with Chicama Mr
Rodriguez
Food was fine, and the place is pretty cool, but the waitstaff was slow and pretty clueless
Worst of all was the rude bartender
Ordered a $9 rioja from the WInes by the Glass menu
He brought it, took my $20, gave me $8 in change
I asked about it and he said, oh we don't have that anymore
the rioja you're drinking is $12
I said, oh that would have been nice to know
He got all offended and said What you don't like it? Sheeeesh
Ok the portions are small the food was not all that
There service was okay
The place was really dark
Popped in to Pipa while shopping in the area - what a pleasant surprise! I was their for Saturday lunch, adn I think that there's a different dinner menu, but everything was great
The butternut squash soup was to die for, the lamb flatbread was fantastic - but the highlight were the unbeliveable chocolate croquettes we had at the end - filled with hot liquid chocolate
Yum
The service was actually quite good, and the decor was fascinating
I'm definitely going back when I'm in the Union Square area
I went with two works pal
and let me tell you
I was lost, clueless and needed help
Luckily, Matt was there to save the day and order the good stuff
Hip hip hooray to him and pipa
I had dinner here on a Tuesday night
The decor is very interesting, kind of sexy
The food was ok, I think my selections weren't the best ones
However, what would bring me back is the wonderful service
The waitress was very polite,sweet and helpful and the staff was all smiles
a great experience!
What a let down
decor may cool and trendy
service was awful
our waiter kept pouring sangria to the rim trying to make us buy more and even took my first wine glass away when I wasnt even done
I still had a 1/4 glass
as for food
yah, it's yummy but portions vs
prices are rather high
(5) small piggy back dates for $10
00 is a rip off
Went to Pipa for the 4th time last night and it was delicious as usual
Terrific red wine sangria and an amazing array of tasty, interesting dishes that you won't find anywhere else
Great vegetarian and meat dishes
Highly recommend the escalivada and any of the flatbread dishes
This is a perfect place to eat and share unique tastes
The service can be a little slow but not enough to be a big deal
I went to Pipa on a Saturday night with a group of ten for a birthday party
We did have to wait about half an hour for our table, but the manager was very nice and at one point sent over a complimentary pitcher of their delicious sangria
The decor is beautiful and the food was excellent
Very good portions of tapas, and the flatbreads were all wonderful
I will definetly go back to Pipa
We sat down for dinner twice at Pipa's due to reccomendations by Time Out New York
We were not disappointed by any means
The waitress was kind and helpfull with the menu
The food was near perfect and prices moderate
the dishes were good and large, the service was very sad!!! first we were given a table right by the window with a view of the street, that day the street side table were empty and the strong light from across the street was blinding
Granted it's been a year, but my experience with Pipa was outstanding
We were originally seated (without a reservation) at a table that we didn't like
When we asked, we were immediately and politely moved to a much better one
Our waiter was immensely helpful and patient
We insisted on trying a selection that he said was not up to par; when we admitted later that he'd been correct, he removed the charge for that selection
The four of us drank two good bottles of wine, savored the food and enjoyed the atmosphere
We'll be back our next New York trip, and hope that our experience was the norm
My dining experience at Pipa was less than memorable
After making a reservation for 2 for patio seating on a Tuesday night, they made us wait for 40 minutes
They claimed another party had seated themselves at our table so we ended up waiting until another table left
We ordered soup and 2 tapas for dinner
The soup took 20 minutes to get to our table and the tapas never came
The food wasn't even that good
I would not recommend
The food was great and the sangria was even better, but the seating was a bit too crowded
It was cool how all the employees' names, even the busboys, were listed on the menu
I'd definitely go back for the shrimp
I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to try Pipa, but if you live in NYC give it a go
The hostess was condescending and the waiter was somewhat absent and unaccomodating (sure, we made a reservation to sit outside but when I asked to be moved indoors after I heard thunder he didn't even try to make it happen, giving me a blank stare and a shrug when I asked what we would do if it rained)
It wasn't horrendously expensive- between the four of us we ordered 4 tapas and a pitcher of sangria, and it came to about $25 per person inclusing the tip
Then again, I don't typically eat a whole lot so the smallish portions may not do it for some
I'd go back just for the mushroom or vegetable flatbread though- they were delicious!
Brought a big group of people to Pipa to dinner and was very disappointed by the SLOW and rude service
I've eaten there several times before with friends and have had no complaints, but if you're bringing clients along, steer clear
We didn't get water at our table for over a half hour, they brought all our appetizers and entrees out at the same time, and the waiter was blatantly staring at his watch while we were ordering coffee and dessert
The food is yummy though
most people base a restaurant experience on food, service, and atmosphere
both food and atmosphere were ok
the service is terrible
i came for my friend's birthday, and the waitstaff was just plain rude
after we paid our $500 tab (for 8 people), the waiter told us we needed to learn how to behave
he was the one who did a poor job serving us and knew he was getting the tip
he didnt think i would do anything about that comment
i immediately called over the manager, who apologized profusely and suspended the waiter
no one is rude me like that and gets away with it
thats the last time i'm spending money there
Decided to try their sherry / tapas tasting menu ($42)
The white gazpacho was stellar - the grilled sardines perfect - the arroz con pollo was competent - the spicy duck confit with foie gras mousse and orange peel intriguing - the goat cheese empanada was a nice finish
The matching glasses of sherry - fino to delux creme - were well matched

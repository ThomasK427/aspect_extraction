I wanted to cancel but they said that I cant because my order is out and gave me 2 complimentary appetizers for next time
I waited another hour before I called very angry and hungry
I told them that Ive been waiting for more than 2 hours! They said Friday is busy and it takes 45 minutes
When I said that I ordered at 8 they repeated the only 45 minutes waiting and the 2 free appetizers
I said there wouldn't be a next time, and they said Good
The food was surprisingly hot considered it was out by 9
They were so rude, will never go there (or order) again!
I had some friends in from town and it was great! There were 7 of us and we sat outside comfortabley I might add
With plenty of plates to choose from we had an awesome sharefest! The best thing of all in addition to the tasty food was our check, $17 each!!!
Jeeb is one of the best new finds on the L

A Thai Tapas restaurant, the food is delicious, just spicy enough, not overpowering or bland
The seating in the back is nice with subdued lighting
While being cramped, you won't even notice as you feast on tapas from $2 spring rolls to $4 dumplings, to $8 marinated beef
That is before even getting to the main courses which are most under $10 themselves
There is even an outdoor garden for parties during the summer

here so there are no overpriced cocktails  Check out the tres cool bathroom while you're there;)
Went there 2 weeks ago
Food is good - is not your ordinary take out thai food, chef added a special twist to it
Also the plates are decorated nicely
More like fusion Thai / French
Try their soup (Don Yum - the sour/spicy shrimp soup), it is very tasty
Place is very small though and not recommended for group larger than 4
But pick this if you want a romantic, yet special dinner
Alex I went there for an early dinner saw the menu was relatively cheap
Nothing on the menu was over $8, except for the seafood dishes (i
e
salmon tuna), which were on average $12-$15
They have an extensive tapas menu that averages out @ $5 each
We ordered the fried crab rolls, but tasted more like mystery pork we didnt detect any hint of crab whatsoever
Alex's chicken basil fried rice my Massamun curry was bland as the day is long
Also, the entree portions were the size of the Tapas dishes
I figured there had to be a reason why the food was so cheap!
Ordered three entrees for delivery
All three were so blindingly habanero hot we couldn't eat what we'd paid for
I love spicy, flavorful food, but this was so intense I couldn't taste anything - my mouth was on fire and my lips and tongue were numb
Maybe you can rise to the challenge, but I would rather enjoy what I eat
Welcome addition to the Seaport
Classic , old school Italian menu
Reasonably priced
Great , friendly atmosphere
Food is delicious
Portions are generous My wife and I have become regulars
Check it out and you will be sure to go back again and again
Pat and Mike make you feel right at home here
Had brunch here, again today
Brunch is a fairly recent addition at Buon'Amici
It is one of the best values in the neighborhood
My friend had the seafood omelet, I had the eggs florentine
They have really good bread here! I have also been here for dinner and lunch
One time I had a pasta/mushroom special that Pat suggested
Pat will always guide you in the right direction! The atmosphere is small and cozy (even better when the TV in the bar area is OFF)
There is always Italian music playing which adds to the ambience
This place serves up standard Italian cuisine with a huge sincere punch! I stumbled upon it one night and when I walked in, I was welcomed with so many smiles, I thought I was home
A quaint little place with budding flowers on each table and Sinatra serenading me and my stuffed shrooms
which are to die for
I had the Chicken Picatta
I wanted to lick my plate
My friend had the pork chop broiled with cherry peppers
This thing is a monster packed with flavor
I left seriously satisfied with money left in my pockets
South street seaport needed a place like this!
I felt like I walked into a friends home
The owners made me feel like I knew them all my life
The ambiance is warm and the food is DELICIOUS!!!
I overheard a woman sitting next to me say
I had to check in the kitchen to make sure my Grandmother wasn't back there!!! Honestly, she was right! The food was great
A small place but it has a feeling like you are sitting at home with your family
I live in the neighborhood and this place is a great new addition
I would definitely recommend checking it out!
I simply do not understand these negative reviews
As a regular customer to Bellavitae, I am there almost weekly
I worked in the fine-dining industry for 8 years and frequent many of the city's best restaurants
Bellavitae is a wonderful restaurant and my favorite Italian in the city
The food is authentic Italian like you would find in Italy, NOT Italian-American
There is no sauce served with the 'meatballs' or polpettine
The pasta is cooked al dente and the menu is written mostly in Italian, with English translations following
As someone who has spent time in Italy and eaten at most of the city's finest restaurants, Bellavitae is the most authentic in Manhattan
The food is simple and yes, the portions may be on the smaller side, but these plates are made for sharing, so you sample a little bit of everything
The menu changes almost every day and they serve mostly seasonal items
Take a look at the other reviews of this restaurant in New York Magazine and the NY Times, the general assumption is that the Italian food here is excellent
Although, be forewarned, it is not your typical Italian-American restaurant, and if that is what you are looking for, Bellavitae may not be the right place for you
Regarding the service, I usually sit at the Chef's Bar in the back and have always had fantastic service
The staff is mostly native Italians and very helpful and kind
They provide friendly, relaxed service and I am disappointed and shocked to read that other people have experienced otherwise
I am always welcomed with a smile and friendly, Ciao, and thanked when I leave
I have always received excellent service here and look forward to seeing the employees when I return each week
Bellavitae is one of my favorite restaurants
I have brought friends, clients and family to this restuarant and would recommend it to anyone
I would have to agree with some of the other reviews: Bellavitae has good food, but the service was truly horrible
Skip the appetizers, they were nothing special and way overpriced for what you get
My entree (sliced steak) was excellent, and the pasta dishes looked good as well
Dessert (gelato) was also quite good
But, we had the most obnoxious, condescending waitress ever
She made us feel very uncomfortable throughout the meal

Reception at the front is rude
I was there 2 weeks ago on crutches
Made a 9pm reservation, arrived exactly on time
Was told to wait 15-20 minutes
The hostess' manner was cold, rude and frankly, unacceptable
There was no where to sit and no one offered me a seat
You are better off dropping $200 at a 4 or 5 star establishment rather than at an amateurish venue like this
The service is not very good, but I find that we try Atlantic Grill at least once a year
The food is excellent
The sushi and fish are amazingly fresh
Everytime we've been there, they have had to make up for the lack of service
One time, they brought over every single dessert they had on the tray to apologize
Not bad! Hopefully this time, everything will be excellent
For the price, it should be!
This was the worst food imaginable! The locals are writing these rave reveiws for this place
All the food was cold
Service was non-existent
Decor is great but for $200
00 for two people and 1 glass of wine a piece
I almost didn't want to pay
I honestly think I was scammed
What a terrible evening I had with a great date
This place SUCKS!
The Sunday evening that I was here was quite busy
Yet, my party was seated seated promptly, and our waiter was very attentive
Don't go here for sushi, but for one of the other lovely seafood dishes, i
e sea bass, swordfish
Really great wine list, and the desserts were divine
I would go back here again definitely
I loved the place, our server was very attentive and effective, serving and removing quickly and always asking if there was anything else we needed and how everything was
LOVED LOVED LOVED the sushi, weird combinations that turn out to be absolutely fantastic, they change periodically but be sure to check them out!
Atlantic Grill has outside seating but don't try to make a reservation
The overly chipper person who answered the phone told me that I can not reserve an outside seat
The dining room is crowded loud so outside is the best option
This is the second BR Guest foul up for me
Get the Red Snapper if they have it
It is the best dish I've ever had at any restaurant that serves fish hands down
The food at Atlantic Grill rates a 9
The appetizers were great as were the entrees
The wine was great
The only thing missing was the service unfortunately
It was like our waitress was somewhere else mentally
I would go back as long as I requested one of their best servers which I am sure they would do after we let them know what happened the first time
And we will be back!
Atlantic Grill has one of the best menus for fresh fish I've seen
I only had lunch here, but i had great shrimp and a spectacular lobster, and the dessert was heavenly
There was a nice atmosphere except for the few pompous patrons who looked way too gaudy or a lunch time meal, but overall its a great place to eat
Aside from the Yuppies and Wannabes buzzing around the jam-packed bar, this is the place for an elegant, fresh seafood meal
Definitely call first for a reservation or you may have to wait a looooong time
You can also go in the summer when it is slow and more empty
Try the Sea Bass, Halibut and DELICIOUS sushi
Good for Bruch as well
Beautiful Chilled seafood platters (and I don't eat shellfish) that would make a Kosher person convert!
this is the best sea bass I have ever had--absolutely amazing
the restaurant is big, and not a whole lot of seating by windows, but you agree to that when you go
otherwise, service was adequate--not much personal interaction, but I will attribute that to our waitress gauging us (I was with family and were were talking amongst ourselves)
It was busy so I understand it taking a little time for our second glass of wine or water, nothing too annoying
I'm going again tonight!
This place is good but food and service is presented for the masses, not much personalized service considering the price tag and that it is a  full-evening-out type of dinner place
Fish was fresh tasting but not really tantilizing with flavor
At least the upper east side has one seafood restaurant up there, so you really don't have much choice if you're up there and craving seafood
GREAT FOOD, NICE AMBIENCE, GREAT MUSIC, GOOD SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD AGAIN AND AGAIN
SOME THINGS LAST FOREVER
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
This restaurant being the same ownership as the famed Bliue Water Grill and Ocean Grill, is known and reputed for the freshest and tastiest sea food in town, no doubt, by far it keeps up to its reputation
The food is excellent, the service and ambiance equally up to its standards, just make sure to make reservations, this very popular and always crowded swanky restaurant can have long waits!
The food was absolutely lousy
The skate was grey, undercooked, and tasteless
The tuna was just as bad
Only the spring rolls and the dessert were edible
We were right on time for our reservation (it was our anniversary) when we were told it would be 10 minutes
So we said we would have a drink at the bar (the only redeaming quality or value in the whole place was the bartender and the big vodka sour she made me)
The hostess forgot about us and gave our table away
Then she seated us in front of the kitchen in the entryway to the restaurant
THe worst seat in the house
Then she proceeded to sit walk-ins in the nice part of the restaurant toward the back
Horrible service and food
I would never go back nor would I ever recommend it
When I ate here the atmosphere was great
Everything was clean and the white walls and tent like area was warm
The food was great too, especially the dessert
WOW! amazing fish, great atmosphere good wine list
i recently went here for the first time, and i was pleasantly surprised
good place to go on a date - very romantic
a bit pricey, but worth it for a special night
seafood, especially the lobster rolls in the city
Go for the prix fixe dinner-its a steal
Great overall seafood house
Nice atmosphere
Great service
A near perfect dining experience!
I have eaten here for nearly three years, with firends with family, the service is great attentive and informed, perfect for Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays
Dress is smart and affluent, with a chic in crowd
Patrick, the head maitre'd, is a great host
The food is always superb and fresh with a great seafood selection
Book a table a few days in advance to score a booth
I always rave about this restaurant
Everythign we ordered was amazing and so fresh
It is a beautiful atmosphere
Definitely a trendy place

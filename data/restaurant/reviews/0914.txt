And the carrots are so tender
And I also love their fried plantain won tons!
Stopped in for some appetizers and was very impressed
Very attentive service - though it wasn't crowded
Most importantly, the best vegetable spring rolls I've ever tasted, perfectly crisp wrapped in refreshing lettuce and mint
The papaya salad was refreshing as well
Great on a warm summer day and a gem of a restaurant in an area with an overabundance of diners
They recently changed their lunch special
It used to be for $10 u got half a sandwich and a noodle soup
Now it is a noodle soup and some sort of spring rolls OR sandwich and a soup
This is not a good value and the spring rolls are not good
i used to go for their lunch special all the time but now i feel ripped off
Im sure they were still making money on their old special
I no longer go there
if you live in the area, try their delivery service
quick delivery, food is in good plastic containers
i also like their cocktail menu and dessert menu (try the black tea rose ice cream and the coconout waffles)
great beef dishes such as flank steak salad and beef vermicelli
a very casual place to have good, cheap food
The best resturant in the neighborhood
The best Asian food I have ever had
Start with one of their signature cocktails, try the short ribs or eggplant app, and then move onto the Hanoi fish and fried rice for a great meal
Just remember to bring cash
I live in the neighborhood and have been to Bao Noodles dozens of times
It easily has the best Pho in the city
Service is always amazing and the atmosphere is light and fun
A great place to go to have excellent, fresh food and conversation
Many interesting fish and chicken dishes and unique desserts
Casual and always reliable, portions are sizeable and well worth the wait! I have brought many different types of people here and all find it excellent!
the restaurant's atmosphere is nice and the menu looks good but it's small and crowded
we waited over an hour for a table! the hostess was very friendly to us and apologized for our wait
when tables opened up, the manager sat another party before us
he came to explain but was extremely rude! therefore, we left and ate somewhere else!
This area of the city has been a bit f a black holeof restaurants
pubs and comfort food but no culinary wonders
This place looked very promising from the outside with it's trendy decor and active atmosphere
Unfrotunately the food wasn't very good
I went twice and got two basic chicken dishes - one was tasteless and covered in skin and the other was so spicy that I couldn't eat it
The bartender apologised for the 2nd dish but it was too late
Stop by for a drink but skip the food
The Scene The space features a small dining area in the front room, another one upstairs and a huge balcony-ringed one in back
Passing the long bar at the entrance, customers are greeted with prim warmth: There's a hint of dissonance between the stiffness of the decor and service, and the casual mode suggested by the tapas-style drink-and-snack system
The Food The menu consists of a sizeable number of small-plate offerings, all based on a Spanish flavor palette, featuring smart, creative combinations
A saffron-colored warm salad of cauliflower, clams and raisins is pleasingly varied in flavor and texture; tuna tartare scented with smoky chorizo is another clever idea
Peppers stuffed with creamy rice are excellent, and a wine-pomegranate reduction gives rare strips of sirloin a delicious, bloody tang
A soft sheep cheese with quince paste makes a perfect, subtle finish; likewise fried goat cheese with lavender honey
Went there last night and really liked it
They have some really unique dishes that you won't find anywhere else
We tried four tapas and really enjoyed them all
I liked this place a lot
We found the service to be terrific initially
They brought out our order in record time
Then a party of 12 came in next to us, and the speed ground to a halt, but hey, you can't blame the waitress really
I mean, she suddenly had the equivalent of six more couples besides us
And still, service was mostly okay
It wasn't super expensive
We were pretty happy
I went to Alta last night and had no trouble getting a table for two- it was not crowded
The atmosphere is great and the restauarant is both lovely and comfortable
The food was delicious but it took a very long time for us to place our order and to receive our drinks and dishes
I would say we waited at least 25 minutes between servings
At one point after we had been waiting for over 30 minutes for our last three dishes we were finally able to get our waitress and it turned out they forgot about the rest of our order
The waitress apologized for the long wait and said they would give us some free drinks or desert since they forgot about our orders but we never received anything and by the time we got the bill we just wanted to pay and leave
We wouldn't bother quibbling over the price of a few drinks anyway but I wonder why they would offer if they weren't intending to back it up
I eat out a lot, I never write reviews and I am not picky about service, but I was so disappointed with what happened at Alta I felt compelled to write something
But to be fair the food was excellent and I would go there again for the food and hope last night was not typical of the service there
I have been here a couple times and the food is great
The wait staff is pretty good and the sangria is delicious
I especially love the dates wrapped in bacon
Although overall I do really enjoy the food and decor at this restaurant I was pretty disappointed because on my last visit I accidentally left my credit card on the table and the card was stolen
We were one of the last tables that night so it is possible it could have been other diners but it is unlikely
I realize these things happen but when I called the restaurant to let them know I was very disappointed at the reaction I received from the management
I was told that I didnt leave it there but I probably dropped it on the street (which I know is not true) and that it is impossible that someone from their restaurant may have taken it
For the safety of future diners and their reputation, one would think they might consider this rather telling me that a black card has been left there previously and nobody took that therefore why would they take my card
I am not one to write reviews but as someone who goes to many many restaurants in this city I was very disappointed by this restaurants management
Want my review? !!!!! I Wouldn't send my worst enemy here!!!
Went here on someones recommendation and everything was perfect
The waiter recommended some dishes and we all shared
The food was great and everyone had a good time
the place is cozy even when it is packed
I would definately go back here
Our group of 8 had about five small plates that we thought were the best on the menu
Try the beef and - for the love of God - try the brussel sprouts
Pretty incredible
Who knew brussel sprouts could be that good
Also had a bottle of Spanish Rioja that was a great accompaniment
Pist-dinner, we hung out at the bar
While skinny and a bit trafficked, it was a great way to wrap the evening
this place is great
i went there with four friends on saturday night
we had a lovely table, great wine at a reasonable price, and tried ten of the small plates - all wonderful
we stayed for nearly four hours and were not pressured to order more food or to leave
the atmosphere inside is perfect for a cold evening
i live in the village and my girlfriend and i who love tapas, tried alta for dinner friday night
we were both a bit disappointed
the food is just average compared to tapas in the city
the portions are miniscule
for $13
50 you get 5 gnoochi's low on flavor
my gf loves monk fish, but was unimpressed with alta's version

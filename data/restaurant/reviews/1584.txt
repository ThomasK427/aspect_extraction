The owner is also super nice and very attentive and everyone is so friendly and ready to get you whatever you need
Don't miss this little gem
I have never posted on Citysearch before but just had to after I had THREE amazing experiences here
this is the BEST sushi I've ever had- and I'm a discriminating food snob
I love it here
Their rolls are creative and eclectic- they mix the most wonderful flavors and have very inventive combinations of sushi-- but they're not overly ambitious (some sushi restaurants I find try to be too creative or modern with their sushi
and the result is too often an overflavorful mess)
HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended- Nothing compares to Ginger
I was there a couple of months back
Service was good
There were some interesting rolls
However, the manager was too personal and he never seemed to stop talking
Telling me and my friend how we should decorated our room in order to have good luck coming our way
I found that a bit annoying
Please let us enjoy our food
Isn't Muse similar to Red Head? I thought Prince, Queen, and King are the same with different names
Service is good but I don't need the free food
The tuna tartar gave me an awful taste like glue
I have been eating here since they first opened and the fish and food are always fresh and delicious
I can honestly say that Ginger has not lost any of the charm, originality or high quality service that makes them one of (if not the) best Japanese restaurant in Manhattan
The food is great and service wonderful
My wife and I live on the upper west side, and we go down to the east village just for the great service and unique sushi
Ginger has some of the most delicisious and funky rolls in the city
The King, Crunchy and Muse are my personal favorites
They deliver too! Staff is extremely attentive and friendly
I'd recommend it to anyone for all occassions
I went to Ginger for the first time last night and the rolls were a good size and very unique and tasty! Must try is the Banana Crunch Roll
Staff was very friendly and courteous
Restaurant is small and cozy
Very reasonable prices and great value! Definitely going back again!
Creative menu, yummy food, EXCELLENT service, quiet and cozy dining room
What more is there to say?
I went to Ginger the day it opened and since then have been going back at least once a week
It is absolutely the best Japenese for the price in the city and I LOVE Japenese food! The muse roll is addictive, the tempura is light and crispy, and the yaki udon noodles are a great
The staff is so friendly and it has a real nieghborhood feel to it- they remeber our order and how we like it cooked whenever we call
Go now before the word get out!
Ginger is a little oasis in the noise of the east village
While they have all of the basic rolls and Japanese dishes, the reason to go to Ginger is for the unusual ones
The Banana Crunch is the right mix of everything - sweet, spicy, mild and crunchy and the Seared Tuna appetizer is amazing! Everything is simply designed but completely beautiful, in a wabi sabi kind of a way
The service (and the owner) is very personal and friendly
They also have a great selection of saki - I really enjoyed the unfiltered one
Really creative rolls
and a very peaceful environment
Try the banana crunch roll, it is really an experience! but beware of the tuna with jalepeno
it's really hot and half-filled with jalepeno
i would definitely go back, for the price and the interesting sushi
and so does the sashimi, crunchy tuna appetizer, and just about everything else! Octopus roll wasn't best I've had, but everything else I have tried in the 3 times I have been there (so far, definitely going back) has been fantastic
Ginger offers some of the best and most creative rolls I have had in the city
I went to Ginger on a sushi-loving friend's advice and was not disappointed
The fish was fresh and the combinations inventive, the service was doting (though a bit slow), and the ambiance spa-like
A real treat for the price
Try the spicy tuna hand rolls -- they won't disappoint
Had take-out from here a few weeks ago
Not just your average rolls
If you are content with the basics, you need not explore Ginger
I you are ready to try new, inventive rolls (Crunchy roll w/banana is just one) you must explore! Reasonable prices as well
Ginger is a fine choice for a moderately priced sushi joint
The staff is quite friendly, the decor is peaceful, and the food is fresh, tasty, and fun
the banana crunch rolls, granted not very traditional, rock my world
I was pleasantly surprised when I happened to stop in here with a friend one night after our reservation at a place nearby was mysteriously canceled
The food was really good
I remember we both remarked on the freshness of the fish, and how lovely the decor was
The service could be better, perhaps a little more attentive
But the tuna tataki and the sushi rolls (we ordered 4 different ones) were all delicious
And the price was right
I had never heard of this restaurant before that night, but I am not surprised to find the place full every time I pass by
I love this restaurant! I have lived around the corner for the past 2 and 1/2 years and I have both dined in the restaurant and ordered take out a million times
The staff is incredibly nice and always very accomodating and the sushi is amazing! I am obsessed with the shima roll and i get it almost every single time
Watch for the Kirin festivals too, which are awesome because they have $2 pints and unlimited edamame
Great sushi at moderate prices ! They do not take reservations and it's always crowded, the service was somewhat slow but not terrible but the only thing I really did not enjoy was the fact that the food to our table ( party of 8) was all delivered at different times and was certainly akward
However, the excellent sushi and the prices makes up for everything!
Shima delivers excellent sushi at very reasonable prices
They offer Edo-style sushi, where the pieces are already seasoned
It can get crowded, but it's one of the best places in the East Village
i lived for five years in the area around Shima and the restaurant became a favorite place for me to have birthdays and special occasions
i believe they have the best california roll i have ever had and I enjoy their tuna tataki
i especially enjoy the waitstaff whom treat each table with care and time
yuki and mi hoh are great hosts and the sushi chefs know what they are doing
try the sake sampler for a treat
i am enticed by reading all the great reviews but again i have been disappointed
the sushi rolls are good, not great as raved by other reviewers
they are busy so the person who rated this a 3 for pick up had a poor experience
i would agree with their poor impression, but should not be an indictment on their food
SUM IT: i always say try it once but don't read the overly hi rated reviews until you can judge for yourself
It's a wonder why this place is relatively unknown, the sushi is delicious
So is the tuna tartar appetizer and the miso soup
Mmmm
I'd recommend the Shima roll
It's great
The only bad thing is the absense of tempura icecream
but then again, the sushi is more then worth it
Ahhh
Shima
My favorite restaurant
The crunchy tuna tartar is spectacular, the salmon soup is so filling, cheap and delicious, their traditionally marinated sashimi practically melts in your mouth and don't get me started on the ring ring ring (that's fried calamari to you newbies)
Fast friendly service, freshest fish, huge variety (try the spicy california or tuna rolls) and extremely reasonably prices
Romantic lighting but also great for larger groups (8-10 max)
Highly recommended
Shima's Spiny Tuna TarTar is officially the greatest appetizer in human civilization
This has prevented me from eating almost anything else in the restaurant

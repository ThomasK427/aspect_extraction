Why bother with this one?
David Copperfield's has a great selection of beer, but the food is really below average -- way too overcooked
The staff is overbearing, as are the managers or whoever is bossing the staff around
It's nice to be asked if everything is OK -- it's annoying when it's asked 4 times by 4 different people at an average bar hangout
The would be better off being more hands-off towards their customers
Not worth making the trip to York Ave
unless you are in the neighborhood
Visited New York a couple of weeks ago to meet up with friends for a reunion
For dinner they chose David Copperfield's because of the extensive beer selection
We all love beer
I wasn't disappointed
DCs has 30 taps comprising the spectrum of local craft brewers: Ramstein, Heavyweight, Southampton, Brooklyn and Victory
Also, west coast and mid-west classics liky Flying Dog, Stone, Northcoast and Rogue
Belgiums and vintage English beers were well represented
The bottle list is one of the best I'v seen, and I travel a lot
Food was solid: my ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious, and the appetizers shared were tasty
Service was good overall, considering how busy the place was that Friday night
Overall, the place was great
I'm trying to think of one thing that wasn't great so as not to give such a glowing review, but these guys hit on all cylinders
NYC's place for beer
There are many bars and hangouts in the city but I have to say that this is my very favorite spot of them all! My friends and I were bar-hopping on a Saturday night when we came across David Copperfield's
Who would've guessed that this place on York avenue would be such a treasure chest of beers
Having quantity is one thing but the assortment of what they had was out of this world
There were more special beers on tap than anywhere else I've been to
Beers that we've never heard of previously
Out of curiosity, we gave several a try and to our amazement, they were all yummy! Wow!  The food was scrumptious and the bar tendress was very friendly and knowledgeable of what they have
Great place!   That
I have been to all the popular Beer Bars in New York, including DBA and Gingerman
As an overall experience, I have to give Copperfield's the top spot
Why? Thirty draught beers representing the best of the regional micros, carefully selected imports, and you can even get a Coors Light for your lame friend
Very thoughful menu pairs well with their fine and noble beer selection
Beautiful vaulted brick ceilings and ornate woodwork give the place a beautiful ambiance when combined with the Bluesey rock they play on their sound system
Combine this with dart boards, big screen TV for the special sporting events and Golden T for entertainment, and you have a more fun beer bar
Another plus? Large, clean restrooms
Try to compare DBA with that! Nice, knowledgable staff, beer tasting events held twice a month, and hands down, this is the best of beer bars in Manhattan
Yes, it's the Gingerman without the cigar smoke and the attitude  Fantastic beer selection and specials all the time
Two for ones on Tuesdays  Food's pretty good too, and not just pub faire either
Try the salmon or roast chicken
My friends couldn't believe the great beer selection! We are lucky we live in the neighborhood, because their Monday night hot wings special and Tuesday twofers are the best bargains in the city
Good looking waitresses and bartenders offer excellent service as well
Food is overall pretty good, and ambiance kicks ass on most of the trendy places downtown
Wow, what a great beer bar
Ambience was perfect
My friends and I went to their Oktoberfest week and drank lotsa liters! They had more Oktoberfest beers than I knew existed
And the staff
they were all so friendly and fast
The food was a cut above too
Everything tasted so fresh
If you are on the upper east side, I recommend it
Copperfields remains the best place to get beers with friends on the UES
The food is solid and the beers are great
Having been a regular for more than two years, however, it seems to me that the new management is missing the point
Heavy staff turnover has taken a toll; the bartenders used to be far more knowledgeable and had a better rapport with customers
The new bartenders (and especially the overly involved hostess) are more of an annoyance than an asset
The jukebox is great, but now it is usually turned off in favor of too-loud music
In short, in trying to become more trendy David Copperfields is slowly losing the things that made it the ideal neighborhood place
Great place, quiet at times, but one of the best places to get together with the boys from the frat to drink some beers and take some shots! The bartenders and waitresses are sexy too
In Short This come-as-you-are, cozy Italian restaurant does brisk business serving focaccia, pastas like penne with pesto and brick-oven pizzas topped with the likes of shrimp, capers and fresh tomato
The large dining room is frequently crowded with groups who have just caught a flick at the Sony New York Twin theater across the street
Sidewalk tables go quickly on warm nights
They say first impressions count, and from the minute I walked into this place to the minute I left, the staff here was incredibly rude
The host/maitre'd treated us like idiots and acted like he had better things to do than help us
The waiter was ok, but the bus boys were rude, bumping into you every time they tried to slam something on the table or pick up a plate (that sometimes we weren't even finished with yet!)
It's way too crowded and loud and the food is very overpriced for the quality/quantity
I'll never go back!
I will admit, this place does a business, however, I can't understand why
There is always a wait, the employees are rude, and the food is not anything special
Also, it is loud, and the tables are cramped together, but it is good if you are going to people watch, as the eye candy is above average
Love it love it love it
I live about 35 min away from this place and I am willing to go every week
What makes me love this place, is the food
It is simple, fresh and not complicated
No funky stuff
Their Tagliolini al salmone is wonderful
Pasta is al dente (the way it should be)
Thier salads are fresh, delicious and they offer a variety
The carpaccio is excellent, simple and fresh
It is by far one of the best restaurants in New York
The food is served quickly
The down: Sometimes there is a wait and they don't take rsvps :( The wait staff is so-so
Sometimes it is tighly packed
But the food is worth it
P
S
It's not the place to go if you want a relaxed, quiet, roomy and friendly atmosphere
they have an amazing thin crust pizza
food is great!!
Have you ever been banned for life from a restaurant for nothing worse than taking 2 hours over a 3-course meal with wine, and playing with a napkin? Well that's what Mediterraneo did to me, after 4 years as a very regular customer
Of course, this was after I questioned the fact that the minute we had paid the bill they laid the table with fresh silverware and napkins right in front of us, never once asking us first if we'd mind leaving (and there was no line)
The food is great - but expect to be treated like a criminal, if they even bother serving you at all
We're not such fans of italian, but Mediterraneo (the less casual sister of neighbor caffe med) is certainly a favorite
The restaurant serves wonderfully fresh pasta dishes and pizza, prepared to perfection
This is certainly not an establishment that serves hoards of overcooked pasta, so go elswhere if this is what you want
The ingredients are carefully selected and pair well with the offered wines
My favorite pasta dish Taglione al Granchio, includes fresh lump crab meat and is deelish! The thin crust pizza is, by far, the best and not heavy
The servers have consistently been friendly and personable, while the ambience of the restaurant is very characteristic of an integration of mediterranean and upper east side cultures! A perfect pair
I live very close to Mediterraneo and had always wanted to try it, but I'd read several poor reviews and so I was a bit hesitant
After experiencing the place first-hand, however, I have one comment for the complainers: you know nothing about italian cuisine
Pasta should be al dente - not mushy - and it is cooked to perfection at Med
It's not too noisy - it's lively and not at all stuffy

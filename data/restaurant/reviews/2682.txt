The food is the real stand-out - plentiful and flavorful
My friend and I both took home enough food for one more meal
The prices are incredibly reasonable especially compared with Manhattan prices - complete dinners and beers for two came to about $45 with tax and tip
I was pleasantly surprised by the cucumber salad and the Szegedni goulash (is that the right spelling??) was fantastic
The back patio is small but cute and probably a nice alternative to the Beer Garden if there's only 10-12 in your group
The beer is excellent (esp
for those who know that Coors is not really a beer)
Food is good and the bar has this nice Cheers feeling about it
Make sure you check the outside seats in the courtyard - we liked them a lot
attitudinal waitresses
skimpy portions
outrageous prices
That's Zlaha Praha
It's a good thing they're the only Czech resto in town; if they were competing in a bigger league (i
e
Chinese or Italian) these guys would have gone out of business months ago
For pub grub it was very flavourful
The ham rolls with horseradish cream were nice - the potatoes cakes with ham and apple sauce were flavourful from the drippings they were cooked in
The duck was well prepared, the red cabbage sweet and the dumplings moist, light and airy - perfect for mopping up the sauce from the duck
Tried a pilsner on tap - I'm not a beer drinker anymore
No Moravin reds or white - but the Hungarian Bull's Blood was robust
Will go back this fall to try their Hungarian salamis and goulash
In Short Despite the tacky Hellenic decor, replete with faux columns and signs of the zodiac carved into plaster walls, this Greek restaurant and bar bursts with authenticity when it comes to menu and atmosphere
Its two massive rooms are frequented predominantly by Greeks who chow down on traditional mezze--spinach pie, feta cheese and stuffed grape leaves--and entrees--kebabs, sandwiches and pasta dishes
At night, Zodiac transforms into an area hot spot, featuring live Greek music to entertain the well-dressed and well-lubricated crowd
It was a very good restaurant
The music began at 10:30 pm and went on until well after midnight (we had to call it quits long before it ended)
The evening we attended a country Greek wedding reception was being held upstairs, with Bouzuki (sp) music, country dancing, and a great deal of celebration
It was a good place for couples, families with children, and anyone who enjoys a good time
It is a cute place to hang out and grab a cup of coffee
however it has more of an older crowd, and is rarely crowded
They don't have music, and the service is very slow
The one plus is that they do have Valet parking, which can save you a ton of time in Astoria
Simply tip the guy $2-$3 and you are all set
I liked the looks of this place, but was not impressed with the food or drink
The octopus salad I had was chewy and tough and the drinks were not impressive
i work at the hospital and agree its very average and sometimes not great at all
For the money, this sushi place is great
Sushi is fresh, artfully made, and service is good
If you are looking for a great sushi restaurant in the Astoria/LIC area, then keep looking
This combination sushi bar/juice bar located across the street from Mt
Sinai Hospital-Queens, is a lunch place
Meant to accomodate hungry hospital crowds, it has mediocre food, with even worse service
The staff is friendly, yet unattentive
The food is reasonably priced, but also tastes like it
Where are all the good places?
The Scene  Elias Corner traded some of that '70s outer-borough Greek-kitchen charm for a bigger dining room when it moved across 31st Street to its present digs--an interior decorator's turquoise nightmare
But the room is probably three times larger than the old one, so the wait, prohibitive on weekends in the past, is considerably shorter
The Food  The line still forms at the door, in full view of a refrigerated deli counter that serves as the evening's menu: What's in the fridge is what's for dinner
Noteworthy choices on a recent visit included red snapper, as well as the faintly sweet St
Peter's Fish--another name for tilapia--imported from Israel
Steaks, lamb chops and chicken kabobs are also served, but it's unquestionably the grilled fish that gets top billing
I was at Elias Corner in a group of 5 and was impressed by the very friendly service and good food
We ordered fish, meats and vegetables for the table and that made it really cheap! Everybody had a little bit of everything
and the dessert was on the house! I will definitely come back!
They have no menu, which is a bit unnerving
Waiter was decent, but she did seem to be in a hurry
She went through the list of fish so fast we had to ask her to repeat some items
I suggest knowing what fish you like and asking if they have it
All fish are grilled with olive oil and basic herbs
The size of the fish are impressive
I had a porgy ($16) and my friend ordered a flounder ($18)
We ordered a side of broccoli ($5) to share
Also ordered the soft shell crabs ($18) as an appetizer
They were two whole medium-size crabs served in a butter garlic sauce, delicious, had we known the price probably would not have ordered it
In all the food is good but pricey
Service is no frills
Its really just about getting you seated and fed
Very old world style
Consistantly fresh and delicious seafood with always pleasant and efficient service
My favorite place for seafood
I will never set foot in this restaurant again
The waitress and manager were so unbelievably rude that we got up and left before we even ordered
After being told (not asked) by our waitress that we (2 people) had to get up and move from our 4-person table to a small table in the corner with one inch from the next party, we asked to speak to the manager to get permission to sit at a normal table
There were, after all, no other people waiting to be sat, and there were other open tables
The manager was even worse, speaking to us like we were children being told what to do
He even had the nerve to put his hand in my face to get me to stop talking
I've never been treated with such disrespect at a restaurant
pricey, but the quality of food makes up for it
the meats and fishes are picked out daily so prices may very from day to day
authentic greek style
With no menus, any naive person will have a hard time
You can look at the fish beforehand, always good
Without menus you don't know the prices, sometimes it can be a surpise
All in all, good food though
Word to the wise - ask how much that dish is! (The place does not have menus
) Prices vary from a good value to a preposterous $16 for a charred kebab over iceberg lettuce
It must be the fresh fish that draws me back to this place after numerous unpleasant experiences, like some of the worst service you can imagine
But don't expect fancy flavor or presentation
All of the fish is prepared exactly the same way, i
e
olive oil, some herbs, SP
The green chooped salad, might be one of the best salads around and the fried calamari is also premium, however, you'd better like it plain because there's no dipping sauce
For what you get the price is about 25% too high
Though difficult to find, this restaurant offers good, fresh food at reasonable prices
Came for the first time with a big group for a birthday dinner--Citysearch says its not good for groups but it's wrong! It was great--we sat out on the back and it was like I was in another country
AMAZING food
Can't wait to go back! If you like fish--you need to try this place!
Simply excellent fish choices, all very fresh
Wonderful Greek salads with excellent vegetables -- and all at a fantastic price

The staff is very friendly and provide good service
Would recommend that everyone stop in!!!!!
This place has the best pizza
It gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice
I also recommend the garlic knots
Definitely the best pizza by the slice place! As a Native New Yorker, I haven't found a better place for what we would call New York Style Pizza
It's always the first place to go to after a travel trip
A slice of New York, a slice of home
This hole in the wall has the best pizza in town, bar none
From punks post party to prep school kids breaking curfew, everyone in the Astor Place area knows about it
None of this thin crust (read - upper crust) crap, no Chicago style pie crust
Just good old New York style pizza with quality ingrediants and a deft hand on the pizza handle
I've been coming here for over 15 years and the pizza's always perfect! Plain slices are the best! Just enough cheese, perfect sauce, and the best thin, crispy crust anyone could hope for
YUM!
If you want the best slice in New York-this is the place! Wait till they pull a fresh one out of the oven
It is a slice of heaven-but be careful not to burn the inside of your mouth
Tasty Munchies serves up some of the tastiest slices I've had in New York outside of the gourmet places
Nothing pretentious here, just a little neighborhood place where the guy cares about the quality of the food and pays attention to details -- like sesame seeds on the crust
mmm! They have other basic dishes as well as a new deli counter but when the pizza's this good, that's what I'm going to order
Maybe with a spinach roll on the side
I think the meatball parm is good
The pizza is OK
A departure from fast food pizza places like Famiglia, Domino's, or Papa Johns -- Tom's makes great, affordable pizza that is truly signature
Each pizza is made at the time of order from scratch! Like something done a little different? Tell them, they are very accommodating! I have never been disappointed with their service
Each time I order, my pizza arrives fresh and piping hot
Give them a try, you'll thank me for it!
I have dined at Mammino several times now and each time it gets bettter
I am aware of a Grand Opening Event on Sat, October 5th
I encourage all of you to come down and try it, they are offering dinner specials at 20% as well as a reduced bar and bottle service
The food is delicious and the bar has a great vibe
Definitely something to come down and check out
I used to love this place, and then not so much, and now it's great again
For a while they were having problems with
I'm not sure what, but the food wasn't fantastic, and the service a bit uneven
They've worked through all of that, though, and it's really a fantastic restaurant again
Great food, great prices, and friendly servers
A very good place for a combination group of vegetarians or vegans and omnivores, too
Though everything else falls in the mediocre range, the food is indubitably superb
I've been told by other Indonesian friends that this restaurant is as authentic as it gets
Especially in a city that seems to offer every cuisine under the sun, Indonesian food is surprisingly lacking
I thank the stars this place exists
The fare can be exotic to the Western palate but for anyone who has acquired that elusive taste for durians, something most Europeans and Americans run screaming from, the durian milkshake just can't be beat! I hope more Westerner palates are eventually convinced towards authentic Southeast Asian cuisine because once you're there, you'll never return
Maybe your friends will scoff at you for eating that big, brown porcupine of a fruit, but you will secretly know just what they're missing
More for me
borobudur is a good restaurant in manhattan, and new york
INTERESTING, DIFFERENT (BUT NOT SCARY DIFFERENT) AND TOTALLY AFFORDABLE
MOST THINGS HOVER AROUND OR BELOW $10
THE DECOR IS BARE BONES BUT IT'S A GREAT PLACE FOR A LOW KEY INEXPENSIVE DINNER WITH FRIENDS!
I have been searching for good Indonesian in Manhattan for a long time, especially after Nusamtara (sp?) closed several years ago
This cafe serves authentic, freshly prepared Indonesian food
The nasi goreng and rendang padang are tasty
I especially love Es Teler, an unusual cold drink consisting of a coconut-fruit-jelly concoction, which is not overly sweet and very refreshing
It is reminiscent of the popular Asian tapioca pearl teas (just minus the tea)
The only thing about this drink that I do not like is the large amount of ice, so in the future, I shall ask the staff to hold the cubes (or at least cut back)
Also, the caf should serve this drink with much wider straws, as all the fruits/jellies have a tendency to get stuck! Service here is friendly and quick, and prices more than reasonable
I stopped by for some brunch today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk
The food was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options
While visiting New York and working out I tasted the product at the gym
Fantastic, healthy and tasty
Peanut Butter cookies and brownies are my favorite
Since then I have been ordering to send all over the country
It is a treat eating healthy while sastifying my sweet tooth
I first tried the Protein Bakery when I saw it on the counter at my gym
The cookies and brownies are so delicious! Now I eat them after a hard workout as a reward to myself
My favorites are Cranberry Oatmeal Cookie and Peanut Butter Brownie
I recently checked out their website and found an assortment of cookies that I brought home for the holidays
They came in a beautiful tin case and colorful ribbon
My family loved it
The Protein Bakery is a real treat!!
First I have to say that the Protein Bakery does not have a commercial storefront so the comments regarding such are to be disregarded
Second, order something NoW, you won't be sorry! Better yet give a gift to someone you like, the cookies are fabulous, the peanut butter brownie is to die for and the biscotti are scrumptious! You won't be sorry and you won't feel guilty
If you're gonna eat sweets, this is the way to do it
This place is AMAZING
It's deceptive, especially b/c it's never busy, but the food is, in 3 words
off the hook
The owner and staff are so friendly, and even though they don't speak english all that well, they make EVERY effort to make your mean enjoyable
The lamb iskandar kebab is just as good, if not better than anything you can actually get in Turkey
Fresh meat, prepared to perfection, and served with freshly made bread as well
My favorite ny restaurant
This place is amazing and food is unbeliavable
I LOVED THE Turkish CHIEF BETTER !! i would suggest you to order lamb shank or Chicken sish kebab
One bad thing is ,The owner ( pakistanian )collects the tips , as all Turkish Restaurant owners do
So You dont need to tip the waiter :))
The bread is amazing
The pizza was really good
Service was very friendly and accomodating
I've been here on two different occasions where myself and another person at my table have ordered the 10 piece wings
When the food came, each of our plates only had 9
They probably assume that nobody will actually count the number of wings on their plate, let alone call them on it
I think this is the norm at this place and I hope they they change their ways
The wings are great and all, but it's not good business to consistently cheat your customers
Along with the other location at 2nd Avenue, this place probably has the best wings in the city
They also do great burgers, and they even have a few Mexican items on the menu
They'll deliver as well, and it gets there pretty fast
Wings are much larger and meater than other places, yet crispy on outside, saucy and great flavor
I like spicy wings
I ordered mine abusive and they were perfect, just enough spice so you can continue eating after a few
I got delivery and found the menu online at www

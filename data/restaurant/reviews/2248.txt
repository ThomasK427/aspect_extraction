Living in NYC, the sticker price did not shock us, but certainly if you're traveling in from out of town, there are much better places to get a true NYC ambience
The only thing recommended about this place is the sommelier, who was knowledgeable and friendly
Wow! Last night my boyfriend and I dined at 21 Club for his 21st birthday
It was definitely a night neither of us will either forget
The staff at 21 did everything and anything to make sure the night was memorable from the champagne that was waiting for us when we arrived to the candle they put in his dessert
I even had it arranged that after dinner we went downstairs to see the wine cellar which was remarkable
I highly recommended 21 Club
Obviously it was pricey but I feel that it was worth every penny
I'll definitely be going back to 21
I have to admit I was worried that 21 Club was an overrated tourist trap
But from the moment we entered the door, we were treated like an A-list guest
The service was impeccable, the food outstanding, and the atmosphere was like no other! Although we did not have theater tix, we did the prix fixe menu and it was amazing
The unique seating arrangements lent themselves to getting to know your neighbors and some fun conversations
Would definitely go again!
We had tickets to Wicked and wanted some place special and the 21 Club was it
The food was fabulous although it was very strange that they served silver spoons with the caviar
Nonetheless, the seafood was awesome as were the souffles for dessert! The waiters even reminded us of when we needed to leave to make the show! Terrific food, ambiance service - don't miss it!!!!
I've eaten at many restaurants in Manhattan, and dinner at the 21 Club was one of the best dining experiences I've had
Fantastic food, extremely friendly and prompt service, great atmosphere and one of the best wine lists in the city
Keep up the good work - I'll definitely be back
Thought the burger would be awesome, little did I know that they use Duck Fat to prepare it
The burger tastes gamey, not at all like beef
For the $25 they charge for it they should let you know ahead of time!!!
There is only one 21
It doesn't have the best food, nor the best location nor even the best decor but it has more history for more New Yorkers than anyplace else, including the Four Seasons
More major-league international business transactions have been initiated or completed here then on any golf coures or private club anywhere
The people in Washington believe they run the United States but they go to 21 to ask permission from the people who actually do
We dined at 21 Club pre theater on March 27, 2004
It as our first time there and we thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience
The cocktail lounge has great artwork, including original Remingtons
The service and ambiance were exceptional - not stuffy at all
The drinks were great
I had the 21 Burger, which at $29
00 was no bargain, but delicious
My wife's pre theater salmon, with an excellent salad and wonderful brownie dessert was terrific
We were treated very cordially by the staff and were given a tour of the impressive Prohibition-era wine cellar
I hope to return to 21 son and often
Went to an early dinner during Restaurant Week
Seated promptly
Drinks came quickly - generously poured, expensively priced ($13
50 martini!) Waiters (classic Gallic types - efficient, competent, attentive, utterly impassive) and sommolier were models of service, if perhaps too quick getting our courses out
br Food: Faultless bistrot fare; not particularly imaginative, but solid ideas well executed
(This from the limited prix fixe menu
More care seems to go into a la carte stuff - the steak tartare and caesar salad looked excellent, tho we didn't taste them
) Then they let us hang out and enjoy our buzz and the seat at what was evidently Bogart's old table
With cocktails, $50 wine, and a couple extra sides, four of us got out for $375 w/tip
Would I go again? On a prix fixe, yes, tho not drinking as much
I'd rather have spent $100 less
On an expense account? Definitely
I eat out about 3 times per week in NYC, and I know a great restaurant when I see one
I went to 21 for the first time on a recommendation from a co-worker, and now I'm a customer for life
After hearing all of the rumors about this place being an old men's club, obviously the people who told me this haven't been there lately
Although it was our first time at 21, we were treated as regulars from the time we walked in from the sidewalk, until we walked out to our cab
The food, the service, the impressive wine list, and of course the fun atmosphere(that most restaurants of this caliber lack) were incredible
My friends from out of town are all fans for life too!
I've been to a number of steak houses in the city, peter lugers, sparks, ruth chris, but when I tasted the absolutely most mouth watering steak in NYC, I couldn't get enough
My wife and I highly recommend 21 Club if you want incredible service w/ absolutely the highest quality of food in the city
The atmosphere along w/ the unbelievable service made it a memorable evening and I can't wait to go back
Managers Bryan McGuire and Bruce Snyder went above and beyond anything expected to help arrange a spectacular evening for my fiance and I
I have been to most top restaurants in Manhattan and I can honestly say that I have never experienced such a willingness to help a customer on the part of the staff
Besides the great service, the restaurant's rich history creates a warm and interesting atmosphere (especially in the wine cellar)
As if this wasnt enough, the food was top notch and the wine list, as expected, was superb
Thank you to everyone at 21 for helping create a perfect evening
I went to 21 with some Marines in town for Fleet Week and I was overwhelmed by the courtesy and respect shown to them by the clientele and staff of 21
Patron after patron praised their heroism and offered to buy them cocktails
The staff treated them like true royalty
Thank you to everyone at 21 for making this a truly special occassion for the men and women who do so much for us all
This establishment is full of history and stories, but none more impressive than the wine cellar
21 Club, a speakeasy, in it's time was full of character and cheer
The food was good and the service was outstanding
Expect to pay for this experience and bring your tie because the little guy in the front will not let you pass w/o one
DECEMBER 6, 2002 - LUNCH WITH MY DAUGHTER
BEING FROM THE MIDWEST, I HAD REQUESTED INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESTAURANT
SPOKE WITH JUDY, WHO WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND ACCOMMODATING
PHONED IN NOVEMBER TO REMIND ME TO MAKE RESERVATIONS
THE MANAGER WAS GRRRRRREAT!! HE BROUGHT US TO OUR SEATING AGAINST THE WALL
I COULDN'T STOP GRINNING!! I WAS DISAPPOINTED A PRICE-FIXE MENU WASN'T OFFERED; MY DAUGHTER REQUESTED ONE AND WE ORDERED FROM SAID MENU
I HAD THE CHICKEN PILLIARD AND MY DAUGHTER ORDERED THE SHRIMP PASTA
THE SERVICE WAS IMPECCABLE
OUR DESSERT, LEMON CAKE, WAS ROLLED IN A BALL AND TASTED LIKE HEAVEN
WITH TIP, OUR BILL CAME TO $120, HOWEVER, I WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
UPON LEAVING, THE MANAGER (BEEN THERE FOR 35 (?) YEARS WALKED US TO THE STREET AND DIRECTED US TO ROCKEFELLER CENTER
HE WAS FABULOUS
21 is all its cracked up to be
With incredible service, great food, and the most unique atmosphere in New York, this place is one of the best around
I had the classic 21 burger, which was worth every cent
If you want a special night in the city
try the bar room at 21
went here for drinks lastnight with my boyfriend
checked our coats, waited to receive ticket
the girl didn't make eyecontact so we moved on
afterwards went to coatcheck there was now an older (horrible) woman
explained we did not receive a ticket but have a whitecoat and plaidcoat, very distinctive
were curtly told,EVERYbody gets a ticket! well we didn't get a ticket but you'll find them
she told us to stepaside for men behind us
i again asked could we please haveour coats, nothing
a host cameover
informed him we did not receive a ticket but would like our coats
he responded EVERYbody gets a ticket! shocked, i asked his name
his response? what's YOUR name? during this insane conversation the coat hag threw our coats at us

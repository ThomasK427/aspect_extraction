Ate here for Valentine's Day and it was ridculously crowded - I don't know how they managed to fit in so many tables, and they clearly overbooked
However, the waitstaff was quite attentive, the bartender was helpful and pleasant despite being harried and overworked, and the food was excellent
In Short Take a quick trip to Maine at this classic lobster pound where the outdoor picnic tables are the prime seats in summertime
Diners can choose from chowders, sandwiches and fried or broiled platters featuring the swimmers of their fancy
But lobster is the best catch here, served one to three pounds, steamed or broiled
Film buffs will recognize the spot as the inspiration for the indie film "Brooklyn Lobster," which chronicles the real life financial struggle of the Jordan family
This place is Brooklyns version of a Maine lobster pound
While it can get pricey, 25$ for a lobster 3sides and a refillable drink, its tons of fun, and the food tastes great! Definitely a must!!
The prices for what you get are very reasonable
It's hard to get to if you don't have a car though
Jordans is one of the best quick cheap seafood places in the city
Great fresh seafood right from the market next store
Fried clams are one of my favorites along with the lobsters and soups
The shrimp and lobster bisques are very good, but serverd in styrofoam cups which will affect the taste if not eaten quickly
Stay away from the corn in the platters
Always overcooked and tasteless
Cashiers can be a little more attentive and the TV reception stinks - as does the choice of shows
I completely disagree with the previous reviewer
Kar is a fine establishment with the best Beef Chow Fun this side of the Pacific
The texture of their flat noodles is something that has to be experienced to understand
The service is great, my soup always arrives nice and hot
My only complaint might be the fortune cookies - I've never had a cookie predict bad luck for me before I visited Kar
Kar used to be the innovator of unique chinese food
not the usual fare
It is now nothing but an overpriced establishment that is shamelessly riding on the coat tails of its past
The beef fried rice made my daughter think of every joke that mentions felines and chinese food in the same sentence
Even I questioned the contents
Also, my shrimp dish was not edible - the waiter and management ignored my complaints
I won't be riding in that KAR anymore, thats for sure
In Short Famous for its deep-dish Sicilian pies, Lpizza counter, spumoni stand, and indoor restaurant
Picnic tables, crawling with neighborhood families, ring the exterior of the slightly more formal sit-down restaurant serving hero sandwiches, pastas, seafood dishes and traditional Italian entrees
As for the main attraction, the pies are known for their crisp outer edge and gooey middle, and feature the unorthodox layering of sauce over mozzarella
The best of all Sicilian squares you will ever tast
Cruncy crust, fresh cheese, homemade all the way
I have gone to Spumoni Gardens since the mid 1980's so I know their place well
Year after year they have had the best square (sicilian) pizza and the fastest service of all the places I've been
I grew up in Brooklyn and went to Spumoni Gardens nearly every Saturday night before going out for several years
After that I went to Spumoni Gardens every time I was in the neighborhood, whether I was hungry or not because I am always in the mood for the best pizza in all of NYC! The sauce on the pizza is amazing, like nothing else and they are generous with it! Make sure you get plenty of napkins because you'll need them! They always use the perfect amount of cheeze and it's obviouse they use high quality products to make their pizza
Make sure you get at least 2 slices because one will never be enough of that great combination of ingredients! Before you leave get an ice too! They are just as great as the pizza! It's no wonder Spumponi Gardens has been around for so many years!
No better square pizza anywhere
The spamoni is even better than the pizza
Been going there for 45 years and now I take my family
Best place to eat a slice outside while watching Brooklyn life go by
The wise guy wanna be-s are still there eating a slice right next to the cops and firefighters who always seem to be double parked in front
The Brooklyn hotties who go there are just as hot as when I was a kid and the pizza is just as good
I enjoy L B's pizza
The round pizza is just OK but the square is excellent
Cheese on the bottom, sauce on top - not too thick or doughy
You eat the pizza outside on a warm summer evening
You can even bring your dog! The food in the restaurant is usually quite good
although the ambiance is just so-so (think plastic table cloths)
There is one important thing to know about this place
It has the best sicilian pizza in new york city, and therefore in the world
Anyone who disagrees clearly does not know what good pizza is
I live a few blocks away from LB, and there are always a bunch of people, especially teenagers hanging around
Finally, my husband and I decided that we have to go eat there
What a disappointment! The pizza was soggy and flavorless, and the pasta sauce tasted worse than the jarred ones
To add insult to injury, the service was not nasty, just very cold
Sort of like they're doing you a favor that they're allowing you to eat there
There are several really good Italian pizza places close by
Skip LB and head over to one of the others
Took our upstate college softball team here for eats last spring after playing at St
Francis
Nothing in our area to compare it to
The sicilian slices and spumoni were the best I've had in 50 years of eating
Also loved the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood
I've been back twice since spring and plan on making a point of visiting whenever I'm in the city
Been going there for a while
Pizza is one of the best around
When friends from abroad come for the real authentic italian american pizza, I take them here
Only suggestion is that they have a better way to order and pick up
Can get very busy in the summer and warmer months with long lines
Come with a empty stomach cause you will fill it!
my dad grew up right across the street and raved about the spumoni and silician slices here my entire life
finally i'm 23 and he took me, and even after all his hype (he's a major foodie and has impeccable taste) it exceeded my expectations
no other silician slice compares, nothing else even deserves to be called silician in contrast - delicious sauce, light and airy bread, perfect crust
man oh man
and the pistachio spumoni is incredibly good, as far as i'm concerned this is the only place worth even trying spumoni
everywhere else is just ice cream with stuff in it
This is by far the best pizza that you have ever eaten
You can go to all these gormet places and eat expensive pizza this is the best cheese, sauce, bread its a done deal
If you like Brick Oven go to Grimaldi's but you want pizza go hear and have a spumoni that is the best period! Unless you are going to Italy you can not compete
Also the food is enormous so do not order too much unless you want leftovers for a week! Also, all these other pizza places do they have a fire truck, police cars and ambulance double and triple parked? That right there you should go do not walk RUN!!! Its great! Brooklyn's best kept secret!
I went with a friend from Brooklyn
Until then I thought I'd had the best pizza NYC had to offer - John's, Arturo's, Lombardi's, et al
All good
But when I bit into the Sicilian slice at L B I saw God
Crisp crust, delicious sauce, the right amount of cheese
Don't get me wrong the Neopolitan slice was also very, very good
But nothing tops the square slice! I only had two slices because I wanted room for the spumoni
It's rare to find homemade spumoni
Most people settle for the tri-flavored ice cream in the supermarket
The other food they serve is also very good, but the pizza keeps calling me back!
Grew up near LB as a kid
Been going there for 55+ years
The round pizza doesn't taste as good as I recall, it's still wonderful, but the Sicilian is to die for
You have to try their home made spumoni; unbelieveable
i live in Arizona go back to Bklyn 3x's a year
LB is always a must to stop at
There's double pkg on the street if the small lot is full

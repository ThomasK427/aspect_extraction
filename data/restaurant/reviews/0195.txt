My friends and I ordered off the prix-fixe menu for Restaurant Week, ($35
00 for an appetizer, entree, and desert), and the food was quite good
The Prosecco we tried to order was out of stock, and the Cotes du Rhone we settled on afterwords was far too warm to drink, (though the server offered to chill it for us)
The food was simple, but very tasty, but the restaurant lacks the intimate atmosphere deserving of the fine food created in the kitchen
I therefore cannot say the dining experience was ultimately a good one
The shorftalls of the restaurant were too obvious
We went to Artisanal on the advice of a wine and food writer and could not have been happier! The service was fantastic and the food even better
We had a cheese plate and ordered the fondue of the day--fontina with white truffel oil
It was heavenly! The wine list was extensive and our waiter did a fine job of helping us choose the perfect wine for our meal
All in all this was a fantastic cheese adventure! The only possible downside is that it is noisy--not a good choice for intimate dining
We enjoyed the energy of the restaurant, though, and will certainly return on our next visit to NYC
My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious, new summer menu at Artisanal last night
We ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn't a problem to get our table immediately
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese
(This was nice b/c both the wine list and the cheese menu are very large
) The summer feta/watermelon salad and the shrimp/avocado dishes were excellent (and refreshing after the cheese course)! If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!
It is an absolute joke to insinuate this place offers high customer service
I went with a group of 9 ladies and it took 55 minutes - I am not exagerrating - to get a glass of wine
55 minutes! The couple behind us had their bread, drinks, and dinner before we even got our wine
I guess the fact an automatic 18% would be added to the bill for our larger party allowed our server to feel entitled to being utterly rude and worthless - who, by the way, rolled her eyes on the way to our table, ignored polite requests for the check 3 times, took nearly an hour and a half for BREAD, etc
Food was great and the manager was a sweetheart
However, being on the pricier end you expect decent service or at least common courtesy
What a waste of what should have been a fun night in the city with friends
Stay away, especially if you are in your early 20's and don't want to be treated like homeless beggers
I went here with 3 friends for brunch and had a great meal
We made reservations for 12pm and were seated immediately
The waiter was very knowledgeable and steered us towards great selections
The food (mostly non-cheese related) was fantastic
The non-alcoholic cocktails tasted like a dream as well
I have never been here for dinner but I can say that the brunch is definitely top notch
I understand that this place used to be very posh and have a famous chef, but it's clearly only resting on its laurels now
Food was way too mediocre to be that pricey, and the service was very cursory
And the wine list is WAY too expensive
the cheapest bottle is over $50! Are they trying to prove their worth by charging too much for wine?
We were there yesterday to celebrate Easter with a group of friends
My girlfriend spent a lot of time searching for a nice place, faxing back and forth her credit card info in order to reserve a spot at a place that turned out to be flat bad
The cheese selection is very good, but for the portions sizes better ask for chopsticks
They have a decent wine list
The service was very poor, impertinent, and aggressive
I do not know why but they didn't even know how to pronounce some cheeses and could not elaborate on them
You will be better going to Fairway, Zabar's or Stew Leonard to get your cheese
At the end we paid almost $400 (55pp) and because we made a calculation error, they came back and asked for the remaining $1
18! ?
SUPERB!!!! The food, the wine, the service
everything was wonderful and believe me , pleasing a group of 12 is not easy
Each and every one of us is raving about what is our favorite restaurant out of the 6 we visited during the Easter holiday
The host was more than accomodating as I did not have reservations
I was told we would have a table in about 2 hours, so we went to enjoy the city
Upon returning, the host knew me by name and sat us within 15 minutes
We had gone specifically for the cheese fondue, so we ordered that with a fine Pinot Grigio
We followed the meal with a nice Port
The atmosphere was a little less than inviting as the tables are close together and I could hear the brother/sister couple next to us arguing (although this did provide entertainment for the evening)
The waiter was able to answer any questions I had about the wine or food
Yes, the prices are very steep and I wouldn't go as far as to say the overall experience was worth the high prices, but they do have great food and wine
Went here for lunch
Fantastic fondue and great wine
Crepes were delicious, too
Big, bright and airy
Perfect for lunch/brunch
I went in for an afternoon cheese plate (and some wine) with my girlfriend and we sat at the bar
Both of us work in the industry and are familiar with many of the wines and cheeses, so we were excited to be there, but our service was astonishingly bad
They even brought us the wrong cheese and made no apologies or offers to change it
The wines by the glass were marked up to the extreme, although the list was huge
Some of them you can find for less at better restaurants
Overall it was a dissapointing experience
I'd rather go for cheese at a less stuffy place, where, ironically, the service will be better
We went there for restaurant week and decided on family style to make it interesting
We tried the tuna carpaccio which was very good
The cheese fondue was delicious
We tried the cheese from the next table and the Artisanal Blend is definitely the best cheese for fondue
Fun, but $24 is quite a bit for bread and melted cheese
The beef burgundy was ok, not fantastic
I liked the Chocolate Pavlova
Wifey didn't
Decor is the obvious french red and beige and it's a BIG room which makes it noisy
Table proximity helps you meet neighbors if you're into that
We are
We might be back, but I'm not running
I just had to write to defend Artisanal
I went there last night with some friends, and we had a wonderful time
The place definitely has a brasserie meets cafeteria vibe, but it was fun for the four of us
The fondue is amazing--the petite had enough for three of us to eat our fill
Everyone loved their dishes (admittedly, not on the RW menu), and we all especially loved the desserts
The cheesecake is wonderful--not cardboard like at all! The service was hurried, but polite
I think this is a great place to meet up with old friends and enjoy some nice French food
While I could live with being seated next to the service bar (as a plate was dropped on the floor) and menus being tossed onto the table, conversation was difficult because the overall noise level is so high
Our dinner order was taken in a somewhat preemptory manner, salads were basically dropped in front of us, and the fondue, which the menu said would serve 1-3 people, had barely enough cheese for one, so we had to order a second (it seems we weren't the first to complain about the lack of cheese, as the waiter was prepared to responded to the request for more cheese with a repeated would you like to order another fondue)
Wines are only on the high-end, priced 3-4 times more retail with no good moderately priced wines (a decent Mersault was $125)
We skipped coffee and desert to leave for quieter, more comfortable environs
I was expecting to like this place, but I really didn't
The service was good-very good-promptly seated, served quickly, and checked in with just the right amount
However, the restaurant smacked more of a cafeteria than a restaurant-zilcho ambience
If I ever returned, it would be for lunch only, and definitely not for a date
Also, it wasn't fun; it lacked feeling and distinctiveness
Finally, I think the restaurant did itself a disservice by participating n restaurant week-the food was insipid; there was almost no opportunity to taste the cheeses; and the 'chocolate pavlova' dessert was inedible
ok, we went for restaurant week so the choices were limited
but need the choices also be LAME? since none of the choices included the cache bling of the place, the cheese, we decided that along with the restaurant choices we'd order asie from the menu and try the fondue
good idea cause honestly it was fantastic
but then thats it
the soup and salad, eh

It looks like it used to be a church with it's high ceilings
The food was unbelievable
Each dish was better than the next
On my way out, I booked my next reservation
Through a recommendation of a friend, we recently went to Providence for dinner
The place is breathtaking
Not until seeing the rafters did I realize this was the same place that I used to go to when I was younger
Le Bar Bat
What a big transformation! The food in itself was something to rave about
The homemade pasta (i'm speechless!)
It's my new found favorite restaurant! I can't wait to go back
fabulous! super! terrific! are only a few words to describe this place
first of all we are all floored with the way this space looks
it's beautiful
the food is matches the decor
we had a shaved artichoke salad and jumbo shrimp cocktail martini and then had baby rack of lamb and little candy shape mushroom pasta
yum yum! the dessert should be wrapped up to have with your loved one in bed
its that heavenly
The food was wonderful
The mojitos were the best I ever had and the staff was friendly and courteous
I love the food here
It's super fresh, they make fab mojitos and the price is reasonable
Good food, ambiance, and some of the best Mojitos I have had thus far all  for reasonable pricing
I have passed the place a couple times and decided to stop in Saturday night
I was pleasantly surprised
Small place dimly lit
Light but decent menu
Stiff drinks minus the heavy prix tag
Cool spot with out really trying to be cool
The Steak and Onions with rice and beans was damn good!! Mojitos will definitely become one of my regular Ft Green Spots
My husband, his cousin and I went for Sunday brunch - the thing myhusband loved, was the $8 unlimited mimosas! (other drinks were also available)
However, there was literally ONE waitress serving the entire place, and often she forgot our refills
The best out of the three entree's we had was the goat cheese ravioli
The nutella panino should have been listed on the desert menu, and served with a salad, had lime sauce all over it
We'll go back one of the weekends for brunch and that ravioli
After reading reviews and checking a lot of websites I chose Sette for a special event dinner
When arriving I fell in love with the setting the restaurant has but was quickly turned of by the service or lack there of
We were quickly sated
The waitress took about 10 minutes to make the first trip to our table
At that time we ordered, drinks, appetizers and dinner
The appetizers took 25 minutes to be brought out by then we had finished our first round of cokes and I had to flag down a bus boy to get refills since our waitress did not even look our direction, when she came she just snatched the cups and did not even bother asking how was everything going! After our 25 minute wait for appetizers we waited another 40 minutes for dinner
By that time I was not hungry any more and was tempted to just get up and leave but did not want to ruin the mood
While waiting for dinner we noticed that the table next to us also had to ask were their food was! Finally after over an hour we were brought out our dinner which looked liked something that was just thrown together in a rush, I had lasagna which was a childs portion and my boyfriend had pollo paillard which was grilled chicken topped with salad and dressing
My bill was almost $52 for poor service and food that I could have gotten at the Olive Garden for half of the price
Recently went for brunch and had the worst service I've ever experienced in NY
Our waiter was apparently angry to have to be serving, because it took him 15 minutes to even bring water, let alone take a drink order (it was early on in the day and the restaurant was not even 50% full, so he was NOT busy)
The food was good, although the order was not correct, so had to wait another 10 minutes for 2 of the plates
Overall, would recommend the food, but will NOT go back due to the lack of service
The busers were very friendly and helpful
It was the bartender/waiter (all in one) who was rude and nasty
I went here for Valentine's Day and I ended up making a great impression on my date
We sat in the back room which was very intimate
The normal menu was available as well as a prixe fixe, unlike many other places on V-Day
The wait staff was very attentive and the skirt steak was delicious
Ate various times at Sette
I typically order the special and am always pleasantly surprised
Their wine list is good and prices are within reason
Knowledgeable and friendly staff make this restaurant a great place to have dinner!
I can't say enough about this place
The food was great, the staff great, the ambience great
great, great, great!! I had a large party of 12 and everyone loved it
You can't beat the prices and the place decor is very modern and clean
from the abrasive hostess to the neglectful waitress, this place was a DISASTER
not only are there far better places for italian food, but if you expect a minimal standard of service, this is NOT the place for you
NOT RECOMMENDED
Relaxing ambiance, unique italian menu, friendly service, great drinks and wine selection--love the outdoor seating
great for brunch as well
can't wait to go back
The staff was great the food was better , I felt like I was in ITALY, I am going to become a regular customer!
Every time I have walked into this place (and friends have confirmed the experience) I feel like the girl behind the counter (no matter which one it is) wonders why the hell someone would dare bother her
Umm, do you actually WANT business? The cookies and brownies are pretty good, and this is a block from where I live, but I won't go there anymore
Who needs that attitude??? They're COOKIES
Seriously
The cookies were sweet and delicious, and the service was sweet too
The guy at the counter warmed up my cookie for me and didn't seem to mind when I asked him for both milk and cream in my coffee
I'll definitely go back
I needed a break from my homework and my friend suggested this place
It was so much fun
They have so many great options
I went with 3 peanut butter chocolate chip cookies and green tea
I will definitely go back
We visited this cute shop when we were in New York for a vacation
Absolutely adorable
We picked up a gift tin to bring back to my mom
I highly recommend this place and wish there were one in LA
These are simply the best cookies I ever had
The peanut butter cookie was so rich and decadent it should be rated NC-17
Also try the oatmeal raisin and chocolate mint
This place is well worth the trip I made from uptown
The cookies were delicious
Also try the egg nog latte for the Holidays
We had a great time making our own cookies at a Design Your Own party
It's a great idea and the girls had a fabulous time
The cookies were delicious
I will never go here again! My girlfriends and I were having a MC craving and was I disappointed
The service was terrible
they were so unhelpful and made us feel unwanted
Such an awkward experience
Were we inappropriate to just want some cookies and milk on a saturday afternoon? Food really not all that great either
Go to your local bakery instead! At least they'll greet you with a smile

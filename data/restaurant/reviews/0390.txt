Met friends there after work last week; worth going out of the way for
Suba does it just like they do in Spain - free tapas with your beer or cocktail; I didn't know that when I got there, but needless to say, that made the experiece that much better
Great food, great scene, I'll be back often
I never write reviews, but this place definitely was worth the effort
I took my husband there for his birthday
This place has it all: romantic, young and trendy atmosphere (grotto room), friendly hostess and waitress, proper serving, eclecticly mixed delicious food
all you could want for a special evening
We've left the place with a big smile on our faces :) Plus, check out their website
it definitely represents what this place stands for
totally right branding
had a later dinner there on a friday nite
place has to be seen
very unique
Food was tasty and creatively displayed
Great atmosphere as well
Only negative was that the entrees came immediately after the apps

felt kinda rushed, but no biggie
Overall the service was very attentive
great place
I was there for a friend's birthday party last week, and had a great, great time
I thought the menu was extremely creative, and very well executed; the service was tremendous (I have a lot of dietary quirks, and they were very accomodating to some special requests I had to make)
After dinner, we got into the skylight room, where the DJ was spinning some really cool Brazilian music
We stayed until well past 2 AM, and had one of the best nights I've had in a while
Wow! My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary! It was very romantic
The water-room was beautiful
My ceviche was incredible, and our desserts were amazing
My mojito, by the way, was the best I've had in NYC
Great dinner last Saturday
Bar upstairs was packed (in a good way) with a lot of very attractive people
Got downstairs, sat in the skylight room (the one without the water), and loved it
you never hear anyone talk about it, but it's also a great room
Food was really interesting - the duck was one of the best dishes I've had in Manhattan - and the wine list was very extensive
Music was very cool, too
not to sound obnoxious, but my date was very, very impressed
Someone should have told these guys that you can't build a successful restaurant on decor along (or can you)
It is almost as if the food is an overseasoned, small-portion of an aftethought
Service was terrible
With a half-full dining room, it took 30 minutes to get a drink
My dinner came out cold and undercooked
Then when they brought it back it was warm but still undercooked
The decor is fabulous, but they desperately need to improve the food
Suba is a truly wonderful experience
The latin ambience is hip, modern and warm
The new menu has a wonderful array of choice with some spectacular fish entrees
I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great dinner in a very cool setting
My wife and I always loved meigas, and were very sad when it closed; imagine our surprise when we found out that Louis Bollo (from Meigas) is the new chef at Suba! We enjoyed a $29 prix fix meal in the grotto (the room with the water - VERY romantic), which is available during the week (before 8:00?)
My Carne a la Plancha was excellent, and my wife, a vegetarian, loved her eggplant canneloni
Heard Luis Bollo was back in town and cooking at Suba
What an improvement! The food is just great
Spanish, but not heavy
Full of flavor (meal at Town this week was twice as expensive and wasn't half as good)
Thanks, I'll be back
Suba was a great place with a innovative motif that creates a unique dining experience
The food combinations are refreshing and tasteful while the service was excellent
Combine that with the price and you have a must visit
Great for groups and yet intimate enough for two
Walking around the LES this past Sunday, I was surprised to find Suba open (I'd heard they didn't serve on Sundays)
Went inside, had dinner with a friend
in a word, fantastic
With a more mellow scene than what you'd find on the weekend, the focus was strictly on the food
The duck (a newer dish) was unreal, the wine list extensive, and the service attentive
I'll be back
we were a big group, but had reservations for a late dinner and when we got there - there was practically no good food left on the menu
it was a nightmare, the food sucked
the ambience and the nightclub made up for it
will we be back? at an earlier time in the evening possibly
Great venue for sexy redheads looking to wind down after a summer of being vastly overserved
Former basketball players and struggling writers welcome
Noise violation laws strictly enforced
Especially outstanding for official first dates after multiple drunken hookups at beach bars
So come down to the place where the drinks are cold and the scene is sizzling
What a waste of one of the most beautiful rooms in NYC! The water room is unique, amazing, romantic and the epitome of NY swank
The food is terrible, and the portions are microscopic
My shrimp ceviche consisted of shrimp pieces suspended in a ketchup- like substance!!! Even more ridiculous, you can't order tapas in the dining room
Suba should fire the chef, change their water room into a lounge/ drink area and consider letting guests order in from the pizza place down the street
Overall decor is amazing
The grotto room is a must with a moat circling the entire room
It is obviously an architects restaurant
Food is good but portions are lacking
The service is horrible
The hostesses and wait staff could use some training in manners
The wait is usually upwards of an hour regardless of reservations
They truly make the client feel unwelcome
The attitudes also run very high
My take is that they charge top prices for sub-par performance
Came to Suba expecting a scene, left impressed by the food
Gazpacho (yellow!), ceviches, and entree (pollo) were far beyond expectations
Better than Mercer Kitchen in my opinion
Only weak point were the desserts
Will definitely be back
Oh, and the water room is probably the sexiest dining room you will ever see
I've read mixed reviews about Suba
After going there for a friend's birthday, I was extremely impressed
The menu was both imaginative and well executed; highlights included arctic char ceviche, which was sublime, and the Herb Roasted Chicken , which was very flavorful
The drink menu was just as creative, the dining room sexy as hell, and the service very professional
I will be going back soon
The Lowdown: The food, although very well presented, (yellow tomato gezpacho=nice) lacked obvious things such as sauces for the main dishes
Service: despicable
Truly

everyone should pull up a chair
The whole town smells like fresh fish
It is a throwback to the old fishing community
Stepping into Sheepshead Bay is like stepping back in time
Lundy Brothers was closed for 17 years, but the new owners have worked hard to preserve it's original integrity
The fish is fresh as it can be, the clams and oysters are sweet and firm
You can pick your own lobster while it is still swimming
It is truly worth the trip! Service has improved drastically from the old days, you are now seated by a hostess instead of standing behind a nearby table waiting for them to finish
Castle Harbor is a great place in Shepshead Bay
A little off the beaten track - further down Emmons Ave
The Food is always consistently good
Large portions, well prepared and nicely presented
Good selections on the menu
Very resonably priced and downright cheap with the specials
The restaurant is an interesting mix of a saliors dream and a hunters conquest
Lots of stuffed mounted animals including a complete lion
This is not a place for PETA, but if you agree with hunting, it is a great place for the kids
Private parties are good here and the staff was very accomidating to special requests
Negatives? Service can be slow
At a party, the wait staff forgot to bring coffee at dessert and had to be proded into it
The valet parking does park your car on the sidewalk, but I haven't had any problems
One night when Lundy's air conditioning failed, we gave this one a try
We were seated promptly, and after an inordinate wait, somebody took our drink order and disappeared for half an hour
This set the tone for theevening
The seafood is good for the price, the decor is an unfortunate mix of dark timbered walls as if you're in a ship, with a stuffed lion, antelope heads crocodiles on the walls like Bwana Hemingway was about to arrive
The service stinks, it's atrocious, terrible
The hostess explained that the problem was it was busy, but the place was almost half empty
My wife responded to our waiter's inattention by giving him a tip around 12 percent
He had the gall to insist he was entitled to twice the tax
As we left we realized the valets had parked several cars illegally and those lucky customers were receiving summonses
bad experience:  1) unorganized staff 2) light business this day JUly 5,40 minutes for order to come 3) minimal portio 4) food was lousy 5) couldnt wait to finish 6) 10% service charge and waitress indicated that an additional tip is suggested ????  first and last time
This place just like caviar is an accquired taste or in this case I guess attitude
Its not a restauarnt that was created and made to service non russian patrons I think but taht doesnt mean you can enjoy it
When it coes to russina style dinig and entertainment you do need to know hat to expect its ethnicaly very differnt from what most non russians are used to
Going to Rasputin is afull experience from eating, drinking, dancing, and show wise
you go all out with dress, tastes, and performance, and in the end its really about having a good time where you truly indulge yoursef in good vodka, compnay, music, and food
95% of patrons are Russian
As such, if you are not Russian, you will feel like bit of outsider
Appears most staff speak limited English
My sense is Russians not known for niceties or service
That said, it's a sorta odd place to just sit back and observe the show , which includes the other patrons
Food is endless
Bottles of vodka all over everyone's tables
Patrons get quite dressed-up, almost like what most folks would wear to a wedding party
Floor show is sorta over-the-top, two-decades-out-of-step tacky Eastern European style
Food quality was good, but yes, pricey, but you need to remember it includes free show
This is something to experience, but don't expect white-glove service
If you go with an open mind, you should really get a kick out of this place
Nice place to go to if you appreciate a french/euro/russian cuisine
Very nice service and atmosphere
Great place to celebrate b-day parties!
I was at Rasputin selebrating a frind's birthday a few month agoand I loved it! See, you have to know a little about what to expect before heading there, because Russian style of entertainment is very different
We loved it!!! The food incredible and plenty of it
Vodka by the bottle (I love that - because ordering shout can cost much more) The show was incredible - we actually did not expect to see such a well put, professional Vegas type show at all and to out surprise it was very well done
I also do not think waiters there are rude- yes there are not friendly and chatty, but do provide great service
My 30th Birthday is coming up - and guess where I am celebrating!!!
This restaurant has become a golden standard at least for all its patrons who know and love Russian food and entertainment
Its very busy and buzzing with life every time we have been there
Great for special occasions or just a night out
Last time got to try a prefix banquet called Royal It was excellent
Classic Lardon salad, Blini with caviar and Rack of Lamb were my favorite
Defiantly more food then you can possibly eat
A brand new show (changed every 6-8 moth) rivals the best Broadway/Las Vegas production
Its pricy but well worth it
I would recommend it to anyone who want to experience something unusual and exiting
Went there recently on a tip from my Russian coworker
He told me that this was the best Russian restaurant outside of Russia
Very unique place
It combines good food (I had Russian Rolls and Sea Bass, both were excellent) with Vegas style show, live music and dancing till dawn
Service was curtsies and attentive
Great place for those who like to experience something new
Defiantly recommend trying at least once if not more
This is not your traditional 5 star
This is a very ethnic restaurant and its service targeted towards the people who can appreciate eclectic cusine, good Euro and Russian music
Service is fantastic
Been there a number of times, waiters speak several languages, polite and will good manners
(unless you provoke them, bouncers can be a bit scary
I look at it as part of the flavor, after all its Brooklyn)
just horrible!!  1
were seated in the very far corner ( other tables were available and we reserved)-  2
so almost didn't see the show
3
overpriced menu
4
chiken tabaka was disguisting
5
asked for diet coke - got a plastic bottle with no glass or ice!  6
15 min
to get the waitor to come to take the order
7
When ordered tea, got a teapot first and after 10-15 min
- spoones and cups
8
Never got Splenda (asked 2 times before show, 1 time after)
9
had to wait for check for 20 min after request!  10
The attitude was unappropriate ( In russian, as in French, there is a common form tu - and Vous- polite one
I speak the language, so waitor adressed to me using tu, and I don't care that he was my father's age, that's not an excuse
) Over all very disappointing
we never come back!

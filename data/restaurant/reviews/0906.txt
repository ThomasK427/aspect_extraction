If you like Greek food, you have to come to Pylos
Located in the heart of East Village right by Thompson Square Park, Pylos is in good company with resteraunts all around them
The food here is superb
Amazing flavors and great Greek home cooked feel
The lamb is as tender and flavorful as it gets and the appetizers are all delicious! The service can be slow as it gets busy sometimes, and you must get a reservation to be seated promptly
This place is usually booked
for dinner
The food and value is definately worth it
Large serving sizes for entrees and a very well decorated resteraunt
Love it!
My problems are# 1) I recommened Pylos to my friends and on THREE occasions when my friends had dinner parties there (parties with 6 people) when they ordered dessert they were told they had to hurry up and finish quickly
HOW DARE THEY!!! #2) I tried to organize a dinner party there for 8:00 one day and was told they already had a big party set but they could seat me at 8:30, which is fine BUT two days later and 2 hours before my researvation they called me to cancel the reservations because they couldn't fit us in
HOW DARE THEY!! #3) They also charge $25 min per person (not including alcohol) for groups over 6
WHO DOES THIS?? In conclusion, I would NOT have a group dinner there
I'm very surprised to read the negativ reviews - my dinner at Pylos the other night was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had in awhile
The food was different from your typical Greek food
In fact, the appetizers looked so good that we made a meal of appetizers and a salad! They were all delicous, the stand outs being the grilled octopus which was perfect, and the phyllo triangles, each one stuffed with something else! The decor was lovely, and the wait staff was gracious and unobtrusive
The bill was not bad as well
We'll be back
Living in the EV is wonderful for so many reasons, and the restaurants is the #1 reason
Pylos is no exception--it has full, robust flavored food for everyone--seafood, meat, veg lovers
The appetizers are the best, especially the perfectly cooked/meaty octopus, and the Greek wine selection is great and cheap too! I've been here tons of times and will continue as long as they provide the same standards of greatness
The night didn't start off well since we waited 15 minutes even though we had made a reservation and I saw a couple tables open
After getting a drink at the bar we were seated and did nothing but indulge after
Things I tasted and were wonderful: artichoke moussaka, sauteed eggplant, grilled fish, stuffed phylo, lamb chops
Only the desserts were ordinary, but the whole night was great
Also, the waitress was really helpful, recommending wine from the all-Greek list and favorite dishes
If the upcoming Olympics had an event for Greek restaurants, Pylos would win a gold medal in every event
The menu is wonderfully diverse
The decor is warm and friendly, just like the wait staff
And the food, sublime
They have a new spring menu with two dishes that have become my favorites: an appetizer, artichoke mousaka ($8); and an main of chicken sauteed in tomato and olives($14)
Both are wonderful
My favorite dessert is the Greek Napolean($6), a light combination of youghert and sour cherries in crispy phylo dough
My recommendation is that you sprint, after you call for reservations
Its busy, full most nights after 7:30PM
Our experience was positively wonderful
The hostess couldn't have been nicer
We were seated right away
We found the ambiance warm and comforting
Ceiling of pots provided unbelieveable sound absorbtion
Food was as good as we have had in Greece
So sorry we could not eat more!
Nice decor and an extensive menu lured me in, but the horrible service and rude staff drove me out
First the good: food, decor, wine, etc a great place
The flipside: service I don't know what's going on there the host lied to my face about a table being ready in 10 minutes for my party of 3
I had to wait at the wine bar for over 45 minutes and 3 complaints before getting a 2 person table for 3 while alleged reserved tables stayed open
Nice decor
Great food
Waitstaff great
However
Hostess unaccommodating and had attitude
We tried Pylos a week before, but she could not seat us, as the empty tables had been reserved
I called the next day, and was told they don't take reservations for couples
Frustrating, but tried again
This time, we were told we would have to finish by 8:15, since they had reservations for 8:30
We asked if we could sit at a particular table, but were told: no, it's for parties of 3
Moments later, a couple was seated at the table in question
We spoke with the hostess and the owner, who seated us at another table, and offered an indifferent apology
Never followed up to see how we were
While there, we saw a half-dozen other parties leave in frustration
There is a place for restaurants with attitude, but it's certainly not the East Village
My friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant last night and were lured in by the amazingly inviting and cozy decor
Our waiter suggested a fantastic Greek wine that was far less expensive then we were willing to spend
My lady-friend had the Mediterranean sea bass special and I had the clay baked chicken in red sauce
Both dishes were wonderfully aeromatic and had that very non-generic home cooked taste and presentation
The atmosphere was fantastic and the service friendly and excellent
Our waiter complemented our meal with a traditional liquor that tasted like peaches and a pair of Camel Lights
In traditional homestyle fashion, we had to smoke them in the front yard
Job well done and we wish PYLOS many years of fantastic homestyle cooking in Manhattan
We will be back soon and often!
Note: I swear I don't work for this restaurant and actaully live across the street
This restaurant was so much more than I was expecting from the former owners of It's Greek To Me
First of all, the new name is a great improvement, as is the ambiance
Beautiful muted tones subtle lighting make this a great 'date' restaurant
I ordered the simmered lamb while my co-eater ordered the char-broiled lamb
I was a little take aback by the seemingly high pricing, compared with other Greek restaurants, but both lamb dishes were amazing and well worth the money
The service was charming (though the restaurant wasn't crowded at the time), and the wine, an inexpensive Retsina, was pretty subtle and tasty for Retsina
I highly recommend this place
15 people for lunch in a restaurant that was almost empty
10 minutes for menus - 25 minutes before the order is taken - 40 minutes for chips and salsa - 55 minutes we went inside to get our own water - 1:15 minutes for the sodas to arrive - 1:35 minutes before appetizers come out 1:45 minutes (and down 3 people) for the lunch to be served
Service was so bad - no explanations - no apologies, the entire meal was eventually comped
Had lunch there recently
The resturant was only 1/4 full
Service was extremely slow
They were out of the chicken tamales, so I had the chicken fajitas
They were good, not great
Waiter never checked on me
I had to have a different server re-fill my water
Took 10 minutes from time I was finished before someone realized and sent my waiter over
Poor service in Jersey City's only Mexican
In Short This sun-drenched bakery and antique kitchenware shop--a popular hangout among Park Slope's stroller set and Atlantic Mall shoppers--specializes in down-home desserts and snacks: Moist banana bread, sticky sour cream-nut cake and tall chocolate-ganache torte are favorites
A wide selection of oversized muffins, from apple bran to zucchini-plum, change daily
Wood tables fill at lunchtime, when empanadas, olive-onion-Virginia ham pizza and other snack-sized savories emerge from the oven
I came to Brooklyn from Manhattan to get a massage at D'mai, and stopped at Blue Sky for breakfast
I expected from the reviews that the muffins would be enormous (since that's what many of the other reviews said), but they were pretty normal-sized muffins
Not sure why everyone thought they were so big, but they're much smaller than the gargantuan Starbucks muffins and look like they came out of a regular muffin pan to me (and I bake a lot)
In any case, I had a very tasty piece of their chocolate chip banana loaf
Quite yummy, but not really worth going all the way to Brooklyn for if you don't live in the area
Also, don't go expecting to get a traditional muffin

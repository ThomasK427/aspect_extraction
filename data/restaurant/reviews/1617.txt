Very reasonable prices
Expected to pay a King's ransom but didn't
However, I was a bit surprised that I did not see duck, rabbit or foie gras on the menu
Maybe those items only come up in Specials
i like this cute little french restaurant
it's small dark and intimate
the appetizers were wonderful
we selected a cote du rhone and it went so well with my duck and everyone dishes on the table
we sat in front of a jazz band
a lil loud, but it made our stay a lil more enjoyable than usual
Jules is the bistro that you try to find in Paris, but end up realizing doesnt exist there anymore
The combination of live jazz, great food, super friendly European service, and an affordable bill made Jules a GREAT date
The only con I can think of was the fact that the cramped space combined with the music made the place almost impossibly loud
We both got soup, and appetizer, and a main course (fabulous duck), so we didnt have space for dessert
But the friendly waitress still brought over a dessert liquor and said it was on the house, a very nice touch, and one which really rounded out a great meal
I brought my out-of-town boyfriend here for a romantic late night dinner
The live band added to the ambience, and the food was good
Like most NY restaurants, you have to sit on top of the couple sitting next to you, but the vibe was still romantic
Great wine list!
This place has great comfort food
We've now been there twice and had great service and food both times
The onion soup isn't as good as Balthazar, but the hangar steak was excellent
I also had a filet mignon there that was wonderful
The noise level depends on where you sit
The back room is quieter
Front room is near the band and is good for drinks aprez meal
This is a great casual dining experience with friends, but not great for a quiet romantic evening or first date
the food is really really good
The band was really nice (we bought their CD)
But the place is too loud, so better to go there to listen to the music, not to chat!
the place as many have mentioned is noisy
a combination of live jazz and the voices of people screaming over each other
that coupled with the extremely slow service made for a very dissapointing evening
if the food had tasted better the experience might have been tolerable, but the tuna tartare was bland, the filet i ordered medium rare was instead rare and the vegetables were overcooked
the thought of sending the steak back was quickly dismissed when reminded of the extremely slow service
i did not want to stay any longer than necessary
Have been to Jules many times and it's always a treat
The music is great, and varies from night to night
The pre-theater menu is a great value
The fish is yummy, as is the sangria
The patio with ivy is great in the summer, and in the winter the restaurant is really cozy
The manager is very accomodating
It's a little hard to get the waiters' attention, but everything else is great!
I had dinner at Jules yesterday evening
The food was great - authentically French - but my dinner was spoiled by the terrible noise in this restaurant
There happened to be a jazz band playing between 8:30 and 11:30 and their music was so loud that I had to shout to make myself heard to my friend
I will NEVER go there again and I recommend you think twice before taking a date to this place
I recently went to brunch at Jules and loved my meal and the setting
There was live music and the restaurant itself is very cozy
It defnitely feels like you are in a a French Bistro! I will go back; next time I want to try their dinner!
We've dined there twice, and had a wonderful experience both times
The food is top notch
Tasty appetizers and excellent entrees
The only thing was the long wait till the entrees were served, but the good bread and the live music kept us occupied
We were guests at your restaurant on Saturday, June 18
French are infamous for having a rude service but I have been to France multiple times and never did I have this type of experience
Well, all I needed to do is to go to Jules
The service was horrible
The food was good but an attitude your waitress had, was awful
Unfortunately, I did not read reviews about your place in time
Apparently, it is quite a typical experience at your place
Want to ruin Saturday evening, just go to Jules!
My family went to Jules on Mothers Day
Jules offers a prix-fix menu from 5:30PM to 7:00 PM everyday
We all arrived at 5:30
When we were seated the waiter gave us the regular menu
My nephew inquired if the prix-fix was available and he said yes
The waiter then scurried around for copies
He then told us that there was only one steak left and that there would be no substitutions
My niece explained that was why we had chosen Jules and he still stated there would be no substitutions
We asked to speak to the manager, a sloppy looking individual, who abruptly stated no substitutions, no more steak and stormed away
We looked at each other in disbelief and proceeded to leave!!! If you are interested in being verbally abused, Jules is for you
OTHERWISE go somewhere in area like we did and have pleasant and delicious meal
For what it's worth, I'd like to point out that I try to avoid knee-jerk reviews full of complaints
However, for those of you that might think that means my review is to be ignored, you should weigh in the fact that I am at present overwhelmed with joy at the prospect that I am now out of this restaurant and never have to return
In summary: a terribly obnoxious and impolite host, a long and cramped wait for a table (complete with a mediocre bartender and drinks), more bad host, a calamari appetizer that may have actually been a joke, an hour's wait for our entrees, and tough chop-away-at-it veal
Despite a lovely atmosphere, this was perhaps the worst dining experience I've had in New York
With a glut of wonderful surrounding restaurants, Jules is to be avoided
I made reservations for 3 for a birthday dinner only to arrive and find they had lost our reservation
Luckily they were able to seat us an hour later after we went elsewhere for drinks
Food was delicious, atmosphere was lovely and the jazz was great, plus the waiters sang happy birthday in french
Considering how crowded the place was, I was amazed they didn't try to hurry us out but for the most part we had to get their attention when we needed something (like bread)
We were able to sit for an hour or so after dinner talking and listening to the music which totally made up for the reservation hassle
A nice mix of couples and groups
Dropped by twice this summer; first time for a hearty What happened? brunch for two; coffee was strong, outdoor table had plenty of fresh air, and a nice plate of eggs benedict at a good price -- gotta love it
Second time was a dinner for five; busy, but seated us promptly to the strains of live jazz
Beef carpaccio dizzied, frites pleased along with the moules they accompanied
Sangria disappeared almost as quickly as the flourless chocolate cake and creme brulee
Staff was great, restaurant was charming -- next time you need a bistro, go Jules
Having never tried French food but wanting to experience something European I decided to give this place a shot
I wasn't all dazzled with the food, it was good but I guess my salmon was a little too bland
My friends loved everything they ate
I'm not criticizing their food, just French fare in general
I made reservations that evening, got seated promptly by a great host
Our server was prompt and curteous
We stayed for nearly three hours
This reminded me of back home in Europe where you go out to dinner and talk, laugh, and stay therefor hours
I would go back
This is a great under the radar french restaurant
I found it on citysearch and took a good friend there for a girls' night for her birthday

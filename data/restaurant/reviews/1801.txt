The food was amazing, albiet overpriced
We split the quesadilla appetizer and tired the salmon and duck
Make sure to save room for dessert, as the white chocolate ice cream sandwich is heavenly
The margaritas were delicious and strong, but not worth $12
Although the food was great, the service was so bad that I can't see myself ever returning
Only the young woman who worked the coat room was friendly
Enjoyed our dinner at Bobbie's place
Every dish had new and interesting flavors to it
My dinner partner loved some dishes even when they were too hot for her taste
From the corn breads to the flan, we enjoyed everything we tasted
The place is hard to find even when you are looking for it ( that may have been due to the raging snowstorm)
The small canopy just says Grill on it
The decor was nothing to write home to the Midwest about but the food and service were great
Would try again but too many great places to eat on our next trip to NYC
We went to Mesa Grill last Saturday night for a special anniversary dinner
The food was excellent
We shared four appetizers, one main course (the salmon), and one dessert (warm chocolate cake) and really enjoyed them all
The margarita wasn't worth the money, however
Unfortunately, the service was very disappointing
Our waiter was inattentive and slightly condescending
Our waters weren't filled once in an hour and we had to track down someone to do it
Dirty plates were left on the table in front of us for much too long after every course
There were a lot of people working that night on the floor, but no one seemed to want to do their jobs
For the price and quality of the food, the service should have been a lot better than it was
I had high expectations going to Mesa Grill
It delivered! The dining room is somewhat generic but still nice
The food is the star here
Those looking for Tex-mex need to go elsewhere
It starts with the breadbasket
Rosemary rolls and blue corn muffins are unbelievable
You have to try not to over do it
Appetizers actually paled when compared to the entrees
While the crab cake, goat cheese fundido, and corn/sweet potato chowder were good, skip them and go straight to the smoked duck or the spiced pork loin
Sweet potato and pumpkin tamales are original and a perfect complement
Deserts are rich and well made
Service is very friendly and knowledgeable
People who write bad reviews of this place are either out of their mind or were born without tastebuds
I was able to secure a 8:30pm reservation on Saturday night for the balcony with no problem
There was no wait when we arrived and we were greeted by friendly and knowledgeable staff at every turn
The margaritas are perfect and the appetizers were divine
The sixteen spice chicken and pepper crusted steak were out of this world
The chocolate napoleon was the finishing touch on a magical night
I can't wait to go back!
I haven't been here for a while, so I was on guard after reading these reviews
First off, the drinks are nowhere near watered down
I was almost on the floor after one Catus Pear Margarita
They were delicious! I came here b/c of an out of town cousin, if it wasn't for her, we probably would have headed to Dos Cominos
But, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was
The portions are very small and the prices are VERY steep for mexican food
Most entrees being $30 and over
Come on Bobby, this isn't Le Cirque
I had the chopped salad and the duck
Although the entrees were good, there wasn't much of a Mexican flair to them at all
No guac, no chips, no mole salsa
Enough with the fusion cooking
Give us the real thing!
Bobby is great on TV but he needs to spend a little time at his restaurant
Our server was rude, unattentive, and she made us feel guilty for spilting orders and not ordering cocktails
The food was good but great
With so many great restaurants in NY, I suggest skipping this one
The portions are way to small for the time you have to wait in order to get them
and of course for the money you pay
The food looks good on the menu, but is nothing special when you get it
Simply put, if you go here you will get ripped off on mediocre food with bad service
It was a Friday night in August and we were on the balcony area -- I swear there was no air conditioning whatsoever
And if you ask me the place has frighteningly lame decor
Without dessert, the bill (only five people!) was over $500
An inexcusably awful resaurant
Oh, and they also dilute the drinks
Service was apathetic for a restaurant charging $75 per person
The decor was like nuveau kitsch
When I pay $14 for a margarita I at least expect to get my margarita served in a real margarita glass instead of a pickle jar
I have seen much better
I went there w/2 friends
We ordered Margaritas
We made the mistake of not calling out tequillas
We got what was obviously speed rack margeritas
They were mediocre and worst of all they were $11
00
The glass was also not a margarita style glass either
Nice atmosphere and good service but we could have gotten better drinks in many other places
Fan of the show - but not blinded to reality
Food was superb
My wife has a food allergy and the waiter went in to ask the kitchen about her selections and was truly concerned to get answers
Wait staff was there all the time - no problem with alouf-ness
No wait because we were there at opening
2 minor complaints
$11 for a drink is a bit pricey but the cactus-pear margerita is awesome
It sort of sets you up to worry about the final bill before you see a menu!  Menu items a bit high but worth it
I feel that if it was maybe 10-15% lower, I would frequent it more than once
Not everyone who watches FoodTV wears Armani, cooks on a Viking stove or drives a Beamer
We are working stiffs who like awesome food
16 Spice chicken was terrific!
I was excited to taste the very descriptive, mouth watering foods describe at Bobby Flays place
The cactus-pear margarita was delicious but NOT worth $11
The 1 crab-cake appetizer was delicious but again overpriced, the pork loin done to perfection but way overpriced for what it was
The wait service was horrible
Always had track someone down to get you water, drink order, take your order, refill the water, it was too much work always trying to find someone to help
DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY for someone who has a show on the FOOD network
I was extremely anxious to try out Bobby Flay's restuarant, which might have been why I was so upset by decent food, awful service, and high prices

We ordered three different dishes and each one was blander than the next
Anyone who thinks this is good Indian food needs to try to real thing
The food is cheap and the atmosphere is crazy but the food really isn't worth the ten dollars you spend
They couldn't even manage to get the naan right, they brought us out pita bread trying to pass it off as naan
I would recommend trying any of the other Indian food chains in the city over this place
If you ever remember saying to yourself This is the weirdest place I have ever been to, you will be wrong! because you haven't been to Milon
The host even brought out a nice plate of bread chips for our group to eat
Our group of 12 could easily fill up the entire space of this place yet magically we fit in with another 30! Personal space was not to be had and several times during the night couples mistakenly groped the wrong leg
The food is tasty and cheap (very), the staff is willing to please, you can bring your own alcohol, and everyone will definitely feel much closer to each other by the end of the night
There is also a very interesting Indian birthday song and strobe lights (a waiter turning the switch on and off!)
Bottom line: Good food, cheap, and oh yeah, bring a camera!
I would recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants a change
This is the type of place you can go on a date (it'll definitely give you something to talk about), or just hangin' out with friends
A friend of mines told me about this restaurant about 3 years ago
and i recommend it to my friends
The chili pepers and red wall paper is hard on the eyes
but you get used to it!  Just remember your personal belongings when you leave, since it'll probably be on the floor
the best place to go on your birthday - or better yet to recommend for someone else's birthday; milon comes up with the indian birthday song, strobe lights and a candle in your mango ice cream dessert (always free of charge)
come often and then you can specify that you don't want to be bussled out - it's so busy all the time that this is the main problem with the place!
Woo-hoo! My absolute favorite of all the indian row joints! Don't miss their Saag Vindaloo - it's a glorious (and HOT) take on a classic that I've never encountered anywhere else
Just don't bring a big group
I beg my friends to join me at this place! The food is unreal and a dinner for four (and I mean eating til you are overfull) will cost you about $30
you can't beat that with a stick
BYOB
One thing to remember though, always go to the left
You'll know what I mean when you get there
There's usually a wait outside Milon, despite the three seemingly identical neighboring restaurants
For good reason
Milon is packed with energy, from the red pepper-shaped lights that adorn - heck, that ARE the ceiling - to the semi-attentive marathon-running waiters
Pretty much all the standard NYC Indian fare is executed well - and it's absurdly cheap
Take your meal with a Mango Lassi (rich mango milk-shake ambrosia of the gods) and some excellent, warm Nan (comes with dipping sauce)
AND
Tell a waiter it's someone at your table's birthday
Just do it
First off, the food is delicious and is ridiculously inexpensive
The service is friendly and they really seem to appreciate their regulars (although I'm not one)
But the place is so small you're literally rubbing elbows with the diners next to you (avoid the back of the restaurant, it gets really narrow)
The decor is gaudy to the point that it becomes interesting
It's BYOB if you like alcohol (which keeps the bill down too)
Seriously, the doormen of Milon and the competition right next door try to get you in at their respective restaurants! It just adds to the fun! I took my brother here on his first trip to NYC, we ate way too much food for under 20 bucks for the both of us! Yet the service is that of a $50+/person meal! It is an experience! I love this place it is a special find!
If you need a good laugh and want some good cheap food- This is the place!!! If you want REALLY good laugh tell them that its someone in your party's birthday! ITS CHEAP AND TASTY- These people are right I spent $27 there on a meal for 2 and it was WAY TOO MUCH FOOD!!!!!!!!
I can't speak to the Carribean authenticity of Daphne's fare, but the jerk chicken and pork are the best I've had
I must also recommend the goat and oxtail
The veggie run-down is the real star -- I hadn't expected much, but it's an excellent plate of rice, beans, plantains and what tastes like a stewed cabbage salad: looks awful, tastes awesome
If the food turned south, I'd keep coming to Daphne's for two reasons: 1
The best scotch bonnet hot sauce I've ever had (spicy as anything, but with a nice sweet flavor) and 2
amazing home-made juice drinks and sodas
The ginger beer is the champ here, but you ought to try them all
This place is great
$10 pitchers of Bud, terrific bar food, and all NFL games on Sundays
This place is cheap and so much better for spending your football Sunday than the nightmarishly crowded Times Square ESPN Zone or a more trendy sports bar
I have lived here for 3 years and this is my second home
Amazing service, great variety of food and beverages and specials to die for
Great for football on Direct TV on Sundays (every Pats game shown in NYC), and partying hard on weekends with NYU kids and so many others
Great darts area
Nothing bad to say about this den of hedonism
Josie Woods is by far the best pub around NYU
They have great food especially their lunch specials
Their staff is excellent and on the weekends the place is packed with loads of fun people
I had the basil shrimp w/noodles, my friend had Panaang Vegetables and the veggie rolls--which were SUPER tasty
But the best part is the care our waitress took with our order, making sure the pan
vegetables only came w/the vegetables my friend wanted
SO nice and very rare in NYC! Recommended for lunch! Great deal on 3-course lunch special, $10
95 I believe
The prix fixe dinners @ $15
95/ person are a good deal: appetizer, soup, salad, entree dessert
The pad thai is one of their best dishes
Although, i wouldn't recommend the Pad See Ew- burnt and dry
The fried banana dessert was delicious! The service was very attentive and polite
In Short The turn-of-the-century posters, shiny brass railings, wood paneling and a 100-year-old marble bar make visitors half-expect to see bartenders sporting garters and handlebar moustaches
Especially known for its T-bone steaks, the restaurant serves a broad menu that includes pasta, ribs, seafood and giant, decadent desserts, like towering hot fudge sundaes or the famous cappuccino pie--a heaping hunk of chocolate pudding in a chocolate cookie crust topped with cappuccino flavored whipped cream
Knickerbocker may be known for its steaks beef but based on our recent experience, I recommend trying the no-beef dishes too
I was intrigued by a laquer duck entree which turned out to be a combination of duck breast done in a wine sauce with a wonderful vanilla flavor
It was accompanied by what I can only decribe as a duck taco; a sort of duck hash in a tortilla topped with a contrasting flavor mix of mangos, peppers and other ingredients
Sounds strange but it was a surprisingly tasty delight! My wife tried their crab cakes which she likewise found surprisingly filled with lots of crab and little filler and stuffing
She also recommended the grilled asparagus
The service was also surprisingly efficient considering it was a Sat
night and a name jazz pianist was playing
One word of caution
If you go to Knickerbocker to hear the music, go to a late set
It tries unsuccessfully to cater to both dinner crowd and a jazz audience at the same time
Once the diners have pretty much cleared out however, it can be a great place to enjoy some gret mucic without the usual pressure to keep drinking in order to keep your table
Went there for the first time this past weekend and left knowing we'd be back
My boyfriend had the T-Bone (the fried onions on top and the garlic mashed were AWESOME) and I had the Surf N Turf (also very good), and we both ended up with leftovers
Try the churros for dessert! Atmosphere was family friendly and service was good - we made reservations and were seated immediately
The food is superb and you shouldnt go if you want a quick/cheap meal
Put up with the loud sardine packed dining room and slow service youll be handsomely rewarded
The walls are richly decorated with Hirschfeld sketches and Coney island posters fabulously old NY decor
Thankfully, we called ahead because even with a reservation we still waited over half an hour to get a table
My ribeye was tender with a sumptuous sweet potato no need for butter or salt
My sister had filet mignon topped with portabellas her sides left A LOT to be desired after the filet
Between ten plates of t-bones, ribs, salmon and steaks, there wasnt a scrap left on the table
If it wasnt bad manners I wouldve picked up my chocolate souffl and licked the bottom clean
Three hours later and I was blissfully stuffed to the gills
Definitely recommend!
Knickerbockers is said to attract a 40+ crowd which is definitely the case
However, the ambiance is lively and warm and the service the same
The food was absolutely incredible with highllights being a steak house favorite; creamed spinach with nutmeg and you MUST try the chocolate souffle
To die for
My favorite in NYC so far

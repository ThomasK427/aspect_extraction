Our Place is our favorite Chinese Food on the Upper East Side and on our last visit they confirm our faith in them
We arrived after summer break to find wonderful new dishes including delicious Shanghai soup dumplings, which were a real surprise
The bean curd casserole was a real treat and a new favorite, and if there are any vegetarians in your party, the vegetable salad with wasabi dressing and the lilly bud salad were fresh and delicious
Everything was excellent and I can't recommend this restaurant more highly
The best
It's fabulous
Did I forget to mention it's the best
the three of us were starving and we wanted chinese very badly
we didn't want to go all the way to chinatown, so went to Our Place instead
we weren't dissapointed at all! their savory ribs, and spicy sprimp
this is the place is better than chinatown, and beats the long subway ride if you live on the upper east side
This was some of the blandest, most uncreative, and overpriced chinese i've ever had
This is not real Chinese food at all
Service was also terrible, slow and rude
Waiter was unable to make any reccomendations as to dishes
I repeat: stay away
Our waitress was
odd
She didn't really understand what we said (she spoke English, though) and we had to ask her for oil and vinegar three times before she brought it
Also, I ordered the linguine with mussels
and was brought the mussels appetizer
Because the food had taken so long at that point, I didn't feel like having it switched
So
I only really go for the sangria
Hardly makes up for the cold apetizers and the bland food
the food and drinks overall are great, but the lamb chops are to die for
I ordered 2 servings I liked it so much
My wife ordered the sauted calimari with spinich and keeps asking me to go back for it
Myself and a group of friends were recently in New York visiting from the Buckeye State and a suggestion was made to embark on the Panorama Cafe on the Upper East Side
We called ahead and were greeted by the most fantastic customer service I have ever encountered
They were very friendly but not overbearing, excellent time on order turnover, and I didn't run out of a drink at any point
(I highly recomment the Shiraz)
The food was top notch and very affordable
You leave the place feeling welcomed, full, and in an excellent mood
The people who work here make you feel welcome from the moment you step in to the moment you leave
They are truly hospitable Customer service is making people feel like they are at home and Panarama has mastered this art
This past sunday me and my girl stopped in Panorama for lunch
We left the place feeling like we had made a great discovery
The first thing that jumps out at you is HOW AFFORDABLY PRICED the PLACE IS
She had a bloody mary, it was nice and spicy
I had a margarita on the rocks with salt
The rim was loaded with so much salt, it was a work of art
We gave our order, and like what seemed like only 5 minutes , BAAM we had our food
I've never gotten a meal faster
She had a salad chicken
I had a chicken wrap that was excellent
The waiter was friendly
Got their coconut sorbet for dessert, comes right inside the coconut shell SO GOOD!!!!!!! We will definetely stop in again sometime during the weekdays, because I hear they have an upstairs dining area with outdoor patio seating!!!!
After evaluating several reviews on this site for this particular restaurant, I decided to try it for myself
The weather could not have been more perfect last night for such a place
Well, what can I say; it was a great experience! The menu was loaded with tasty selections
And the list of Specials was unusually large
Even though they were out of the special that Ive ordered, an almond crusted Halibut in a Grand Marnier sauce, the herb crusted, grilled Salmon in a Chianti sauce was just as delicious! My husband was also very happy with his pasta selection
The food, drinks, very friendly/ fast service, and the atmosphere were outstanding!! Oh, I forgot to mention the dessert
Mmmyummy! A decadent chocolate mousse cake was very rich yet so light! The restaurant was very affordable
Also, the outdoor seating was an added bonus!!! Definitely coming back!!!
I have been coming to Panorama for years
It has always been a wonderful experience
The food is delicious and comsopolitians are too good to be true
The waitstaff is friendly and the prices are great
I just introduced some new friends to the resturant over the weekend and they wanted to go here for new years dinner
Its a great date place or grab a group of friends and go for their drinks, because you can't go wrong with any drinks there
As I told my friend last weekend, this is the place you get the drinks you are afraid to get at other bars because of incompetant bartenders
Do NOT order the crabcakes! They are advertised as Maryland-style crabcakes
This is the furthest from the truth
I'm from Maryland, and if I ever tried to serve a crabcake like this down there, I'd be out of business in less than an hour
The service was great, but the food was kind of bland
I might go back to try something different, but was actually quite disappointed in the overall experience
Good food, resaonable prices, courteous wait staff
That is all!
Quaint setup with excellent menu with a romantic, dim-light setting
Cuisine is pretty darn good  good wine selection  good service  they have live jazz there some nights  prices are reasonable  What more do you want?
I usually go to Panorama for brunch on Sundays
The food is always good, the staff is friendly, and the prices are reasonable
Definitely reccommend it
Very nice atmosphere
I would reccommend reservations
My friend and I decided to sit at the bar, rather than wait it out for a table
Wait staff was pleasant and sociable
Had delicious steak tartare- really the best I've had in a while and j'adore le cuisine francais
Very good date resturant
Quiet enought to converse
Please do not bring young children
I love kids,in fact I teach, but this really is a good place for adults to have grown up conversation and fussing young children will not be appreciated
I remember discovering Jacques almost 2 years ago, I could not stop raving about the place, the food the amazing brunch
My husband took me here before proposing to me in the park, devine! However, the last 4 visits have been a HUGE disappointment to myself and our friends
The last visit being the absolute worst where they did not even have ice!! Who cannot have ice in this city? The quality of the brunches seemed to go further and further downhill, my eggs benedict completely stopped having any kind of runny yolk and the service got from relaxed to horizontal (we waited nearly an hour to order food last time, the place was empty of guests - and apologies)
The first few times we thought it must be an off thing, but the chances have all been given, we are off to Panorama Cafe for brunch now
shame
The UES from 70 on up is a veritable wasteland of good restaurants
That being said, this restaurant is a PLEASANT surprise
They consistently offer good French dishes that won't kill your wallet
My fiance and I eat here about once a month or more (during our steak frites cravings) and every time we leave full and happy
The steak is fresh, very nicely prepared and never has that meaty taste
The fries are scrumptious! Brunch here is a good deal as well, you get a drink, your entree and a huge helping of fries for the table
Would definitely recommend for a romantic night out
Jacques was one of the best expiriences I have had
The food was most amazing in its richness
I was very much more than pleased with my scallop dinner and my boyfriend's choice of duck
The portions were small but very filling

this is the best Indian food in the world, treat yourself to a good time and take a few friends to Agra! Dont be in a hurry because the service is laid back(but attentive), the food is worth the wait
You couldnt find better mutter paneer if you tried!
I'm no judge of the authenticity of Indian food, but the food was tasty and the atmosphere was really pleasant - up on the second floor you're removed from the city buzz and if the weather is good, it's pleasant to sit there with open windows
A nice place
If you're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy ambiance, this is quite and exquisite choice
Not only is the service great, but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable
There's candlelight and music
Very Nice! I definitely enjoyed the food as well
It was worth the wait
In Short A low-key, friendly environment attracts plenty of families to this reliable chain
Kids in the big booths--often clutching free balloons and crayons--usually outnumber adults sitting at the bar
The menu offers filling American fare with no surprises, from mozzarella sticks and nachos to rollups and burgers
Entrees include steaks, fajitas and main dish salads
The calorie-conscious can select from a list of Weight Watchers-inspired dishes like mesquite chicken salad and grilled tilapia with mango salsa
We went here around 10pm
Got seated right away
Very busy though and loud
Tightly packed in
There is a 17% automatic gratuity after 10pm, which you aren't told about until the bill comes
Everything was great, from the food to the service to the fun atmosphere
We had to wait 10 minutes, but it was a Saturday night, so we expected that
However, the food and service and of course prime location in Times Square made up for any bad feelings we had in the beginning
As for food, I love everything on the menu, but make sure you get your salad dressing on the side!
the food is top notch and the service can't get any better
it is a great atmosphere and everyone in the restaraunt does their best to make sure you have everythign you need
if you do go ask for a server named tony
he is truly one of a kind
combining knowledge and sensitivity with one of the best memories i have met
maybe the best server ever!!!
The downstairs bar scene is very cool and chill
you take the elevator upstairs to your table, where the prix fixe meal greets you
The food was definitely good, but when all was said and done, I just couldn't justify it for the price (including 2 drinks, $100/person)
in a city with hundreds of top quality meals, this place just didn't hit the sweet spot
great rooftop room, lovely gastronomic creations combined with a low attitude staff
Great inventive pan-asian food, beautiful space, multi-level restaurant, lounge on the ground floor perfect for after-work cocktails
I used to go to this Baluchis all the time with my wife, then we stopped for a little while
When we went back recently we found that it had changed and not for the better
They did not serve any papadam or chutney like they used to, we had to keep on asking for water and it took a long time for us to be waited on (and the place was not crowded)
But the biggest smack in the face came at the end
I normally eat a lot of rice, so I asked for an extra serving
When I got the check, I found that they charged me for it! Most Indian restaurants don't charge for extra rice! Needless to say, I was deeply offended by this
The food was decent, but not worth the cost, especially considering the service
I won't be going back there again
Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent
He offers subpar service and has no personality
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho
There is no excuse for such lousy service!
I'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much
The food at this place is 'gourmet' Indian cuisine
Its not curry in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill food
The food is excellent and I have found this location at 104 2nd Avenue to be the most consistent with its food and short menu
The best dishes are the 'paneer bhurji', the 'Baluchi Shrimp Curry' and 'Chicken Makhani'
The manager had an uncanny knack of getting the most rare and eclectic music comprising of indian/trance/dub/fusion to add to the ambience
However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup
Food is still great and comparitively inexpensive
Definite go if you're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad
Paying this much $$$ for basic Indian food is ridiculous
Baluchi's adds salt to the injury by serving up overcooked, overspiced and all-round mediocre food
If you're in the 'hood looking for Indian food, are afraid of some of the restaurants on 6th street and don't want anything trying to be nouveau indian with the associated price tag/small portions - you can count on baluchi's
it's not a fancy place, but atmosphere is fine, food is good, prices are reasonable
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw
and for this i had to shell out a small fortune? (not even to mention baluchi's, most irrtatingly, chages you extra for rice and all and sundry condiments!) i don't think so! this happened specifically at this location, but it had happened on enough many occassions on several other baluchi's last couple years for one to conclude that baluchi's has lost it
go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!
This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location
During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better
I wish they would change back to what it was before
The food now is inconsistent
The BEST Chinese food Uptown! Speedy delivers, great food, decent prices, and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast
The Yang Chow fried rice will make you wanna sm@ck somebody's Mama! Design Your Own dish helps the weight watcher crew! The cold sesame noodles, which are a freebie when you order $10+, are delectable
The avocado salad is a personal fave
And, the honey BBQ rib tips are yummy!
Lots of choices for food
I grab lunch there every now and then
I rarely sit down to eat as seating seems hard to come by
but the workers are friendly and the food is fresh and healthy
except for the Krispy Kremes in the corner!
Great place for groups
Cynthia is a very gracious host
The food was delicious
I mosied on in with a friend last Sunday, and we went back two days later with another friend because we had so much fun! The lady is more entertaining than a one woman show! Skip the theater, go to Cynthia's
The ambience is lovely, with exposed brick and a fireplace
Our wait staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous
The food is unique, eclectic, and very affordable
Something for everyone and every Thursday is Thanksgiving! Both times we went in, there was lots of room
The seating is very spacious too
Cynthia makes everyone feel like an old friend
Cynthia's is great
My favorite is the pan roasted duck breast and the leg confit
it is very reasonable compared to the restaurants on 8th avenue
It's a laid back place free of attitude
There are a lot of locals that come in, and everyone loves to hang out with Cynthia, who is a great hostess and makes everyone feel welcome
The burgers are good, much better than corner bistro, and the new carmel roasted pear is pretty awsome
Her greatest touch is homestly thanksgiving dinner every thursday
She roasts 25 pound turkeys every thursday morning, complete with stuffing, a healthy portion of mash, and all the trimings
Horrors! The woman does not know customer service, food is mediocre
Cynthia sits at your table without being asked and does not let you eat in peace
Don't ask her to bring the lights up a bit so you could see the food and menu and do not, I repeat, dare ask for bread and butter
Don't ask for desert, don't ask for anything

I switched plates with my boyfriend hoping his food was better, it was just as bad!!!! Never again!!!!!!!!!! Drinks were the best thing on the menu, lots of options! I had a passionfruit cosmo, to wash the nasty taste in my mouth the food left
If you are looking for authentic Asian food, go to places that has Asians making the food, not just the sushi! To sum it up, too Americianized for me, I should have just had a burger!
my new all-time favorite restaurant!!!! discovered it accidentally this summer although i live in manhattan
never been disappointed with any dish i ordered - sushi dumplings are delicious
recommend highly to anyone!!!!
In one word: Overrated
I have been to Ruby Foo's more than 10 times
Why? 1st - I work in Times Square, and we tend to take clients to this convenient location
2nd - I go there only when my company is paying for the bill
Ruby Foo's is overpriced and overrated as far as food, service and value are concerned
For an overpriced, times square restaurant - go here
Otherwise, save your money - walk down a couple blocks, and find a true gem of a NY Restaurant
while the drinks and the service were great, the food failed to impress
great spot for drinks after or before a show but stay away from the overpriced and bland food
Lovely place with beautiful decor and courteous staff
Came here with a small group of friends for a birthday dinner and had a wonderful time
The food was flavorful and beautifully presented
You must try everything! Close to the theater district so it's a perfect place to go before or after you see a show
Go to Foo's for the signature Ruby Foo drink and sit to people watch
We spotted several celebs during our sat night visit
Call ahead for reservations or be prepared to wait
the hustle and bustle of this place is amazing
they got it down like clockwork
it's definetly an experience everyone must try at least once
and i LOVE their food
i've been here a number of times and have never been disappointed
do make reservations if you plan to eat pre-theater
and despite all the mediocre reviews, i find the place to be a great value
especially if you mix and match the apps and special maki rolls rather than ordering entrees
the portions are decent and not overwhelming and the pan-asian fusion makes for some very interesting flavor combinations
it's like a party in your mouth! highly recommended
This place is huge when it comes to Asian restaurants! The decor is tasteful and not tacky or lacking
The metal chopstick holders are ingenious! Best bet is to order a bunch of appetizers and make a meal of it
The main entrees are pretty boring and a bit bland
Desserts are great as well as the service! The waitstaff is very humerous and attentive
If the chef would jazz up the main menu with more seasonings and spice, this gem would shine more
like many other curious weekenders, we decided to give ruby foo's a shot a few weeks back
despite a reservation there was still a half hour wait to be seated by the seemingly disinterested hostess
once seated things improved however
the sushi was quite good, and the kung pao is by far the best ive ever had
expensive, but hey what isn't in new york
if you havent been, try it once, definately an experience
This Ruby Foo's location may offer the same menu, but the atmosphere does not compare to uptown location
At peak times, the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close
If you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location
You won't be dissapointed
The restaurant was too bad in terms of decor, though I have seen better
My dishes were great though, especially the dessert list
For the pride its worth it
While most fine dining establishments don't have huge portions Ruby's does
The service can get slow during prime time, but overall I was satisfied
The food is good but not great; definitely a thai spicy influence, but overall its not that imaginative
This is one of the best restuarants I've been to in New York
Their Dim Sum is great and I've been craving it ever since I first ate it
The atmosphere is nice although some tables are a little close together
It's a little bit pricey but worth it
Their spicy is true spicy, not adjusted for the American palate
I highly recommend the Bento Box for desert and the salmon is exquisite
The wait staff and hostess are extremely welcoming and friendly and help make the experience complete
Don't miss this great restuarant!
The food is such fluff and so overpriced
What a ripoff! In addition, the hostess and managers were totally not customer friendly
What a terrible waste of time and money on this restaurant!
Foo's is Fantastic!! I went here a few weeks ago with a bunch of friends, and had a great time! The menu was extensive and offered a wide selection of wines and cocktails
Make reservations or you might be waiting for a looong time
Although its not very romantic, its perfect for dinner and drinks!
This was a pleasant surprise
We went here with old friends who had just come in from the West Coast and we could not get reservations to any of the restaurants that were recommended
We had no problem getting in here and were very surprised
I am a very fussy eater and found each dish we tried delicious
Another important factor- very clean and service was good
I found the food here very expensive, and poorly executed
The Tamarind spareribs, were so overpoweringly sour from the Tamarind, that it masked all other flavours
This is good if you are eating a lemon, but not a piece of meat
The Pad Thai was covered in a insipid tomato sauce that had more in common with the good people at Heinz than the Royal Kingdom of Thailand
Very poor
The food is terrific, and the concept of being able to order several small plates of food is terrific
But those small plates are priced like big ones! And the big plates are priced even bigger!!! And every time I go I say, no more, too expensive
but yet as I wait for the crosstown bus in front of the restaurant, I can smell the food and ohhhhhh
We went there with a couple who were dying to try it
They reallly liked liked it, but we didn't
The service was good, the atmosphere was also nice, but the food taste and quality were horrible
My spring roll was a little baby shrimp surrounded by cilantro and greens
The price was good for NYC, but not worth the food quality
I won't go back!! There are a million other Pan-Asian resturants in the city that have better food at better prices
Overrated place with interesting decor but it gets old after the first time
Average Asian food
don't confuse quantity with quality
Pan Asian places make me wary but Ruby Foo's does a great job with the food and decor
We decided to drop in for a 3 PM Saturday late lunch after waiting on line for TKTS
The waitstaff was more than knowledgeable and I was steered in the right direction for their noveau style sushi
The tuna and fruit rolls were great
(Plus points for our waitress who took off a roll from the bill which we didn't order but let us eat it anyway
) A delightful dessert was the Bento Box sampler where dessert items were made to look like sushi
Good thing we meandered in at an off time for as we were leaving at 5 PM, the place started to become crowded and the line was getting long
We ate here for my birthday, and I would love to go back, but no longer live out east! Everything was great
The chicken in lettuce cups, dumplings, etc
were fantastic
The chocolate cake is HUGE- enough for 4! The decor is appropriate, but the place is so huge that it doesn't provide an intimite setting
Our table was literally lined up with a few inches between us and the next table

be prepared
Good place to drop in and grab a quick bite
Solid all around for dinner and lunch
Accomodating wait staff
Like any place in the meat packing district, it's not easy to get to unless you live in the hood or have a car/cab/bike, etc
I just discovered this place a year ago, after years of wondering what all the hype was about
Don't let the low prices fool you -- the food is SPECTACULAR
The burger is my favorite -- char-grilled served on an English muffin -- but everything else I've had there is wonderful, and portions are huge
GReat friendly service that always remembers you the next time you're there
Crowded, casual, hip and fun, but not pretentious, and open 24 hours almost the entire week
Killer brunch, fab dinner, excellent for last-minute cravings
Floent is an all around great place for an late night/early morning answer to that craving
They also have a great Sunday Brunch menu
Florent has been a favorite late-night/early-morning dining spot of mine for years
It's very chill and they have great food
O
K
junk food place that could do well with a good cleaning
I'm not sure what part of 'medium' the cooks did not understand when they received our order
Such a shame since this place seems to have all the right elements, hip, fun location with a pleasing selection across all menu categories
If you can't get the food right, what's the point? Stale bread, meat overcooked on all orders
We all know you get one chance in Manhattan
Unfortunately on the night we were there, it was missed
Great brunch place
Excellent HOMEFRIES!!!! The manager (Tall, thin, black guy
sorry that I dont know your name, is the best
He is always upbeat and smiling
he understands the service business!
Goat cheese and apples in an omlete who would have thought
Eggs Benedict at 3 am or 3pm or 3am and 3pm depending on what kind of night you had
That Beneict guy must be french because this place makes some of the best I've had
Their Bloody Mary's, which are the key to a good brunch special, leave something to be desired
But what they lack in Bloody Mary they make up for in delicious omletes, eggs benedict and some other french foods I can't pronounce
I think they even have snails
I would complain about the service but the lackadaisical, non pretentious nature of their waitstaff is almost comforting and makes you wonder why you are eating such fine cuisine in a place that looks and feels like just another diner
Been out late in the Village or Chelsea and need some solids and/or coffee to counter the alcohol? This is the place to get relief
Dark (won't shock the eyes) and comfy--I've fallen asleep in a booth--with food that is not pretentious but is very good
Try it! it is worth the way to the meatpacking district!
Love the Sunday brunch
Eggs florentine is my favorite
How can you go wrong with hollandise sauce
Coffee is great
Tough decision is whether to pick a mimosa or chocolate moussee
I've been with a clear head and the food was great
I've been without a clear head and the food was great going in and coming back up
Really excellent food -- comfort food, yes, but usually with a more imaginative twist than that implies
The retro-funky decor's fun, but you're best off going at offpeak hours to avoid the mob scene during primetime
Fortunately, with these hours, that's not hard to do
Staff are sweethearts
I order from Manatus 3 times a week
Good, solid diner food - helpful, nice staff happy to take special requests and quick delivery
Highly recommended
The other night my girlfriend and I were shooping on Blecker street when we decided to get something to eat
We noticed the Manatus restaurant and decided to give it a world
Boy, were we ever pleased
The atmosphere was friendly, alive and warm
The staff was very attentive and pleasent
We both had the Seafood Paella and loved it
The seafood was fresh, and the rice was so soft and fluffy
It's definetly a nice place to eat and relax after shooping
So i recommend it after a day of shooping, It's the perfect place to sit, eat, drink and gossip with a friend
I work very closeby to Manatus, and my coworkers eat here a lot
The first time I ordered from Manatus was over the phone, to be delivered to me just down the street
I ordered a veggie burger
Cheese costs extra, and I did not ask for cheese, but it came with cheese on it anyway
On both sides of the burger! So it was impossible to scrape off
Called back, another would be sent two hours and two phone calls later
Gave the place another chance and dined inside several weeks later
Slowest service ever
Waitor was nice, though
Don't go on your lunch break
This is a great little place to eat with friends or for a relaxed evening with a date
The atmosphere is cosy, the service attentive but not intrusive and the menu choice is amazingly large but features pretty standard fare
Food portions are sizeable enough for most appetites, with prices which are terrific value
Definitely recommended!
It's the best eats I've had in a while! If you're looking for somewhere to relax hang out and get some good grub this is the place to be! Oh and by the way, the burgers are outta this world too!
Visiting from Alabama we just happened to wander in for dinner
The food was great, service was good, and the price was very reasonable
It had a nice ambiance also
Cozy diner in the heart of the village
I've tried Paul's Palace's burgers which I found too soggy and Corner bistro's which are too pricey! Manatus serves a tasty, juicy chargrilled burger(the bacon/mushroom is the best!) with a load of fries and onion rings and also a greek salad(with their own dressing which is out of this world) for about 10 bucks, enough food for 2 to share
This is what are burger should be like
They also deliver until the early morning hours to soak up that brewski
The Scene The downstairs performance space hosts a packed calendar of poets, novelists, storytellers and musicians
On Saturday evenings, a multi-cultural reading series features work by writers from the Arab-American, Italian-American, Russian-American and Greek-American communities
The Food Unlike its ritzier neighbors--Po, Home, etc
--Cornelia Street Cafe remains true to its humble beginnings, offering such contemporary cafe fare as grilled portobello sandwiches and fish and chips
Lunch (a chicken sandwich on baguette with fries) was decent, brunch (dry, hard pancakes) was pretty bad
I respect the fact that Cornelia Street cafe is a village institution and I love that they promote painters, writers, and musicians, but I don't think it's worth it to come here for the food
Bread with brunch, listed as chocolate bread, actually turned out to be two of Amy's (a bakery around the corner)challah/chocolate chunk breadsticks stuck together--and cut in half to make a square
That was pretty poor, I thought, and weird
The nicest part of the restaurant is the bar/entrance room, where there are always people hanging out and chatting
However, it would be pretty uncomfortable and hectic to sit and eat in there when the restaurant is busy
It's a popular place-- due more to reputation than to great food or service
I go to the place 3 nights a week
It's right around the corner from my apartment, and although the food isn't the greatest in town, there is a nice sense of community and belonging
the way it used to be in the village
We went back several times to give more chances to this place
We liked the food, the decor and the atmosphere
However, we were treated poorly all 4 times we went there

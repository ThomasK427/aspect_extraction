We were in our own little world, with no one to bother us and our own private bartender
The food was great(as always), and then we just hung out for the rest of the night having drinks and lounging
For anyone looking to have a private dining experience, or a private cocktail party, 24 Prince should be at the top of your list
As I often do, I was trolling around city search to find a few likely candidates of new restraunts in NYC worth the trouble of traveling outside of my neighborhood
I noticed the exteme contradiction of a 9
3 overall rating for 24 Prince coupled with a few poor service comments



so I HAD to check it out- just to see for myself
I grabbed my gal and we headed downtown for some din-din
We were greeted warmly and lead to corner booth in the center of this homey-retreat
The food was satisfying and deliciously prepared; from Grandma's fried chicken (I think grandma might actually be IN the kitchen cooking from her own recipes) to the Apple crumble (with CHEDDAR CHESSE ice cream!)


and the service was very good: unpretentious yet competent and caring
My gal and I truly enjoyed ourselves we'll be traveling again soon!
Excellent Tasty Food
This is the type and taste of food you want, if not making it for yourself or the fantasy that you want someone to make it for you
Great location
We stopped in with 5 in our party
Waited for 10 minutes and got promptly seated
Smiles from the staff, and great attention given, down to the water refill service
A little noisy when it gets crowded, yet a great hip vibe
Price is a definite factor for our return visit, along with the food and service
I had passed by this place several times until a neighbor told me I should try it
We waited for 45 minutes to get a table and when I asked how much longer it would be, the hostess was very crabby
When we finally got our table, we were rushed the entire time
It seemed like a lot of people in the restaurant were really concerned about my table, staring at me and my friends
The food was just okay
I had a salty salad and some boring macaroni and cheese that would of been okay if it came in a box marked stouffer's
The desert, I must say was great
Peanut butter and jelly
We all really enjoyed it until the check was suddenly given to us while we were still eating! Later, I found out my neighbor knows the owner, so I guess that explains it!
What a find! After a very busy day apt
hunting, my husdand and I found ourselves at 24 Prince Street
It was just what the doctor ordered
As we walked in the front door, a very nice young lady greeted us
She seated us in the back by the very clean restrooms
(no I'm not complaining, just making a point)
The service was excellent, the waitress can right over and so did the bus boy
The food came soon after our drinks, we had the meat loaf, I didn't care for the greens, but my husband loved them
The Chef, and one of the owners came by our table to welcome us, ( we are from upstate NY), how nice was that!!!! Anyway, we finished our meal with the PJ Sandwich dessert for 2
what a treat
When we visit our daughter in NYC, we will visit 24 Prince Street again
I went to a friends birthday diner at 24 prince a couple of weeks ago and had a great time in the private room
Everything was great and having your own room really made us feel VIP
So if you have a large enough group looking to have dinner at 24 prince make sure you ask about their private room
Don't forget to try one of the cocktails
Upon entering a new restaurant in my 'hood, as I opened the door I was pleasantly greeted with a smile from the cutie behind the bar
Another gentleman asked if he could take my coat and asked if I would be joining them for dinner
I was waiting for another guest and decided to sit
I enjoyed a great glass of red and looked over the menu
We decided to order a bottle of the red - that was warming my body from the cold
We ate the downtown chopped salad, meatloaf, and the burger
It was the best meal to complement my wine
The gentleman who sat us, said that we MUST have dessert and sent us a complimentary Banana Bread Pudding
2 words - Perfect Comfort!
My friends and I came here for dinner last night, we waited about 5min (probably because of the impending blizzard)
At first the host was rude and I was thinking that all the reviews about the bad service were right, but he must have had a bad moment because he then turned on the charm and was amazing all night
The food is okay, but not great
I had the fish n chips which were a lacking flavor, but my friends orderd the meatloaf and the risotto which were amazing
The famous mac n' cheese starts to harden after a while, so eat it fast! Overall, I would recommend this restaurant, but it's not something I would go back to for a second meal
(PS
They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more)
I stopped into this place last night with four-friends; we were seated promptly and received great service
The food was tasty and generously portioned
It seemed that everyone around us was really enjoying themselves
Our server also mentioned that they have a garden that they will be opening in the Spring; and while I look forward to that I'll deffinately be back well before then!
The food was great, the service was friendly and its comfortable
I had the fried chicken and it was as good as I read in Time Out
My friend and I tried the spiced peach cobbler cocktail and we are hooked
Make sure you save room for dessert
I went here to eat last night
The atmosphere was nice
However, the service wasn't all that
It all began with the bar tender
Then it gradually got worse and worse with each of the wait staff that we encountered
Each and everyone of them just had bad attitudes
They should really get someone in there to coach them how to talk to people
Besides, the sucky service the food was okay especially the dessert
I don't think I'll ever go back again due to the service though
All in all I loved this new spot and plan on making myself a regular
The space in nice, service friendly and both the food and drinks will bring me back
Everyone in my group agreed what a great addition this restaurant was to the area specially when we saw how low the check was
I've been to 24 Prince on 3 occassions for different reasons
I'm still trying to figure out all the hype
I think the food and service have gotten progressively worse
It's one thing not to rush customers but they just totally forget about you
The mac and cheese rolls were good the first time around, but the last time I had them they didn't have any cheese inside
The space and the decor are nice, but overall, it's just not worth it
Skip this overpriced loser
Service is horrible
My party had a reservation, we were seated at 8, ordered by 8:20 and didn't get food until 9:30
Waitress kept trying to get us to order more drinks while apologizing but wouldn't even bring bread to keep us from starving
Said she would tell the manager, but if she did, no one came over
A good restaurant would have at least comped desert or sent over a round of drinks for such a long wait -- we didn't even get an apology from a manager
And it wasn't even crowded
Spend your money where you'll be treated better, and the food was just OK
We were seated on soft faux like leather banquets with the perfect amount of light to be able to read the menu but still a comfortable setting

Cobble Grill used to be one of my favorite spots to grab takeout
The Salmon BLT was awesome and the value was great
Now, they've raised their prices by at least $2 on every dish and got rid of some of their best sandwiches
For a place that is pretty much a takeout joint - minus the one or two tables - $9 for a burger is rediculous
I want the old Cobble Grill back
Cobble Grill is one of my families favorites
They make the BESt burgers and skirt steak sandwiches, and whatever they put on their fries
we're addicted
Everyone inthe neighborhood told us to order from there when we moved here and we are glad we found them
Food is great, they are friendly when we call and treat us like family
Prices are really fair for the huge amount of food you get
The Scene This spacious restaurant mixes modern sushi bar decor with bistro touches like dark wood, exposed brick and stainless steel fans
An analog clock is projected on one wall and diners can enjoy the sunshine in the wood-decked back garden
Classics like sushi, teriyaki and udon are supplemented with an extensive roll list that includes a few surprises like the Green Twister, which wraps crispy flounder in spinach
A limited Thai menu is also available
sorry kotobuki, but i hate to say this
you're just average
you have tough competition in brooklyn as far as sushi goes (faan, osaka, shinjuki, etc
) so you might want to study up on what the others are doing right
In Short Brick-exposed walls, attractive servers, and low lighting lend this slim cafe a romantic air
Local couples and young families slide into tightly packed tables or head to the backyard for more spacious seating
A wide selection of Italian meats and cheeses are served as antipasti or piled onto crusty paninis
Diners snack on Tuscan tomato-bread soup and bruschetta, or feast on braised pork, lasagna, and baked macaroni
Gelati, sorbetti, and classic Italian desserts like tiramisu seal the meal
The menu is divided up into several sections, and most of the dishes are smallish plates, like tapas
The good part is that I've never had a single bad dish here, ever
The bad part is that it's very easy to go overboard ordering little plates of everything! But if you can, be sure and save room for the best macaroni and cheese in the city
Their drinks menu is also terrific
One of my favorite places to take people in the neighborhood
Every Friday Night Toni I dine on Smith Street
Last Friday was St
Patrick's Day and the local pub's were packed with people that had been drinking all day
We opted for happy hour at Panino'teca 275
Pom Cosmos for $4
We've been here so often over the years it's become our comfort food place
Highly recommend the bruscetta - all of them
I've been several times and was very satisfied each time
The food is wonderful, the service is friendly
Great inexpensive wines and specials and desserts!   Re criticisms: I love the mushroom bruschetta, and definitely recommend
I think they are creminis, much more flavorful than buttons
And texture is a matter of preference; I like bruschetta crunchy
One disppointment was the cauliflower truffle bruschetta, which was bland; i think salt white pepper would do wonders
My boyfriend and I go there and share stuff, and in the end the bill is always VERY reasonable, and we always leave full!   THey have an AMAZING eggplant/polenta torta thing that I can't go on enough about
It is a great place to go have good food and wine and hang out and a casual, friendly, and relaxing atmosphere
Had a late afternoon get-together with a friend here yesterday
After having a watery vodka cocktail I switched to satisfying and cheap happy hour Peronis
When it was time for a snack, we were not entirely happy with our bruschetti
First of, the toast was way too hard and crumbly, it should've had just a tad of softness left in the center
Then there was the matter of the 3 toppings we tried
The tomato was fine, plentiful, well flavored, etc, but the mushrooms were just a pile of unflavored and soggy button mushrooms (we hoped for something like wild mushrooms) and the garlic was basically the same
Plus the server was catty and unresponsive, which made us want to leave earlier than planned
This place is mad expensive in comparison to other places in the neighborhood
For example, a panini is $9 and is really good, but it doesn't come with anything like a small salad on the side
The bruschetta is $3
50 each, and all you get is one small piece of bread with a topping on it
I must say, over all the food is pretty good, but you can get food that is as good if not better ofr a much cheaper price in the hood without sacrificing ambiance
I count Panino'teca 275 as one of my favorite neighborhood spots - and I live in Manhattan
Great food at great prices, a hip but relaxing atmosphere, and sincerely kid-friendly (toy box, will gladly heat a bottle for you, and the staff doesn't make you feel like you have some nerve having a baby in the city as can tend to happen)
The new garden is gorgeous and HUGE!
Great Italian food
Friendly and attentive staff
Accommodating for large groups
Love the jukebox full of classic tunes
Often live music on the weekends
Definitely worth trying!!
The Sushi is to die for! With each piece of sushi your mouth waters with each piece
The colorful walls and exotic decorations bring out great times with friends and family
With the help of a friendly staff this restaurant is a must try
i would say its Brooklyn's best sushi with an alluring dining room and an outdoor seating
The decor is gorgeous and makes you relax and enjoy your meal
Its a great place to bring the family or even just a date, great for any occasion
I loved the ambience and presentation of food here so much, It was absolutely breathtaking
Riviera Grill Sushi has been my favorite restaurant for over 3 years
From its Incredible Sushi Roll, to its delicious Aged stake there is no place in New York that prepares it better! The desert selection is just unbelievable from my favorite D-Napoleon to the Cheese cake lolly-pops, and absolute Devinne
The restaurant has a beautiful out door Patio which can be use all year round, it is very nice decorated and it has a great ambiance
The Waiters are absolutely incredible, friendly and very very attending!! I highly recommend The Riviera Grill Sushi to anybody in New York, it is worth the Trip no matter where you live
One of the best in Brooklyn
Very diverse menu, prompt and friendly service
Pricey buy well worth it
At last, a little neighborhood bar near the DeKalb L! Totally unpretentious, tiny, and comfortable
Decent Mexican food (pretty good salsa verde) and a very friendly staff
the entire menu is in Chinese
So if you're in the mood for cheap ($16
95 for 3 dishes, rice, and soup, $5 each additional dish), then grab some literate friends
Theres better food across the street at (sorry, I only know the Chinese name) Nan Bei Huh and Yangzte River Restaurant (esp
their pan-fried buns at the latter!)
I believe they also have the $16
95 specials
The dcor is amazing for a Chinese restaurant in downtown Flushing
For a group of 10 or more, you get a curtained-off room, one of which has a karaoke system
=)
This place has above average spicy tofu, and the service is very polite
The place is usually calm uneless there is a group of people in the front, but that doesn't affect the experience much at all
This is pretty much the best place to go for tofu in the area, and it's very affordable
The boolgolgi and kaibi are pretty good too
Beware: Korean tofu caserole soup in this little joing is addictive
The tofu melts in your mouth and the broth
ohmigod
the broth
leaves you craving for more after you leave

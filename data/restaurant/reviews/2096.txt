Overall food was very good
I was really disappointed in the wine and water
THe wine list ranged from $65 to $2000 for reds
I have been to tuscany, and, trust me, the wine selection was a rip off
Also another disappointment was the Water bottles
Private Labeled Dasilvano salty water which the waiter kept pouring
The other dissappointment was the service
If you dont order the $252 bottle of wine, you wont get good service
hmmmm I recommend this restaurant if you dont drink and you dont mind attitude from your waiter
Went here on a weekday night with my wife and had to wait a while for a table but it was definitely worth it
When we were seated, we were greeted by a friendly waiter who was knowledgable about the food wine
The wine selection was great by the way
My wife had gnocchi with gorgonzola which was very good
I'm more of a meat-eater and ordered a veal dish which was excellent
The food came out in a timely manner and served fresh hot
Overall I'd have to say it was an excellent dining experience
After reading many favorable reviews, it seemed like this place would have been one to impress - however it was a huge disappointment
The wine list had only a few bottles around $40, with the rest being over $100 (which were the ONLY ones recommended by our waiter, I wonder why)
The food was very average - have had much superior Italian in other City restaurants
The pricings are amazingly high for the quality of food and service
Recommend going elsewhere
Went here for lunch with some co-workers
The service was very attentive and knowledgable of the wines and food
Everyone's meal came out in a timely manner and the food was fresh and delicious
I wanted to stay for dessert but had no time so we ordered a couple items to go
This is also a great spot to people watch
I plan on going back, next time for dinner with my wife
By the reviews we thought our experience would be great, however we were wrong
The bread and pasta were really great, but the House salad was so salty that we couldn't get it down
The waitstaff was not on top of us and forgot both our wine and tea
Questioned the price of the tea ($7)and was told my husband had two
The day is coming that people will soon be charged for a refill of coffee too! Give me a break! We found several other friendly restaurants on our trip that weren't so stuffy
Lots of talk about Da Silvano so I had to try it for myself
We made reservations on a Wednesday night
We were seated promptly
The service was excellent and our waiter was knowledgable about the extensive wine list
My friend and I ordered three dishes to share so we could try a few different things
The pasta dish(rigatoni) was cooked perfectly and was quite tasty
We also ordered a veal dish and a shrimp dish which had tomatoes, scallions, etc
Both dishes were very good
There was no room for dessert but I'm glad we finally came here
My wife and I went here without reservations on a Tuesday night
The wait was a bit long but luckily a table opened up
We started with a salad which was very fresh ith a nice mix of greens
We also had the mussels as an appetizer which were very good
Our entrees were quite tasty
We shared two dishes: meat tortellini in a cream sauce which we loved and veal with risotto, also very good
No room for dessert since we had a couple glasses of wine during our meal
We'd wanted to go here for a while and I'm glad we finally did
We've been going to Da Silvano for years because of the delicious food, excellent wine list and friendly staff
The pasta is always cooked perfectly, the seafood always fresh and the attention to detail exemplary
As long as Silvano continues his ways, we'll continue to go
We went here with a group of 4 on a busy night
Even though it was very busy, the waiters were very courteous and the food was served fresh and in a timely manner
We drank a bottle of white wine from the extensive list and shared a couple different Antipasti dishes(fried zucchini artichoke with vinaigrette)
We all had a different entree(rib eye, roasted duck, linguine w/ clams and lamb) and were all quite pleased
Everything we ate was delicious and cooked perfectly
The hype is there but so is the food!
I went with my wife for dinner last week and had a terrific experience
The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious
We had calamari and oysters for appetizers which were both very good
My wife had the gnocchi which was cooked perfectly
I had the roasted veal which was also very good
We were too full for dessert but we'll be back again to try some next time
the best food end service the staff is only italian  so is the real italian plece to go
good food good service  good music
Da Silvano has lost its touch
The service was appalling and we dont expect alot
just a little respect
The staff is so busy entertaining themselves and looking for celebrities, that they hardly have time to wait on you
The food was not bad, but you may have to wait awhile to order
Ive definitely crossed this place off my list of places to dine
this place is definately not on a par with many of the other italian restaurants in the city
i would not go back
the food was just so-so
the pasta bolognese was gummy and stuck together and the broccoli-rabe and sausage app was tiny
the service on the other hand was very good
our waiter was attentive and on top of his game
chas
Personally, I feel this place used to be better
In particular, they used to have much better staff
On a recent visit, we found the waiters surly and unknowledgeable
Sometimes the food is good, other times so so and always overpriced for simple, Tuscan trattoria food
I have also witnessed the owner berating staff, which was quite unpleasant
Why have I gone back? I like the pasta with artichokes and the energy there can be fun
But, if you are looking for a memorable Italian meal with great service and a pleasant ambiance, I would go elsewhere
After my last experience, I don't think I'll be back
Just love to read the funny reviews
food bad? service sucked? bathroom smelled? they knock everything about this place
probably because they felt inferior to everyone else there
this place is sooooo much fun! if you dont have a reservation, wait for your table
its very well worth it
no matter if the reviews suck, this place will always be full
why? because all these bad things arent true
Can't say enough about our (My Husband I )LOVE affair for Da Silvano
We've been experiencing this FABULOUS Restaurant since our 1st
date 4 years ago
Romantic, Sexy, definitely Fullfilling in every way! Excellent for a 1st
date on the weekend, and it's even better during the week
The staff Silvano are EXTREMELY accomodating

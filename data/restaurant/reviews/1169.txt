The food was fabulous (especially the chicken and steak), as was the wine
One complaint - although the staff was very attentive at the beginning of the meal and when we were ordering, there was a *long* wait between appetizer and entree - I'd say 45 minutes
My girlfriend and I visited while in NYC and we were very impressed
We started with the mussels and moved on to the duck and chicken meals
The cocktails were excellent, and the wine even better (I wish I remembered what they reccomended, but it was superb) The three cheese plate came next, and the blueberry cheesecake finished
I can't speak highly enough of that cheesecake! Overall I'd say it's worth the money
I recently had my reception here, It was wonderful
All my guest were raving about the food, how great the staff are and the ambiance
The dessert was excellent! Definitely returning
This place has amazing food and even better service
It's graceful and fancy without being stuffy
Try the desserts!
My fiance and I stumbled upon Tempo, while walking along Fifth Avenue
It looked so nice and pleasant inside, we decided to give it a try
We were seated promptly
Our server, Zach, was outstanding, providing excellent wine and menu choices
Even the young lady who was pouring our water was very knowledgeable of the menu
We ordered the farro salad to share, then moved on to the papparadelle with wild board to share
For our main courses, my fiance had the Loup de Mer (which replaced the snapper that night) and I had the whole Orata, both excellent
We then each ordered dessert: almond flan and a toffee pudding, both wonderful
But the cheesees intriqued me, so we also had a nice selection of three cheese
For the quality of the food and the level of service, the price is very reasonable
I have been to all the best in Manhattan and Brooklyn and can say without a doubt that this is my new favorite place
From the atmosphere to the food, everything was perfect
A new level of dining for Brooklyn
And they have only been open for 3 weeks! Expect big things from TEMPO
In Short Legendary chocolatiere Torres has had such success in DUMBO, he's expanded to this 8,000-square-foot space in Soho
Enormous windows allow passersby to see every step of the chocolate-making process; once inside, a cozy chocolate brown color scheme surrounds shoppers picking up truffles, chocolate bars, hot chocolate mixes and much more
A petite cafe caters to those who prefer to linger over rich hot chocolate and fresh-baked French pastries
I had a little hard time finding the shop, but it was worth walking and looking for
The hot chocolate is a must-have, and I never can forget the first sip
It's just so rich creamy that thinking about it makes me wanna fly to NYC
I was on vacation and staying in NY only for a week so unfortunately didn't have a chance to buy a beautiful pieces of chocolate, but the hot chocolate (both regular and wicked) definitely tasted like a heaven
Creamy, smooth, perfectly flavored, simple, clean, fresh--everything you want chocolate to taste like
gorgeous space
fabulous ambience
lots of things to do: browse the extraordinary selection of packaged and per piece chocolates, watch the chocolates being made (it is a large factory AND bakery), view educational videos about the making of chocolates and -- of course -- EAT CHOCOLATE
lovely bar to buy fresh pastries and various chocolate drinks
the hot chocolate is legendary and DEFIES description (it is THAT good!)
also not to be missed the giant chocolate chip cookie and the mudslide cookies
both have loyal followers
and both deserve it
If you love chocolate, this is your place
The smell alone is wonderful when you walk in
I believe anything you could cover in chocolate they have thought of it
The iced hot chocolate bar is great
The best chocolate place in the city
Ideal for a first getting to know you date where you can sip on the deliciously wicked hot chocolate and indulge in a mudslide cookie
Definitely recommended!
The Scene The Syracuse-based barbecue phenomenon plunked a sprawling roadhouse with all the familiar back-road accoutrements into an abandoned meat factory
Unfinished wood-beamed ceiling, burlap bag curtains, scattered country bric-a-brac, and an enthusiastic greeting feel worlds away from the city
The roll call of devotees includes area families, couples on casual dates and groups of Columbia students
The Food Though fried green tomatoes and punchy boiled shrimp start things off right, the smell of smoking meats quickly adjusts the focus
The smokey-sweet pork ribs gently release from the bone and the Texas brisket, a touch dry, gets a lift from a topping of tangy cured jalepenos and a dash of hot sauce
It's even safe to venture from red meat with the truly moist and tender chicken, brined then smoked for deep flavor
With the exception of the cakey corn bread, sides keep pace, with tangy Creole potato salad and sweetened baked beans the standouts
As the other reviewers have stated, the wait is long, even with a reservation
We waited an hour
But they make the most fantastic peach long island iced teas that made the wait go by quickly
For an appetizer, my table split the sampler - fried green tomatoes, bbq chicken, shrimp
They were wonderful
It was truly the best fried green tomatoes i have ever eaten
I ordered the Ode to Elgin, but substituted the brisket for pulled pork, got 1/4 rackof ribs and sausage
IT WAS DIVINE
Definitely the best bbq in town
The portions are huge and I get to enjoy some leftovers
Even their side dishes are AMAZING
I had the mac and cheese (def the best i've had, even better than schillers and blue smoke) and the salted potatoes
Pure yummyness
This is definitely the best I've had!! If you are a lover of all things bbq, this is a must do!!
This is the BEST barbecue in New York City
Forget Blue Smoke - we had a group of 5 and with one sampler, five entrees, and 1 pitcher of beer, the total was just over $100
Yes, the wait is long, but go with friends and get some drinks - you won't regret the wait
Our waitress was adorable; no attitude here, just good food, good beer and a good time
I'll start with the cons - the wait is ridiculous and the wait staff is not always the most pleasant
With a reservation, I waited one hour and twenty minutes
I'm SOOOOOO glad I waited
This food is unbelievable
Their wings are out-of-this-world
I ate with a couple of friends and not one person could speak for fear of allowing the food to escape
Everyone ordered different things and were more than satisfied
Love it! As a connoiseur of barbecue -- I've eaten at the best places in the South -- this is the best it can possibly get in New York City
The wait staff is decent at worst, but 9 out of 10 times they're quick, polite and eager to please
The hostesses are on top of their game, making sure folks are seated quickly and in order and even letting you glance at a menu as you wait
NOW ONTO THE BARBECUE! Simply put: It's awesome
From the pulled pork sandwiches to the baby back ribs smothered in tangy sauce, you'll have a hard time deciding what to stuff in your mouth
They make the most delicious fried green tomatoes
And, if you're watching your waist, have the iceberg wedge with blue cheese as a side
Wash it down with a cheap flight of draft beer or their yummy sweet tea
NOTE: If you like BLT's, try their ultimate, which has a thick stack of bacon layered under two huge, golden fried tomatoes
Here's the deal: From Syracuse originally and grew up on Dinosaur so, of course, there's a soft spot in my heart for the Harlem location as well
It's true, you probably won't find better BBQ comfort food with a gourmet kick anywhere else in the city, but having frequented the original for many years, I feel the true, gritty character of the joint can only be experienced by eating at the original
However, the ribs are perfectly basted w/ Dino's signature sauce and slow cooked so they fall off the bone--delcious
Pulled pork also amazing
Brisket starts dry but is great when covered with or dipped in sauce
New BLT w/ Fried Green Tomatoes is an excellent lunch option, as is the Diablo Burger
Must have side is the Salt Potatoes--widely unknown by non-upstaters, but dip the little boilers in the cajun drawn butter and you'll fall in love
Just go eat here is the take home message
Try one of the sampler entrees to get a taste of everything, start out with wings and/or drunken shrimp too
You will not be disappointed

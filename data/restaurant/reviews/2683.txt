I recommend checking this place out on a weekday or Sunday -- on Saturday things get very hectic and the rush won't give you the full experience!
I was looking forward to eating here after all the hype, but it was awful
The waitress was extremely rude
When 10 minutes had passed, and we still hadn't received menus, I went and asked her for one
She said they don't use them
They'd make whatever I wanted! But whatever I asked for, they couldn't do
She finally told me they had swordfish kebabs, PERIOD
Then, she brought bread to the tables around us, but not ours
When I asked her why, she looked at us and said we didn't need to eat bread
I wanted to deck her
Well, we never received our salads either, the food came 40 min
later, and it was dry, cold, charred and sucked
I will NEVER eat there again, or recommend it to anyone unless I can't stand them
Don't go by the ambiance, or wait staff (this is Queens for crying out loud)
The food is excellent
You're going there for the food!!! The best moussaka and beef gyros (be sure to order extra tzanziki sauce)
Thin crust pita pizza's a really popular as well
Also, their half lemon chicken is to die for - juciest white meat imaginable
Try the a caral of their house wine to compliment the cuisine
I have been going to Pinocchio's for quiet some time now (about 2 years) and have always been happy with the food
The servie here is terrible - and I've only gotten take out from them
I've ordered the exact same dishes on different days and they've never come the same way twice
But the service is the real problem as the staff always seems bothered that you are there if you're not speaking Greek
Don't waste your time
Laid-back mexican
Not too fancy, but not fast food
Nice mexican music
Friendly waitress
Excellent Alculpuco Chicken dish! Great prices!
these guys make fantastic european style pizza
thin, crispy crust, not overloaded with cheese, and not heavily sauced
delicious!
Wineturtle loves the new look,but best of all the food has remained the same(or BETTER)
The braised meat dishes all have that deep satisfing taste that tells no shortcuts taken
The expanded wine list showes value at the mid range an some value at the BIG BUCKS end
The Old School waiters know their stuff
they can steer you to a wonderful time trust what they say
Ask your waiter about the glasswine they seem to change them often
Owner Operated always a plus
Lunch timr is good time
Worth the trip
The total dining experience from a to z is spectacular
If you love osso bucco - this is the place
This is by far the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to
They cater to your taste
I like spicy food- my girlfriend likes mild food
We were both more than pleased
They are also very reasonably priced
It's definitely worth a try
This restaurant is steps from my apartment, and my girlfriend and I are regulars
The service is awesome! The atmosphere is fun, with the Bee Gees videos on the televisions
The food is really, really great, better than all of the other thai restaurants in the neighborhood
They are open late, and they are cheap
The lunch specials are one of the best values in Astoria
We love it!
Every time I try Thai at other restaurants, it just doesn't compare to Ubol's
I highly recommend the Spicy Pork in the Garden, the Duck with Basil and the Chicken Panaeng, although everything I've tried is delicious
My husband and I are regulars, simply because the food is authentic and delicious, and the staff are the friendlist you will find
If we move out of Astoria, we will still make the trip to back just to go here
So delicious and authentic Thai food
Staff is so friendly
I love the chicken maseman (I probably spelled that wrong) but every dish i've had there was delicious
Also, I love the fact that they deliver at almost any time of the evening (mush later than most places in Astoria)
This is the best thai food in New York, particularly if you order the Spicy Pork in the Garden and the Crispy Duck
Get the appetizer sampler to start
We love a find!Thai Wine
Plums a hint of Ruby Port a touch of Concord,some muscat,save a sip for dessert the Mango Sticky Rice this is as good a wine/ food match as I've had this year
$20 List  has a Malbec worth the price
Wineturtle let Susy our waitress pick for us
We said at $8-12 entrees just keep bringing them out
about half way thru each dish she asked the things we liked about the dish and as the night moved on the food got closer to our ideal Thai taste
Boi the owner dropped by to say Hello and played a Tape for us shot in Thailand
A Jaw dropper
Go
Its A Good Thing
wow
for a neighborhood that seems to be inundated with a slew of thai restaurants, ubol's remains the best
the food is consistently fantastic and flavorful
when you ask for a dish spicy - look out! i HIGHLY recommend the mock duck for those vegetarians out there
Awesome Thai, you cannot go wrong
It is worth the trip to Astoria, no doubt
This is my favorite restuarant in Astoria
You can't go wrong here
If you don't like what your ordered (which probably will never happen)
Nino will bring you something else
I love this place! You will think that your in the heart of Italy
p
s
try the butternut squash ravioli
YUM!
Girassol is consistently delicious and satisfying, serving mouthwatering meats, rice, and beans among other Brazilian favorites
The fresh crisp salad bar is included with every entree so be sure to try the unusually good potato salad
And with such reasonable prices, it is absolutely worth a visit to this gem of Astoria
Not only can you dine on a huge assortment of skewered meats, but it's all available at an extermely affordable price
Stuff your face silly on rodizio, along with the included salad bar, bread, and rice beans
And best of all, Brazillian soap operas run on the television so you can brush up on your Portuguese
The decor only tops off the charm as the restaurant is adorned with wall to wall sunflower-themed art
The food here is simply amazing! Melt in your mouth gnocci, bible sized wine list, amazing service and a festive atmosphere of all ages
The service was excellent, and i can't say I or anyone in our party had a bad dish, they were all amazing
I'm talking about apps through entry, pasta, wine, coffee and dessert! A rare feat! Simply a must try

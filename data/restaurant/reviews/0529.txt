Not to mention the full bar which can help cure your hangover with a delicious brunch
I had a group of 10, and this place was great
You just gotta get there at the right time on the weekends, cause it gets busy
Everything is homemade and now that dinner is served I'm totally hooked
The fried chicken and Key Lime Meringue pie make life worth living
Not bad for a little humble spot on the lower east side! Rush before the rest of the city figures it out
Great hearty brunch (yummy blueberry pancakes, eggs benedict)
Estimate when you'll get hungry, and get there 30 - 40 minutes before estimated time
there will definitely be at least a 25 minute wait
my mother and i walked into this place with no idea, and had a very nice sunday brunch there
we thought it was another downtown diner, so we were pleasently surprised at the quality of food
It got very crowded when we were about to leave, so id say get there early for brunch
My friends and I were very excited to try a new Pub and their Irish Stew, but it never happened
We made reservations, arrived on time, but when we got there we were told the food may take a while
We figured maybe they were just busy, so we sat down
Then we were advised that the kitchen was closed
They weren't even taking orders for another hour! I can understand a restaurant having a busy day and needing to take a moment to reorganize, but be straight about it! Seeing as we had somewhere to be at a certain time, we left to search for an open kitchen somewhere else
It was our last night in New York City
And, we decided to take a walk and when we came across something that looked good we'd stop
Well, we came across Connolly's Pub
And, thought lets try it
Lets eat something we don't usually have
All I can say is O MY GOD!!! We loved it
Warm and comfortable setting, friendly service, and awesome food
It's been 4 months and I've been craving the sheppards pie
Yum!!
My wife and I and my visiting sister stumbled across Connolly's following mass at St
Patrick's and we still can't believe our luck
If you go another day without trying their fantastic Bangers Mash, you should be ashamed of yourself
Their Irish Stew is also splendid
And don't forget the friendly service
Located in the Times Sqaure district, Connolly's provides three floors of classic Irish-American, brass and mahogany pub atmosphere
The Irish staff is attentive and friendly
The menu offers continental and traditional Irish favourites, including an extensive drink selection
Check in certain Saturday nights for Black 47 performing live on the third floor
Highly recommended
My boyfriend and I stopped at Connolly's for dinner after work on a Friday
the Irish staff was welcoming and friendly and the food was authentic and delicious
There was a lively happy hour crowd, but somehow, the warm, dimly lit ambience still lent itself well to a relaxing, romantic meal
Delicious, thoughtfully prepared food from a well chosen, small menu
I always have a good meal there
The wait staff is efficient and attentive
And the wine list is pretty good, although they used to have more Italian wines (which Im partial to)
Its worth the trip for a casual, but sorta upscale, evening
Good prix-fixe, too
Great find on UWS
We had a work holiday party at Cooke's, with wine education
It was the best holiday party I've ever been to
The food was superb, the atmosphere enchanting, the service was impeccable
The owners are awesome! We loved it so much that we had our wedding dinner there
A day filled of wonderful memories, our guest raved about the venue, service and food
Just wish there was a Cooke's cookbook
Highly recommend
My husband and I were big fans of the restaurant when it first opened
On our past two visits, we have watched the service decline (no one checks to see how your meal is going, no one person serves you twice), the quality of the food decline and the ambience decline (the tables are tightly packed in and it is rushed, hurried service)
When I tried to speak with the owner, she could not have cared less about what I had to say
I would never recommend this place
My wife and I walked-in one Friday night because we had always been intrigued when walking by this place
We were not looking for a romantic meal, but it became one
The restaurant is small, quaint, and quiet
It is very condusive to enjoyable conversation
The food was a nice surprise
My wife order the pre-fix ($18) with an entree of beef medallions (3 large, very tender, and juicy medallions
even though my wife ordered it medium well)
I ordered a filet off the menu
It was also very good and cooked perfectly medium-rare
Being originally from NE, I am often disappointed with steak in NY
But I was impressed C'sC had such flavorful selections
Service was pleasant, helpful, and in no way pushy
The whole dining experience was simply relaxing
It would be a good first date because it is quiet and doesn't appear to be a romantic
Cooke's Corner isn't well known, but the food is delicious
They offer a great prix fixe meal - delicious choices for $18 (three courses)
Even if you go with the regular money, it's a real deal for wonderful food
Always fresh, not too crowded (though the room is small)
Great fish and meat selections
The wine list is impressive and reasonably-priced
If you're looking for a UWS dinner spot for a date or with friends, hurry! Service is professional and efficient, without being rushed
Given the fact that it is populated by foodies, it's surprising that there aren't more places on the Upper W
Side that offer what Cooke's does now: meals that are satisfying, generous, innovative, competently executed and presented, and relatively inexpensive
The Prix Fixe menu offers choices from about five appetizers (mostly generous salads), five entrees (beef, fish or organic chicken, perfectly prepared)and five desserts (including a german chocolate cake: a huge cylinder with fresh schlag, enough for two), all for about $18
Recently I dined at Cosi on Broadway and 76th and was sad to witness small pests on the ground
It was disgusting
While the food was good, it's hard to digest when one sees little creatures emerging from the crevices in the wall
I've eaten at Cosi's for years and it is a good restaurant but they may need to look into pest control
It's an issue
I've been to here twice and i must say I thoroughly enjoy it! The food is simple but delicious, and damn it they make some excellent bread! The s'mores on the dessert menu really makes the place though
the staff is very friendly and have no problems taking pictures
my only complaint? both times i was here, i was seated under the same annoying fan! otherwise, i give this place an enthusiastic thumbs up!
I had the amazing mozzarella, basil and tomato sandwich (one of their combo sandwiches
) My friends had a sandwiches that they constructed themselves from the pick 3 menu
We all agreed that it was the best sandwich that we had ever had (although at approximately $9 for the sandwich, I would have to say that it was a good thing that it was
) I would definitely go again
Cosi has great coffee- much better than Starbucks
Also, most of their locations have good service
On top of that, they have great sandwiches and other food, as opposed to Starbucks limited amount of croissants and cakes
The atmosphere is comfortable, they serve alcoholic beverages after 5:00, and while they don't have as many locations as Starbucks, they have plenty of locations all over the city
Great place for any healthy, organic eaters
Where else can you go to get some wholesome, organic tacos and burritoes? The juices here are super fresh
Go for happy hour for one the city's best happy hour deals

We waited about fourty minutes, but it beats those places that you want to try but can never get a reservation
Dinner for two with a bottle of wine for only $68? It is really busy though, so try to get there early
I gave the hostess my name and was told 20min
She asked for my cellphone#
I told her I would be sitting at the bar 5ft
away
She said she would come and get me
35min later, I look at my phone
There's a message from the restaurant
They never checked the bar and gave away the table
15min
later we're seated
We order a bottle of wine and drink 1glass each
No one came back with the rest of the bottle
By the time someone came, our meals were finished
What happened to our wine? Why wasn't the rest of the bottle brought during our meal? The waiter said it was finished
After 20min of investigation they realized they pored our wine for others
They didn't offer to take the bottle off the bill, instead they opened another bottle and served us chocolatepudding
Who drinks whitewine with chocolatepudding
GROSS
Went here last night for dinner and drinks and ended up staying for 3+ hours
Everything was fabulous, from the food to the service to the music
Just go!
Good food in an ok setting
I can't see what all the hype is about
It's not bad, just doesn't live up to it's provenance(Red Cat, Harrison)
The reasonable prices are what you'd expect to pay at this type of place, but it's not outstanding by any means
This restaurant is great
The food tastes fantastic- very fresh, very nice combinations of flavors
I had a delicious whole duraude on a bed of vinagared greens, and lobster mashed potatoes
It was all excellent
Service was outstanding, we were thanked 7 times as we left the place at the end of our meal
And the decor is casual/elegant, very down-to-earth, but classy
The Mermaid Inn is one of the best restaurants I have been to in a long while
The ambience charming and welcoming, the staff is above and beyond anything you could ever hope for, and the food is in a class by itself
We had the salmon and the skate sandwich, both of which were outrageously delicious
The grand finale is the complimentary pudding that is to die for
Go as soon and as often as you can!
Great new place that really cares about service
We went on Monday night after trying to get in on Sat where there was a 2 hr wait
Not only did they recognize us, but they also gave us a round of drinks at the bar for having to wait 25 minutes more than they originally said
Try the clam fritters - excellent while waiting at the bar for a table
Food came out really fast and was delicious (try the scallops) and the side of mashed potatoes was some of the best I have had in the city
The menu is somewhat limited for entrees, but will improve when they start adding specials
Several staff members came and asked how we were doing, thanked us for waiting and said that they would shortly be opening up another room/garden
A great new place for seafood in the E
Village without attitude
we got the food delivered
being indian myself, i know what to look for in an indian restaurant
the food was really good
the chicken tikka masala was excellent, along with the chana masala and aloo gobi
the naans and onion kulcha were top notch
everything had a very good flavor, and the level of spiciness can be altered (from mild, medium, spicy)
a tad less oil and smaller vegetable and meat pieces in the curries were the only things i would improve
but these are hardly any reasons not to visit this restaurant
the food definitely tasted authentic
The food here was terrible both times I ordered
Unappetizing curries, dry meats, and inflated prices are what awaits at this dumpy place under the BQE
This continues the trend of bad Indian food restaraunts in Williamsburg (someone save us, please!)
This chain of fast-food style sandwich shops uses fresh ingredients to produce very good salads, cakes and, of course, sandwiches
Inexpensive - and sometimes a bit soggy, a good alternative to the burger joint
Pret is a really great lunch spot
The food is organic, and the choices seem really great
I found the eli's banana cake to be disgusting
it was incredibly oily, it felt like i was eating an oily sponge
and the frosting was worse
it wasn't made of cream cheese like the carrot, it was butter and just too oily
Check the website for fat content, what may seem low fat is actually not
Other than that terrific food, and the staff is super nice
The soups are a must to try
The Pret I know and love is on Madison and 41st, but I'll bet that this one is equally wonderful
The sandwiches ($4
50-$5
95) are delicious and packed with flavors you would not normally expect -- onion chutney, pine nuts, etc
Many come on whole grain breads and all are clearly made with utmost care
The distinctive triangular-shaped boxes hold the sandwiches snugly, and by some miracle, they are never soggy
There are numerous vegetarian selections, as well as salads with fresh mozz or goat cheese on top
Gazpacho is also excellent
And don't forget a freshly baked cookie!
Best bagels around, hands down
Beats Essa, HH, Murrays, all the best mahanttan bagel joints
There sesame bagel is perfection, I have never had better
For people complaining about the service: It's a bagel shop! What do you expect? You get in line, wait for a free clerk, and then order your bagel and pay! I have never been to a bagel store that has done their service differently
All of the clerks are overly polite and nice to me, but in a laid back manner which is nice
Most importantly, they all seem very happy to be working there, which makes a world of difference in terms of good service!
There's a great variety of bagels here with an excellent crisp outside and chewy inside
This store also has a great selection of cream cheeses and non-dairy cream cheese alternatives
There are deli items and cookies as well, but I just can't tear myself away from the bagels! The one suggestion I would make is that this place vary their pastries and desserts a little more
The bagels aren't worth suffering through the convoluted ordering system
They often run out of menu items, and suggest ridiculous alternatives
Staff can be outright rude
The Scene A crowd this mixed--local workers, lounging artists and adventuresome city folk--usually signals one of two things: the only restaurant around, or a reasonably priced diner that serves darned good food
Hope dessert case stocked with homemade sweets hint at another hip "New Diner," but it's a friendly staffed neighborhood joint at heart
The Food  This wide-ranging American menu is less ironic, and more satisfying, than the retro-stylized photos under laminate would suggest
Sandwiches, burgers and salads, like the lemon-dressed cobb, are classic successes
Entrees are more ambitious: Crackly skinned, herb-roasted chicken atop chunky mashed potatoes and greens cries for gravy, but beautifully grilled pork loin is sublime
Sweet-tart lemon butter offsets salty, ham-wrapped tuna--just ask for it rare
I ate there this morning with my mother and 2 year old daughter and we all had a great time
We had the open face meatloaf sandwich which was incredible! The chocolate chip pancakes - fantastic! - and a really good omelette
And it was all very affordable

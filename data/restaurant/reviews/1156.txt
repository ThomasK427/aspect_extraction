Service was poor
Dont waste your time with this place unless you feel like getting ripped off!!
Ambiance was great, very romantic
Went at 9:30pm on a Monday with a friend, restaurant was mostly packed
We had a table in the back, which seemed nice, until we were all but forgotten about by our server
Seemed to be many problems just getting our appetizers out (guacamole, which was delicious when it finally came) and we were there an hour before entrees arrived
Though by entrees I mean tiny, minuscule, barely visible portions of food
Three bite size (no joke) quesadillas for $10? Yeah, THAT sounds reasonable
Drinks were good, but we only had one each
Could've used more, since we were both fuming with anger when we left
A restaurant that requires you grab pizza on the way home
Good drinks and a nice ambiance, but that's about it
It seems like a great value, with dishes arond $10, until you discover each dish consists of miniscule portions
There were three in our party and we ordered three dishes, all of which were tasty, but the total sum of food we received wasn't even enough to feed one of us
A guy I met on the bathroom line said he and his girlfriend had enough to eat, but upon further inquiry he admitted it was because he ordered 5 dishes for the two of them
We were still hungry after our meal and ended up going for more food later
Unless your idea of a meal is a bite sized taco, or you're on a date with the guy from the bathroom line, don't bother
Mercadito manages to be extremely creative in it's food preparation yet stay true to it's Mexican roots
Even if the service is sub-par, the quality and taste of the food far outweighs the inadequate service
We sat in the back room for dinner- we ordered 4 orders of tacos and asked if this was enough for 4 people and the waitress said yes
Then the food came- TINY portions and plates came out in 15 min intervals
The margharitas are apparently made fresh but in one instance a refill took 30 min
While the food was good, the bad service completes outweighs any memory of how good it tasted
The minute a plate is empty, it is instanteously cleared from the table in an effort to rush you out of the restaurant
AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS
Mercadito has a great back seating area
I would recommend it for a date
The tacos are delicious
They come 3 to a plate but they are mini
Just know in advance to order a couple of different items, including sides! The side of rice and beans are a bit overly spiced
The service was nice, although our food took longer than usual to arrive because it had been brought to the wrong table and accidently eaten
I had the mango margarita- it was ok
There were so many pieces of mango it was difficult to drink
Overall, food and atmosphere is good
Cons: I wouldn't say it is the best best value
After our party of 3 ordered the sampler guacomole appetizer, 3 orders of tacos + 2 sides, we still felt hungry
Even so, I would still recommend it to a friend and I would still go back
The atmosphere was quite nice, and that the waitstaff were polite and professional
But I feel we were decieved about the cost of the meal
The menu seems reasonable considering nothing is over $10
They don't tell you that not only do you need many courses of these tiny tacos (with No side items), but they increase the price of each plate based on the size of your party
So our party of 6 had about 5 shared taco plates, drinks, and deserts for about $60 apiece
That would have been fine if the food was delicious or even filling
Every taco tasted the same, as if they threw so many ingrediants into each that all the flavors were mudied together as to be rendered neutral
The bottom line is that Mercadito is All style and No substance (the drinks had far too much salad and seasoning in them
) F+
Party of 6 New Years Eve
Have been to Mercadito several times previous and agree the food is excellent at a good value
However, the service has SIGNIFICANTLY declined since they expanded into the back room
Our New Years reservation was 1/2 hour late without any apology whatsoever
Our waitress was awful: forgot items, brought the wrong drinks/food, and failed to offer dessert
I understand that the food is brought out as its made, but she would bring three tacos (for a table of six) about every ten minutes
Unacceptable
I will try Mercadito again, but if the service does not improve, I recommend going eslewhere
UPDATE: Have been back several times and although the pace of the meal could be improved, all things considered, its a great place
Ole
The food was excellent, however don't even dare to show up late if you don't want the owner to get antsy although the restaurant is still completely empty
Also, better stick to his suggestions how to order (amount of food, the order of the dishes) as your own input will be ignored anyway
And finally, make sure you leave the minute your fork hits the table again - there is a line of (invisible?) people waiting outside for your table and the staff will remind you of that 2-3 times in less than a minute
Next time: take out!
Went with 5 friends for NYE dinner before a party!! What a pleasure, the table was a little tight for 5 on a 4 top, but the Unbelievable Margarita's (Pepino Rocks
), Fast Service, and 1st Rate food made up for the space
Waitstaff was helpful and in following with their recomendations we shared 6-8 dishes and everything was spectacular
Ceviches, and Tacos, and Baked Oysters were especially noteworthy
Can't wait to get back there this week when I'm not pressed for time
The mexican fare at this tiny place is clever and tasty
The drink menu is equally interesting and the margaritas are very well done
But, there is definitely a problem with their order delivery system
We were brought some other tables' food no less than three times
It certainly did not ruin our dining experience
However, it was definitely confusing and a little irritating to continually tell the various servers that we didn't order what they were trying to put down on our table, and to reiterate what we were waiting for again and again
This would be a great place if they could just figure out which food belongs to whom
the food is ok
the staff is horrific
After very nice meal and drinks, the manager had the audacity to come up to come up to me while my finace was in the restroom and ask me if I could go to the bar so he could seat another couple at my table
After I told him we were leaving and to relax, he blew up in a violent tirade
There were quite a few people waiting for tables, but it was not my fiance's fault that she had to wait 15 minutes in line to use the ONLY bathroom in the annoyingly tiny restaurant
There is a level of professionalism that is exepcted from any establishment towards its patrons and this place defintely lacks it
I will never return and will never recommend this place to anyone
Stopped by last Sunday night
The place was empty, but they still insisted on trying to squeeze our table of 3 into a 2-top table
It's our policy they said
They wanted one of us to sit on a child's chair
All while over half of the restaurant was over
They watched us walk out rather than try to accommodate us
I'd really wanted to try the place and have heard good things about it
Oh well
Very small charming restaurant with very good to excellent Mexican food
Great for a casual dinner in the East Village
Friendly warm service and cozy atmosphere
My family doesn't eat prok for religous reasons and they accidentally served us someone else's pork tacos
They didn't mention what it was when they put it down and we ate it
They felt so bad they bought us dinner and appologized profusely
The chef even came out to say he was sorry
A wondeful, warm place with fantastic, authentic mexican food
Besides being a delicious adorable restaurant
they are very kind
They accidentally brought us the wrong dish, a normal mistake which happens all the time- but they are so focused on making the customer happy that they went out of their way to ensure the rest of the meal was perfect
This is my new favorite restaurant
It is my pleasure to eat there

Our evening at Shaffer's was not only highlighted by the creative fish dishes and the wonderful, personalized service but also by meeting Jay Shaffer and having a great conversation with him
The oysters were fresh
The fish dishes were prepared to perfection
we would highly, highly recommend an evening at Shaffer's
I went there for dinner on 9/8/2005 with a friend
The staff was very friendly and helpful
The raw oysters were so fresh and delicious and our entrees were excellent
Excellent service, great selection of freash Oysters and wine
Great service with a smile! Next time we'll go back for dinner
On every occasion that I have visited Shaffer City, I have been delighted by the menu, drinks and particularly by the specials
It goes without saying that the oyster selection is huge and impressive, not to mention surprising
I am astonished to report also that their staff, always pleasant and knowledgeable, continues to grow and improve, so much so that on my last visit, by our third round of oysters, we simply asked that our server bring us 3 dozen of what he thought best
We were not disappointed
I am absolutely amazed that this place is as unknown as it is
Their selection of oysters is vast -- maybe 30 varieties? -- and their staff is incredibly well versed and experienced with the choices
I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT -- My boyfriend and I go every time we're in the mood for oysters
Probably not the most romantic spot, but with the low ceilings and soft lighting it can make for a marvelous date
Just dont tell TOO many of your friends -- I love that I can always get a last-minute rezzy
I was pleasantly surprised by this place, not knowing what to expect after reading some of the reviews
We went on a tuesday evening so it wasn't too crowded
The place was nice, the waitress was very attentive, and the food was excellent, and just the right portion
Even the bathroom was nice (that's very important)! The owner even greeted us at the door
It was a bit pricey, but worth it
I'd definitely go back
Previous diner's letter was way off base
I was having dinner two tables from them
The place was packed and there were people enjoying their meals on every table
Those five people had spent over 2 and a half hours enjoying themselves and were just hanging out talking after finishing their coffees
The place was packed and people were waiting for tables
I over heard Mr
Shaffer and he was quit polite in requesting the party to leave because he had another party waiting and they were just ignoring the situtation
They were wrong and this place is so Right
I've been dining with Shaffer City for years and to this date is still one of the most wonderful dinning experiences anywhere
The seafood was above average, with the service a little on the slow side
We were enjoying the evening until the end of dinner
We waited for the slow waiter to present the check, and shortly after, we were approached by the owner/chef (Shaffer)
I assumed (wrongly), that he was coming out to thank us
Especially after we ordered appetizers, multiple bottles of wine, and a full dinner
Shaffer instead said that he had people waiting at the bar, and we needed to leave
This was insulting, especially after spending close to $400 on dinner
Shaffer turned five happy customers into people who will tell all our friends to avoid this place
and all so that he could save 10 minutes
There are SO MANY better places in NY for seafood
Try AquaGrill, Blue Water Grill, Roys, Atlantic Grill, or Mesa Grill for much better seafood in a nicer atmosphere
I've been to Shaffer City about a half dozen times so far
Food is always excellent -- very fresh and prepared with imagination
Nice wine list -- including half price glasses of wine during happy hour in the bar (one of the best bargains in NYC)
I have always found the owner/chef to be very helpful in recommending dishes and providing good service
(My guess is that the complaints about the owner are all written by the same person under different screen names -- they sound unusually similar in writing style
) On my first two visits, I received a complimetary tasting appetizer from the chef
Service can be spotty in the restuarant, but is more often good than not
Shaffer City is a great place for seafood lovers
The setting is very casual, the room looks like it could be in Maine or in Brittany
The seafood platter offers the freshest oysters, clams, shrimps and a light, tasty coleslaw
The service is a bit chaotic, but this is a casual restaurant, so it doesn't really matter
Our main course was a delicious sauted scallop on a potato puree that had the perfect amount of truffle oil, just enough to flavor, but not take over the dish
The sweet scallops were so good, so fresh
The wine list is fine, we had a Muscadet Sur Lie which was the perfect companion to oysters
We skipped dessert, they didn't seem so appealing
Granted, the plates aren't the best in the world, but the oysters are DELICIOUS every single time I go
I really like the oyster menu and the descriptions they have of every single oyster they offer
They have the TASTIEST and FRESHEST oysters in the city by far
If you're an oyster fan, you definitely have to go to Shaffer City
I don't know who this jerk is who has a bone to pick with the owner, but the food at Shaffer City is great
I had no complaints with the service, and most patrons seemed to genuinely enjoy the host's banter
If anyone was annoyed by him, it didn't happen when I went
The decor is nice enough, while not elegant, it was comfortable and interesting if nothing else
The smokey front bar was far enough away (like, 50 feet away) from the non-smoking section as to have no effect on dinner
Don't listen to this loser who is posting such ridiculously negative comments, or you'll miss some delicious seafood
My boyfriend took me there for my birthday
The food (especially the oysters) was wonderful
The waiter was very nice and funny
The owner was very friendly
Will definitely go back there next time I am in mood for good seafood and raw bar
For me, it's not about the oysters as the name might suggest, but the amazing fish dishes! The salmon tartare, shrimp dumplings and crab cakes stand out among the appetizers
The striped bass and the snapper are excellent, and I have never gone wrong with a nightly special
For dessert, try the chocolate molten cake with a glass of port
wow! To find exceptional cuisine in a restaurant that accommodates kids (with crayons, specially prepared dishes and a friendly attitude) makes it extra special
These last few critics obviously have it out for this great restaurant, but you can tell that the overall response is very positive
There is always a great and slightly different variety of dishes, and the wine selection is extensive
The only possible improvement would be the decor, which isn't the classiest, but once your food comes you won't even notice
I take my mom here
I take my girlfriends here
the City NEVER fails (ok, they couldn't quite handle last valentine's day
)
Something like 40 fresh oysters, and every dish is a good bet
Owner is always there, often in the kitchen; guarantee Jay will talk to you
I want to keep this place my own secret, but what the hell
he's built a great little place
The oysters were fresh and delicious! So many selections, so little time! I had a fabulous time there and the service was great! The tuna was grilled to perfection and the lobster pasta was perfect! You should definitely check it out!!!
Went to Shaffer's the other evening with my wife and was amazed to see the selection of oysters
Wow and all of them so fresh
We go to Aqua Grill and Grand Central all the time but this place blew them both away
I've never seen such a large selection in my life
The room was so charming, the service so unobstrusive and the food so great that you had to feel good upon leaving knowing you would soon be back for Brunch on Saturday
Way to go
I read the rating and comments on CitySearch webpage before I went for the first time
It was just simply fantastic
The food and service both were superb! You definitely have to try the oysters and the twin tartars
I only wish they would have more choices in the Big Dish section besides fish

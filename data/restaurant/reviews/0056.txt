I told all my friends not to go
Personally, I will never go back
I went there for a dinner conference
When I walked in, no one paid any attention to me for a good 10 minutes
When I asked for my guest, the manager said he did not know anyone with the name and told me to look around while the waiter kept hitting the reservation book with a spoon behind me
The manager finally looked at the book and told me that I was the first one to show up
Unbelivable
Went there last night for 2 year anniversery, and wasn't all that impressed
For the quality of food, a little too expensive
You are paying for the atmosphere, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge
The only positive was the wait staff, which was prompt, knowledgable, and likeable
If you want to save some money, don't go here
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there
The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated
Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive
The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd, but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent! Me and my girls will definitely go back
Areo is a great restaurant
Have been there several times and haven't been disappointed
The halibut is wonderful and so are the lamb chops
The fried fresh mozz
appetizer is also wonderful
I look forward to the next visit
The only negative thing I could say about this restaurant is the noise level
Got in on a Friday night at 7:30 no problem
Cold Antipasto was horrible
($10)Nothing but a pile of mushy eggplant and yellow squash and paper thin sliced meats, no rstd peppers, no sun-dried tomatoes, no fresh mozz
, etc
Fillet mignon good but nothing special
Ravioli, nothing to write home about
Pumpkin cheesecake was the worst($8)
It was like pudding, not firm like it should be
The place is way too expensive for what you get and I felt cheated
Areo's is by far the most amazing restaurant in Bay Ridge
I personally know the owner, and he is the friendliest most outgoing restaurant owner I know
Areo's is all about personal service and every server is professional and the service is absolutely amazing
The food is un-matched quality
If you are looking for real italian food in the perfect atmosphere, this is the place to go, and worth the wait
Areo is one of the best Italian restaurants in Bay Ridge
The Filet Mignon is awesome, along with everything else on the menu
My only complaint is that the place is over crowded on weekends, but that's the price you pay for having such great food
I highly recommend!
The cars parked out front says it all - this place is about good looks and good food
Get dressed for this one - if you want to be wined and dined - you must look the part
all you SOHO types will love this place - just as much as I do
Areos brings a new class of character to Bay Ridge - I have seen numerous celebs (Billy Baldwin, LL Cool J) dining there
The best part
the food is truly magnificent and the desserts are out of this world
My husband and I love the hershey's kiss (as we call it) - an angel hair pasta shrimp plate served piping hot in aluminum foil - just like a big KISS
Molto bene!!!  Smooches to the chef and the staff!!! ;-)
We had every stop of our trip to NY planned, except for a late night meal when we arrived
The restaurant is open 24 hours, so at 1:00 a
m
we tried it
(It was only a few steps from our hotel (Dream)
While the service and setting were average, the food was excellent
We are foodies, so by taste alone, the food was a real 10
Try the Mediterranean platter, which beats any of the nearby Greek places
Even the Croque Monsoir (grilled ham and cheese) was out of this world
The crepes are also highly recommended
No kidding, but his was the only place during the trip where we ate twice
We were there March 7 and found Maison very nice
The food was good, the service prompt, and the price very reasonable
In better weather it would be even better
I made reservations for Valentine's Day 2 weeks in advance
I got there 15 minutes before our reservation time and guess what? They were closed! That's right! Apparently they're undergoing renovations
Unfortunately no one told me that while I was making reservations
They had my last name and telepone number and they didn't even bother to call!!! What kind of establishment would do that? I won't even think twice about trying to go there
When they open again I will make sure the manager gets an earfull
Was in town for business, staying in midtown
All-night restaurant with excellent burgers and stella on tap
Great food, great experience!
I stopped by for dinner at this place because it was close to a show I was going to see nearby
The restaurant was definitely a pleasant surprise
I can't comment much on the decor, it was lush and they had these old style, yet modern fans hanging from the ceilings
The food however, is worth mentioning
The mediterranean tapas were delicious, and the morrocan tuna with mashed potatoes with pepercorn crusted tuna was mouth watering
A definite GO
Friendly service, great outdoor seating, nice selection of french food at ANY TIME OF THE DAY
Nice people watching too
The Scene This storefront eatery is decked with colorful Mexican art and party kitsch, but it gets dim and moody enough in the evenings to suit a date
The cleanliness of the small open kitchen and its appetizing fresh-ingredient displays encourage the appetite
The menu is large and sometimes confusing; the service informal but polite
The Food Surprisingly tasty Texas-style barbecue gives this place culinary flexibility beyond that of most wrap-and-burrito shacks
The sweetness of succulent barbecued pork and thick salsa cruda counterpoint a salty and garlicky fresh guacamole
The taco salad is impaired by a thick, tasteless tomato-tortilla shell, but the homemade chili (best with hickory-smoked chicken) is hearty, perfectly spiced and darn good
For dessert, go with the delicate, subtle flan over the pasty rice pudding
The largest burritos and qusedillas that I have seen in a LONG time
They have great happy hour specials that include $4
50 sangrias and $3
50 mojitos
A good watering hole kind of place, stop by after work for some good, cheap drinks
Fantastic food
Especially the BBQ chicken burritos! Portions are big and filling
Delivery is fast
I order lunch from here once a week
I should first start off by saying that I've actually never walked into a Blockhead's Burritos restaurant, but my boyfriend and I love ordering it on seamless web
It specializes in Mexican/Cuban food so it's not like your typical burritos, tacos, etc
I love the wraps because they use this Mexican ranch dressing
I liked the Kaluha flan too

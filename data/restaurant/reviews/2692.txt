be prepared to spend at least $70 on dinner, if you are drinking wine, much more
overall, a great place for a dinner date
if the weather is nice, there is a lovely patio that wraps around the restaurant
I really like the place
veryyyy romantic! Candle lit and surrounded by beautiful greenary
Everything on the menu looked good
lots of variety
I especially loved the dips, the fish and the greek wine! And the service was amazing
felt like a queen :-)   I'd definately go there again
I felt very comfortable and pampered!
This restaurant is good if you want to try a large variety of traditional Greek food
The atmosphere is very nice and traditional Greek
However it is quite expensive and they don't show the prices outside (for main dishes over 20 dollars)
The food here is so authentic, and the meals just feel light and tasty
One thing I highly recommend is to order a dessert (specifically the athenian creme cake)
It is absolutely one of the best desserts I have had in a long time
We live around the corner from Sagapo and never stopped by until tonight- more than pleasantly surprised! the specials were excellent, everything was delicious down to the olive oil they serve when you sit down
the seafood, horiatiki and tzatziki was ausome
service was great too! only drawback is that space is a bit tight at some tables, but all in all a great place to eat that we will be back to many more times!
The food at S'Agapo is excellent and could well change your opinion of Greek food
I'm a vegetarian and found plenty to eat; spreads, veggies, salads, beans, moussaka
You can tell care is taken to make the dishes look and taste good; this is no half-assed Greek place
I'm definitely going back and dragging friends so we can order lots of different dishes and share them all!
This is not just a 'diner'; Pat and Archie make this a family occasion! The waiters are the best and the food is absolutely great!!! I had a holiday party catered recently; the manager took special care in helping me create the menu, and when the food arrived at my house, it was not only great, the portions were more than generous!!! You are in for a special treat to eat at this family establishment!
I've had hamburgers in many places in New York, but there is nothing better than a Bel-Aire burger
The burger is flame-broiled as it should be for that great taste, and the bun is toasted so it doesn't get soggy
Whenever I have a less than good day, I go to Bel-Aire, have a bacon-cheeseburger, or bacon-burger deluxe, and everything's good again
This diner has been rated Best in the CITY, by the Daily News
The crown used to belong to the Neptune Diner on 31st and Astoria, but no longer
The staff is attentive and fun
The food is good
It passes the drunken cheeseburger test with flying colors
Always clean and welcoming
They deliver around the area
It might not be right off the Grand Central, but it's way worth it
It's where all the cops go, which should tell you something
I love this place
The staff is always extremely friendly when I stop in for takeout on my way home from work
The atmosphere is nice and quiet
Definitely a must for any Astoria dweller!
Poor service
Maybe the waitress had a bad day (but all three on the two different occasions? Come on) Extremely unfriendly and SLOW service
Sushi chef is a-okay, but he's not the guy taking your order and bring you the food
They may be the only authentic Japanese restaurant in Astoria / LIC, but I would rather eat at the JJ's for excellent sushi
Heck I may just go to the next door (Family Market), and buy a take-out sushi instead
NOT recommended at all
I went to Shima after a friend recommended it to me
For under $20 I got the tempura lunch special and my bf got the salmon teriyaki
They each included salad, miso soup, a california roll, and a whole plate of food
It was all delicious and I couldn't believe the amount of food for $8
95
I will definitely be going back
The service was kind of slow, but they were always polite and helpful
As long as you're not in a rush, you should try this place out!
This place is just kinda lame
The fish could definitely be fresher (even the roe had a glazed appearance and very fishy flavor)
The service blew
Not impressed
We will continue leaving Astoria for Ariyoshi in Sunnyside
Recommend the same to others
When I order a roll with flying fish roe, and it costs me $2
50 extra, I expect it to be rolled all the way around not just on 10% of it
When I asked for it to be rerolled I was told that it would be done the same way
Isn't there some unwritten rule that Sushi chefs take pride in their creations, is it art or is it just another way to fleece the customer
No, there are no other choices in Astoria for sit down, semi casual Japanese dining, and therefore I went to Shima
A few times at the bar I felt as though the Sushi chef an older gentleman was laughing at me and my girlfriend
Long story short, not on my dollar and hopefully not on yours
For all the positive reviews it only takes one bad one to spoil a name
Yeah, ignore that bozo who gave Shima a bad review
probably the competition, or something
My wife and I have eaten at BShima/B about ten times since we moved to Astoria, and the food has always been great
Not as good as Tomoe in the Village, but what is? This is a nice cozy restaurant that serves up fresh sushi with very friendly service
give it a try
Sam
I can get a whole rotisserie chicken for half the price of what half of a chicken costs there
I don't get it
The sides are kinda gross too
Wineturtles only stop for Cuban/Asian
simple quaility
this is the style of cooking that takes normal dishes to new highs
the Won Ton soup in the Qt
size is a meal for two byitself brimming with Roast Pork Chicken Beef Sprouts and such
The live lobster in the tank shows value in lobster dishes and when lobster is an additional ingreadiant its real not that Shrummi Cod stuff,Wineturtle loves the Roast Pork with mushrooms and all the Cubano dishes
It's hard to find a restaurant with the three main ingredients
Quality, quantity and price
This place rates high on all these
Any item I tried on the menu is mouth watering
The decor is Spartan at best, but that is the point
You don't pay for decor
Rather you are paying rock bottom price for a meal that could cost you triple any where else
I especially liked the barbecued meats which are cooked slowly in front of you, and you can ask for a piece right off the spit
All in all this is a place that attracts people of all races, colors and economic status, as I noticed suited clients as well as hippies, or soiled clothed laborers who stop in for a quick good meal or a business lunch or dinner
I will definitely be eating here often
This is one restaurant you have to visit
This place has been around for 25 years and for good reason
The food is excellent from the barbecued lamb at $13
50, to the red snapper at $14
50, or pastitsio at $9
00
Excellent dips, fresh salad and the patrons are mostly repeat customers

The service in house isn't any better
I'm done
Next time I need a thorough nagging, I'll go to my grandparents' house at least eat for free
The food varies wildly in quality from a fantastic dog and fries (the cheese fries are occasionally the best ever and occasionally almost inedible from being doused with salt) to a freezer burnt corn dog that was fried to a shriveled crisp I had to take back three times before screaming at the idiot behind the counter
The service is consistant
Its always bad, arrogant, and slow
I have had great food there, but its been a while
A delicious great bargan (their box lunches are the best deal!) I love the buns which are more like a baguette for your dog than the usual spongy bread
Veggie dogs are great (although Crif Dogs still do them better), but the ultimate are the fries!!! Crispy and seasoned, they are the best
Not bad milk shakes either
Their take on the chicago dog was not convincing
Very messy but not in a good way
I think they should re-examine their buns and go for something a little less fu-fu
They start with good hot dogs (Niman Ranch, available at Eli's), but fail to grill them
The cheese was grated over the dog, not melted
The rolls and condiments were not bad
But I wouldn't make it a point to go around the block for them, much less trek to Brooklyn
Not only a bargain, but high quality at bargain basement prices! I drove from Manhattan to check out what all the hype was and was pleasantly suprised
Everything is freshly made and of top quality
This isn't fast food, it's gourmet dogs and fries! I had the Sparky Dog and with Vermont Cheddar fries
Yum! Great job!
Of all the hamburger and hot dog places, this one is in another league
I love dogs and burgers but Sparky's are truly delicous
Seriously, these are serious dogs - I like the traditional chili dog and the red kraut dog
I've been back for the burger and grilled cheese
worth the trip
For the price the food is amazing quality and looks great
Go
and those that don't can be found at Sparky's American Food! Takes the traditional hot dog to a whole new level (without leveling your bank account!) But don't just come for the dogs
The jalepeno white cheddar cheese fries are especially tasty and the burger's one of the best I've had
Inspired by his owner's Staffordshire terrier, Sparky's namesake, however, remains mysteriously absent
Sparky's fantastic soy dogs get us going there several times a week
Veggie burgers, Great fries, homemade catsup
You really experience the attention Sparky's gives to providing good, healthy food, happy service and a great place to relax
definitely worth dropping in for a bite
probably the best hot dog i've ever had in my life
not sure where they get them from, but it was unique
i had the fries which were freaking great too
oh, and apparently everything they have is available in vegetarian form (soy dogs
etc
) can't vouch for their flavor, but probably worth checking out
I loved everything I had (chili dog, jalapeno cheese fries, coke in a GLASS bottle and chocolate shake)
The hot dog was ridiculous
My friend said to try the dog with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese
He said the burger was good too, but the dog was better
Everything was super cheap
The place is cool inside but it needs stuff on the walls
Kind of plain
Needs color
But food is the most important thing and you got that right
Great place
I will be back
Truly the best dogs and condiments I have ever eaten
Although certainly the price is right, the food is outstanding
Hand-made buns, mustards and relishes from scratch
And the owner's dog is sweet
The atmosphere is middle-ageish BT crowd in a garishly elegant setting, and it kind of looks like it should be one of those big mansion restaurants that are so popular in upper-middle-class NJ
Be prepared to hear bad 70s rock and 80s pop thumping downstairs while you eat, but the food is shockingly good
The fish I had was perfectly cooked and seriously one of the best I've had, even at all the $200/meal restaurants
It's kind of a bizarre setting (though you may really get into the humor of it and the strangely festive vibe), but service is tight, and for $45 prix fixe, it's actually a really good deal
If you're in the area, pop in -- just don't let the not-so-hipsters trying to dance downstairs scare you away
The food was amazing! I recommend this place to everyone I know! Moderatley priced and elegant
Thank You Chef Sandro
I've had diner here dozens of times, and every time is a transporting experience for me
The chicken liver appetizer brings back memories of how mom used to make it
The steak entree on the tobacco menu is simply wonderful
Service is attentive and friendly
Chef Sandro is as entertaining as the food is great
wonderful selection of appetizers- (grilled artichoke is killer!) and the pasta dishes are fantastic
there is this one 'lemon cream' pasta dish- so unique to find something like lemon and parmesean on the same plate! the seafood is also great- tender seabass and maine lobster linguine
a must try
located in a little nook right next to Tao
This restaurant doesn't look exceptional when you first walk in -- the decor is perfectly acceptable, but it doesn't reflect the INCREDIBLE quality of the food
This is literally some of the best food I've ever eaten in my life
I heard about it through word of mouth, and I will definitely be going back -- and telling everyone to try it!
The Scene The warm, dim dining room wrapped in exposed brick is an easy place to while away an evening
Communal tables make for a convivial atmosphere
Reserve a cozy window seat for more privacy, or hop onto a stool at the bar to dine solo
Service is casual, yet precise
The Food Hearty, homey dishes are the draw, and appetizers, such as caramelized onion risotto and an outstanding cream of cauliflower soup with truffle oil, set the bar high
Among entrees, the Newport steak and braised lamb shank, which arrives falling off the bone into a savory mix of sausage and white beans, stand out
As does the monkfish, which virtually melts into the soft fennel and buttery lobster broth it's perched on
There's also veal saltimbocca with lettuce, prosciutto and cauliflower puree
Had a reservation on a Friday night and arrived on time and was seated promptly and was provided menus
Good start so far
proceeded to go through the wine list and select a wine, appetizer, and main courses over the next 15 minutes
only problem was no one seemed inclined to want to take our order or so much as provide us with water
I figured this probably wasn't a good way to start the night, so we left
mind you the restaurant was probably only 75% full, so it definitely wasn't a case of an overwhelmed staff
Food prices also seemed high given the relatively low-rent ambiance
good food? Maybe, but I'll never return to find out
The place is nice and staff is fine
The food, however, left much to be desired
The tagliatelle really lived up to the name of the restaurant- it was so salty I could not finish it
The salmon was good, but something anyone can wip up at home
If you are looking for a good price and really good ambience this is your place, but dont expect great food
Eat here and stoll over to the film forum and you'll have a nice date
It's amazing that such a small place run by 1 waitress and 1 busboy could be so amazing
The casual, yet, elegant ambiance is beautiful and not intimidating
The service is impeccable, knowledgable, and friendly

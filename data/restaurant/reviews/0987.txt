One little 12th is a great place to meet after work, smart suits fill the place
The ambiance is classy as the watrises are in they're Versace dresses
As far as scenes go it really upscale and chic
The drinks are good, although kinda pricy
Music is a smooth groove ot top 40
All in all very attractive peoply including the bartenders
Don't go on the weekend though, very BT not a good crowd
One has great music that makes everyone dance, gorgeous decor, and very professional owners who have been extremely polite to every guest I have brought in
much easier to take clients and expect to have a great time than many other trendy places in the meatpacking
Cannot wait to take advantage of the outdoor seating this summer!
My wife and I invited our friends to a late dinner and were having drinks afterwards when the manager instructed the waitress not to serve us any more drinks as it was bottle service
This was after we had spent close to $700 on food and drinks
After I had complained to a bouncer (the manager would not see me) a waiter was sent over and did get us our drinks
Soon after, the hostess came over and told us to leave the table


it was reserved for someone who was buying a bottle
TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THE ENTIRE PLACE WAS COMPLETELY EMPTYwe were the only table occupied
My party was greatly inconvenienced, and I was embarrassed and insulted
This is not Lotus, and no one should have to put up with this nonsense in a restaurant while spending considerable money
I liked ONE a lot
Aside from the service being slow, the place was packed w/ a good crowd and music was amazing
The food was good too
If you can get past the door, its worth a trip just to see the legs on the hostess as you walk in
I just had the best squid salad and boston black cod dish ever
what a great spot in the meatpacking district
Love the Mango martini! Can't wait to go back for the sunday Brunch!
I live in the neighborhood, and am always welcomed when i come
i like to have dinner there during the week when it is more intimate and less crazy
I like to stop by for a drink over the weekend
a couple of weeks ago we were a large group, got a table in the center lounge
a great time made up of music that made us move, people that made us feel good, and our cute waitress that added the finishing touch
One suggestion - Don't get there too late
I came to this website to actually say how great this place is, and funny enough, how the door preson is a breath of fresh air compared to what i am used to in NYC
it is a lounge not a club
it provides great music fun, and yes!! bottle service!! the bar is a little too small and fills up quick
the girl in front lets everyone in, and will chat with you while you wait
she assured us we wont wait too long, and we didnt
it is what it is
some people need to lighten up, those bad reviews really surprised me
Great scene if you can get in the door- come early- stay late
Drinks are 12 for the specialties, 8 for a vodka tonic
The place is packed and is a great mix of friendly locals and scenesters
Attentive and attractive bartenders mean eye candy for the women as well
Didn't eat but everything that went by looked delicious and the prices were reasonable for the area- which means expensive but not exorbitantly so
If we can get back through the door- we'll be back!
Great place for a birthday party
The downstairs room is private, yet open, so you don't feel isolated
Not ideal for a full scale meal, though the food is pretty good
More of a tapas feel to the menu
Great for a lite meal and then drinking
Very good looking crowd, so I'd think twice about bringing a date here
Don't go late without a reservation on a Fri/Sat night or else you'll be waiting
The service is severely lacking, so beware
I had my traditional birthday blow out
and it was so much fun during dinner, that we ended up staying all night
instead of going to a bar/club
Bottle Service was great, and everyone loved the transition from restaurant to lounge
found this place because another restaurant in the area made a mistake with our reservation
our disappointment was quickly reversed after being greeted by a warm atmosphere and friendly staff
the food was delicious
There is no service at this bar, which means no drinks or food -- ultimately leading to a very frustrating night out, and you end up kicking yourself for not leaving an hour earlier
One is the 'new kid on the block'; trying to impress by keeping some out, others in and appealing to the masses through their 'best of the best' word of mouth campaign
Went to this 'swank' hideout for the 'in' and was met with service that was disasterous, from the doorman to the servers
At one point, a waitress for our table wouldn't serve us
Truth be known, there was no reason for her 'attitude and pretentious aire'
The last time I checked One was a bar, but the proprieters must only want to keep up their che-che image
I wish them well, but would recommend any of the other lounges in the Meat Packing district before One, which I found to unpleasantly misrepresent it's name
I propose a name change from One to One Hundred, but then they'd have to relocate
Went last saturday night due to the reviews listed here
Those must all be written by friends and staff because this is the worst restaurant I've been to in a long time
Food was okay but the portions were tiny and the service was so bad it was laughable
The place is nice looking but there are a lot of nice looking places in the city that know what good service means
Go elsewhere unless you like rude waitresses and long waits for tiny tiny portions of overpriced food
It's a great place to bring a date
It has a taste of romance and lots of class
but nowhere near cheesy
Your woman, or even man, will be impressed with this new hot spot
The menu offers a unique experience of sharing, tasting and exploring
all great things we want on a date!! But be careful with wondering eyes, the crowd is an eye pleaser!!
Delectable and delightful! Candle light and great jazzy/funky music It all comes together to create an inviting vibe creating a desire to stay longer and come back for more! Check it out for yourself, but I recommend making reservations, it fills up quickly with a good looking crowd and smiley faces try the Naughty School Girl cocktail it comes with a surprise treat!!
We had a great time at ONE
Although the service was a little slow we did not care
The food was awesome, the music and vibe was great and best of all we got in
No usual NY BS at the door
Will definately go back
ONE Is a great place in the meatpacking district
It has everything, great food, great scene, great vibe and no door hassle, you cnat beat that
The drinks are excellent and the menu is different and fun
We had a great time there and were very surpirsed for the lack of attitude at a downtown place
ITS the ONE
The Scene Every inch of Koji Imai's first stateside restaurant (he owns dozens in Japan) is meticulously designed in a mix of modern and antique motifs
Porcelain rice-bowl columns teeter high above the auditorium-sized dining area, and a gigantic temple bell suspends over a bottom-lit ice carving
Pampering servers, decked out in haute Japonica, flutter between cavernous leather booths and the long sushi bar
Even the celebs seem impressed
The Food  The modern, largely organic, high-dollar Japanese menu deserves the drama of its showy setting
The kitchen abandons courses in favor of shared plates: first, yuzu-doused micro-greens and flower petals; next, bonito-rich edamame puree
Raw fish--from buttery uni sushi to glistening toro tartare--is exceedingly fresh
So are cooked plates: Marinated Kobe beef practically melts on its skewers, soy-buttered scallops collapse with sweet brine and Chawanmushi custard, quivering in eel-soy broth with black truffles and foie gras, is over the top
It is a good place if you like to spend $$$ to wait for your waiter

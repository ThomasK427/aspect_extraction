You have to go downstairs to use the bathroom
i have been going to this restaurant last 6 years
i love their food,service, and very decent place where everyone like to eat
they making one of the best nan in new york
i am living far in long island but i would rather drive and have great food
most likely i am celebrating my all occacion with india passge
i recomened a lot people their
i am letting everyone know if you haven't try please try it and take your decision
I have been going to this restaurant for over a decade and it never ceases to please me
The prices are always fair and have gone up very little over the years, despite the growth in the neighborhood
They offer a small but good selection of beer and wine from India, and their cuisine can please the most spice-averting palates of those American friends of yours who claim to not like Indian food
The service has always been exemplary and very attentive, but then again they know me for forever!
I was at India Passage this week to celebrate my birthday
I was there once before and the food is great
Listen to the waiter, his suggestions are excellent
For appetizers try vegetable samosas and chicken wings
Chicken tikka was an excellent entree choice and chopped salad was tangy and delicious
Desert is rosehip ice cream or mango ice cream, i never had such delicious desert
The only drawback is when they are busy, like yesterday, the service falls around average and you need to catch the waiter to get water or soda or pretty much anything else and the music is a little loud
Other than that, for $30 person you will have one of the best meals and that included a bottle of wine
It was my first time to dine at an Indian Restaurant and this one just blew my mind
The food was excellent and the service equally good
It is indeed a romantic and beautiful place to have your dinner in peace! I was totally impressed
The ice cream at the end of the meal was a surprise and I loved it
My husband and I have been to numerous Indian restaurants over the years, many of which were located in Manhattan and highly recommended
It is well worth the trip to Brooklyn to dine at this hidden gem of a restaurant
This place has become our gold standard for restaurant evaluations -- consistently excellent food prepared under the ever watchful eye of the owner
The ambiance and service are simply superb
We highly recommend this restaurant -- a must go destination
Went around 9PM before a movie with a friend
Started with veg samosas, which were not overly fried or greasy
After having the table cleared and recieving fresh warm plates, we shared the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken and Lentils
The chicken was very tender and moist in general
The Tikka Masala was well seasoned and not overly heavy with cream or seasoned with tomato
The lentils were light and cooked well
Not once did our water glasses go empty, as the service was outstanding
One of the top Indian places I have ever been to, and probably the best for service
I've tried many different Indian restaurants in Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan ranging from the expensive to the cheap bargains
and out of all of them, this place wins hands down for cuisine
I've frequented this place and everytime the food is great
If you're a meat eater, try the mixed grill of two types of Chicken, two types of Lamb and grilled shrimp, served on a sizzling platter with onions and peppers
The Chicken Tikka is so moist, plump, seasoned so well and simply divine (you don't need any extra sauces to get this well marinated chicken down
The soft naan bread is heaven with there spicy, creamy sauce that's served on the side
And they finish your meal off with mango and rosehip ice cream
a really clean way to finish of this rich meal
Warning Service is decent, but it takes forever to get the check
This is great take-out Chinese food
No atmosphere, no eating in, just awesome Chinese classics
I went into this place thinking it was just a regular pizza joint
But unbeknownst to me it was a night at the Moulin Rouge gone bad
The food was barely decent and our server was nowhere to be found
I nearly died of dehydration by the time he finally came back around - to drop off the check! But the worst part of all was suffering through the worst renditions of My Girl and My Heart Belongs to Daddy I have ever heard in my life
I wanted to rip my hair out by the end of the meal
If you like terrible singing and mediocre food, this is the place for you
I highly recommed this restaurant for groups as we were a group of 8 singing shopping ladies the food was very good and the price was reasonable
We were greeted we  smiling faces and seated within 10 min
Our bartender was Jerry who was very welcoming and he made the best chocolate martini'
We really enjoyed the entertainment and the loster stoli is highly recommended this is definitely a place to check out and we traveled by cab from New York (Financial District) and we had  no transportation problems
We had reservations for a Saturday at 8pm
When we arrived our name was crossed off the list and we were told that we would have a 30 minute wait for a table
We watched as several groups of people were seated
At 8:30pm we were told that we would have at least another hour wait for a table, and were asked who took our reservation because they don't make reservations for two people
Then we were told that they couldn't seat us unless we sat in the bar area
After a prolonged argument we were finally seated
Outside the restaurant was a sandwich board sign advertising the dine out in Brooklyn dinner special
We were told the special dinner prices were extended but not on Friday or Saturday nights
I've always had my reservations honored and advertised specials were also honored
Excellent food cannot compensate for horrible treatment
I've always loved the ambiance in the restaurant
This is a great restaurant for a large group since everything is family style
I've eaten here several times since it first opened and everytime i had a nice time
However, one of the drawbacks is that prices are very high
It is nice for a special occasion
It's nice to go for lunch because they have the optional feature of indivual plates which is nice
Another nice feature is that they have a live singer there and they fit right in with the ambiance of a small italian village
The hanging laundry line makes gives it an authetic italian homey feeling
THE DECOR IS FUN! THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT! AND THE YOUNG LADY SINGING WAS ENJOYABLE AND THE KIDS LIKED HER STYLE
THE SERVICE TO OUR TABLE WAS EXCELLENT
I went here for a Wedding Rehearsal Dinner and it was so much fun
We had a singer while we were eating and the food was great
This is a great place for a big group and a party type event
All dishes are for 2
The food is OK
The decor and ambience are interesting but a bit strange
The dishes are huge
But even salads are for 2 and the price reflects it
I guess it's a place where big people like to come and eat as much as can handle
This is not a nice romantic place as some people make it to be based on the reviews
I was disappointed
This isn't a great date place because they have family sized plates of food but its sooo much fun with a group of people
We took my cousins from Italy here and they loved the pasta! The atmosphere is very lively and fun
You eat while clotheslines hang over your head AND
depending on the night, they will have an Elvis or Frank Sinatra, etc
impersonator singing to you!
I went to Goodfellas with a group of about 10 people
The service was unbelievably slooooow and by the time we were finally served, all of our food was COLD! Definitely not worth the wait!
When I moved to Bay Ridge a year ago, I was excited because there were so many different places to eat
Unfortunately, I've been extremely disappointed, as I've found that despite the variety, there only a few places with food good enough to deserve your time and money
Goodfella's is one of them
Their pastas are great, and their brick-oven bread is to die for

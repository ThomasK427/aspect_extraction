I thought this place might be a good place to eat
Boy, was I wrong! They give you a teaspoon of soup and charge you up the wazzu
The soup was pretty good, but the value is horrible
I'll take my money elsewhere from now on if I want more than a pinch of sustenance
The Scene Regulars sneak down an unassuming stairway into this cavernous, brick-wrapped room for a distinguished dose of la dolce vita
European jetsetters exchange air kisses at the tiny bar, gregarious groups pass oversized antipasto platters and couples retreat to elegant candlelit corner tables
The mood is formal yet fun: Suited waiters toss pastas tableside while flirting with every woman in sight
The Food For more than a decade, Scalinatella has been famous for two things: superlative traditional Italian cooking and a colorful cast of deep-pocketed devotees who can afford it
Order like a regular, skipping the short, pedestrian menu in favor of recited signature specials: Exquisitely grilled balsamic-garlic "scotta dita" lamb, and gargantuan, tender veal chops slathered with porcini are worth the trip alone
Pastas and fish are exemplary: Light ragu-tossed tagliatelle, delicate ricotta ravioli and roasted Dover sole couldn't be more delicious
Only the accompanying bland polenta and carrot-broccoli melange seem uninspired
If your idea of fun is to drop $250 a head (THEN the waiters will be respectful) while entertaining your goodfellas or goumada, this is the place for you
You think you've found a secret after hours restaurant when you enter this place
Everyone very attentive to your needs
The food and service was impeccable
Don't know what to order or something not exactly to your liking
Ask and they will recommend something that will make you happy
I had the homemade stuffed raviolis w/fish and the salt encrusted sea bass
Both out of this world! Delicious
The tuna steak with carmalized onions amazing as well
Don't think you can go wrong with anything that you order
I enjoyed the seafood salad and cold zucchini/mushroom in garlic and oil to start w/the fresh bread
A must for a special occassion -
The food was good -- the most unforgettable part, though, was the rude staff
They were unattentive and arrogant
A couple of waiters actually screamed at a table leaving too little tip -- loud enough so the whole restaurant got the message loud and clear
This restaurant was absolutely wonderful, a pleasant surprise, my boyfriend and I walked down the stairs to look for a menu and ended up in the dinining room at that point we had to give it a try
EVERYTHING was just so fresh and full of flavor, all of the staff treated us very well and definitely knew what they were talking about, we will definitely return to this hidden gem
I have lived nearby Scalinatella for 3 years, yet never ventured inside to sample the cuisine---until last night
I was very impressed with the ambiance, service, menu and the food
I had homemade pasta with shaved black truffles- and it was one of the best meals I have ever tasted (and I frequent top rated restaurants)
My friend had a more simple pasta and was also very pleased with his meal
The wine list is extensive
We indulged on wine instead of dessert
I will definitely be back
Outstanding
Our waiter and the host/m'd/steward were real pros and really comfortable to be around
The table tidbits were delicious at the beginning
The goat cheese and spinich salad was nice, and the ox-tail pasta was superb
I tasted the veal a friend had and it was among the best I have ever tasted
My new favorite in NYC
It was my boyfriends idea to try this place out and it quickly became our favorite restaurant
As soon as we walked into this dimly lit restaurant it gives you the feeling that you are in another country, not just because of the wine-cellar setting but also the courtesy
We were greeted by friendly staff that eagerly awaited to take our coats, and we were seated immediately even though we didnt make reservations
Once seated we were quickly served complimentary pre-dishes, the zucchini was delicious
The waiters were very friendly and the food was great
for dessert try the chocolate moose, it was fantastic
I recommend scalinatella to everyone, except to those who would have a prolem spending $120 for a full course meal for two(tip included)
This cozy italian restaurant is right across from where I live and I am so happy to have found it
The food is amazing, fresh, flavorful, and plentiful
The service is fantastic and everyone has a sense of humor
It looks deceiving from the outside b/c on the inside it has a cozy wine cellar feel
This is a perfect restaurant for a romantic evening or an evening with friends
The linguine bolognese is especially good as are all of the veal dishes
There are also a large variety of specials so listen close!
Go around the corner from Bloomie's, take a short flight down and discover this precious hideway
It's an Italian Sweet Spot that never disappoints
My last visit was two years ago, and it's not changed a lick
The service is attentive and personable- with no distinction between stuffy corporate suits and junior music moguls in scruffy garb
Don't ask for a menu- take the trip with your waiter who eloquently (and vividly) describes dishes until he sees your eyes light up
It's crowded, but still has an air or intimacy that almost overshadows the food
To my taste, the BEST Chilean Sea Bass this side of the Mississippi and a whole baby artichoke appetiser that could be a meal in itself
And how interesting to be in such a fabulous place, with a very mixed crowd and see everyone (even the bus boys!) smiling
A real treat
Though we had to wait about 45 minutes from our dinner reservation time, we were given breadsticks, olives and parmasean to nibble on while we waited, albeit in the very cramped bar area
The waitstaff was very accomodating and attentive and the food was excellent
Try the appetizer portion of the pasta with truffle sauce, as it's very rich
Ambience: very crowded, cramped and bustling
The food was amazing
The vealchops are the best in the city
The Waitstaff was terrible
I thought they were going to sit on my lap
Young socialites beware
they will ignore you
For a place that wasn't busy on a Saturday night, they were terrible
In Short The name comes from the drawings of acrobats and tightrope walkers adorning the walls, and the circus theme shines through in the restaurant's festive flavor
There's no clown-car crowdedness, with plenty of room to dine--either on red cushioned benches in the front or in the wine bottle-filled back room
Customers make snapper ceviche, braised octopus and chorizo, and churrasco disappear
And, in a trick that would impress Houdini himself, they still have room for flan
We came across this place after shopping at Bloomingdales
We tried to get into a couple other places that were packed and then came across this place which had room
We had no idea what to expect but were pleasantly surprised by the good food and attentive wait staff
I had the crab appetizer and the cod for an entree
Both were great
I highly recommend the cod, it melted in my mouth
The rest of my party (3 others) enjoyed their food as well
Went there in a group of 7
Very good drinks from the bar and the wine was good
The food was excellent
I had the mixed grill, the meat was marinated and grilled to perfection
The crab w/ coconut sauce was very good, too
Definitely will go back again
Service is good but may be a little slow when they are busy
The portions are smaller and the price is definitely not cheap, but you get what you paid for
I like the smaller portion size for dinner
The crab appetizer in coconut sauce was wonderful
Pork tenderloin and red snapper marinated in herbs and banana leaf were delicious
Great caipirinha
For dessert, had the chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and roasted pineapple with coconut sorbet, both were very good
THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT! It was a nice change from Italian restaurants, still similar in feel yet different at the same time

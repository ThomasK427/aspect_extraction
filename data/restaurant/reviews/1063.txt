They advertise that they do parties, but they are not able to handle a large amount of people
I will not be returning here
from the outside, it doesn't look like a large place, but once you get past the bar, it's a huge room full of nick knacks
we went for dessert
the mini warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream was heavenly
the cheese cake was just right
the bread they served as we sat down had a pastry-like crunch on the outside and still warm
I go to brunch here once a week, and I enjoy it all the time
Brunch prices are not higher then 15 dollars, which includes one brunch drink(love the sangria), and the pastry self service bar
The service is good, and the food is good as well
More bang for your buck
Also, a better alternate to Diner
***Took my folks, it still sucks
Even thy didn't like it***I do not recommend wandering off to this cafe
By American Bistro I think they must mean Ponderosa or Country Buffet
Creepy child like statues and expensive, eclecticly named food do not make the lights any less bright in this un-williamsburg-like restaurant

what's with the Used Car Lot flags all over the place? Looks like a great place to have a bridge club or PTA meeting
Had a big party that they put lots of stuff on the check that wasn't ordered
Talk to the manager was very uncooperative
BAD SERVICE!
By williamsburgh standards it does not stand out
The staff is painfully and politely on top of you
Are you ready for another one sir? I will call when I am ready for another one
When I actually did ask for another one it did not come in a good while, upon getting someones attention they asked me what was the name of my server (Cisco
lol)
Iam not interesated in having to remember the name of the server
I am interested in attentive and inconspicuous service, at those prices anyway
I just went for Sunday brunch and expected the usual Wburg dirty omelette but I got service with a smile, fantastic fresh food and a complimentary Bloody Mary
I had the North 6, a grilled veggie sandwich with a side of homefries for $10 and it was delish! Generous portions too
And live piano music! Nothing bad about that
Everytime i go to the williamsburgh cafe, i am more and more impressed
The menu is interesting, always fun seasonal dishes ( tonight i had a delicious wood oven tuna dish) and the friendly, attentive fun staff make the experience even better
I enquired about having a large party there and the hostess was very helpful
Always a pleasure
The food is really dfferent and delicious
The brunch menu is excellent and you get a lot for your buck
The service was HORRIBLE the last 2 times I was there
Luckily the food makes up for it
The desserts were really inovative and well-priced
Came here a couple times when the joint first opened and was not wowed
The new chef has changed all that and I look forward to dining here on a regular basis
Brunch is awesome!
Something just doesn't work at this place
The menu looks good, the prices are reasonable and the decor is different
however, the two times I have gone there I have been very disappointed with my meal
The waitstaff is annoying and too pushy
The brunch is a deal though if you are looking for average food -- they put on a good spread of free pastries and bruschetta
I love this place
Not sure why some have said it's expensive because it's definitely comparable to other neighborhood restaurants
I love the decor and the brunch was superfabulous!!!!
for the past month the buzz in the burg' was go to the williamsburg cafe for brunch
So i finally went this past Sunday
what a train wreck
once my wife and i were sat at are table it took at least 10 minutes to get our water,we then ordered our food
After waiting 20 min the food finally came to us
It arrived very oily,burnt,and brown
The hashbrowns tasted like charcoal,the pesto omelet was swimming in a pool of green oil
Need i say more
I dont know where the BUZZ came from but it is about to FIZZ
It's hard to choose what the best part of my brunch experience was at the Williamsburg Cafe
The staff was unbelievably nice, the Bloody Mary's (included with brunch) were fantastic, the menu was awesome (extensive with all kinds of interesting stuff), and the food was even better
The prices are reasonable, but on the more expensive side ($10-$14 per brunch)
If you're looking for a great place to get brunch, look no further
I can't wait to get dinner there
This place is way to confusing for a restaurant and obviously the staff is affected as well
The food is all over the place and to be honest below average
I've eaten there twice in the past week to give it a chance both times i started with one of the mussel dishes both times way to salty and there was no real sauce just a salty wet broth
I have tried the cobb salad and the vinaigrette was pure vinegar, i sent it back
I also had a chicken sandwich,the meat was so dried out i thought it was microwaved
The waiter was clueless about the winelist both visits
This place is a real DUD!
I've eaten at WBC a dozen times and have never had a bad meal
They have $5 drink specials and the wine list is amazingly cheap
The service can be slow at times, but the servers are very nice
It's good for dates, business meals or just to hang with your friends
Someone mentioned child-like statues and used car lot flags
Where? Were you in the right restaurant? I think you might be reviewing some other place
Has great food for the price
In a nice, chill part of Williamsburg
Service has also been pretty nice and helpful without any attitude
What more can you ask for? Brunch has been great the 2 times I've been there
This place is new to north side of wiliiamsburg
From the outside it looks like a quirky outdoor cafe
Then on the inside its a mecca of horiculture and exposed brick and candles the ambiance is an expierience in its self
The entrees are written each week on a chalkboard that each table recieves
I had the sicilian mussels (the best broth i've ever had) and the french lentils both recieve a standing ovation
Definetly keep a eye on this place
It's way, way overpriced
it's very mediocre
Anything that's good is offset by something bad on the same plate
Waitstaff are dolts
and the ambiance is utterly out of place for the neighborhood--in fact, it's out of place for the city
But who's writing all these positive reviews? they clearly are not people who: 1) know the neighborhood (since they say things like overlook the area--hello, it's 2 blocks from the heart of the northside, on a pleasant residential block); 2) know anything about food (since they're so easily impressed by the gimmicky menu that doesn't amount to much in practice and by the hot employees); 3) have any sense of aesthetics (since they find the place charming
Avoid it--there are so many better (and less expensive) places in the 'hood
Don't be put off by the area or outside appearance -the interior ambiance is charming
This place is a real gem
Although tucked away in a commercial area this restaurant is a REAL find
We were warmly welcomed by Jessie at the door
The atmosphere is eclectic the building has an interesting history

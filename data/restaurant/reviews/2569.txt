My favorite part, though, was the basket of crudities, bread and the sausage tree and pate that make up their appetizer course
It can be a meal on it's own
If you're interested in slicing vegetables, and chopping off hunks of questionable sausage, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU!! However, if you are looking for a reasonably priced bistro experience, try down the street -- any street
Seriously
This is no good
Not at all
If you must eat here, such as for a high school field trip, fill up on the bread and duck pate or slice up a nice piece of celery
or a whole plum tomato! Kudos for creating arguably the most unique dining ambiance in the New York area
The French Revolution wallpaper should have stayed in whosever attic it was found in
And, if you have an attic, you should hang out in it rather than spending your $$ here
While this place won't impress a business client, it does provide a homey feel and delivers delicious food! I had the steak frites with the green peppercorn sauce and it was very good
I sampled the muscles and they were delicious (I hope you like garlic, lol)
Other people in our party had the Chicken cordon bleu and the salmon and each person was fully satisfied with their choice
The mousse au chocolate was dense, rich, and delectable! I recommend it to all chocolate lovers
Ce n'est pas extraordinaire
A completely mediocre dining experience
The sauces were overly salty
The house red is drinkable
The bread was alright
The calfoutis was bland
Nothing was bad, but nothing was wonderful, other than my dining partner's conversation
Friday night, 10:30 pm, Jauary 17, 2003
IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE
The place had maybe 4 or 5 other people in it
We poked our heads in for a few bottles of wine, some good hot onion soup and a few hot appetizers to warm us up after a seeing a show
Gee
After we sat down and started ordering, the waiter informed us that they were really only into serving dinners
What's that all about, I ask you? There were 4 of us! So we went and spent our $250
00 elsewhere
OK, this place is refreshingly down to earth for a French restaurant, but is the food really French? Located in the middle of Restaurant Row, its patrons are mostly tourists and theatre goers and the place has a lively, friendly ambiance
It is definitely good value for the money but the food is far from spectacular
The most imaginative item on the menue are the hanging sausages and vegetable basket appetizer served peasant style, but thats more of a gimmic than anything else
We had dinner here on a slow Monday night
Wonderful fixed price menu
My dining companion agreed that my chicken cordon bleu was fabulous
Her fish was also quite nice
Creme brule and chocolate mousse for dessert
The best mousse I've had in quite a while
This is a great place for groups
The sausages veggies on the table encourage sharing
Good French food at a reasonable price plus the wait staff will have you out in time for the theatre
I stopped in here because I arrived early for an 8:30pm show nex door at don't tell mama and, wow, what a great meal and a great deal
Next time, I'll PLAN to eat there before the comedy show
Thanks to all the French staff who are very charming and accomodating
Stopped in on June 22 to try their soup-very disappointed
Soup lacked flavor and for the price I've had larger bowls at other restaurants
My son and his girlfriend felt the same as I did
My husband and I went to Foleys last year for our anniversary before watching a play
We had such a nice experience
The sunset in Times Square was so romantic
The food, drinks, and staff were excellent
The only con is that it's a little pricey even by NYC standards
Enjoy!
I am a native NYer who works in TS and I don't normally dine in TS on the weekends because I'm there all week, but I took an out of town guest there before the theater
It was a nice time
The waitstaff were very cordial and friendly, the food was good, and the timing between courses was great
We never felt ignored nor rushed
We knew we had time and were trying to keep it at a good pace
The waiters seemed to pay attention to our pace and not theirs
The shrimp cocktail was generous, the entree (sole w/ risotto) was very good, the bread pudding w/ cinnamon icecream was fantastic
They made a terrific latte (more like Italy and less like Starbucks)
My companion loved the lobster tails and cheesecake
A nice time was had by all
I would definitely recommend
I really enjoyed the food and the view at Foley's!! i found the resturant on citysearch and i am very pleased with my find!! The starters and the entree's were very enjoyable, the desert could have been better
We started with the garlic and white wine mussles
They were very tasty and was just the right amount
As wait shortly for you main course to come out there is plenty of conversation pieces as you stare out at TImes Square! We enjoyed the blackened swordfish and the panseared filet of sole of a bed of seafood risotto! Both the meals were a delight and the service were not overwhelming it was the perfect mix of privacy and hospitality !! we had a sov
blanc cali wine which was complimentry of the meals
The desert was not all that good but the whole experience was enjoyable and i will return
The food was decent- no better or worse than the average hotel restaurant- but the service was awful, waiting for water, waiting 15 minutes to order even though we clearly mentioned we were pre-theater
The views of Times Square are great- but go for a drink and have dinner elsewhere
Located in the Rennaissance Hotel in Time Square this restraunt offers the best view of Time Square you can find
The food is wonderful including the breakfast
If your a visitor to New York this is a must
If you can, also look up the hotel, your in walking distance to almost everything
It makes for a very nice vacation
We live in Midtown and decided to go out to dinner in Times Square after seeing Mama Mia, we found Foley's on Citysearch and decided to try it
The view was so beautiful and we were all very pleased with the dining experience
The wine list was good, and all of the seafood and steak dishes were tasty
Finally, a place to enjoy after a show
The view is breathtaking, the hotel is comfortable, pretty and friendly and the seafood was perfectly prepared
This will be our new found place to stay the next time we're in New York
The view is better than any restaurant in Times Square and it was surprising quiet and relaxing
I have been to FCC many times over the years and it was always OK but fun
Now that they are revamping the entire restaurant (New dining room, new private room, new bathrooms and a new Chef with a great reputation according to my server) things are REALLY looking up
If the organic baby chicken I had tonight is any indication of what is to come, this place will gain a whole new reputation as a food oriented semi-serious restaurant rather than a bar
I can't wait !!
We went into Film Center brunch with high hopes
The menu looked great and we were in desparate need for a complimentary hair of the dog that bit us
But our bubble was soon bursted when we sipped by far the worst bloody mary ever
I'm actually not entirely convinced that she knew how to make a bloody mary
When our food arrived it was cold, the eggs were over cooked, and chances of us getting some hot sauce were slim to none as the waitress never managed to check back with us after we placed our initial orders
We noticed that the other reviews a back dated a few years and just wanted to throw in a more recent experience
I would say there are so many options for brunch in this neighborhood that you can definitely stand to pass on this one
So the service isn't great
But, if you have the time to sit a while and enjoy yourself, the mimosas are unlimited and the food is just what the hangover/sleepover crowd ordered
We've tried the veggie burger, yam fries, eggs benedict, and strawberry pancakes
Everything was scrumpcious and the mimosas were strong!
The food was pretty good, but the waitress could not have cared less

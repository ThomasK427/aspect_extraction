Ludo is absolutely terrible as a night spot
I brought a group of friends there ~10pm on a Friday
The place wasn't even full yet the bouncer made people wait outside unless you were getting bottle service
The general manager was rude and disrespectful when I spoke to him
This place is NOT worth its ridiculous policies, velvet rope, and bad attitude
The bouncer told my friend to move when he was in the downstairs area by the womens bathroom because he might confuse female patrons
My entire party and I left to go to another bar because Ludo was so bad
Considering how poorly they run their business, I cant wait to see Ludo go out of business
We went along to this place to meet some friends there
The first thing they told us was because we were three males we weren't ever getting in
Then while my friend was calling his girlfriend who was in there, the doorman told him he was being obnoxious just for talking on the phone
They told us to move off the steps, then they told us to move off the sidewalk
Didn't even look that good inside
Basically this place has the most sensitive doorman in the city and a snooty and rude velvet rope policy that is not welcome in the east village - GET OUT
My friends and I come in to town every Saturday night to hit Ludo
It's amazing, charming, romantic and ever so beautiful
There are candles everywhere and there are aways lots of cute boys
A couple of weeks ago we met one of the owners, Ravi, ever so charming! He brought us over shots and we've even been allowed to dance on the bar
The line can be long trying to get in, but it's so worth it! Ludo is fabulous, I can think of a million good things to say about it
but you'll have to see for yourself! It's the best eastern club in town!
Went here for a friend's birthday party
The staff was incredibly rude and obnoxious
Even though she reserved a table they STILL wouldn't let the rest of her party through the door even though the place wasn't even close to being full
Furthermore, their drinks are WAY overpriced
$50 on 4 Kamikaze shots?!?! Please
Don't waste your time here
I was at Ludo for a birthday party recently
Although the bar was not that crowded, the manager turned guests away because we refused to buy more than one bottle
Buying *any* bottles was not part of the arrangement made when we called beforehand
The manager was extremely rude, aloof, and condescending
I will not go back
dilicious food! four room w/ different atmosphere
romantic, fun, beautiful and yummi! must check this place!
My friend and I went here in August, and it was a nice time
This restaurant is gorgeous
The bar was nice
The food was good, but pricey
Nice special occasion place
At first you walk in and it seems like a nice bar, but not atypical in any real sense
The blue stairs get your attention of course, and when you go down them you realize how special Ludo's is
It's beautiful, warm, friendly, the perfect place to meet a group of friends, relax and mingle
I've met so many great people here, I almost don't want to write this
But Ludo's deserves some good words
The food is nothing less than incredible
You can't go wrong here
Went with some girlfriends for drinks and appetizers and it was an amazing experience
From the moment you walk in you are greeted with warmth and friendliness
Would definately recommend!!!!!
I came here for dinner with my girlfriend and had a blast
Dinner was awesome
I had the steak, and she had the porcini pastry
Needless to say, it was spectacular
Afterwards, we decided to stay around for drinks
and it was a totally different scene
Its like being at 2 different places in one night
The bar scene was hopping , and the lounge was bumping
We will definitely be back for seconds
I went here on a first date and we had a wonderful time
Met for drinks at the upstairs bar where the cute and helpful bartender suggested the cucumber ricky
A great refreshing cocktail made with gin and cucumbers
We then headed downstairs for dinner, which was excellent
the kibbeh is delicious as was my entree of grilled pork tenderloin
My date had the ten spice skirt steak, which he said was delish
ate it so fast I didn't even get a bite
Overall this place is really great with beautiful decor
I'll definitely be back with my girlfriends for drinking and dancing
I went on a Saturday night on the recommendation of the new General Manager, Mike who also did Cheetah Club and Le Souk
He told me the food was going to be amazing and it was! Th DJ was pretty good and the dance space, though small, was cool on a hot night
I liked the servers who were pretty friendly and the wine list was awesome
I had the tiger shrimp a gin ricky
That drink is amazing! Mike promised that the food will get better and the late night will be even more fun
I followed him since Cheetah so I know it will be GREAT!!!!
Went to Ludo for a friend's birthday party, wasn't impressed by the rude staff or the homely jeans--t-shirt-donning BT crowd that trickled in steadily
Inside was too loud and the crowd was dull touristy - felt more like Jersey
I soon left with several friends in favor of a more welcoming, cooler bar with better-looking peeps and a less style- smile-challenged staff
Though i dug the blue-lit staircase, Ludo is a bubble of cheesy, misplaced attitude masquerading as a trendy bar in the EV
Beware!
My girlfriends and I went there this past weekend for dinner and had an unbelievable time
The food was awesome and the service only made it better
You have to try the ceviche and the skirt steak
We could not stop raving about the food
Afterwards, we went to the bar and lounge for drinks
and had an a fantastic time
I would recommend the watermelon martini
It was fresh and had me bombed in no time
Just make sure that Jeff (hottie) makes the drinks
Definitely be back there soon!!
I was not interested in hanging out at a bar, much less dancing and drinking, since I was STARVING!! But my friends insisted I'd have plenty to eat AND have a good time
THEY WERE RIGHT!!! We entered Ludo, were greeted by one of the owners who was so sweet
He directed us downstairs to where the action was
We arrived at 9 on a Thurs nite w/o reservation, but we (4 girls) were accomodated at the bar! Menu was tricky since I had not heard of some of the dishes, so I was encouraged to try new things which were delicious exotic! The DJ was playing great music and the crowd was fun gorgeous
We ate, drank, danced met so many people
We'll be going back with more friends real soon!!! Totally a great date place too
Very sexy atmosphere!
My boyfriend took me here to celebrate my birthday we were blown away
The food was delicious (skirt steak was awesome) - wine list was good - service was outstanding and the atmosphere relaxing
We went kind of early on a Friday night so I can't comment on the Dj/entertainment it was an extremely hot night so maybe it was slow - but we thought it was romantic and relaxing
I Celebrated my birthday on Aug 5th
We went for dinner there (The Tiger Shrimp and Watermelon Feta Salad appetizers, along with the Pork Sirloin are to DIE for)
Presentation is the key!!!

Nice bartenders, solid drinks
Food was really good
Oysters on the half were very good, and the fried green tomato app
was great
I had the Memphis ribs, and was a little disappointed as they were a little on the dry side
Virgils is better
Other people in the party had the catfish and the pulled pork sandwich, and they raved
All in all a good night out, and cool atmosphere, just dont be suprised if you aren't wowed when you leave
Great service
And real ribs are not drowning in sauce
These are smoked ribs
hence the name
Many people do not like the taste of smoked meats, and that's an important consideration when choosing this restaurant
These are not bottled-barbeque-drenched, sticky-finger ribs
These are great ribs, they way they are supposed to be, served in a casual atmostphere with good beer and bourbon
The fry bread with chipotle butter helps it along just fine
Explore the outer boros of NYC and hit up Queens for better BBQ
The food here does not live up to the hype-the ribs had an odd taste to them (meat? sauce?) and a diner in our party sent back the pulled pork platter which appeared to have been sent through an Enron shredder before hitting the plate
Good service but subpar food
If you're going to Blue Smoke looking for Gramercy Tavern-type food, you'll be disappointed
If you go looking for great BBQ, a festive atmosphere, cheery waitstaff and a good time, you'll be delighted
BBQ snobs, and there are many, dismiss this place as subpar and inauthentic
They should lighten up, have a cocktail, and sit bacl and enjoy their meal
Saw all the negative reviews here, but tried this place anyways
It's a ribs joint
plain and simple so what are people expecting? This ain't no chi-chi type of spot
They have a great selection of tasty ribs with all the sides
collard greens, mac 'n cheese, cole slaw, etc
The soup was and desserts were tasty, as well
The ambience suits the place, they place good music, the service was fine
I think the others that have reviewed this were expected a whole lot more
Take it for what it is and enjoy some beef!
Not bad but the restaurant definitely needs more time to improve its food
A bit of a hit or miss so far
Hmn?
Lets start with the good
Excellent service, friendly, quick and very attentive to patrons needs
Now the bad, unfortunately a restaurant cannot stand on it's merits of excellent service alone
It's a restaurant so it's main feature would be it's food
It's very bad
No it's very, very bad
Too much hype around this place that has placed it in 2nd place as one of the best BBQ joints
As New Yorkers this place makes us look very bad
As If we don't know what a good BBQ really is
Summary good service, bad food!
They kept on bringing out the wrong food to us, all of the food looked unappetizing and had no presentation
You would imagine that if you pay 6 dollars for a bucket of spicy cheese fries that these fries would be bigger then the ones they give you in fast food restaraunts
My brisket was gray and lifeless and there was no flavor to it at all
And the worst part about this BBQ place is that the BBQ sauce they give you at the table was liquidy
give me Virgils anytime!
The bar was great - bar food, drinks, and service
Dinner - well, service lacked a lot and I must say, the ribs at Houstons were better
The pulled pork was good but I have had just as good and better pulled pork at much less expensive restaurants in the city
Do try the wings at the bar however
We expected a lot more of this place
OK, the place has smoke in its name, but the food was too smoky
Sides like cole slaw should be great but weren't
We ordered corn bread and received too very mini loaves
The service was not overly attentive
On the other hand, if you plan to spend the evening at the Jazz Standard downstairs, Blue Smoke is very convenient
Scome college friends came to town, so my wife and I booked Blue Smoke well in advance, with high expectations
The service was very good--no wait at all despite being quite crowded
But the food was awful
The BBQ brisket tasted like school cafeteria food, the side orders were non-descript and if you're going to eat really unhealthy food, you really should enjoy it
Atmosphere is great, so this could be a great bar place, but oh, what a bummer that the food was a disaster
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in NYC
Talk about nothing special
The ribs were dry and flavorless
Like beef jerky on bones, with no sauce
The wet napkins they give you at the end of the meal were more moist and warm
However, the fry bread was very good
Kind of like beignets
Everything else was average
Why so many people like it is beyond me
It seems you either love it or hate it
We're in the later
Wonderful restaurant!! Friendly staff
The rib sampler is a good idea for the first timers
Try all three and pick your favorite
The sides were great as well
The sweet potato fries were huge steak fries,sweet and a great compliment to the ribs
Dessert was heaven
We tried the chocolate cake ,the key lime pie ,apple fritters and the sticky toffee pudding
All were magic but the toffee pudding sent us all to heaven
Moist cake sitting in a pool of toffee syrup
Fabulous!! After trying this place, have a feeling the bad reviews just might be from the competition
There are obviously 2 types of reviewers here
Ones that have eaten the food (Rated 4 and below) and owners/friends (Rating above 6)
I am unfortuantely someone that ate there
First of all if you cannot get mac and cheese right then close the doors
And what is the deal with the wonder bread instead of real bread
The ribs were sub par
The only thing I liked was the onion rings
Message to Danny - Stick with New American food
This bbq restaurant is a one of a kind in NYC
The food is consistantly great, but the wait is often long and the noise is often deafening
Go on a weeknight, when it's a little quieter
High end southern BBQ joint
Great bar with a terrific selection of regional and foreign beers and an extensive menu of bourbons and cordials
Congenial bar and wait staff

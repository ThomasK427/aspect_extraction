Sushi Gari  Keep up the great work NOBU!  God bless the FDNY!
Wonderful sake, wonderful service! The wait staff is very helpful, taking the time to help a star-struck young couple at Nobu for the very first time
The sashimi salad is a must have, and so is the kobe beef
Can't wait to go back and do it all again!
I would never normally order cod at a restaurant, but at Nobu it might be the best fish I've ever had
The Rock Shrimp tempura is unreal too
I had many business lunches this summer and this was one of the only places to which I would return with my own credit card in hand
Wonderful, inventive, but perfectly matched, concoctions
Excellent variety and, for New York and for the amount of food you get, reasonably priced omakase
The Bento Box dessert is sublime
Don't get the sushi here since you can get better elsewhere, but more importantly, because there is too much else that is unparalleled in this city
Nobu is an experience - theatrical and culinary
The decor is stunning with an Asian rock wall, seats resting on what look like chopsticks; nothing has been spared
It's large and always full despite the horrendously expensive menu
My son and I shared an omikasi special for $150 and left starving
Even ordering ala carte, it's hard to feel you're getting your money's worth
It's truly a special occasion meal for most anyone who's not a mogul
The food, however, is inventive and intriguing
Nobu is a genius
dont be taken in because the star's eat here
food and presentation are excellent
people watching is fun but overall I'm sure you are all content with your local sushi place that yes does serve fresh sushi, go for a drink but not a $20
00 roll
trust me you will never get a reservation anyway
go where they know your name and treat you like a person
we had the best sushi ever
The food was superb and the presentation beutifull
My boyfriend took me to Nobu last night for my birthday
The food and the service was amazing
I highly reccomend the tuna tempura and the passion fruit cocktail
I love this place, but I usually have to con people into paying for me
Go with whatever the waiter tells you to and enjoy a wonderful date
I highly reccomend ordering the OMAKSE (Chef's choice) after a brief interview of your wallet (starts at $70/pp) and your dinning tastes the most unbeliveable array of dishes begins to arrive at your table
My favorites included sashimi salad and the black cod
Quite simply I did not know food could be this good
Ive been to NOBU a couple of times and I really have loved it each time
There really isnt any comparison in the city
The food is pretty innovative and sooo good
I think everyone should go at least once
is the only way I can describe my thoughts about this restaurant
I can't go to any other place since I came here almost a year ago
The staff and amazingly nice host (Neil) are excellent
The food is of course, heavenly
Dinner for 4 is not all that expensive since it is a sharing type of restaurant
My favorites: Yellowtail with Jalepeno, Tiradito, Rock Shrimp with creamy sauce, Monkfish Pate and of course Black Cod miso
If you live in NYC you must try it! And don't always believe people when they say it's the MOST expensive restaurant in NYC! It's not- it's just the most satisfying!
Hands down Nobu is the best sushi I have ever had
I highly recommend the yellowtail appetizer and the rock tempura shrimp in the heavenly creamy spicy sauce
The decor is enticing and the service is always friendly
Nobu has the best Japanese food in New York bar none
My favorite is the black cod which is off the charts
Also if you want to star gaze Nobu is the place to be
It is infested with celebrities
I recommend Nobu to all the fella's trying to impress a girl on a first date, but bring your money because it will cost you a bundle
Was for lunch
Nice decor in that tres Tribeca style
Servers ranged from friendly to spacey, but none were rude
While service wasn't bad, they do need to brush up: (1) had ask for water glass to be refilled 3 times before it was done
(2) Sushi was served without soy or soy dishes, so had to wait 5 minutes until someone came by/noticed
(3) Soy sauce and rice dropped on table not wiped off before being given our dessert course
Foodwise, we liked our generously-sized portions in the $24 lunch offerings
Fish was fresh and tasty
Rolls were well made
However, nothing was outstanding or memorable other than the salad dressing and the Rising Sun cocktail
I would be interested in coming back for omikase to see if that's what earns this place its high praise
I am not raving about this place --- yet
By reputation and word of mouth, Nobu's food was truly excellent
However, our busboy's (the one dressed all in black) service was truly horrible for one of New York's finest restaurant
He kept rushing us to finish the last piece on every dish, threatening to take it away every 2 minutes even after we had told him that we were going to finish everything
Our seating was at 9:30pm and by 10:15pm, he started to rush us -- shouldn't we be given 2 hours for a dinner, especially with a party of 7? Needless to say, our dinner ended on a sour note
Even the excellent food can't replace our opinion of Nobu
Before I went to Nobu for a Restaurant Week lunch, I was told not to order the sushi -- not because it wasn't excellent, but because 1) it's harder for a relatively untrained palate to appreciate the difference between good and excellen sushi than to savor a really well-prepared seafood entree and 2) the servings of sushi are small
So I ordered the salmon with pepper sauce -- no regrets
It was not only absolutely luscious, but there was an insane amount of it--easily enough to take home if my fellow diners hadn't helped polish it off (yes, they ordered sushi)
So
while I still must try the world-renowned sushi, I had a fantastic experience nonetheless -- and the tempura was fabulous
Maybe it was because we went during the restaurant week lunch special, but the service was not impressive at all and the food was okay, but not great
I had the salmon which was excellent, but my friends had the sushi with which they were not impressed
They were better off ordering lunch from the regular menu
I would suggest to go with a group at night time where you can get the real dining experience and better appreciate the restaurant's ambience
Although Nobu is hardly a value, some very good food is available
The shrimp tempura and the tuna tartare are stand-outs
Some of the items are fairly lackluster, however, and the sushi, while good, is not a good value
We tried the omakase
Every item was at least well done, and some were very impressive indeed
Definitely a great place for Sushi and Sashimi lover
The food is excellent, and service is friendly, maybe a bit slow for typical New Yorker
Avoid ordering the usual Sashimi combo, since theyre about the same as everywhere else
Try some of the chiefs special and the new style sashimi
Believe me, theyre really worth the price
Dont compare them to those $24

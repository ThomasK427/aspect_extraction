I have had better
We sat at the bar so the service wasn't too bad
we got our sushi quickly, but it took forever to get water
and we ordered sake
WHO SERVES SAKE IN 2 LARGE TUMBLER GLASSES W/ A FEW PIECES OF CUCUMBER?????? It was horrible
We are never going back
When we ate there the food was amongst the best sushi ever
But the waitresses had too many tables, were rushed (she couldn't wait for my friend and my order and left mid sentence),plain rude, and the food took almost an hour
Ambiance; ok some of the tapestries look more Peruvian than Japanese
Don't go unless for are not hungry at the time because the wait will make you starve
P
S
The manager does not care about customer input
I like the Colbeh branch located in Great Neck on off nights
Try not to go there on Saturday nights, because it gets too crowded
The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about Colbeh is the HUGE delicious portions! The dishes can be a little pricy (about $17-21 for kabobs w/rice), but they are worth it
The best deal when ordering kabobs for two people is to order the combination platter
Each is less than $40 and you save a few bucks
You can also order the many different kinds of stews served over rice
D-licious! The staff is generally friendly and attentive
If you want authentic Persian cuisine, try Colbeh in Great Neck located a block away from the LIRR
Besides the reservation being honored within 20 minutes and the bartender being a nice guy, this is not the place to drop a lot of cash
The appetizer shrimp diavolo tasted like sweet sour not spicy
For the entree, we went with the traditonal Porterhouse and it was great but we had to pour our own wine(even the first glass)! Also, it's in need of some updates in the decor
While the specialty here is shishkabobs, the falafal is some of the best around! This place is short on atmosphere, but makes up for it in good food
It's frequently crowded, but the food is worth waiting for
Thank goodness we were guests of someone who treated us
Sure this place is famous, but be prepared to part with some serious cash to eat here
I can think of plenty of other places to enjoy a great steak across the country without plunking down your kid's college fund for a dinner
And here I thought I was going to have the best steak in the whole world! WOW, what a dissapointment! The only good thing about the restaurant is their waitstaff, very exceptional, there are about 4-5 waiters/busboys for each table
Please, heed my warning, do not go, save your money and grill your steak at home, you will enjoy it much better
I have heard for a while about peter lugar's and ultimately a friend of mine finally took me out
It was a great experience
Excellent service
I don't know if it's the best steak in NY
I have had comparable and maybe even better
But it was real good
Excellent appetizers
The bacon and onion was amazing
Must try
I had high expectations for Peter Luger
After having top notch experiences at Ruths Chris and Old Homestead I was ready for a delicious steak
The menu was disappointing as there is only one selection of steak
Cooking a steak is very important
Rare means a cold center
Medium rare means a pink cool center
After ordering steaks accordingly at other steak houses I ordered medium rare at Peter Luger
The steak came out and it was most definitely medium
It was also VERY small when compared to Ruths Chris
I sent it back for a rare steak
They came back with a medium rare center and a well done outside
The steak was cooked very inconsistently
Definitely not what I would expect from a reputable steak house
The beverage menu should be expanded to include more beers and liquors
It wouldnt hurt to get an espresso and cappuccino maker
I've never had better steak outside of Peter Luger
The steak and the juices and their sauce was a good combination
I also recommend getting the tomatos and Peter Luger sauce appetizer
It's a bit pricy for the appetizer, but it tastes really good
I think everyone should head out to Peter Luger at least once to try good steak
This quaint restaurant is definitely a great place to go to for a nice night out- whether it is for a date, to catch up with friends, or family reunion
It has a wonderful selection of dishes- it is not your ordinary Italian restaurant
It has a unique and tasteful selection
Not to mention the attentive and personable staff
After moving to queeens from manhattan
I thought my sushi days would be coming to an end b/c there is no good sushi in between nyc and the hamptons right? EHHHHH! Wrong! To our surprise
and I mean surprise
this place has incredibly fresh sushi with aewsome presentation
My friends said that the kitchen food was equally to task
Definately worth the trip
we will be returning
You don't have to go into the city for great Thai food; just go to Great Neck
I've had chicken, duck and vegetarian dishes here that were all very, very good
But my favorite is the Tom Kha Gai soup (coconut, lemon grass and chicken) and the traditional Pad Thai noodles
It's never crowded
I actually would love for more people to discover this gem so that it will stay in business
A nice and quiet restaurant with absolutely delicious food
Quite the selection in delectable dishes ranging from Pad Thai Noodles, which is a very popular item on the menu, to Kang Kari, an authentic thai dish which tasted similar to what I had in Thailand!
I love this quaint, little Italian restaurant
It's intimate setting is perfect for dates but is equally suited to family gatherings
The waitstaff make you feel like you're part of their family, especially the ever pleasant hostess
The decor and menu are fun without being kitschy and the food is consistently good
I expected more from Vespa based on the Zagat guide, but the whole experience was truly mediocre
One of my tests for a good Italian restaurant is the Caprese salad
In this case, the tomatoes were not very red or ripe, and the mozzarella was second rate
I went to to this place on two occasions, each time hoping for a better experience
Both times, however, I endured lazy service, old bread, overcooked pasta and sour wine w/my meal
The waiters there are not attentive and the manager/owner, unless he knows you, has I am doing you a favor face when, and if, he comes to your table
Amazingly, he is at your service in half a second when it's time to collect the check and throw you a pityfull ciao when you're done being ripped off
Great Place
Food is original, Service is very attentive, they make you feel like family
Decor is funky, cool, makes me feel like I am back in Rome
A great city feel, for a spot on Long Island
As someone from the southwest, I have pretty high standards for Mexican food, and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food here
Atmostphere is fun; kids are welcome, and they even have crayons that kids can use on the brown paper table coverings while waiting for meals
My one complaint is that it is overpriced for a casual Mexican restaurant
I love Scottos, delicious!! Penne ala vodka, Chicken Parm hero, Caesar salad and you're all set
Something happened in the past month, and I don't like it
They changed the Menu
The food always left you with a great feeling, but I guess it could not last forever

Staff were rude, they claimed that the customers before us were 'taking their time' so took 45 mins to sit us, we found out later that it wasn't the customers, it was the service
It was another 30 mins before they took our order, the seating staff asked us if we had paid yet before we even got our entrees!! Never again
Really
I live in the neighbourhood and have grown up with this sort of food in 23 years living in the Far East
To be blunt, it's fake food for Westerners
I've tasted the menu, item by item, since they're in the neighbourhood and *NOTHING* comes up to snuff: Its Char Kway Teow is a joke
And the less I say about its Rendang, the better
The Pandan Leaf ChickenWings are so dessicated as to be mummified
The best thing they have is the Poh Piah, which isn't that good
If I'm in the mood for this sort of food, I'd rather take a cab down to the Chinatown branch of this restaurant (which actually seems to know what they're doing)
Authentic, this place ain't
Considering its location in my neighbourhood, I'm even willing to pay premium prices if they'd had authentic cuisine
But they don't
Having not been to Penang in quite some time, I receommended it recently for a friends birthday
For a large group I remember it being aplace that had big tables and inexpensive food
The night was a disaster
It toook 20 minutes to get a busboy to bring us water and another 20 for someone to take our order
After waiting at least another half hour, our food was then brought out one item at a time
This includes one soup, then one fried calamri and so on
Most of the food was inedible
The scallops had sand in them and the duck had bones! Never waste your time or money with this place!
We finally decided to try this place, due to its decor and outside seating
The food was excellent, but, as others have pointed out, the service was terribly slow
It appears that they need a waitstaff captain or something
perhaps it is something in the kitchen, but they seemed completely disorganized
One of us would get food, while the other dish would come 5 minutes later
The outside seating was great for people watching
The food was very good and an average value
However, please be ready for slow, disorganized waitstaff
The restaurant drew me in because it is dark and well designed
However, my first experience was terrible
The food was less than average, the service was slow and the utensils were filthy (rice between the prongs of the forks)
But, I went pretty late so I decided to give it another chance
TERRIBLE
I went again last Thurs at 9pm
The place was about 2/3 full
We were seated promptly enough after the waitress literally pushed past an elderly man while he was trying to up from his table (he looked shocked!)
However, after we were seated, we waited for over 15 minutes for a waitperson to take our orders or at least bring us water
No one waited on us even after we tried to flag waitstaff down
This seemed to be a problem for several other tables
After the wait, we finally left
Never again
Come sit outside to people watch
The chairs are a little uncomfortable, but you'll forget about them once the food arrives
I had the penang sald with mangoes and shrimp
We also had the steamed vegetable spring roll
ALl for a good price
The food was excellent as well as the selection
Our service was also good explaining every dish we has questions about
I love Penang
When I was living in Boston it was my favorite place for affordable eats
I have since been to the one in the East Village and most recently, the one on the UES
Wow, was I disappointed! It's like they don't share recipes with their sister restaurants or something
Malaysian Ice Tea was watery and not creamy, Roti Canai was salty and not spicy, and Mee Goreng was swimming in too much sauce
I'm going to see if the original SoHo location tastes better
Nice decor in the UES one though
I have to say that the food in Penang is very good
The only problem I have with this restaurant (the 83d Street Location) is the service
It is completely terrible and not very accommodating
Considering the state of the economy, the host at this restaurant was rude and not pleasant
I arrived on time for my reservation for 7, however my party (of 7 people) had not yet arrived
The Host said he was unable to seat us without our entire party
When my party finally arrived, 30 minutes late due to parking problems, the host said he could not sit us in a dome ( seating for parties more then 6 people) because we were late, and proceeded to seat us at a table fit for 4
After explaining to him the situation, he refused to give us larger accomodations and sat us in a small corner
The Malaysian cuisine at Penang is very good
I have eaten here several times over the past several years
I have also eaten in their other locations
I highly recommend the appetizer, Sotong Goreng - spicy fried squid
It is excellent
This place is awesome! Dishes are extremely tasty, as spicy as you want it, and definately worth the money, albeit a touch on the pricey side
Atmosphere is cosy but not romantic and a little on the rowdy side late at night
They're open till 1 am so if you cant find anywhere else to eat, you know you can always rely on Penang
Excellent food, good atmosphere and service but a little pricey
Dinner for 2 including 4 drinks was $63
It was worth it though
Will recommend to friends
My personal favorite, this malalysian-asian exotic cuisine cannot fail anyone with true taste buds and a desire to experience a real flavor of the east! try the yummy shrimp in black sauce, the mango chicken, or thai curry dishes, whatever treats your palate and all of them will be promising! Do not forget to start your meal with a little dip of roti canai! The upper east side location is quite marvelous and a great place to celebrate an occassion over excellent cuisine!
My friends and I went to the Penang on the upper east side
The coconut Martini's were great
The ambiance was unique with the two private barrels for large parties
But, more importantly they served food that did not disappoint
The service was friendly and helpful with menu
I would suggest the Roti Canni
My husband and I went to Heidelberg last night for dinner
The food were good but not great
The service was average - the waiter did not check in on our meals and did not even refill the water, but was a bit pushy on desert (we both ordered schnapps)
When the bill came, we were shocked to find an over 20% tips on it
Displeased, but we didn't want to make a fuss on a Saturday evening so we paid the bill
On the way out, I inquired about the 'practice' or 'policy' of adding tips to bills
The hostess was visibly embarrassed and said they only do this for big tables of over 6 people, which is common in New York
I told her we already paid up and gracefully left
I'm not sure we'd go back again because of the sleazy waiter
It's a shame, really
On a recent visit to NY we were looking for a German restuarant I used to enjoy on 86th Street when visiting my sister in Hoboken all too many years ago
Disappointed that it has since disappeared, we discovered the Heidelberg just around the corner and enjoyed a great lunch
The food was very good, the service was prompt and very friendly (potatoe pancakes were excellent) and of course the beer selection was outstanding
It's sad that it appears to be the last German restuarant in Yorkville and it makes me wish I lived in NY (among many other reasons) to help keep it viable
My friends and I love Heidelberg so much that we've created a tradition of German Feast each time we gather there
The huge list of German beers, the quaint and cramped ambience, the comical staff dressed in lederhosen, and the authentic German food makes dining at this restaurant a true experience
Portions are large and the platters for two or three more than enough food to share

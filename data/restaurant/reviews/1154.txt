Come here and expect to be seated and served by a waitress
The food is amazing
their beers are 5 dollars and wine is 5 dollars too
Great pizza and a great value
You won't be disappointed!
WHEN YOU WALK IN YOU SEE A MAGNIFICENT WOODBURNING BRICK OVEN
THE LIGHTING IS ALL HANDBLOWN GLASS, I AM TOLD THAT THE OWNER MICHAEL AYOUB MADE THEM
THEY HAVE A GREENHOUSE IN THE BACK FOR HERBS
THE PIZZA WAS THE BEST I HAVE EVER TASTED AND THE SELECTION OF 25 PIZZA IS UNPARELLELED
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES PIZZA
BEING STEPS FROM THE L TRAIN MAKES IT VERY CONVENIENT
This is our favorite place for date night
Even with the thousands of restaurants in the city, this is where we keep coming back to
The Beatles are always playing, the staff is always friendly and the food is always amazing
The atmosphere is great for promoting a little romance
Back in November this is where we got engaged!!
The Margherita [Extra] pizzas are deceptively simple and cheap
Three toppings (fresh mozzerella, basil tomato) and a thin crust are perfectly balanced, leaving those who taste it craving more
It's even great warmed up in the oven the next day
It is very nearly the perfect pizza
Also delicious is the 4 Stagioni, which combines fresh mozzerella, prosciutto, mushrooms, eggplant and kalamata olives
The only thing I would suggest is that its creators cut the olives in half so that they don't roll off the pizza
I've also tried the Rustica, which was good, except I didn't love the Guanciale (bacon)
A word to the wise: Order the larger version of the pizza
The small version serves one person easily, but for only $2 more, you can serve 2-3
They also deliver
quickly
This place was just a little small but the food was great
Service was amazing
The menu has plenty of choices and they will make the pizze however you would like
Not a great place for groups but a perfect place for a date
This place is a real treasure
the pizza is just amazingly Italian - thin crunchy crust and the finest ingredients
What adds to the place is the attentive service and the fantastic value
Go for it
The Scene Beige banquettes, dark blue accents and a ribbed ceiling set a seafaring tone; round fixtures and copper accents further the cruise-ship vibe
The space draws a similarly showy crowd
The attractive staff looks good, but can be stretched too thin
The Food It's a modern take on the old, big-time seafood house
Mom can have her shrimp cocktail and Dad can dig into a heavenly bowl of clam chowder, bearing tender whole clams and bits of bacon
Both can enjoy treats from the sushi bar
Trendier palates will swoon over gorgeous strips of raw black bass topped with shredded jicama, ginger and plum-wine gelee; red snapper with a martini-like topping of olives, lime and red-chili flakes; and foie gras and tuna, skewered and topped with pineapple
Among the entrees, best is the swordfish, sliced atop sweet roasted tomatoes and drizzled with soy-ginger marinade
Great experience -- feels like you are on an exotic cruise
Amazing decor - a must see, excellent service and very tasty seafood
A friend took me here for my birthday recently, and the sushi was terrific
I especially loved the house roll of soft-shell crab
Additionally, our waiter was the nicest guy
Yummy, warm mixed berry crumble with vanilla ice cream for dessert and a round of drinks on the house! I definitely want to go back and try the ice cream sandwiches and lemon terrine
Was very surprised!! The new Lure was a completely different experience then before
The menu had more selections, price points that fit all our budgets and a new Sushi menu that went over huge with the table
Our group wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly shocked and surprised
Very helpful service staff to boot!! Will be back for hopefully many more memorable meals
Honestly, the whole boat theme is a little tacky
It was interesting to sit below street level, but I could have done without the decor
The food was actually quite good
However, the service was poor and the portions wouldn't satisfy anyone who isn't on a diet
Overall, just not worth the hype/price
I work in a service industry and eat out between 3 and 5 times a week on a corperate budget
the service was fine and the decor is nice
however, there was 10 of us, and all 10 went for pizza after the meal
Appitizers($20 each)were no larger than a cubic centimeter (no exageration)
my $40+ entree was literally a 5oz piece of fish on a stark white plate,nothing else (not even a garnish) i left starving! each of us had a glass of wine, an appitizer, and an entree,it was $95 a head (before pizza)
i must admit, what little food there was to eat tasted pretty good, not great but good
overall it was expensive and frustrating, i hate leaving an expensive meal hungry! even my wife (105 lbs) was hungry when we left
conversly the pizza place down the street was delicious, cheap, and filling
The fish was absolutely phenomenal
Two of us went, and we both had the grilled swordfish, and it was simply amazing
The wine list, while comprehensive, it way overpriced (I believe the cheapest bottles started at $52, which is high even for Manhattan)
The food was slightly overpriced considering the portion sizes, but the preparation and taste is to die for
The theme of the restaurant makes you feel like you're on a boat, it's a definite change from the ordinary manhattan restaurant
Contrary to other reviews, the service was ok
Nothing extraordinary, but not terrible
The restaurant is ideal for large parties, they don't have a lot of tables for two
The bar area looked very nice also, and it was quite full
I love the 'lower than street level' setting
The windows act as portholes as if one was on a gigantic cruise ship
The interior design was very well planned
Fun cocktails, an excellent wine list and innovative food, what more could you ask for from a restaurant in SoHo? The food and service was stellar
The Scene With table seating for just 14 inside (there's an enclosed back patio area with additional seating) and a bar that fits about eight, this softly lit, wood-lined jewel box of a place emanates a cozy warmth and a get-to-know-your-neighbor charm
Service is rushed yet friendly, always taking the time to check in and chat
The Food Chef Patricio Sandoval starts with the building blocks of authentic Mexican cuisine and adds his own flair
That means the just-mashed guacamole is brightened with little bits of mint and pineapple, and that shrimp seviche arrives in an addictive chili-coconut milk and lime juice bath
Tacos, including tender ancho-guajillo-rubbed pork and rosemary-marinated chicken with corn, come three to a plate and are perfect for sharing
Don't leave without ordering Sandoval's outstanding baked oysters, which arrive in their shell topped with a bit of manchego cheese and homemade chorizo
Great food, abominable service
Nothing's worse than having a fine meal, getting slightly tipsy on yummy margaritas, and then waiting 45 minutes for a check
It destroys the buzz! First, they told us that the system was down
Then, the manager finally arrived to fix it and he said we are so backed up! -- a lie
When you charge so much for those tiny tacos (even if they are good) you should be able to produce a check and get the machine to charge someone's credit card
I mean isn't that an important part to running a restaurant -- taking the customer's money!?
The only thing that was worth eating was their guacamole
The margaritas and service were pretty bad
If you decide to visit El Mercadito, I would recommend checking your bill before you pay
They tried to overcharge me twice - first when I paid for the drinks and then when I paid for the food
In addition, the back room is extremely loud making it very difficult to have a conversation
My suggestion: Go to a more authentic restaurant and enjoy better service and a nicer meal
Mercadito has to be one of the best restaurants in the city
The service was excellent and the food and drink was just as good
If you like Sangria, try the white wine Sangria

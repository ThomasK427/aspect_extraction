My guests had a great time too
This out of the way restaurant is a hidden gem in Midtown
Pulse is located inside the Sports Club/LA in Rockefeller Center and provided a beautiful view of the ice rink over dinner one night this Holiday season
The service was personal and professional, yet the food was out of this world, have the dumplings and don't be affraid to ask questions about the food the staff are very knowledgable
I'll be back again to sample this Chef's specials soon!
The meal I ate at Pulse was one of the best I have ever eaten in New York
The food was beautifully presented and equally tasty
The ambiance was comfortable yet refined and the staff friendly and knowledgeable
Everyting I ate there was incredible from the Tseukune (chicken dumplings) to the black bass special, right down to the velety chocolate pudding I had for dessert
Truly an experience I would like to live over and over again
I can't wait until next time!
Wow, I can't believe I never knew Pulse was there
first off, what an amazing view
And a very soft and elegant atmosphere, without the stuffiness
It overlooks Rockefeller Center, and I can imagine what it's like at Christmas time when the tree is lit up
The food was amazing and surprisingly affordable
Very creative dishes, and healthy too
I'd classify it as Asian-Fusion
I suggest the seared tuna with the miso dressing
Pulse, with a perch overlooking Rockefeller Center from inside the SportsClub LA, was terrific when I went with friends
It's perfect for a light gourmet lunch
The dumplings, noodles and Asian greens hit the spot, and the sake grilled short ribs melt in your mouth - I had to restrain myself from ordering a second plate
My friend had the panini and it was also excellent - a simple black forest ham and harvarti cheese with tons of flavor, perfectly crisp
The views were really spectacular, I can't wait to go back at night
Pulse serves spa cuisine - low fat, low carb, high protein - next to a health club in the Rockerfellar Center
My short ribs satey entree was decent and well prepared but the gazpacho was awful
My friend's noodle dish was bland and tasteless
The salad was boring and uninventive
Service was decent but the place was hardly packed during our lunch there
This is definitely not a place to come for lunch because you can get the same food from a corner deli at half the price they charge here
The food is good but nothing spectacular
It's great for brunch or lunch
Nice place for first dates because it's not TOO romantic yet it's a comfy place
The writers of the kitchenette menu had a knack for making the dishes sound really tasty, if perhaps a little exaggerated
The food was pretty good, but nothing to write home about
My tex mex eggs tasted a lot better than they looked (thank goodness! UGLY!) and my sister's peach crepes were flavorful, if overly chewy
The dining room is very crowded, with precious little space between different parties, which can be awkward
We were also unimpressed by how ridiculously loud it seemed
We asked to be reseated in a quieter area, but by the time our lackadaisical waiter got around to move us, we decided it was no longer worth the bother
I went here last Sunday for brunch for the first time
It was very good
I had the Berry pancakes with the turkey sausage
The decor was cute it had a rustic like theme
You will see alot of Columbia University students there
I recommend everyone to try it
I was even lucky enough to find a parking space around the corner but it is hard to determine whether or not parking is always easy to find
When I first came for dinner I was a bit weary with my  girlfriends decision to dine there; however, after one taste of their turkey meatloaf and mac cheese I knew we made the right decision
The night crowd at the restaurant isn't too big which makes for better  service
Their wine and beer menu is pretty good and their desserts excellent
My wife and I went on Easter for brunch and maybe the regular cooks were out that morning or something
We both ordered the waffle special, which was expensive for a waffle
One was as dry and tasteless as cardboard (really, cardboard is a good comparision) and the other equally tasteless but undercooked, so it was more like soggy cardboard
The butter didn't help because they didn't give us any
Nice little place though
I went to Kitchenette this weekend for brunch
The place is absolutely adorable and the food is delicious
However, the service is absolutely horrible
Since the place is really tiny they have tables of two pushed together so you are basically sitting next to strangers
My party ordered before the party sitting next to us and not only did they get their food first but they also ate their food and received their check before the food for my table arrived
When I asked the waitress she told me it was because I ordered pancakes
it's pancakes - not steak so I didn't understand and I told the waitress just that
From beginning to end the staff was RUDE
We were completely ignored, at least 6 other parties were seated before us with the same number as us and without reservation
When asked to explain the hostess told us she would lose money by seating us instead of them
The manager and hostess both raised their voices pointed their fingers in our face
It was completely uncalled for, and completely surprising given that we were not causing trouble and were a potentially large party
On previous experiences there I had encountered milder forms of rudeness, and subpar 'homestyle'
If you're going uptown go to Amy Ruths, Spoonbread, or Sylvia's
this place is not worth the hassle
I attend Teacher's College at Columbia University part-time
I was looking for a restaurant for dinner before my once-a-month evening class
After learning about Kitchenette Uptown on CitySearch, I went for dinner last night
All I can say is WOW! It is a cute, fun little place that smells like the kitchen you WISH your mom had!   I had an early dinner special -- the Four Cheese Macaroni with a large mesclun-style salad for $13
The Macaroni was TO DIE FOR -- every bite from beginning to end was delicious and satisfying
The salad was LARGE and very tasty!   I had to splurge and get dessert -- the homemade chocolate pudding was bliss -- the deep cocoa flavor was so luscious!  I will DEFINITELY return to Kitchenette Uptown anytime I am up at Columbia
I can't wait to try one of their breakfasts, too!
It was a bit crowded but I didn't mind because it felt comfortable and relaxing
I loved the homemade chilli and definitely recommend the lemon squares! The waitors were quick with orders,very attentive and friendly
I would definitely go back for the brunch and dessert!
and was never very happy when she was in the kitchen
I think everyone in Kitchenette feels the same way
It is cute but the food is only average, it's expensive and rarely comes up to the expectations raised by the descriptions
The butter and jam comes in tiny little paper cups
The service is either clueless or surly or both
Worst of all - the biscuits are leaden! Who ever heard of toasting fresh biscuits?
The wait staff and manager are rude and terribly inefficient
I observed this behavior with other patrons and experienced it first hand
The food definitely does not make up for the POOR, POOR, service
This place only feels like the home of a dysfunctional family
There are many better options in the neighborhood and I suggest you take your money and your friends elsewhere
I have to admit that I was a little underwhelmed the one time I went to Kitchenette Uptown for dinner, but brunch was a totally different story! The plates are generous and tasty, with nice little twists on traditional brunch fare and it's a lovely, bright room to chat with a friend and enjoy a weekend morning, or afternoon
I don't really understand why some people like to eat here so much
The place itself looks adorable, and the food and desserts look delicious, too
But the two meals I had there were rather bland, and there are definitely better dessert places in the area
This place has the rigfht idea- great homestyle kitchen ambience with an adorable counter and bakery display, unfortunately they fell into everything that stinks about New York- AN OVERPRICED Menu with way little bang for the buck- In momma's kitchen you want big portions and tasty homestyle favorites with some upscale twists- the portions instead are tiny and unsatisfying, the service is slow, and while stuff sounds special- this is far from the truth- not to mention ingredients that weren't fresh- the fruit salad was mush and the bagel was stale!
This place reminds me of being in Mom's kitchen
Old and comfortable
Tiled floors with a Lower East Side kitchen decor
Words can't describe
You tastebuds will be in heaven! The service is great, The Chef is awsome!! The wine selection is perfect--I have been back 3X in one month since Valentines Day!  You can't miss this!

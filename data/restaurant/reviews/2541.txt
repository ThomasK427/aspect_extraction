The main thing that  prompted me to rate this restaurant was the earlier reviewer who complained about being  seated near the noisy bar
In actuality, the restaurant doesn't even have a bar
This small restaurant could be charming but the acoustics are poor; it easily gets so noisey that polite conversation is virtually impossible
The night I was there two tables were so loud that the whole restaurant went totally silent at their outlandish behavior and the owner did nothing
The owner can also be charming until the orders are taken and then he becomes increasingly aloof and preoccupied
I found that as the evening progressed, the service became very spotty and I was shocked by having to ask for a second cup of coffee and the usual complementary cookies
Though the food may be good, you can find equal quality elsewhere in much more amenable and refined atmospheres
If you like street life, this is your place
One of my top three restaurants in all of Manhattan
The food is incredible- fresh ingredients, highest quality, and they always have amazing specials
The proprietor is extremely charming and the staff is attentive and lovely
Highly recommended for a special experience
Probably among the top 10 authentic Italian menus East of the Mississippi
Effecient, friendly and informed service
Engaged staff
Quality of the food and it's preparation was outstanding
Some of the best mussels, osso bucco and rabbit we've had in decades
A bit pricey but well worth every cent
We wish we knew it existed when we lived in the city
As a dining experience probally rates as the best food in the world
Wine list is exceptional, food is of the highest quality and service is very good
Restaurant owner personally oversees every part of the operation as is always on the premises
Primavera is one of my favorite Resturantes in New York
I eat here all the time
I tell all my freiends who have never been there that they must go! The beutiful dinning room with it's lush use of wood and soft ligthing makes you feel like you are eating in a park ave living room
The white glove service is the best i have ever seen in New York and the food speaks for it's self, Mouth Watering! Wether with a date or a large party i never felt cramped or over powered by the other dinners
I am looking forward to coming back a soon as i can and sharing my experience with many more of my friends
First time there, they made me feel like a long-time regular
Every person, down to the pepper guy, was extremely nice and charismatic
Perfect atmosphere for the classy experience
Food was expensive, but for once I felt like I got my money's worth, which is another way of saying the food is extraordinary
I frequent Arthur Ave
in the Bronx and the fresh mozzarella at this restaurant (Primavera Antipasto appetizer) was so good it felt like I was eating dessert first
This has been a favorite in my family for generations! Growing up in NYC, my parents have been taking my sister and I there since we were young girls and the tradition continues more than 25 years later
Nicola, the restaurant's owner and Maitre D, pours his heart and soul into the place, which is easily apparent by the restaurant's consistently excellent food and impeccable service
When you walk in, Nicola greets you with a warm smile, and from that moment on will do everything to ensure your food and service meet your every expectation, however the chef and wait staff need no assistance in these areas as the food and service are of the highest caliber rarely found these days in NYC restaurants
Don't miss this place!!
I am extremely biased toward this place because Joe Montana came over to our table after we sent him a drink
He introduced himself and shook all our hands and thanked us all
He was a perfect gentlmen, just as you would expect the Future Hall of Famer to be
As for the food, it was very good, the sevice was even better and the ambience was terrific
The Scene With a flaming red awning stretching almost the entire length of its block, it's hard to miss this place
Inside, the look and feel is a little corporate, but the staff is aggressive in its companionable attention
The restaurant is essentially designed for large groups; couples and small parties may feel outgunned
The Food The menu lists the usual Italian-American roster of deep-fried appetizers, saucy pastas and oversized slabs of meat
Portions are mammoth, and that's the attraction
Linguine, soaked in the ultra-sweet house marinara and dotted with seafood, is fine but unexciting
Ziti Bolognese is baked in a similar sauce, with ground meat mixed in and cheese melted on top--the menu offers many variations on this theme
"Tony's famous" pair of sirloin steaks are broiled with an herb dressing; these are good steaks, expertly cooked, but overwhelmed with salt and oil
Desserts are colossal and fairly dull
I have been to Tony's with 2 or three people a number of times, and I've also hosted a large surprise party here
Every experience is New York to the teeth-good food and a good time
The party was incredible
Phenomenal, beautifully presented food in the usual quantities and service that would have done justice to a 4 star hotel
( I've worked for a number of them so I feel qualified to determine what good service means)
I tip my hat to Tony's
I love italian food an all but they had bad service
I'mnot sure, maybe the guy was new but he totallyforgot about me and my friends
I dont really like the atmosphere though
Tony's is just a wonderful place to have a great meal, especially if you are a tourist, and want a big NY meal
It's classic, family Italian food (I grew up with the classic big Italian family), located in Midtown, close to Times Square
If you want an intimate, candle-lit dinner for two, this is not your place
Otherwise, you really cannot go wrong here
I stop at Tony's every time I'm in New York on business
Special Tip: Like any Manhattan restaurant, it fills up quickly
The best spot if you are by yourself or just with one other person is to cozy up to the bar and eat your meal there
Full menu available, great bartenders and friendly crew
Have the spaghetti with house marina and a side of meatballs, washed down with a nice Merlot or a couple of Peroni's
it gets no better!
I made reservations for Valentines 2006
Alot of food
Great tasting Food
Best of All Inexpensive!
When you go to Tony's, instead of fare like chicken parmigiana and penne ala vodka, opt for their gorgeous steaks which can be sliced and easily shared, and anything with seafood
Their lobster is one of the best values in Manhattan
Also, I was pleasantly suprised to find such an in depth wine list, bth in quality and value
Our waiter told us he knew all the wines on it quite well, and he did! We went with his reccomendation and and were pleased beynd belief!!
I've lived in this neighborhood for years and know to avoid this place
However, I was in two circumstances with friends where I ate here in the last two months
The food is awfully bland and a disgrace to Italian cuisine
If forced, your best bet is the eggplant and sausage peppers
The wine list and pasta are the WORST in NYC! The service is incompetent
Each time, they forgot to bring out 2 dishes, yet they were on the bill, and one time brought us out dishes we didn't order
At least they were apologetic about the bill and fixed it with no hassle
They're also ill-knowledgable about wine and cuisine
There is also an overwhelming BT presence
What an exceptional way to end my last night in New York
The food is exceptional, the service was excellent
Where else in New York can you stop in without reservations and get a table for six within minutes? Hat's off to our waiter - I think he enjoyed our East Tennessee hospitality:) Highly recommend for tourists it will be an experience you want soon forget
good service, and very good food
We went when it wasn't busy, would like to see if the place is as good when they are crowded
organized a dinner for a group of 12 people with kids
average food, good service and lively atmosphere
be careful with the food order, the portions are huge
Went there on a busy night
We felt like cows with the cowboy waiters moving us in out as soon as possible
It seemed that the chef was in a big hurry too, because our salad came with our entrees, AT THE SAME TIME !! I don't know, people tell me good things about this place, but it was such a bad experience that I don't think I'll be back for another round
well, if you ever find youself in a position where you have to get a table for like 16 people the night before, try tony's
the food is average, the place is loud, but i mean
where else can you get a table that large the night before in nyc?

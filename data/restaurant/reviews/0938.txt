Went to Pacifico last night, expecting at least moderately decent food
Was highly dissapointed-- Sangria reeked of cheap wine, my beef taco was askew with fat, and the enchilada left much to be desired
Service was decent to goood, but couldnt make up for the food
Glanced around, and realized most people were there to patronize the bar
Guess we should have taken note of that and not ordered the food


One plus, the atmosphere is great
The food and ambience at Pacifico are wonderful
and the margaritas and fish tacos some of the best in the area
That being said, the service and general attitude of the staff make this experience less than pleasurable
I live locally and have been to Pacifico half a dozen times, more often than not
the host and wait staff are unfriendly and unaccommodating to their customers
There's nothing worse than a NYC attitude in friendly Brooklyn!
I have lived in Brooklyn for years and I have never experienced such poor service on a consistent basis from a local restaurant
You will be guaranteed an extremely rude host and the staff is no better
I have visited numerous times and received horrible service
The most recent quote from a waitress when asked if she could make a minor food substitution for a child was we can, but we won't
Well, I can and I will chose another restaurant
I'll send the poor attitudes back and I'll have my final check!
Wow this place got beat up pretty bad in reviews (could it be rival restaurant owners?) We are pretty savy downtown bk restaurant go-ers
But our experience there was good, but come to think of it, the wait staff was a bit slow and confused (we had the time to spare) , and people did come to the table asking erroneously if they had our food physically a nice place We'd recommend it, food choices were interesting and tasty
Unfortunately this is one of the better outdoor spaces in Brooklyn and somehow this gives the waiters (especially the nasty host) the belief that they can treat customers horribly
We came with a group of 12 people for a party and you would think that a restaurant would be happy to have the business (especially drinks) for a large group but they were so rude about seating us and when we asked for an extra chair they told us they were all taken (even though there were 2 empty tables next to us
Food is below average which you could make better at home and the margaritas are awful and watered-down
Go someplace else
We have a 9 month old baby and absolutely love this place for the family dining experience
It's true that the host is easily flustered and can't really handle the stress, but we found the wait staff at best very nice and at worst edgy and snippy
But the food, atmosphere, and price make it worth a few unpleasant moments with the host and wait staff
I have never had worse service in my life, and I AM A WAITER so I am more patient and understanding than most
If I was to list ALL the wrongs in this place I would be here for ever
So I will just give the owners one piece of what I think is obvious advice do not hire staff that pick their nose
Just one note on the food I did not think it was possible to make mexican food taste THIS bad
The good news is that it is not open 24 hours
I was also warned of bad service but we gave it a chance
Our waiter was so rude that when he brought out our order incorrectly he began to argue with us that we were wrong
While we were waiting for the food to come out another table was having their own issues and left
We actually never ate the food because we left after being yelled at by the waiter
The pizza place connected to it also suffers from a staff with bad attitudes
We were served cold pizza and told it was our fault (whatever that means) and that they didn't care if we came back
When it comes to food in bklyn word of mouth is very important!
i am updating a previous review since we just went there a week or so ago
Amazing
that it was almost empty and it took them at least ten minutes to deliver menus
They seem like pleasant folks, but come on
The drinks are great, but the food is really lacking - 5 people and we had half eaten plates and reviews of eh, it was ok i guess
I wish they'd get their act together because i want to go there and give them my money
Next time we are sitting at the bar and ordering apps
Even when the place has been packed with tables (I saw a party of 12 in there last time), the waiters and bartenders are still nice
Plus, the margaritas are fabulous, and $6!  Unlike a lot of popular places in this neighborhood, you never feel like you're putting the staff out if you ask for a menu substitution, for another pitcher of drinks, or to change a drink order
Also, the outside area stays open a long time into the fall
AND you can still smoke at the outermost area of the patio - the wait staff can't technically serve you there because of the smoking, but if you don't mind walking to the bar to place an order (I don't), it's a great solution for smokers
I have no idea how you can make Mexican food NOT tasty, but Pacifico somehow manages to do just that
I was warned against their food by previous customers but figured-how bad could it be?  Truth be told, the nacho's were edible but the um, big ass burrito was amazingly flavorless
The vegetable filling included chunks of undercooked eggplant - blech! The rice was flavorless, and bloated from overcooking
The wait service was far more attentive than that mentioned in other reviews
However, I was one of the only people there at the time
I would recommend this place if you want to have margarita's in an attractive outdoor setting
Certainly not the food
ps - is yardbird code for pigeon?
I like this place a lot
Great spot to grab some cheap mexican food and very good margaritas
I love the atmosphere but I agree with the comments about the shotty service
This place could make a lot more money if they would refill my margarita a little more often
On contrary with the previous posts, I thought the service was brilliant
Not only was the food cheap, it was also good
Highly recommend the steak fajitas and mango salsa
the margaritas are great! i love the guacamole and the ambience is excellent (in summer and winter) but PUHHLEEASE- the waitstaff needs to get over themselves
Except for one young, blond waitress, the staff here is so snotty! Argh! Also, they skimp on the hand soap there, its watered down which is just gross!
Between the huge outdoor area, the design of the indoor space, and the $5 menu items, this place has a lot of potential
But all that means nothing when considering the quality of the service
We didn't see our waiter for a solid 20 minutes after sitting down; once he did show up, he got mad when I asked a question about one of the entrees; three different waiters brought food to our table that wasn't ours; after asking for water four times, I finally got up and filled a pitcher myself
And this was happening at every table - every party on the deck was looking around, trying to find their waiter and laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation
This is NYC - there are enough other good places to eat, that I don't need to put up with that again!
Take your scarf, hat, and gloves if you plan on sitting in one of Pacifico's tables that are located inside by virtue of plastic and some heat lamps
My food was cold in a matter of 30 seconds
The food is really no better than what a 14 year-old could serve up if you told them to cook Mexican
The food is boring
Flavorless
I had the flank steak fajitas and I ate a few bites and realized it was almost not edible
Dry chewy and shrivelled up pieces of steak
Pay a few dollars more and eat at a decent place
This place is not worth it
I can't believe they fill all their tables
Pacifico is a great alternative to all the cheese and grease-drenched mexican food in the neighborhood
The ambiance is awesome; it's warm and candle-lit
Although, they ought to turn off the TV at the bar! They were nice enough to make me a simple bean, rice and cheese burrito, even though it's not on the menu (Note to Management: you should add it to the menu!)
I had a pumpkin and caramel rice pudding that was delicious
Recommended!
There was a 40 minute wait for a table, so we put our name on the list and went around the corner to get a beer
We returned 48 minutes later to be told that our table was given away
We asked if we could please get the next table, only to be told: no, we had to be put on the bottom of the list and wait another 20 minutes
She then continued: You should have told me you were leaving You should have waited at the bar and This is the way it's done at every restaurant I've worked at!   To the owner: When someone enters your restaurant, make them feel welcome! Even if we had to wait longer, the hostess' attutude and reponse was absolutely unnecessary
We ended up leaving, and will never come back!
Great food, very fresh but a little pricey (truthfully worth the $$)
The best peanut sauce I have ever tasted, tried a bunch of stuff all of it great
The restaurant is very small so take out is the best way to go
This is a well hidden jewel! The Sushi is always fresh, try the Spicy Rock Shrimp! Their ginger sauce is the best I've ever tasted
Not over priced, but sometimes a bit too crowded during lunch
The Scene The long brick-walled space resembles many Alphabet City bars, but walk past the bathrooms papered in Aussie tabloids and the open galley kitchen, and you'll find one of the city's most unusual backyards

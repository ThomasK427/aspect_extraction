The waiters are absent-minded, they dissapear endlessly, and they will screw up your order
The food is ok, but not worth the aggravation or cost
Don't bother
Perhaps it was an off night, but the sushi and sashimi were quite dissapointing - and at $230 for two, a restaurant should not have an off' night
Notwithstanding the fact that we got the omakase, the fish was not nearly as fresh as we expected - indeed, it was the opposite
Glad to have tried the place, but I'll never eat there again
This restaurant is over priced for very mediocre sushi
The ceviche was gross and the tuna and salmon sushi were below average because of the stale rice
The service was snotty and the timing of the meals were totally off!! To top it off they were practically kicking us out before we finished
They tried to make up for their horrible service by giving us free ice cream at the end, but that didn't cut it! It is packed now, but once people try it once they will never go back!!!
My husband and I went to Gari on the UWS a few weeks after it first opened
I have to say we were quite disappointed
The short rib appetizer was tough and fatty
The sushi was barely edible
We ordered some of the same items we used to have at Sushi of Gari, the ones here are 3 notched below
The service was rushed
The only thing better here is the decore
I would not go back to Gari unless it's to the one on the east side
Some sushi (good but not exceptional), but not enough to be satisfied
Two people some sake and 230$??? Forget it!
The food here was outstanding
Flavors so delicate, presentation so creative
Really outstanding
Only negatives were volume level - as so loud that it made it less enjoyable
And the maitre'd was very inexperienced - she was on the phone more than attending to arriving patrons, and was relatively clueless when seating patrons
These problems will probably iron out in time
Well, I liked the food here and the service was great
I ordered a thai iced tea, tuna roll, crabcakes, pad thai, pancakes, and ended it with a fried banana dish
I really liked the tuna roll and would highly recommend it
This restaurant is such a great find
It's in a convienent location and its a really comfy environment
The downstairs is really tidy and cute especially the large sitting area
It is empty but I find that to be a pro
They're usually open late and the service is phenomenal
Overall, I really liked it
The fried banana dish was good too
A must see!
Just happened upon this place one night and had a wonder ful dinner
The service was amazing and the food may be the best Thai in town
The grilled skirt steak with chili dipping sauce is spectacular
We went on a rainy Friday night at 7:30pm and were the only people in the restaurant
Dont expect it to be an alive place that will emit energy, its more of a local, calm, friendly feel
The service was prompt and extremely friendly
The menu has entrees and tapas, we went with the tapas to try new items and enjoy old favorites
The food was decent; some dishes were good and some were not
You should like onions/lemon, because every dish that wasn't in peanut or curry had plenty of them
The drink menu had a full assortment of saki drinks
I went with the saki green apple martini, which was prepared very well
Overall, I would only recommend if you want  a quiet, romantic dinner  a hassle free place on a crowded weekend night if you have a large group
It was relatively inexpensive (as its thai food)
We were 15 of us on my birthday and they seated us at a large and comfortable table downstairs
Our group was chaotic and yet the waitress (May) was patient, friendly attentive throughout
The food was really yummy, flavorful and so well presented
I loved both- the bass and the crispy whole fish
We ate and drank like kings and were so shocked when our bill came- it was such good value for money
They gave us a round of shots at the end- on the house!! Note this is not a fancy place- the decor is comfy, but average
If you value good food and service- especially on your birthday when you want to be sure to have a nice time- this is the place!
Saw this place in Time Out, cute little open air, great ambiance (downstairs would be great for a group and very cozy in winter)
Menu has both regular apps and entrees and tapas on the other side, so much to choose from and everything sounded delicious
Everything we got was good, service was great, prices were fine (a little high for thai but not really) surprised not more people there
Right next to Perbacco which was packed when we left at 11
my friends and i had a girls' night out to celebrate my friend and mine's birthdays last night at Ma*ya
we were seated downstairs in the table with the comfy throw pillowed seats
laid back ambience with the bamboo and lanterns
the whole crispy fish was delicious, melts in your mouth soooo good! the jumbo shrimp w/ japanese eggplant with red coconut curry was great
to top it all off, the LYCHEE SAKETINIs are OUT OF THIS WORLD! it truly lives up to it's name, nice balance of the sweet natural taste of lychee and the saketini
a lot better than the Hanoi Lychee Martinis we were served a few blocks over at Verlaine! good selection for cocktails! and for appetizers, the roti canai was good! our waitress was courteous, helpful and great help with recommending great altogether, delicious food and wonderful presentation
definitely would go there again sometime soon
highly recommended!
I hosted a bridal shower for 22 people at Ma*ya this past weekend and it was fantastic! The food was really good (beef salad, shrimp spring rolls and their stir-fry tofu and eggplant), the decor is so cute and romantic and the service was just above and beyond
Chef Hurapan was extremely accomodating to all of our demands and needs throughout the entire planning process
Everyone had a wonderful time and I received many praises from the guests for the party
I highly recommend this restaurant for your next event
In Short White subway tiles cover the floor and the walls of this narrow restaurant, which builds on the clean look with translucent chairs and green light effects
Most distinctive, though, is the all-vegetarian Thai menu
Market-fresh soups, noodles and curries are rounded out by veggies, tofu and various mushrooms, as well as the kitchen's high-quality renditions of duck, chicken and beef
Low prices and a lunch special add to the appeal
But loved every soy minute
I would recommend the Basil Duck
It was fantastic!
I have been to some of the most delicious restaurants in New York
and Pukk is a refreshing, wonderful addition to this mix
I have always hated fake meat, but Pukk really knows how to handle and transform this! The duck salad is out of this world--crunchy cashews, lots of spice and tang, and crisp faux duck morsals
It was in shere BLISS
I love that this restaurant doesn't white-ify their dishes or hold back on spices
Ordering a lot of appetizers is the way to go--you'll try wonderful selections of various things and enjoy every second of it
The service is attentive and friendly, but best of all the prices are sooo inexpensive! Compared to some of the most esteemed (and pricey)restaurants in New York, Pukk's originality and flavor is right up there!!! Enjoy a truly exellect meal--cruelty free! Pukk makes the world a better place
I resisted going to Pukk for a long time- it looked too hip for it's own good and I am/was devoted to another Thai restaurant close by
What a shame that I waited! The food is AMAZING, as are the prices
I'm not a vegetarin, but the food is so good you'll never miss the meat
Even their faux meats were darn good- and I'm not a tofu fan
Service is friendly and efficient
A little to dark in the rear of the restaurant, but that's my only complaint
Went to Pukk for the first time last week and just ordered delivery for tonight! The food is extremely fresh/full of flavor my husband I haven't found truly spicy Thai since we were in Thailand last year - but the spicing is perfect @ Pukk
Everything is vegetarian which is also great
Try the green curry and the spinach toast (which is more like a roll)
Service with true Thai hospitality
It was a little cool in the joing (temp), but otherwise comfortable
Hope they're around for a while
They deliver, too

I dine here at least once a month
The food is excellent and the service is great! I do not live in NYC, so when I do travel in, Compass is the place that I go
If you are looking for a great restaurant on the Upper West Side, I highly recommend Compass
Been here before w/o a problem, but after this time I will never return
Service was slow and while the waiter made an error with our food, we were not upset about the mixup until he became defensive and combative about it! Later, as our large party began filtering out, I overheard our waiter discussing the menu mixup to about 5 members of the staff, blaming us
In addition, he made some very hurtful comments about some of my group members! I was so hurt and disappointed with my experience
I urge you not to dine here - there is no need for such rudeness at such a high-class restaurant
And while the manager did offer an apology, I cannot ignore nor forget the hurt and shock I felt upon hearing the waiter insult my group
while we were still there!
Great space- big rooms that would be ideal for private parties- great food - had the chicken, short ribs and skate- the apple struedel was delicious
Good wine list- but the apple martini tasted distinctly of Windex
Our lovely waiter sent us off with scones for breakfast the following AM!
Our group of 6 had an 8pm Friday res'v
We were seated around 8:40
Menu looked promising, but since there was a new chef (2 weeks old), the waitress didn't know it very well
Then came the delays including about 40 minutes btw
appetizers and entrees
This despite our telling the staff that one of us had to leave by 10pm
Most of the entrees shows up at 10:05 - except one of two halibuts, which still wasn't ready, and the lamb chops, ordered rare, were cold and barely more than raw
Sent 'em back
They comped our dessert, but by then the damage was done what was supposed to have been a low-stress celebratory evening had turned into a cause for fretting
Too bad, too, because once the food Idid/I arrive, it was pretty good
And the room is lovely
Based on what I read here, frankly I wonder if they speak of the same restaurant
I dine @ Compass frequently and there is a reason why my friends and I return
Good food and warm friendly service
The staff is actually very accomodating
go and make a decision for yourself
Try the rack of lamb
it's devine
If you don't mind being cold, having dirty glassware, waiting 45 minutes to be seated after arriving first at opening, waiters who can't satisfy the most basic tasks (warm coffee, lemon slices, drinks arriving before the meal) then this place is for you
No accomodations were made when we asked to have our cold coffee included in the cost of the prix fix lunch (who's ever heard of coffee not being included in a prix fixe lunch)
Bottom line, avoid like the plague (boils to be specific)
Can't believe the 9
1 rating
We had 8p reservations were seated at 9:40
We were told the table was beeing set but of course it doesn't take 100 minutes to reset a table
Reservations seemed appropriate it did not matter
They knew my wife was pregnant and this did not seem to help
The manager offered a round of drinks but my wife couldn't have alcohol as she was pregnant
The service and food was awful--we sat at the table for a good 15 mintues before menus were brought over
My seared tuna was freezing cold
I asked to have it warmed, it came back cooked all the way through
My wife had the sea bass which was bland and dry
Not remotely close to a $100/couple meal--there are much better restaurants, in every respect, that have much food, service, ambience and value
Two thumbs down
Save your money
I ate at Compass Dec 20 before going to the Met
I was pleasantly impressed by the service, the food the wine list and the sommelier (Eddie)
The staff made you feel right at home and made sure to check our satisfaction at the appropriate times throughout the meal
The service was attentive without being obtrusive
There was a lo-carb menu which was great and was suited my wife's diet
I would highly recommend this restaurant before a Lincoln Center event or just anytime
I read some of the negative comments on this website regarding the service at Compass and all I can say is in my experience Compass scored a 10 out of 10 for service
Next time I will go with friends and get a booth
Expensive menu; EXTREMELY slow service; awful waiters - the salmon was disgusting and nothing was worth the extremely high price of waiting forever for nothing
go somewhere else
This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in quite a while
To begin, the restaurant itself is truly beautiful
I found it to be warmly elegant
We were greeted and seated promptly and courteously
Our waiter was very attentive, but never annoyingly so
The food was exceptional
I had the pea/lobster soup (light delish), lamb shank (big enough for Henry VIII), and apple strudel (a must must must have)
My friend had the $30 prix fixe (what a bargain)
risotto, chicken apple strudel
She was stuffed and had to take the strudel home (so good, she couldn't leave it behind)
The dinner ended with out waiter offering us a small shopping bag of cranberry scones for 'breakfast tomorrow'
I can truly say this was one of the best restaurants I've been to in quite a while
and I definitely have made the rounds
I am a little surprised at some of the reviews written here
I dine out frequently and found my experience @ Compass most enjoyable
The $30 3-course dinner was frankly amazing
Great value
The staff beginning with the tall gentleman at the door, waiters, etc
were as friendly and helpful as some of the best restaurants in town
Take a look
I was having small gathering and wanted a private room
Well they moved me from one room to what sounded nice the wine room
well theres a huge pole in the middle so that no one could talk to eachother
The salad with duck was horrible, the filet was probably one of the worst i ever had
Service was OK
The good thing was the apple strudel and the decor
GO Somewhere else
We went on an uncrowded Thurs
and after listening to the tables on either side of us complain about the delay in their food we too had to ask if it was ever coming
It did and we regretted it
Subpar
We didn't stay for desert (even though it was included in the prix fix) because it wasn't worth the hour wait
DO NOT GO HERE
Compass is a great neighborhood establishment
Great decor and service
The place is funky and the food great
I particularly enjoyed the price fix meal, which I think was more appropriately priced and the healthier options
Heavenly apple strudel
I had been to Compass a while back and it was a horrible experience
They were out of everything and one by one the server would tell us
The service was very mediocre as if business were so great that they didn't care we were even there
The food was okay, by no means good
I figured I'd give it another try again and I was so disappointed that I will never go back

Granted it's a tapas theme, so you take dishes as they come, but in addition we virtually had to rope the waiter to get any help after putting in the initial order
We also got another table's dished twice, permanently lost one of our dishes, and waited ages between our first and second orders
Ambiance and food are good, especially meatballs and brussel sprout dishes (micro portions, as you would expect)
Would probably not go again
Let's do this as simply as possible: Would you pay $15 for a mushroom? If I were an enterprising hot dog vendor I would set up shop right in front of this place
Went for dinner and then left (down $60 for two people, no drinks), went home and ate a pizza
Very nice ambiance though, and definitely recommend the bar
Alta is a home away from home
The ambience is casual yet beautiful (more so than my home at least), the food is great, and the service is nice
I've been here a few times with friends, which I will continue to do, but it's good and pleasant enough that I would get a meal here alone at the bar as well
Ate at Alta recently, sat at the bar w/ a friend, ordered a bottle of wine, and a 1/2 dozen tapas
It's a good looking bar area w/ plenty of seating for dinner
Despite it being a Saturday night in August, the restaurant area looked packed and was bustling w/ lots of young good-looking groups, many of whom seemed to be foreigners
Don't be deterred by the supposed trendiness as the food is very good, and the inventiveness of it was a nice change for my jaded NY palate
The bar area wasn't very crowded and a good vantage point for all the comings and goings in the restaurant area, which looked like fun to me
The service is adequate and the only shortfall I found were the desserts which didn't come close to measuring up to the rest of the excellent meal
I'll definitely be going back
After reading many of the negative reviews here, i'm becoming convinced that people have no idea what's going on--i found Alta to be absolutely charming--the hostess gave us a quick tour of the place, stopping in the kitchen--even the chef said hello, and accommodating us when we added an wxtra person at the last minute
The food came fast and often, the sangria was awesome--and yes it takes a while to get there, but this is no ordinary sangria mix from a jug--it's a layered drink and it is ENORMOUS! We especially liked the ribs, the tuna tartare, and the piquillo peppers--this is not an expensive night at all and we will def be back!
Not as an extensive a menu as in Spain but GREAT FOOD!! I went here with moderate expertations and was pleasantly surprised
Extensive wine list will suit everyone
Ask waiters for pairings
Tapas are sooooo good
One to try: Cauliflower balls and Seafood Risotto
Everything I ordered was great so don't be afraid to be adventurous
One thing to remember, although the tapas aren't a lot, they add up to a lot
But, still this place is moderately priced
After two terrific meals in the dining room, we opted to sit at the bar on our third visit
This restaurant had been an easy recommendation for friends and clients with it's warm ambiance, good food and knowlegable staff
The nonchalant dismissive bar service - or lack of - must be losing revenue for the owner
You have to get their attention to place orders or request refills - they simply won't do it without being asked
Pretty tedious for a party of 6
My friends left annoyed and I left embarrassed that I chosen the spot
Highly reccommend! I've been 3 times now: the 1rst time in a big group, then back w/ a friend tonight on my own to eat at the bar- the space is beautiful, big high ceilings with skylights balconies a fireplace, candles everywhere, a cosmopolitan, lively crowd
Of course, the food is why I've returned so often though- really interesting combinations like tuna tartar w/ nuts heart of palm, a spinach salad w/ dried cherries garlic cream, cauliflower w/ chorizo clams- yum! Some plates are disappointingly small- so ask- plan on ordering about 3 for yourself- Interesting wine selection too, alot of unusual choices
Service needs improvement, def like being in Europe! I'll be back
Ever have the feeling the kitchen staff is laughing at you because it so blatant that they are taking you for a ride? Upon entering Alta the bar and restaurant decor ironically misguide the patron
While the bar is expansive, the ceilings are high, the tables are spacious and the plates are oversized, where is the food? The portions were so insignificant that after ordering 12 dishes we still had to run across to Corner Bistro to douse our hunger
Alta has great food but the agony of waiting for it is not worth it
The restaurant only fits 50 people, has a set menu with less than 30 tapas dishes on it yet for some reason they are unable to deliver the dishes at the same time or close to it
They ran out of sangria at approximately 10:15 pm on Saturday night! Watch out for the overworked, stressed out waitress who dumps tapa dishes on the table and leaves w/out announcing what it is
Great ambiance, HOWEVER: They ran out of sangria (about 9:30 p
m
on a Sat
night) AND THE PLACE WAS NOT EVEN PACKED! The service was abhorrent
I know there were 10 of us, but we ordered drinks and waited a half hour
Waitress came to one side of table, but not to the other
Food was slow to come out
We had to BEG for dessert and they managed to screw that us as well
Food portions were tiny
YES, I do understand what tapas means, but this was nouvelle quisine
Food tasted good (for the most part), but it is customary to ask people how they would like their steak done (all 5 of ours were RAW
) OVERPRICED, SLOW, LOUSY SERVICE, TINY PORTIONS
Maybe that'll fly in Barcelona, but not in NYC!!!
I have been to Alta several times already for both business and pleasure
Every visit has offered amazing innovative food options
It has been both excellent for the groups I've brought, and equally intimate as a quiet meeting place
The 35-plus item menu has been different every time that I have been! The food/menu is interesting and delicious, not contrived and forced
It has soul!!  I hear the chef, Harrison Mosher, has a phat resume
It definately shows
Keep those amazing little morsels coming!!! This place is ultra Alta on my list!  For those who can't get enough to eat: If you don't understand the civilized concept of tapas, go elsewhere!
Went for dinner a few nights ago with a few friends and had an exceptional time
The staff was super friendly, even the chef said hello as we were escorted through the kitchen to get to our table
The tasty small plates were perfect because it gave us a chance to try so many different menu items
All in all the food was fabulous, the wine list is pretty extensive and the atmosphere is so comfortable you don't want to leave! We will definately be going back soon
Live nearby and have been a few times
The wine list and ambience is excellent at the bar, but as a restaurant it is extremely lacking
The mediterranen small plates, aka tapas, are overpriced and extremely small
If you are not careful you can easily spend more than $100 and not even be full
Go for a glass of wine, and save yourself the hassle of being upset over your dinner
The fancy accoutrements and fancier prices don't really encourage the tapas concept of snacking-while-boozing
But some dishes are totally worth forking over the extravagant prices: the cauliflower/clam/chorizo/raisin casserole is very tasty, and the artisinal cheese plate with quince jelly works very well (the cheese has a strong raw milk flavor)
Yummy sangria and a full list of reasonably-priced Mediterranean wines are strong points
Not the ideal spot when you're really hungry -- the plates are tiny and the prices not (like every other upscale tapas place)
The menu sounds intriguing, but when the dishes come out they taste rather like
when you slave away at a fussy recipe in your home kitchen and it doesn't quite come out like it does in the restaurant
Nothing is terrible, but nothing stands out either
Notably, the chef's specialty cauliflower is oily, mushy, and a mess of flavors
Messy flavor combinations are actually somewhat of a constant here (bitter choc mousse w/ sour poached pear??)
Seems to be better suited to drinking than eating -- the very long bar is nice and the Sangria is quite good (not the sugary jug wine variety here)
And the service is friendly enough
Went with a group of 4 people last night for a 9pm reservation
We ended up sitting at 9:45 and it took another 20 minutes to get our waters and menus
Although the dishes we had were pretty tasty, any one of us could have eaten everything that was brought to the table
We ordered about 8 large plates and 4 small plates
We agreed that we could have kept ordering, but never would have filled up so we called it a night and went right to Joe Jr's diner to eat
The food and atmosphere here were great
Interesting layout as you are escorted through the kitchen to your table if you eat upstairs (additional space is under construction)
I'm a big fan of tapas and I expect them to be small portions (have traveled extensively and enjoy the concept of eating this way), but the menu is listed from smallest to largest portions
The last section was described to us as substantial sized, yet we needed 5 or 6 of these plates to feed three of us, plus about 8 to 10 other smaller dishes
so, we just kept on ordering and ordering
The service was great - host and waitress were very nice (bartender had zero personality) and the food was very tasty
The decoration is what you expect of a design wine cellar
calid wood ambience
The wine list is simpressive
You can tell the service enjoys what they do and love to talk about wine
The food we had was like having pintxos in Barcelona
Highly recommended
The Scene Clean aqua, cream and gray tones set a cool mood in the narrow dining room--an ambience only somewhat spoiled by the reverberating din of diners' voices
The service is attentive

The food was great and the prices are very good
Simply tastefully decorated with a definite Brazilian vibe
Very good service! We ordered appetizers that were served in a perfectly timed sequence with our entrees
(Not back to back, and with time to enjoy our wine that was served before
) The menu has traditional Brazilian dishes with some continental choices as well
I can't wait to go back!
Went for a date last week to Malagueta, and although I was initially hesitant to dine there, I'm delighted at what an excellent restaurant it turned out to be
The place was empty, but I can't understand why (other than the location, I suppose)
The food was mouth-watering, and the by far the finest I've had in Astoria (and I've done my field work)
Since I left, I haven't stopped talking about it
The calamari appetizer was probably the best I've ever had
I ordered the quail, which came with crispy spinach (crazy sensation, but absolutely delicious)
My date had the chicken with prosciutto and fontina cheese - he's not so daring with his food choices (it was hard enough to get him to try Brazilian), and even he was over the moon with the meal
Trying something new definitely paid off
I'm in love
We're definitely going back
From outside it doesn't look special and it is in an area with not many restaurants, but they have very good food and reasonable prices
The flan is highly recommended
With Brazilian cuisine you usually expect a predictable menu but Malagueta was different in the variety and creativity in its menu
The use of spices and ingredients was creative, different and simply delicious
I am not a fish fan but even the pollock I tried was to die for! Everything was in perfect portions and very satisfying
The presentation of the food was very french style and makes you feel as though you are at a fancy restaurant
And honestly, the food at Malagueta was better than most over-priced, fancy restaurants Ihave been to
I highly recommend Malagueta if you are in the mood for a wonderful and different meal
And the fact that it is tucked away in Astoria Queens is a plus as it keeps away those irritating too good for Queens types out
This restaurant is tucked away on a side street
I don't go to a lot of Brazilian restaurants, but I do eat a lot, and this is good food
Get the sausage and yuca appetizer, and then go for the steak
It's really good
I finished with a flan made of coconut milk and the price was right
Go, and eat
Your stomach and your wallet will thank you
This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad he did, otherwise I would never have known about this little treasure in Astoria
Being to other Brailian restaurants in the past, I had expected the menu to consist of primarily steak, but it was well varied
The food is excellent
The staff courteous and the prices were reasonable
I will definitely go again
I just came back from vacation in Brazil and the food was actually better in Malagueta
The only downside is that you wont see girls dresses like they do in brazil walking down the sidewalk in Astoria
But, if you already have a girl, you wont have this problem cause youll probraly bring her to the restaurant
Actually, you can pick up a Brazilian girl at the restaurant while your eating
Went for an early (7:00 p
m
) dinner on a Friday night and was seated directly under the loudest speakers
The music was so loud that we could not actually hold a conversation
Our servers kept lowering the volume, but the manager kept raising it even higher
It did not make for an enjoyable experience
Do not sit in the room off to the left with the low ceiling
and don't depend on the manager to cater to your request (the servers will be on your side)
To be fair, the food was excellent although there was a 25 minute wait between appetizers and entrees; prices were reasonable
Servers were attentive and more the proficient
This is a nice place I stumbled upon while looking for an open restaurant on a late Friday night
Hungry for Risotto, I ordered the special without inquiring as to the price - at $25, easily the most expensive thing on the menu, and certianly overpriced, if really delicious
I would recommend this place, however, as most items are reasonably prices and the ambience is chic and cozy
you wouldn't know the place was there if you didn't know it was there
cool little place
bar and some tables in front w/ more tables in back and a courtyard coming in spring
red brick walls w/ a warehouse type look
everything is brand new and very clean
excellent, gourmet pub food w/ a little latino flair
open face steak sandwich w/ peppers, onions and bleu cheese served on a slab of garlic bread, $9
excellent
cuban sandwich and polenta appetizer also excellent
ambience would be excellent but they need to address the acoustics
very loud
service was more than solid, i guess i just couldn't describe it as excellent
Does not hold a candle to The Pump
Manager (owner?) totally out of touch with the guest experience
Amateur hour
I am very disappointed
I entered an order online and after 15 minutes  I got a call from energy kitchen who first told me that I was out of their delivery range
According to the website I am not out of range, I am in fact directly in the range of delivery (67th street)
Also, I ordered from Energy Kitchen before and had it delivered
After inquiring again why they would not deliver, I was told that tonight they were short of delivery people
So be warned, if you are hungry and order, you may just get a call 15 minute afterwards to let you know that they are not taking your order after all
And you might not get a straight answer!!!
I love eating here
The staff are extremely nice, the food is never a disappointment, and I always walk away with at least 1 protien brownie and 1 protien muffin to take home
Whenever I'm in the area, I always make a point to stop by, even if I'm not hungry
Would recommend this to anyone
even if ur not looking to be healthy
Tastes fantastic
Try the Phili Cheese Wrap
We never miss an opportunity to go to Cellini's when we're in NYC
My wife and I just walked in one day without knowing a thing about the place
We were delighted to find a great restaurant, with excellent food, reasonable prices, and very good service
It seemed as though most of the people there were regulars or people like us who just stopped in and decided to try it
You don't go to Cellini's if you are on your first date
It doesn't have the ambiance for that
But if you are now at a stage in your relationship where you just want a great meal in a friendly restaurant then Cellini's is the place for you
We've been there many times as a couple and recently with a large group and the dining experience was the same - excellent
We love this charming little restaurant! Nestled in the ground floor of a Tudor-style building apartment building, the Archway has a cozy, welcoming ambience
The food is delicious - have been there for dinner (awesome pastas, great salad) and brunch
Note that it does get crowded for brunch here, but for dinner, you're almost guaranteed whichever table you want
Courteous service, food feels made to order
Priced fine - not supercheap, midpriced, but that's the kind of place it is
Dining here is like taking a nice leisurely break, with great food, far from the usual hubbub of Manhattan
(The beautiful thing is, you are still in Manhattan!)
What a lovely restaurant
Once you find it, it is most definitely worth the price of admission

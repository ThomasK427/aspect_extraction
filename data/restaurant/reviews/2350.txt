We recommend it highly!!!!
Heard great things about this place and was sorely disappointed
First of all, the gaucomole is flavorless, expensive and extremely overated
Good ambience and the entrees were okay, no awards won here
Being a Bi Coastal guy I cannot find good pizza in Cali nor can I find good mexican in NYC
just doesn't happen
this place is ok at best
sorry but that's the truth
If you want a good taco/burrito come West!
Every week or so, I have to satisfy my guacamole jones at Rosa Mexicano
It really IS that good, and will make you look at the mushy, store-bought glop with disdain for the rest of your life
The blend of creamy-yet-firm avocado, fiery jalapeno, crisp tomato, bracing onion, cilantro and, most important, SALT, is enough to make me want to write sonnets and symphonies
It's too bad that the entrees fail to live up to the guacamole's brilliance--and they're priced about $5-10 too much for their quality
However, the back dining room is pretty (the crowded front room is cramped and dark), and the exceedingly polite waiters will cater to your every whim
Have a few pomegranate margaritas, and you won't mind the bill
and you'll return for that guacamole
The service was prompt and courteous, and while the guacamole was better than average, the rest of the meal wasn't really anything special
For example, the flavor in each dish didn't really stand out and the spanish rice seemed more like uncle ben's with peas and corn mixed in
Given the price we were hoping for something better and probably won't go back
amazing food, though the prices are a bit steep
always have a hard time paying the big bucks for a simple frozen margarita
I have never experienced better service anywhere! The food was delicious, especially the guacamole
Although the prices are a little high, Rosa Mexicano is definitely worth it! I also strongly recommend the pomegranite margarita
No problem getting a table on friday night either!
Elegant mexican food! I love the making of the guacamole in front of you!
i have been in this restaurants many time i have never been dissapionted
guacamole, mole sauce, tortillas etc etc etc
The Filet Medalions in a mushroom sauce are OUT OF THIS WORLD
The guac is a great way to start
but save room for the yummy dinners
Finally, a mexican restaurant you can go to and not feel like an overstuffed burrito on the way out of
While Rosa Mexicano still serves good, authentic Mexican food and an excellent margaritas the restaurant has lost a good deal of its appeal
I used to frequent the establishment about once a week and thought it was great
But, with a crowded bar area with no room to maneuver, service that lacks attentiveness, and an unwillingness to meet simple requests my attitude has changed
Perhaps the management needs to stop reading the kudos they receive and get back to the basics that got them first noticed
Rosa Mexicano has the best homemade guacamole! They prepare it tableside and it is delicious
The food is great and the ingredients are fresh and homemade
The service is good and the waiters know what they are talking about
Every time I go there I expect it to be good, but I'm disappointed every time
The Guacamole is great, the portions are small and overpriced
The pollo asado(jajitas) skillet is 3x2 inches in size
I like to judge mexican restaurants based on their fajitas
I give theirs a 5 out of 10
This is the best mexican in the city! Yeah, the others are good too, but this hyped up place should be hyped because the pomagranite marguaritas, freshly prepared guacamole (add in the cilantro!!), and exquisitely prepared sizzling steak with rice and beans are awesome! The ambience can go from romantic to a fun fiesta, dinner for two to dinner for 10, its a great place for everyone!
Everything about this restaurant was great
Great food!! Great Service!! Gaucomole prepared at table is highly recommended!! Reservations definately required!!
I have no problem opening up the wallet for fine dining
However, I expect to get what I pay for
I just dined at Rosa Mexicana last night with two buddies of mine, and the bill was $190 dollars (with tip)
I just don't see how Mexican food with a couple of margaritas (no wine) can end up being that expensive
It's flour, corn, beans, and melted cheese for crying out loud
On the positive side, the food is pretty solid
Recommended obviously is the guacamole (one $14 serving really isnt' enough for two hungry people by the way), which they make right in front of you
The entrees are decent and there is ample selection
The service is satisfactory
Gets the job done, but nothing special
The ambiance is nice, although they had the heat turned way up last night and it was only in the 60's outside
I went to Rosa Mexicano for the first time this past Saturday
I had a great time with my date, who loved the food
I was seated immediately and everyone was friendly
I enjoyed the attention we reacieved and the food, too
The margaritas are great
We had a romantic experience
I would wait for a table next time, the food was that good
I really enjoyed my experience at Rosa on 1st Ave
Everyone was really nice and the food was great
Customer service tends to be snotty in NYC, but not here
I would go back just for the Guac
I love this place! Great atmosphere
great architecture
a fun and exciting place for any occasion
Their food is incredible and authentic! A must!
great mexican food, not commercialized mexican, real quality food, best fish dishes I ever had and oh the margaritas! and fresh guacomole!
I recently visited Rosa Mexicano and was appalled by the rude behavior from the short-haired blonde hostess
Upon entering the restaurant I was placed on a waiting list which was understandable
I was told the wait would be about 30-40 minutes
After waiting about 45 minutes, my girlfriend asked if we'd be seated soon and the hostess who I later found out was the manager rudely rolled her eyes at her and said Ya'll can either wait patiently or ask someone if you can sit on their lap
She laughed and said she was joking, but I don't feel this tasteless sense of humor should be used by a person who is supposed to be running the restaurant
I got seated 15 minutes after, no thanks to the manager
The food was wonderful and the waiter was attentive
It's a shame that the management needs major adjustments
Homesick for California Mexican food no more
Rosa Mexicano pulls off great authentic Mexican and not the blander, oily, Americanized stuff we've grown up with
Try the freshly-made guacamole and if you want only to splash salsa all over your meal, go to Taco Bell
Each entree is flavorful enough
Very festive but crowded, so plan for at least one margarita while you wait to be seated
After living in TX and Mexico for many years, i can say that the food here is neither authentic nor inventive
From average to bad, the food does not deserve the credit of best mexican restaurant
The one saving grace is the pomegranite margaritas
Go there, enjoy the decor, have a drink, maybe some app's at the bar, but don't eat there
I have never been to Rosa, but I must admit this establishment was cozy and warm
Not only was the hostess and server helpful and polite, but the food was great
I especially enjoyed the guacamole and the tuna
The food isn't what I consider normal mexican food, but it was delightfully delish! They also accomadated us this past weekend when our party increased from 4 people to 6
This place is heavenly!!! I truly don't know what that clown Matthewhh was talking about -- he's probably from a rival restaurant or something
Oooh, the Guac is divine!!!
Yes, the guacamole was heavenly
But everything else was so bland, cheap-tasting, and somehow off that now, 24 hours later, I still have a stomachache, a funny taste in my mouth, and a HUGE hole in my wallet
After the guacamole, everything else tasted like it came from a can
I've had more interesting meals at the Hat

Unfortunately, it has gotten more popular (no wonder) and you might need a reservation on the weekend
This is a charming little restaurant
We brought some out of town guests who had requested Italian in the Village and couldn't have been happier w/ Da Andrea
Our waiter was charming and efficient
Our dinners were all wonderful and appetizers of asparagus soup and augula salad were great
I'm going back to try some more pasta dishes
My friend's ravioli was superb
We got there before our friends and made sure we didn't need reservations
If you are more than two, you should make reservations
The restaurant is small, but not on top of each other
The service - excellent
The food - excellent
The prices - CHEAP
They could easily charge 5-8 dollars more per entree
Four of us - entrees, bottle of wine and dessert ~$88
We are going back for a nice casual, well prepared and served meal
I have dined here many times
The staff are relaxed but charming, and they make a genuine effort to make you feel welcome and comfortable
The food is genuine Italian food - always good and sometimes better than good
The owners are Italian-Italian and consequently the place lacks the cheesy, pretentious quality of many Italian-American places
A perfect place to take your parents, and I mean that in a good way
Good Service, good food, great Chianti Classic I would recommend to all
I've eaten at Vittorio's a couple of years ago and was very pleased especially with the quality and quantity of The Wheel - a specialty pasta dish
Recently, I returned and was completely dissatisfied
After ordering The Wheel, I was presented with a portion comparable to that of an appetizer
After I had finished my portion in 2 minutes, I commented to the waiter how disappointed I was with the portion size
His commet to me was, yes, we decreased the portion size of this item
Why not tell me that when I placed my order, or even mention that I might consider ordering another entree in addition
Basically, all I received was a mumble
This family owned and operated Northern Italian makes you feel at home from the moment you walk in the door
From their daily menu (witht he fabulous wheel of pasta thae makes Fettucine Alfredo seem out of date) to their wonderful seasonal and game specials, this is a place that knows the value of fine ingredients
Their rack of lamb - which many people would not think to order in an italian restaurant, although it is authentic - was beautifully rare, while still being exceedingly tender and flavorful
There simple vegetable prepations never rob the dishes of flavor or color
And the service is just wonderful, making you feel right at home but never hovering
The artwork is done by Vittorio himself, and is for sale - but be serious, this art is not inexpensive
Went for the first time two days ago for a late afternoon family get-together
What a wonderful place, and with a beautiful outdoor garden in back! Delicious food, perfect service, gracious hosts
I will definitely be back!
WALKED BY THIS PLACE FOR YEARS NEVER WENT IN--BIG MISTAKE--THIS IS A KEEPER--GOOD FOOD SERVICE--NO HYPE/TRENDY PEOPLE, WHAT MORE COULD ONE ASK FOR!!!!!!!
This is the kind of restaurant who's name is whispered among friends, not among the BP/trendy set
If you like pasta and parmesiano-regiano - you must dine at Vittorio
The waiter brings out a GIANT wheel of cheese and swirls pasta inside it
Unbelievable
Vittorio's is our absolute favorite Italian restaurant in Manhattan! Vittorio does Northern Italian food to perfection, and his rotating regional menu usually has something we want to try
My husband recommends the Wheel
It's unbelievable: just fresh house-made fettuccini, hot from the water, swirled inside a bowl made from a wheel of Parmesian cheese
No cream, only cheese, and the best, creamiest pasta you can imagine
There is also a lovely back patio during the summer
very friendly service so show it with a good tip
Prices are as low as $5 so you can def find something youll like at a bargain
Food takes a few min to get ready but its very very tasty
Its the softest lamn meat ive eaten in america in a long time
theres a restaurant style seating or a take out counter
This is a fine Turkish fast food restaurant with good service and value food
It is one of the best Turkish fast food restaurants in the city
I definately recommend as a value, fast food restaurant
$5 lunch special
Great kabbobs, Falafael and more
You can't go wrong!
Istanbul Grill serves quality Turkish cuisine fast and cheap
The recently renovated space offers a small, but clean and pleasant eating area
My favorite is the falafel sandwich, but everything--from kebabs (as sandwiches or platters) to thabouli salad--is great
If only they'd get the amazing Turkish bread they used to serve back, but for now the pita is fine
I live on Carmine street and I go to this place at least 2 times a week!! great food, great service (Rita is awesome !!) and the prices are ridiculously low
!! Go, and you won't be disappointed !
The Scene Though its mean streak has mellowed with age (there was a time when the owner stood by the door with a baseball bat), the Hog Pit is still known as one of the more rough-and-tumble watering holes in town
With or without the brawls, where else can you rub elbows with Hell's Angels while chowing down on black-eyed peas and listening to Hank Williams?  The Food The menu lists affordable soul food and barbecue favorites
Start with a round of appetizers--airy hush puppies and meltingly tender baby back pork ribs are all great
For your second round, go for chicken dumplings in a rich broth studded with good pieces of chicken, or opt for traditional meat loaf
Save room for extra sides, even though two come with each main course: The collard greens, gooey mac and cheese and ham-hocked lima beans all stoke the soul like the sound of a pedal-steel guitar
While the service was good, the food was a disgrace! As a Southerner, I can say that the food was absolutely tasteless
Yuck!
This is a fun bar, but the food is pitiful
Typical New York attempts at southern food
Servings are big, which, I guess, is good? But don't get excited about the bbq here
Instead, come a little later and get a Pabst
Like those before me, I TOTALLY recommend trying the yam fries with the raspberry ketchup
In my opinion they are even better than the ribs sauce
The mac and cheese was creamy, and coleslaw not flavorful enough
All in all a nice place to try
The Hog Pit's name fits the atmosphere
It's a bar with a pool table and great country-western vibe
The ribs are yummy and portions are large
You get two sides with the ribs so appetizers may be overkill
I say this after the fact because we got the fried pickles and the sweet potato fries
Both were really good, the raspberry ketchup that comes with the sweet potato fires has a nice tangy bite
Avoid the corn on the cob, it wasn't very fresh
After appetizers, ribs and two sides I was so full I had to roll myself out the door
i had baby back ribs
yummy! appertizers and side dishes were all great as well
but i must tell you this place is no fancy restaurant
you are eating in a middle of crowded bar
when i went there, i saw only one waitress for the entire place
only one girl! and she was drunk too
there were a few guys who collect dishes and stuff, but they don't take orders
you won't be seated promptly
you cannot make a reservation
music is too loud
your waitress is drunk, but you go there for good foods!!
Don't be fooled into the chatter about Blue Smoke and Danny Meyer's reputation

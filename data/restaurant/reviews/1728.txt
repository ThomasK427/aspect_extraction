The food is very resonably priced and is very taste
It is one of those places that you just have to try
You can always count on a truly relaxing and enjoyable evening at this place
It is a nice neighborhood restaurant where the owners treat you really well
They never rush you in and out, and there is overall a warm feeling about the place
As for the food, the scallion dumplings are is out of this world! We always order lots of entrees and pass them around
It is a nice treat for out-of-towners who might not have tasted Afghani food
This is the best afghani restaurant in the city
They have a chicken kubideh dish which is phenomenal!
The service here is extremely friendly and helpful, the food is incredible, and it's never busy
We sat on the floor at one of the window tables for hours
Try the pumpkin samosas
They're unbelievable
I have eaten here a few times
The value is great -- the portions are enormous
I got pad thai once and I swear it was like a vat
The food is not particularly spicy or even particularly saturated with flavor but it hits the spot when you're craving some Thai without having to go very far
I wouldn't go across town for this place, but I would and did go down the block and around the corner
my office moved to the neighborhood recently and i've been craving thai - the reviews here made me think to try viang ping
i ordered some spring rolls and sticky rice to go
you know how thai spring rolls are usually lightly fried, crisp pockets of fresh veggies and glass noodles? not these
they tasted frozen and may have been fried twice to reheat
the sauce was thin and had a terrible aftertaste
i usually grab some sticky rice and dip it into sauce, but not this sauce
unfortunately, the rice was already ruined
a tiny packet of rice was wrapped in saran wrap
it must have been done a long time ago since it was hard and chewy
ugh
i won't be going back
on the plus side, it looks like a new thai place just opened across the street on 23rd - maybe i'll try them next
I happened upon the place by accident, trying to meet people for happy hour
No one shows up to happy hour and it's pouring outside, so I'm pissed and get food at Viang Ping down the street
The food tastes great, and the portions are BIG for the relatively CHEAP prices
Curteous staff, would definitely go again for good Thai
I went there for dinner and I guess that must have been the wrong time
I had the BBQ Chicken and it was THE WORST i've ever had
The chicken was extremely dry to the point that it was hard for my knife to cut though
The BBQ sauce was basicly katcup with a tiny bit of seasoning
My dinner was not over priced but for the quality it was
However, looking at the rest of the items, I would say this place is price for an eatery
A hot dog for $8
50??? How do they justify this?
This place is packed for breakfast and brunch on weekends, so go super early, or wait for those rare New York City weekends when everyone leaves town
Best egg dishes in the city
The prices are only slightly higher than at a diner, but far, far better
And you'll surely roll out stuffed
The atmosphere is bright, energetic, and retro
Consistant, Super Tasty and full of options
Try the amazing Blue Plate Tuna or chips and dip, you won't want to have them anywhere else
Friendly non-intrusive service and convenient location
It's just a good place to have a truly good meal
I went last night and even that they were closing the staff was really nice
I ordered the Mac Cheese, White bean soup (exquisite) and the chocolate cake
The waitress was also really nice! I definitely recommend!
Great food, great service, great atmosphere
I love this place and have recommended it for years
The Scene After work crowds mingle in the bar; the sparse dining room, with its towering ceilings and fans fashioned out of fishing rods, The feeling here is whimsical
The shape of diamonds one would find on a playing card dots the white walls
Along the black leather banquette, you might see couples gazing, shoppers sated with new possessions, or good-looking jetsetters enjoying dinner before heading to the nightclub upstairs
The Food The menu seems quirky, but upon a closer look ingredients are familiar and made into appealing combinations, with influences from Maine to the Mediterranean
Appetizers, like toasted haloumi cheese and watermelon salad, standout
Spicy chicken tamales in banana leaves are balanced nicely with duck sauce, but mussels could use better seasoning
Entrees, like the Singapore schnitzel--a rather dull combination of fried duck and rice--aren't as enticing as starters
Opt instead for the exquisite lobster roll
A friend suggested it as a good place to go on a weeknight for good food and great drinks - and I agree! We went at 9pm and despite a crowded bar, there was no wait
The fist dishes were really good - the Ahi especially
I definitely recommend
Waitress was attentive - food was timely
i came here last week with my girlfriend and man were we stoked
we had been hearing good things bout this place from friends, internet etc
But we were totally surprised
the food was awesome and the prices are unheard of for nyc
we met the chef and he bought us a round of drinks
thanks for a great dinner punch!!!
On a recent Trip to NYC I ate at Punch on Broadway
This was a great restaurant with moderate prices
We waited for about 30 minutes without reservations but the Bar was great
Appitizers, Crab Cakes, Bread, and Desert were all great
Service was very good too
I highly recommend this restaurant for your next visit to New York
The food is average, however the service is way below average (our waiter was a stuttering fool when it came to the specials and left our drinks empty for the majority of the night) The atmostphere is cheesy as well as the crowd
Lets just say I won't be returning, and if you haven't been, you're not missing anything
a nice trendy place for a girls night out! food, ambiance and staff was amazing! the waitress was so attentive
she recommended a nice bottle of shiraz to go with our meal
the proportion was perfect
not too big, nor too small
i noticed a handful of cute customers there as well
another reason why i should go back again
hehe
The food is very good and terribly interesting
The cocktails are simply wonderful and creative
I absolutely adore their drink that has vodka and blood orange
I went with 6 other people, we had a reservation and were seated right away
I'm not sure I would recommend a party of more than 10 at the most
Generally there were tables of 2-4 filled
I went to Punch with my wife a few months ago
The food was horribly over-cooked and the waiter was rude
He was muttering expletives under his breath and when we complained about the food he rolled his eyes at us
The decor was sloppy and the ambience was poor
I ate dinner at Punch last Sunday night and was so pleased

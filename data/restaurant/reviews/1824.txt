00 just on water as they kept bringing out bottles without asking, restaurants do this to larger groups called banging them out to run up the tab
I should have known Barolo was hurting when they hung that tacky 42 plasma on the sidewalk to LURE people into the back garden
They are hurting because their food and service is horrible
we almost didn't go to Barolo -- based on the reviews here
but, noting that most were pretty old, we took a chance
very glad we did! the garden at barolo is stunning
the food is GOOD
and the service, which all these reviews complained about, was excellent
we were seated right away, food was brought promptly, waiters pleasant and efficient
it seems that the management took note of the lousy reviews here and have pulled their socks up! go citysearch!
Barolo has authentic northern Italian food
I highly recommend the pasta--it's homemade and absolutely delicious
The outdoor patio is also incredible
We went to this restaurant in the late afternoon
I have never been ignored by so *many* people before-the place was teeming with servers, busboys, hostesses and managers, none of whom would deign to look at us
I thought it might be that I just wasn't their kind, until I read the other reviews about the bad service
Well, we may *not* be there kind, but I would consider that a good thing
We went to a place down in Soho, on West Broadway - the restaurant Barolo
The waiters were cads, the food and service -  beyond bad, This place is simple a no-go
This place has a definite romantic candlit cozy feeling
Would make a good place to take a date except the food and service wasn't that great
We waited a long time for our food and of course they got my order wrong
I had the seafood linguine but I requested without calamari, and of course they forgot and put it in
So i had to wait even more to get my dish
The bread was cold also
My dish tasted very bland like something I could make on my own
The pasta tasted like it came straight from the box, def not homemade
And the dish was expensive also
Overall, I would not recommend this place, but I hear they do have a very nice garden out back
Myself and three friends had dinner on a Saturday night
We sat, missing a place setting for a while before the waitress came to ask if we wanted water and then ran away
This was her thing, apparently
Barely able to tell us the specials, she asked our orders, and then had to come back twice because she forgot them
I ordered a cocktail, never got it, asked for a glass of wine, never got it
They might want to look into order pads and pens for the waitstaff!! My dessert menu came with no insert and her reply was I don't write the menu! The food was nothing great, and although the room was sort of pretty, it was filled with the kind of BT trash you try to avoid on weekends
you might be drawn in by the luminous garden with the soft sounds of cascading water, but beware! inside lurks the worst dining experience you can imagine
prepare to be ignored by everyone, from the person who should have wiped down the table to the host and waiter
they complain about you behind your back and bring you the wrong bland food
25$ minimum?? only the tackiest of places need to do that! we orded salads and beers, each salad came out wrong, served to the wrong person, and the waiter came back to inform us that he didn't have a single one of the drinks we ordered in stock because they had already emptied their fridget for the night
HORRIBLE AND AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
The garden IS amazing
my boyfriend took me here for my birthday a few weeks ago and I was so excited when we were walking down Thompson St
behind the place and looked in
However the hostess completely ignored us, we waited 40 min at the bar (even with reservation), our waitress was incredibly uninterested in us (never even offered dessert menus) and the somelier could have taken a look at the label before he made a mistake about his favorite wine
After hours the place turns into a haven for young wanna-be hipsters who get ID' at the door
Food is mediocre italian
all in all the outdoor space almost cant make up for the attitude
After waiting thirty minutes for a table outside, we were given two menus for a group of six
Another twenty minutes passed before our waiter arrived to take our orders
Twenty minutes later we requested water and bread, which arrived fifteen minutes later
An hour later, everyone received plates they didn't order and had to juggle them around
As for me, i had to wait for my fish(which had somehow been confused with spaghetti???) which arrived much later, after everyone had finished eating
It was also irritating that our waiter never offered us olive oil or parmesan, which they brought to all the other tables
I'm in disbelief that anyone could have given this restraunt a 10
I had the Valentine's Day menu and it was unbelievable
This was a last minute booking and well worth it
The food was excellent, right down to the cocoa fettucine with black truffles and porccinni mushrooms
and the sweet potato cheescake with berries - YUM! I loved it
The ambiance was very romantic and the service was superb
The wine list is an encyclopedia!!! Everything you could possibly want
A true dining experience! I can't wait to go again!
I have been to Barolo many times and now will never go there again
My boyfriend and I went there last night and Steven our waiter was by far the rudest most offensive waiter I have come across in all of NYC
After our disappointing meal and terrible service we asked to speak to the manager (who was sitting alone having a glass of wine) when we were told he was too busy to speak to us! He then looked at us, turned away and continued to enjoy his wine
Bottom line the food isn't great and I have had better service at Burger King
Do not go!! There are hundreds of better places with good food and nice servers!
Everthing about Barolo is cool
The location is perfect, the garden is beautiful and all of the food is authentic
Try the antipasto and all of their fresh vegetables
The fish of the day and the pasta of the day have always pleased thetable! The brunch is fantastic and wonderful when it's sunny in the garden
You'd think it would be difficult to not make eye contact in this very tiny space, but the waitstaff here are masters at it
While waiting to be seated, not one of 3 servers greeted us or asked us if we wanted to be seated, although they brushed past us at least 5 times
After asking the counterperson if there was a method to getting seated here, she said the back was full and that was the reason no one made eye contact or said hello
There are millions of places to spend money in NY, and NO ONE should spend any here
Ferrara is 2 blocks away and the pastries are better
Good pastries are never a substitution for being courteous to your customers
On a recent visit after dinner to grab dessert with my wife and daughter, my wife was insulted by one of the waiters for asking if there were any additional napoleons in the kitchen
To both our surprise, this inquiry was interpreted as a personal offense by the waiter who told my wife to leave the store if she didnt want the pastries
When another woman, standing in line behind my wife made a similar inquiry, he was equally rude and unpleasant to her
The owner came out and defended the behavior of the waiter by saying that the fact that they have been in business for 13 years speaks for itself
I wonder what would be possible for these guys if their service and sense of common decency were as great as their pastries are good
Good food but rude waiter diminished the quality of the food with his attitude
Refused our request for a table that was clearly available and made snide remarks right in our faces
Would recommend getting takeout unless you are willing to put up with service that is much to be desired
I was very surprised when I read the reviews on Ceci Cela
I have been living in Nolita for 3+ years, and I have always got an excellent service at this outstanding bakery/cafe
If you stop by Ceci Cela, try the croissants
Almond croissants as well as hamcheese croissants are highly recommended, and must be one of the best you can find in NYC
FYI, most people working at Ceci Cela are from Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and various European countries
I haven't seen many from France yet
I wonder if customers' attitude has something to do with the quality of service they get
I thought the pastries were all right
But you can get better in friendlier (much friendlier) places
It wasn't worth the hassle
My friend's friend had raved about the place, so we went
It wasn't terrible
The pastries were fine, but who needs rude service? Overall a disappointment
There's better with better attitudes
I don't see giving money to people who can't be bothered to be polite
Ceci Cela has really good pastries and cakes

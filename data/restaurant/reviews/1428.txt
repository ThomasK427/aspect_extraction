For main course i had a  Sea Bass and was to die for, and my girlfriend had the fillet mignon which was also very good
Overall, where else can you have raw fish and a great steak with amazing decor and great music!!!!!!!!!!
Last Friday night, i celebrated my birthday with a group of 35 friends! I was really happy to be able to find a place that could actually host so many peoplewith out being in someones home
We made the reservation 5 days before, and were hosted in the downstairs banquet room
We had the whole place for ourselves, with 2 waiters for us
they were great and were able to handle all the orders perfectly
when the food came out, it was very well presented and tasted delicious
We had everything from sushi to tapas to cevich to deserts
I highly recomend it for any party you may want to do
Oh by the way after midnight they moved the tables and we danced all night long, it was just perfect
When i mean best service, i mean best service
I arrived with a group of 9 girlfriends to celebrate my bachelorette party
We had just gone to another place and did not like it, so my friend recomended Kion
We got there afraid we would not be seated and were greeted like queens by one of the owners
inmediatly we were scorted to a private tatami room downstairs, and with our menus were given glasses of champagne to each of us
What else can i say, from that moment on, everything was magical
I highly recomend it to anyone looking for something special or for any event
PS: you must try the gozzila roll and the crispy oysters
This was, hands down, the worst dining experience I have ever had in NYC, and I go out all the time
The staff literally had no idea what was going on
We were a group of 8, and from the second we sat down, nothing went right
Our reservation was at 8pm; forget appetizers, our drinks didn't even get to the table until almost 9pm! We didn't get our dinner until 10pm, and once they brought it out, it was literally all wrong
Some dishes were incorrect, one never even came out
we had three people caring to the table and no one knew what was going on
When we complained, first to the manager, then to the owner, we were told we don't know good restaurants, and we are rude people
What restaurant in NY responds like this?? The food was mediocre and not something worth returning for, even if the service had been fabulous
And as for the owner who turned a deaf ear to our complaints (which were so valid) and sided with his staff, if his temper and demeanor are what he deems appropriate, then the restaurant won't need this review to turn away customers; he'll achieve that all by himself
peruvian and japanese gotta love it!!! food excellent sevice was overall good even though they were super crowded
what to expect on a saturday night i love the decor
futuristic definetly
recommend it highly to any one looking for something different but very relaxing
I will first admit that the food was good overall
Appetizers were small, but the entrees made up for it
(my tuna actually had too many sauces, which overpowered the taste of the tuna)
My one friend ordered a glass of white wine, which came out warm
This was comped
My other friend ordered a mojito
was served in a small glass filled with ice and limes
only about 2 sips of actual drink
i had the smallest martini, which the waiter spilled part of
After waiting 45 minutes for our appetizers, we finally had to ask for them as 2 tables sat after us received their food before us
We had also received someone else's apps on accident
The light behind where we were sitting kept flashing
Had to ask the host to fix it
Also had to ask the host for our apps becasue our waiter was never around
He also left our table before we were finished requesting things
Almost forgot to mention that the manager almost pushed me down the stairs as he flew past me
no appology
Overall, food was good, but the service was horrible
Do not recommend to anyone! (FYI - this is my first posting
felt compelled to offset the great reviews this place has received)
I had to find last-minute restaurant for my girlfriend's birthday and I'm so glad I was able to find Kion
It was a nice change from the typical asian, american, and italian meals we typically have for celebrations
I was able to make a reservation for 17 people three days before her birthday and the best part was I wasn't forced to having a pre-fixe dinner like some of the other restaurants had wanted
The place was certainly trendy and the service was very pleasant and accomodating
They made up for the missed Happy Birthday candle I requested for our desserts by bringing over candles in another dessert without me asking
The food was delicious and presented very well, I especially liked how the Godzilla roll was presented
The meals were certainly adequate as it satisfied my hunger and over some pretty good music
The only thing I would suggest against is having this be a first-date restaurant
The music was way too loud that at times we couldn't hear the waiter and we had to repeat our orders a couple of times
But aside from that I would certainly return and have some of the other dishes especially since it was affordable
Actually, I had anticipated a much larger bill at the end but was happily surprised to see what it came out to be
I recently had my birthday dinner at Kion Dining Lounge and had a wonderful experience
The service was amazing and the food was wonderful
The ceviche is amazing
They took such good care of my friends and I
we all had a wonderful time
They gave us a long table downstairs and allowed us to take our time
I would recommend this place to anyone, whether it's for a large group or a romantic dinner for two
We all absolutely loved it!
Went to Kion last night for a friends b-day and what a great time we had
We were expecting a large party, so they seated us in the blue room downstairs, where you sit on pillows on the floor
When half of our party failed to show up, the waiter, Christian, was not at all rude nor did he try to rush us out from our large table
He was also very helpful when it came to ordering different things on the menu
We had a great time and the food was excellent! If you have a large group (8 or more) make sure to reserve the blue room downstairs!
This place is not worth your time or money
Not only is the atmosphere cold (used to be the old Industry) but you would think this place opened up yesterday because the wait staff is a mess and the owner has no idea how to run a restaurant
I ate here with some friends recently and our entire order was very messed up
The waiters kept coming over to ask us what we ordered and brought out completely wrong dishes
They forgot to make a few of the dishes and were confused when we tried to explain what we ordered
From my seat i could see into the kitchen and they were just very flustered even though the restaurant was empty
The food came out extremely slow and was not even very good
The owner of this restaurant claims to own 7 others throughout the city
Not only was he rude when i tried to explain our situation and how our sushi took an hour to bring out ,but he told us his waitstaff was not wrong and that it was our fault
I cant understand how he is successful in this industry treating customers in such a way
There are so many places to go in this city for tapas and or sushi and for a pleasant dining experience and i would definitely not recommend this place
They clearly have no idea how to run a restaurant so dont waste your time!!
the water bar is only the begining
the sushi beyond fresh
the interior design fabulous
the music mind altering
I chose Kion's because of it's great reviews and I must say they were right! My friends love sushi however I don't
Kion's has a great selection of entrees in addition to its sushi
So even if you're not a Sushi eater you'll still enjoy yourself
I ordered the Stewed Lamb
By far the best Lamb I've ever tasted!! I will definitely be going back!!
I went to Kion with a group of friends a few Saturday's ago, and the place was so good I felt compelled to write my first review! First, the food was excellent: interesting presentations and unique dishes
Second, the value was great; after ordering a ton of food and several drinks, the bill still came to less than $40 a person (though I suspect that the nice manager might have given us a few freebees!)
Third, the atosphere -- especially the blue-light-lit downstairs (which has communal tables and a DJ spinning) was very cool
The place was not crowded, though not empty either

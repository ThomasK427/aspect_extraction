We each ordered overpriced glasses of wine for $10/glass; I've had much better wine for $7-$8/glass
I tried to find solace in a dessert, but none sounded appetizing, so I settled for a depressingly uninspired cookie plate
Savoy is overpriced and an embarrassment to SoHo
I ordered penne primavera, and I received over-cooked rigatoni with vegetables which clearly came from frozen mix
I couldn't eat it
Gross
I have also been to several of Baluchi's restaurants, and I definitely agree that this location consistently has better food and great service
The 50%-off special before 3pm is fantastic deal!
Having been to the other locations, this is my favorite
They must have a better chef but each time I return to the So-Ho location, I'm never let down
The wait staff is much friendlier then say their sister on 2nd Avenue or Uptown where the food will burn your mouth
Begin with the samosa, flakey and spiced perfectly
The chicken tikka masala is creamy, full of tomato and saffron and tender
The naan is flakey and not at all greasy
The price is virtually a steal given its So-Ho location
My only negative comment: what's with the tin cups for water? Leaves a metalic taste in your mouth
Please, regular glasses
So, avoid the other Baluchi's and come Downtown
You'll like it much better
Baluchis is THE best Indian food joint in Manhattan/NYC, and there is little doubt about it
I have tried most of the fancy indian restaurants and the cheap eateries, and the Baluchis chain does the tradition of an affordable gourmet Indian restaurant much justice
The place provides a perfect dinner ambience and comes replete with ornate tables, wall designs, and rural style indian copper glasses
My favorites include the succulent chicken makhani, Rogan Josh (lamb), Baluchis Shrimp Curry and the Paneer bhurji
A good time to visit is during weekend brunch (50% off!!)
If you like this one, you'll love the other similarly modeled Baluchis too
The food lays somewhere on the border or bad and totally mediocre
The spicy tuna roll tasted neither spicy nor even tuna-like
The miso was crappy
Skimpy rolls
Even their chopsticks are crappy
Even for the low price, it's easy to find much better
Got take-out, the miso soup was okay, but didn't have enough goodies
The fish was small, and middling-bad
Low price, but not a good value
In Short The minimalist brick-and-steel decor of this massively popular, original Soho location has carried over to its offshoots in Manhattan and Brooklyn
Tribute gets paid to the restaurant's namesake with 10 kinds of rice and accompanying sauces that border-hop through Pan-Asian, Mexican, Italian and Middle Eastern cuisines
Rounding out the menu are a few special entrees, salads with a choice of seven dressings, and unusual sides like edamame humus and Mayalasian jerky
the service is always friendly and the eclectic mix of flavors is awesome
the prices are incredibly wallet-friendly for the neighborhood and i always leave happy and full
four of us came here for saturday night dinner
seating was cramped but the food more than made up for it
we started with the carrot rice balls in a tomato cumin sauce ($5) they came slightly breaded and drenched in a spicy tomato cumin sauce
we also had the edamame hummus ($3) which was served cold it tasted much more like hummus than edamame, but the smooth creaminess went well with the round of fluffy warm pita bread
for my main course, i had the vegetarian meatballs ($5, made with tofu in a spicy sweet sour sauce) with their special green rice (long grain basmati infused with spinach, parsley, cilantro, and pinenuts)
get the passion fruit tapioca ($3
50) for dessert the tartness balances the heaviness of the carb-ladden meal well
i definitely want to come back and try another special rice grain next time
My friend and I tried this place after watching a review on TimeOut NY
It was SUPPOSED to be a good cheap eats place
First of all, we had to wait forever for the food
They have a tiny kitchen so they take forever to cook anything
Second, the food is very mediocre
My friend had the Vietnamese pho
It was a very small portion and overpriced at $8
The re were two thinly sliced pieces of meat and very few noodles too
I ordered the Indian Curry and while that tasted ok, it was by no means an experience that would make me want to go back again
In fact, the portion sizes were so small we walked over to Chinatown to grab a bite to eat afterwards
Nothing like using iceberg lettuce, cooked chicken and a tangy salad dressing just to put a fancy name like Vietnamese Lemon Grass Chicken on an overpriced dish
One can spend half the amount of money and get twice as much quality food at one of hundreds of good Chinese/Asian restaurants nearby in Chinatown
this place is great
I currently have about 5 favorite dishes with different rice
I go for the mexican chicken soup - packed with corn, shredded chicken, rice and avacados
yummy
their thai and indian curry is really good too, depending on what i'm in the mood for
The lemongrass chicken is so yummy too
Restaurant is a little small, but we are in manhattan after all
Take out and delivery is next door and usually will be better if you are looking to get your food faster
Sometimes in the summer, i'll get my food in a bowl and sit outside on a bench
If you are looking for some Asian food around soho this is an average, but slightly overpriced choice
I tried the paradoxically named vegetarian meatballs and pad thai there recently
They were decent, although they both had a somewhat homogenous flavor
Ended up spending just south of $20, which is a bit much, considering the average food quality
Service was friendly though
Rice offered a lot of unusual rice - bhutan, red beans, and I suggest you spend the extra 50c or $1 to get this
I love the menu, as it's eclectic and offer different from your average Chinese/Indian/Thai dishes
The small size is usually enough to fill me up
The downside is that perhaps due to rice's eclectic nature, the chef has trouble cooking any single type to perfection
Also, they give you way more rice and far less topping
However, it's such a good value for different food I can overlook it
i come here almost everyweek, thai curry chicken w/ rice and peas! Place is small but perfect size
Great place for lunch, or a light meal
Prices are great! all small bowls are under 10 w/ tax+tip
try the tiger shrimp balls also!
LOVE THIS PLACE!
everything great but their service (waitresses usually) sometime is annoying and snotty
all else cool and recommended, very simple food and nice ambience
I came here with friends a few times and I keep coming back
I love the choices in rice flavors and the small (vs
the large) dishes usually fill me up
Plus, though small and a little cramped, they really make the most out of the space they have
Try the beef jerky - like chinatown's own homemade!!!
If you're looking for a great place to bring your friends or just for excellent food, this posh little place has it all- music, lighting, decor, and most importantly
great food! The waitresses are very nice and although there's usually a wait, it's well worth it!
i adore this place - get the vegetarian meatballs!  (i am quite confused by the last two reviews, as i always leave Rice full and with money in my pocket!)
the food is tasty
but for the money you pay, you end up being hungry still
If I want the kids size/portion, I'll go to McDonalds
I don't need a buffet, but I'd like my food to at least fill me up without having to order something else after I'm done
Pathetic
This is the only way to describe the meals

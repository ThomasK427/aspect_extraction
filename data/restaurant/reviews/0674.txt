Go here for a fun time!
Great value (food and beverages- very reasonable), location, nice back outdoor patio area, and DJ
Get their early or have patience
The place is not big
It will be worth the wait!!! Cash only!!!
it's reeeally cheap
heaping portions of calamari, spicy squid salad, spare rib, etc
all for $7 or less
crazy
fun atmosphere, it's trendy and the music is good
but service was lacking and most of the dishes were eh
pad thai didn't taste right, mussels (according to my friends, i didn't have any) were bad, chicken was just ok
the squid salad and ribs were good though
also, drinks were not strong (but i didn't mind so much)
it's so inexpensive that i'll probably return though
very friendly service, the best dim sum, light and spicy
Not the best eating around, but you can get a pretty good meal for a pretty low price
We probably go there a few times a month
It's definitely a good value
This is one of my favorite Thai places in the neighborhood, but don't go Friday or Saturday when it's ridiculously crowded
The spicy basil noodle dish is my favorite
They are willing to make dishes extra spicy here, too
after trying several thai spots in manhattan and brooklyn by testing a staple such as toam yum
two mushrooms in watered down sweet and sour sauce?? ack,, i found joya in brooklyn to be above and beyond other thai spot that ive tried in the area
while some dishes may suffice, many excel
my favorite dish being the spicy noodles

excuse me i have to stop this review because im salivating too much
if you dont like the atmosphere, get it to go
You can't beat the pricing this place offers for their Thai cuisine
They offer the basic standard Thai menu: Pad Thai noodles, curried meats, Thai iced tea and the like, and they do offer some Thai-fusion entrees as well
I have not tried all of their dishes yet, but the ones I have tasted are good
The staff is friendly and the decor is pleasant
There is a bar right by the door, which is convenient while waiting in the long lines for a seat and be prepared to wait on the weekends
Overall, the value is great and is worth the trip down to Brooklyn
My friends in Manhattan rarely come out to Brooklyn
I convinced them to cross the river and go to Joya with me
The are hooked!!! So many times you go out in Manhattan and a meal cost and arm and a leg and it is awful! Joya is soooo cheap and the food is wonderful
They have a wide selection and great specials
I am not sure what negative reviewers had to eat, but since I live close by and eat there all the time, I have never had a less-than-wonderful experience at Joya
My favorite salad is the mango salad - the best I've ever had
And the rest of the food is delicious and fresh
Nothing is expensive, the service is quick and courteous, the live music never fails, and the overall ambience creates a fantastic and tasty dining experience
This isn't a quiet 'romantic' place, it is hip and loud and sleek
So if you want to have an 'intimate' dinner where you can only hear the other person's voice, maybe this isn't the place
However, for a friendly get-together where noise becomes part of the energy that feeds you, Joya is the way to go!!
It is definitely one of my favourites
I have taken all of my friends and collagues atleast once over there, and everytime the food is great
If i dont go there once a month , i start getting withdrawl symptoms
Joya is simply the best Thai you will find in all of Brooklyn and NYC - Possibly all 5 borroughs
The fresh, large portions are just delightful, you're likely to try almost everything on this unlimited menu
Not only do they have large portions, but GREAT specials everyday
They'll even let you re-vamp their entrees to your liking if need be
Joya is the type of restaurant you can go to multiple times a week
Their food - SUPERB
Their drinks - fairly priced, large and refreshing
The atmosphere a plus
Young crowd in for some good food and great service!
This is some of the best Thai food I've found in NYC
Not only is it fresh, well prepared and just plain delicious - it's incredibly reasonable in price (large portions, too!)
The restaurant itself is funky and trendy without trying - check out the garden seating during good weather
Try the mango martinis - they're AMAZING!
I was almost scared off by crowd and the impossible promises of well-cooked and cheap Thai food in a great setting, but this place really delivered
The service was barely passable, but my food -- fried cod with green papaya salad -- was perfectly cooked
It was easily as good as any seafood dish I've had at $100-a-head restaurants
Didn't try the noodles or curries, so can't comment on their quality/authenticity, but next time
Yea, the place looks great
i will give you that
But please, the food is so 'blah' it's not even funny
This is another one of the increasing number of boring thai places - i fear they are taming down their tastes and ingrediants for americans
I heard about Joya through a few friends of mine at school and had heard nothing but good things about the place
The Thai food here is quite good and the prices are very reasonable
The atmosphere was laid back and the crowd was very mixed
I expected entrees to be at least in the $15-20 range, but most of the entrees on the menu were under $10
The specials menu had items ranging from around $12-15 dollars
All the food sounded good so it took me a while to pick out my red curry dish and an appetizer of calamari
they were both quite good
They had a limited wine and beer selection, but the bottle of Echelon Merlot was pretty decent and priced at only $21
Luckily, I made reservations for our group or else it would have been a long wait
Check this place out!
The food here was some of the best Tai food I have ever had
A large dissapointment came at the end of the meal, however, when i found a large piece of chicken in my vegetarian entree
The staff was very appologetic and comp'ed the meal
so tasty, especially the grilled coconut corn on the cob starter
it was very crowded but you can always sit at the back counter if there's only two of you
noodles and curry were both yummy
My favorite restaurant in Cobble Hill is also, conveniently, among the chaepest
Imagine, if you will, a restaurant with most entrees under $10, food that is tasty and made from quality ingredients, and has a great ambience (with DJ, most nights)
Sometimes it gets crowded, but the maitre d' makes sure everyone is kept track of, and the wait is never as long as it looks
Definitely make a reservation for any group larger than 4
I've lived in the Cobble Hill/Brooklyn Heights area for about 15 years
I'm glad to see restaurants such as Joya opening and flourishing
The food is very good
The best Masaman curry I've had
The Tofu Tod and the summer rolls are nice
They have a dish called Druken Noodles that is often not on the menu, but is great--ask for it
Lively bar scene and a very nice rear outdoor desk in the summertime for dining under the trees
The only drawback is that it gets crowded and very noisy because of the minimalist concrete floors and walls
This bar has it all - great drinks, cool atmosphere, excellent service and delicious food
There's always something going on at this place

I live in the area
I had a great hamburger there and the food is good in general
BUT
they charge $3
50 for an iced coffee and there are no free refills so we ended up paying $7 for iced coffee
Oh
but there were free refills on the iced tea
Ridiculous!
I went here the week it opened
It was very cute, with a 40s diner feel
The service was on point
Had the mac n cheese with chorizo as an appetizer, enough for two
Nice mixture of cheese, not too overwhelming, very good
My friend and I both had burgers
I am very picky about burgers and these were great
It is a great inexpensive spot right in the heart of the overpriced Meatpacking area
Plan on going there whenever we are in the area
I thought my girlfriend and I got to Aer on time this past weekend, but the lines were so long we walked off
Trying to get a table at Spice Market was equally futile, and we were about to go back home, but we stumbled upon the Diner
What a refreshing spot! Very down to earth, and very friendly service
The burgers were great, but the mac and cheese will have us coming back often
Even with desserts we managed to eat very well and not do a lot of wallet damage
too spicy, too salty, too fatty, yucky fishy smell
small table, crowded
all my friends are giving negative feedback
will never go back again
but service is good though
poor quality of food
don't think white chefs can cook authentic malaysian
they don't know what's the authentic taste
rather go to jaya in china town
Small, dark over crowded
Our server suggested that we get a few plates and share the food
We ordered the duck, chicken pot and something that came with a poached egg
The dishes were not conducive to sharing at all
The duck came in huge chunks that you couldn't cut (we weren't given knives so this was a problem) it was fatty and had little meat
The egg dish came with some kind of unidentifiable, spicy, fishy substance that was just repulsive
We were seated outside in the darkness, cramped with other patrons sitting right on top of you
No table space and one of the angry neighbors decided to take matters into his own hands by throwing a bucket of water out his window and onto the patrons waiting for their tables
The staff did nothing but stand outside the apartment, hands on hips while patrons dried themselves
I went for the first time on Thursday night and saw that softshell crabs had just come into season! The crabs were tender and delicious and sat on top of some spicy sauce that really complimented the flavor well, and was not overpowering
The service and ambience were nice and the wait for a table was only 20 minutes
Every dish was full of flavor and spice
All at a very reasonable price
Dined late Saturday afternoon
The Chili Crab was spicy and delicious and the staff was attentive and gorgeous
The food was incredible, order the coconut skate and sop it up with rice
And if you love flavor, the spicy/sour noodle soup was large, tasty, and is an adventure for your mouth (little fried fish, squishy noodles, broth,Yum)
Ok
I agree, the place is teeny
(NO GROUPS, please!)   But if you want space in this neighborhood you'll have to shell out $50/person to eat at Ono
Or, like we wanted to tell the snotty spinsters sitting next to (or rather on top) of us, Want more Space
?Move to California
And the servers were so cute, you WANT an excuse to flag them over to ask for that extra plate
It's dark and tightly cramped and way too loud but go there for the the food - its out of this world! We started with the most awesome pork belly tea sandwiches - soft and succulent and exotic quail egg shooters which are raw quail eggs in shell with a little chili powder and dried spicy fish
what a treat for the tastebuds
Mussels arrived, swimming in lime and mint and then the crabbbb
oh the crabbb
poetry should be written about that crab
Dig in and watch your elbows lest you knock over your neighbors glass!
It was just ok
There are some dishes that are delicious, but not wow
I still would dine here again when I am looking for an affordable casual meal
The staff was very friendly
Be prepared to make friends with the people sitting next to you, tight seating
It is a hands on eating experience for some of the dishes
I really wanted to enjoy their specialty crab dish, but too much work had to go into cracking the crab legs
the fatty duck, beef rib rendang and kang kung hit the right spot! from the juiciness of the duck to the spiciness of the beef and the sweetness of the rice
it all worked well together
im glad i've finally visited this place
will come back for a late meal next time since they close at 4 :)
When we first walked in, I liked the ambience
We finally were able to stop one of the too-busy-for-you waiters and were seated at the front
At first, our waiter was very nice and attentive
Then some of his too fabulous friends showed up
He seated them next to us
The girl seated next to me seemed to prefer to be more in my lap than in her own seat
Our waiter catered to his friends and forgot our requests for water refills and our side orders of rice
The food was fine, but I expected better quality for these prices and all the hype
The crab was definitely not as good as fatty crab i've had other places and certainly not worth the price
Fatty Crab is just another over-priced scene that will soon blend in with the rest of the meatpacking district
Snotty 'tude makes the Crab just plain rude
Though the dishes we tried were tasty (all that salt no doubt), the attitude of the waitstaff ruined what should have been a fun, food experience
As we were wrapping up a very rushed meal--appetizers were barely started when the entrees arrived crowding a table for two at which three were crammed--the hostess charged over and grabbed a half-full wine glass declaring thanks ladies, I'll get your check
This salvo was followed up by two waiters looming over our table and attempting to shoo us out be wiping imaginary crumbs and fussing with our water glasses
In 13 years of eating out in NYC I've never been chased from a table, it was so blatantly rude it was comical
We won't be going back
the food is truly fresh and delicious, the crab is hauntingly yummy cannot wait to go back for more
for me, who prefers fish and veggies over meat, I swooned over the short ribs, the veggies, the FREE little yummy surprise dessert
the service was nothing short of wonderful and I loved everything about this little place - will recommend it to all of our foodie friends
Been here three times
If you can swallow the scenester vibe and all the kool people, then the food will please
I love spice and the kitchen was more than accommodating to my requests to make it extra spicey
So for me, that alone gets raves
The food is good, but dont expect family style portions, they are not going for that crowd
The crowd you do get is loud
Service can be spotty, but they try
Reservations are no guarantee of prompt seating, have a pre-game drink, pop a xanax and you can handle the drama of having a res and getting no love from the hostess
If your in the Meatpacking District, sadly that is the order of the day
Seriously, do NOT believe the hype on this one! This is the most overrated new place in the city, talk about cranking out their own publicity - EVERYWHERE! I had a similar experience to other reviewers here

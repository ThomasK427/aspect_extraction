This is an example of the vastly over-priced and very unauthentic Mexican food served at this restaurant
In this day and age, particularly with the widespread availability of quality Mexican ingredients, I expect to at least get Mexican cheese on my entrees, not mozarella
Give this one a pass, there is far better ACTUAL Mexican food available in New York at significantly better prices
DON'T BELIEVE THEIR OVERALL RATING!!! The place is nicely designed and THATS IT !!! It's LOUD (large space with screaming kids and music too low to hear), EXPENSIVE (burritos are $17 !) the service is pushy and the food looks good but is completely average (chewy steak, tasteless rice and beans)
There are SO many better Mexican places out there! I think the only reason it's busy is because of it's location and upscale design
Oh, one more thing - my wife asked for her nachos with ground beef versus chicken and they charged us an extra $3
00 for the substitution! (even though ground beef costs less than chicken)
I've been here a few times (although not in the last 2 years), and used to think it was good
I went this past week, and it was a nightmare
The waiter brought the wrong food and charged us for food and drinks we didn't order
The manager didn't believe us when we contested our bill
The manager was so argumentative and unprofessional, he was verbally abusive and almost became physically violent
This place was so good
I enjoyed every bite of m chimichangas
The guacomole is so tasty and spicy and best of all made fresh on the spot
The margharitas are great and the service is fast and attentive
There is no waiting an hour for your food to come
Try it
you won't regret it
I went to dine at Mama Mexico, with hopes that it would live upto all the awards that they have on there walls
Unfortunetly, that was not the case the service was terrible, we were rushed to choose our appetizer without even having a menu to choose from, given flat soft drinks, and then not given enough time to choose our entrees
I ordred the tamales, and my husband ordered the tacos, when I recieved my entree, the tamales were like 2 pieces of brick with sprinkled cheese on top, the beans were dry and had no flavor
The taco dish, was horrible as well the tacos, were soggy and again with dry beans
With so many great Mexican places open in the city why do keep these disgusting places open?????????????????????
I went with a group of friends - the guacamole was great but the mango margarita tasted like medicine
When we asked to exchange the margarita, the pitcher was taken away and we were told by the manager that we could no longer order ANY margarita
He kept on saying that they all taste like this
This type of service is unacceptable especially when you have so many other equally good mexican options in the city
The people writing good reviews for this place must be getting paid
Apparently making a reservation for 2 for 7p
m
is too much to ask for so we waited for 1/2 hour
Then we were seated at this somewhat isolated table and were thankful because every other table seemed cramped
Oh, but that didn't last long
We were asked to move ourselves (with our drinks and chips) to a another table because the one we were at was reserved
At this point we were totally disgusted and cramped
The tables are so close together you have no choice but to strike up a conversation with the strangers next to you
We complained to the manager and he offered to move us (nope, no discount)
We order the special (seafood stuffed red snapper) and aseafood rice dish, which were nothing special
I would never send anyone to this place
Be very careful if you bring a group here
My group got charged an outrageuos $63/person for a family-style dinner, including a 23% tip added for the horrible service
They really ripped us off, and they kept bringing pitchers of margaritas even after we said, no more
The food is miserable, not better than the greasy, slimy Mexican served anywhere else at 1/10 of the price here
The cheesy mariachi band and the guy pouring tequila are the only saving graces
Don't go, and don't ever bring a group
This place is loud, and by loud, I do mean that you might have to scream at your dinner-mate over the music, but despite the noise, it's obvious that everyone is having a good time
It's a festive and jolly place
Fast-paced
Even though you might be seated right next to another group, you feel as if you have your own space
Margaritas by the pitcher are delicious, if not a bit expensive
But don't get suckered when they come to your table and say guacamole? it's $10 and the salsa they're about to plunk down is free
Stopped in here for lunch a few weeks ago - the place was nearly empty
Service was good but not great - would probably be lackluster if it were really busy
My friend and I had guacamole and the fajita special, both of which were tasty enough but really nothing to write home about
Prices seemed a little on the high side, but not terrible
All in all, it's a good spot to stop in if you need a meal in this 'hood
I've invited everyone and haven't heard one complaint yet
When I go to a restaurant I HAVE TO CHECK OUT THE RESTROOM: Mama Mexico: spotless well appointed
The restaurant is clean, vibrant, colorfol, original artwork with a happy happy joy joy feeling
Service is pleasant attentive
I've been there several times and never felt rushed even if it's busy
The restaurant has expanded over the years has greatly improved
There are semi-divided areas where large groups, couples families can all feel comfortable
The Pineapple Tequila: out of this world: VERY DANGEROUS because it's SOOO GOOOOOOD
Food: delicious, creative, nicely presented, isn't like mom's/grandma's kitchen (that authentic) but it's delicious nonetheless
Topping it off: the Mariachi's who take requests, whenever they start playing patrons start singing along before you know it the whole restaurant is singing!!!! Lots of fun still romantic
My girlfriends and I went there last night and we had a great time
We got seated as soon as we got in
The ambiance and the mariachi was superb
The food is really good and you MUST try their frozen margaritas, they're to die for
The manager bought us a round of pineapple tequilas (you must try) and then came around to pour tequila straight from the bottle
It's great to go with a group
We had a blast, it was great!
In three words or less, to-die-for
That's how I would describe Mama Mexico's Fried Ice-cream
It's wonderful
I won't give away the details, that would be no fun
I will only say this, creamy vanilla ice-cream, chocolate syrup, a cherry and some think ???? You will not be disappointed
Enjoy!!!
Polite staff, pretty good food, and I should know, as I eat out almost everyday
Expect waits when a place is popular in Manhattan, even w/ reservations
The staff treats customers the way customers treat the staff
If you're rude, they're rude
If you're nice, they'll treat you like kings
2 parties didn't have everyone their reservation, and waited until everyone arrived to be seated
That's common at almost every single restaurant in Manhattan
They've got to run a business and can't wait around with empty table's while people wait outside
Our experience there would've probably been quite amazing, if it hadn't been for the rude patrons sitting next to us
As for the food, it's absolutely amazing
Even crowded, their timing was good
We weren't rushed, they weren't slow
Had a late lunch on a Friday - food and service were great
Margaritas were even better
Fresh salsa and guacamole (they'll make the guac at your table), we had a few things and all were very good
No words can fully describe the dining experience at this Mexican paradise
You will be welcomed with friendly service, a strolling mariachi band, authentic food and the best fresh guacamole on the planet
A MUST for all who like entertainment with excellent food
I go all the time!!!
Loud music from the mariachis and a festive atmosphere make this a great place to go for a pitcher of sangria and some Mexican food

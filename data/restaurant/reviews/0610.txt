Lupa, which is slightly more expensive, is a much better experience for the money
I would never go back for the sub-par entrees or pizza served, but would definitely go back to hang out in the front bar-room area, which is excellent for meeting up with people for a drink and having some appetizers
The wine list is great, and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly when helping to choose a bottle
The highlight of the menu was the brussel sprout app while we were waiting for our table in the front room
Took my girlfriend to this place for dinner the other night
Everyone there was incredibly rude to us all night; really the worst service I've ever seen at a restaurant
Food was mediocre, and all the pizzas were covered in this butter glaze that made me nauseous
With so many great restaurants in New York, don't waste your time with this one
4 of us went and had reservations
The hostess couldn't have been ruder from the moment we walked in
We stayed and enjoyed a great meal of appetizers and lots of wine
An unexpected guest came by, grabbed an extra chair and sat down to order with us
We were planning on eating more with the guest and drinking a lot more
Another hostess came by and told us that since we were now 5 we were a different table and couldnt' stay
She didn't care that we weren't even done yet
We tried to be nice and explain the situation, but she didn't care
So we skipped more food and wine and got the heck out
The wine list is great, the food was good but I'll actually never go back there again because the service was so bad
There is nothing positive I can say about this place
Everything from service to food was just awful
I am shocked that there are any positive comments here!
It is too bad that the bartenders' rude behavior and pathetic service will cost this otherwise fun and yummy restaurant valuable business
Batali and Bastianich bring Italia to NYC
Nobody does it better
If you want to go out for fine Italian Dining, go to Babbo or Del Posto
Otto is a Enoteca (Wine Bar) that serves great food
That is the way you need to approach Otto to really get the most out of it
The food is simple and authentic, that's what Batali does best
The wine list is as good as it gets when it comes to Italian wine
They feature over 700 bottles, and I have yet to drink a bad bottle
It is fun to go with a large party
However if you have more then 11 in your party you are forced to chose from the group dining menu, which is limited and excludes pasta
My biggest negative about Otto is the host staff and seating policy
Make sure to try the Italian Meats and Gelato
friend in from L
A
booked reservations for 7ppl
horrible mistake
RUDE hostess
reservations for 7:00 for 7 people got us seated at 7:45
waited 18 minutes before anyone offered us water!! THEN another 15 minutes before anyone came for our dinner order
first waiter brought us wrong wine, second and third waiter never brought us the sides we asked for
Poor staff coomunication=us being ignored
only redeeming quality was amazing dessert
olive oil gelato, it was superb
but the pizzas were sub standard
basil and roma tomato pizza came with 4 puny pieces of basil and the bottom was raw dough
ick
very disappointed
will not go back and i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys dining out
truly awful service and unimpressive food
worse=no apologies
you go for the amazing wine list, antipasti, meats cheeses, and above all, the best gelato that I have found in NYC
I returned there just last weekend to sit at the bar and have gelato
I do not understand why their pizza crust is the way it is, like a thin pita bread
The toppings are good, but I really dislike the crust
After reading the numerous reviews, I have to strongly disagree
The place is packed 7 nights a week for a reason
The pizza's are amazing, especially the egg pizza (I'm addicted to it)
When in season the buffalo mazzarella is the best I've ever had (and I was born in Italy)
It's one of te best bar scenes not packed with kids just a great 30 something crowd (what a pleasure)
My only complaint at the bar is, they tend to rush you once they think your done with drinking/eating
They like to get the next person in your seat as quickly as possible
Beside that it's a great eating experience!
Otto is one of my favorite restaurants in the city
First, the wine list is spectacular
They have all regions of Italy covered (the piemonte selection is my favorite), and the prices are very reasonable
Get a couple quartini (glass-and-a-half) for sampling
They change the selection of quartini regularly
Second, the cheese plate and other antipasti are delicious, and great for sharing
The cheese plate comes with three condiments (truffle honey, chili-flecked apricots, and cherries) that add zing to the high-quality cheese
Third, the gelato (especially olive oil and hazelnut stracitella) are out of this world
My favorite thing to do at Otto is grab a seat at the bar (knowledgeable staff, fun and lively atmosphere), order some wine and cheese, and people watch
Don't go on a weekend night because it is packed -- better to go on a Tuesday or Wednesday
The four of us went there for lunch during the week to try out one of the 8 venues by Mr
Mario Batali
Overall, it was a good experience
All of us ordered an individual pizza - unique toppings on a pita bread
They were well prepared and a lot of the toppings were truly unique compared to some of the common ones you come across
They were also a lot of other good items on the menu, so there are options if you want to order something other than a pizza
The only thing that I wouldn't recommend is the pizza with otto lardo topping
(pork fat) Although it sounds unique and unusual, you can't really taste anything except the pita bread
My suggestion there would be for them to add something else to it - i
e
sea/kosher salt, truffle mushrooms, etc
Nice space with a good vibe
The wait staff was friendly and attentive
But all the food was much too aggressively salted
The clams on my pizza actually tasted more like anchovies
I've been to Italy 5 or 6 times - and don't remember ever having food this salty
I wrote a review about a year ago; I reread my review; ALL of it still holds true; read on:  I didn't even stick around after I waited over forty five minutes for a table at 10:30 PM, on a Tuesday night
I've read some of the reviews and this place has NOTHING to do with italy, except that it's like the tourist traps I avoid in Rome
It was noisy, I couldn't even hear my partner sitting across from me AND they pulled that same, we're out of your wine business
No surprise
Who wants to order a $60 bottle of wine with pizza? Especially, the soggy looking type
You want real pizza and wine, go to Trastevere in Rome and pick any restaurant near Santa Maria
It will be worth the airfare alone! Save your money and your ticket from this place for the real stuff later
what a terrible experience! my family and i were there to celebrate my 8-year-old son's birthday
he loves this place
however, it was a disaster

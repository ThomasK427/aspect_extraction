We wouldn't have had a problem with this if the burger had actually been tasty but even with the foie-gras, cheddar cheese, apple smoked bacon, leaks, etc
the burger was still pretty dull
Overall, for a place that is known solely for their burgers, it was a complete disappointment
We called on a busy Friday night for delivery and they were gracious, helpful and prompt
It was our first time having food from Hampton Chutney, and we were pleasantly surprised! The dosa's were interesting, delicous and filling
My tomato chutney was superb
I also tried the declicious seasonal watermelon juice (perfect), the orange/ginger iced tea (strong, but great), and the cardamom iced coffee (again, strong but interesting and great)
I highly recommend it!
Felt like a mix between Rome and NYC - fantastic! Amazing pizza and salads
Service was a bit slow, but still friendly
Very cool atmosphere - perfect for dinner outside on a hot summer night
Highly recommended
As residents, my BF and I try LES establishments with frequency and open minds
We were attracted by PALA's breezy open-air garage doors
Our server refused to give us eye contact while rattling off a snobby, lifeless presentation of PALA crust preparation (25 MINUTE COOKING TIME)
A mozzarella-stuffed zucchini flower appetizer was actually 4 shriveled, oily bricks -- $10
A $6 glass of wine was a pathetic pour
and then, there's the pizza
it's a tall order to SCREW UP a classic margherita pizza -- but this was a mess
the crust PALA touts as their selling point is absolutely miserable
the sauce had no flavor
and the bill after all of this? $70 FOR 2 PEOPLE FOR DINNER
The manager, typical machissimo italian businessman, sat outside with his chef scowling and smoking -- an uncomfortable dining experience
NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY
The filling Roman-style pies can be split amongst your group without breaking the bank
You'll only need a couple slices to tide you over
You'll really want more, though--especially the Umbriaca/Umbrica (?)
so so tasty
Space is slightly boring though, and you'll come across a wait unless you luck out
I just want to say that this place is absolutely phenomenal
I vouch 100%
Great Pizza! I had their special which was funghi (mushrooms) and prosciutto
It was amazing, and they serve you in generous portions
The antipasti was also great (They handle it REALLY well on the eggplant, and the zuchini isn't bad either)
Great staff, great service, enjoy this place!
We had the Zucca and fresh mozarella pizza
Pizza was great, fresh high quality ingredients
Great wine selection too
Try the sparkling red lambrusca
The Rockefeller Center location is unparalled
The outdoor seating provides spectacular views
The service, however, is unacceptable
Our waiter was CLUELESS! He wasn't familar with the items on the menu and it took him several attempts before he finally brought the type of beer that we actually ordered
I had several waiters that were literally stumbling over me while I was trying to dine
The food, however is spectacular
The beef shortrib, Beef Bourguignonne as well as the Gratin Dauphinois are to die for
While the recently added outdoor seating was what drew me and my friend to the restaurant, the food, service and overall experience were what drove us out! Our original waiter suddenly stopped serving us (while continuing to serve other tables) and another waiter seemed to take his place-without us being informed! we ordered simple salads, which were outrageous in price and def
not worth the cost, were not even served at the same time! There are plenty of other outdoor seatings in the midtown area that i've enjoyed much more than this one
i'll def
be telling my friends to skip this one!
My wife and I have eaten dinner at Brasserie Ruhlmann four times in the past month with different couples each time and we've all loved it
Every meal has been fantastic, and we have always had terrific service
The design of the restaurant is beautiful, and the outdoor seating should be a welcome addition to Rock Center in the Spring/summer
Love it, love it!
I went there for lunch with co-workers and found the service to be prompt and very friendly
The food was tasty and the prices VERY reasonable
Alana is the best/ guest bartender from Fairfield University and is not only the most beautiful bartender but she is also excellent at the Cosmo of the century and some Malibu cocktail - MisabellaCocktail - ;-) ENJOY great atmosphere!!
I was impressed with this place when we initially arrived, although the door staff / hostess gave us mega attitude
The food was fantastic, as was our server
(I highly recommend the bread pudding for dessert!)
However by the end of the night the bar area was hopping, which was fine if you were there for that, but the noise was not contained to the bar area at all, despite there being a door separating the food and drinking areas
So it was hard to hear our dinner conversation! And getting out of the place was ridiculous, we had to shove through throngs of people in the bar (mostly drunk at this point)
I agree with separate areas for food and drink, but there should be a better layout when it comes to arriving and leaving
I would totally check it out as a bar though, it seemed fun
I met a client here and wasn't expecting much but after the lunch was over, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the meal and the price point
I had tuna over a salad and it must have been an entire tuna steak
we had cokes, coffee and two salads for $30
In mid town manhattan, that's a good deal for a white table clothed restaurant
There were more expensive main heavier meals and they appeared to be worth it as they were carried to their respective tables
Overall, a great meal at a great price and our waitress was very attentive and timely
I've only been to the place once and my over all experience was a good one
Not a great one but definitely a good one
It was brighter than usual but the crowd really didn't seem to mind much as the DJ kept them moving
It was a good pit stop for a bunch of friends on a Sat
night
As most New Yorkers know most bars in the city are just a pit stop
I wish the investors luck
I don't know any of them personally but I would never trash them publicly like the review below has
Telling your friends in person take a lot more courage than
mmm will ever know
Keep your money and I bet your friends do just fine
Take it from an unrelated experienced investor that knows what he is taking about
I met some friends here after work last week - had a GREAT time
Great energy, one of those places that seems like you'll always have fun
We were only supposed to meet there and we ended up staying all night
As for the past review - what's wrong with getting some personal attention from an investor in a restaurant or bar? It's called customer service? At least they care about their business
I will be going back for sure
Can I offer some words of advice
never introduce yourself to me as an investor and insist on a handshake
I'm talking to my friends
When deciding on whether to buy another TV monitor (they have 7) or investing in lighting/sound system, Please pay a little attention to the latter two or the experience feels like drinking in an overlit library for people with ADD, yelling to make yourself heard
Please don't hand me a menu of food that will be on offer in the future I'm hungry now and nachos won't cut it
Finally, don't put a meathead on the door to block my way in and out
you're not a nightclub or even a lounge
It's 7pm on a Wednesday and you're a bar
Good luck fellas
I could have invested plenty of money here, but won't be
A great new addition to Murray Hill
Classy joint with terrific food
Great place for Happy Hour

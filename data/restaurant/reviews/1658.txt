The dowstairs has live jazz music which is a nice setting
The main floor is good when the weather is nice --there are french doors that lead to outside seating
And the upstairs has a great overlook
Just a few recommendations: the chopped salad, the crab cakes, the seafood tower, any seafood special, the sweet potato fries and you MUST get the warm chocolate oooooze cake w/vanilla ice cream for dessert
great ambience, service and spectacular food
the seafood was fresh with just the right touch of condiments
reasonably priced for their high qualities
We went on Christmas Eve and the food was delicious and service excellent
We sat in the Jazz room and had a lovely evening
The chopped salad is great, same as the other BR Guest restaurants
Highly recommend the lobster roll as an appetizer, for an entree the sauteed lobster and scallops dish and the banana ice cream tower for dessert
Very average and extremely disappointing
I was visiting from out of town and received a recommendation from a local
Service was by far the most disappointing
Two tables sat after us and were served water and drinks before the waiter even visited our table
Then the service went into high gear with multiple orders, appitizers and salads all coming out at once
For a dining experience, I would NOT recommend
If the food was amazing, we could could have forgiven the service, but even that was ho-hum

This restaurant is totally overrated
The crabcakes were oily, and our entrees were cold
They even tried to charge us for a dish that never came
After we pointed this out, they put up a fight and argued that we ordered it
Yes, but you never served it to us! We will never come back to this restaurant again
We had a big group here for a Saturday night dinner; our table was ready ~15 minutes later than the reservation time (pretty good for a busy night) and our server was excellent the entire time
The main floor space is lovely, but cavernous (which means *VERY* noisy), so our server was especially patient with us since we couldn't hear each other or her half the time
The food is pretty bland, but by no means bad
We had some good oysters and a few good fish dishes
At least they price their food moderately, so you don't feel ripped off
This is definitely a good place for drinks and is festive this time of year
The first time was a disappointing, overpriced crowded diner
However, brunch is a good value for this atmospher
Make a reservation, and if possible grab a seat outside, even on cool days the heat torches work great
Order Crab cakes egg benidict
The food is good, but waaaay overpriced
I mean it's basically a wall street crowd with prices to match
You can easily get a lobster in Chinatown that's the same quality but half the price
I don't think it's worth it
I had always wanted to try this restaurant, ever since my girlfriend told me about it and especially after I read the reviews on CitySearch and other websites
I was overwhelmed
Try the lobster bisque, it's especially creamy and rich
The soy-wasabi Chilean Sea Bass is better than you can imagine
With the soy, wasabi, ginger, and sticky rice, it's easy to imagine this is sushi
Our dinner was enhanced by a 1999 Pinot Grigio, recmmended by the waitress
I cannot wait until I go back there
One of my favorite places to eat and people watch
The service is wonderful and the food is great
Blue Water Grill is by far one of the better sea food restaurants I have visited, the food is fresh, the ambiance very swanky and the service equally good, except for the long wait, even if you have a reservation, and the very popular restaurant will keep up its image by making you wait for a table, no matter what! But the food is exceptional and definitely worth the wait! Visit its brother restaurants uptwon, Atlantic Grill and Ocean Grill, a wee bit even better!
AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! There are not enough good things i can say about this stellar restaurant! We were seated in the Jazz room, and the ambiance was posh yet casual with a light amount of background jazz music that gave the whole place a warm aura
The salad, appetizer, entree, and desert were all fall-on-the-floor to die for! nd the service was exceptionall as well
This is the best place for either a cozy date or a lively family gathering
Blue Water Grill takes the cake!
if you like very loud music, or have a date you don't feel like talking to, this is the place to go
the service is so-so; our waiter told us there was a table for us, then took us back to the entrance , we then waited another fifteen minutes- confusion seems to reign
the bartender had no clue how to make a manhattan
this is a good restaurant for people watching of wannabe trendies, the food is good but the lousy service and decibel level ruined it
maybe the other levels are better but the first floor is just too loud
EXCELLENT LUNCH! Appatisers are the way to go! The steamed (SHRIMP) dumplings were out of this world,and if you like sushi the salmon balls, and the spicy tuna totally impressed my husband (his initial thought being,probaly another over price so/so tourist trap)
Just thinking about their LOBSTER BISQUE makes my mouth water
A must for desert is the CREEM BERLAY (?)
Only one little problem is they serve it cold, make sure and ask to have it warmed up and you'll think your in heaven
The drinks were excellent, as was the service, and atmosphere
ENJOY!!
Good food and service
Very good-looking crowd
Excellent place to chill and ease into a weekend
great seafood restaurant in union square
went there for lunch and ordered the shellfish combo (oysters, clams, shrimp, lobster) and prix fix lunch, which is a good deal at $20
02
oysters were fantastic while the shrimp were tough (overcooked)
atlantic salmon was very succulent
service was friendly
what makes blue water grill standout is the decor, the upstairs level in particular with its booths and view of the main dining floor
great place to bring that special someone
We made reservations and they seated us promptly
We picked this place strictly from citysearch recommendation
Great advice
Food was fantastic
Wonderful sushi appetizers
Striped black bass cooked to perfection
Very crowded, don't go without reservations
Well worth the money
Convenient from subway
Once the waiter found out we just wanted dessert, he treated us like we had the plague
His attitude sort of ruined what I wanted to be a nice little time since it was my sister's birthday and she loves their chcolate cake
So, even though I have been there quite often, I am sorry to say that our family will not be going there again
We went to Blue Water Grill (what a place!) for my grandmother's 89th birthday
The crab cakes were ecsquisite! I had the shrimps pasta
I t was the best
Last time I had the chicken
It was good too
Gram's had the Sea Bass
It was as good as bacon
A really nice guy named Chris waited on us

How does this place stay in business
I never see anyone in there
I thought I was missing out, thought I would discover something new and exciting
NOPE! The restaurant is huge (for NYC standards)
We were the only people in there for 1 and a quarter hours
I did notice some people come in for carry out, maybe they do one heck of a take out delivery service
The food tasted a little boxed
For the price, I will continue to go to Mitali in the East Village
That can't be beat
Clearly not an Indian restaurant, this is actually a clever piece of Pakistani subterfuge created to besmirch the reputation of Indian food and thereby sabotage US-Indian relations
If allowed to continue, it might just work
My family and I have been going to India house for years
I don't live in Brooklyn any more but this is one of our favorite place to eat in Brooklyn, when we vist my family
The food is great, the portions are large
It is very affordable and casual place to eat
I have yet to find a place that makes as good indian food as they do
It's not your trendy Park Slope Place, but if you want good Indian food
You can't go wron
The food is fresh, hot and plentiful and so very delicious
And the prices are terrific
The waiters are friendly and caring
Enjoy!
Service could be improved, we never received water refills but other than that the food was authentic Mexican
My family and I (four Mexican Americans) ate in silence because the food was that great
I strongly recommend the beef flautas
Chimichangas and soft tacos were great too
To be honest, we were hesitant to try this place
From the view on the street, we thought it looked a little suspect
But we were so wrong! It's terrific
Authentic Mexican, not the Tex-Mex we feared
The staff is very polite and sweet, and the food is delicious, if a little on the spicey side for some
It's become one of our favorite places
A great deal
Great food and the best hummus I've had anywhere in New York
At last, fond memories of Israel and Bahrain can be quelled
Much better Middle Eastern food than at the overrated Olive Vine across the street
I've eaten at both quite a few times but am sticking with Laila from now on
The menu is extensive and interesting and the prices are reasonable
Our waitress was extremely friendly and working her butt off (apparently they were understaffed and much busier than expected)
The appetizer platter (we had the 2 person) has all your favorite mezes (hummus, baba gannouj, falafel, grape leaves, etc) and, being a bit of a connoisseur of these dishes I can say that overall, they were as good or better than average
The hummus and baba especially were delicious, as was the yogurt dish
Falafel was more in-your-face flavorful than I am used to
I got the Ouza entree which was decent dry, but add the cucumber yogurt which comes on the side with it and it was very tasty indeed
My friend got the spinach pie (sans cheese - a steal at $4) and we were both immediately hooked
The outdoor seating is a nice option in the good weather
In Short Large, classically-inspired murals of the Acropolis, Pegasus, etc
, enhance this neighborhood eatery's interior
Otherwise, with its dark wood paneling, vinyl booths, open grill and accented waitresses, this space looks akin to a standard diner-tavern without the sit-down counter or bar
Although the name implies Greek cuisine, the menu's homeland offerings are few: souvlaki, moussaka and gyros
Mostly, this small restaurant offers eggs, hot sandwiches and traditional American platters
At any time of the day or night, you can always end up at this really great diner
People are very friendly, food is good and you can easily find yourself coming again, and again, and again
Good quality neighborhood Greek diners used to be all over NYC, but many of them have been replaced by bistros and cofee bars
This is one of the better examples of the dying breed
Honest service, honest food in an no-frills classic atmosphere
Good diner food
Very nice
They once went out to buy strawberries at the local fruit store when my son ordered belgian waffles with strawberries! I've been getting a non-standard version of the shish kabob for years, always graciously served
A real neighborhood joint
Adequate diner standards, enhanced by long hours and occasional flashes of brilliance in the wee hours: be there when the apple turnovers come out of the oven
The tastiest chinese cuisine Brooklyn has to offer
No flash, all class
Affordable, petite, and sweet
First, the bad: the actual restaurant has zero ambiance
Now, the good: The staff is really friendly and nice, a rarity in nyc
The food is affordable and tastes great and fresh, so you don't have a deep, deep sense of regret! Recommended foods: egg rolls
Everything about our meal at Snooky's was terrible - the soup was cold and bland, the toast was burned, the waitress was clueless
One of the worst meals I've have had in a long time
Great neighborhood bar/restaurant
Catch a Yankee, Mets game, have a burger and great conversation with the bar keep
The 20 oz Steak with onions is incredible
Highly recommended
A nice and cozy place
My husband, who is beyond picky, enjoyed everything
It was nice to go out and not hear any complaints
You have no idea how rare that is!!!! Thank you Aunt Suzie
we'll be back
Thought this place was a real in Park Slope
The food and decor are well done in an old fashion and homey style
No pretensions, it's your Aunt! from Brooklyn!
Everything we have tried here was great, I love this place!!!! It can be very crowded so get there early the parking is not great
just awful but always crowded, must all be from Idaho
I had slamon wth freshly diced tomatoes in a cream sauce while my husband enjoyed a perfectly cooked steak
Every ingredient was on the plate to please
The food was as good as you could get elsewhere for twice the price and the service was professional and accomodating
What a find!
Since it was the first time there I was surprised to find this place has been around for over 20 years
I understand its lasting power
The food is good and solid and the portions large enough to take some home
I like that! The service was friendly and  competent and the prices reasonable
That's getting hard to find
Get there early to get a parking spot
Aunt Suzie does it right
The food, service and atmosphere are all great and you don't have to refinance to eat there
Bring it on Aunt Suzie, we're hungry!
Aunt Susies used to be on 69th Street and 15 ave when it first opened on the corner
The food was great, many years ago
Went recently on a recommedation from a friend as it moved to Smith street and the food was now good but not great
The red sauce was OK
I guess with the increase in clientele the quality appears to have slipped

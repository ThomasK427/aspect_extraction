Definitely a good steak, and the waiters know how to steer (no pun intended) in the right direction
Not for the health conscious, but a great choice for a no - nonsense cut of meat
I wouldn't say that it's my favorite New York Steakhouse, but it's up there
The steak is a bit salty, but definitely as tender as can be
Definitely a place for men
but it's a steakhouse, so who cares?
My wife and I dined at Frankie and Johnnies on a Friday evening
We were a few minutes early for our reservations, but they had no problem seating us
The atmosphere was extremely pleasing-- a small and intimate setting, not loud and crowded like some of the better known steakhouses in Manhattan
It seemed like a place where those in the know would go for a quiet dinner with good service and great food
A very 1920's feeling
The service was supurb-very professional without being stuffy, and the steaks were prepared to perfection
The appetizers and side dishes were very good
We enjoyed the lump crab cocktail, shrimp cocktail,filet mignon, creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes-all were excellent
The prices were what you would expect at a good steakhouse in any large city
Overall a very enjoyable experience
I would highly recommend this restaurant
My wife took me here before a show
I make great steak - This was better
As a history buff visiting New York - I loved this place! The food was excellent and the place was really neat
If you are looking for a good steak this is the place
If you are looking to see some NY and Broadway history - this is the place too
Frankie Johnnie's has great steaks, and the service was excellent
The environment was very fun to dine in, I'd definetly recommend it to my friends
Now I know
I could not believe the fabulous flavor of steak
I dont' know if it was the steaksauce or the dry aged but I know I will always visit my NEW FRIENDS whenever I am in NEW YORK CITY
This is the classic what you see isn't what you get kind of place
The rooms look like a throw-back to the 50s and 60s
Kind of darkand a little on the dingy side
Given the look of the place, you might get the impression that the food isn't going to be anything special
But, get over that and, you'll get some of the best steaks anywhere! They're done just the way you want them and the quality of the meat is outstanding! Order up some cottage fries and creamed spinach and you're well on the way to achieving cholesterol heights you never imagined
But, what a trip!!
I've never been a big steak eater but now I am
And the creamed spinach was amazing!
After many visits to FJ's I can say I have always had a great meal
The steaks are out of this world! I have had the lobster tails, and they are also excellent
The barkeeper is friendly and really knows how to make a drink!  One of my favorite places!!
This place was great
The steaks were aged and cooked to perfection
After having a bad experience at Plataforma the night before, this was a definite treat
Rates up there with Chicago and Houston Steak places
I have eaten at many steakhouses
I know a good steak when I get one
This is a one of a kind steak house
its not Sparks its not Peter Lugers
Its Frankie Johnnies
If you go here order the T-bone
ask for it Charded on the outside, you get a tasty lightly salted chard juiciest t-bone you ever had after the waiter cuts your steak its pure heaven then on
Atmosphere
Its not fancy shmancy
its down home good off the beaten track nyc steakhouse
you get a view of playpen
its what gives this place character
you may run into a Broadway crowd but if attended at the right time you will never be hassled by them
I have seen many famous people there
its a great place
I urge anyone to try the place
its a different steak experience
Reserved a table for 8 to celebrate my parent's 60th anniversary, were seated in the back room next to a coke machine!! Everyone was happy with their steaks and chops
The potato Pancakes were a disappointment, very little potato and in the shape of a ball! When you book a reservation, be sure to ask for the front room
We first happened across Frankie Johnnie's by accident
It was one of the best accidents I have ever come across
We visit New York at least once a year and we always make sure we dine at Frankie Johnnie's
It is very intimate, and so very comfortable
If you enjoy being crammed into a hot, claustrophobic, stale, ugly upstairs room and served by sweaty bores, then this is the restaurant for you
Also, if you don't have the appetite of a bear - you'll be charged 50% extra to share an entree or eat just an appetizer
And you don't even get your money's worth -- a side order of asparagus consists of 5 undercooked, dry stalks
You'd be better off going ANYWHERE else
This is nothing but a tourist trap
they must have changed their setup because it was nothing like i thought it would be
it got SMALL!!!  the pizza was good, however, if youre looking for a place to sit down, do NOT go here
they have a counter with 10 seats and three in the back next to the oven
VERYYY SMALL SPACE
The best and quickest slice of delicious pizza before the theater and after showtime! All theaters within walking distance
so happy i discovered this place in midtown
great food, prompt seating, attentive service, and all for a very reasonable price
looks a bit like a diner, but is a great, laid back type of venue of everyday eating
since discovering this location in march, I think I've eaten there at least 40 times
I was very disappointed in this deli
It's the only one I was able to try on a recent visit to NY
It was convenient so we went in to grab a sandwich
They weren't what I have heard of a great big NY deli sandwich and my bread was so stale it was hard
I would have complained but we took it to go
The food didn't look well refrigerated either
I would not recommend this place and will never go back
Thank goodness for the Times Square Deli
We were in sticker shock trying to locate some breakfast one morning and we turned a corner and lo and behold-the Times Square Deli
While not fancy, it serves good food at normal prices
We ate breakfast here every morning of our trip
Great service, fat service, good food, and very affordable!
This place is a good spot to get a quick bite to eat if you are in the area
Even if you want to just stop in to get a snack they got a decent selection
Don't worry about it if you aren't in the area because it is not that greta that you have to travel accross town
A great deli with a huge selection and an seating area upstairs
The sandwiches are as good as deli sandwiches get, the bagels are fresh, and the pizza is solid
The egg sandwiches are reliably very good
For lunch, try the white meat chicken salad
Friedly service, almost always with a smile
Brought a tour group of 35 for breakfast

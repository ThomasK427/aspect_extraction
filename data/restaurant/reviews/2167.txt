i ended up getting $70 omakase, which i did NOT think that was worth $70 for, however it came out with 5 appez and 1 main dish
Sushi was good, could have been fresher i thought
My girl friend got Shabu shabu, and she had fun with it
:) what i recommend is FUTOMAKI!!!
it was the best futomaki that i ever had
had eel, shrimp, mushroom, spinach, egg and japanese pickle
it was so delicious
so i suggest that if you want some good rolls, def go here
!!! (Plus cherry Sake was so goooood too!!!) even though we end up dropping $170!!!!!
Japanese dishes are normally dubtle in flavor
Their dishes are more for presentation rather then taste
But this place lacked in both
The sushi wasn't so fresh, the udon noodle soup was bland and the tempura, though flakey, was a let down once dipped in their nearly flavorless sauce
Sure the atmosphere was nice though I couldn't seem to find the sushi bar
The wait staff were all friendly and the service was unusually fast for a Japanese restaurant
Still not enough for me to return
Inagiku is unique in that there is no mediocre dishes; either really good or really terrible
For example, their sushi/sashimi is not up to par, but I love their foie gras sushi
I like their filet mignon and eel tempura is great
I was there for restaurant week, otherwise it's not an area of town I go to often
at least for food
I tend to stay downtown for a more casual scene
The food was good but the atmosphere felt too corporate
The design of the place was tacky and felt 80's
Some ideas that didn't translate well
I guess it's a good place to go for a business dinner, the eel was very good and the sushi was decent
I prefer Nobu for a more interesting menu and I think Sushi Yasuda has better sushi and more authentic atmosphere
Still I am glad I tried it and they were one of the better restaurants that offer restaurant week
The service and selection were good
to fine Japanese dining
In fact while sushi is pristine and beautifully presented, there is no suchi bar here
Rather there is - uncommonly in a Japanese restuarant - a great looking Western style bar, as in beverages
Food is stylish and senstaional adn restuarant is extraordinarily good looking
Service can be a little frenetic, but always well meaning and solicitous
Tatami rooms are best private room deal in town
I like Inagiku for the tempura, which is among the best in town
The sushi and sashimi are very good as well
Very luxurious for a Japanese restaurant
This place is nothing short of abyssmal
The food, while standard diner food, is mediocre at best
They make all of their money, however, on beverages
Don't order a big glass of juice, as they'll bring you the $7
50 glass that isn't even listed on the menu
Don't order water as they'll bring you a bottle of Poland Spring at $2
50
Breakfast for 3 was well over 50 dollars
The waitress was obnoxious and rude when we questioned the juice bill, and was clearly irritated when she found out we were from the area rather than tourists she could scam for even more money
I would not go back if they were giving away $100 bills in the food
Manchester has a great selections of beer on tap and in the bottle from all over the world
Good prices and the bar tenders are friendly
you'll get a free one on every 3rd beer
It's your typical pub with no frills
The food is actually pretty decent too for being bar food
The lousiana hot sandwich has some spice!  I do question some of the music selection
It's a wide range from probably the bartenders Ipods
Place is changing for the worst, as a long time local, I see changes I do not like--college types drinking bud? for a place with no bud for 20 years! bring back Caroline and her staff
Looking for a new down to earth local in the area
Awsome beer selection including my favorite Belgium brands like Hoearrden and Chimay
They have happy hour till 7 PM where they serve 20 oz premium beer for $3
50
I had endless Hoegarrden last nite
LOL they have 25 cents wing special on monday and these wings are huge and very good
and they have decent and affordable menu
the place is pretty small and service can be pretty slow sometimes but i don't mind at all
Excellent beer selection, fantastic pub food
The best shoestring fries (try with malt vinegar), amazing burgers and very tasty cheese steak hero
Very relaxing, not at all pretentious
The Scene The steakhouse, designed by architect David Rockwell, whose credits include Nobu, Vong and the Lincoln Center branch of Rosa Mexicano, is a sweeping 7,000-square-foot space on the northwest balcony of Grand Central Terminal
Rockwell's design is the traditionally "masculine" steakhouse model--polished mahogany and leather abound, while a large circular bar up front beckons martini and Manhattan drinkers
The Food The fare is typical, showcasing sundry cuts of grilled beef and broiled seafood
A giant porterhouse is available for two and arrives sizzling, tender and with an intensely beefy flavor
A New York strip steak benefits from skillful broiling that chars the exterior, sealing the juices and rendering the center lush and pink
Even filet mignon, which often lacks flavor and texture, is agreeably firm and well-seasoned
MJ's place is a waste of time and money
The hostess (with her over exposed cleavage and constant eye-rolling) was unpleasant and for the most part indifferent towards us
Although the menu is standard steakhouse fare, I was pleasantly surprised to find blue point oysters (a Long Island specialty) as the appetizer for the day
That is, until our server came and placed six absolutely rancid and ROTTING oysters on our table
They smelled like the sweepings from the floor of the primate exhibit at the Bronx Zoo
they were absolutely horrendous and I refused to have them at the table
Bill, the maitre'd was excellent and apologized profusely (even gave us a free $14
00 slab of cheesecake for compensation) but it certainly didn't make up for the rest of the meal
The New York strip was stringy and dry, the $12
00 cesar salad was TRULY AWFUL (I've seen better, fresher romaine lettuce at Wendy's) and the herb roasted mushrooms tasted of pure salt
One bonus, the crawfish chowder was very rich and tasty
Overall, the service was excellent (with the exception of the ditzy and unpleasant hostess) and the food was awful
Eat at your own risk
Where to begin?! We were sat promptly, but when our waitor came over he didn't even ask us what we'd like to drink
Then my husband asked if they had a wine by the glass list and the server snatched the Bottle list out of my husbands hands
When he took our order we just KNEW he was going to mess up
Sure enough! Our appetizer (garlic bread fondue) came out immediatly but as soon as we took one bite our meals came! How they cooked 2 steaks in 5 minutes is beyond me
Plus they were cold on top of that?! Turns out they gave my husband the wrong size and we realized once we got to the middle that we had each others meals, not our own
The waitor was snobby and the service was horrible
We felt completely uncomfortable and rushed
We will NEVER go back again
Thought I would check out MJordan's Steakhouse despite the number of poor reviews
If you are looking for unique ambiance
you will find it here amongst the thousands moving in and out of Grand Central
service was attentive until a party of 15 sat next to us and then it went downhill from there
food was served luke warm and was not worth raving
steak was decent and salmon was barely even cooked

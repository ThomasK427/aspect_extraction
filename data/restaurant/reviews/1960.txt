Mr
Tangs was a great find we had been walking all over looking for a good chinese food walked in Mr
Tangs and found it for sure , We orderd Lemon Chicken, Orange Beef, fried dumplings, and Chicken fried rice
Food was Very good prices were just right Staff was very friendly
If you love chinese food this is a great place to try
It was a Saturday afternoon so it was nice to be in a calm elegant restaurant after the shopping chaos in Chinatown
I was amazed by the fact that the crispy chicken my mom ate had little bones in it, but it looked delicious
A crispy golden exterior and pure white meat like you've never seen before
The bones were kind of annoying so I stuck to my own food
I had sweet and sour chicken and it was awesome!!! The dishes didn't come with rice so we had to order it seperate
Clean bathrooms! It was my third time in NYC but I go to Mr
Tangs everytime I visit
The sweet and sour chicken and the peacefullness of teh restaurant is worth it
I've been to Mr
Tang's a couple times, both times with a large group of friends
Usually, the wait is not long at all, but on busy nights, you could end up waiting up to 30 minutes for a table even with reservations
We tried all different types of dishes, from their sizzling beef dish, shrimp fried rice, roast chicken, peking duck, roast pigeon, fish, sauteed crab, steamed vegetables, and tofu dishes
Each dish was tasty, but none were extraordinarily delicious
If you're looking for a night out of Chinese food, it's a good place to go with a large group of friends
I recommend the Peking duck
I have been here twice - once with a large group and once with one other person
Mr
Tang is nicer than so many other chinese restaurants in Chinatown, but also more expensive than most
The food is great, but it is important to know what to order
Order chinese food - not chinese-american dishes like chicken with broccoli
Also, don't go here if you're vegetarian
In fact, don't go for chinese at all
Chinese cuisine is so centered on dead flesh that ordering vegetarian food in a chinese restaurant would be like ordering a hot dog at Nobu
The Scene Pho Viet Huong may not be fancy, but it's a wonderful value and the food is deeply satisfying
While the decor is a bit bland--a white room with a few fake palm trees and thatched roof--the service is fast and friendly
The Food Spring rolls are small, crispy and come with mint and lettuce for wrapping; summer rolls are light, with just enough crunch and green onion flavor, as well as the world's best peanut sauce
The noodle soups are enormous and tasty, especially the beef
Green papaya and beef salad will have you wanting to go back for more as soon as your meal is over
The perfect way to wash it all down is, of course, rich Vietnamese iced coffee
I normally don't expect exceptional service at places such as these as you would normally go for the food and value for money, but even this place disgusted both my boyfriend and I when we went there Saturday night
We were not served water, the servers took forever to take our order, pho took forever to come out (and in most places they come out even before the appetizers), we had to ask twice for our order and a 2nd pair of utensils when they took ours away (they ignored us the first time), and we again had to wait, for the bill to come
Food was ok, not great
Given the variety of food in the city and sheer number of GOOD pho places (like in Flushing), I am never coming back
Save your money, your time and your evening!
I have been to this resturant multiple times and it is a great easy way to enjoy great Vietnamese food
The interior is typical China town fair, but the food is oh so tasty that when you are there you don't really care what it looks like
I love the spicy chicken salad and the pho is really great on a cold night
It's hard to believe that the negative reviews on this page are concerning the same restaurant I know and love
Pho Viet Huong is absolutely one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in New York City, and is certainly a remarkable source of delicious food for minimal cost
Yes, the service will not win any awards, but frankly it is quite in line with the service in most of Asia, and for that matter, in most of Europe
The concept of fawning, insincere service is very much an American invention
The servers at Pho Viet Huong are efficient and pleasant and the management is extremely friendly
Yes, the decor is simple, but compared to many restaurants in the neighborhood it could win design awards
The bottom line is that the food is superb and the prices are quite reasonable
I eat here every chance I get
I am a fan of Cong Ly too! I mean Pho Viet Huong is at a good location, but face it, the broth is cloudy and oily -they're supposed to constantly dump the top layer off of the Pho broth, service is ran with attitude who cares about you, I have plenty of other customers to make money off of
Newspaper rated Cong Ly at top 10, this place is at number 30+
With that said, I recommend trying once (so you believe me) but don't come out thinking that this is what Pho supposed to taste like! And don't be surprised when the first thing they say to you is what do you want, with no eye contact
Not many reviews about restaurant of such quality, unless something was extremely good or extremely bad
The food there is mediocre (you can randomly pick Nha Trang, Pho Bang and get the same thing; if you are looking for a hole in the wall, Cong Ly), but the service is bad
I go there often enough to witness upset customs leaving in the middle of their meals
I said to myself, who cares, as long as I order, eat, pay and leave, what could possibly happen
Boy was I wrong
My luck ran out last week, it was my turn to get abused
SPEAK ENGLISH, was what he said when he couldn't hear my order over the background noise
Not only gave me the wrong dish, my friend asked for lemon, he finally brought it between his fingers and threw into the dish as he walked by
We left immediately
What a gem
This yummy, inexpensive Vietnamese ought to be at the top of any foodies' list
Take relatives there when in town, or go with your family
The decors is nothing special, but then, you are paying for the food - and it's a steal
Try the spicy lemon grass sauce on shrimp
Inexpensive, delicious
Bright lights, no ambience
Authentic Vietnamese (I've also been there)
Order the Beef Papaya Salad and Salt Pepper Squid on the specials sign on the wall, and you'll keep coming back too
This is a great place for the budget conscious and fans of no-frills food from the subcontinent
Don't let the stark decor and slightly surly service turn you away - this place is a total gem
As an appetizer, I recommend the lamb sausage or the naan bread
The naan is made on-demand, fresh from the brick oven
For the main, I usually have the three vegetable combo - it's an appealing $4
50, and is perfectly aromatic and quite filling
The chicken tandoori is good, too, but I'm always a tad suspicious of meat at these low, low prices
This place rules
Owner Shakeel Shak Diesel Kazmi slings daal like your momses does- that is, if she learned how to cook while kicking it in Karachi
The vegetables outplay the meats- nothing can stop the three-dish Vegetable Combo from putting up a triple-double
And at $4
50, the Combo will never create salary cap concerns
Don't forget to pick up some seductive ras malai before you leave
The House maintains a minimalist dcor, but who cares? Go for the food, not the environ
If you need ambience, go pay more for far lesser quality food at Baluchis
The Scene Wo Hop's fluorescent-and-linoleum grotto is pure time-machine New York
Droll blue-jacketed waiters dispense schtick and fortune cookies to tables of raucous eaters, while streams of New York's Finest line up for takeout
Be sure to check out the 8-by-10 glossies of unknown "celebrities" adorning the back wall
The Food Weary of duck feet and fermented tofu? Put down those chopsticks! Brandish your fork proudly as you plow through the unregenerate Cantonese-American classics that have been served here for years
Don't expect culinary magic, though: flavors harken back to the era when the two main varieties of Chinese restaurant food were Gummy and Fried
But if you give in to the pull of nostalgia, a good time can be had
Sauces are mucilaginously comforting; the fried stuff is actually tasty
Go ahead--order sweet-and-sour pork
We won't tell
This little place is the most amazing food Ive ever had
It should deffinatly have a 10
0 raiting and if you go i promise you that you will agree
One thing though go into the lower resturant the waiters are very friendly I swear you will have an amazing time, my friends and I will actually go in to the city just for the steamed dumplings at 1am
The food is just that good give it a shot im sure you will agree

Therefore, there's nothing to wash down the mediocre food with and make us forget we ever ate it
I pity the salmon and octopus that gave their lives to be on our plates
They must be rolling in their graves with Wally at this ripoff of a place
I love Wally's, I go every chance I get, and bring new friends because I consider this place my own discovery that few know about yet
I was appalled to see ANY bad reviews
I guess the corporate groups are starting to catch on, and that's a real shame
Iwas there recently and saw 2 large groups I think one of them was the one who left such a scathing review here
From where I was I saw one group having the time of their lives, and one complaining endlessly, even though they had the same menu and were given more food
I'm hoping that more cool people discover this retro jewel and keep out those obnoxious groups by filling the place with people who enjoy it
Let the groups go for the weekend brunch, we'll go Sun to Thurs 6-7:30pm for 2 for 1 drinks!!! Awesome!
I'm an american who reside in rio in Brazil and I was visiting family that decided to take us to waikiki wally's last week end
What a surprise to find a little paradise above the tropics Good food Good service Good drinks
I have found there what was missing in New York before I left
I went with a group and we all left the restaurant hungry
The prix fixe dinner provides inadequate food
We complained to the manager but he wasn't willing to do a thing to accommodate us
We had to go out to eat afterwards
Afterwards, I checked Citysearch and found three reviews complaining about the exact same thing!!! P
S
It's incredibly tacky, too
It's basically Lucky Cheng's food
not great
bad service and syrupy drinks
Pass on it
Went for my third time
First time, it was cute and fun (especially after some of the tiki drinks, but pricey, overcrowded, service slow, waited a long time for our table, and the food was just okay
Second time, service a little better, food better
Went back this past weekend, they have it together finally!!!! Super friendly maitre d', prices much cheaper, food amazing, service perfect and quick
Even tho Saturday night, not as crowded, so we were seated right away
Do not go here in winter! The food and service were great, but the heating was not working
A good place for a group
went last night for the first time and was a little disappointed
the fake leis and the decor were really cute (made me feel like is was in the bradys go to hawaii episode), and the two drinks i got at the bar were great: pina colada and hibiscus heaven ($8-9)
BUT the chlorine smell is way too overwhelming
i have no idea how ppl are supposed to eat in that first room with the overchlorinated fake waterfall (no one was eating there)
eat in the back room w/the birds: dim, cozy, and quaint
food overall was pretty good, but overpriced
fried calamari was too salty and the black rice they serve with the chicken is
nasty (think licorice barley), but the chicken itself and the sirloin dish (large portion) were good
crowd by the bar was a little cheesy (upper east side), but it got better as we were leaving
Loved it! Fun atmosphere, different food, teriffic service and great drinks
This place was something different and a nice change of pace
Great concept for an intimite theme restaurant
It's refreshing to have a fun atmoshere with good food and also good service
The decor is really good kitch!! The menu is interesting
Our choices were delicious
We look forward to trying more of your dishes
Will keep you in mind when planning a party
went with 2 of my friends : A swede and a german
They loved it, and want to open up a similar restaurant in europe
The decor is amazing, with a waterfall, live birds and a really cool tiki bar ! The food was great, and the drinks are served in tiki mugs, and, you get fire in their scorpion balls! This was a not tipical NYC restaurant!!! 3 thumbs up !
We came to Waikiki with a large group last week end and we were amaze on how they created a little oasis in the heart of the cold east village
Try it for the great food amazing cocktail
We will come back
What a wonderfull place is waikiki wally's espacially when it is freezing coold
Surprisinlgy the food was excellent the cocktail even better and the service was warm and very attentive
One of my favorite
I almost have no words to describe the horrifying meal we had at Waikiki Wally's
But I'll try
After being seated, we waited nearly half an hour for our waiter to even approach us
When we finally ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our appetizers to arrive (our waiter never even checked on our food, despite our asking twice about where our food might be)
They eventually blamed it on a computer glitch - also known as waiter not putting the order in
Once we got our appetizers, it was ANOTHER 40 minutes before we got our entrees, which weren't hot and which were soggy and tasteless
Save your money and avoid Waikiki Wally's at all costs!
I can't believe some of the negative reviews on here
I went to Wally's about a month ago with my sisters and friends and we had a blast and couldn't believe how good the food was
Two had chicken, I had the salmon, which was tasty and unique, and my boyfriend had steak which he raved about
The drinks were sweet, but good
Just like tropical drinks should be
The waiter was hysterical
They did get one of our orders wrong, but gave us a free scorpion bowl b/c of it
Don't listen to the negativity, an evening at Waikiki Wally's is nothing but fun
Ask to be seated in the darker room, not the main dining room if you want privacy
I had dinner at Waikiki Wally's last night with a group of 10 people - ranging in age from 8 to 76 - and everyone had a wonderful time
The food was delicious, the staff was attentive and we especially enjoyed Cheng - he'll seat you and give you a lei
and if you're really nice he'll show you his coconut bra
It was wonderful to escape the cold of New York in a tropical setting
They did an amazing job in decorating and the food is great too
Our drinks came out a little slow at the beginning and we had a some trouble securing a second round
otherwise a fun entertaining evening
I would definitely recommend it to friends
Overall, this place is pretty good
The bar seems to be the attraction with tons of (maybe too many?) tropical drinks
We all agreed the food is excellent
We also thought our server was very nice
The decor is out there
My friends and I really liked it and we would definitely go back, although maybe on a weeknight when it is less crowded!
I went to Wallys last Friday with a friend for dinner
The neighborhood is not the best
After 30 min of looking for a parking spot I finally found one on 3rd street right in front of the Hells' Angel's Gang Club
As you can imagine I did not park there
The restaurant is in the middle of the block and seems out of place
Once inside it is fine, the tiki bar is interesting and the staff were very friendly
For a theme type restaurant the food was good
They also have a karokee room in the back
Staff hands out lays and walk around in grass skirts with coconut shell tops
Overall a fun place but because of the location and parking problem I would not go back
A bunch of my friends went here the other night
It was a lot of fun
Drinks and decor were great but I have to say the food was TERRIFIC! I did not expect it to be so great! I would definitely go back to this place

The food is something addicting, so if you're not ready to order often, watch out, you might not wanna go
Yeah, it's THAT good
You WILL be going weekly
The bar is good looking and even better tasting, AND you can smoke on the patio
OH, the outdoor patio upstairs
forgot to mention that
Anyway, DO go; you can bring mom, grandma, hell, even your kids, they're allowed to draw on the table ! Cool, right? But you might wanna go alone on the days with live music though
Oh, and one more thing, they have cool take-home plastic containers !!  (,,,,,what's up Ashish??,,,,,)
This place is deceiving from the outside
Once you walk in, the one word that comes to mind is 'comfortable'
The servers are great and caring and the food is really, really good!! The juke box has a fun assortment
I live a few blocks from this place and can't stay away
The veggie dishes are wonderful and the owners are some of the nicest guys I've ever met
Every time I've gone they've been warm and helpful
Every single one of the many friends I've taken here has loved this place too
Last year I threw a surprise birthday party for my girlfriend at Bogota--they had just opened up--and the owners and staff were beyond cheerful and accommodating to our large group of people
Okay, so being from NJ myself, I have no idea if the dishes are completely authentic Latin food or what (to address the review below mine) but I don't really care because every meal and experience I've had at this restaurant has been awesome
It is really unbelievable how the owners can put that name to this restaurant
I am Colombian, from Bogota and trust me people this is not even close to a bad restaurant in my city
The service was so poor I couldn't believe it; anyway that wasnt the word part, we have to wait almost an hour to get insipid, small and really expensive plates, that werent even entrees
However, what it really made me feel very upset was the arepa I cant believe they dont even make it from scratch or at least buy a bigger ones
They were exactly the same as the ones I buy for me at the supermarket, which 1 pack of 5 arepas costs you $2
50 and here they charge you $5 dollars and they dont even put butter, incredible!!!! I really dont recommend this place as a Latin one, please dont believe all the Latin places are like this one
I was so happy when i walked into this place--great drinks and exciting menu
It literally took us about 30 min to be approached by any waiter, we had to tackle someone to get our drink order in every time and then there was about a 15 min delay till each drink arrove
they brought out each dish one at a time (by the time my husband got his food I was done)
it is too bad because the food, ambiance, and drinks were great but they need serious help on the service
Love the vibe at Bogota
Where else can you get fresh fruit mojitos caipirinhas
I tried their Brazilian Sangria and it was delish
My table ordered a pitcher of it
And the tapas are great
beef, chicken pork empanadas were tasty and enhanced by their sauces
Grilled Corn on a stick, Arepas
Patacon with meat was very filling
The service was very friendly too
Plus they have an outside patio that is so romantic
When we got to this place it was pretty empty, however, it took them more than 10 minutes to bring the menus to our table and another 15 to take our order
When they finally brought our food, 2 entrees were missing (we thought they would come a little later)
40 minutes later, the waitress finally looked at our table and we asked about our dishes
We discovered that she had never placed the order at the kitchen
Not only the service was terrible, I ordered a $9 shrimp ceviche, and it literally had 2 shrimp in it
Why don't they call it avocado and onion in lime juice, garnished with shrimp?
That's just unacceptable, escpecially for that price
At the end, the check was a lot more than we would have liked to pay in a place like this
What a dissapointment!
Whenever my family and friends come to visit from out of town, Bogota Latin Bistro is THE only restaurant of choice for me where I know I and my friends and family will walk out very happy
I've said it before and I'll say it again, the staff at Bogota rocks
It is apparent that the owners place high emphasis on the customer experience
I can vouch for it
I walked in last monday at just 2 minutes past closing time and the owner greeted me and my friend and was able to accomodate us although their kitchen had already closed
This is what I call great customer service
Not only was he gracious, he made sure that our food came out timely and perfect
Nor did we feel rushed
Bogota won me over long ago and I will continue to patronize this great addition to Park Slope
After having many people recommend this restaurant, we decided to try it
I was extremely disappointed by the service
After being seated, we waited half an hour for the waitress to ackowledge us
This was only after we asked someone walking by if we could get a waitress
What was unacceptable was that the restaurant was almost empty
We then waited a long time for our food and when it arrived, it was cold
After taking our order, the waitress never returned to ask us if we needed anything else and we had to ask the busboy for the check
Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant, especially being that Park Slope is filled with restaurants that have excellent food and service
The owver's at this restaurant were completely insincere and rude
My order was messed up in the kitchen, which is fine, happens all the time, but when the waiter asked the owner to stop by my table to apologize for the mix up, he refused
Then, when I found the owner, he was completely rude to me and refused to apologize for the mix up, telling me that I should enunciate better
I will never return to this restaurant again!
Prompt seating and service no matter how full the place is
Great service and wonderful food
Best empanadas ever reminiscent of Trinidadian pastels!! Highly recommended
I've been back to this restaurant several times and am always impressed by the new dishes that are added to the Specials menu
They recently added a dish called Tortilla Soup which knocked my socks off
The portions they serve are huge and the prices are very reasonable
It is a nice, comfortable and colorful place
I'm happy that this restaurant opened up in my neighborhood
During the weekends is busy but the waiting is less than 20 minutes, which is very good for NYC
The food was delicious and the service was wonderful! It is a very friendly and fun place
The decor is fun
Staff are friendly, but oh man, and this has happened on both visits there - SLOW service
They're just having a good time and not very driven to get you your drinks or your food
This happened one night when it was packed, and one night when it was only 1/3 full
And when I nudged the waiter for my drink 15 minutes after ordering it, I got a so what attitude
Aside from that the food is fine
It's even good
I do wish they'd spare a little more fish for their fish tacos
TEENY portions of fish on those
And with Miracle Grill in the same neighborhood serving twice as much fish on the tacos for a couple dollars more, at twice the speed, Bogota needs to do more to make me choose them over Miracle Grill
My husband and I went on a rainy Saturday night
There was a short wait, so we sat at the bar, which was very pleasant (although I wouldn't go just for the bar)
The food was really good for the most part
Don't order the corn tortilla with the avocado salad--it lacks real flavor
But The fish tacos were good, and the chicken tamale was great! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive
The atmosphere was a little noisy, but fun, and would be good for a large group or just a couple
The value for this place was great-- we had 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 1 chocolate cake (yummy!!) for just $55 (not including tip)
We will definitely be back!!
The prices are very good and the food is pretty darn good
I've gone twice already had Bandeja Paisa, the Trucha, and for dessert the obleas and I was more than satisfied
As opposed to other fufu Latino places, this one has a great down-to-earth atmosphere, good non-greasy food (which means the owners still care what the hell they put on the table), and goos service
My favorite hang out for Colombian food in Brooklyn
they steak is good too, my friend had it and she couldn't stop saying, this is REALLY good

I was recently introduced to this place by a friend, and I have to say that it is now one of my favorites
The food is just delicious--there are large portions and they are very reasonably priced
I recommend the Maryland crab cakes, fried calamari, and the roasted cornish hen, although last week I had the lobster with ravioli and baby spinach and truffle oil and it was also excellent
I love the decor
Warm, soft light, white brick, black ceiling fans and a 'Hudson' theme
The service is good--friendly hostess and attentive waitstaff
During busy hours, take a seat at the bar first--I've honestly had one of the best Cosmopolitans ever here
I would say that this is a restaurant to take a date, or business associates or friends
New York City is famous for the great food it serves, and the Hudson Place definately stands out as a leading role model for this claim
I heard about this bistro from a few friends of mine and by golly are the dishes to die for! The crab cakes are up to par with those of Maryland and the smoked salmon angel hair pasta is delicately basked on top of a bed of delicious dried tomatos
The prices are more than reasonable and the service is one of the best around
The waitress is most kind and gives a very comfortable and friendly vibe
The overall enviorment of the resturant gives a feeling of a 1920's New York scenary and gives a cozy sensation of sitting by the dock of the bay
I highly reccomend this resturant
I loved the style and decoration in the premises
Service was friendly and prompt
We recently held a 25-person birthday party/brunch at Hudson Place
The back room (private) looked beautiful and was arranged perfectly for the amount of people
The staff/service was so attentive and did a great job
The brunch menu designed for the party gave several options and the food was delicious
Everything went smoothly and I would strongly recommend this restaurant for group reservations
A+
This restaurant is great for large groups
I went with 5 of my girlfriends
We called 30 minutes before to make a reservation and they had the table ready soon after we arrived
The food was really good, although I don't recomment the salmon pasta dish
That's what I ordered and it was like smoked salmon heated up on pasta with sundried tomatoes, spinach and no kind of sauce
Not too tasty
Some of my friends got the lobster and ravioli, which was GREAT! The service was okay but we had to wait forever for our order to be served
Best burger in town: grilled, cooked to perfect order
Great fries
Easy to get into even on weekend, but service is borderline atrocious
Servers disappear for llllooooonnnggggg stretches
One of the best meals for the value! Ambiance is decent but nothing special but the food more than makes up for it
Kind of an older crowd
The steak I had at Hudson Place is the best steak I've ever had anywhere! I loved everything about this restaurant and plan to eat there every time I'm in NY
It's a nice cozy atmosphere
The food is above average, the prices are okay and the drinks are good
Some pretty good food despite the many cookie-cutter restaurants in this neighborhood
A fun place to sit and look around both inside the restaurant and on the street
I'm not Hudson Place's biggest fan
We were able to get a table right away on Friday night, but we only saw our server twice and he failed to give us the specials, we overheard him tell the table right next to us after we had ordered and were already into our salads
It took forever to get someone's attention for another drink and to collect the check
Went on a Saturday night and had no problems getting a table
The burgers were excellent and the rest of the menu looked good
Service was too slow for my taste
it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get another drink and another 15 to get the bill
Nice decor and not too noisy
The portions, quality and pricing makes this the pick of Murray Hill for food
Try the crab cakes and the seafood risotto! Delightful!
When you first walk into the restaurant, it doesnt really seem that you are in a Middle Eastern restaurant
The dcor is not the great and there is really nothing special about the whole restaurant
BUT if you go on a Friday or Saturday, the feeling is different: you will hear Middle Eastern music being played by a live singer
And just as you are enjoying the music, a belly dancer takes over the dance floor and graces everyone with her beauty, style, and belly dancing
If you get the urge to dance feel free to get up and dance in the small stage (ie
An area in the middle of the restaurant)
Over all, if you go on a Friday or a Saturday you will have a GREAT time (especially with a group of friends)
And O, the food is very good too
I had the most delicious and authentic Lebanese dishes, served by the nicest people
I'm going back for sure
I went to Byblos on a wednesday night with two of my girlfriends
The service is excellent, staff very attentive, and even after we ate, they didn't rush us out!! The food options were great, allowing you to sample different meats, all of which were generous portions
All of the food was tasty! You can't go wrong!
I went with a large group and was very pleasantly surprised by generous portions, wonderful variety for all tastes and the best tabouleh this side of the East River
6 kinds of lamb are succulent and imaginative (I don't even like lamb!) Try the babaganoush- it's made with smoked eggplant and is wonderful
I haven't had such wonderful Middle Eastern since my experience on kibbutz in Israel
I hear there is a belly dancer late nights
The food is very good and the chicken gyros are great
Best way to enjoy it is to have it delievered or pick it up
The lines are brutal most of the times
But I order from them all the time
The service was excellent
The waiter staff frequented our table to ask how things were and see if they could make our meal more enjoyable
Additionally, we were allowed to mix and match items from the menu and started with a seafood appetizer that had squid, conche, mussles, asparagas, mushrooms and salmon
The food was excellent (appetizer, soup, main course and desert)
The presentation was as good as any I've ever seen and the food had just the right amount of flavor
The dinner was a bit expensive for my blood (keep in mind we are from Chicago so there is a price difference)
If it were 20% cheaper it'd be the best meal I've had in a long time, but heck it was well worth it
We were told the broc rabe was a special of the day so when my date ordered it, it can as normal broc
In addition, the room we were in was so quiet you could hear a pin drop and the martini was made entirely wrong
This place on 34th is the pits
I visited on 2/25/04 with a party of 10 for my wife's birthday
We were put at a table in the back which was in a separate room away from everybody
We arrived at 5:30pm and I told the waiter we had a show to go to and wanted to be out of the restaurant by 7:30
The service was excellent and not rushed
Specials were good and price was reasonable
Food was above average
Round of after dinner drinks on the house
Definitely will go back
When you first pull up to the place it doesn't look like much but on the inside it is very elegant and nice
the service is amazing and the food is delicious
I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to just get out and try a new place
this is a top notch restaurant that is very inexpensive
Never judge a book by it's cover
We had a group of 6 people- the food was excellent and the service is unbelievable! The staff is extremely friendly and pampering
The prices are very reasonable and the portions are large
You should definitely try this place!
My favorite restaurant for meeting with family and friends
Caesar is a terrific host and hearing his list of dinner specials sometimes make my mouth water
I don't know of a friendlier classic restaurant in New York

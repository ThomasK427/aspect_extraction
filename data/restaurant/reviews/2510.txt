And, yes, their cheeze pizza is ADDICTIVE
More addictive than Krispy Kreme doughnuts
and, I guess, equally unhealthy
The cheeze, the crust, the grumpy men who make and heat the pizza for you
it's an experience
So, grab yourself a cold rootbeer and order a slice
There is a small, cozy place behind the counter, where you can eat your pies in peace
Sal Carmine have been around forever, before this address they were around the corner from the old Thalia movie theater on 95th and Broadway,  they are defintely worth the trip uptown,  the cheese has character, the tomato sauce good not too sweet and the crust like ovenbaked bread from Naples
go for it before these two brothers retire and bring with them the secrets of truly good  NYC pizza
They do it right here
Pizza, pizza and only pizza! Great for a slice or to pick up a pie, Sal and Carmine's is the best pizza on the Upper West Side
They do nothing else
so how can they get pizza wrong?
live in the neighborhood and go there 2-3 times a week
best pizza i've had in the city
worth the trip up if you've never tried it!
Sal and Carmine have been making pizza in the Upper West Side for 37 years
They were born and raised in a farm in Italy
They make the best crust in the city and they use the best ingredients for the toppings
They have no interest in yuppifying their pizza
And they don't deliver (delivered pizza = steamed pizza)
These guys are the best
No delivery, one pie at a time, and better pizza than you'll find any place
I guess it is an upper west-side secret
But this pizza is perfect and savory
The joint has a NYC gruff atmoshphere that is classic
The food is so good they won't even deliver, you're forced to come pick it up!
They dont deliver, but they never have
I have eaten this pizza since I was a toddler and have yet to find a better slice
You really have to trust it when the guy making the pizza is also one of the owners
The seating area is pretty nice for a pizza place, just be prepared to sweat if it is hot outside because there is no AC
But where else can you get a slice of pizza with fresh ingredients that you can taste? If you dont like this, you dont like pizza
Completely unassuming pizza joint that takes pride in serving quality pies
Beware: the slices here are absolutely addictive
Give me two cheeses and a cream soda, I'm in heaven
As I'm not a New Yorker, I'll make no attempt to claim that this place is among the best in the city but if it gets better than this I don't know if I could handle it!
Whoever gave this place a 10 either works at/owns the place, or is comparing it to other pizza places within a 1/2 block radius of the restaurant
Look, the pizza is good, and the food is fine for a quick eat-in or take out, so if that's what you're looking for, the Perfecto's will do
But it's not in the upper echelon of pizza joints
I give the pizza a 7
While the coffee at this neighborhoody coffee house is very tasty, the management/service is often rude
On more than one occasion I have been turned down upon ordering a plain bagel to go with my coffee, with the explanation by the management that the establishment is not a bagel shop
Fortunately there are numerous other coffee shops that have opened in the neighborhood where I can freely order a coffee and plain bagel without the attitude
doubt I will return again to Zanny's every again
Great place for brunch, lunch, coffee, reading the paper and people watching
Yummy food with fresh ingredients, servers/owners who remember your name, rotating art exhibits, movie nights -- who could ask for more?
I recently went in to speak to someone about having my wedding cake made by this bakery
I was never treated so rudely
I was spoken to like I was a child and they made it so diffecult to do business with them I just left
It's just cake why make it so hard? I will take my business elsewhere
To someone who appreciates it
There are other places in the city, Billy's Bakery is one they know how to treat a customer
With all the new bakeries popping up trying to battle the Magnolia cupcake, my co-workers were weary when I promised them the best cupcake in NYC
But the cupcakes from Make My Cake were a huge hit
They even impressed the cupcake snobs
It's well worth the trip uptown
I have purchase two birthday cakes from Make My Cake
They have been worth every penny- quite delicious and very well decorated
The best cake I've ever had and highly complimented by party guests! Their red velvet cake is also incredible!
These are by far the best cupcakes in town- they are perfectly balanced- not too sweet, not too buttery, not too dense
just right
The strawberry, coconut and chocolate are the best
Don't miss this spot, just north of the park
The Scene The buttery-yellow walls, high ceiling with its warm wood-toned panels and sparkling lighting set off African-American artwork around the room
Word-of-mouth buzz keeps Amy Ruth's consistently crowded
On weekends, the after-church crowd is here; during the week, people are in and out from breakfast through dinner
The Food Chicken and waffles, smothered chicken, baked Virginia ham, salmon cakes, chicken livers, fried fish, pancakes--it's all inexpensive, freshly prepared and fabulous
Amy Ruth's is the kind of homey, unpretentious place you'll want to come back to--soon
I went to Amy Smiths last friday 7/28/06 and it was a very good friday
I had The Percy Sutton and my friend had the Pork Chops w/potato salad and collard greens
Everything on my plate and his was excellent
The cornbread I didn't care for; I've tasted better cornbread
The menu's needed updating and so do the table's they are very wobbly
The service was ok and I will be going to B
Smith's to see what this restaurant is about; check back for my reviews
Oh one more thing this is a family place; I give the decor a 12, not a place for a first date
I love the food at Amy Ruth's
Whenever we would have friends visiting us in New Jersey, we would take them there
The food and service was fabulous
Also, loved when local artists' would have their work on display
Got great art pieces through this venue
We have since moved to the South, but have not found a soul food restaurant that compares
Planning a trip to NY just to get some good soul food!
If you really want quality soul food bypass the tourist trap Sylvia's and walk yourself right down to Amy Ruth's
Trust me you'll feel better that you made the walk for two reasons:  1) to premptively burn off some of the calories you'll ingest at Amy Ruth's 2) the fact that you didn't waste calories eating the drek they serve at Sylvia's
If you want to eat at Sylvia's got to the one in Atlanta, it may not be the original but the food is far superior
If you want to eat good soul food in a bright and inviting resturant with quality service from a well dressed and friendly staff, take yourself right down to Amy Ruth's
The artwork on the window pane sets the tone for a relaxed and pleasent meal of comfort food
While you decide between the chicken and waffles (a Detroit invention, not Southern, don't tell anyone), ribs or fried catfish; have a glass of peach tea and enjoy the photos of the owner and various celebrities who visited the little restaurant on 116th St
Make sure you leave room for red velvet cake for desert and don't overstuff yourself on their delicious (yankee style) cornbread before the meal
It's just as good as Justin's but much cheaper
Watch out it's small and can get crowed quick, so be prepared to venture to the soul food restaurant across the street
I don't recall the name but the food is just as good, or head down to Amy Ruth's on 110th St
I grew up on soul food and this restaurant tops the charts! I had the bbq spare ribs dinner with yams and collard greens
Each table comes with fresh home-made (very important) cornbread to begin the meal
The ribs are seasoned to perfection with a sweet/spicy dry rub that will have you licking your fingers! The yams seemed to have vanilla as an ingrediant that was very pleasing to the palate
The collard greens, which can be hit or miss at many places, we delicious here! As someone that cooks and enjoys soul food, I give Amy Ruth's my highest recommendation!
it was well worth the subway ride uptown
the food was good and prompt
the lemonade was sweet and lemony

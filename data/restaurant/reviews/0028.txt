They have great appetizers as well
Expect to be cramped and you may have to wait a little for your food, but the service is really friendly and helpful
The decor is cute and cozy and they also have chill music playing
Plus, it isn't super expensive
We love it!
After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info
Friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service
Good wine selection as well as tap beers at happy hour prices until 7pm
i will definitely go back!! Sports on flat screen tv above bar kept me entertained through 3 rounds
Very good value
All I can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you'll find in the city, though the quality is some of the best
I didn't take a look at the rest menu, but the oysters were fantastic
There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8! You won't find that anywhere in Manhattan
The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon
$2 pints and tasty oysters is a great way to go
you won't be dissapointed
Look, there is nowhere in the city that you will get a better deal on raw bar items
$8 for 6 meaty blue points and a beer? That same deal will cost you at least $15 anywhere else
The word has gotten out and on weekends the place is crowded, but its still worthwhile
The raw bar is in general better than cooked dishes, but there are some stars on the cooked menu (fish and chips and lobster roll to name two)
I'd prefer you didn't come, so I could keep my seat at the bar
but I feel I must tout the qualities of Fish
Great, fun W
Village restaurant
went there last weekend and had a great time!!! the wait staff and bartenders are awesome
definitely check it out!
FISH is a very nice change from the usual seafood/oyster places in the city
The atmosphere is very down to earth
Sneaker and jeans are welcomed here
Their raw oysters are smaller than other places I have been in the city, but it is still a bargin
They have a sampler platter with 18 raw oysters for like 15
95!!! The restaurant's waitresses and waiters are extremely friendly
They are even kind enough to go over which oysters are what if you ask
The restaurant also has other entrees that are good as well
Calms in white wine sauce, seafood paella and many more
The food at this place was fabulous but not exactly cheap eats
Main courses don't come with sides and those are $4 each
I guess cheap eats was in reference to the raw bar based on other people's reviews but my bf and I didn't have that
We had the twin tar tar appetizer (tuna and salmon) which was good and flavorful, yellow fin tuna, seared to perfection, and Chilean Sea Bass, the juiciest I've ever tasted
I also ordered creamed spinach and whipped potatoes on the side
Mouthwatering! Everything was so good, I cleaned my plate even though I was ready to bust a gut
The only con about this place was that the corner table at the back had a funky smell
Not enough to make me change tables but funky all the same
I definately want to go back to try some of the other dishes
I was told by two different people in the same week to check this place out
Very unassuming
The service was excellent, and the food was great
Came looking for this place because I heard good things
Went inside and I started to get excited
The menu looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside
Whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were
Finally got our food after waiting a long time for oysters, doesn't take that long to shuck 'em, the place isn't that big, and it was OK
Looked good, lacked in seasoning, maybe that's why they leave the Old Bay on the Table, to season everything yourself
Great idea and base for restaurant, but work on the details, people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like
The oyster and wine special can not be beat! 8 oysters and a glass of wine for only $8!!! We picked on a bunch of different appetizers as dinner and everything was yummy
The portions are a bit small
especially the tuna/salmon tar-tar but yummy just the same
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great! Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!! You can't go wrong here
my boyfriend and i had a hankering for raw bar, but didn't want anything too chic or expensive
low and behold, citysearch came thru for us again! fish was GREAT
totally chill and unpretentious and an awesome value! the waitstaff was totally nice
and they have this great deal: 6 oysters on the half shell and your choice of beer, or wine for only $7! totally awesome! everything hit the spot
oh! and they have the best crabcake i've had outside of maryland! all meat and no fillers!  the only downside was i think they serve margarine with their bread basket instead of butter
otherwise, everything was perfect and i'll totally be back! thanks!
My husband and I sat at the bar at Fish last night
The food was very fresh and the service was attentive
We thoroughly enjoyed our Fish experience and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a night out in a relaxing, enjoyable atmosphere
I've been going to Fish for almost a year now
Recently the menu changed somewhat, and I'm happier now with this place than I ever have been
The oysters and clams are incredible
as fresh as I've had in the city
Calamari, crab cakes, tuna sashimi, STEAMERS
delicious
As for entrees - red snapper, any grilled fish, lobster roll
try them all
Also, the prices are VERY reasonable, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the place is always fun and inviting
If you havent been
check it out
You'll be glad you did
Great Raw Bar! This is a great place to meet for appetizers and drinks after work
I went last night with a girlfriend
We enjoyed the Raw Bar Special which was choice of 6 raw oysters or clams and a drink (house wine: red or white, or a beer) for only $8
We ordered another round of oysters because they were so fresh and the manager offered us some fresh horseradish
It was great! I have to saw that I wasn't impressed with the lobster roll or the New England clam chowder
They were mediocre
as I said
go for the Starter menu
If you are looking for a comfortable, friendly, neighborhood seafood bar/restaurant bursting with liveliness and fun, visit Fish
The seafood is fresh, prices are reasonable, and the staff are friendly
If you can't get a table, sit and eat at the bar and have a conversation with one of the most accommodating and friendly bartenders in the city all while watching the best oyster shucker in all of New York City
I had the lobster bisque and it was heaven
We had a lot of great service from Bertha
She was great
I started with the house special
1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell and a glass of champagne
Well worth the $8
We had an array of appetizers and entrees and were even served a free sundae for desert
The people were friendly and by all means, try one of the Saki martinis
Well worth it in any flavor
It was a crowded Wednesday night but we were seated near the kitchen right away, talked to all of the staff who were friendly and made the evening special for my date and I

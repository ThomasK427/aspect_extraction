The fish is fresh, and you can't the BYOB
Grab a sixer of Sapporo and go
Recently discovered this amazing find and have been back 3 times this month
Love the concept of BYOB and sushi! The table next to us brought bottles of greygoose and mixers
throw in some incredible and fresh sushi and it's a night to remember
The volcano roll grilled calamari are my favorites but you can't go wrong w/ the speciality rolls
The sushi brothers are hilarious - bring them sake and you'll be their best friend
The staff are courteous, never rush you and the bill is reasonable since you can fill up on your own liquor
Oh and yes, it's a bit of a scene on the weekends
it's crowded so you need a reservation since it's a tiny spot
My pals and I have a wonderful dinner experience at cube last weekend
The atmosphere was great, nice vibe
The volcano roll was my favorite and the serve staffs were very friendly and informative
I recommend this place to everyone
Was excited to try a new japanese resteraunt in my local vicinity
Highly recommended by city search I brought my appetite and my wallet
by the end of the meal both were empty
The portions were not just small they were miniscule , the worst I've ever seen
Seriously!
Cube is a great place for sushi because it's oh so yummy and not so expensive! It's also BYOB, which I enjoy
Having been spoiled by some of the best sushi around (Blowfish Sushi in San Francisco) several restaurants disappointed us until this place
The waitstaff is always very friendly and accomodating
The ambiance is pretty nice (but it's small, and can get very loud on weekends)
It attracts a younger crowd - dare I say on the preppy side
And for all the guys: last time we went it was all girls (i'm assuming single) so you might want to get in on the action
Cube has to be one of my favorite sushi places in NYC and I've been around
I go there atleast once a week if not more
You are also getting the best bang for your buck here in the NYC sushi scene
I have never been disapointed and have been there since it has opened
Cudos to the sushi chefs and the mastermind behind this operation
Now when I go somewhere else I think to myself We should have gone to Cube
The Dynamite apetizer is amazing, and I love the Clinton roll!
i can't stay away from this fantastic place! intimate and cozy, yet totally fun atmosphere
staff is awesome, waitresses are so cute, and suzanne (owner) is the sweetest thing alive
i've been to MANY similarly priced (and more expensive) japanese restaurants and this one is my favorite by far
make sure to try the otoro (tuna belly) sashimi, tuna nuta appetizer, and bahama mama and 63 rolls -- not to mention everything else on the menu
you will not be disappointed! added bonus: you can bring in your own bottle of wine
You have the best personalities behind any sushi bar
Ken and Ben: Great chefs, enthusiastic, and they love sake! The seafood is fresh
I love any seafood restaurant that closes it's doors on Mondays (seafood is usually delivered on Thursdays to NYC for the wknds)
Dynamite roll is great
Perfect white tuna! Bring a big bottle of COLD sake in, along w a few Saporos (It's BYOB)
I had one of the best times I have ever had at a restaurant
My friends and I had a great time, the food was excellent, and the service was better than I have ever received at a restaurant
Plus I didn't even enjoy sushi until I ate here
I started out with the salmon teriyaki but before you know it I was eating octopus and the volcano
Let me say it is a great place for both friends and family
If you're looking for a quality semi-fusion/trendy sushi scene that's easy on your wallet, this is the place
Although I prefer traditional/authentic sushi places, I love coming here
The fish is fresh and the prepared plates are excellent
This is a good place to take sushi naive folks because they have some really good rolls and cooked food too
And I love that it's BYOB
I can get a really nice bottle of sake for $35 that would easily run minimum $80 at a restaurant
The staff is warm and friendly (maybe because I share my sake with them)
Ken, Ben, and Suzanne, Kanpai!
Cube 63 is one of the few restaurants in New York where the sushi rivals that of the finest Hawaiian sushi houses with a value that exceeds expectations
The talented chefs offer traditional sashimi and sushi dishes to daring and delicious contemporary combinations
My favorites are the Wasabi Shumai, traditional tuna belly sashimi, Spicy Tuna Roll (gotta love their special sauce) and the Tuna Tataki
The American inspired Philly Roll is also a winner, as are many of their combos
As for service, you get New York professionalism without the attitude and the diverse crowd keeps the experience exciting
The sushi here was excellent
However, I expected a hip crowd considering its distance from anything normal and cool LES spot
Instead what I found was a restaurant literally filled with out-of-town (i
e
BT) college kids
If you're into polo shirts with the collars up, prada bags with abercrombie tops, and diesel jeans than this is the place to get sushi
Otherwise, don't bother trekking all the way here
This cute restaurant will surely spark your tastebuds and heighten your senses
The dimly lit room proves romantic and the food is fitting for a discerning food fanatic
The soft shell crab appetizer was light and crispy and the sushi just melted in my mouth like butter
It may be hard to get a table, as there are only less than a dozen total, so make a reservation and the pampering waitstaff will take care of the rest!!
Headed to Cube 63 a few weeks back (right after it opened): cute, funky little space, and such fresh and wonderful food, I was kvelling! Only drawback --- it was BYOB when I went, and I didn't *know* beforehand so I had to bust my rump down to Essex and Delancey for a bottle of bubbly
But it was worth it -- complemented the excellent food nicely
Imaginative chefs!
Never before have I had such inventive sushi rolls! Cube63's chef, Ken Lau and brother Ben Lau, are amazing!! They combine delicate flavors with spicy twists, spicy flavors with delicate twists!! Volcano Roll and Bahama Mama Roll are must haves
Also, the grilled squid appetizer is out of this world
The space is adorable: sleek and modern, but very comfortable
Owner Suzanne Lai is a dear and makes everyone feel absolutely at home
It is BYO, which is great!! Bring a bottle of Sake from the liquor store on Delancey and Essex or grab a sapporo from the deli across the street
Go to Cube before it gets too publicized
this little niche is the next hot spot for sure
In Short The initials stand for Hell's Kitchen
An industrial-styled coffee shop, lounge and bar, it offers something for everyone at every hour
Customers can order a lavish breakfast or brunch in the morning, nurse coffee drinks and bagels during the afternoon, enjoy a French-American dinner or stop in late for cocktails and a savory snack
Living nearby, we try to frequent all restaurants in Hells Kitchen
After three failed attempts, we quit HK
First of all, we admire them trying to pep up this area
But get real
Every visit same story
Fairly aweful service
Super-expensie drinks!! (I was charged $9
00 for a single shot of cheap well vodka, so that I could pour it into the sweet, weak martini drink
) And the food is mediocre and also pretty expensive
Unless it is happy hour, FORGET IT
This is such a delicious cool spot to eat
Great service without the attitude
And it's in a convenient part of town, especially to those coming from Hoboken through Port Authority!
I really enjoy this place, the food is really great and the interior is very pleasant to look at
The service is a bit slow
the waitresses tend to leave you alone and is a bit hard to flag down

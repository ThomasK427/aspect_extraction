Our server was attentive and very knowledgeable, she helped us choose from the great selection of wines
The decor is simple yet interesting with great attention to detail
This home cooking down to earth spot is sure to be a success
We came for a birthday and shared just about everything on the menu
It was all excellent, creative and well-prepared
The service was good under the circumstances, but too understaffed to be totally attentive
Also quite a loud place
Stopped in for drinks yesterday based on a friend's recommendation
Aksew has some super tasty cocktails
One of my favorites is made with pear, rye, and lemon
The food was equally fabulous and very creative
Great job!
This new restaurant is a real gem
The staff pays extreme attention to every detail and the complexity of the dishes makes them not only impressive but highly enjoyable
I was there last week and sampled a number of creations, all of which were delicious!
This spot rocks, i;ve been here 4 to 5 times and every time it gets better and better
you can tell chris has done his time with the big boys in new york, it show not only with the food but the presentation is fresh
i just hope he doesn't stop ( give this chef a raise)
Went a few weekends ago with one of my girlfriends and had a great time
Though the menu is small, it seems like there is something for everyone
You just have to be open minded
Our waitress was really nice as well and they had some yummy, yet expensive drinks!
Went there last weekend with my girlfriend and had ceviche with pickled jalapeno and a wicked good eggplant dish with serrano ham and brioche
Very creative and extremely tasty!
I RARELY give 10s when reviewing venues, but this place has earned it
I've eaten there three times over the past six months, and each has been equally equisite
Not only is the food incredible, but you get a lot for the money
Also, if you're into design, Karim Rashid did this place, so you should put it high on your list of fun places to check out
Highly, highly recommended
This place is fun! The chef prepares a very interesting menu that really works! Case in point: crawfish hushpuppies, baked fontina cheese with bosc pear, leek fondue, and truffle honey
A fun atmosphere and reasonably priced too
My girlfriend loved the place
Now it's a must-go place whenever she visits town
The place is tucked away, but the neighborhood is easy to get to by subway or cab (or walking if you live in the West Village or SoHo)
My favorite things about Askew are the food and the fun ambience
I've been to askew a couple of times, but they just changed the menu a bit (i think they changed the prices, not sure) and it has really turned into a gem
the food is amazing (the gnocchi on pesto sauce is to die for, hanger steak also), but it's a really fun place, and you feel like you get out of their for a steal
i was stuffed for $21
my girlfriend really liked the apple streudel, and she loved the ipanema drink
we weren't huge fans of the chickpea crepe
it's kind of tucked away on la guardia, but worth the find
I thought Askew was a tapas place in the traditional Spanish sense but it turned out to be a wonderful and fun restaurant that serves new American style food in small plates
We (4 of us) tasted 12 plates with 2 bottles of wine
The food was amazing in terms of flavor and presentation
Some of my favorites were the fotina cheese (it was salty and sweet with crunchy and gooey texture), the cerviche (the flavor was clean and it just bursts in your mouth), the bacon wrapped scallops (this is a classic but I just love the combination and the scallop was cooked to the perfect temperature)
But every dish we tried had its own charm
Although the pricing is on the more expensive side, this is a must try restaurant for its food
boy, what a disapointment: way too expensive and service with an attitude
No woder the place was empty
The tapas style of dishes were a lot of fun for our group of 4
We ended up ordering about 9 dishes and were treated to some delectable treats
The bacon wrapped scallops were delicious as well as the gnocchi
I wasnt looking forward to the beet salad but it was surprisingly good
I havent seen this level of quality in a small dish format
The only complaint at our table was the lack of a chocolate desert option which I hope they will fix soon
I promise you won't be disappointed ! Great vibe, fun and hip interior design and a great mix of music to add to the ambience
The staff is friendly, and attentive, but the best part was definitely the food it was delicious and inventive! (all small tapas, so order about 5 per couple)
Definitely try the gnocchi the baked fontina with pears and scallions, a creamy melted cheese dish that comes with crusty bread, ooohh heaven ! The waitress even gave us a complimentary dessert- warm chocolate lava cake with a scoop of cinnamon ice cream, what a perfect end to a perfect dinner! The drinks are quite strong, so I recommend having one of their wines by the glass to accompany dinner instead of a cocktail
All in all a perfect experience I will definitely be back as I am sure it will only get better !
We had heard that Karim Rashid had designed the interior of Askew
Being big fans, we decided to check out the place
The interior is beautiful and fun as we expected
And the food? Everything was delicious! Spicy dishes are actually spicy, plenty of interesting vegetarian dishes were available, and the carnivores had some toothsome dishes to dig into
The cocktails here are inventive and very tasty as well
Only one thing: Askew is a little hard to find since its exterior is so dark, so it's easy to miss
This may work in its favor once everybody knows about it, but we almost walked by it the first time
Fantastic selection of small plates! My favorite was the gnocchi - one of the best I have ever eaten
The DJ was really good and the ambience was really mellow, trendy and fun
Server was really attentive
I will definitely go back
Askew is top of my list in cozy restaurants with a character in 5 continents
Take it from this world traveler
The food is delecious and the concept of small plates is just brilliant
Let's you try so many different items w/o filling up too much on one dish
On a recent outing to the place with my friends, some of whom are vegeterians, I think we ordered one of everything and were NOT disappointed in any item
Not to forget the cool drinks
I would recommend this to everyone
Take your friends and have a BLAST
one of the few places i've tried that gets the mix right between really high quality food, as well as being a cool place to hang out and have some cocktails
tried this new place for the first time last week when they had a solid DJ playing -- a fun scene
This place was great! The staff was friendly and made perfect suggestions
Our drinks were always full and it seemed like the food kept coming
It's a perfect way to start your night and don't want a big meal
And it was packed
if you're looking for a new, fun place to have a few cocktails with some friends in the soho / greenwich village area, you should definitely try this place out
a lot of mixed drinks you won't find anywhere else, and a really creative tapas menu if you'd like something to go with your beverage
make a reservation if you're going on friday or sat, it was crowded when i went
I've been to Askew two times since it opened
Each time I found the cusine highly stimulating and delicious! Creative ingredients, beautiful platings, and some interesting drinks
Chef Chris Lim is truly a master
Very friendly staff
The menu isn't excessively long, so the quality of what's presented is extremely high
A great place to go if you're a foodie! Oh yeah, stay late for the DJ for some extra fun!
This place is a guaranteed great time! I threw my friend's birthday party there on a saturday night
Great place for groups
Since the dishes are small plates and very shareable, you don't have to order everything at once
Instead, you can keep ordering as your friends join you
The decor is super cool and the food was surprisingly good
You gotta try the gnocci and the ceviche
Ladies, definitely go for the cocktail called American Flyer

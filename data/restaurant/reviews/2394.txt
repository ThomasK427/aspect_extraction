Romans must be boarding planes now to get them
The liver and onions were positively succulent
They were even great heated up in the microwave today
The pear ravioli practically produced a scene from When Harry met Sally
We've been to Italy 11 times, and We actually just go there to eat- maybe we can just go to Felidia for the summer
6/22/02
My boyfriend surprised me last night by taking me to Felidia for my birthday
I was hesitant having recently read the negative reviews
I was blown away by: the fact that Lidia checked my coat!; the staff was sooooo friendly and knowledgable; the food was amazing; and it was an unforgettable night
Go with the waiters recommendations when possible - the calamari app was the best seafood dish I've ever had; the homemade pasta with pairs and pecorino also amazing! The wine list was very overwhelming but the sommelier was very helpful
The service seemed friendly at first, but then it went downhill shortly after we were seated
We waited about 20 mins until we could get a drink and for them to bring us menu's
The waiter never once came back to our table to ask how our meal was OR if we needed another drink
We also never had our water glasses refilled
The waiter served our dessert with some of the dinner plates still on the table
and when it was time to pay the bill, we waited another 1/2 hour before we finally had to ask for it
Our waiter ignored us and it truly was a horrible experience, a first experience like that that I have ever had in a New York city restaurant
The restaurant wasn't even busy the night we had dinner there
so there was no excuse for them to act the way that they did
This place was right around the corner from where I was staying during a recent visit to NYC
The food was good, reasonably priced, and the service great
I ordered the lobster pasta with a spicy tomato sauce and a salad and wasn't able to finish all of the pasta but that certainly wasn't because of the taste! For NY standards this place seemed pretty casual and not too pretentious
I'd go back the next time I visit
PAPER MOON WITH IT'S WARM DECOR AMBIANCE IS A GREAT PLACE TO EAT
FREIENDLY STAFF GOOD FOOD MAKE IT A FAVORITE PLACE OF MINE
The food is great and the service is great but the bar is too crowded with finance types talking about their wallets! Sit down at a table if you want a better expirence
They are so delicious
Oh, man
They really are
The mashed potatoes are very good, the onion straws and french fries were taste-making-delisciouses
But the real attraction is the mini cheeseburgers
Get them medium rare, the beef is of sufficient quality
Their flavor is unsurpassable
I've tried, believe me
But this place has replaced even Corner Bistro in the best cheeseburger realm for me
Try to get the older waitress if she can
She's one of those lifers that really knows what's up
This place has delicious burgers! The fries and onion rings are great, too! The restaurant itself has a lot of charm since it's in a landmarked building
I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great burger and a nice, casual atmosphere!
I loved the cheeseburgers here
We go for Sunday lunch and we've never had to wait for a table
When it's crowded, it can get noisy
My family has been coming here for years and years
it was my grandfather's local bar, and we make a point to get to Clarke's as often as possible
Although I miss the paper plates and the write your own order slips, the cheeseburger cannot be beat, the bar is busy and convivial, the bartenders friendly and cheerful
The oysters Rockefeller is fantastic and again, those BURGERS!!! Yum!!
Great burgers and beer
Classic bar/restaurant atmosphere
Small, crowed and noisy, just the way it should be!
This is an older type place that is able to differentiate itself a bit from some of the younger type bar/restaurants in the area
There is a front bar with a back room which is a restaurant
The staff overall is friendly, however the wait for a table can be very long
We were told 20-30 minutes, which wound up being over an hour
Usually, the bar area is pretty crowded
They have a jukebox, which focuses more on 60's and 70's music
The food is pretty good although the menu is a bit limited and somewhat expensive
Beer prices are reasonable, $4
50 for a bottle of Coors Light
Sure, it is pricey (a meal for 2 will set you back at least $60), and portions are small-ish
However, this is hands down the best burger you can find in Manhattan
The interior is dark and cozy, service is great, and the ambiance is perfect (think a juke box full of Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Bobby Darin, etc
)
The food is delicious (especially the bacon cheeseburger!) and the service and atmosphere couldn't be better
Great place to go after work or late night
For those of you who do not know this place- simmer down those of you who do- The burgers are good, the beer is better
The ambiance is what you're buying
Men, check out the old-school urinals
Worth a stop in just for those relics! Prost!
Hamburgers will melt in your mouth
You might sit next to a movie star (I actually did!) or 40 somethings discussing finance
All types of people come here
No need to dress up
The scene is casual and homey
The service is so friendly, they might actually sit down with you if the place isn't too busy
PJ Clarkes is a great neighborhood pub with fast bar service and very good food for the price
The bartenders are friendly and take care of you
The atmosphere is combination of corporate and old world
A great place to spend a weekday happy hour
I hadn't been in P
J
's for 10 years, my co-worker told me it was bought by new ownership
I figured I'd give it a try
( I always liked the burger but the service stunk
) The burger is great, better than Corner Bistro Melon's combined
The best part was the Raw Bar, which I don't remember being there in the old days
The service is really friendly, the new owners let their waiters have a wiseguy New York attitude
But in a good way!!!! Not in that snotty Soho waiter way
For food, this place rates as just good enough for east siders who know little or care to know little about food
The chicken pot pie was barely warm and the crust was soggy, prices are really too high for what is offered
Check it out for the old world atmosphere but don't be surprised to to see (and hear) grandmas with cranky whiny voices shouting over the din
The hamburgers are delicious and reminded me of homemade (maybe that is why some don't like them? who knows
) The service was delightful - friendly and attentive - and the atmosphere is homey and quaint without being twee
Of course, I went on a rainy holiday afternoon, not at prime after-work scamming time, so maybe things are different
Sure, the staff is still working a few kinks out of the system, but Clarke's is a winner, hands down
The atmosphere is bold, the crowd is fun and local (NOT BT as other reviewers have suggested
), and the food is delicious (try the Veal Parm on Wed
night for a treat)
And where else in this city can you grab a beer, look at the table next to you, and see Jake LaMotta smoking a cigar beneath a picture of himself and his Raging Bull counterpart DeNiro?
The bartenders couldn't be more courteous and friendly
The bar scene is great

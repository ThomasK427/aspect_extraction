The outdoor garden tends to stink a bit in the hot summer months
Great Staff, Great Drinks, Great food
Its your typical irish pub with midtown clientele and a nice vibe
i work in the area and go to cassidy's pretty often for lunch
the food is consistantly good and the staff are quite nice
i don't understand the negatives listed about them below, but i think tourists think we're all rude
recommended
This is an Irish Pub that appears to gear towards more of a tourist crowd with their somewhat close proximity to Times Square
There are several TV's around the bar, but none are very large
Prices are reasonable, $4
50 for a bottle of Coors Light, and the staff is friendly
They have Karaoke nights at 10:00 on Fridays
The bathrooms are in decent shape
It's located a few blocks away from any other bars so it seems to be a place for hotel guests to finish off a night in NYC than a place where you'd want to have a few drinks and stay for a while
My girlfriend and I visited New York for a girls trip and we were lucky to have been staying accross the street from Cassidy's
Even though we ate our way through the city, (and happy everywhere we tried), Cassidy's was a place we ended up (3) times in 5 days
Every day we went, we tried something new and loved it
Sheppard's Pie, and Fish and Chips are a must try
As most people in New York the help was pleasant but not anything more until we warmed the Irish waitress up who we then enjoyed an hour conversation with
I felt like it was a warm place away from the fast moving hustle and bustle of the city
a group of us came into the city for xmas shopping/birthday celebration and wanted to start our trip in off right and thought a pub with a decent beer selection would be a good start
so we hit cassidy's
we walked in and nobody would seat us
we were rudely told to sit down after we approached someone 10 min
later
the service was miserable
our drinks were thrown on the table and when we asked for a drink menu, we were told to turn around and look at the bar
the food was fabulous
the service left alot to be desired, but everything else was amazing
After a long day of shopping it was a good place for my husband to catch the game and relax
It was not a typical bar-white linenes and attentive service
Typical Irish food was very good and a good value-large portions
Patrons were a mix of adults and kids
Wood return for lunch again
Excellent location off of 5th Ave shopping
This space is amazing
You will be taken back to the Civil War with all the history on the walls
The food and the service is great
They will make you feel like you are at your home
My husband and I came here on 7th January 2004 for our lunch before flying back home to the UK
We were promptly seated - the waitress was very attentive, got us drinks and menus
Once we had ordered etc, the wait for our meal was not long and the food was fabulous
The waitress came back to our table several times to ensure we were well catered for
The restrooms facilities were spotless too - and very modern
I highly recommend it - when I go back to NYC, I shall be making a return visit
This place seems very inviting from the outside - especially on a nice summer evening
When the windows are open, it seems very laid back yet ideal for an after work drink
However, the service is horrible and the wines by the glass are limited and poor
The waiters try to tickle your fancy by giving you a glass of wine on the house due to the extra wait time for your appetizers
DON'T BE FOOLED
Again, the wine has a taste similiar to an everyday beverage each of us consume
water
Save time - go to Monkey Bar instead
Better service w/ better looking crowd and wait staff!!!
This place is incredible
The atmosphere was so hip, without being pretentious
The staff was VERY friendly (and great to look at too I might add), and the decor was beautiful
Great music and food, and DEFINITELY have the chocolate fondue for dessert
Amazing! Also, have the goat cheese salad - the best salad around
Pleasant surprise after shopping in the area
Near the movie theater on Court Street so you can always go to the rest
before or after a show
Atmosphere was great, open breezy place, nice garden area
Food was EXCELLENT!! Try the Goat cheese salad and the Squid ink pasta with seafood
Quiet, atrium setting beautiful room with excellent food! They have an all inclusive prixfixe meal that was fabulous, very good value
Absolutely a hidden Gem in busy new york!
The Scene Right by the approach to the Holland Tunnel, a red awning invites passers-by into this sweet, low-frills spot
It has a diner feel, with industrial flooring and yellow tables
Warmly welcoming service makes it comfortable, though the gloomy lighting leaves room for improvement
The young clientele is drawn from neighboring Soho and Chinatown
The Food The Asian comfort food works: There is a touch of attentive flair to everything, even the rich earthy flavor of the Chinese-sausage sticky rice
A terrific Thai-style steak salad is fiery with jalapenos and garlic, while a massive dose of lime juice and fresh herbs cools it down
The jicama spring rolls are refreshing, and the three wonton soups deeply satisfying; there's a sizeable sandwich of grilled, sweet-glazed pork chops and mango chutney on an Italian roll
I just got back from NYC, and we went all over the place to eat
Mooncake Foods, was, by far, the best
The food was delicious, and it was so affordable
The summer rolls were light and tasted very healthy, in a good way
Both of my friends got the chicken, which came with the most delicious cilantro chili sauce
The sauce was so good that my male friend wanted to take some home
I got the steak kabobs with peanut sauce, which were big and juicy and done to perfection
The service was also wonderful and friendly, and made us feel at home
The only thing was that the restaurant was a bit small - but we got there right on time and didn't have to wait for a table
Whether you are a local or a visitor, this place is not to be missed
I work nearby and I eat here at least once a week, if not more
It is very healthy yet cleverly delicious
You just have to try it to believe it! People who work there are always wonderful
In fact, I think I'm going to have to go there for lunch today
I really can't recommend just one dish because they're ALL good
It's pretty small and it gets packed during lunch time, so you have to go early or slightly late
If you get it to pick-up or deliever, you don't have to worry about that though
This place, although very small and lacks any kind of ambiance makes up for it with its food
Its simply Delicious
everything
I went there with my girlfriend, based on the previous reviews and was amazed
The food, and all the sauces it comes with are Just Great
Really no other words to describe it
The only thing thats better, is the price
you can fill your self up, pig out, and go away with a full wallet
I've been to some expensive places in the city, and the food there wasnt worth the money
I'd gladly pay more if this place raises its prices

The hostess wasn't as nasty as other reviewers have said but I agree that the food sucks
I've had better Chinese food in Chinatown at a cheaper price
I can see that you definitely go there for the girls and not the food
A big dissapointment foodwise but the show made up for the evening
If you are a big bachelorette party and plan on going there, make sure that you pick from the most expensive pre-set menu or they will treat you like crap
Went there and pick the cheapest menu because it had more then enough food for us to eat and we got stuck up front
Of course, the show was going on in the back room
Tried to get our table changed forget it
The host was like that's where you are sitting so don't bother me anymore
In the end the food was good, but if you are looking for fun try another place
I have never ever met so many rude waiters and hosts and I'm from New York
After waiting to get a table for over a half hour even though we had reservations, we went up to the host
He/she answered that the table is being setup and that we must wait
10 minutes later we came up again and the host looked annoyed
He said in the angriest manner possible:I said u have to wait
Dont be coming up asking me again!
After another 20 minutes, we came up and that's when they started screaming at us for bothering them
When we finally said that we are going to leave since we cannot wait anymore, they yelled curse words at us
It was the worst experience ever
So many places in New York to have fun and pleasant time, there is no reason why people should ever go to this disgusting dump
So much fun
We came for my friend 21 birthday and we had a blast
We got treated very nicely at every level Brie our waitress was wonderful the show was great and if you are coming to lucky Cheng's you have to get a private lap dance with Desiree you will bring back picture and memories that you won't forget
WHAT A BLAST! THIS PLACE IS OVER THE TOP
I WAS SKEPTIAL AT FIRST BUT QUICKLY RELIZED I WAS WORNG
THE DRAG QUEENS ARE FABULOUS, THE FOOD IS GREAT
I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE IN NEW YORK DONT MISS THIS SHOW
Love 2 for 1 happy hour during the week days and weekends too! Very nice (and hot) bartenders
Was there for World Cup Finals and it was a big party and had a lot of fun
Food is good and alot to choose from
Good place to meet up with a few friends, or for a casual date
HappyHour (buy1get1) until 8 pm
Its tight inside, but there's heated outdoor seating, good for smokers
Great playlist, great music
Interesting menu, lots of really fresh twists, and prices really aren't bad (young people can totally handle the tab
3 Friends and I shared a huge appetizer, had dinner, and drinks (pink margaritas!) whole tab was under $60, thanks to happyhour)
The club in the back has a two drink minimum; no cover for singer/song writer type acts every night
Service can be slow, but nice
They're hipsters, give them a break! Its hard to be ultra-cool and serve a packed dining room at the same time
For a better way to get there, take quick 10 minute walk: Take the L train to 1st Ave and 14th, Walk South to 6th, East to Ave A
Service was horrible, rude staff, very sub par food, and it took about an hour for the food to come out
I do not reccomend you go to this place
We were ending Halloween with White Russians with a float of coffeee, when some friends from another party arrived
The bartendar took our order, but then proceeded to service the whole bar before us (which was pretty strange since there were only 8 people in the bar, so it was pretty obvious)
We reordered our drinks, thinking she had forgot, but she just shook her head and gestured to the people at the bar (her friends, I don't know)
After ten minutes we cancelled our order, at which point she mockingly thanked us and we left the bar
I don't know who the rude bartendar was, but this happened the night of October 29th
This is a pleasant little bar
If you are one for live music by aspiring musicians/singers
this is your spot
The food and service is good
Its great during the summer
In a great neighborhood; with a lot more bars in the area
Go there, have a burger, beer and live music for eye-candy
I was pleasantly surprised by this place
I was expecting its food and service to be atrocious
But the waiter was very accomodating; he brought extra garlic bread at no charge, was attentive, and apologized profusely for not allowing us to order from the 12-and-under kids' menu
The food was also good and reasonably priced; my friend and I split an $8 order of very good (if a little too garlicky) ravioli, and for under $5 my boyfriend had a gigantic breakfast sandwich with fries
The ambience was a little loud and the lighting dim, but what can you expect at 4:30am? (PS: I was totally sober, and the food was still decent
) I wouldn't recommend it so highly during daytime, and I'd be wary of the more ambitious items on the menu, but the pasta and breakfast were passable, satisfying food, especially late at night
I occasionally would end up there, because it's so convenient, but I refuse to ever deal with the service again
Last time I was there for 30 minutes without even getting a menu
There is nothing this place has to offer that would make it worth the hassle of getting your food
Yes, this place has the worst service I have ever experienced in NY
We showed up, ordered promptly and then waited more than twenty minutes before our drinks were served
Then waited even longer for the guac and chips one of us had ordered
We had already heard from one waiter that our waiter had (twenty or so minutes after receiving it) JUST given our order to the kitchen
THEN, the person who carried out the food insisted that we had JUST arrived at the place
I guess I must have just knocked back an entire pint of beer in seconds then
hmmmm
never again!
Went here with a friend by chance and we were so pleasantly surprised! Good food @ good prices
Service was slow but the servers were the friendliest I've had in NY
Great happy hour deal
Relaxed, varied crowd
Going back tonight in fact!
OK, these previous posts are weirdoes
I can't speak on the food, but I went there for a show the other week and here is my experience: one of the friendliest servers ever (no attitude); the drinks were avg
price, but they were buy one get one free before 8pm; the music was the ish
Have you seen Regina Spektor? See is pretty much unbelievable
This joint does not deserve any hype, but I assure you it isn't a disgrace as previous posts may say
It's true, Sidewalk is has the worst service known to man
I use to go hear VERY often, but then realized that I was always complaining about the PAINFULLY slow service and the inept waitresses/waiters
Now I venture across the street to 7A where the food AND service are always better
Even Leshko's and Odessa beat Sidewalk's service
Maybe having a beer and catching music are better, but for food run to 7A
Good for a casual meal and drinks, but service can be slow
This place is a disgrace to the East Village
How it stays this popular, I have no idea
The only thing it has going for it is that it is open 24 hours
I recommend only going here if you are stumbling past at 4:30 in the morning, too drunk to care if your food has any flavor or not
I have been there twice
The first time was crappy enough that I am not sure why I went back
The second time sealed the coffin
We all agreed it was the blandest food ever
And the mac 'n cheese they claim is homemade?
From scratch, my butt
The only thing they did was scratch open the box of Kraft
There are at least 10 places better than this dump within a 1 block radius, so don't waste your precious time and taste-buds on this culinary insult
The frozen mudslides are a must for any steamy summer evening

It's a great space
but the food just doesn't live up to its expectations
If you decide to go just stick to the guacamole and margaritas!
I'm not sure what to think of Dos Caminos
It's a beautiful space and the service is friendly, but the food is lackluster - except for the guacamole
Even though it's $12, it's out of this world
I normally hate guac, but I loved this stuff
The pork entree had a bitter aftertaste and featured big blobs of fat scattered throughout - pretty gross
The chicken mole was unexciting, and the black beans needed more flavor
The chocolate torte reminded me of a cold Entenmann's cake dusted with cinammon (to make it Mexican, I guess)
All in all, it's a bit over-hyped for what you actually get food-wise, but it's a great atmosphere
From the guacamole made table-side to the authentic Mexican desserts, Dos Caminos was an amazing experience
I felt as if I was traveling through Mexico without ever leaving Park Avenue
A great date place or an evening with friends and family
As usual, New Yorkers flock to what's hot, desperately seeking the novel in the everyday
This week it's Dos Caminos
But New Yorkers don't buy into BS either, so give it a couple more weeks and it'll be off the social radar altogether because no amount of hype can make up for all that's lacking in quality
Empanadas were inexcusably soft and soggy, lobster tacos could have been filled with fake crab for all I could tell, shrimp and rice might have found a better home as part of an airplane meal
Drinks? Shame upon shame
Despite a delectable collection of tequilas our waiter messed up our order not once but TWICE
The bar was unappealing, the service was shoddy, the space was overcrowded and there isn't that much that can be done to compensate for being seated half an hour after a scheduled reservation
Cool design and atmosphere
Nice service
While not expensive, the food is okay but not worth it
Guacamole a la Rosa Mexicano was hardly comparable to the real thing
Tuna and shrimp/scallop ceviches forgettable
Mexican chopped salad fine
However, the chicken tacos were good
Great food, great atsmosphere! It made for a fun evening
The service was excellent
Would definitely go again soon!
I don't know what all the negative reviews are about
Every dish we had was great
I highly recommend the shrimp tacos and the mahi mahi
And the prices weren't outrageous for NY either
But do try to get one of the very cozy booths, where you don't even notice that other people are around
I thought this place was great! The drinks were good, the staff curteous and the food was really good! I would definitely go back
Impersonal and large volume restaurant, but the ambience was nice
The meal started out well- good drinks and GREAT guacamole, but it went downhill from there
The food was bad- I got empanadas and enchiladas and they were both so bad, I couldn't even force myself to eat them
And the worst part is the waiter actually told me that they were delicious and he recommened them with a (fake) smile! I think the waitstaff recommends everything on the menu, so don't trust them
The dinner was romantic because we got there at 5:30 pm, when the place was virtually empty, but as it got to 6:30 it got packed and was very crowded and noisy and they made the lights brighter
We left $150 lighter (for Mexican food!) and disappointed in yet another Park Ave dud
We regretted we didn't go to NoBu instead
highly highly overrated! After hearing about this restaurant for weeks, I finally tried it
The chicken enchiladas were filled with dark chicken meat with visible fat
disgusting
The atmosphere was nice with low lighting
The bar area is very small so it is not a good place to go for a drink
The one saving grace of the evening was the Sangria--a good value at $21 a carafe
Overall unimpressed and would not recommend it
I live a few blocks away and took a restaurant industry friend visiting from Chicago to Dos Caminos on a Sunday night for a light dinner
We were seated by the friendly front of house staff immediately
The waiter was attentive and the interior was perfect, very hip and tasteful design aesthetic
Our white sangria was fine, not outstanding
The guacomale was FABULOUS, better than Rosa Mexicano
Her bass was good, but next time I'll try the shrimp, it looked great
I'll definitely head back
Went to Dos Caminos last night
Food was ok, but not worth the 1 hour wait (we sat down an hour after our reservation time) If you are going to make people wait a LONG time, then at least build a bigger bar
The rest of the chain of restaurants is great, what happened here?!?!
Althought the menu is more expensive than your average Mexican restaurant, it is not more expensive than any other hip, increadibly well designed, bar scene and dining room in Manhattan -could be less in fact
The guacamole gets rave reviews and it's very good but not something to write home about - keep in mind that the people preparing it by your table are american servers
not mexican gourmands! The food is good
The traditional Mexican dishes seem to be the real winners, while the more designed dishs had mixed reviews (great Tuna, mediocre Lobster and Shrimp)Great mixed drinks
Bottom line: If you like Mexican and you love a hip New York scene go there
You won't be disappointed
Very stylish, chi-chi setting
Hip, well-dressed, young crowd
Service was average, and apart from the excellent guacamole, the food was disappointing
The girls behind the front bar had to be the most pretentious snobs I've ever come in contact with
If you are looking for rude service, over-priced drinks, over-crowded atmosphere and under-acheiving food, this is the place for you
I will not be back for seconds
Finally a trendy and more upscale mexican restaurant! The atmosphere was fabulous
great decor
very spacious, warm
the place was totally upbeat and energetic
the menu spanned from simple mexican to more complex dishes with some added flare and everything was delicious
do not miss out on the guacamole which is made tableside
stick with the basic margarita
we tried the others but the basic was best
our waiter was extremely friendly and took the time to make lots of suggestions
I will definitely be going back!
I went there on Hallooween night
After all the reviews I read, I was expecting much more of the food
The decor is really nice, I especially liked the lamps hanging from the wall
We had reservations and were seated promptly ( the place was very crowded)
The service was O
K, nothing fantastic
The guacamole was prepared in front of us and was GREAT!!!
I had some enchiladas that were OK
You could find the same food at any regular cheap mexican
The margaritas were good
It's a place to check out
This is not your typical Mexican restaurant
The menu was quite diverse and offered more than just tacos and enchiladas
I highly recommend the sweet corn mash side item
I also recommend getting there early(5:30- 6:00) if you don't have a reservation
The service is best when your one of few in the place
My girlfriend and came here last night and came away very impressed with the food and the service

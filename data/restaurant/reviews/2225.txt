Our friends from France, who we took there , confirmed my impression both food and atmosphere wise
We like their veteran waitress a skinny lady, who walks briskly like a ballerina and has a cute uptight angular properness
The food feels very authentic
We liked everything we tried
My favorites are cold Foie Gras, Bouillabaisse and Souffl
They dont decorate dishes much, which I think is a plus because it harmoniously complements the experience
The service is fast and friendly with a dash of polite aloofness, which I crave sometimes, especially in the Times Square area
The surroundings are pleasant
Soft French background music and themed wall features definitely feed your nostalgic half
Unobtrusive restaurant scenery matches the encounter
Sometimes their matriarch chef Grand-mere takes break at the bar silently sipping her wine
Occasionally PBS-type celebrities pop in
My wife and I have dined at this wonderful French bistro several times and we love it
Charming, romantic, and definitely authentic
If you'd like to practice your French language skills, go right ahead, because the wait staff are all French speaking
This bistro is not overpriced like other French restaurants and it is not trendy either
I've travelled to France and I can truthfully say that Chez Napoleon is the closest I've seen in New York to match the restaurants in France
This is a family owned and operated business and the head chef is an old Frenchwoman who manages to whip up some amazing sauces for the meat, poultry or seafood dishes that are on the menu
Allez a Chez Napoleon toute de suite!
Though not necesarrily impressive or lavish, very quaint, cozy, and conducive to conversation
Good food (a tad on the pricey side, but hey, it's in the theater district), friendsly service, an overall recommend for the right situation
This place looks as authentic as the people working there
My boyfriend and I went there before a show and enjoyed a nice leisurely paced dinner with what looked and smelled like a good home cooked french meal
I'm not the biggest fan of french food but this place was romantic and friendly!!
You can't tell a book by it's cover! A wonderful dining expierience
Just try itm and you will be sold
This is a great place for lunch if you work nearby
They sometimes have specials for only $2
99 and those are awesome too
I recommend their tonkatsu curry and soba noodles
the four of us split the chicken tikka masala, beef vindaloo, and the mushroom shag
each entre was about $15 all of the entres come with rice and some of them come with naan or poori as well
the chicken consisted of tender chunks of white meat chicken in a creamy tomato sauce
the beef vindaloo was very spicy, but it was pretty good
the shag was loaded with mushrooms and was well-flavoured
portions arent very large, but there was an adequate amount of food for the four of us
in general, the food was pretty good but there are definitely better indian restaurants in the city (eg
haveli, mitali east, baluchis) for this price range
the staff was nice and service was prompt
its an ok choice for the rockefeller/times sq area since theres not much inexpensive or good food there
Not Recommended
A vacation ruined! Planned on having a nice evening with friends, but was very disappointed with the service, the attitude of all staff
We ordered 3 items for 3 people, a total of $45
The waiter stated the food is not enough for us three and we needed to order more
Also stated that his boss would get upset if we did not order a $10 min per person
We said this is $15 over your MIN, however the waiter did not understand what we were saying
Finally we went to the manager, who was acting DUMB, like he did not know what we were talking about
We decided that we did not want to eat at a restaurant that did not respect the customer, and they stated we need to pay $5
00 for papad, we did not eat
Common, everone knows Papad costs 50 cents a packet
My wife and I have eaten here several times a year for ayleast thirty years
The food is good basic Indian food
Be careful of the vindaloo, they are not kidding when they say Highly spiced
The bread is always fresh, the poori and nan are always good
Located in the theatre district, you can tell your waiter that you have to make a curtain and have each course served quickly
But we have often lingered with friends for several hours
Because it is on the second floor and thus has a lower rent I consider this resturant a very good value
It was the first time i had indian food and although what i ordered i didnt enjoy but what my friends did, i devoured
thats why you have friends right? :)  Well, my friend ordered the masala chicken i just ate pretty much every bit of it including the sauce
The bread was delicious
The ambiance was ok, nothing great, but i dont think it makes a difference when you dont have time to look around just enjoy the food
The service was quick and friendly and i will definitely go again
As a vegetarian, I have eaten at many Indian restaurants over the years
This by far has been the worst
I had Vegetable Korma and my friends had Chicken Korma and Saag Ponir
All these dishes had the same bland, almost white sauce
Korma should be a rich, creamy and flavorful
I understand the 2 Kormas being the same, but the Saag? If it wasn't for salt and the fact that I love the flavor of vegetables by themselves, this dish would have been inedible
If it weren't for it's location in Times Square, no one would eat there
If you're looking for Indian, try Haveli downtown
Was in the neighborhood and decided to venture to this place after noticing how crowded it was and was later disappointed at the blandness and how expensive the food was
From soup to rice and entrees to appetizers, the food was literally bland and plain
I'm not sure if the cook was uninspired that night but they seemed like they lacked flavor as they did presentation
The service was quite good thankfully, even their diligence couldn't save the food
They ended up crediting us the bill for the items we didn't even touch after a couple of bites, at least they had some understanding and that is certainly worth noting
Interior wise, it feels cramped with a bar and dining room all meshed into one with a TV blaring in the background
Revisiting this place may be worth returning for drinks only
I used to live in the neighborhood and go here often
This was my first trip back since the move
It was a whole new world
The 'medium' guacamole had no salt and a big after taste
My date's chimichanga was the size of a nutrigrain bar
And my meal - their vegetable chili - was a medium sized $12 bowl of watery bowl of minestrone soup
To make it worse, after dropping off the food, the waiter never came back to check on us and our horrible meal
The margaritas are good - so happy they should stick to happy hour
Went there last night and although I have probably had better Mexican food, it's still pretty good especially for the value
It's really inexpensive and the service is decent
The decor is cheesy but I like it for what it is
It can accommodate big groups too
I really like this place and would definitely recommend it
The service was friendly and the place was fun, if way too loud, but let's face it: This food is garbage
Vegetables were instantly recognizable as having come from a can or frozen bag
Most items were from packages (salsa, chips, etc
) The temperatures of the food were totally random: My date's meal was lukewarm at best, the guac was ICE cold (I mean, it should be cool, but not frosty), the refried beans were piping hot
It made no sense
This is crap food, which is totally ridiculous considering the immense number of fine, inexpensive Mexican joints in NYC
Perhaps we're jaded by the legitimate Mexican places we love in Brooklyn, but we'll never be visiting this place again
I have been worldwide to every restaurant and El Azteca is by far the best restaurant
They have great food,great drinks especially the Margaritas
guouuu, the service is tooo much

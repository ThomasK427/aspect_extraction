The experience is great, but it's the pies that make this place what it is
And no idea if the concept of sausage rolls exists in New York - but it does now
Great value, friendly service and tucker to die for
I live right across the street and though i like to experiment other places, this is by far the best place for miso black cod
Everything is fresh and great for the price
Whenever I have a sushi craving, i stop by
like 1-2 times a week
I would like to take a different approach to Momoya's previous reviews
I find this restaurant to be completely the opposite: seemingly cool from the outside, but disappointingly average on the inside
Don't get carried away by the decor
Yes, it is nice, but we go to restaurants to eat
When you eat, you will realize Momoya is nothing special
The best thing this restaurant has going for itself is its location
I've eaten here four times (the second, I thought it needed a second chance; the third and fourth, it was convenient), and every time I keep telling myself not to go back
The fish is OK, but sushi/sashimi are foods not worth eating unless it's at least good
The service is worse than the food
Each of my visits something was off
Thinking about trying Momoya? Try ordering Japanese take-out, chances are it will be better than there
This is a great find of a restaurant
It looks completely average from the outside but is actually a cool space
The food is very fresh, the speciality rolls (particularly the ryukyu) are creative, and the service was excellent
It's a shade below the best sushi restaurants, but well worth the price and much better than most other sushi restaurants that charge the same price
The food was really good and I enjoyed the sushi
Service was awesome and I plan to go back there again!
Hip place in a great neighborhood
Finally a good sushi place hits Chelsea
Also, the prices won't kill the wallet
I'd highly recommend the place
Try it
New the hood, I thought this would be my new hang out, stylish, semi-cheap and seemingly hip
The food is usually great, but really chaotic, servers always apolgize for the slap shod way it comes
There seems to be no manager, just a host who doesn't know how long the wait will be, and waiters stationed by the door puttin in orders
The sushi is awesome enough that I'll go back, but the place doesn't seem to want to match the decor
I just came back from this new addition to chealse and I my stomach is full and bank is still too
Me and my wife had 3 appetizers like Sardine tempura salad and Black cod with spinach then I had the amazing Sea bass and she had some sushi and we spent less than some appetizers from any of the other places that we have been to latley
I think I found my new favorite place to eat
P
S
Try their home made Cheese cakes, We had the caramel next time I'm getting the Penutbutter and chocolate
As we walked into the well decorated, fashionable 'calm' home-place, we had the best tasting Sea Bass - it was one of kind; I highly recommend it
And also fresh sashimi at reasonble prices was great as well
The volume of the food was just right! Overall, it was a very enjoyable and tasty experience
Real Euro vibe to this place - for better or worse! Better = mainly, fun space
Worse = indifferent service
Food was good
The Salmon was noticeably fresh
I went for lunch and had a grilled tuna steak over salad
It was amazing! highly recommended!
I went there on last friday night with my husband, thought we should try a Mediterranean Restaurant or have nice cocktail before our Theater
I thought the bar was fair in terms of decor, but how long do you have wait at the bar before a bartender with an attitude (he wasn't rude, but not friendly) makes you an awful drink, but food was delightful and music light and tasty as well
Let's give another try
The interior design was quite impressive but that is as far as it went
I had a difficult time cutting though the heavy accents of the servers/bartender
The food was just ok
I guess if there is a choice of the fast food on 6th avenue and Sensa it would be tough
I think the place would do better as a diner which is what the food really is
The club atmosphere in the evening makes it undesireable to bring children as well
I had eaten at Sensa a couple of times when it first opened, and dare say it was a bit lacking
I decided to give it another chance a couple of weeks ago, and have been back three times since
The food has done a complete 360, and everything I have tried has been excellent!!! The atmosphere is lively, and the bar is really nice as well! I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants great food in a relaxed atmosphere, oh and you won't break the bank, everything on the menu is reasonably priced
Enjoy!!!
I ate there this past monday and it was excellent! I had the chicken and mozarella panini which was to die for! the price was very reasonable, and it came with a small salad and fries, we ate outside which was great because we got to people watch while enjoying a great lunch
Will go again!
WAS THERE SUNDAY , WEATHER WAS GREAT, FOOD AND SCENE EXCELLENT
THE CHEF MUST REALLY LIKE HIS JOB
THE SCENE WAS AMAZING
BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE
SERVICE COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER
Sensa is a great place for consistantly good food and people watching
There is a DJ every night so you can hang out after dinner for drinks by the bar
Sunday brunch is a must! The service is great and the Sensa Cosmo and the steak sandwich are my favorites
as is the Chai Creme Brulee
This is definitely a Chelsea hot spot
Had a chance to check out this place last night
The food was SO good, but it was hard to decide what to eat from a such a great selection
The DJ played mostly old school, 70s music (a little too loud though)
Service was super fast
Definitely check it out!
If you come anywhere near this place, RUN! I went for brunch on a Sunday morning and everything was terrible- the food, the service, and the ambiance
The pancakes I ordered were nothing like the menu's description
When I told the manager, he could care less! He was rude and didn't even apologize for the kitchen's mistake
The plain pancakes I was served were so overdone and chewy that I would barely cut, let alone eat, them
Here's my advice: If you're in Chelsea looking for a cool place, don't go here
This is truly one of the worst
I just wanted to post that this restaurant is poor
The service was terrible, the food was fair -- at best -- and it really is not even worth trying
we came to the restaurant from manhatten
we found the resraurant overpriced and the meals undersized! when we got to the desert we didnt like it and wanted to replace it
the chef stormed out of the kitchen and started yelling at us
i ignored the bad reviews here because of the good ones! there are plenty good expensive restaurants in manhatten with no angry chefs! don't go unless you want dinner and a show:)
I went with a group of six, and we had a great time
The food was superb, the waitstaff friendly and helpful
I had the escargot with spaetzle, which was tasty if not as finished as some of the other plates
The beet salad was fantastic, and the duck was perfect
The staff recommended excellent wines that didn't break the bank, and they were very inclusive: I didn't feel like an idiot because I wasn't en expert
A new entry on my very short list of favorite restaurants
I have been going here since they opened
I love the fact that the menu changes daily they use fresh and organic produce
For $25 you get three full courses and I never leave hungry
I bring friends who come in from out of town and they love it as well

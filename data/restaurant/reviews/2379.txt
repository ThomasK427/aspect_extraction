The bartender was nice enough too
Only spend an hour there, but to meet for an early evening drink before going elsewhere with a date (or eating there I guess), I'd do it again here
This is the best restaurant to take our out of town parents
The atmosphere is fantastic, you feel like you're in a little French restaurant in Vietnam
It's easy on the ears, but not dead quiet
Even if it's cold outside, this interior makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside
Love the gently turning rattan fans on the ceiling
As for the food, it's great, I had a delicious shrimp dish in coconut sauce, my dad had a whole Sea Bass, it was perfectly crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside
We had a fabulous and authentic Key Lime Pie for dessert
Enjoy
I have to say, I have never dined in the downstairs area
We always go to the loungy-type area upstairs
The food is just ok, kinda greasy-spoonish for this kind of place, but somehow they make up for it
It's a nice sexy-ish atmosphere in Midtown, when we're too lazy to go to, say, SoHo or the Village
Servers are sexy but kinda slow, the crowd is a bit commuter-ish
but somehow it works for us! Drinks are yummy
There are hundreds of restaurants in NYC where you can get the same dishes served here for less than half the price
Don't get me wrong, the dishes were quite good and their wine list lends favorably to the menu
But you will pay a premium for location and decor
But all the positives are negated by the service here which is impersonal, hurried and rushed
Waiters grabbed empty glasses and automatically re-filled w/o asking and obviously charging you for it
Do NOT sit in the middle of the restaurant as you will undoubtedly get bumped all night by the waitstaff scurrying about trying to get patrons in and out in record time
I even had a waiter who was carrying a tray of beers actually TELL me to get out of the way as I was making my way towards the door
no lie
Venture elsewhere please!
Had drinks at the upstairs bar at LeColonial last night
I can't comment on the food or service because we didn't eat, though the menu sounded great and I would like to come back for dinner! The drink menu was very creative with lychee martinis and vietnamese sangria
The bar was beautiful, with dark wood on the ceiling, candles and potted palms in the corners
Music was very cool and not too loud
Definitely a laid-back classy lounge feel
Drinks can be ordered at the bar or at tables with waitstaff
It did not get crowded but there were plenty of customers
It's a great place for intimate conversation over an exotic cocktail!
Unless you like getting bumped by waiters and people walking by, do not sit at a middle table
Otherwise, the food was pretty good
I would recommentd the snapper, pork, or shrimp
I thought the duck was ok, but not that interesting
The mango sundea and keylime pie were good
When you're from a small town in the South, restaurant variety is limited
Coming to NYC, you want to try something different
At the same time, glitz may not be your thing either
My wife and I found Le Colonial to be a happy medium
Reservations made on-line Friday evening (for Sat 7 pm) were confirmed on Sat
afternoon
Upon arrival, we were seated promptly
The service was efficient friendly and we weren't rushed
The food was excellent and no more expensive than we were accustomed to paying in a nice restaurant back home
A good place for out-of-towners to experience something different without intimidation!
talk about p
y
t
! lots of lookers
been there when smoking was ok then when it was banned
still eye popping crowd
as for dining downstairs, thought food was very good, but pricey so I come on expense acct
svc
is suspect
ambiance is nice but tables/seating is very tight
SUM IT: I always recommend to others on expense acct
best in small groups
This is a restaurant frequented by locals
You feel comfortable eating along as a single female or with group of friends
The food is always very good, and the service fine
This place is great! I went there on a date and loved it so much that I went back two nights later
The decor is very Vietnamese and low lighted, perfect for a romantic dinner, but upstairs is loud for bigger groups
Service was excellent with a great menu of wines
The duck and Snapper were extremely tasty dishes
Decor is beautiful, as well as the people
The bar upstairs is great for the thirty something crowd
I saw lots of first dates meeting up here
Good choice boys! But the food had it's highs and lows
Spring rolls and begniets (sp?) were delish, as well as the curry shrimp, but the ribs had absolutely no flavor, the shrimp and sugar cane was also tasteless, and the tamerind duck was awful
Items were either full of flavor or no flavor at all
I would come back b/c it is near my apt and the atmosphere is nice, but for really yummy Vietnamese go to Lanaan on third ave in the 20's
Much more reliable
Maybe just drinks and apps next time
First, only one vegetarian choice on the menu-- stir fried veggies
And I can do it better at home using a recipe in a Vietnamese cookbook I have
Second, the fried whole fish with sweet and sour sauce was just ok
A decent Chinese restaurant could do it
Third, normally we do not order dessert, but they brought dessert menus without asking if we wanted any
Once you see the dessert menu it is harder to refuse
Nothing negative to say about the desserts though, at least the ones we ordered
Last but not least, as for the highly touted ambiance, if imagining you're a French colonialist in Vietnam is your thing, then you should give it a try
The (Asian) waiters were calling me Lady, I guess trying to replicate Madame
Personally I don't go for that kind of stuff
When I'm in the mood for a nice, reliable Franco-Vietnamese meal, this is the place I turn to
Service can be a bit disjointed sometimes, so be aware
And the tables in the middle of the room get smacked by waiters/customers going by
But food and ambience make up for it (somewhat)
to 1940s Saigon
Le Colonial's main dining room caters to a mature, well-heeled crowd, who will appreciate the gorgeous surroundings: bamboo accents, ceiling fans, dim lighting
Upstairs, pretty young things throw back cocktails, smoke to their hearts' content, and bop their heads to a groovy electronica soundtrack
Whichever route you decide to take, the destination is the same: Le Colonial's supremely elegant, wonderfully tasty food
It's light yet filling, and very reasonably priced, both for the location and for the quality
Specials are invariably excellent, but you really can't go wrong with any items on the menu
And the service remains stellar
I love the ambience here! You definitely don't feel like you're in New York City in the present day
The Pho soup is delicious and for those who love spicy stuff, this soup will def
clear your sinuses! The scallops special is grilled perfectly, not soft and soggy at all, just firm yet your teeth easily slice through it! The seabass melts in your mouth like butter

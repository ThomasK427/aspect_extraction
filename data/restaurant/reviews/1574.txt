the japanese element of the food has to do w/the polite service and the very small portions
The Scene Low lighting and candles abound
It's all either terribly romantic, or like an upscale Medieval Times, depending on how you look at it
Exposed beams and chunky rough-hewn chairs back up the latter hypothesis, while iron chandeliers aflame with dripping candles follow the former
The Food The menu is a greatest-hits version of Mediterranean, Italian and Pan-Asian dining, with everything from hummus to sashimi
Once you've tasted a few of the Asian-inflected options, like tempura-battered spicy tuna rolls or the black cod with a rich miso glaze, you'll realize where the strengths lie
Veer instead to cavatelli served in cream sauce
Save room for dessert, as an ooey-gooey warm chocolate cake is just the thing you'll want to feed to your date
Date night for my girlfriend and I led us here, off Union Square Park
Since it was still early (6-ish), we were sat immediately to a cozy booth near the back
We loved the atmosphere; it was quiet and not crowded at all
The Candela menu was diverse - from sushi to hamburgers - and everything looked good! Happily, their pre-fixe menu included enough items off the regular menu so that we didn't feel forced into choosing something cheap just because we were paying the pre-fixe price
The wait staff was super-friendly and attentive, and when the wine my girlfriend chose wasn't available, we were offered a similar, higher priced wine for the lower price
Our server, Ryan, made recommendations and was very polite
Our dishes were cleared quickly but we did not feel rushed at all, as they let us sit leisurely with our wine between courses
We'll be back, definitely!
My boyfriend took me here for our 3rd year anniversary on 7-6-06 and it was wonderful! The food was delicious, the service attentive, and the ambience was perfect
This restaurant is sleek yet casual
We saw people who dressed corporate to summer casual and from my view, everyone was treated equally
Enjoy!
The food was mediocre, big-haired blingy BT crowd, and there was a really gross critter scurrying around in the bathroom
I went on a Friday night only because there was no wait
Lots of empty tables at peak time
Should have been a big clue
Foolishly, we stayed, we ate, we regretted it
The servers were also kind of strange and inept, esp considering that the place was pretty empty
More of a happy hour type of place
Don't go for dinner and don't subject a date to this mediocrity
This is a place, while not a high end restaurant, it is great for the type of place it is and I would go there again
It is lit up almost entirely with candles with some electrical backlighting along the walls
The service was extremely good
The food was okay, but it was not meant to be the finest cuisine either
I liked it quite a bit
It was spacious
Go there for the ambience if nothing else
A friend and I happened upon Candela accidentally (all thanks to my keen intuition)
The atmosphere encourages close contact with your date and intimate conversations
The sake martini is awesome (but make sure they use ketel one vodka; they tried to pass absolut off as ketel)
This was also my first time having sushi and I was pleasantly surprised
I booked a table for Valentine's Day
I had heard this restaurant was the ultimate romantic spot in NY
Well, it's romantic in that there are candles and flowers everywhere
But the restaurant is huge, and the set-up felt more like cafeteria-style, with up to 12 small tables lined up in about 10 rows down the middle of the room
The 3-course menu was $75 prix-fixe per person
no drinks
I frequent restaurants in Greenwich Village, Union Square, etc
I am accustomed to Manhattan prices for good food
And these were not justified
The food was boring and lacking in both flavor and freshness
It seemed like it had been mass-produced about 4 hours beforehand (probably was, considering the limited choices offered to the hundreds of couples they seated that night
) The whole experience felt orchestrated, timed, and highly impersonal
One more gripe: ESPN at the bar?
my friend had made reservations for a group of 12 for my birthday
although our party fully arrived 20 minutes after the reserved time, we were not seated until another hour later
the manager comped us a few appetizers for our long wait after my friend complained
the menu was otherwise very bland: most dishes that anyone with a recipe and a kitchen can whip up themselves
i asked for my steak RARE and it came out well done, which i promptly sent back
i guess dark=romantic but if that's the case, there are plenty of other romantic restaurants in new york that serve much better food
Went here before going to the theatre and I just loved it
The food was great, the atmosphere was great
Really enjoyed it
Great place to take a date or family!
I have been to Candela numerous times however last nite I went to Candela and it was just amazing
If you want to have the true Candela experience I think you need to go in the middle of the week when it is not crowded
The service was great, food was amazing and I ALWAYS get their chocolate cake
WOW!! What a great restaurant
My date and I had the absolutely most tasty meals, the atmosphere was superb and the staff, from the busboy to the general manager made us feel welcome and special
I highly recommend the Roasted Chicken from the dinner menu - it was awesome! This restaurant is run with incredible efficiency and skilled staff
We will definately be back soon!
we came here for brunch on a sunday afternoon
the place is amazing
it's dark, but the place was lit with candles everywhere
loved the chandeliers
the service was excellent
food itself wasn't bad
thinking about coming to this place for dinner one of these night
Went to dinner last night with a close friend of mine after the rave and high praise Candela receives
The ambiance and setting was definately to my liking with all the candels theme
Food presentation was nice and service was good as well
Would recommend this place and definately go back
Celebrated our anniversary recently and thoroghly enjoyed our evening
I had the Tuna and n\my husband had the pork chops
Sushi appetizers were a excellent
We are in our 60's but enjoyed seeing so many young couples enjoying themselves as much as we were
Will return soon
I went there with my date-friday-and our waiter was great-Rodrigo-
He made great suggeestions about the food and wine along with being very friendly
The food was a good compliment to our waiter and the candle/gothic feel
We will definetely be back
Let me preface this by first saying that I am not overly high-maintenance when it comes to eating out
That said, we had an awful experience at Candela
Started the minute I walked in - TV with the game on at the bar? This is not a romantic introduction
Then the huffy hostess when we asked to be seated at a table not directly on-top of another couple
The ribs were undercooked and we sent them back - first time my boyfriend has ever sent food back
My meal? Never came! 15 minutes after his meal came, I told the waitress (who was very nice - I felt bad for her) not to bother
Also, this is the most romantic restaurant you've ever been to - if you've only eaten at Hooters
It's theme-parkish
VERY BT crowd, with drunk table screaming in the back room
What an awful experience!
I took my girlfriend to Candela for her birthday and we had a great time everything was wonderful from the white chocolate martinis to are wonderful server Jamie the food was great too

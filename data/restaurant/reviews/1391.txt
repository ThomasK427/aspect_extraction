cozy (which is hard to do)
Pasta is spectacular
We did (Spaghetti With crab, scallions and jalapeno, Tagliatelle Verde Al ragu bolognese, and Bucatini Alla gricia)
All 3 were phenomenal
My fave was the tagliatelle, with my friends being the spaghetti
We followed this with the Risotto Barolo, which was OUTSTANDING
This was the marquee dish of the meal
Entrees fell flat ( bolito misto and duck ), as did dessert (sorbets)
Sardinian wines ( a passion ignited at babbo ) are recommended
Gorge on pasta, risotto wine

My girlfriend and i went for what we thought would be a unique dining experience
What we received was a disjointed, arrogant and frustrating evening
Had a 9:30 reservation and were still not seated by 10:30
Hostess was not the least bit attentive or concerned with seating us
We finally opted to sit in the lounge area adjacent to the bar
We overheard another group talking about the delays as well
Ordered various apps and a salad since we drank our appetites away
Food was average
Nothing really stood out
They did buy us a glass of champagne and apologize but it was a little too little and way too late!
Beautiful restaurant and wonderful service
There is so much room between you and the other diners you don't feel like you are in a NYC restaurant
The service was excellent
We did the traditional tasting menu and we were not that impressed
Some of the courses just were not good
The dessert was the most disappointing
Overall, I would try it once but I don't think this will be a place people will be running back to
After enjoying Felidia and Lupa, I thought this Mario/ Lidia collaboration was a no-brainer
6 of us at and enjoyed 3 courses each, plus after dinner drinks
All the food was very good -- well prepared and tasty -- but not special enough to justify a $40 average entree
The wine list is impressive, but wines that I normally find in the $60-75 range were over $100+
All in all the food just doesn't make the spend worth it
Mario et al
did a great job laying out the over-the-top space so that diners are not on top of each other, which sets the tone for the relaxed (slow?) pace of the meals served there
As for the meal, we found sound great dishes among the antipasti and pasta, but were not as impressed with the entrees
The duck was overseasoned with what seemed to be fennel, and the lamb three ways was remarkably unremarkable
The pasta truly shines, though
Absolutely perfect, as were the apps
Wine list is daunting for those not well-versed in Italian wines, but the sommelier was helpful and efficient
Service, and our server in particular, were great, not as officious or smug as one often finds in the fine dining rooms of NYC
Our reservation was for 9:45pm on a Friday night in January
We arrived early and sat at the bar until 9:48pm when our table was ready
While being shown to our table by a hostess, we were welcomed by Lidia Bastianich herself and seated at a great table in the dining room -- not too secluded, but not noisy
A cook myself, I enjoyed seing the goings-on of the restaurant
The service was fantastic
The food was some of the best that I have ever tasted
Try the pasta sampler
The bucatini, gnocchi, and tagliatelle bolognese are phenomenal
The Sauvignon Blanc by the glass on the wine list is delightful
The Lamb 3 Ways and the Grilled Pork Chop were amazing
Last but not least, the blood orange tea was a great was to end the evening
You'll love it -- as much, if not more than Babbo and Lupa!
Thank goodness I ate some of the meal I cooked for my kids before leaving them with the babysitter, because the $300 we dropped for 4 of us at the Del Posto bar left me starving
Among others, we had a $30 plate of absolutely delicious house-cured meats containing MAYBE 4 oz of meat total
9 tiny, thin slices of meats
If I went into my local gourmand and he tried to charge me $120/lb for anything I'm sure I wouldn't pay it
The full restaurant menu, while not cheap, looked like a much better prospect
So be sure to go for dinner
If you go to the lounge, enjoy a glass of wine and the ambiance
You'll leave hungry either way, but with much more money in your pocket after a glass of wine
Also, we forwent the $29 valet and parked free on the street a block away
Everything ordered was beyond tasty
from Sauteed Mushrooms to the Lobster Risotto (they have their own risotto chef) to the 3-Veal entree, all down to the desert where my wife was speechless
Wine list was full of great italian wines, as the somoliere was helpful but not pushy
Nice open/airy seating, your seat will not touch anyone elses
Great overall experience!!
We had a celebratory holiday meal at Del Posto the day after the official opening on Dec
21st
The service was not good
A server tried to give us coffee after our starters
A table setter gave us new knives and forks before dessert and then took them away
Our rack of lamb took 45 minutes to arrive, a fact that would have given us pause before we ordered it
The servers and busboys generally made more noise that they should (dropping table leaves)
That said, the food was very good
Carciofi alla romana was flavorful and crossed with onions
The seafood salad was fresh and tasty
The calves liver was fantastic
Our lamb (for two) took forever and when it arrived was very very salty
From the quaint cobblestone streets, to the all continental and old american deserts, this is the place to be
See the celebrities and hob-nob with New Yorks great chefs
Fine food if you wish or just Tapas type plates
This was my second try, and it will not be my last
They have everything going on
GO GO GO !!!! I only wish this place was around sooner
you can't go wrong
I am very excited and looking forward to the next Sascha experience when I have a celebrate a birthday a party at SASCHA
Starters were bland and tasteless, tomatoes salad not worth the calories
Gazpacho had no flavor
The Dover sole was like rubber you could bounce a dime off it not worth the $38 price tag
The Tuna stake what a joke we were told the chef likes to serve it rare
It arrived pink and over cooked
The famous strawberry shortcake was dry and and the strawberries were either canned or had been stewing for too long
All in all a waste of time, calories and money
Really not worth ever mentioning again
After reading some of the reviews on Citysearch, I was somewhat reluctant to try Sascha
However, I'm glad I decided to give it a try
It was a beautiful summer night so we dined outside
Our waiter was very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive
His recommendations were fabulous! The food was delicious and reasonably priced

I got neither for lunch
I had to signal at least 4 times for someone to take our orders
My friend also got a cold pastrami sandwich
His plate was hot but the meat was cold
I had to ask several times before anyone brought us water (it was given to us halfway through our meals)
Refills for our coffee was just as hard to get
The server also forgot about our dessert
The food was substandard
I've had better diner food for much less
I asked for the bill and took my server about 15 minutes to give it to me
People who have an hour to spare for lunch need fast, efficient service and a good hot meal to get them through the day
This diner failed on both counts
I went to the Tick Tock Diner 5 or 6 times whilts staying at the New Yorker Hotel (who own it)
The food is very good, as are the staff
The prices are a bit high for a diner in my opinion
A short walk down 8th Avenue will find plenty more diners with cheaper prices
on two trips to new york the tick tock diner has been my choice for breakfast and late night snacks, with a broad selection on the menu and plentiful portions, and gorgeous lemonade! also quite good value for money in an area with few dining options
I go to Tick Tock all the time after shopping
Their menu is broad and the food decent
It's just your basic deli/diner menu
The inside is kind of cute in a campy-tacky diner way
No surprises here
Pretty reliable place to just have fries or a sandwich
Most of the times the wait staff is friendly, although not exceedingly so
The perfectly normal diner experience
I've been coming here for years and have always had a good time
I'm usually there before and/or after Knick games
They have a good beer selection and a nice, typical NYC Irish style bar atmosphere
Definitely go for a burger of some sort
They are HUGE!
This place is a few extra blocks down from the Garden, which makes up for it
It's less crowded on NCAA days and NBA days
You will see some Knick players stroll in after the game
This place has typical bar food with a good selection of beers on tap
Not a place to party all nite for sure Im guessing it's empty an hour after game ends and 10 mins before one starts
I was at this bar the other night with a group of friends and we had a really bad experience
The waitstaff was rude and when we spoke the manager she could have cared less
There are so many bars around Penn Staion yet they acted like we were lucky we were allowed to be there!!! That is the last time I am ever wasting money in a place like this!
My friends and I went for a couple drinks after work
This turned into many drinks and many hours
We didn't feel like ordering dinner and after the third round, asked for a basket of bread (a basket of bread was sitting on almost every table but ours)
They refused our request and were very rude about it
I just don't understand why we can spend lots of $$$$ on drinks but if we had come in and ordered only a small plate of wings- nothing more- we would have gotten what we asked for
VERY rude waitress and manager
Went last night with a couple of friends to catch up and was treated horribly!! The worst bartender, waitress and manager!! Do your self a favor
go to one of the many surrounding bars where you will be treated like a human!! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!
Visited this pub just South of The Garden with my wife and two college-aged kids
The young Irish lass who waited on us was one of my all-time favorites - great service and great timing
Her menu suggestions were right on the money
The two notable meals were my blackened catfish and my son's turkey pot pie - absolutely delicious
We sat alongside the bar - a little noisey but c'mon, I did say this was a NYC pub
I liked it so much that I took plenty of take-home menus and business cards to share with family and friends
Bottom line - we walked away raving about the food, the waitress, the clientele, and, most of all, the reasonable price
Give this one a try, folks
You will not be disappointed
Went here for game 7 sox v yanks
Great crowd great service and good food
Will be back there again soon
Good Irish barmen!!!
At 3PM on a Friday afternoon when the place is all but empty, we should not be waiting 20 minutes for our drinks, especially when the somewhat pretentious Russian waitress walks by our table a dozen times
Other than the poor service, which I have heard from others is not the norm, I have no complaints, good eats plenty of room at our table
Not overly priced when you consider what some other joints in the area are charging
Overall I'd say this is a good stop before heading to a show/game at the garden if you want a clean, relatively quiet atmosphere
A little more upscale than it's little sister, Sally
Still a great place to go for a night out with friends and the food is pretty good, too
the french onion soup was excellent, along with the calmari and garlic bread
but dont go on he firemans memorial day LOL they all seemed to end up there after the ceremony
but luckily they could seat you upstairs away from all the crowd
In Short This shiny chrome-and-turquoise diner, with its retro neon sign and snappy waitresses, is a New York classic
'Round-the-clock hours guarantee an always-colorful spectrum of clientele at the long counter and booths: Toward the back, there's open seating for large parties
Expect renditions of diner standards like burgers, turkey clubs, bagel and lox sandwiches
Don't skip the tall layer cakes and coffee
Great place for quick lunch
Staff is friendly with a little NYC edge
Food isn't fancy but consistenly fresh and tasty
Unbelievable number of ways to have your burger and always served with a smile
Soupy pasta dishes, tasteless vegetables
They don't take Discover
They don't have baklava
I would recommend Starlight Diner around the corner again
This little place is a reminder of the old NY style diners
Big menus and great prices and centrally located
Being served by long time waitress Lisa is like being served by Mom!!!
Korean home cooking 24/7 at it's best
If you've been out partying and have a yen for quality Korean food at 3:00am, there's a table waiting for you at Kang Suh Restaurant
The food is just as good at 2:00pm in the afternoon
It's not cheap, but it is very good and not exceptionally expensive
The staff is friendly and food or hot coals are delievered to your table quickly
I brought my mother here once for Mother's Day
I've come a few times on dates and with friends
Their Dak Bul Gui is spicy and tasty, so to is their Sizzling Rice and Seafood
Come hungry but be careful not to order too large an appetizer because it would be a shame to waste their scallion pancakes because you've gotten too full prematurely
Sip your soju slowly and enjoy a quality meal
Table barbeque is only available when 2 or more in your party order it
They have the best and most authentic korean food PERIOD
THe decor is beat up but lat time I checked, if you really appreciate food, youcome for the food, not the decor, ambiance, foo and la la
Real koreans don't care about the 'environ' as long as the food is exceptional
Other Korean places try to make up for it with decor, catering to the americnas, fusioning it up, etc, but if you want Korea, come here
Become a regular, become a part of the family
I've tried many of them several times each - Kum Gang San, Han Bat, Woo Chon, Woo Lae Oak, etc

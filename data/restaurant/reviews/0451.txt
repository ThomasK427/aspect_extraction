Truly authentic and fantastic service -- you just can't beat it!!!
I was shocked
A friend and I, who between us have eaten at some of the best BBQ places in the country -- Memphis, Dallas, the Carolinas, St
Louis, etc
, etc
, have never had worse food
The pulled pork was mushy and absolutely tasteless
The smoked chicken was rubbery and had some flavor
The ribs were bad -- the St
Louis and Babybacks were exactly the same in flavor and appearance -- pink, with a smoke flavor that was actually overdone, dry/rubbery, sprinkled with a BBQ sauce that was bland and disappointingly mild
The fry bread was good, and the Key Lime pie was good, but we could not have been more disappointed with the food
Virgil's (which is good, not exceptional) has better ribs, as does Brother Jimmy's
For the best BBQ in NYC, you have to go to Stick to Your Ribs in Queens
great food, great service, great value I would highly recommend this to anyone
This place had great food! I liked the relaxed atmosphere
The staff was not that knowledgeable about all the food, but I guess that's becuase it is new
They need to teach the waitstaff how to pour a beer as well
It should not have half foam half beer
Back to Business the food was good
Watching a performance, chowing down on great ribs
it makes it hard to decide whether to clap or keep on picking at the ribs! Fun and entertaining!
this place was pretty good
the ribs were very tasty and they had A LOT of meat on them
the best part of the whole meal was the side dish of mac n' cheese
this was the best mac n' cheese i'd ever had
i will definitely go back just for that!
Great bbq meats, drinks, and sides
Only complaint they are presented a little too prettily
I visited Blue Smoke for lunch with a few co-workers
Collectively, we had the organic chicken, baby-back ribs, beef brisket, cornbread and macaroni and cheese
This is not for people looking for down home, sauce all over the place barbeque
The food was excellent in a casually elegant way
The baby back ribs were tender, with a smoky flavor and the cornbread was warm, soft and delicious
The lemonade was very tart, however my coworkers ordered the root beer that was served in a frosted glass and they loved it
Definately a great spot for a casual lunch or dinner
Oh one more thing, our service was great
When our server learned that this was our first time there, they gave us 2 peach plum cobblers with ice cream on top on the house!
I ordered the rib sampler, and while all three varieties were smoky and tasty, none of them compared to the fall off the bone, super juicy, smothered in sauce, baby backs and beef ribs I've had in Atlanta, Harlem (Sylvia's), and various backwoods New England bbq shacks
The ribs are somewhat dry and clean, and perhaps appropriate for upscaled ribs, but personally I prefer a more down and dirty rib experience, that I doubt can be had in the Flat Iron district
I ate the assorted platter here a few weeks ago and thought it was decent when I ate it
But, now I can't seem to get the tastes out of my head
It's weird but it tastes better in memory than when I actually had it
I need to go back soon and see why my mind is playing tricks on me
The sample platter was a good choice because you get the ribs, some kind of pulled meat, really good smoky chicken and a hot beef link
We also got the fried green tomatoes which were okay but too salty and a side of collard greens which were good
I liked the complimentary pickles but thought the slices of white bread was a little ghetto
I had dinner with 5 friends at Blue Smoke last night and was totally impressed with the way the food has developed
We all enjoyed various types of ribs (quite tasty)and the sides were fabulous! We definitely had a great culinary experience; casual and fun
Blood orange margaritas are a taste treat! Service was top-rate and I would go back with kids and clients!
I think not
For food Blue Smoke seems to be trying to figure out whether they are TX or NC BBQ
Brisket was definitely not TX
Go for drinks, but not food it will leave you asking, where's the beef?
I was a bit nervouse given all of the bad reviews, but I have to admit it was quite a pleasant experience
We were promptly seated, the waitress was attentive and curtious, and the food nearly perfect
A crack in my frosted mug for my root beer resulted in profuse apologies, a new mug, and a free bottle of root beer (yeah, it's only $2
75 but it's darned good)
The wings were fantastic, though a bit spicy for regular - I'm not complaining
The ribs were perfectly charred with a great taste of applewood, and the pulled pork was amazing
My only regret was not saving room for the Key Lime Pie
Oh well, next time
People were right about one thing - the barbecue sauce on the table is rather bland - probably the only room for improvement as far as I could tell
I grew up eating real southern BBQ
This is the best BBQ I've had on the East Coast (where the term BBQ incorrecly refers to anything grilled or smothered in BBQ sauce)
However, I cannot stress this enough -- avoid the beef and order the pork! On a scale of 1 to 10 I give the beef a 2 and the pork a 7
Their side dishes need some work
Mac cheese is the best, beans need work and why is potato salad so hard to get right? BBQ sauce is fine although I've had better (why is chipotle so trendy all of a sudden?)
Excellent fried green tomatoes
I tried 3 of the desserts -- all were excellent
The next time I go, I know what to get to satisfy my BBQ craving!
Our reservation: Sat nite 10 pm
We met at the bar
Impressed w/ their wine list, I had a glass of Rioja
For appetizers, I had fresh oysters (mmm) my man had the devilled eggs (gone in 2 secs)
For dinner: babyback ribs
The meat was so tender, the combination of smoked flavor dry rub seasonings were WOW in my mouth
My man a full rack - the best ribs he ever had
The finale, a slice of key lime pie - a nice finish
I'm thinking that b/c Blue Smoke is new has been reviewed by every mag newsie
perhaps it is difficult for them to handle the high demand, perhaps service quality may suffer from time to time
Give them a chance, try not to go during the mad dinner rush
I'm glad other reviewers aren't going back - more for me!
The experience of eating at Blue Smoke is a bit odd for a BBQ restaurant: lots of space between the tables, air conditioning, modern decor - it's quite a beautiful space
Like I said, strange for a BBQ restaurant
Anyway, enough about the ambience
the food is fine, but I really wanted it to be better
I guess I'm rooting for this place - unfortunately there's not much to go on
I love deviled eggs, a BBQ staple - but I'll be damned if serving two eggs (four VERY small halves) qualifies as an appetizer
It's more like an insult
Did I mention they took 30 minutes? The babybacks were a disappointment, which didn't shock me in the least
The service was actually pretty terrible - there seemed to be lots of confusion in that room at all times
I honestly am sorry to say that I won't be back
The bbq was just okay here and I don't know why people flock to this place
Virgil's bbq is better
I had a Lynchburg Lemonade for a drink, for about $9
As an appetizer, we had the fried green tomatoes
These tasted like something out of a college cafeteria
They were breaded and basically tasted like chicken parmesan with tomato sauce
Blah
I had the Texas Brisket

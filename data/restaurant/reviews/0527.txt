The food is always fresh and well prepared
The cheesecake is out of this world
The waiters are very sweet - though not particulary attentive
The restaurant has a good feel
It's relaxed, chic, and comfortable
Visit Ciao for a great dinner, and a great way to decompress after a hard day
Caught our eye as across the street from our dessert mainstay, Cafe Figaro
Has indoor/outdoor seating
Smallish menu, but more than adequate, and not that heavy on sauces which is so typical of italian restaurants
We shared three appetizers, (bruschetta's a good bet) a salad, a pasta dish, a quatro (about 3 glasses?) of red wine and dessert for about $70
00, minus tip
Portions are reasonable, but not overwhelming, and filling on a warm spring evening, but maybe not enough for a cold bitter wind
Everything fresh, with good, solid ingredients and well executed
Service a bit slow, but welcomed when you're lingering
Doesn't seat an awful lot of people, and mostly tables for two, which are *very* small, but overall, a cute place to watch the world go by if you have the right table
The Scene A counter piled high with muffins, scones and the like greets customers as they walk in
To the left is a small counter where solo diners can enjoy a meal; groups head to the right to be seated in the bright, airy dining room
There's lots of blond wood, service is cheery and the general air is friendly
The Food Simple, traditional flavors abound
For breakfast, thick, fluffy brioche French toast, served with maple butter and fresh berries, excels; likewise, a clever sandwich of scrambled eggs and tomato jam in a light, salty buttermilk biscuit
The lunch side of the menu includes a wonderful grilled fresh fish sandwich, served with house-made potato chips, a high-quality grilled burger and a luxurious avocado salad
Dinner focuses on the classics
I took 2 visitors from Brazil and arrived at 12:15 pm last Sunday
First the waitress at the door (a brunette wearing a pair of glasses) looked down at her list and told us that the wait should be about 20 minutes, so we decided to stay
After 45 minutes it was 1 pm so I asked again, this time the answer was about half an hour
My guests started to get quite unhappy because they would only spend 2 days in the city and waiting more than an hour for a brunch is definitely not on their program
After another half an hour, I asked the waitress again and she replied about another 20 minutes from now
We waited another 40 minutes and got seated at 2:10 pm
Total wait: 1 hour 55 minutes(!!!), instead of 20 minutes which we have been told
Sure the food was - as always - very good, but we were quite outrageous about the waitress
If we had known that the wait would be 2 hours, we would have walked around or gone somewhere else
Maybe it is the strategy of Clinton Street Baking Co
to starve their guests until they are very hungry and would find everything tasty
How could the waitress give her guests false information on waiting time while she knows exactly that the wait is usually at least an hour for a Sunday brunch at noon?!! It was unbelievably rude!!!
I honestly wish I could explain in words how absolutely phenomenal the pancakes at Clinton Street Baking Co
are, but alas, such words to serve justice to the pancakes have not yet been introduced to the English language
In any case, the pancakes are wonderfully thick but light, and absolutely fantastic with bananas and walnuts
The maple butter is a great substitute for traditional maple syrup as well
This truly is the PERFECT pancake
You MUST try it! (And their fresh-squeezed orange juice is quite tasty as well) Also, if possible, I highly recommend going during the week, as it is much less crowded than the pandemonium that ensues during the weekend
It IS worth the wait though :)
I highy recommend this place
Besides their awesome freshly baked biscuits please try the country fried chicken with honey dip and cole slaw
I was absolutely impressed
It was the best fried chicken I ever had! I can't wait to go back again
For brunch, their pancakes and French toast are great, but I prefer the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon
If you go for dinner, try the appetizers but don't over order since the portions are often quite generous
For takeout I recommend the berry scones and biscuits (rich but worth it)
Stop whatever you're doing and go directly to Clinton Street
I can not understate how delicious the food is at this establishment
I've recently switched from being predominantly a brunch customer to going mostly for dinners
Their consistency at dinner and surprisingly low tarif has revived my faith in humanity
For the longest time there hasn't been a place that so reliably delivers great food at any meal
My husband laughs every time he asks where I'd like to eat, because he knows the answer already
PS - it may not immediately jump off the page, so I'll recommend that you try the artichoke and goat cheese brulee salad
While my date and I had enjoyed a lovely dinner at Clinton Street Baking Co earlier this winter, our second visit last night proved overwhelmingly disappointing- guaranteeing we will never return
Beware - for diners (such as ourselves) who tend to prefer fish over shellfish , there is only one spring menu fish entree
The menu would lead you to believe there are two: a coriander crusted filet and an entree of fish tacos
But beware, when they're out of the first selection suddenly fish tacos = scallops and shrimp, not a flounder in sight
Plus, the waitress totally ignored our table - never asked how we were doing
Even the blueberry pie couldn't keep us there a minute longer
And BTW- two crab-cakes does not a crab-cake meal make, CSBCR!!
had dinner last night w/ a group of 7 and we didnt wait too long to be seated considering it was a Saturday night
service was so so but I think there were really only to waiters but they were trying their best
I ordered the house green salad and the spicy shrimp w/ cheese grits
I didnt care for the salad much, very plain, only greens, hence green salad
the shrimp was ok but the spicy sauce it was in tasted more like a tangy bbq sauce? the cheese grits were bland
my bf ordered the butcher plate which I thought wasnt too bad but you'd be better off skipping it, probably much better at a tapas place or something
he also ordered the pork chop which was pretty tasty
a friend had the crab cakes and sweet potato fries which I really liked, wish I wouldve ordered that
I went here for Brunch last Sunday after having heard so much about it and also seeing the crowds abound outdoors while passing
The friend joining me insisted all menu items were fantastic and told me Clinton St Bakery was her favorite brunch place
I had the Eggs Benedict - food was tasty and home-made biscuits were absolutely delicious - coffee came in those huge bowl-like cups
Portions are substantial and service is average
You're probably looking at about an hours wait during weekend Brunch hour but if you can wait it's worth the time
Myself and 2 friends showed up around noon on a Sat and didn't sit till 2pm
The food and service were great but the wait was brutal
Just get there early
Great neighborhood place
Would recommend, if possible, going on the weekday to avoid long lines
The pancakes are all good- but go with a big appetite
there is a lot of food
Lunch is good as well
On the weekends add your name to the long list and go grab a bloody mary down the street because the food is well worth the hour long wait you will encounter during peak brunch hours
The southern breakfast includes great cheddar grits and although weird to say some of the best bacon you may have ever had
No self-respecting Clinton St
patron hasnt tried their famous pancakes and biscuits, which are more like an experience than a part of the meal
Couple any item on their breakfast menu with one of their lethal Mexican coffees and you cant ask for a better start to your day
Drop by on Tuesday nights for half off bottles of wine and sample one of their homemade desserts with ice cream straight from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory
Overall it is hard to make a bad choice no matter what the hour
Well, no secret that a brunch here on Saturday or Sunday will be a long wait - but once you bite into those pancakes, it will have been worth every minute
Service was fine, and although it's a bit loud and crowded, the ambience is quite good
Try the blood orange mimosa, the cafe con leche, and of course those pancakes!!
Yes, the wait is long and ridiculous as times, especially as you watch others gobble down their food
But they make possibly the best pancakes ever and decent french toast
The other foods are OK, but just go and order the blueberry pancakes and you wont be disappointed
yes, we waited 3 hours
we were told 1
5 hour wait
and after that another 20 mins, then another 20 mins, etc

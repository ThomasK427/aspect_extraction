Mark my words
If you are in the mood for quality Tuscan food this is your place
Creative and authentic, Tuscan dishes are prepared to perfection
Family owned, the beaming husband sees to it that his patrons are seated comfortably, while his wife meticulously oversees the cuisine and preparation of each and every meal - and from what I hear does most of all of it herself! This is a different type of Italian cuisine - hearty and bold - not to be missed
You can have your cake and eat it in Bay Ridge with Artistic Italian Areos, Traditional Family Style Chianti, and this wholesome Tuscan Heaven at Tuscany Grill
Buon Appetito!
We made a 7:30 reservation for a table of 8
When we arrived (7:30 sharp), the only table that could accommodate that many people was taken, with guests in the middle of their first course
After twenty minutes of waiting, the manager, without even apologizing, lied by saying that since we were late, he gave away our table
After 10 more minutes of waiting, we were called in to be seated, (another lie) because the table was not set up and there was no table to set up
After another 10-15 minutes and no table, we left
In BayRidge Areos is the place to go for Italian
However, it's not the place to go for a cozy, romantic, exquisite Italian meal - that would be Tuscany Grill
The food is amazing, the waitstaff pleasant, the ambiance divine
the wait can be awful
With hardly a bar to wait in, often times they'll tell you, no seats tonight
If you go on a Monday - less crowded - you'll fall in love and remember to make reservations early for the following weekend
Food was very good
Nice varity not seen in too many other restaurants (e
g
fried squash blossoms, etc
) Service was good not great, waiters stood around,didn't ask how everything was
We'd read the good reviews of Chianti, but when my husband and I went, we were disappointed
Although the restaurant was far from crowded (maybe three tables), service was abysmally slow, to the point that we wondered if the server was trying to avoid us
Twice, the wines we wanted (on their wine list) were not available and the wine we got, supposedly a great one, was not
The food was completely forgettable, but the price for this experience was pretty high, to say the least
We will not be back; there are some great Italian restaurants in Bay Ridge, but this isn't one
We went here because we had older Italian-American visitors who aren't adventurous eaters
What a pleasant surprise! Everything we ordered was really good
I had a grilled chicken with vegetables that was fresh and succulent
The veal rollatini and chicken chianti got rave reviews as well
The hot antipasti was plentiful and well served
We ordered one dessert and they thoughtfully presented it for the four of us
Give this place a try
THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC
THE STUFFED FIGS,THE FLOWERS,THE PASTA'S
AND THE DETAIL TO YOUR SATISFACTION IS WORTH IT ALL
I GO WITH A FRIEND DOM AND I AM TREATED LIKE A SPECIAL GUEST EVERY TIME
Best Deli around
Great cold cuts and salads
A little expensive, but the quality is worth it
Greenhouse Cafe consistently offers great food
I've never had anything that was below par
It is a bit pricey for a casual dinner (at least for my pockets) but worth splurging on for a nice dinner
and the wait staff is friendly and ALWAYS accomodating and doting
The seafood salad was yummy as was the filet of sole stuffed with crabmeat
And the restaurant week menu was much more extensive than any other I've visited
Looks like a nice little cafe on the outside, the food is nothing more than pricey diner food, the service was slow and the crowd stuck in the 80's with big hair
This has got to be the best pizza I've ever had here in New York
I would recommend this place to anyone
The grandma pizza is to die for
THIS PLACE TRULY HAS THE GREATEST PIZZA IN ALL OF NEW YORK CITY
I HAVE BROUGHT FRIENDS FROM ALL OVER TO TRY THEIR GRAND-MAMA PIE
IT IS DELICIOUS! FOR PIZZA LOVERS, THIS PLACE HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE, INCLUDING VEGGIE PIZZA
THE RICE BALLS AND CALZONES ARE ALSO SPECTACULAR
FOOD LOVERS MUST REALLY EXPERIENCE THIS PLACE FIRST HAND TO KNOW THE QUALITY OF GREAT PIZZA
The pizza is great
Try the Sophia Loren pie, it is loaded with fresh garlic, tomatoes and fresh mozz
It is a garlic lovers dream
The regular pie is good as well
The best pizza I have had in the Bay Ridge Area
Whether you want a slice of pizza or Chicken Parm
dinner your never disappointed from this family owned establishment
Service, variety and quality of food superior
If you want great italian food, this is your spot
The atmosphere is very cute and cozy, the food is amazing (must try the mozzarella sticks!) and very cheap
Me and my husband had a 4 course meal for $50 total!
We've ordered often from this place over the past couple years, but each time it gets worse and worse
The last pasta I had was oily and bland, with vegetables that obviously came from a bag of frozen, pre-chopped; the pizzas are too heavy and too covered with cheese that slides off the tough crust in flavorless globs
There are so many good Italian restaurants in Bay Ridge, both casual and expensive, but this is by far the worst
I went there with my daughters for a girls nite out
They had the grandma's pizza, and a regular cheese slice while I ate the Buono Gustaio
OMG!! That has got to be the BEST pasta dish I've had in a VERY long time
We now make vesuvios our weekly resturaunt to dine in
We live really close to Vesuvio and have been here for many times, eat-in and take-out
The place is warm and servers are always friendly
Vesuvio is nothing fancy but they do make pizza using the freshest ingredients
Everything else, also, is well made
This is the type of pizza I love
Crisp, crisp crust, juicy cheese and tangy tomato sauce
If you like a lower moisture cheese (i do!) versus the higher moisture cheese they use at places like Grimaldi's, Lombardi's and Patsy's - than you'll like this place
It also has the classic, no frills feel of a real NY/NJ italian pizza joint, but with much tastier pizza than 99
9% of them
Unlike the previous rater, I've never been to Lento's
After reading his/her review, I will have to try it
I love Vesuvio's
they have very good pizza, one of the best, if not THE best in Brooklyn
A close second would be La Sala's right down the street
Vesuvio's features real Italian pizza made by real Italians listening to real Italian radio
In Manhattan you always find pizza being made by Mexicans, Chinese or Eastern Indians
Nothing against Mexicans, Chinese or Eastern Indians but, Italians make the best pizza for obvious reasons
There is only one pizzeria in Manhattan that comes close to Brooklyn pizza
I was there only once and can't remember the name of the place; it was near Central Park
Anyhow, Vesuvio's is the place to go for pizza
They have a nice thin, crunchy crust, a tastebud loving gravy (sauce), and mouth-watering cheese
You'll love it !
It really does have the best pizza! I grew up around the corner from Elegante, so I was spoiled
Anytime I've gone anywhere else I felt disappointed
The only thing better than sitting there with a fresh slice or square hot out of the oven, is their calzone or maybe it's that they deliver! Now my kids are spoiled too! (My kids favorite is their spinach roll)
There's been a long debate LB or Elegante

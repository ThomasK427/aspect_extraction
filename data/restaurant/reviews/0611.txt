first, they mixed up our order
when we politely informed us that we did not, the waiter just assumed we were wrong, and then after checking, sheepishly apologized
that would have been ok, but then when we got the check, he were charged for 3 items we did not order
the waiter and the manager were incredibly rude to all of us, including my son, who began to cry
eventually everthing was sorted out, but no apology on their part
it was a tuesday night, so the restaurant wasn't even that busy
what a letdown!
I've only had the pizza here so I can't comment on the other food
I've tried it a couple of times and ordered take out as well
In general, the pizza is pretty bad, the Margherita in particular
Skimpy on the toppings, and if you order takeout it is so unappetizing
However, the olive oil gelato is fantastic and very addictive
I actually ordered the pizza as an excuse to get the gelato!
It was a very dissapointing experience!  First the music has hard rock! it has even hard to have a conversation!  The services was extremely slow, or food when it finally got in out table was COLD!   It is a shame, because the place is very nice! anyway, i dont think i will go again,
we recently ate at otto for my friend's birthday party
we waited over an hour for a table and the food was dissapointing
the pasta was not al dente, but undercooked
the sauce had the taste and consistancy of tomato juice and the dish lacked flavor
the gelato, however, was incredible
skip dinner and go straight for dessert
so it was my b/f and I around 6 o'clock no resveration
the place really packed yet so we didn't have to wait to be seated
My b/f had linguini, and I had their spaghetti
I was disappointed that my dish was a bit under cooked then his
I believe they have a set standard for al dente, and they cook their pasta for the same amount of time no matter the thickness of the pasta
The plates of pasta are 8-12 bucks for 2-3 ounces
Their menu is cheap when you compare them to other places, and it's worth it to try
between our main dish and one drink a piece it's was 39 w/o tip
Try the linguini if you go to be safe
Their service was great
Although the enticingly fresh prosciutto simply melts in your mouth, the remaining menu items may leave you wanting more
The menu is limited w/ maybe 20 variations of pizza 7-10 pastas along w/ selections for antipasto cheeses (which one should not pass up)
The pizzas are individually sized can be shared as an appetizer prior to your pasta
The clam pizza surprising was served w/ a heap of clams (in the shell no less) dumped on top
Although appalling at first glance, it was quite tasty once we dug in
The linguini w/ mussels had a nice kick - thanks to the saffron
The chocolate and hazelnut gelato was superb
Warning - You may leave hungry! Pasta portions are suprisingly small
Word to Batali - the bread/breadsticks do not work and neither does their cheap packaging
Also, your wait staff could use a course on manners
I lived in Italy for six years - I was quite dissapointed with Otto
The decor was very mass scale-ish with no particular charm
Not romantic!! The pizza was the most awful I've had in NYC, and our salad was bland and with no dressing
I was willing to tolerate mediocre food if the service had been acceptable
Bread was plopped on the table - we had to wait ten minutes for someone to bring some olive oil
We ordered salads but our main course was similarly plopped down on the table while we were still in the middle of our salads
By the time we got to them, they were cold
Once our plates were 75% done, someone would miraculously appear and try to whisk them away
I'm a slow eater and it almost felt like I was begging for them to allow me to finish my meal
At the risk of sounding blasphemous, I'd suggest that the wine list is too extensive
Even as a lover of Italian wines like Barolos, Barbarescos, Brunellos and Super Tuscans; I found the selection to be unwieldly
The pizzas are the traditional small European thin crust with more tomato sauce and less cheese
The proscuitto is good, the peperoni is alright and the quattro formaggi is mediocre at best
The restaurant decor and ambience is nothing special
The large size of it does not give you a feeling of exclusivity or romance
Larger parties would find this a good place to go for dinner
The service was poor all night long
It was practically impossible to get the waitstaff's attention to order another bottle of wine
If you go, do not pass on the homemade grappa after dinner
Mario just keeps on getting better and better
The only downfall to this place is that it is so darn good, everyone knows about it and goes there, which means you have to wait for that table
Thankfully, the wine list is great (and affordable) and the drinks are delicious
The pizzas and pastas are superb and the gelati is always the best way to end the meal
oh
Did i mention the scruptious cheeses????
I was skeptical about trying this place cause I had read and heard mixed things about it but went with a friend on a Sat
night in May and really enjoyed it
I thought the pasta and pizza were great - the asparagus side dish and salad were not as good but still acceptable
And the wine list is incredible and we had a great bottle for $30 and, of course, the gelato was perfection
Staff was very friendly and helpful and I loved loved the atmosphere - I'm in my 20's so like loud, trendy places for a Sat night
Great place for a large bday party or other group outings too!
Overall, the service, dessert and wine were very good! However, the pastas were extremely disappointing
It was overly salty and served with uncooked pasta
We sent it back, and the pasta were further cooked, but more salt were added because water were added
One of my friends quoted They served me pasta with grass
I personally would never go back there, not even for the amazing desserts
fabulous restaurant - great food service! the wine list is SO extensive and the family-style dining makes it fun
definitely a terrific meal had by all :)
Otto is an excellent and affordable way to enjoy Mario Batali's genius while in NYC
Menu options are varied, but the real reason to eat here are the fabulous thin crusted Neopolitan styled pizzas
The clam pie comes with a pile of Manila clams (in the shell) cooked on the pie
The diner is left to remove each clam from shell before eating their pizza but the experience is worth it once you take your first bite
An excellent wine list is featured at Otto along with the friendliest somelier in NYC
A must try after dinner is Mario's olive oil gelati
Eaten here a hundred times and love it
But avoid the back room, it is incredibly loud
Our waiter had to shout at us
The front section with the wood panelled walls is much nicer, and feels more intimate
After reading reviews editors I wasn't sure if the pizza was going to be good - But made reservations
Pizza was terrific- thin,crisp, VERY TASTY crust - Had the Pane frattau-with egg on top - was great! Tried the Pepperoni pizza(salami tasted like chorizo!) Margherita pizza was excellent, just like in Naples! Tried Pasta alla Norma, was fine but suggest adding grated parmagiano and red pepper for flavor
for dessert had olive oil coppetta caramel coppeta - both very good- ask for extra chocolate rosemary sauce for caramel coppetta
overall a great experice, great food, dessert and wine! My only compalint is why no italain beer ???- In a place that is meant to give off an italian train station vibe - they missed the mark on the beer
i was disappointed
but just for a bit Thanks Mario - now fix up Lupa will you!
We really enjoyed this pizza experience
The appetizers were excellent and the pizza, although covered with some not so common toppings, were really, really good! To compliment the meal, Otto has a variety of quality wines
Finishing off the meal with a house-made gelatto is a must
If you love traditional pizza, give this one a try to be daring
You won't be disappointed
Mangia!!!!

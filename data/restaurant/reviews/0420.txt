The food was good
But it's good at lots of other restaurants with better service
The bar looked like fun, but the restaurant didn't exactly seem packed
Not surprising
Dined here late night and had impeccable service and amazingly fresh seafood for a Time Square location
The wine list is one of the best in the city, with vintages that are hard to get anywhere and beautiful surroundings for the dining experience
Additionally the bar upstairs is picturesque and spacious, even though the techno music is horrible
Just went there with family and the ambience is quite nice
I did see a show afterwards so it's location was extremely appreciated
However, considering the prices (avg $25/entree), the food did not meet expectations at all
If you care more about where you eat than what you eat, go
Otherwise, skip it
Blue Fin is ground level Times Square and it has tons of windows which gave me an uneasy too busy times square feeling
It's all too touristy for my taste
The food is not superior, the wait staff not attentive and overall I wouldn't recommend this dining experience
Being a younger person I got lots of attitude from staff- I was entertaining a client there
Never again, I'll stay downtown
Walking around Times Square can leave anyone weary
However, upon entering Blue Fin, one easily becomes relaxed
Blue Fin is composed of 2 levels with high ceilings and a full length wall mural of sand and birds
The decor is decidely artsy chic with a mix of hotel patrons and trendy new yorkers
Overall service was average, entrees were standard to pretty good and desserts and appetizers were great
Prices are decent given the caliber of the restaurant
Great place to have a leisurely meal while soaking in the terrific ambience
The service was horrendous
DO NOT come here before your show
It took my party 2 hrs to get out of there we just barely made our show
The manager came over to apologize but that didn't cut it
When the appetizers came, they forgot one order
When the main course came 1/2 our orders came out lukewarm
Drinks took 20 min
The sushi was just OK (the tuna had no taste, the yellowtail/salmon tasted a little fishy)
The oysters desserts were very good though
But all in all, for the prices you pay here, it is not worth it!
This was a pricey experience
Though sushi was OK, my chilian seabass was not
Appetizers and dessert were the good part
Oysters were good also
Service was not
For better fresher sushi, I would go to Raku or Tomoe downtown
For better chilian seabass, I would go to Pisces
Otherwise, save your hard earn cash and try elsewhere where your $ can go further and you get better quality and service
Stayed at The W checked Citysearch for nearby sushi places
Tho Blue Fin had a bad rating decided to try anyway to see for myself
Should believed the rating to save my $ time even if I am on expense accoutn
The chilian seabass soft shell crabs were not very fresh or good tasting, sushi was Ok very pricey
Desserts very good though
Service was unattentative (maybe because I was a single patron?)
Spent close to $140 including bottle of wine - thought I deserved better attention regardless how much I spent
For superior sushi soft shell crabs fairly decent table wine, go to Raku just down the block
I only spent $80 worth every penny
Their 9
2 citysearch rating is well deserved!
I came in alone Tuesday evening and was sat at the sushi bar
Dining solo, I felt a bit uncomfortable, but my server (Michael?) was charming, and handled my many questions expertly with excellent recommendations for wine and sushi
I was also appreciative of him finding information I needed for my show that evening
The sushi was simply outstanding and the apple tart tatin was incredible! A great experience - I'll definitely return next time I'm in NYC
We did the tourist thing this summer and we dined here upon the recommendation of our hotel concierge
We were blessed with an attentive and patient waitstaff, good seafood, and prompt service that got us to our showing of Nine in plenty of time
The food is pricey, but what else is new in Midtown Manhattan? To top it all off, when I asked the waitress about the wine we'd had, she came back with the label affixed to one of the restaurant's postcards
Like I said, very attentive
The only real negative was the high noise level - hasn't anyone told NYC restaurant designers how they can reduce noise levels with more fabric? Anyway, I'd still recommend this one for the fresh seafood alone
I am a big fan of this restaurant group and I think Blue Fin is my new favorite
Finally tried it this weekend
Our sushi rolls were incredibly fresh and really well flavored
I had the snapper over shrimp risotto
The snapper was well prepared and the risotto was to die for
My only complaint was that the drinks were way over priced
No need for a mixed drink to be $11
Otherwise I thought the prices were comparable and the service great
My girlfriend and I decided to meet here for dinner I know a lot of people talk about how bad this place is but we had a good time
Brendon was our waiter and he was very helpful, it was my first time eating oysters since I have never been been to attracted to the way they look and he even explained me how to eat them
Left him a good tip and thanked him for his help! Later on, we saw him on the subway and he remembered us which is a nice thing
The area sucks since is very touristic so you can see those bermuda wearing overweight people from the middle of nowhere in america hanging by the window looking in but is rather amusing
Overall, the food was good, the place was very nicely decorated and the service was splendid
Give it a try! :-)
Blue Fin is not cheap
Make no mistake the food here can get pricey, but it is good
I had lunch here twice when I stayed at the W Hotel back in November 2002
I had the lobster sandwich and Sushi
They both were excellent! The only issue I had was the the women's bathroom
It was filthy
A restaurant this nice should make more effort to keep the bathroom clean
I was on a first date here, we sat outside which was great because you can smoke ciggs out there, we were not forgotten about and we ordered a salad to share and the kind waitress separated it for us on 2 plates
She came around and helped with the menu
She also poured my bottle of water for me
It was a great experience dining here highly suggest this place
Blue Fin is a decent spot, although the crowd is still a weird blend of city folk and Times Square hotel guests
Appetizers are strong, oysters are the highlight
We ordered another round, they were so fresh
Overall, a good exeperience
Beware
Don't get sucked into the hype
Definitely above average but not worth the money - at all
Reduce the price by 20% - 25% and I'd return happily
Otherwise, Blue Fin won't see me again
Went there prior to matinee
Good variety on the menu and reasonable prices
Had great chowder and softshell crab sandwich
Desserts were the best- highly recommend trio of creme brulees and dark chocolate mousse cake- best double choclolate chip icecream

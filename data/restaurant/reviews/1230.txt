Their Brunch must be good too if it's Sangria included
Three of us ventured to Matador somewhat early on a Monday night
While we were a little unsettled that small place, though intimate, was almost empty, we were definitely happy we stayed
The service was friendly, and the waiter knew the menu enough to make good recommendations
The three of us shared two tapas plates and two entrees, which was almost too much food
The Tortilla Espanola was tasty, but the favorite was the flavor of the brown sugar macadamia crusted salmon
The drinks will push up the tab, but the Caribbean sangria is a twist worth trying, and the mojitos pack a punch
Went here with a group for Cinco de Mayo
Margaritas were half price and extremely strong
It is a family business open only 6 months and staff was personable and attenitve
Delicious food with a lot of tapas to choose from
Great ambiance for the 30 something crowd
Live music on the wknds and sometimes during the week
The chef is from Pamplona and adds a creative twist on traditional Spanish cuisine
A true gem in the West Village!
Matador is great! I have been there for a date as well as brunch and the food is outstanding
It is a family run place so the service is as friendly and warm as you would expect
Prices are reasonable and if you go, don't miss out on the Sangria
There are two kinds, red and white, and it really is some of the best in the city
The Scene Just south of Canal Street, chef and owner Mauro Mafrici and his architect wife, Kimberly, have transformed a cast-iron building into a thoroughly modern dining destination
After passing a small bar area, diners enter a stark white dining room with arching beams, imposing chandeliers and a subtly opulent air
Efficient servers help diners navigate the menu's many intricacies, and an effusive sommelier is quick with suggestions from the lengthy, all-Italian wine list
The Food Mafrici's approach to modern Italian fare may seem gimmicky: The menu lists eight seasonal ingredients, each prepared as an appetizer, pasta and entree
But the high quality and artful presentation of delicate homemade tagliolini, tossed with duck ragu, quail eggs and foie gras, and a savory rabbit-eggplant polpettine help erase any skepticism
Rustic desserts like rice pudding and chocolate-hazelnut cake provide a hearty finish
My girlfriend took me here for my bday last Friday night and after reading some of the previous posts, I don't understand the big deal about this place? Sure, the food was very good and presented well, but those prices!! For two people to be $250 is a lot when we didn't even have a bottle of wine
you think they could atleast take the shell off the shrimp at a place that charges this much! There is also no ambience
Place was very brightly lit
There are plenty of places in NYC that offer the same thing at lower$$$
The food is simply remarkable as is the fiery female master sommelier! Half the menu is comprised of original creations while the other half consists of unique slants on orthodox cuisine such as the single super-sized gnocchi with cinammon


yumm! The servers at this elegent establishment were knowledgable but not stiff
My party was seated promptly which was essential considering the miniscule mini bar at the front
The location leaves a little to be desired as it is 1 block south of Canal St
, but the quality and passion that went into the menu and atmosphere make the trip well worth it
Highest reccomondation all around for this Italian standout
It is only a matter of time before this secret gem is discoverd by the NYC A List
We had the 6 course tasting menu - absolutely divine
The artichoke, risotto, and black bass were out of this world
The room is beautiful and the service is stellar
Mimmo is an absolute doll!
I ate at Lo Scalco two weeks ago and the food was out of this world
From the black truffled risotto (The best I have ever had) to the beautiful and delicious desserts, this restaurant won across the boards
The decor is elegent, the service superb and the food the best in the city
I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone
The food was so good that I am going back tonight
Eating at this restaurant is really an experience
The moment you walk in the door the decor wows you
The swooping circular beams, dark stained floor and candlelit room make a very welcoming entrance
And the service is just as impressive
The waiters are very knowledgable about the dishes and the history of the restaurant
The master sommelier, one of seven women in the world, was also extremely helpful when choosing a wine
The 5 course meal was INcredible
Beginning with the artichoke appetizer all the way to the outrageous peach sorbet, owner and chef Mauro Mafrici has outdone himself with this great asset to Tribeca
Great for dates, business, or friends!
This restaurant is truly one of the best meals in New York City and we have eaten at a great number of restaurants
Without a doubt it is a serious challenger to the top Italian restaurants in New York City
Each dish is carefully prepared and is a tribute to the ingredients being served
The chef is passionate about food
EAT HERE
This is the meal you think about when picturing travelling in Italy
What a treat! My friend has been raving about this new restaurant for months
I absolutely loved everything about it
The food is exceptional
The service is outstanding
I highly recommend the tasting menu
It's like a special surprise for each course
Lo Scalco is one of those places that you enjoy so much, you can't wait to tell others
But then you think, do I really want to share such a find? but I can't keep a secret, so enjoy!
Living in downtown NYC, our exceptional choices are limited
So I am happy to see a really good restuarant open! They call it italian, but it definitely is a artsy italian (No chicken parmigiana here!) Gnocchi (that are more like chinese dumplings) filled w/ veal over cabbage Were insanly good
Dover sole filled ravioli, filet mignon w/ sausage and roasted tomatoes,lamb chop with parmesean crust
Service was very attentive, wine master to help you choose as well! Decor was comforting and different
GO!!!
Went to this restaurant on New Year's eve, and we have a very fab dinner
Very flavorful, nice texture dishes
We like their food very much
The restaurant unfortunately gave us a wrong price infomation when we made reservations, but they admitted their mistake and corrected it as soon as we pointed out
The way they handled this was very professional smooth, and actually was very impressive
As the result, our new year's eve became very unforgettable one
We would definately go back to this restaurant to enjoy the regular menu, which looked very nice, too
Moved into this area 1 year ago let's just say food and good drinks( other than tap beer) are yummy!!! A solid palce to go all around - food is fresh and consistent
If I go with friends, clients co-workers or boyfriend we alwats have a great time
Good for people watching, great atmosphere and awesome martini drinks
Catch it during Happy Hour-fun inside outside!
this place is great for a date and a freind to go get dinner and drinks
the service was average, but the amiance made up for is
candle lite tables always win me over, and the privacey is great
very busy on a friday night
trendy and fun!!
We went to Banc for after work drinks since we read good reviews of this place
It was a nice ambiance unfortunately that was overshadowed by the very rude Friday night female bartender who made us give up our bar stools for her friends
Mind you the place was not packed, and we were drinking/paying customers
This kind of behavior has disgusted us and we will never return
A number of patrons there agree with us
We had a great time at Banc, wonderful Martini's, service, and tapas! Great area of town, wandered in just bar hopping and we wonderfully surprised!
Staff was extremely rude to my husband and myself
Place had a stench to it
Just moved back to Murray Hill after a 5 yr hiatus, banc cafe certainly has brightened up the area, definitely my new local, attentive staff a diverse menu, I met my new girlfriend there and we both love the place, friendliest staff in the area by far

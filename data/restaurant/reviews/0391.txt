Our waiter, even though he was serving dinner, was SO out to lunch
First ordered drinks, he returned saying that they were out of apple mix and mint (apple martini and mojito, come on now
)
When our drinks did return, over 45 minutes into the meal, they truly tasted like bong water
Wondering where the bread was to flush the awful taste away, we were told they ran out of bread, at 8:30PM
No joke
Desserts were pleasent enough, if not trying way to hard on presentation, lacking portions and interest
Top it off, the bill was incorrect
Still want to go? Go for the Brazilian dancing on Thursday
Did not eat here but had drinks and came late on Thursday for the Brazilian music and dance party downstairs
Super cool space with high vaulted ceiling, large red walls and candlelit highlights
Was impressed by the DJ and the drinks were strong but not over the top
just right for a Thursday night in the Lower East Side
Check it out if not for the good crowd but also for the unique downstairs space
i went here recently for my anniv dinner, it was romantic but the service and food was bad
it ruined our dinner
the chef took more time arranging the food beautifully on the plates then making it taste good
and the service was very snobby, always incouraging us to get more expensive things, or just more
our dinners were bland and the combinations made no sense
had a great time at suba the other night with a few friends
the food was really interesting and the design was so unique
and check out the lemonade drink
we will be back!
This is probably the trendiest basement establishment I've ever been to
If you like bare walls, a stream around the room, and brown all over, this is your place
The service was pleasant and music average
The food was only enough for a newborn
The bathroom was unique with airplane faucets and no lock doors
Not easy to find, but has great drinks
Young and fashionable crowd
Eat before you come and you'll be fine
I was at suba last weekend with friends and had such a blast, drinking and listening to some great latin and world music
didn't get to try the food, but will be back to check that out
Cool design too
went to suba with a date and had such a great time! yummy drinks, great space, good food (though the portions were a bit small)
definitely recommend it!
My friends and I had such a great experience at Suba last week
The food was interesting, beuatifully presented and very good
The ambiance was incredible
And the service was much nicer than that at most NY restaurants
Anyone who hasn't been there should definitely check it out, even if it's just for the decor alone
It's quite something to see
The waiters were inexperienced, but they tried
Tried to fill the water glasses without hitting anyone upside the head, but did my husband, twice
Tried to take dessert orders, but stopped midway to ask the bar if they had a particular liquor
Not too horrible, but when the bill comes to over $400 for 6 people, the staff should be more experienced
Every plate was a work of art
Unfortunately, it didn't taste like one
The chicken was super bland
I could have done it myself--and that's saying a lot
The sausage and avocado appetizer was yummy though
Ambience: The room with the moat was interesting; the other, boring
However, it was very hot; no air circulation whatsoever
Suba is a fine place to have a meal in a somewhat unique environment, but don't get your hopes too high
The service was BELOW par at this trendy dark *spot*
Even with revervations placed, my guest and I waited an additional 20 minutes to be seated at our table without apology from the maitre'd
Additionally, any rational NYer would have an aversion to paying $8 for a bottle of gas-less table water, and I am no exception, though at least there was plenty of water to go around, which was not the case for the portions on our plates
Yikes folks
eat something first, lest you and your guest starve
Well, we did have the water fill the void in our bellies, but nothing can remedy the huge chasm in our wallets
Suba's very mixed reviews had me curious
A native NYer, I have seen way too many trendy, poorly conceived spots appear on the landscape
Add Suba to the list
My date and I were seated 20 minutes late for our 8:45 PM Wednesday reservation
We were seated in the non-pool room, a decided dropoff in ambiance from the pool room
The despicable bill-padding strategy of serving $8 bottled water rather than tap was quickly effected before we realized what was happening
The food was OK but very oversalted, and peppery to the point that the food was bludgeoned to death
The waitress's boilerplate explanation of Spanish wines droned on even after we explained we didn't need help choosing a (overpriced) wine
From start to finish, the experience was stressful and unsatisfying
And expensive -- $150 for dinner for two
Pass
Visited recently with a group; great atmosphere! Friend from out of town was very impressed
Roasted chicken was wonderful, as well as the chocolate/avacado dessert
Mojitos were good, although not the best in town
Definitely worth a trip for the moat!
The Scene Blue Grotto injects a jolt of energy into a stretch of Third Avenue whose most conspicuous eateries include a Domino's and a Sassy Sliders
Low ceilings and putty-colored walls loosely spell out the grotto theme, with a sprawling banquette in back that seems expressly made to accommodate a hip-hop entourage
The restaurant sizzles on weekends, especially at the huge bar
The Food Though servers use catchphrases like "progressive Mediterranean" to describe the food, don't expect the culinary risk-taking that implies
In general, the food comes across as muddled, and ranges in quality from good to frustratingly average
The kitchen's strengths are in basic, lounge-restaurant offerings like bacon-wrapped dates, pizzas and pastas; entrees (grilled tuna with cous cous is an exception) are a gamble
Among its neighbors, Blue Grotto is big news; among Manhattan restaurants, it's a much smaller story
Pretty nice place on the upper east side
Although a bit pricy the atmosphere is nice and the wait service is all with a smile
No attitude and the bartender is efficient and sociable
Great for afterwork Happy Hour type place and the appetizers are scrumptious
The food was just ok
I love the flavored Martini's
The happy hour deal is great! It's a nice place to meet up on the Upper East Side
Fun place! Some friends told us try the Sunday brunch, so we did
Six of us went last week and it was great
Food, staff and service were enjoyable
Glad we went and we will be going back
Had brunch here on Marathon Sunday with a large group of friends
very accomodating to our large group
The menu had a lot to choose from
I recommend the eggs and french toast
Some friends had the grilled chicken sandwich and said it was great
Nice jazz band, excellent bloody marys and mimosas! Would definitely go again!
I was so sorry i didn't stop by sooner! The drinks from the drink menu were very well made and reminded me of drinks from the Soho Grand Hotel

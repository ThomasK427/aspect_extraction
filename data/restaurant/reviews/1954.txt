Peking ducks are excellent, but the other foods are just okay
We ordered shark fin soup one time and it is pretty bad
The service and decoration are much better than average of restaurants in Chinatown
The Chinese lady who is a owner is very friendly
Some friends of mine wanted to get some good duck the other day
So we thought why not try Peking Duck House in Chinatown
Well, wrong choice!!! Over the years I have had my share of ducks, and my trip to Peking Duck House was certainly the worst
The skin was overly burnt and the meat was dry, as if someone forgot the duck in a deep fryer
Maybe they gave us a reheated stale duck
We were very disappointed with the food
The service was marginal but that was to be expected
I would not recommend the duck and this establishment to anyone
Best Peking Duck I have had, and some of the best Chinese Food PERIOD! A great place for groups with a great deal
I recommend the scallops
And the hostess is a tasty dish in herself
The food is good, very crowded, loud restaurant in the heart of china town
good for large groups
the peking duck rolls are good !
This restaurant is by far the worst I have ever been to
The food was delivered cold
Yes, delivered and not presented
We had to help make room on the table as our food arrived
There was not much of service, especially considering that there were more staff than customers on the floor
I would think if we had to pay $20 for a dish of 10 shimps, that it would be at least warm
Having been to BeiJing and having had other experiences in Chinese cuisine, I think I can say that our order of Peking Duck was not served properly
It can be only catered to the uneducated
The Peking Duck house on Division Street is by far better, and that's where the Chinese people eat
I had the worst service ever in this restaurant
It wasn't my first time there; I've been there many times before
Their service has deteriorated soo much in a few months
It took FOREVER to order
I tried making eye contact with the maitre'd to get him to take my order
He entirely avoided me altogether
After my friends and I finished dinner, I paid the check with a $5
00 (b/c that's all they deserved), the maitre'd HAD the NERVE to contest my tipping, saying You are SUPPOSED to give 15% tip
I defended my reasons, though I shouldn't have to
HELLO! 15% gratuity is only if you deserve it
The service rendered a less than 10% tip (if any)!!! plus, they tried to place us at the worst possible table: near the kitchen
We went there couple times and always had the same dish: Peking duck as a main dish to share between 2 or 3 people and scallion pancakes as appetizer
The service is always good and the food is excellent
I have been here a couple times after work and both times have been good experiences
The bartenders are great and friendly
It is definitely a no-frills pub with good bar food
I would definitely recommend the reade street ale too!
This place has good food, cheap beer
Always interesting people
Bartenders are nice
We stumbled in here one night just because it was close to our hotel
The service was outstanding, the bartender/server was extremely warm and friendly
The food was served quick and was great
The Reade Street salad was great, and our burgers and fries were good and cooked correctly
The atmosphere is fun and casual, and we really enjoyed this little gem
Reade Street has possibly the best beer in the city, little after taste and it packs a wallop
Plus it is cheap
Greatplace to go with friends to blow off some steam from the work week
Everytime I take a new person there they end up using the bar to impress their friends about what a great hidden bar they have found
The food is good too!
A great place with friendly bartender
Fire place, exposed brick, solid food
The kitchen, which is under new ownership, has improved greatly
Fantastic menu and beer selection
If you can put up with old drunk lawyers sabotaging the juke box, this place delivers more drunk for the buck than anywhere in Tribeca
Low key without being seedy, good beers with sucking up the bucks, good times without warning
Bring your friends as this is no pick up bar
And watch out for women making out in the bathroom when Chris plays live covers on Thursday night
My co-workers and I love the to eat lunch at the Reade Street Pub
The salads are some of the best I've eaten and the cheeseburgers are so juicy and delicious
We find the day staff to be very friendly and accommodating
Well, we visited NYC again for the Memorial Day Holiday
Once again, stopped in here
Afte almost 2 years, have to say, we adore this place! Brought a long two additional guest this time and all four of us LOVED this place
Out of every place we ate, this was our favorite
Thanks Delphi! We will be back
You cant get food like this in Ohio
The Scene From the white pillars that line the exterior to the large black-and-white period photos that circle the walls, it's clear that much effort has gone into creating a facsimile of timelessness
The dining room presents a vista of rich leather chairs and banquettes, with great chunks of meat displayed proudly next to the open kitchen and a raw bar tucked in a corner
The adjacent lounge features a long, shiny bar, exposed-brick walls and a charming elevated nook
The Food There are few surprises on the traditional American menu, but enough refinements to compensate
Starters include a hot, sweet chowder light enough to eat in the summertime, and scalloped potato gratin--a delicious standout
As for the entrees, the sizeable steaks are good; monkfish comes on the bone; and the superb seafood towers (named "Chrysler" and "Empire State") go beyond shrimp and lobster to scallops and snow crab
Four of us went to City Hall last night for dinner
Two of us ordered steak (medium), both came out cooked wrong, another ordered prime rib (medium rare), also cooked wrong, the fourth ordered salmon, that was the only entree that was cooked correctly
When we informed the waiter that the steaks and prime rib were incorrectly cooked they were extremely rude, when the steaks came back out the outside was charred, the inside was still rare as can be
Basically, we had a $400 meal and there was nothing memorable about it except the horrible service and the horrible food
Go to Dylan Prime, don't waste your time or money here
We just went last night and ordered the restaurant week menu
The food was OK, nothing really award-winning
Watermelon Gazpacho soup was tasty
The service was NOT good
Our server treated us like second rate citizen, probably because we ordered the restaurant week
Decor was GREAT and so was the wine
I'd be willing to go back once more to see it when it's not restaurant week
If you're looking for a wine list with a price range that meets anyone's taste and pocket book, City Hall is the place to go
The wine director says they're on their way to becoming an All American wine list so their international selections are well priced so we are going back tomorrow night to take advantage
Oh yeah, the food was stellar and that staff was enjoyable
This is our favorite restaurant to go to in NYC
My girlfriend and I live in midtown but never think twice about making the trek to Tribeca
The food, service and ambiance are truly the best in the city
I can't wait to go again
This restaurant was a wonderful experience and will be on my list of things to do on on future trips to the city

I was a little confused about what to think since the reviews here are both extremely good and extremely bad
I think the restaurant would do much better with better service when you're getting a table
It took like 15 minutes just to talk to the woman who mans the door and then when we asked how long a wait it would be she told us she 'had no idea'
WTF? After waiting about 45 min for a table, we sat down outside and the view is even better than promised
The food was excellent
The cucumber margaritas, guacamole and duck were fantastic
The service was slow and stand-offish, as other reviews stated, and I actually did see an insect at the end of our meal, like one of the other reviews mentioned, but I'd still go back here any day
The view and the food are worth the hassle and insect sighting
Last week, I went to Alma on a date
We could have been seated right away downstairs
But we decided to wait 40 minutes for the roof top
While we waited, we had drinks at the bar
I had an excellent Mojito
The rooftop was worth the wait
The view was great and the atmosphere was romantic
We had a couple of specials
all of which were very tasty
If you want a nice relaxing night out
It is a must
Waited 40 minutes for a table
Waited 1
25 hours for food
Right before food was served, 2+ inch waterbug crawled across my lap from the upholstery in our booth
The waitstaff looked at us like we were crazy because we were alarmed
They watched the waterbug run towards the kitchen after we jumped out of the booth, and didn't bat an eyelash, let alone try to get it
They also didn't offer to comp us even a drink, forget about an apology
They grudgingly let us move to another table (with freestanding chairs)
On top of all that, what food we were able to eat was mediocre
alma is one of the best mexican restaurants in all of nyc
amazing use of spices, ingredients, and just all around flavor
even though this will make me wait in line longer, here's my advice: run
don't walk
go to alma
you won't regret it
and you will put it in your top 5 must-eat-there-before-i-die category
If you want a nice view, take the ferry
For food and drinks, Alma is a total waste of time and money
Food truly was below average at best - tasteless chicken tacquito appetizer, ok guacamole, fajitas were flavorless
Maybe it was great one day long ago, but not now
It's waiting to close down, or be closed down; whichever happens first
Really disappointing, don't believe the hype
No doubt the view is wonderful from the rooftop patio
The drinks are great too
Unfortunately the food is just OK
The servers were prompt and attentive, but the food arrived lukewarm (maybe it was served so quickly because it was pre-cooked and had been sitting out for a while) and was not all that flavorful
The duck came in a bland peanut sauce and the steak fajitas were overdone
Below average food, very rude service, very uncomfortable ambiente, nice view
The view is amazing whether you're on the rooftop or on the second level where it's cool and air-conditioned
I was sitting by the window one night and we could see some random firework
And their guacamole is great
But my favorite has to be the steak fajita
Yum!
This is a wonderful restaurant and very hidden
The roof top view is amazing
The service is quick and very friendly
The food isn't your typical Mexican but that makes it great
Many different choices and very reasonably priced
Overall, a great place!
I previously wrote a fantastic review for this restaurant, but went a couple months ago and it had gone down a lot in quality
The food is still pretty good, but it used to be really delicious and interesting, and now is just above average
Many of the best items on the menu have been removed
The service was always mean, and still is
For the price, it is no longer anything special and not worth the hike from the subway, even for the view
But if I lived very close by, I would still go there
I took my mom here on Mother's Day
It was perfect
Even on an unseasonably cold day, the rooftop patio was comfortable
And, of course, the views are amazing
The chilaquiles con huevos were fanatastic, as was the flourless chocolate cake
I'm willing to eat bad food here just for the view, which is saying something really nice about the view
The food here can occasionaly be good but is most often very disappointing
The salsa is almost inedible
The margaritas, however, numb the tastebuds nicely
Yes, the view from the roof deck is spectacular
The skyline of Manhattan makes for a marvelous backdrop while sampling the best tamales this side of the board
Try the chilaqules that is drips with spicy rancheros sauce
Recommended entrees include the Pato Cachuate (grilled duck breast in a peanut sauce), Chuleta de Puerco Adobo (pan seared pork loin in a roasted tomato sauce with sauteed poblano and ancho chiles) or the Camerones Asado (Shrimp Fajitas with mango salsa, chipolte sauce and pico de gallo)
Everything tasted extremely fresh, and the exotic mix of flavors left my pallet swooning in amazement
This is first rate creative and traditional Mexican fare
It ranks up there with the finest Mexican restaurants in Manhattan and has a killer roof deck to boot
Check it out!
Walked down from Brooklyn Heights along the BQE's service road and through the marine terminal, and suddenly there is a brief oasis of restaurants
Downstairs there is a good bar with a fast, friendly bartender who mashes healthy quantities of sugar into freshly cut lemons or sprigs of mint before putting in the vodka and rum
Upstairs, there is the inside dining room, and the upstairs patio
The views are equally good, as the large windows in the dining room are open with nice views of lower Manhattan through the cranes on the docks
Oh, and the food is great
Best mole in Brooklyn
Beware of the wait, which can be over an hour
Good food but nothing special overall and with Manhattan prices
Wouldn't go back
Alma is worth a visit for its location alone
It is in a romantic and charming part of Carrol Gardens, where brownstone brooklyn meets the industrial and gritty port of New York
The views of the port and lower Manhattan are great, both from the deck and from the large picture windows of the dining room
The food, for the most part, is very decent: crispy and flavourful duck, savory poblano relleno, and classic enchiladas
My ceviche was more like a shrimp cocktail, the spicy sauce overpowered the delicated seafood
And our Sauza Gold margaritas were a tad too sweet
The service was friendly, but slow and a little forgetful
But I will come back
Ate on the deck, which was truly great, worth the wait for the view, considering it's summer
Tho the main dining room is cute, and does have some views

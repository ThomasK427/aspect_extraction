Their buffet allows you to taste so many items, and I've yet to find one that I did not like
Always fresh genrous quantities for a low price
No hassle, no risk excellent sushi!
I love it here -- definitely not Nobu or even Haru, but the sushi is always fresh and is always good
They run a great deal with Japas 55 (the karaoke place upstairs) that always makes for a fun evening!
I just wanted to refute the previous reviewer's comment -- East 53 Teriyaki house is not run by the same management as the East chain
As for East chain in general, it's harmless, cheap and decent fish
Don't take your date if you want to impress but it's good enough for a quick sushi when you don't want to spend a ton of money
This branch of East - now known as East 53rd Teriyaki House is very good for a cheap, quick sushi or teriyaki lunch
While, clearly, not exeptional - the food is good and inexpensive
Why do I get the sinking feeling that the person who raved about this being the BEST Italian restaurant in NYC probably lives in the burbs and thinks Italian food stops at red sauce? Grave disappointment given the prices and quality
Time for Ralph to pack it in
this place was also busted by CBS news for passing pork as veal
Food was served cold
Water glasses and silverware contained previous food particles, not to mention the table cloth
The whole room had an old musty smell and the waiters just wanted to turn the tables over throwing food left and right getting orders jumbled
Recommend going across the street to 2 other restaurants or to your local pizza parlor - going to be a lot cheaper for the same quality of red sauce smothered with cheese
Tonight my family and I visited a fantastic, inexpensive, and a cozy restaurant
The service was awesome
My children ate a large pizza and my husband and I had a chicken fiorentino-delicious!!!!!! :-) It was to die for
The manager Ignacio treated us like his own family
You should also try the new place, Strada 57
I did not like the food
I had to complain but to no avail
Will not return
The food here is solid, the ambience is nice and without pretension
Don't let the semi-dive exterior make you think it is less than great inside
Great little neighborhood place -- the food is good, Italian American food
Very inexpensive, very attentive and friendly waiters
Next to the tasty food, the best part is the atmosphere -- Sinatra soft in the background, lots of people from the neighborhood -- very family-oriented
Great spot
What a great dining experience
the food was a cut above most Italian restaurants
absolutely delicious and prepared with care
very fine
the service was fantastic, waiters were always there but did not hover
AAA+++
This place is not what it seems from the outside
I've wanted to try for so long,it didn't disappoint
The food is inexensive and real good
I hear that they have a great lunch special
Ralph Restaurant does best pasta in town
Their service is great and they even warmed a baby bottle for my child
I would recommend it to anybody
Excellent service (they even helped us with our coats), friendly staff, good food, nice sized portions and good tomato sauce at reasonable prices
The pizza looked great too
Great place for pre-theatre dinnner
we should have known better than to eat here when the man said we can make you eggs benedict but without the hollandaise sauce
but i was very hungry and wanted to make it to folk art museum before it closed
the height of the disappointment was when my friend was served only 10 black beans in her omelette (i'm not kidding - only 10!) and when she asked for more, the waiters had to hold a conference and then send over the head waiter for an omelette inspection before coughing up more beans
this is the worst meal i have ever had in new york city
-- and they only serve champaign by the glass and not the bottle - whoever heard of such a thing?
Food is good, plentiful, and surprisingly imaginative for a small cafe
Breakfast is an especially good deal
The staff is unfailingly pleasant and welcoming and the desserts are killer
What is especially nice is the contrast of Lou's pleasant attitudes and good value with the Hilton Towers' bad attitude and worse service
In the course of a week's stay at the Hilton we dined at Lou's several times and the walk accross the street was more than rewarded
If weather permits it is fun to sit at one of the sidewalk tables and people watch
The Scene One of the best efforts by Adam Tihany, the world-renowned architect who seems to design every other new restaurant in town, Remi remains among the city's most exuberant and timelessly stylish spots
A playful Venetian motif is traced out with soaring murals of canals and arches, and Tihany's masterful use of lighting makes everyone appear ready for a spread in Vogue
The Food Remi's Venetian fare, created by Chef/co-owner Francesco Antonucci, remains as fresh and vibrant as the day the restaurant opened in 1990
You will not find a better seafood risotto anywhere in town: Creamy, perfectly al dente and imbued with lobster stock, baby clams, mussels and scallops
Don't miss a signature dish of tuna-filled ravioli in a light tomato sauce, sprinkled with crispy filaments of deep-fried ginger; ditto for the seductive braised veal shank
For dessert, try citrus panna cotta or the banana tart with almond-honey ice cream
I dined here alone during restaurant week, for lunch
Host was friendly
My meals came out pretty quickly, since there wasn't a huge crowd at 1pm
My salad was pretty good, salmon was excellent, but the vegetables that accompanied it (broccoli and spinach i believe) were very bitter
I had to add salt and lemon to make it decent
Waiters were pretty slow, didnt refill my glass of water until I was about to leave, and I had to ask several times to get the check and the slices of lemon
In the end, I guess it was okay, because my rasberry chocolate mousse cake was great!
This Restaurant is the Best Italian Restaurant in the City!! The Staff is great, the food is better! The Private room is Spectacular
New York, NY July 31/2006 What a wonderful and beautiful experince me and my friend we have spend at Remi
The New York restaurant Week or Prix Fix meal at approx $ 25
00 was a terrific value
The asparagus soup, calf's liver with soft polenta, ravioli filled with artichokes, butter, tomato and parmesan cheese, all was delicious
The hazelnut ice cream, tiramisu and the plate of Biscotti, mamma mia!!! what a great flavor
We will return to remi with many, many friends
Arrivederci a presto Remi!  Dr

If restaurant week menus are supposed to intice you to come back to a place later, then these guys have it all wrong
Ravioli and lasagna with sauces that were bland and uninspired
I've honestly had better out of a can
One of our party ordered appetizers off of the regular menu that were a little better, but generally unimpressive, given this restaurant's high ratings
The service was very good and the ambiance was nice, but neither could make up for the short comings of the kitchen
My husband and I have been to Remi many times and will go back
Most of the times you don't need a reservation but for larger parties it's helpful
They are very helpful with picking wines that go well with your food and will even give you a tasting if they have a bottle open
The prices are reasonable for midtown and the food is always a good choice
Ask to sit in Bennies section, he's great
Beautiful italian food, if you have a deep pocket
Reccomended for the true italian!
Remi is a great place for a business lunch, but it's pretty average on the scale of italian food
A best bet would be to go to Remi To-Go, which offers decent take-out food at lowered prices past 2pm during the workweek
Excellent!! Excellent! We were a table of 6 for restaurant week
the meal was exceptional, and all my guest gretly enjoyed the atmosphere and service
The food was excellent, and the staff was friendly and professional
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone living or visiting NYC
Thank you for being a role-model restaurant
Keep up the exceptional work

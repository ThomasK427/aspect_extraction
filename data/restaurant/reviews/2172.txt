Service was friendly and actually very charming
We even got an extra fortune cookie because he didn't what his first one said
This place is clearly a cut above your run-of-the-mill Chinese places
The room is gorgeous; very simple, pretty place with relaxing background music
The food? Way above average Chinese
Super Crispy Orange Beef and the appetizers and chicken dishes were very good! All in, a relaxing, satisfying restaurant!
We stopped here for lunch on Zagit's recommendation
The food was excellent
Loved the special dumplings and steamed wrapped shrimp
House special prawns and basic Hunan Chicken were all with delicious with just the right amount of spice
It's in a great midtown location, and the decor and wait staff are sharp, but the food itself was not so extraordinary
I found its cuisine taste plain
Elegant and very sophisticated Chinese
Extremely good overall
We particularly recommend the dim sum; we have sought out dim sum in many cities, and this is the Holy Grail
The Scene There's something grand about eating in Grand Central Terminal, as 90 years of Oyster Bar patrons can attest
Just ask the time-pressed commuters who prefer the lunch counters; the smokers and drinkers gravitating toward the saloon; and the tourists and power-lunchers enjoying the twinkling white lights of the arched Guastavino-tiled dining room
The Food The restaurant's strength is in obtaining quality seafood
Start with the immaculate oyster selection and follow with the "cold buffet, smokehouse and raw bar" portions of the menu
Chilled lobster salad is paired wonderfully with a curry tarragon dressing; uniformly pink North Atlantic salmon is just slightly smoked, allowing the true flavor of the fish to come through; and the meat comes right out of plump Florida stone crab claws
Hamachi, however, arrives overcooked and without any seasoning whatsoever, and a soupy, creamy paprika sauce overwhelms the pan roasts
After hearing so much about this place, I was rather disappointed
While Grand Central Station is a wonderfully constructed, architectural wonder I felt somewhat like I was on a picnic
The red and white tablecloths and paper napkins just didn't sit well
The restaurant is quite noisy and the the menu is like reading a novel
Besides the length, 15 items that were noted on a daily updated menu were not even available
The seafood is fresh and good but for the atmosphere - pricey! Don't waste your time on the Creme Brulee
While the oysters, Maryland She-Crab Soup (Tues Thus only), Coquille St
Jacques and Caesar Salad with Jumbo Lump Crabmeat and Jumbo Shrimp are great, the ambiance sucks
I've given up on the dining room and always sit at the counter because I get what I want and quickly since its near the kitchen outlet and the server is always bustling through
In the main dining room, finding your waiter is Hell and aside from when they take your order and bring the bill, you'll rarely see them
I've also had issues with idiot maitre d's who suddenly find my plain, unadorned baseball hat objectionable out of the blue (there are no signs)
Space is like half coffee shop, dive bar and canteen
Very unappealing environment and almost factory like
Service is very curt, almost like the service in most chinatown restaurants, and always busy
Servic is fast
BUT, raw bar is what keeps us coming
They had decent wine as well
Other than raw bar, the menu is not so great
I was very exicted to go here but was extremely disappointed
The staff was among the rudest I've ever encountered
Our waiter was horrible -- he spilled our drinks on the table, dropped a dirty knife onto my lap, never came by once to see how we were doing, never refilled our drinks and was in general quite rude in his demeanor
We also made reservations but were still seated an hour later, so I'm left wondering what the point was to even make the reservation here
The oysters were fabulous, but honestly the cooked food was not that great
Our broiled salmon was good, but the hollandaise sauce was lumpy and cold, the veggies were undercooked and the clam chowder was more like a clam broth
Spend your money somewhere else!
Pay close attention to the editorial review
Stick with the raw bar and cold food and avoid anything cooked
My bigeye tuna was nowhere near as good as a homemade dinner, for example
The service was atrocious
I'll spare you the details, but suffice it to say that we lost our waiter for 45 minutes with nary an apology
Been there quite a few times, because my out-of-towner friends insisted on going
The oysters were good size, but warm(!), the service non-existed, packed, loud
The decor is good, but then you'll have to pay for it
I don't understand how this place can call itself a seafood restaurant
Their fried calamari is worse than Long John Silver, chewy and not cripsy
The tuna is tired
The Maryland crab chowder is the only thing to look forward to (only on Tues Thurs)
I'd say, go there once, go there for a drink and snack
And if you get good food, consider yourself lucky
What a waste! With so many truly great seafood restaurants in this city, it's almost sad that this place stays in business
I am not an oyster fan, so the raw bar portion of this place is lost on me
According to my friend, though, the oysters were the only decent thing about the meal
Both of our entrees (sole for me, bass for him) were obviously made with pre-frozen fish (mushy texture), poorly cooked and poorly presented, not to mention ridiculously overpriced
The ambiance was terrible - loud, crowded, hoards of children, tacky checkered tablecloths, etc
If you want to eat here to say you've seen it, have oysters at the bar, but skip dinner!
The structure of this restaurant is nice to look at but the food was garbage
We started with the calamari which seem liked it had been cooked in motor oil
As a main course I had the salmon hollandaise which interestingly had no hollandaise sauce on it
The salmon and side vegetables were dry and bland
The only time we saw the waiter was when she took our order and brought the bill
The waiter did not take a drink order from us
We would have had a better meal in the grand central food court with the same setting and atmosphere
What an oyster list to choose from! This place can be very loud, try and score a bar seat under the lower ceiling in order to talk normally to your companion, if you are okay with oysters and apps only
I will go back again and again to satisfy my oyster fix!
Don't expect a superb dinner here, but it is a great place to run in and grab a bowl of chowder or some terrific oysters
Have a beer or a glass of wine
Slurp it down, then catch your train
That's what the Oyster Bar is all about, and it does a great job at it
Ask the guys behind the counter to make up a half dozen or dozen of what they recommend then just relax and enjoy
Every visitor to NYC and every NYer should visit the Oyster Bar at least once
It is a classic, the space, with it's combination of grandeur and cheap diner is fascinating and the oysters are fantastic
Simply put, stay away from anything cooked here - it all tastes like it came out of a jar or a microwave box
But do grab a drink in the Saloon and ask the knowledgeable staff about the large daily selection of oysters
Great place for people watching too
the food is just okay - but grand central is a beautiful place to visit and the oyster bar is amazing, the place is really cool
it's worth going for a bowl of chowder
the service was very good - the place gets packed, and it's amazing since it sits a million people
the bar and the counters in the back of the restaurant are really retro and cool to check out
Sadly, I had high expectations
The 1st 2 dishes we ordered they were out of
We were on a wait list, yet they sat couples ahead of the 2 of us
Noisy, crowded--our server took our order and the next time we saw him was the for the bill AND he watched us fill out the slip
Food quality did NOT match price
I was SO disapointed
I think one has to get lucky here - with the quality of food svc being irratic
been here twice, 1st time was great (oysters/clams shrimp entree, chowda)
2nd time disappointing
svc is old world - men who do their job but don't hustle not friendly, a little sloppy it's noisy a tourist spot
SUM IT: try if you must, oysters are their main attraction

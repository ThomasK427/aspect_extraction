Since I do not work down there any longer
I find I avoid all other burger joints till I can have Zaitzeff again
Why ruin my tastebuds on subpar burgers when I can have Zaitzeff? Just try them, you'll be hooked
This place is a must for all the burger lovers out there, try the quarter-puonder with cobe beef and you will be addicted to this place
before trying the burgers at zaitzeff, i pretty much thought a burger is just a burger: every now and then i'd walk by a fast food place and grab one just because i was hungry
now, i find myself actually actively seeking out / craving their burgers :-)) the organic food is fresh beyond compare and i can really enjoy a burger without all the guilty knowledge that eating this type of food is unhealthy
the staff are great and the restaurant is cozy :-))
I'm not a vegetarian but I really loved their veg burgers
My girlfirend who is a vegetarian agreed that these were really great veg burgers
If not into veg burgers, they also have a great kobe beef burgers too!
My husband and I went here last thursday night
Service was gracious and the food was excellent
They had a live latin band playing which added a nice touch to our diner
We thought the entire experience was wonderful
This place is really great
The place is really cute- quaint, white walls, good design and layout
The service is HORRIFIC- it's right near work so I've tried after work a couple of times
Each time it's the same thing - 1/2 an hour for one drink
Yesterday they had numerous bartenders as well as servers and the place wasn't packed and it still took 1/2 an hour to make a martini
The staff is almost incompetent
My friend ordered a glass of wine and a beer and that took 1/2 an hour to get- please note there is almost NO work involved in pouring a glass of wine and getting a beer from the fridge
The food - is not horrible but not authentic
Small plates, ok prices (you can find much better food/price in the west village)  The last time I was there my co-worker and I had a huge fight with the mgr
He's nice but not very helpful and not good at taking constructive criticism
So much good food! So little time! This joint's gonna make me fat
The Ensalda de Camarones is amazing
addictive, even
Their ceviche is different than anyone else's, and better for it
And the beef-stuffed plaintains are sweet on the outside and savory on the inside
I'm a coconut fan, so the Coconut Margarita blew my mind, and for desert I followed it up with a Chocolate Coconut Martini
You can't really go wrong with drink like these
Salud!
If you like to eat good food, do not stop by this restaurant
The latin food is not latin at all, and this is coming from a latina and her party who attended this place! The pre-fix menu is misleading
the entree and appetizers are the same size! Chicharones de pollo are chicken wings? since when
wrong name on the menu! The food took forever to arrive! Its all made from scratch and thats why it takes soo long
? well then hire more chef's
duh
NOT RECOMMENDED
oh and the food is overpriced
Great food, great sevice
A great place to escape NYC
We felt like we had taken a vacation to Cuba
Highly recommended
Ambience, service staff were great
Food is not worth writting about
The happy hour till 7pm is great
Mojito for $5 w/ a sugar cane mint was worth the trip there
I have been reading the reviews and was very shocked to hear that many complaints are due to the long wait
I have been there 3 times and have a reservation for April 7
Yes the food takes a little long to get to the table, but it its always fresh and piping hot! I understand that the food is made to order
It is well worth the wait!! sip on a nice drink, relax and enjoy the atmosphere
The service is average, but the food speaks for itself
whoever is cooking these meals puts a whole lot of work into the taste and the presentation
So if you are in a rush DONT GO!! but if you wanna relax and have good time with frinds
its a MUST that you check this place out!!!
It's cold outside
You slip into a dimly lit corner with your partner
It's a night that starts with mouth watering mojitos and the best sangria ever! You begin with a plate of plantain chips with 2 dips as you let your eyes take in the menu
So many sinful choices
May I reccommend the lobster tacos and the payella? Three or 4 tapas are perfect for 2 people
Then you can share an entree
I love the grilled seafood platter
The desserts are limited but the sweet fried plantains served warm and carmelized should satisfy
This place is amazing! The service may be slow with the water glass refills but you will not leave hungry
just happy and maybe a little tipsy off of the pitcher of sangria!
On Feb 17th, at 12:45pm we went to celebrate a farewell lunch for a high level colleague
At the tail end of waiting for 1 hour we got our appetizers, and the waitress then told us oops sorry, we ran out your item
Then we waited another 40 minutes for the entres, and were told oops we dont have any steak left so 4 of you can re-order
Instead of telling us earlier, she waited till the last possible minute to tell us
Then the manager said, hey we'll give you shrimp instead, which would have taken another hour
We then were charged for the appetizers and drinks, at regular price, not the lesser pre-fix menu price we ordered from
PLEASE SAVE YOUR SELF FROM THIS HORRIBLE PLACE
The food we did eat was way below average, very hard and fishy fritters
These people have no business running a restaurant
I don't think I've ever had a worst service than the one I got in this place
It took at least 1 hour before we started getting our appetizers and even then did not come together
Some of us didnt even get what we ordered
For the main course we waited another hour only to be told that restaurant had ran out food
They would not even bother to apologizing for the unbelievably bad service and went ahead and charged us in full for what we had ordered
Horrible service, horrible attitude by the staff
I was a bit disappointed relative to the hype of the previous citysearch writeups
I mean everyone except one person rated it Excellent or 5stars and the one guy who didn't received a owner's response (something I've never seen elsewhere on this site)
Anyway, restaurant was not bad, food was above par, music was too loud and service was excellent
It is quaint and romantic
The steak choice was great
The wine by the glass was lacking (1/3 full)
In sum, a bit above par
but not so good it's worth traveling to this odd, lonely spot of the city
Although, I do not venture down to the seaport often
this place is worth it
The help was extremely helpful in answering questions i had about the menu
Also, the food was delicious
They have some of the best Sangria outside of Spain
I would def be going back!!!
Be warned-worst dining experience in 7 years in Manhattan
I went to Salud a year ago, since it is located in the Financial District one would assume they could eat in an hour
It took us and hour and half from the time we ordered the food to get it
The waitress was clueless
A man at the table next to us was so mad that he yelled at her and left

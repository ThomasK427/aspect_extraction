Crowded so be ready to wait a bit for a table, even a 2-top
Mary's has great food and a very fun atmosphere
The service was on the sucky side, but who cares after a margarita or two
There is usually a crowd to get in so expect a wait
If you want to bring a date here the lighting is soft without being overtly romantic
Yum Yum
If you're simply looking for a huge plate of cheese-drenched Mexican, this is the place to go
For subtle flavors and decent salsa, keep looking
The crowds are huge
Not sure why
That said, it sure beats Benny's
Really friendly, on-the-ball staff
Try the chilean sea bass steamed in foil stuffed with vegetables and what I think was calamari breading and thai spices, slightly spicy dish, they were out of the actual chilean sea bass the night I went so it was substituted with striped bass, but I must say it was the best Thai dish I've ever had
the restaurant itself was nice and service was friendly as well
I would write the name of the dish but apparently citysearch deems the first word as inappropriate, pretty funny
This little place has the best food at the best price
I highly recommend this place to anyone on a tight budget who also enjoys quality food
I have been eating in this thai mastery for many years
I live in Bermuda and we do not have descent thai food here
My visit to the Big Apple is not complete or satisfying until I have been here and indulged in the marvelous food here
I recommend it highly to any of my traveling friends and insist that they pay a visit here
I have eaten in many thai restaurants in New York but the food here definetly is the best
I really don't care about the ambiance
the food makes up for it
I LOVED this quaint little thai restaurant-- the atmosphere, the service, the FOOOOD, it was just a great experience, and I highly recommend this place to anybody, at least based on the experiences I've had here
I'm not a big fan of Thai food but I did enjoy this place
Good food, many choices
The atmosphere could have been a bit better, but whatever
The only complaint I have is that in our group of four, the waitress decided for herself how much tip we had to pay AFTER we paid
Very rude, but I'd eat there again when she isn't working
The food at this restaurant is terrible -- congealed cheese, basically uncooked french fries, and stomach turning omelets
Its menu listing of Chicken Gordon Blue indicates the attention paid to the cuisine
After a waiter spilled a soda on me, without cleaning it up, offering me a napkin, or apologizing, I tried to send back my awful friench fries
The waitress said she thought I was just having a bad day, apparently not realizing that her restaurant was the cause of it
Highly not recommended
This restaurant is BYOB, very hospitable to large groups, lets you sit around forever after your meal and cheap enough that you can practically just order up one of everything
Translation: it's good for a low-key party
I came to John's with high expectations after reading a review in my hometown newspaper
Unfortunately, my family's experience there left a lot to be desired
We started with an order of baked clams that were perfectly awful - strong, fishy, and rubbery minced clams packed into the shells and camouflaged with bread crumbs
These were so bad that we had to send them back
The owner came over to our table and apologized and agreed with us that the clams were poorly prepared
Without our asking, he prepared and brought over a second plate of clams
He said that he'd prepared these himself, and that we would not be charged for either order
Sadly, these clams were just as bad as the first batch, but we politely ate them
The clams were followed by a very mediocre Veal Parmesan and a pallid Lemon Chicken dish that tasted steamed
The side of pasta was undercoked, undersalted, and served in a puddle of watery tomato sauce
The worst insult came when we were presented with the bill, with the clam charge intact
We did not want to argue, so quickly paid our bill
However, this was a dismal dining experience
I have had FAR better meals at busy restaurants like Carmine's, and I'd urge you to steer clear of this sham of a restaurant
I went to eat here last night with my boyfriend and I must say that this is going in my book as one of my favorites
The food is very tasteful umm umm finger licking good
The only bad part was the dishes and utensils are right in the middle of the room so your candle lit, romantic evening is constantly interrupted with dishes being slammed and bus boys and waiters running to the middle of the floor to freshen up the next table for then next batch of customers
I have been to places where the ambiance is alot better but not the food
If you want a great place to eat for a reasonable price this is your spot
I've been going for several years and have always had a great meal at John's
I recently had the 2-1/2 lb
lobster fra diavolo which was awesome, and my friend had the Tuscan meat sauce (slow-cooked for hours until the meat falls off the bone!) on pappardelle
I always like to start off with a couple of the colossal shrimp (unbelievably huge) and the avocado bruschetta
This place is comfortable no matter if you're a couple or a large group
Portions are large and prices are reasonable - a very good value
And I would definitely recommend saving a little room for the chocolate cheesecake
Yum!
My parents came into town and I took them to John's
First time for me
We couldn't have been happier
Impeccable in all ways
Then John's the place to go
They've been there forever and the food is outstanding
From the ossobuco to mozzarela and everything else inbetween
They cut no corners of quality and flavor
The ambiance is in the front, and the romance/privacy is in the back
If you are looking for fancy decor then go elsewhere
Here is were you get quality, service and a full belly
I was introduced to John's in the late 80's when friends of mine worked there
I can never get down there often enough
Simply put, it is the BEST Pasta Carbonara that I have ever had
Great wine, great atmosphere
One of my favorite restaurants of all time, anywhere
For years, this has been a traditional birthday spot for more than one of my groups of friends
John's reliably always serves up delicious Italian food
The authentic traditional favorites are always great and they do spruce it up a bit with their specials
The service is pretty good and the waitstaff is knowledgable
It is cramped in the back room but I think that's part of the whole experience
I do have one negative thing to say - the last time we went, our tiramisu was more whipped cream than anything - perhaps it was the last piece?? But everything else was so excellent (as usual) that we didn't even think it necessary to point this out
The food is delicious and reasonably priced
There isn't much atmosphere and you will be cramped but the waitstaff was helpful and warm
Definitely a favorite to return again and again
To those who criticize because of no credit cards get over it
That is one way to keep their costs down and your prices down
If you're looking for experimental, this isn't your place
However, if you want down-home yummy italian food, this place rocks
The goat cheese tomato ravioli (a special) was absolutely delicious
I also had the chicken parmagiana and the portion was huge and delicious
Get over the credit cards thing
Lots of great places in NY only take cash
Don't be a dork
My boyfriend and I have been going here for a little over a year now and it's our favorite restaurant
The service is great and the food is awesome! Everything is good but the baked clams and eggplant parmesan are to die for! Also sometimes they have jumbo shrimp in the specials and it is definately worth the $5 a shrimp! They are huge and being a shrimp lover, the best shrimp i've ever had! The servings are huge, so good luck finishing your whole meal! This is REAL Italian cooking! Although you can only pay cash, it's still great because it's so inexpensive! Without alcohol, and an appetizer and two entrees, you have a great meal for around $40! Try it and no other Italian restaurant will be even close to as wonderful as this one!

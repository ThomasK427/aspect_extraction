My wife had the filet and I had the Kansas city (new york cut with bone), and both were delicous
The 22oz Kansas city was cooked perfect and had great flavor, one of my favorite cuts and hard to find
The twice baked potato was flavorful and the broccoli was perfectly cooked
The bbq shrimp w/bacon was marginal
Slightly overpriced, but with in reason still
All in all, a great experience
George the busser really saved the day for our waitress, she should count herself lucky to have such a great assistant
My wife and I, from Houston, and another couple from Conneticut were visiting Manhattan for the weekend and I chose Shula's for dinner because I had heard that it was a good steak house
I can honestly say that we had one of the best meals we have had in years
We have some outstanding steak places in Houston and Shula's in Manhattan would give any of them a run for their money
Our service was excellent and we spent a relaxing, unhurried evening enjoying an excellent meal
Some of the other reviewers mentioned that they didn't appreciate a football on the table
We all thought it was a clever gimmick and entirely appropriate in this restaurant (if you want fast and boring
go to Out***k)
I took my wife and parents to Shula's on 4/8/06 for dinner before a show
It started with a broken english host that myself and other patrions couldn't understand
Then, after waiting several minutes at the table, a broken english bus boy comes over and says, The waiter is very busy and will be over later
We waited 10 minutes to place our order and 20 more minutes to get our drinks
I ordered the lobster and the presentation was horrible
It looked like the chef just took out a plate and tossed it on
No sides were included
So, for $100+ I got just a lobster on a plate
Wine list is also below average
Would definately not recommend
Charging high $ for low quality experience
We recently tried Shula's in the Westin Hotel for dinner
The food was EXTREMELY OVERPRICED for the quality (e
g
, their $16
95 Colossal Shrimp Cocktail consisted of 5 medium-sized shrimp thrown onto a salad plate), and as another reviewer mentioned, we also disliked a football being placed directly on our dinner plates
The atmosphere was a bit pretentious (I suppose this was due to patrons who were paying $500/night to stay at the Westin Hotel), and the menu was limited and uninspired
There are much better (and reasonably-priced) steakhouses to enjoy in NYC
When we sat down, our menu was on a football, which was placed on my plate
My friend and I thought this was very tacky
The service was slow and they did not have a lot of choices for the ala carte potato and veggie
I would probably not go again
We went there 9-09-05 for a birthday lunch
The service was inattentive
It took nearly one hour to get out first course, and we had to ask several times what the status of the main course was
When I got my entree salad, which was $18
75 it came on a small plate and barely had any meat with it
I was very disappointed and will not go back
First off, I am a big dolphins fan
However, as a New Yorker, steak houses are a way of life
Me and my wife went to Shula's for our valentines day dinner
I realize that this isn't romantic, but she knew that I always wanted to go
The food took extra long to come out, and when it did my porterhouse steak (their speciality), was WELL DONE
I asked for MED RARE
Furthermore, at the table next to us, the same exact thing happened to the women's filet
To top it off, as I was leaving, I walked by another woman who asked for MED RARE and got WELL DONE
I wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE in New York
Stick to Lugars, Palm, Homestead, Sparks, Benson's and S W
Even Fins fans should stay away
Sorry Coach
My boss took my co-workers and I here for our company anniversary
The service was great
The best steak I've had in years
The portions are enormous
I was very disappointed since I heard so much about the restaurant
My company was hosting an event at the hotel and I took my clients down to the restaurant for dinner
The service was terrible
We had one waitress for a group of 20
She messed up our orders and messed up the order of our COO twice
He finally gave up on his meal and did not end up eating dinner at Shulas
Everyone's meal did not come out as they specified and the general consensus was that no one approved of their meals
Bad service, bad food, totally overpriced for the quality of that restaurant
Then this is the place to go - very very good foof - even the potato was good
I had the lamb and it was delicious hefty portions
You should experience this now , before the current chef leaves
With the barrage of tourist-focused eateries in the Times Square area, it was great to find Shula's Steak House in the recently opened Westin New York
Not only is it located literally footsteps away from all the shows on Broadway, it's housed in a hotel that is worth a stop to look at in itself! Great food and drinks, and stop by the lobby bar - Bar 10 - before or after some of the best steaks you'll find in the City
Shulas is definitely the perfect choice for great food with a menu that will please everyone in your party
This was one hail mary of a meal - wow! The steak was juicy and tender and the sides were excellent, as well
And for dessert, I went for two and scored huge with the delicious creme brulee
Great job, Don!
Great food- we had the blackened cowboysteak, filet, hashbrowns, creamed spinach, salad and lobster cocktail
All delicious- the lobster cocktail is actually a chilled half lobster so you have to work a little bit but it was all perfect
Service was a little slow which was a bit nerve wracking as we were pre-theater but in the end we walked out with time to spare
I think the cart display may slow the waitstaff down a bit as it is time consuming- it is a nice touch but should perhaps be optional or upon request
Hotel restaurant decor with pics of Don but otherwise lovely
Shula's has finally made it to NYC! Food is outstanding and service is impeccable
A winning combination from the greatest NFL coach of all time
Negatives: Restaurant is difficult to find, buried in the Westin hotel
Pricey
We enjoyed the pre-theater dinner which included a glass of wine
Service is wonderful and the food is prepared expertly
The restaurant is a little hard to find in the Westin Hotel but once you get there it's a great experience
In Short Light-green walls, a distinctive copper bar and small wooden tables and chairs give a fresh, updated feeling to the smallish dining room
The moderately priced menu includes antipasti such as the Sardinian cheese plate with honey
Fennel, artichoke and arugula grace various salads, while pasta dishes range from potato dumpling to penne and black tagliolini
The traditionally prepared suckling pig and braised wild boar are among the entrees
Whilst looking for a nice, cozy, traditional Italian restaurant for my Sicilian-born friend, we stumbled upon Assenzio and were surprisingly delighted
The food was delicious, and the cocktail list impressive
Who would think to make an Absinthe Margarita? We went on a Monday night so the crowd was sparse and quiet
Service was excellent
Will definitely make this a must-go place for all our friends' birthays, including my own!
I love this place
We stumbled on it on our way to Perbacco (which is comparable in many ways)
It was a nice night and the windows were open- the wine was good, the food was delicious
I had the involtini (rolled veal) which was mouthwatering

I really enjoyed my evening
There is a very cool vibe in the restaurant, food was good, and service was great!
I went here expecting a lot, but it really doesn't live up to the hype
I waited 30 mins for a table for 4 that had been reserved in advance
It looked like there was seating downstairs but the incredibly rude manager shrugged us off
The crowd was somewhat eurotrash, painfully wanna-be
The waiter was nice, however we found the food lacking
The decor is beautiful, too bad it's wasted on poor management and average food
Friend's birthday dinner, we're thinking nice ambiance, good drinks and food
I HAD TO WAIT IN LINE TO BE SEATED WITH MY PARTY THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN ASSIGNED A TABLE! The food was AWFUL, rice was UNDERCOOKED
DRINKS, overpriced and it was sooo packed inthere I couldn't breathe
VERY BT! This place has been over!
Since Alex Urena took over the kitchen, the cuisine at Suba has gotten way better
The place was always cool and chic, but now it's one of the best Spanish restaurants in the city
Try the pulpo and the sea bass
Service is also very friendly
Rare to find a place with so little attitude
(be ready for the occasional wait on the weekends though, the place gets very crowded
)
I have been a fan of Alex Urena since his days at Blue Hill and Marseille, which is why I decided to host a business dinner on a Tuesday night at Suba
His food is as impressive as ever, and Suba is the right place for it
Service is knowledgeable and courteous, and the space is unique and beautiful
I would return in a second
I've gone there several times
You can even call me a regular
Suba has great food, draws a great crowd (the non-pretentious, easygoing sort), and makes the banginest mojitos ever! It's about that 12 year old rum, or maybe b/c it's mixed by Nicolas
I went there for my friends birthday,dinner was set for 9pm
We did not get seated till 10pm and had dinner at 10:45pm
The service is horrible and the waiters were not helpful at all
When asking for drinks we had to wait about ten minuted for them
I do not recommend this place to no one and will never go there again even if the whole night was for free
The grotto is cool, but LOUD as hell
My fiance and I could barley talk to each other when we were seated
We chose to move to the back dining room, which was lower in volume
Overall the service and food was good, but they need to do some serious soundproofing
the acoustics downstairs are terrible
I think Suba is a GREAT restaurant with a GREAT grotto complete with mote - but to call it the most romantic dining room in New York is a bit off
The diningroom is just too big, too many things to distract you
It's sexy, yes - but there are CERTAINLY sexier
Anyhoo
service was great - our little party probably shouldn't have been out in public that particular night, but the server dealt with us like a champ
And OH MY GOD the hangar steak was OFF THE HOOK (i would never SAY that, but typing it
fine) and the flourless chocolate cake - equally amazing
Great
Love it
Overpriced drinks - good winelist
Hellooo, if you've been to Spain, you would know what tapas means! Anyway, thank God I don't rely on reviews to check a restaurant out
But anyone who reads this, SUBA is fantastic!!! The ambiance, decor, food, and owner/staff are super
We just came back from our trip to N
Y
with my sister-in-law and husband and five daughters altogether ages 6-10
We took them on Sunday Flamenco night, they were outstanding in accomodating our big family and absolutely no complaints whatsoever! We had a real good night and the food was excellent, our daughters and nieces enjoyed the flamenco! One more thing, it is a bunch of bull, they don't charge a seating fee, nor rush you! Truly recommend it, the grotto is fabulous and owner is courteous and kid friendly!
It was my husband's 30th birthday
I was a little hesitant going to Suba given some of the reivews, but our experience was FABULOUS! When I called to make a reservation, the gentelman was very nice and told me that I could have them make a cake or could bring my own and although in the latter case, there is a cutting charge, he offered to waive it for me
He also guaranteed a table in the grotto
When we arrived, we were seated immediately -- there was a table for two at the grotto, by the water, waiting for us
The service was impecable and food was absolutely amazing! We each had an appetizer, an entree, and desert, and we shared a bottle of amazing red wine
With tax and tip, the dinner came to $160
It is a very special place and I would recommend it to everybody!
3 of us were enjoying drinks in the lounge of Suba one night when the owner asked us to leave our table so that diners waiting for their table downstairs could sit there! Funny how they welcomed our business when the place was empty
I used to like this venue but I will never go back to an establishment where the owner is so rude to his customers
There are too many other great bars restaurants in the area to waste your time here
What??? i usually do not pay much attention to reviews
I like to find out things by myself and decide if it is for me or not
I celebrated my anniversary at Suba and had a great experience
The service was efficient and the food was great
After dinner we moved downstairs, the music was outstanding and yes we payed the 40(which gives you 4 drinks, unlike other places where you pay 20 and 30 and get nothing)and it was absolutely worth it
If you do not like spanish food/ music/people and don't want to pay for the CAKE your bringing to a RESTAURANT I guess you should not go!
Stay home and eat it there!!
My reservation was changed from 4 people to 5 people when I arrived at 8pm
The hostess said it wouldn't be a problem, and it would only take a few minutes before we get seated
We waited by the bar, and ordered drinks
90 minutes later, we were still at the bar with no table
Meanwhile, other parties of 5-6 people were being seated
During the whole 90 minutes ordeal, they kept on assuring me that there will be a table
I finally paid my overpriced bar tab and went to a nearby restaurant and got seated at once
Suba was the worst dining experience I have ever had in NYC
We had reservations for 7 people at 10:15 and didnt get seated until 10:50
Midway through the meal the waiter came over and said we were being charged $40 a head since there were 7 of us, and they never said that when i made the reservation
I had lamb for $24 which consisted of 5 bite size pieces of lamb with no taste to fulfil my appetite
After we were finished with the main course around 11:55pm the waiter came over with our check and said we had to leave or pay an additional $40 a head to stay because there was a private party in the room we were in at midnight
3 days later I found out my friend who split the bill with another person was charged $500 on his credit card instead of $120!!!!
Where shall I begin? I went to Suba for a birthday celebration with 6 friends
We had reservations at 10:15 and were not seated until 10:55 (strike 1)
We were seated in the back room and told we had to pay $40/person because of our group size - this was never told to us when the reservations were made
We were seated in a room where a party was starting at midnite and told we had to pay $40
00/person if we wanted to stay (strike 2)
When we complained to the matre'd he dismissed us by saying he didnt have time for such nonsense
We paid for the bill with cash and the balance on my Visa
Not only did they charge my portion but they made another charge for the ENTIRE bill! (strike 3)Overall, they were rude, the portions were small, and the eurotrash needs to go back home
Cos some of the reviews on this place are terrible !!!  I have been twice - the second time being my birthday last week  Ok - so they took 15 mins to fix a our wobbly table - you could just reseat us - there's plenty of room  But the service is great - our waiter was very attentive - we asked what the dressing was on one of out appetizers - he not only explained exactly what was in it - but brought a dish of it with out entree's - without us having to ask or pay extra - the cocktails are good - could be a little stronger - but overall we enjoyed the fantastic food and great atmosphere  Would definately go again and will checking out there new place ASAP !!
The food was very tasty and beautifully presented and the ambiance was really romantic (a little loud, so maybe more sexy than romantic)
Portions are on the small side, but sufficient--not over-sized like a lot of restaurants, which could be a good or a bad thing--for me it was fine because it meant I had room for dessert! The tuna and lamb were esp
good
Out of the 3 desserts we ordered, the flourless chocolate cake was by far the best, though not outstanding
Drinks were across the gamut--ginger martini was excellent, sangria was not
This is a great restaurant for a date-to-impress if you are on the LES and is a great way to start a fun night out
The architecture itself is enough to warrant a visit, and I have had a few fun nights here just drinking and dancing
I recently went to suba with some friends for dinner and drinks
After waiting for 40 minutes past my reservation time I was seated by a member of the rude staff

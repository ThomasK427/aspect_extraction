Staff is very rude and a kind of odd looking and look out of place in their trendy surroundings
Not just your average burger joint Pop Burger is filled with a young, good-looking crowd
There is a no frills eating area up front and a lounge and pool table in the back
Bite-size burgers are perfect for girls but will leave guys hungry for more
Everything on the limited menu from the burgers to the milk shakes scream old school diner but the bar and decidely cool crowd exudes a certain rock and roll trendiness that your local diner wish it had
Sat night - This place is filled with nothing but kids running around the kitchen
Place is filled with frat sort
students who are out for a night of mayhem
The service was poor due to asking for drinks that took 20 mins to get after ordering
And I like this classic movie but the tackiness of playing Saturday Night Fever on the projected tv screens on the wall
The music was GREAT, just doesn't fit this place at all
I had my birthday at Pop Burger and it was great
You can smoke cigarettes in the Pool area, the food was pricey but good, the drinks were bangin and the music was good
The staff was friendly too
My friends and I were going for a friend's birthday
The bouncer was extremely rude
The place was overcrowded, the drinks were crazy expensive and the place looked like a Burger King
It's supposidly trendy but it was a whole lot of wanna-be trendy people crammed into a bar trying to be cool
There are more interesting, upscale great places to go in the neighborhood
There's no reason to go to Pop Burger when the meatpacking is full of better establishments
The burgers are OK- mostly bun- perhaps they are really good if you are drunk or starved but then what isn't? The onion rings were down right awful
They cook this to order which could imply tasty freshness but really just means a long wait for your fast food
WOW
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MEAT EATER TO ENJOY THIS ONE
THE PORTABELLA MUSHROOM BURGER WAS AMAZING AND THE FRIES ARE REALLY GOOD
MY FRIENDS WHO EAT MEAT WERE RAVING OVER THE BEEF BURGERS TOO
MY CO-WORKERS LOVE THIS JOINT AND SO WILL YOU
The few times I have gotten take out, the staff seems to be extremely rude and impolite to the customers
It's a burger joint, snobbery should be left outside!!
The burgers are great
Two small burgers
Good quality meat and ingredients
Brioche
The food is great especially late night and it is located near good night spots
The others who rated this poorly also rated magnolia bakery poorly
Are you kidding me? This is definitely a place for people who enjoy good food and prefer pure maple syrup to aunt jamima's
Sunday afternoon, the place was practically empty but I still had to wait 5 minutes for someone to take my order, then another 10 minutes for the food to come
Got the Pop burger (nothing special and overly expensive) with onion ring (my onion rings tasted fishy, like they fried it in the same oil as fish and it was really salty)
I could have gotten a better burger from the 99-cent menu at McDonalds
Also, the restaurant was sooo cold, turn the heat on people
We were way downtown and wanted a quick late lunch, instead of looking for a local place I suggested that we cab over to Pop Burger, since I've heard so much about it lately
Unfortunately I was partially disappointed by our experience there
First of all, that afternoon the front room wasmessy, all of the tables had crumbs and spills on them
I had to clean my own table
There were at least 4 people in the kitchen and very few customers that late afternoon, but no one seemed to notice the condition of the front
The burgers had nice buns, but were way overcooked - almost dried out
The fries and the onion rings were delicious
The place has a lot of possiblities, but they have to make some basic adjustments
I will return some day and hopefully revise my review
the last guy left out that if you go inside, its even MORE expensive
$12 for 3 mini burgers
We're talking 3 white castles for the price of a case at white castle
Unfortunately I don't have much good to say about this place, but I will try
I'll start with the burgers taste good
BUT, not that good for what you pay for
For $5 you get two bite sized burgers with patties that are about an inch and a half in diameter and about half an inch
And for an additional $2
75 you can wash down those burgers with a 12oz
can of Pop! Yes, $2
75 for a can of coke or 7-up
Cute place, good idea, but WAY to expensive for what it is
the highly over valued
If you want a good burger and a nice beer mug filled of soda (unless you want beer too), I'd suggest walking the extra quater mile to Corner Bistro
Much better value and much better burgers
infact you'll want to walk that extra distance to lose the weight you just gained
The Scene Thin, curving wood beams cover the ceiling, lending a sense of flowing grace to the cavernous space
The bar is perched high above the dining room; tables near the railing are prime for people-watching
Down a steep set of stairs, a sushi bar hides at one end of a dining room packed with attractive Meatpacking District regulars
Service is a bit haphazard at the front door, but smoother once seated
The Food Sushi and sashimi are made with admirably fresh fish, but Chef Tadashi Ono's Japanese fare is the true draw: silken yellowtail in bright yuzu pepper sauce, dotted with wasabi; thin slices of raw Kobe-style beef adorned with just a bit of mustard sauce; and a play on the traditional sushi roll with chopped eel replacing rice and thin strips of cucumber acting as nori
Among the large plates, sumptuous, silky sake-marinated cod and whole fried sea bass stand out
Whether you are going out on a date with your sweetheart or out for a night with the girls, Matsuri is the way to go
The decor is amazing
The whole interior is dark wood with high ceilings that are complemented by huge paper machete lamps
The cocktails (though more expensive than the food) are great- I recommend the Japanese style mojitos
Every course is so well presented
For dinner I would recommend the steak or lobster- both excellent
After dinner you can stop right next door at HIRO which also has the same type of dcor
There is no cover to get in and there is alright mix of music
Went here recently for dinner and its a very nice japanese place
its not too loud or overtly trendy
the decor is pretty and the space with its high ceilings makes it seem nice and airy, not in the least bit suffocating
the sushi is very fresh and of course plated very nicely
sake was good as well and the service was very attendant to keep those cups full
hahaha
overall a great time and a nice place to eat
plus your right in meatpacking so its got great places to hang afterwards if nextdoor hiro isnt your scene
The space itself is beautiful so if you are looking merely to be in a festive spot, then I would reccomend this restaurant
Aside from the look, the food was terrible
The sushi did not taste fresh, the rolls were bland and the appetizers were also pretty sub par
Not sure why everyone raves about the food
The sake menu is pricey but they have some very nice selections
Overall, I would not reccomend this place
The ambience is stunning and the food is really good, but the portions are RIDICULOUSLY small
then look at the prices, and you will definitely think it's a joke
I have been to many of the best Japanese places in the city, and I have never left hungry like this
We just kept ordering more and more food (both sushi and non-sushi) and it just didn't do the trick
We finally gave up and got snacks elsewhere
We will not be returning
I don't normally like trendy celeb spots but I heard this place had great food to boot, so off we went, my husband and I

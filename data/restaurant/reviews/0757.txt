ignore the reviewer that hated this place - must've been a bad night
I was very excited to eat here and welcomed a new place to the Slope, but they really let me down
Though the mustard theme is subtle and interesting, the service is very slow and poor
My steak was terribly tough and not cooked they way I requested
They served a cold poached pear with a chocolate brownie -- an odd, cold combination
The decor is very plain and seems as much like a diner as a bistro
I feared for my dinner after reading the previous review, so I met some friends for dinner there with caution
But to our delight, it was a lovely dinner
Our evening included delicious steaks, pork and desserts, a colorful and informative, if not demonstrative waitstaff, an interesting crowd (including a notable author and the tallest woman in the world) and great ambiance with candles aglow
We left completely satisfied
My wife and I have dined here on several occaisions, and we can't understand why the place isn't busier
The food really is fantastic, and the prices reasonable
On one occasion, we did have spotty service, but this seems to be the exception and not the rule
Also, the new garden is great
The waitstaff is amateur to the point of frustration
Our waiter didn't know the menu or the ingredients
He took our order and never returned until the meal was over
They didn't want to open another bottle of house wine, and our bill included items we had not ordered
After all this, he even had the nerve to ask about the status of his tip!   Food: Six (6) measly lobster ravoli's for 18 dollars!? This restaurant is not worthy of such arrogance - not for its bulk bought and frozen foods
Dinner came with stale bread, and the fish odor was too much for the nose
If you want real service here ask the bus boy, he is the only one that clearly worked there longer than a day
i had a good meal when they first opened, but recently i had the worst dining experience of my life at this place
the chef must have called in sick
the food was horrible and portions irregular: a large plate of pasta on one hand and 3 ribs of lamb on the other
complaints were shrugged off and service was slow, causing the dinner to go on for over 2 hours
other tables were visibly upset as well
I came here during the week for lunch (a rarity in and of itself) and was very pleased
The lunch menu options are fabulous! The pasta is soooooo fresh tasting, the service is great and the price is very reasonable
If you have time to go here for lunch sometime, I highly suggest you do
Having been to Tuscany on 2 different occaisions, I can honestly say that Porta Toscana comes very close to replicating the fantastic food and dining experience of Italy (certainly closer to any other we've tried in NYC)
We have dined @ Porta on 3 occaisons, and have been very satisfied each time
When they first opened, the menu was a bit pricey for the area
But, I believe that they changed chef's and modified the menu
Now, along with the outstanding food -- prices are very reasonable
Sotto Vocce use to be our favorite Itialian on 7th Ave, but Porta is better
Obviously both blow Tutta Pasta away
This restaurant has a beautiful decor and romantic atmosphere
The food was absolutely delicous
This restaurant will probably be my new favorite in the slope
Having eaten out in Rome dozens upon dozens of times, I can say with authority that this new Italian spot in Park Slope has all of the feel, authenticity, and most importantly the flavor of a roman restaraunt, and then some
Simply decorated, Toscana offers inventive variations on traditional (True!) Italian fare
A fantastic wine list and attentive service finish off a great dinner experience
Best hot dogs in the tri-state area
Guaranteed! I've tried them all
Go in there and order a dog, cb, and fry well-done, using that exact language, and you'll be a happy man
This place is beyond classic--the phone number listed is a pay phone (the only phone they have) and the conversation is dominated by Soprano's-esque local softball league talk
Everything's greasy in there in a great way! Tell them Mike Contento sent you
Evenings at the Red Parrot are almost always a good time
Nice crowd and good music whether you go on a Wednesday for their spanish music or on a Sunday for their house
Great for a business lunch and quiet for a romantic dinner
Constantly changing menu with an Italian focus
One of the few places in Elizabeth with a true top shelf selection of alcohol and great wine list
Service is friendly and good looking
Friday and Saturday transform the normally quiet restaurant into a 2 floor club after 11pm
Great crowd with a laid back, newly redecorated 2nd floor lounge
Can't miss!
I've been to this restaurant three times and we just love it
The atmosphere is a little take out but the food is really good, the portions are large and the prices can't be beat
Actually, I should qualify this, the ITALIAN specialties are good
If you get yourself an Entertainment book, there are two coupons inside (two for one meals) that makes it an even better value
Imagine two seafood dinners for less than $15, even with drinks and appetizers we didn't spend more than $30
Without a coupon or discount, I still count this as an exceptional value
It's not a bad place to take kids either
Stay away from the Asian food
As the years go by, the food quality of this place slowly seems to fall flat
Once a place where you could get great pizza, you will be sorely dissapointed by the slop that is served to you
The pizza crusts are tough and chewy like old leather and have a wet card board taste
The sauce is flavorless and the cheese is oily
The Italian sausage is dry and looks rather old as well as lacking in flavor
The staff seems not to understand English and just shrug their shoulders when you ask them a question
There are so many better pizzarias in the neighborhood
Best to stay away from this one
Good food and good price
It is hard to combine the two in the Soho area
Try the eggplant parmesan sandwich
Great food! I recently visited Malika for the first time and I had such a good dining experience that I hope that everyone gets a chance to eat at this exclusive Indian restaurant
I ordered the lamb vindaloo for the first time and I was very impressed
Overall, the decor, atmosphere, service was impeccable
Thumbs up for this restaurant conveniently located from the U
N building
We recently visited Malika for the first time, motivated by a coupon
After presenting the coupon, the manager/owner marched to our table and said he would not honor it, noting the busy lunch hour
(The tables were 20% occupied at 12:45pm
) He said it was up to his discretion, although the coupon's fine print mentioned nothing of the sort
He made such a scene that we decided to leave
When my girlfriend tried to pay for our drinks with a credit card, he ranted about not taking cards for orders under $10
then he refused to give her card back to her! When I protested, he said just get out of here and flipped the credit card at me
We have never been so embarassed, and we recommend avoiding Malika
Management is clearly unfriendly to its customers and employees
We fear how this translates to the quality of food/service

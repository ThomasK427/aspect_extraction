I went there with my girlfriend and we ordered different steaks
It was the best steak I ever had in my life
Place is romantic and relaxed
Bill was $180
It's little pricey but overall, its A+
Although the quality of the food was good, I felt that it was simply perpared and bland
Expensive and slightly over-rated
This is really as good as it gets if one wants to have a steak in NYC
Really quiet place and aestethically calmy decorated with dark wood and sombre textiles
Very good wine list but that's not the reason to go there
The steaks are as good as it gets
I haven't had better anywere and I don't think I will
There is no people watching and nothing is really happening but if you want to have a meal with a friend or a business associate this is the place
I can't praise the meat or the kitchen enough - just perfect
Some restaurants have trouble with the heat and the meat don't get crispy enough - that's not the case here
Crispy on the outside, bloody inside! I will always go here for steaks, unless I need to take someone to their favourite spot
Here you get it all
The steak from Frankie Johnnie's was great
I had the filet mignon, my wife had the porterhouse and we chared an order of french fries
A tasty meal at a classy place
My kids came into town to visit adn the whole family went to Frankie Johnnie's for dinner
It was scrumptious
I loved every bit of my porterhouse and my fries
The only problem I had was that I felt like I couldn't move after dinner--it was so filling
Frankie Johnnie's is a classic NYC steakhouse
The food comes in huge portions and is to die for
The atmosphere is so romantic: wood paneling, dim lights, a beautiful fireplace
It was a delightful dinging experience
I will return to Frankie Johnnie's whenever I can
I didn't know what to expect from Frankie and Johnnie's when I made the reservation after my friend told me it was the best steak he had had
I was expecting greatness and Frankie and Johnnie's delivered
I love red meat, I mean really love red meat and their ground filet mignon was unbelievable
There was so much flavor, especially when accompanied by the garlic mashed potatos
I would definately recommend it everyone, even if you aren't a red meat fan, my friend had the pasta and completely cleaned her plate
9/18/04-UPON OUR VISIT TO NY-THE ONE RESERVATION WE MADE PRIOR WAS FOR FRANKIE AND JOHNNY'S
I HAD A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THE PLACE ON ARRIVAL-THE ATMOSPHERE WAS WONDERFUL
I HAD THE FILET MIGNON AND MY OTHER GUESTS HAD THE RIBEYE AND SCAMPI
ALL WERE SERVED PERFECTLY AND TO THE UTMOST DELICACY OF THE PALET
THESE TRULY WERE THE STEAKS WE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR
WE FINISHED UP AND CAME ACROSS THE OWNER MR
PANOPOULOS WHO WAS A GENUINE TREAT TO MEET
WE EXPRESSED OUR GREAT FIND IN HIS RESTAURANT AND HE WAS SO PLEASED-HE THANKED US BY SERVING US A ROUND OF COCKTAILS ON THE HOUSE
BEING FROM LA
WE ENJOYED THE HOSPITATLITY HE SHOWED AND FELT RIGHT AT HOME
NEXT VISIT TO NEW YORK WILL INCLUDE ANOTHER VISIT TO THIS FINE RESTAURANT AND HOPE ANOTHER TREAT FROM THE KIND OWNER
Out of all the steakhouses in New York, my girlfriends and I decided upon Frankie Johnnie's
The wait wasnt terribly long, the atmosphere was good and the food was excellent! I was craving a steak, and this really hit the spot! The wine choices were not bad either
I am from New Jersey and wanted to catch up with some college friends in a convenient place for us all
Defintely making it worth my travel, we all met at this cute restaurant Frankie and Johnnies before seeing a Broadway play
It's located right next to the show we saw, The Boy From Oz
I had a tasty hamburger and fries, which prepped me all up to see the tasty Hugh Jackman!
I had dinner with friends at Frankie Johnnie's last week and had the best steak I ever tasted in my life
I was delicious! And the steak sauce was so good we bought a bottle of it
The Barrymore room is beautiful and includes a gorgeous melting candle that looks like a sculpture
Also, the potatoes au gratin were divine
I urge anyone who wants a declicious piece of steak to go to Frankie Johnnie's
Although great steak is what drew me here, I think this Frankie and Johnnie's is wonderful
From the food, to the gracious host, to the relaxed dining and great service, and the beautiful surroundings, this place has it all
Hey, maybe I shouldn't recommend it too much
too many people will come!
This steakhouse has the best steak I have ever had
I took my whole family there last Tuesday and they loved it too
New York in general has the best food anyway but this is by far the best steak I have ever eaten
I love steak sauce too
This restaurant makes their own so I bought a bottle to take home
Afterwards my family and I walked around the area and I came to the conclusion that this is truly the city that never sleeps or stops to eat!
This past weekend I celebrated my two year anniversary with my boyfriend at Frankie and Johnnie's
I had never heard of it before so I asked my boyfriend how he knew about it
Apparently he had heard from a friend that it is a terrific steakhouse
Well that's all you had to say to my boyfriend: terrific and steak in the same sentence
This was not your typical steakhouse though
Frankie and Johnnie's was incredibly romanitc
We had dinner in the Barrymore Room and to see if the tales were true we ate their steak
It was absolutely superb
I don't want people to be as clueless as I was about Frankie and Johnnie's
I want everyone to know this is a treasure in New York city
It is in the center of everything, has fabulous food, the service could not have been better, it's romantic and charming
Bon apptit!
The double broil cooking process used here gives the steaks the best flavor of any I have ever tasted and I've been eating in New York steak houses for 30 years
We dined here on May 4, 2004
The atmosphere is great- elegant and understated
It is my favorite steakhouse in the city
Service is professional and friendly
The FJ salad I had with my sirloin strip was very good and the Lyonnaise potatoes were very good, too
We can't wait to return
After spending the whole day shopping in Mid-town I came across Frankie and Johnnies
I sank into one of their comfy booths, relaxed, and sipped red wine by candlelight
It was the perfect end to my day
I am not a steak eater - but my husband is - i absolutely love to go to frankie and johnnies - they make the best chicken for me -and my husband thinks it the best steak around! the chopped salad is a must - and ask for grated cheese!!!!
I like to go to Frankie and Johnny's before I go to a show
It's quaint but the food is delicious and the servers are most attentive
I wouldn't recommend for a large group but if it's 2-4 people, it's good
The dining room is not that large
At the recommendation of New York Magazine, I took my girlfriend here on Valentine's Day and we sat in the Barrymore Room near the fireplace
It was our third date
The menu was perfect because it had hearty steaks for me and pasta and fish choices for her
We had a very romantic evening by firelight
All in all it was a very successful dinner and I have Frankie Johnnie's to thank as well as our waiter Paul
I am happy to say that Tina and I will be back again
I organized a large group dinner here for a business outing

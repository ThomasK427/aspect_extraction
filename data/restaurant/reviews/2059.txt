Try the Spicy Tuna Crunch or Salmon Crunch
Great choice with a nice twist
The rainbow roll and Green Dragon are good choices too
Keep in mind, this place has no hard liquor but it does have great sake and beer
If you have tried the other fancy sushi restaurants and are tired of wasting your money then you are ready for Sushi on Hudson
The restaurant is small so expect a minor wait
Order the Spicy Cruncy Tuna or Salmon
The roe is a little too salty but a large cold beer hides the flavor well enough
Wendy, our server, was prompt, friendly and professional
These guys have been in the village for quite some time, and I go a lot
I've always found their food to be yummy fresh and exceptionally good for the price
The dragon roll, spicy tuna roll and softshell crab roll are my favorites!
Let me preface this review by saying that I've had paid a lot of money for pretty bad sushi before
For the price, this sushi was terrific! (especially considering that this place is in NYC)
I ate inside the restaurant, and ordered the sushi freshly prepared
The salmon and tuna sashimi were fresh and tasty
I would definitely come back again!
I sat in front of their storefront grill where they cook their pancakes
It's interesting
egg, noodles, sauce, veggies, etc
The pancake was filling and very tasty
my friend ordered some sushi and it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go here for sushi
A good place to hang out
if you are always in the area or if you are a college student
Some here say it's not worth it for sushi, but it's not all that is offered
There's always a long line of customers anyway, so they can't be doing it all wrong
The Sushi is great and fresh, and it's very cheap (there is a 6 dollar box with 9 pc sushi, a salad, two dumplings and soba noodles) the only problem is that the ambience is more dining hall then resturant
I've always had good sushi here, though I would always order fresh sushi, rather than take one of the pre-packed containers
The honey iced green tea is excellent
In Short A dozen wood tables with crocheted placemats, white wood walls, antique chandeliers and folksy bric-a-brac impart a rustic, farmhouse feel
Unlike the theatrical Brazilian rodizios, where people feed lavishly on an endless parade of grilled meats, Casa offers a limited menu of seasonal soups and entrees
The food consists of garlic-punched specialties from Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro; many of the dishes are earthy and fresh
I'm from Brazil and have been to all Brazilian restaurants in the city
This the most genuine brazilian food in nyc with a very cozy atmosphere
Unlike a churrascaria, it is authentic home cooking
Doesn't get more delicious than this
The caipirinhas and pao de queijo, which are rarely authentic in nyc, are perfect
The picanha, filet mignon, and frango com quiabo entrees are very good
So is the side of beans
All of the desserts are delightful
And the musical selection includes classics you normally dont hear outside Brazil
(By the way, the review below, from avyanakos, is ridiculously pretentious for a very un-pretentious restaurant
The food doesn't meld together as perhaps intended? not distinguishingly brazilian? Please, unless you are a Brazilian chef, cut the boloney)
Stumbled across Casa last night for dinner
The atmosphere was warm and inviting - though we were there at about 10pm on a Monday - I imagine that had it been an hour earlier or a weekend night, the small space would not have been very accommodating
Overall the service wasn't bad
But the food? Really just not impressed
In NYC, notably the competitively posh neighborhood that harbors Casa, it's not often that I leave a meal with only a middling impression
In many of the dishes, flavors dont seem to meld together they way they are perhaps intended
The black bean soup for instance has an overwhelming alcohol undertone to it and the meat dish we tried didnt have any attributes distinguishingly Brazilian
Still though the atmosphere has a compensating romantic air to it, and despite lackluster fare it was an enjoyable evening
We finally found it!, my husband and I thought! We went there last night for dinner in search one more time for a good Brazilian place in Manhattan
Casa is amazing! Everything is simple, yet keeping with the high standards of quality ingredients and wonderfully blended flavors that Brazilian cusine is known for
From the warm homemade rolls to the perfect moqueca to the ending authentic cafezihno
everything was perfect! Good Luck getting a seat!
We enjoyed the place and atmosphere up until the waitress came along with her horrendous attitude
Throughout the entire dinner she made it clear that we were bothering her and stared out the window while taking our order
Due to the hostile staff, in combination with mediocre entrees, I know I will never go back and simply cannot recommend it
the location is great and the restaurant is cute, but it just gets too noisy in there
the appetizers were good but the entrees were terrible - definitely not worth the money
furthermore, service was terrible too, since the two waitresses had an attitude about everything
to top it off, they included 20% gratuity in the bill!!!
Casa is in a beautiful location in the West Village and upon arriving the ambience is fun, loud and vibrant
Unfortunately, the noise level is a bit of an issue if you're not with a large party and the food is so-so (really bland for Brazilian)
The wine list is not very good, but the native drinks are spectacular
A Nice quaint option instead of a churrasacaria! The seafood was great as was the steak (my friend cleaned every bite from her plate
We let the staff know we only had an hour as we were seeing a show nearby and the waiter saw to it we had a delicous and unrushed meal - making it in plenty of time for our show!
This un-pretentious small restaurant is a great place to impress a date
Most people have never even heard of the street its on, let alone the fine food, good service and mildly romantic feel
The food is reliably good and you must try something you have never heard of
Some may find the service a bit relaxed - but that's just how I like it
Polite, informative and not in your face every five minutes to fill the water glass or take your $$
If it was any less expensive, I would eat there every week
Go early in the evening if you want the place to yourself
I wish I had taken the editorial review a bit more seriously
Yes, the caipirinha is amazing, but we found every item we ordered, except the salad, to be bland, lacking flavour, and not tasting very Brazilian at all
On the other hand, we did not order any meat, only fish, so perhaps that has something to do with it? The atmosphere is lovely, and the service seemed Ok enough
For the $ though, this place seemed not so worth it
This is the best Brazilian Restaurant that I've been in NYC, THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS!!! aH
AGUA DE COCO NO COCO, HUM
SHRIMP, AFTER MANY CAIPIRINHAS YOU MEET THE OWNER , which is warm like the country she came from
Very Friendly and helpfull staff, I made reservations for 9: but arrived 20min early and we were promptly seated anyway (party of 2)
Staff was friendly and helpfull
Good place to go if you want a chill place to eat
We were given the check 10 min after eating , but i didn't feel as though we were being rushed (even though it was packed, on valentines day)
The drinks are reeaally strong so be warned and the food was really well prepared but can get heavy (fried foods) and a little salty
Pricing as mentioned above is accurate
There is a small bar if you need to wait for a table
Casa is the best Brazilian Restaurant in the city, besides Plataforma (churrasacaria, just for meat eaters)
The staff is very polite and the owner is always around to make you feel at home
I am a Brazilian and goes there to drink caipirinha, eat coxinha, brigadeiro
It's the best!!!!!
I lived in Brazil for two years in the eighties and I've always been disappointed by the imitators of its fine culinary tradition
The typical churrascuria butchers (literally) the Brazilian rotisserie concept
Casa explores the real home-cooking side of brazilian food - excellent treatment of collards, delicious farofa, fried yuca, along with some flavors that are hard to find in the US
including Salvador's oil of dende - a fragrant and pungent palm oil that is used in minute quantities to flavor food
To my taste
the restaurant is cute and perfect
The Scene An Old-World blend of rusticity and formality sets the scene with exposed beams, stucco walls, mismatched chairs (and coffee cups), and colorful paintings akin to illustrations from children's books
As the warm waitstaff navigates the narrow pathway between two rows of tables, diners find little distraction from their intimate meals

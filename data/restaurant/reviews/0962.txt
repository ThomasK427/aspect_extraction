The FOOD on the other hand needs improvement, but I have no doubt this place will deliver in time as the kitchen matures
The service and demeanor of the staff is top notch
Extremely warm, inviting and care to your every need with a genuine grace all their own! A MUST for everyone to pay this place a visit!!!
Yes the views are spectacular
But calling the restaurant you get a hotel central board that is trained in passe' and embarrassing corporate speak
Why? I don't know
It seems many outsiders just don't get New York (Ducasse? Did we learn nothing?) And the art of fine service and simple communication is a dying art form
The champagnes and white wines are spectacular yet the reds are pitiful
The sommelier was lovely yet the waiter had b
o
The food showed much promise but who cares
Somebody help these guys
We deserve better
NICE ROOM, GREAT VIEW , WITH EVERY SEAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR SITTING BY THE WINDOW
THE WINE LIST WAS EXTENSIVE AND FAIRLY PRICED
I WAS A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED IN THE MENU SELECTIONS, NEEDS MORE ORIGINALITY
WE WERE ALL UNDER-WHELMED WITH THE FOOD
I HAD THE SCALLOP APPETIZER,AND IT WAS BLAND AND UN-FLAVORABLE
I KEPT WAITING FOR THE FLAVORS IN THIS RICH LOOKING SAUCE TO TAKE OVER, BUT THEY DID NOT, THE SCALLOP WAS A LITTLE RUBBERY
THE KOBE BEEF, WAS VERY UN-INSPIRING
THE DUCK CONFIT WAS GREAT ,DUCK LOVERS SHOULD GO THERE FOR THIS DISH
IT WAS BY FAR THE BEST THING WE TRIED ALL NIGHT, THIS BROTHY DISH IS CRAVEABLE
ALL IN ALL, I WOULD TRY ASIATE AGAIN, BUT I THINK I WILL WAIT A COUPLE OF MONTHS TO LET THE KITCHEN MATURE A BIT
THE SERVICE WAS VERY ACCOMODATING
one of the best asian fusion meals i've had in my life
stick with the following dishes and you're in for a treat: fois gras to start, miso cod as a main course, passion fruit souffle to end
enjoy!
In Short This pleasingly designed space, done in bright wood, with a tin ceiling and wraparound plate-glass windows, hosts a hip local clientele who linger over sandwiches, pastries and coffee
The menu ranges from buttermilk waffles to a cheese and fruit platter to oatmeal and granola
There are also several entree-sized salads (Caesar, curried chicken), pressed sandwiches, non-pressed sandwiches with such fillings as roast beef, daily soups and baked goods
I ether order delivery or get take out here a couple of times a week
The daily soups here are wonderful, always seem to be made from good and fresh ingredients
Very nice sandwiches and coffee too
I haven't tried the sweets, but they look really good
Why go to a chain when you have this handy little neighborhood spot?
I love having this gem of a coffeeshop in my neighborhood
The setting is perfect for people watching or surfing the net, the staff is always friendly and whoever loads the iPod has wonderful taste in music
Gets crowded on weekends because of the Tenement Museum crowd, but otherwise, can't complain
How is it that, in 2005, frozen Coffee Cubes are such a rarity? Whatever the reason, Cafe 88 has got it Figured Out
Iced Coffee with frozen coffee for cubes and complimentary doggy treats make this place an oasis in the last peaceful corner of the LES/Chinatown fringe
The food is great, obviosly (grab the yogurt fruit w/honey for a light, satisfying bite) and park it while your four-legged friend finishes his bisquit
88 is a win-win
I love the sandwiches at this place
The ingredients are fresh and the combinations creative
I had this pressed sandwich with ginger, sweet potatoes and turkey a couple of weeks ago that was to die for
Great coffee too and fun staff
Great place to have coffee and light fair
Sandwiches and soups rock
The staff is ultra nice
If you are in the hood you must go!
I read the first review and agree with it completely! It's a great place for AWESOME COFFEE! Food choice is nicely done with a selection of light sandwiches (I've had them cater my office lunches already because the selection is so good and healthy)
And, of course, the coffee is better than any Starbucks
I am going to be a regular at 88
I just happened to stumble upon this little gem while wandering the LES
It is a great cafe with superb coffee (they do latte art!) I had the chicken sandwich which was pressed on the panini grill- that was awesome
The cafe is all windows on the ground floor- so CLEAN and airy
They have a lounge downstairs which is cozy and romantic, and a large communal table which is great for groups
The staff is fun and really very nice
They have a good selection of wine and beer as well
You gotta check this place out
The Scene Surrounded by nondescript eateries of various types, the restaurant has a tough time standing out
Lunchtime draws a decent business crowd, but evenings are quiet, with the neighborhood largely emptying out after work
Too bad, because the attractive bi-level space, with cool mod furniture that looks even better by sexy votive candlelight at night, has potential
The Food Dishes hail from all over Mexico and have broad appeal--you'll find Yucatan enchiladas, Oaxacan pasilla sauce and queso Chihuahua
A simple shrimp seviche with fresh cocktail sauce shines on the lunch menu, while dinner items tend to be more sophisticated, such as turkey "filet mignon" with bacon and a bold mole negro
We were a group of 8 New Yorkers
We all had a fantastic time and an amazing meal!!! The ambience was fun, the service was wonderful and the food was great
We had a number of very picky eaters and there was definitely something for everyone
We are going back again next week and would highly recommend Zona Rosa for groups of friends!!
The reviewer below me wouldn't know good Mexican cuisine if it bit him or her on the
! I've been a regular at Zona Rosa for some time and the thing that keeps me coming back is the consistant quality of food, service, and over-all atmosphere
Some people have no taste, or there is another Zona Rosa out there that people are getting confused with
This is the only one I know of and it is a great place
Keep up the good work!!!
Zona Rosa A great spot if you like to pay Dos Caminos prices for Taco Bell flavor
You will be hard pressed to find authentic Mexican this repulsive south of the border or anywhere for that matter
The only thing more tragic than the food at Zona Rosa are their hideous cocktails
On an expense account I had the liberty of trying just about every one including their margarita which tasted more like lime flavored battery acid
The dcor and ambience were nice but not one course met even my lowest standards
I have never had an opinion this strong for a restaurant I didnt even spend my own money to eat it
Consider yourself warned
We went during our 4th year anniversary, and We were really excited about going to Zona Rosa, but the food wasn't as tasty as we thought
The guacamole was good
However, the entrees were lacking
He ordered the chicken, the sauce was similar to just ordinary barbeque sauce, but he liked the green rice which is guacamole flavored
I had the skirt steak, I ordered medium-cooked, and it was semi-difficult to cut, even with a steak knife, imagine chewing it!  However, the ambience is great, very romantic
Upstairs is REALLY loud, because that's where the bar is at
Sounds fun though
It's a good place to be with friends
If you want a more quiet atmosphere, sit downstairs, that's where I was
Oh, the service was REALLY friendly though, very attentive but not over the top
But, there's many more Mexican restaurants worth trying!
Tiny portions of average food for insane money
and don't forget to add terrible service
I kept hearing a lot of good things about this place, so I went to check it out myself
Suffice it to say, this was one of the best Mexican dinners I've ever had in NYC
Very authentic and tasty
and the drinks for fantastic too
It's not cheap, but very worth it
But don't take my word for it

I find the food to be very dependable
classic pasta bolognese is very hearty, the chicken parm is HUGE and tender, the linguine carbonara may be one of the best I've had, and their appetizers are good as well
Bardolino is a good, reliable spot for comfort food
If you're looking for something more spectacular
go elsewhere!
I'm pretty much ok with all 3 reviews I read about this place, the food is top of the line, no question, the service is a hit or miss, meaning they have excellent waiters and horrible ones too, it is luck of the draw literally
If you had good service there, try to get your waiter's name and request him/her by name the next time
I don't know what's going on there, but lately they STOPED serving wine and won't let you bring your own
A tip: DON'T ask the front person for a reason, you'll probably get agraveted by the atitude
Even after a few bad evenings at Bardolino, I keep coming back
It sits a few blocks from where I live, and I'm lazy, a perfect combiation! The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry
, boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone
Still, I must recommend Bardolino,but go there , because the take out service is slow and you always end up getting something you didn't want
Loved what they did with Bardolino
The place now sits on the corner of 78th 2nd, it is bigger and warmer than the old one next door
We were on a table of 6, and loved the food,the Portugues salmon and the sirloin steak with cream sauce were loved by everyone, the apetizers were a bit too small for he price they charge
Too bad the only thing they moved from the old place was the less then cordial service
Their favorite words: no, can't, won't, sorry
We just went here for our anniversary and were very pleased with everything
The place is small but romatic--the tables are close together, but we never felt cramped
The food and drinks were excellent and a very good deal, esp
for NYC
Our waiter was awesome and the ambience is very nice
I highly recommend!
Congree w/thousand year old egg is, by far, the BEST in chinatown
Admittedly the restaurant is noisy and lacks decor
but the EXCELLENT food overwhelmingly makes up for that
The food there are sastifying
I often go there to eat with my family
Seating is ok even though sometimes there's alot of people
The noodle and rices dishes taste great
If you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out! They are located in the middle of Chinatown! The service is ok but could be better
Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment
They have it all -- great price, food, and service
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each)
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well
This place is always very crowded and popular
Best congee in Chinatown! They even got great roast pork wrapped in rice noodles
Cheap eats at a great price! They have the best combo noodles, rices, and BBQ meats
Theres a good reason why everyone raves about their meats
its the best in chinatown! Love the tupperware, lol
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity
The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is
)
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices
Service is not what you are coming here for
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that's all the service I need
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach
I've been going to Big Wong since I was 5 years old and this place is the quintessential Chinese BBQ meat joint! Packed since I could remember because the food and price can't be beat! Roast Pork, Soy Sauce Chicken, Congee, etc
everything is delicious!
You cant get any cheaper than less than$5 for a delicious soy sauce and barbacue pork rice dish
Great place to get a good fulfilling meal but do not go for ambience or service
It's truly to just satisfy your curiousty of what TRUE chinese take out food is and not your typical American take out stores
Why is this place still in Business? The food is mediocre and the service non existent
My wife and I like to come here for chinese breakfast
They have great congee and fresh chinese crullers
Service is fast and efficient
Very economical
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge)
It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend
It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place
Quick and friendly service
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city
It's somewhere you can eat and be happy
This is a great place to eat if you dont care about decor
Its a loud place
More for a group of friends then a date
You can bring a date, but this place is not to impress a now love one, but just to enjoy good food and laughs
My mom I take it to go eat in our car across the street--the BBQ Pork Rice another favorite, Duck Soy sauce chicken rice! We swap rice boxes w/ each other
definitely the BEST, but
to eat it in the restaurant, i'd rather not!
Befofe I moved to NYC, my big brother told me that I had to go to Big Wong in Chinatown
He said they had the best roast pork on the planet
I think I probably grunted non-committally
A year past
I forgot all about Big Wong
Then one day my big brother shows up in town
He says 'Let's go to Big Wong
Ok, I say
Big Wong
Right: the best roast pork on the planet
We went to Big Wong
I was expecting something totally different; something fancier and more subdued and hidden and quiet
This dump? I said
Yeah, my big brother said
Best roast pork on the planet
So we sat down and ate
And it really was the best roast pork on the planet
Now I go to Big Wong when I'm hungry in Chintown
been eating there since i was 5
that's gotta say something
Roast Duck and Pork are delicious!!! I recommend the Three Treasures
Wonton is also excellent

Romantic ambiance and charming space - this is a great new spot to check out
Perfect lattes, mochas, espressos, smoothies, muffins, specialty drinks, etc
The space is perfect, too! I'd go there more than twice a day, everyday, if I lived closer and had the time
Check it out -- you won't be disappointed!
fantastic bbq
everything is great! esp the ribs, pulled pork and baked beans
wash it down with some Sweet Tea!
This place was awesome, went there for bf's bday this past weekend and everyone had a great time
Overall really nice ambiance, good for large or small group outings or dates
Service was also super hospitable! It is also in the perfect location, close enough to all of the train stops near times square that it is easy to get to, but it is just a few blocks away from all of the times square craziness
This is a fairly new restaurant - opened in the Fall of '05
We've eaten here a lot and for the most part have enjoyed it immensely
The service is very friendly but also tends to be slow - so make sure to tell them if your time is limited
This will sound weird but the menu is both varied and limited - perhaps it needs some focus? The menu could use some expansion but it is reasonably priced for a sit-down meal in Times Square
With a little work, this restaurant could be a classic
This place is still brand-new, yet I've already eaten here more than I have at more Park Slope-area restaurants that have been around for years! Everything I've ordered has been delicious
Come here for the good, solid vegan comfort food
The V-Spot serves dishes more along the lines of those at Kate's Joint than at Angelica Kitchen (i
e
lots of fake meat and sandwiches as opposed to simpler vegetable-based platters and raw-food options) but what it does, it does well
Don't get me wrong, I love Angelica too--but V-Spot's got lots of charm itself
My personal favorites are the spaghetti with meatballs (try the whole-wheat pasta) and any of the incredibly delicious cakes or brownies
I like the nacho appetizer and the specials like the chicken burrito, too, and whenever I've tried one of my dining companion's sandwiches, I've been pleased
Prices are very reasonable
The owner is friendly and helpful, and the rest of the staff is always pleasant
There's a comfortable backyard and the inside of the restaurant is consistently clean
And I like the fact that I'm supporting a new small business in my own neighborhood
Go enjoy!
I loved this place! The vegan dishes were incredible! I couldn't believe there was no meat involved
I am not even a vegan and I must say that their chicken burritos, empanadas, and penne with meat sauce are amazing
I also really liked their patio because you can get a great view of the sunset while still getting that urban feel of Brooklyn
The staff was really cool which made me feel relaxed while enjoying my food
I stopped by to try their eggplant parmesan sandwich and try a slice of cake
I've been an on again off again vegan for years now
I've never been so disappointed in food and service in any New York restaurant, vegan or not
The servers were unprofessional: they forgot to remove the dinner plate before serving desert
When I ordered the sandwich I saw someone leave the restaurant (the owner, I assume) and return 30 seconds later with a shopping bag containing 3 rolls from the nearby bodega on the corner
Half an hour later, the sandwich arrived on my plate, sitting atop two straggly pieces of iceberg lettuce
Lo and behold, there was the cornerstore bread, doused in marinara sauce, with a rubbery piece of soy cheese and a couple slices of eggplant on it
I tried to eat the sandwich with my hands but I had to ask for a fork and knife because the marinara sauce caused the bread to disintegrate into a rosey mush in my hands
The owner came by to ask me why I'd asked for a knife and fork
Because it's impossible to eat this, I said, pointing at the mushwich
He looked troubled and confused
Too much sauce? he asked
It was dismal
I thought that the terrible entree would be eclipsed by a heavenly vegan chocolate desert
For $5, I got a smallish end piece of cake that had been sitting out for some time (half of the cake tasted stale), delivered to my table with a fork precariously stuck in it
I was astonished
I had to get up from my seat to ask a server to remove my dinner plate after he'd brought me the cake and returned to scurrying about the room trying to keep up with the other orders
He apologized, and finally cleared the place
Overall, disappointing
Not worth the $12
Actually, not worth $3
I love the the Rigatoni with meat sauce, the chicken and beef Empanadas and the Tofu Scramble
The V Spot carries tons of Vegan desserts that are to die for!!! Try the Boardwalk Fudge, Strawberry Shortcake and the Chocolate Cheesecake
YUMMMY!!!
Wow, this place is really bad! It's really expensive-and for what? for crappy food and the worst service ever
Decor is nice, but in NYC, it's a dime a dozen
There are infinitely better options in NYC especially at this price point
Do not subject yourself to this place
Plus seating is tight, and you will feel horrible the next day after taking in so much toxic MSG and refined oils
It's only a good place if you're in your late teens/early 20s, and are hanging w/ a group, and all you want to do is drink and not care about the quality of food and service
If you want to check it out, go for a drink at the bar, admire the plexiglass panels, then leave
Food was as good as ever at this groovy new spot
Host Hostess were fabulous and gave us a great table
Service was top notch
Even getting a reservation was a breeze
Not sure what all the turmoil was about but perhaps folks have not tried the original
On the whole, I found it to be the same food without that cafeteria lighting that they have at the 57th street location
Maybe it helps to be a perennial customer but it seemed to me that any kinks encountered by others had be ironed out in time for a great evening
Don't miss the Chicken Satay, Filet, Quail Seaweed
The wine selection was also good reasonable
The waiter suggested the prix fixe for us without prompting - so while pricey, not out of this world
Loved it!
As a regular of some of the best restaurants in NYC, I can honestly say that this isn't one of them
Being a cool place isn't enough for this restaurant whose food looks nothing like the food in the photos
The food is dry, the seafood is terrible and the service is horrendous
Our scallops were not just tough, but were bad and smelled horrendous
Don't tell the waiter that, because they will insist that the slightly bad smell is part of the enjoyment of their place
I've not met anyone who knows food in NYC that loves this place
If you like really ugly dcor (yes, it has black lacquer finishing) and really bad food, you'll have a great time
If you love great food, try nobu down the block
I seriously think the STAFF AT THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE RE-TRAINED
A friend and I went here at about 11pm
they told us the kitchen was closing
when we asked to sit down at the bar for wine only and some appetizers
they said no way
that their bar was only for waiting customers only
meanwhile we saw people who were not waiting for a table drinking it up
when we went to complain to the manager
he had a rude attitude and said the same thing
by the way the kitchen probably wasn't even closing until 12am
Needless to say I will rather go spend $400 on dinner somewhere else wirh better service
I have been to really expensive restaurants and they always accomodate me
(they should if you are willing to spend $400 on dinner) if the owner of this restaurant saw how the staff was acting he would fire ALL of them
By the way the place was almost empty
Maybe it's to do with the service and FOOD
If you like having your plate taken away while in mid-bite, then this is the place for you! Even just-emptied glasses that have barely touched the table are whisked away at a constamt busy rhythm that should be reserved for the kitchen
The crowd of waiters is claustrophobic and you cannot tell who to ask to slow it down
A different waiter asks the same question and even then they did not get it right - insisting we ordered bottled water when we ordered tap

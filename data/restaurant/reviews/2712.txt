Toppings are always a plus
A great reason to leave Manhattan and let all your worries disappear when biting into a slice
Is a must place for New York visitors or inhabitants, nice colors all over the place, relaxed people only enjoying the food, it was worth the wait (long as usual)
The service a little slow, but what could the waiters do with such a crowd??? really one of my best memories of the city and its borroughs
I have been going to Grimaldi's for many years, and in that time have never come across a better slice
In case anyone who lives in Jersey cares, they have a place, by the same name in Hoboken as well
Also, the best calzones in the city
The pizza here is so good that this place only takes cash! My husband and I split a whole pie! The wait is well worth it, but the wait is outside on the sidewalks of Brooklyn
The neighborhood is safe and you get a great view of the brooklyn bridge from the sidewalk
Be prepared for tight seating as well
This is a great place, and was also a great experience
If you are in Manhattan and it's a nice clear day, take a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge
The city is beautiful from this unique perspective
Once on the Brooklyn side, hook back under the bridge and onto Old Fulton Street
That's where you will find the best pizza in NYC
Some people prefer the thick crust stuff, but this is delicious pizza as it was originally intended to be made
Fresh, top-quality ingredients, and a variety of options for toppings
The beer selection is excellent, and Sinatra is always playing
Save room for a cannoli!
This a good place
The setting is nice, right by the waterfront
The restaurant has a cosy, unpretentious atmosphere
The pizza is extremely good
Personally I don't think it's quite the best in the city, but it's extremely good anyway - very fresh, with great cheese
This is the BEST pizza place I've ever been too
The ambience resembles ones in the movies and I love the music
The ingredients are super fresh and great for sharing with a small group
There are two types of pizza: fresh mozzarella pizzas and aged mozzarella pizzas
I am more a fan of the latter, but Grimaldi's has, by far, the best freh mozarella pizza I've ever had
It's worth the line outside
but don't let anyone fool you
The jukebox, unfortunately, plays much more than Frank Sinatra
The food is cheap and good
Who could ask for more
A scenic walk from Manhattan over the historic Brooklyn Bridge
The pizza is baked in a wood burning oven and the flavor is fantastic
Combine your visit to Grimaldi's with a short walk over the Brooklyn Bridge, from Manhattan to Brooklyn
There's also a nice view on downtown Manhattan from this location
Mouth-watering pizza
Delicious tomato sauce
You should try it, at least once in a lifetime
Run, do not walk to Grimaldi's
It is the best pizza in town!
Grimaldi's is the best pizza I have ever had
We approached the building and the block was empty, but once inside the place was full and bustling
The crust was a crispy tan dream come true with those little blackened air bubbles and chewy center
The sauce was fresh, sweet, and had a bit of a garlic kick
Basil, fresh
Cheese, hot and milky
The wine list was perfect for pizza, cheap and acidic
Thanks to some tactful flirting by the girlfriend, we even copped a couple of free desserts
The Best
Any fool that thought John's or especially Three of Cups is better than Grimaldi's obviously knows nothing about pizza
The fresh sliced mozzerella, the sweet roasted peppers, the hint of garlic and oil, are just some of the ingredients that produce the light otherworldly tasty pizza at Grimaldi's
You need just witness the classic wall of celebrities, or the Sinatra playing over the speakers to know you're in an authentic pizza joint
Venture out of your neighborhood, and head for the city's best - in Brooklyn where the best pizza has always been
My very first pizza experience in New York City was @ Grimaldi's
This is the best stuff in the world
On thin, bubbly crust rests the most delicious sauce
Being a basil fanitac, the fresh leaves that come on the pizza pie I ordered were a delight
No other place makes pizza like this!
There's no question that the Best Pizza in all of NY comes from Grimaldi's
If I lived in Brooklyn I would eat it for every meal 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year (for life)
I can't get enough of that perfectly cooked crust and warm feeling that I'm eating the best stuff on earth !!!
i love lombardi's and patsy's but grimaldi's has the indefinable something that makes it the best
never had a bad pizza, the staff has always been friendly, if not overly solicitous, and the only downside is the occasional wait on line outside
Despite all the raves I have had truly miserable pizzas here on several occasions
The last time I went, the pizza had practically no cheese on it at all! The dough was mediocre, the service curt - what were they thinking? I can recommend Lombardi's or John's over this
Of course, if you want truly great pizza you'll need to look in Italy, not in New York
Pizza here is only an approximation of what it should be
Great pizza and atmosphere and perfect after/before a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge
Grimaldi's has the best pizza in the USA
If you think you've had good pizza think again, if you haven't been to Grimaldi's you don't know what good pizza is
It is worth the truip to Brooklyn, so the next time you go into the city be sure to check it out
great sauce and light crust and decent elbow room at tables
Don't even try to argue
There is nothing better in the tri-state area
Get it with olives
It is better than John's (although I still like their pizza too)
Friendly staff but enough with the Sinatra already
The great thing about Grimaldi's is that its affordable when so many things in NYC are not
Its even better when the food is served fast and hot
And, its simply the best pizza I have ever had in my life
There pizza is unique and unbelievably tasty, as a native New Yorker that grew up in the Brooklyn Heights area it is by far my favorite place to get a slice of pizza and dine amongst Frank Sinatra memorabilia!
A Brooklyn institution
No trip to the borough is complete without a trip to Patsy's (oops I mean Grimaldi's)
Fresh ingredients and delicious flavor can't be beat
It's the only pizza that truly makes me happy anymore! And the atmosphere only adds to the appeal!
Nothing beats Grimaldi's in New York!! GREAT PIZZA, that is the only comment needed
Grimaldi's has the best brick oven pizza in New York City
Red and white tablecloths, Frank Sinatra on repeat, and a prime location below the Brooklyn Bridge, Grimaldi's is as good as it gets
The brick oven pizza is thin crust at its best
The service is fast and the pizza is always steaming
Possibly the best pizza in the country
A great coal fired crust provides a backyard BBQ taste
The ingredients are fresh, the sauce tangy and the cheese goopy
A must taste
Minor downsides are the short list of toppings and the price
But believe me, it is worth it!
I wish I could eat here every day

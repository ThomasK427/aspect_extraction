Tiny slices of pie with a dribble of cream topped off the evening
Overall, not much bang for the pretty considerable buck
We were not really in a hurry, the pace of dinning fine, food excellent, my Yak rib eye (pricey, but worth it) seared perfectly and best beef I've had in NYC in a long while
The smoked Elk carpachio and Tuna tar-tar were equally well done raw, but calimari was rubbery and could not hold its batter, the walnut was either a mistake or a nice touch
My main beef (yak) was with the lousy cramped table (we had reservations but enviously eyed a more secluded, spacious four top which was held for chef friends) and the NOISE
No romance when shouting to be heard over a din more like a grade school cafeteria on Wednesday before Thanksgiving
Despite all that, we left a tip large enough for our waitress to approach us with wide-eyed and sincere thanks
As for a return visit, thanks but no
in an area known for its tourist trap cafes - wildflower is like a gift for us new yorkers living in the village
this one lives up to its name eclectic = wildflower
lychee lobster martini to start with - a delicious gazpacho + a piece of heaven in the form of a chilean sea bass
i have been here more than a few times and sampled the sea bass twice - both the times i have been blown away
my wife had the tartar sampler + wahoo filet and a decadent chocolate cake
oh did i mention what a great wine list wildflower has - 15 wines by the glass and bottles ranging from $25-$450
eclectic wining and dining in a cozy homey atmosphere
i would recommend it any day
service is very warm, friendly and efficient as well
the staff is knowledgeable and kind
I visited WildFlower after reading other reviews on citysearch and could not have been more pleased with the experience! This culinary wonder was delicious, inviting, cozy and romantic
The service we experienced was delightful
In addition to the menu being creative, the wine and beer list was more than complimentary to the cuisine
I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!
what a great experience wildflower was for my first date i
awesome food man! great service - totally attentive and non intrusive
great ambience - especially for couples
romantic and cozy
foie gras mousse on toast was great
hawaiian prawns even better
i would highly recommend this place - if you are looking for great food, excellent service and a homey cozy joint - call wildflower
my date can't stop raving about the place
After dining at WildFlower last Sunday, i can honestly say that it is thebest meal i have had in a long time! My husband and i began our evening outside on they're patio with a delicous bottle of wine, when it got chilly the waiter was very thoughtful and invited us to a cozy table inside
It was there that we ordered dinner by starting out with the foie gras mousse which was a wonderful a reccomendation by the waiter
For dinner i had the seabass and my husband had the rib eye
In all, we both were extremely, extremely pleased with our experience and can not remember a meal that we have enjoyed as much as this one
I went there with my girlfriend after reading the reviews on citysearch
The ambience was nice and waiters were very friendly but the food was only average at best
We ordered the $35 price fixed meals
The crab cake was very good, the lobster mac and cheese was oily and kind of bland, the buffalo meatloaf was good and the grilled mahi mahi was very dry
I was very disappointed in the desserts
We ordered the strawberry gelatto (it wasn't gelatto and it tasted like breyer's) and the cheesecake which came in a glass? reminded me of a milk shake and didn't taste good at all
Overall it was a so-so experience and I've been to much better places and spent less money
Overall the ambiance and decor were lovely
Warm and cozy inside
The waiter was extremely friendly and helpful, and suggested a great choice of wine which was exactly what we were looking for
The risotto was phenomenal, but the roast chicken was dried out
My friend has the mac and cheese lobster which was quite bland
His main was the buffalo meatloaf was just ok as well
The apple pudding was delicious, as was the gelatto
my 3rd visit - and just like the first 2 - everything was superb
went there with my girlfriend wednesday night
we always look for quaint cozy places - and in terms of romantic and quaint - wildflower is a sure winner
the menu complements the ambience - eclectic yet without any pretenses
the food was great - blue snapper, tasmanian king salmon sashimi, creme caramel with rose water was worth walking miles for
in every way it has become our favorite place
we will be BACK
we suggest you go too
been here two or three times bnow and has been fantastic every time
Kitchen is very flexible and the service great - the choice of having mains in half portions so that you can try two is great
One of my favouruites in NY!
While visiting the village last week, we came across a rare find - an unpretentious restaurant featuring sophisticated food
We were delighted by wildflower's extensive wine list and wide variety of exotic foods on the menu
We tried te aligator and loved it! The rose water creme brulle was an innovative spin on an old time favorit of mine
I would be happy to reccomend wildflower to anyone who was looking for a cozy interesting place to go
I recently discovered this Village gem and I can't get enough of this menu
The chef's tasting menu priced at $50 is an absolute steal
Granted, I'm a little adventurous when it comes to trying new things, but I've been there twice and haven't had anything that was less than spectacular
Macaroni Cheese with Lobster, Grilled Octopus Salad, Tuna Tartare and a Venison Chop were the menu one day
The next trip was Salmon Tartare, Spicy Soba Noodles and Elk Medallions just to list a few of the dishes
Excellent wine selections
Both trips were Sunday evenings and it was uncrowded and very romantic
wow! just passed by with my girl - had a look at the menu
and we were hooked
fantastic blend of international cuisine
true representation of new york cuisine
a cultural melting pot
our waiter Tom was fantastic
guided us thru the menu and wine selections
noteworthy menu items that we tried - tasting menu 6 courses for $50 with 2 glasses of wine - great value - frog's legs, knuckle sandwich, lobster mac cheese, octopus salad and venison chop - just fantastic
wildflower cappucino was the dessert - delicious
ambience just wonderful - cozy warm romantic
all in all very highly recommended
would go back in a heartbeat
My boyfriend and i were walking down bleecker street and spotted this restaurant that just looked so warm and cozy with so many candles lit - the menu looked just as interesting
The waiter suggested a wonderful wine from spain while we shared the dixie duck quesadilla
The live guitarist and singer was very friendly and we greatly enjoyed our entrees, whole grilled bronzini and filet mignon that was cut with a fork
For dessert we tried the homemade mango cheesecake which hit the spot
We highly recommend wildflower to our friends and cant wait to go back
Everett is about as authentic as you'll find in Brooklyn's ever booming Chinatown
This place is not recommended for your average Chinese American (sweet and sour chicken, poo poo platter) connoisseur, but someone who is willing to taste traditional fukin fried rice, or delicacy dishes like Buddha Jumps Over Wall and Harbor Fish
The decor is about what you'd expect for any local hole-in-the-wall, however, it has a basement that hosts larger groups for Karaoke and there are TVs around the restaurant that broadcast Chinese television
While it caters to a mainly Chinese crowd, the waitresses do speak a little bit of English and provide some of the best service I've received in a while
Kevin the owner, is a great guy and has consistently been greeting all of his customers during each of my visits
went there for a friend's birthday one of my other friend and i went early and sat by the bar which had a spectacular view of the city
food wasn't as expensive as i thought it would be their special appetizer (calamarie / avocado) was great! lemon sole~ yummy!!!~ we had great service
everyone was so welcoming and helpful
I can see how this can be popular with tourists, kind of like in Vegas with their competing all you can eat megabuffets
But this place is in NYC and you kind of think it would have more to offer than just mediocrity
The sushi is bland and the big ticket seafood items like crab legs are always MIA
It's got a huge selection of food, but it's only a good value if you find stuff that's tasty
There was nothing that I wanted to go back for seconds of

The acoustics of the place make it seem like everyone is talking at full volume - it's so loud you could probably discuss classified information inside and the people at the next table won't hear you
Been to Boca Chica twice and loved both experiences
once with a large group and once with a friend
Food is wonderful, as well as the mojitos
Watch out though, they do not play around with the alcohol!!!!
If you've been intimidated by the massive dinner crowds, try Sunday brunch (but, sadly, not open on Saturday morning)
Food is tasty and not too heavy
Love the eggs migas
And brunch cocktails are a measly 2 bucks
Rave-inspiring seafood, spicy specialties and strong drinks in a crowded but amiable atmosphere
Added draw: we saw several Beastie Boys here with Cibo Matto
The Scene Butter-colored walls, fresh flowers and a creamy pressed-tin ceiling add liveliness and warmth to this slender East Village perennial
Couples and banquet-style parties populate the tables, while small groups vie for the window seat strewn with pillows
Weekend brunches draw the varied, stylish neighborhood denizens one would expect; weekday evenings attract a more conservative crowd
The Food Touches of sweetness enhance the rib-sticking menu, in dishes like the pecan-coated catfish with bourbon-maple butter and collard greens, and juicy roast chicken with a preserved lemon-olive sauce
Salt cod croquettes provide a full-bodied opening to the meal, while chocolate souffle finishes with pleasing, gooey comfort
For brunch, go for the fluffy raisin challah French toast or Tex-Mex scrambled eggs with fresh tortillas and a side of crisp pork sausage
Never had a worse experience than this one I had at 9th street market
Waited for 1
5 hours in 39F cold Nov
morning for 5 ppl seats
The food was average, not as good as these reviews say it is
The service is horrible
Extremly unfriendly and rude
Waited for such a long time and they rushed you to finish your meals so they can go on and serve another table of 5
Not recommended at all
I'm somewhat reluctant to rave about this wonderful restaurant
I don't want to let the secret out
9th Street Market is part country inn, part French bistro and part quirky East Village den
The southern inspired food is amazing
The service is friendly, yet professional, and the atmosphere is relaxing and quaint
I wanted to curl up and take a nap in the window seat after my delicious dinner of roasted chicken (which was followed by a decadant warm chocolate mousse
) This place is what makes dining out a delightful event!
I had an amazing dinner at 9th St
We walked in and were immediately seated in what I viewed a cozy (not cramped) table for two
Wine list had a great selection and our waiter, who I assume was an owner of sorts, was very knowledgable
We tried their Chicken Fried Steak and the Roasted Chicken
both were pretty amazing and served with creative sides of radishes, watercress
Our appetizer salad had candied nuts - delicious! Dessert, an Apple Crisp, didnt seem to be as mind blowing as the rest of the meal, but perhaps thats because I didnt leave a bite left, I was too full! I will definately be back to 9th St Market!
So we showed up for dinner around 7:30pm, a decent, early dinner time
Seated immediately
We were squished into a tiny table between two other parties also squished in
We started taking off our layers, but the fireplace was roaring and simply way too hot (and I'm anemic, so I'm always cold!)
The waiter handed us menus consisting of about 7 entrees, and after telling us the specials, informed us that there was no chicken
Hm
well, that left pork and fish
So for those of us who eat neither, we were SOL
So we left
And the prices were enormously high anyway
We most likely will not be back
My date and I ventured out of our apartment on a freezing cold Sunday evening and found a little piece of heaven
9th Street Market is perfect for a Romantic evening
We sat by the roaring fire place and shared a rather beautiful bottle of wine
The food was perfect, scallops yummmm
and the service was fantastic
I recommend this tiny little place with it's casual and warm atmosphere and very tastey eats
the food is definitely worth the wait
the french toast is a must and i usually order this to split in addition to my meal
at only about $10 per entree/meal which includes coffee and juice, this will definitely leave you feeling yummy in your tummy for the rest of the day
because of the limited seating, try going on weekdays
I tried this cute cozy restaurant because of the Diner's Deck
I'm usually afraid to try new restaurants but this deck gave me a discount so I felt safe to try something new
The atmospshere felt like a warm homely place with classic yet creative foods
It reminded me of simple foods that are just so well prepared it takes a comfort to another dimension! I'll be going back regularly even without the card! Thanks for an amazing meal 9th st
Market and thanks Diner's deck for helping me find this wonderful place!
One of the top brunch spots in NYC
It's quite small, and cramped, which can at times feel cozy, and at times like a sardine can
Otherwise, it's an epicurean delight
Great: Clam chowder with beacon, French toast, omelets, salads, corn bread, coffee, fruit
Deserts are also fab
I've been here once for dinner, and it didn't compare to brunch
They have brunch down to an art and a science
This is one of my favorate place in the East Village
Very cozy and intimate with great food that not only tastes great but also will fill you up
Can't get a reservation for dinner? Try their brunch made to perfection!
I have visited this cute restaurant for brunch several times despite the fact that I live on the other side of town
The brunch is fabulous and worth the wait in the cold on the weekend! However, this weekend I brought a friend from out of town to dinner at the restaurant
The service at this time is mediocre and the food was terrible
Despite the fact that my guest and I had the majority of our plates full of food when we were told the waiter we were done, he ignored that fact and didn't bother to ask if anything was wrong
Very disappointing because I love them for brunch!!! Way too expensive for the dinner dining experience especially given the mediocrity of hte dinner
Tucked away on 9th street is a little restaurant aptly named 9th Street Market
The menu: gourmet meets down home cooking
The result: a most refined yee-haw
For dessert, have the cobbler--it will knock your shoes off
It's a tiny place and fills up quickly, so make reservations
And don't ask for substitutions on the menu after 8:30pm
They will laugh at you
My friends and I only come here for brunch, and we always have so much fun
The food is phenomenal! The French toast comes loaded with luscious fruit, and the eggs with black beans and salsa on a hard tortilla are wonderful
This was a very cute little nook of a restaurant
great for dates! Quiet, beautiful flowers everywhere, the wines by the glass were good, food was tasty (I had a monkfish risotto which was delightful)
All and all, a great find!
This a now top on my list
If you are looking for a romantic getaway or a place to take the parents or a refuge from the typical trendy loud resturants which crowd the East Village then this is it! The food is tasty, inventive, and has a pure farm fresh flavor as if you were eating at a BB somewhere in New England
Did I mention the fireplace and the sweet sublte smell of wood burning
This place is a gem! I do suggest you go early so, you can get the full effect
I came on a recommendation from a friend
This place is just terrific for my anniversary with my girlfriend
The food was pretty good, I recommend the crabcakes
The maple creme brulee was good but I've had better

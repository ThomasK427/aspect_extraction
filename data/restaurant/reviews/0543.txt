The entrees are wonderful but save room for the dessert!
We double-dated at Spice the other night, and I was very pleased with our experience
The drinks were cheap (lychee bellini
yum!), the food portions hearty (I was almost full after my appetizer of warm duck salad), and the quality of food was average to above average
For a nice variation on the classic pad thai, try the drunk man's noodle
Overall, a good meal for a VERY good price
This place is awesome! The food is amazing (the drunk man's noodles are awesome, but H-O-T!)
Ambiance is cool
A little noisy at dinner time, but bearable! Definitely must try if in the neighborhood!
NYU-ers love this place! Cheap, good food (but not really as authentic as I'd like), and always a good place to go for a quick bite
NEVER go for dinner- the line is out the door and around the corner
Lunch is the best! for 7$ you get a free appetizer with your entree and there's almost never a line
Red curry with shrimp is currently my favorite
The pad thai is mediocre though- I've had better
Spice has great food, but the atmosphere leaves much to be desired
While the look is appealing art deco, it is so crowded that you can barely hear yourself speak
Service is sufficient, but the wait staff can be overly abrupt at times
I would recommend eating in the restaurant for a quick bite, but otherwise get takeout and make it more pleasant at home
The price is right! But, the service is a nightmare -- you are served by at least five different people before you leave, and none of them speaks english nor can they hear you above the roaring crowds and lame techno
A fantastic option for delivery -- and try the curry puffs appetizer
Thai restaurants are still not as abundant as Italian restaurants in the city so
this great is a great place to get decently priced Thai food
The service isn't fantastic and the seating is a bit tight but if you aren't looking Four Seasons type quality, then this is the perfect spot to meet some friends for dinner or lunch
The proximity to Union Square (and lots of bars) is convenient and the food is slightly above average
The decor is funky but yes, a bit cheesy
The food is pretty good, but after 2 or 3 bad experiences at the restaurant (consistently rude, late with RSVP'd seating), I decided I would only order delivery
After being told 25 minutes I received my food after a little over an hour and I live 3 blocks away
Aside from that, the quality (and quantity) of the food has greatly deteriorated
There are many better options- spare yourself the aggravation
I wanted to come to this restaurant because it's always packed and with a line every time I passed by
After trying it, I agree with the other review about not understanding what the crowds are all about
The food is okay, it's inexpensive, service not bad, ambience quite unique for Thai
All in all, an okay place to go
But if there is a correlation between the size of crowd and quality, I'd have to say it's overrated
The food here is good, but certainly nothing amazing, and it doesn't explain the massive groups of people who are always here
Neither does the ambiance which tries to be trendy, but ends up having people feel packed in, and has a kind of cheap feel to it
The major thing that works in Spice's favor is that the food is cheap
At lunch, $7 buys you an entree and an appetizer, which is a great deal
Dinner isn't too pricey, with entrees at around $8
00, and appetizers running up to about $5
00
It's still a cheap dinner spot, but the best deal is at lunch
For dinner, there are better places to try
I have been to Spice a few times and thought the food was good
I went back recently and the service was horrible
We ordered Thai BBQ chicken and it was so dry you couldn't eat it and the General Manager gave us a HUGE problem about exchanging it for something less dry
He tried telling me it was restaurant policy
what kind of policy is that
i would never go back to that location
Although the food at Spice is excellent, I do not recommend the location at University Place because of their service
It takes forever for them to serve you just drinks, and some of the waiters seem to not comprehend what you order
One time, my friend and I were waiting to be seated and the hostess slapped my friend's shoulder and snapped follow me
My friend asked her to not do that again, and she told us we don't have to come back
Very rude!!! We left and never went back after that
I highly recommend the Chelsea location for friendly service and Sea Restaurant (I believe it's the same company as Spice) in Williamsburg, Brooklyn
If you want to go to a Spice that has great service, do not go to University Place
The food is very good, however you sit so close to everyone that it's hard to hear what your company is saying
They don't give enough soda, despite the fact coke comes in a glass bottle
Those are my only complaints but i enjoyed the food
We have had many delivery problems with Spice
They are rude and often very slow
Recently they gave our food to someone else in the building (since they apparently couldn't be bothered to tell them what apartment they were delivering for) and then claimed it was our fault and that we should pay
They then tried to reserve us food they had given to someone else! Horrible service and the manager was completely arrogant and obnoxious
the food at spice is great, much better than republic's thai food
the pad thai and drunken man noodles are great tasting and generous in portion
however, don't stay too long and chat
there's always people waiting to be seated and the chairs are not comfortable
quite a few great tasting dishes, like the panang curry, or drunken man noodles, thai caesar! take out is pretty quick
pretty reasonable too
it's very loud, so don't go with a low talker
I've been to Spice quite a few times and have never been disappointed
It's a bit crowded and you may have to wait to be seated but you don't have to wait too long for the food to come out
Try the strawberry mojo drink - it's great
Also, the best bet is to get a few of the appetizers and split them with the table because all of them that I've tried and very tasty and the sauces are excellent
The entrees are a good size and I always leave full
I had dinner last Thursday with an old friend and we both are foodies
When it comes to Thai, we expect more than peanut sauce on Satay and pad thai
The interior was mod and cool
We had the Jade Dumplings, Fish Cake Tower to start
Main Entree was Volcanic Chicken (Flambee'd on the plate) and Grilled Salmon
Food was good but seating could get cramped as dinner progressed
Overall, not too shabby for the ambiance and the scene
A real find in Union Square area
Such a deal
stir fry pinapple chicken is amazing (only $6 for lunch and $9 for dinner) really good price for the taste and portion size
it's amazing that they can afford to make it such a trendy, stylish place w/ the prices they charge
the only thing bad about the place is that the seats are WAY too low
I ordered from Spice tonight and it took approximately an hour and 45 minutes to get to me
I live less than half a mile away
The food was fine, nothing special, but I really wouldn't order it if you're hungry in the least
Most Thai restuarants in manhattan are catered to American taste
However this place taste like authentic Thai food and it's reasonably priced
Lunch specials are 7 and contain appetizer and a huge entree
Gets packed during lunch time from NYU kids but definitely is a great dining experience
Great value for a nice looking restaurant with great food and service
what gives with New Yorkers thinking they know what good Thai food is? This place is mediocre, but popular because its reasonable - esp
for lunch
You can do a lot better for food though - and its loud
The lunch special (at $6-$7) includes an appetizer and main course
The food is GREAT

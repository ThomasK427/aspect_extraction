Good place for a non-meat eater to get a nice snack or lunch
I highly recommend the tuna salad sandwich -- and the hummus and avocado sandwich sounds peculiar but is really quite the taste sensation
The coffee is great
and the owners and staff just ooze charm and personality
If you are a guy, this is a great place to meet some interesting, attractive women (aka hot chicks)
In addition to the great iced coffee, and fantastic service, the space is so cute!! Just the place to bring a few of your friends to hang out, or just sit and read a paper
I would definitely recommend it
i think that this is one of the many establishments which will come to personify this fast changing ecletic neighborhood
a real treat for anyone who ventures inside and meets either of the two lovely ladies who own and run pillow
everything is fresh and delicious
a real treat
try everything !!!
Fianlly, a coffee shop with great coffee! This cafe is probably one of the best hidden treasures in this neighborhood
Their House Blend from Irving farm is to die for and even their teas are amazing, not to speak of the sandwiches
I recommend the tuna
The owners are behind the bar, so you get that excellent service
You'll find lots of artists here
In Short Blue walls, green palms, terra cotta floors, and languid ceiling fans conjure the leisurely cafes of Caracas while the Venezuelan specialties further transport patrons to the land of Hugo Chavez
Everyone here is eating the arepas, savory corn cakes stuffed with everything from flank steak to panella cheese and anise seed
Other homespun specialties include hearty pabellon, a plate of stewed meat, rice, beans, plantains; yucca fries with sour cream; and tequenones, savory cheese pastry sticks
Need I say more?! I went last Saturday, for the first time, and fell in love with the food
I'm definetely going back for more
I never had Venezuelan food before
but I'm a lover now! If you've never had Venezuelan food before
be sure to ask the waitress for suggestions
so you can maximize your experience!
I had heard too much about this place to not sample it when I was in the area and what a delightful experience it was! The place was small, crowded but cosy and our pretty waitress was able to service us well despite the fact she had to wait 8 tables on her own
The food was great, from appetizers to entrees as were the drinks
The Pollo Al Horno was succulent and perfectly tender, and our arepas (Pabellon, Domino, Con Pernil) were delicious as well
Our waitress convinced us to try one of their featured drinks, the Guarapita, which was awesome
While the drinks didn't come in large glasses and the arepas were not large in size, they had a taste about them that made you only want more
I love the arepas - chicken or pork sandwich with Plaintain bread
They serve wine and beer
I also am a huge an of the roasted chicken with yuca and salad
The rice and beans with beef or chicken or pork is outstanding
The atmosphere is spotless, but not sterile
It reminds me of the traditional places one would find in Miami, but this one is CLEAN
The food is CLEAN, not greasy
I love the music and the family friendly atmosphere
Its a real neighborhood restaurant
Awesome arepas -- exactly how you would find them in Venezuelan (just a tad more pricey :-) Nevertheless, great food
The only bad thing about this place is the service--its so slow and the glasses they use for water are too small
Eating at el Cocotero was a marvelous experience
It feels at first transported to a tropical island: the ambince,music friendly smiles makes you feel rigt in
Startig our meal with a few tropical drinks : a refreshing limeade call papelon, watermelon juice,mango and a banana shakes
Our waitress sugested a Degustacion(a taste) since we never had arepas before
It came in a beautiful assorted set of small colorful dishes with four or five different toppings so we could made our own interpretation of those spongy crispy delicius corn cakes
That was fantastic! Then we moved to our main and generous portion size main dishes; our best favorites were the tamal, wrapped in banana leaf sauted shrimp in a cilantro vinagrette sauce
Don't forget to ask for the tres leches cake the uniques cafe con leche(love those cups!) !
Coming to El Cocotero feels just like home
There's more than just an arepa menu in here
I was delighted to ask for prosciutto to the lovely waitress Miriam and she replied I don't think so but I can accommodate that ;) in the very own refreshing venezuelan humor
Ten minutes later BINGO!! I was indulged by the hot, spongy, and crusty with thinly sliced prosciutto melting in my mouth arepa
To wash it down Miriam suggested a PASSIONMOSA (a concoction of passion fruit juice an sparkling wine) DELICCIOUS!! I had been to other venezuelan places downtown, but I definitely stay in Chelsea where the great food and atmosphere really touches my belly and heart
It's a delicious experience
You should try tequenos, also the patacones, they are very good
It's a great place to share
The food was great! Highly recommended
The server's attitude ruined our dinner
First, our table was not cleaned before we were seated
I put the old scraps on another uncleaned table
The server saw it, and sarcastically said, Thank you
As if we were being rude? Later, we told her we had some questions about the menu
After answering one of our questions, she ran off and didn't come back for several minutes
I wish we had had Lucho or one of the other servers people liked in the other reviews!
Tucked away on 18th St
, El Cocotero is my wife's and my favorite restaurant
The food is always fresh delicious and the staff is friendly and welcoming
If you've never had Venezuelan food before, it may not be what ou expect
It's lightly spiced and refreshing
We always go away feeling full but not like we grew a third buttock
Try the coffee
It's a must! There is no liquor here, but with the small setting, we find this to be a plus
The beverages they do have, mostly juices and juice mixtures, are wonderful!
I have never been to Venezuela but after experiencing the amazing cuisine at El Cocotero I feel like I have traveled to Caracas or perhaps a little village nearby
The place is homey and friendly and warm and the food is hearty and delicious
It was a lot of fun to try entrees I had never heard of and to be pleasantly surprised by everything I tried
And usually I am pretty fussy!
The food was exceptional! It overtakes your taste buds as soon as you take that first bite - youve never tasted anything this wonderful in your life! Everything is exceptional at El Cocotero! The prices are affordable; the restaurant is immaculate and has a great atmosphere you could take anyone to
It is a very family place and they treat you like family! The service couldn't be any more efficient and the owners, chefs, and waiters/waitresses couldn't be better
I highly recommend this great restaurant! It's all about harmony!
For a joyous hit of satisfaction and some taste bud satisfying Venezuelan specialties, not to mention the satisfying homey hospitality of cook/host/co-owner Lucho, get yourself to El Cocotero now
And if you're lucky, you'll run into the smiles of the other co-owners, Arturo and Grayson, all eager to add to the charm and delight
Had the roast pork with rice and beans with sweet plantain
The pork was dressed with a clean tasting onion/pepper relish, the beans tasty
My friend had roast chicken with yucca fries and salad
Not the cheapest latin food, nor the most expensive; but the clean flavors and pleasant decor made it an experience to be repeated
Went there round 5:30 so can't say how it is in peak times
Happened upon El Cocotero while strolling through the neighborhood
We never tried Venezuelan food before we were happily surprised
The food was served fresh and in a timely manner
The ambiance was nice as well
I'd recommend it
I dont know what some reviewers consider cheap
Personally when I think cheap, I think of getting stuffed with good food for $10 or less
Dinner for two at El Cocotero came out to $40 including tip
I would not consider $20 a head to be cheap
The food was good (but not great) and considering the price, I would only eat here if I was in the area and in the mood for some Venezuelan food
When you come here, you forget that you're in the middle of New York
The food is very tasty, you will not be dissappointed by the portions sizes, try the areapas, very good

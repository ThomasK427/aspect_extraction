Decore -- fabulous
It has become my new favorite place in Hoboken
The food was awesome
My spicy chicken with pineapples, peppers and cashew nuts was fantastic, the massaman curry was good and the pad thai was great
The owner was not
She rushed us, placing our check on the table and then thumping it with her hand saying, Money, money, give me my money
As we were leaving, she pointed out that I was the only female in a party of 6 and that I should be careful because my male friends look like child molesters
She was joking, but this isn't my brand of comedy
The way they pack your food to-go is horrible too
They put something with soup in one of those cardboard cartons
And then they lump all your leftovers in the same container
It's easy to get a table at this longtime Hoboken restaurant, because residents have caught on to how overpriced and badly made the food is
The atmosphere is romantic the service is excellent, but that doesn't compensate for the fact that MOST of dishes here are terrible
If you want to spend your money on a meal, go around the corner to The Madison or Frankie Johnnie's instead
They may be overpriced, but at least it's worth it!
The selections on the menu sounded great, but it was missing some basics that I think all Italian restaurants should have
like fish! The only fish entrees offered were specials, or as ingredients in a pasta dish
The service was excellent
May be a bit overpriced
I have been several tims and find the staff very friendly especially FRank behind the bar
SOme times you wait and others you find the right time to be there food is great and the roof top bar outstanding on a summer night
The entire experience at the City Bistro can be summed up as hit or miss - black and white
You could have an amazing time on the rooftop sipping on drinks or get blocked from even going upstairs
The crowd could be nice and calm with a mix of men and women or a frat party
And the food - it can either be a delight or overpriced copy from down the street
The most disappointing thing is the lack of knowledge into frequent customers
First, the owner and staff are some friendly and helpful characters
Second, the mutz is the best you'll ever taste
Third, the roast beef and other sandwiches are not only delicious, they're cheap considering the amount of food
Hot Roast Beef (cooked that day), Fresh Mozzerella (made on premises) hot gravy from the roast beef
Best ever - the hot roast beef is only offered on Tuesday (or Thurs) and Sat
Gotta get there early because the line will be out the door - worth the wait
Best mozzarella in town!! Try the sandwich with roast beef, mozz, gravy, and roasted red pepeers
It'll last you all day
Nice Family owned traditional restaurant
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order
I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken
Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you're with
I didn't expect much from this tiny establishment, but after passing it up so many times, I took a chance 1 night tried it w/ some friends
We were pleasantly surprised
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca
Don't expect over-the-top service - this is a small place w/ a small staff, but they were friendly very accommodating, when they could be found
The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen
A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town
Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place
My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni
com, and we were thouroughly disapointed
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce
After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like
I've never been treated so rudely
Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing food and the BEST service
SERVICE, QUALITY OF PRODUCTS and PRICE are EXCELLENT!!! They have the Best Mutz in Hoboken!! They also provide expert catering, 3-6 foot sandwiches, and service with a smile
I have been going to them for years and have never been dissapointed
Great tasty pizza
I think you get the idea from other reviews,
hint
slices are not small
Very good and reasonably priced
If you expecting to dine like royalty, Benny's is not he place for you
If you want the BIGGEST and best slice of pizza you will ever eat, you are finally here
For a mere 2 bucks you get a slice that is soft, chewy and oh so wicked good
Did I mention BIG
This slice is, no joke, the same size as the placemats
It occupies 2 plates
Try it, you will not be disappointed
Besides, where else can you get a meal for 2 beans in Hoboken
After searching for the best NY slice in Manhattan, I quite possibly found it in Hoboken, NJ of all places!! It deffinitely has the best dough of any place I've been to, and a good pizza enthusiast knows that the dough is key to making the perfect pie
This same gigantic slice would run you anywhere near $3
50 in NYC, but for the mere price of $1
75 makes this joint the cradle of pizza salvation! If Benny Tudino started a whole new religeon tommorow, belive me, I'd convert without hesistation
I'd sell my soul for a slice!
Benny's Pizza in Hoboken is the best pizza
Ever since I can remember, going to Benny's was and is a treat
We live over an hour away and love to go to Benny's
My mom use to take the drive for a Benny's pizza when she was pregnant with my little bro
She and dad would drive up, eat, and drive back
My friends hear stories of a Benny's slice
Most slices eaten in one sitting: 4; we are trying for more (it's like eatting 2 regular size pies)
Being a NJ guy, I've been eating here forever
I've been all over the country, eating pizza everywhere else
no one TOUCHES Benny's
New Yorkers say there's nothing like NY pizza??? BS
Go to Benny's for the best-tasting, best-priced, biggest slice of pizza you'll ever have
I love this place
Huge slices of pizza, great buffalo wings! Good food, great value! You cant go wrong with this Hoboken Staple
By far and away the best pizza I ever had
The pizza is large, teh sauce is tangy and the cheese is well distributed
I can't really vouch for the other food there since I usually only get the cheese pizza
The other flavors are tasty but the cheese slices our out of this world
Yummy!
This restaurant has been a family fall-back for all the years I can remember
The food is good quality Italian fare
especially the chicken francaise
which I think is one of the best renderings I've ever had
This is the pizza place in the opening credits to the Sopranos
It also happens to be the best pan pizza you can buy
Get it to go I highly suggest the sausage pies (well done)
It took about 30 min for our first appetizer to come, and then they forgot to bring our second one
Waited another 30 min for our entrees to come
Food was not bad, but nothing really special

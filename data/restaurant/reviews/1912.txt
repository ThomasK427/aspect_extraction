This is my favorite Thai restaurant
Ever try to get some friends together on a Saturday night? I can be a hassle, but when we made a reservation for our group, there it was a table for eight, and the food was outrageous
We ordered family style, I tried almost everything
The phad thai is some of the best I have had in the city, full of shrimp And the massaman curry with beef is a dish I wish I did not have to share
I am definetly gonna get this for myself the next time I go
I love this place
My girlfriend and I stopped in to our favorite Thai restaurant again last night
I swear they got some of the best food in the city
I always start with this beef salad, there is beef in every bite and also the shrimp spring rolls, DELICIOUS! this time I had this chicken dish for dinner, I swear, its the best chicken I had in the city, the meat just slips off the bone
Sometimes the place gets mad busy, but no worries, its a great place to people watch
And the bar has great drinks to pacify anyone anxious about a wait
This place rocks
This place is not terrible, but should not have been the Best of 2003 Audience winner nor should it have come in second in the editorial picks
The food is OK to mediocre at best
To be fair, if you want to go out for THAI dinner and drinks in a fun, hip, spot with attractive people, it's hard to compete with Kin Khao's SOHO location and its warmly lit space
But the food is way too sweet
Almost everything is smothered in some form of ridiculously sugary syrup, jam, or other peanut sauce variant gone horribly wrong
Clearly designed to appeal to a western audience with a sweet tooth
Pongsri Thai, Royal Siam, and Wondee Siam all have better food at better prices
The food was horrible (when it finally came out after 45 minutes), and they screwed up the order on top of it
Would never go back
I was at Kin Khao last week and a sexy waitress assisted me in choosing my entre
I was dining alone and was thrilled at the attention
Anyway, I ordered the green curry chicken on her recommendation
The imbibement was a kin khao colada,a savory mix of malibu, pineapple juice, and some mysterios homemade vodka they purvey
This meal my friends, was one of the most satisfying, sultry, and tasty duos my mouth has ever had the pleasure to entertain
I tipped 40% to show my appreciation, up from my usual 9
5%
Friends, I heartily insist that you frequent this beautiful establishment
The service is excellent, the ambiance is stellar, the banquet cannot be bested, and the prices are prodigal
My friends and I were having a mini get together last Friday and they were so pleased that I picked Kin Khao!! Food was delicious (Jing Bing
the pork chops
and the beef salad
yum
yum
), drinks were strong (Ting Hua Tini and Pineapple Pat Pong rock!!) and service was excellent
Although we were waiting for about an hour before we got our table, however, the overall experience was totally worth while
You guys are always busy
But I continue to wait
I wanted to thank you guys for wonderful bar scene on Thursday
Heck that is where I met my future husband
I think it must have been the Ginger on Ginger he drank
Good inducer
My high recommendations for all ladies in waiting
I first came to Kin Khao 5 years ago on the advice of a taxi cab driver
5 years later I have moved into the city and Kin Khao was the first place that I visited
The food is still great as ever, if not better
Kin Khao has only gotten better with age! Just like me! The food is flavorful and the selection of wines and drinks are a great compliment
The dishes here are as authentic as I have ever tasted in New York City
The beat to the place was great
It was packed when I went in so we had to wait a bit but it was definately worth it
Honestly, one of the best Thai places around
Nothing is sacrifice
We loved the ambiance the best
There was a bustle to the place yet not too loud at all
Satisfied with the food (their pad thai wasn't as good as some other places), but the ambiance and service makes up for it
I'd definitely go back to try some of their other dishes
Kin Khao is quite possibly THE BEST thai restaurant I have ever been to
Besides the fabulous vibe and distinctly romantic ambiance, the service, the drinks and the food is outstanding
I particularly like the Ginger Kamikazees which combine their own infused ginger voka with a splash of pineapple juice which gives it a little sweet and sour taste
Those are the best
I loved the #23 which is a curry tofu dish with a side of wonderfully seasoned rice displayed nicely in a plantain leaf
This is definitely a date spot, I went with my boyfriend a few times and always leave completely satisfied
I'm very picky when it comes to eating out (i'm vegetarian) so take my word for it and have a beautiful meal with a beautiful person, at Kin Khao
food here is good - not the point of this review
the hostess has consistently managed to ruin my dinners here
on more than one occasion, our group entered and was ignored by her - to an unacceptable degree
on one occasion, we started leaning past her stand to get a look at the back dining room
we muttered aloud to ourselves i wonder if we can go in, she looked up and shot us a very bitchy no, then proceeded to take some more time with whatever she was doing, grabbed some menus, and brought us to a table without a word, like we were farm animals being led to a trough
absolutely unacceptable
management should be made aware that she's representing them this way, and remind this employee that it's her job to be courteous to the people that give the restaurant business and give her her paycheck
I have been to Kin Khao MANY times now
And I have yet to be disappointed
My wife and I can't get enough of the pla lard prik fish dish
And many thanks that you guys brought back the jing bing, i thought i might soon be having withdrawals
To top it off you keep you drink menus changing and there are always new and tasty cocktails
Thanks
Good Food and great ambiance
Romantic
Good Service
Loved the food
would go again and would recommed to my friends
I have been to Kin Khao at least a half a dozen times by now, probably more, and each time it has been with a different crowd, all of whom have absolutely fell in love with place and only returned with more friends
The throw pillows on your seat with the votives on the tables provide an unpretentious cozy ambience for dinner with friends or a romantic evening with your beau
Kin Khao offers the New Yorker the trendy twist of Soho while keeping the taste buds authentic so each and every morsel is savored
Finally, the excellent service and reasonable prices always keep you coming back for more
Enjoy!
So I tried Daily Chow the other day and heard about Kin Khao and decided to try that this week as well
PERFECT
Love the romantic ambiance, love the food and love that you can see all the delicious food being cooked in front of you!! and i tried the new green tea maritni
I was deliciously satiated
Thanks
The cool and modern decor of Kin Khao might look somewhat out of place in the den of iniquity that is Bangkok, but it makes a pleasing addition to the New York Thai scene
The restaurant is always bustling and flames leaping off the open grill make for a dramatic dinner
The limited menu contains some real gems, notably the shrimp spring rolls and the steak tenderloin
Caffeine addicts will have to find their fix elsewhere as coffee is curiously not on the menu, but the Singha beer and decent wine list more than compensates
Simple food that's not too expensive
but it comes at a price: poor service
I'd suggest you stay away until for now
When my table was ready on the evening of 9/13, I had nicely asked the hostess if my party of 3 could be seated further back, where there was an empty table for 4

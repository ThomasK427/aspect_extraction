However, the food is mediocre and not worth the money
After all, a good restaurant ought to serve decent food and not just the atmosphere
The most unbearable is not the 1h30 wait to be seated
It's the staff that keeps telling you that your table will be ready in 5-10 minutes
Don't believe anything from what the staff tells you
They will take your reservation but won't honour it
The food deserves a special mention too: it's awful, both in taste and presentation
Don't go there for good North African food
There are many other places in the LES
The only good point is the atmosphere
one of the best I've experienced in NY
So, go there for a drink
never for dinner!
I brought a potential client visiting from LA to Le Souk for dinner and drinks and loved it
The staff was attractive and efficent and freindly - the food was top notch and some of the seasoning used was very new and fresh tasting for me
The combo of having a male and female belly dancer was very over the top and surreal- the atomosphere was like a movie set- i was expecting to see a camel at any moment
Needless to say - i have a new client and Le SOuk has 2 new fans- one here and one in LA- They really covered all their bases at this winning spot on happening Ave B
The complete and total rudeness and frustration surrounding this place started with the hostess calling us in the middle of the afternoon asking if we could change our reservation
When told no, she very rudely informed us to be there on time
Then, after we were seated, we were told we could only order from the price fix menu
Needless to say, the food was good but NOTHING could make up for the total lack of respect for the clientele
NOT WORTH IT!!!
We had a really fun time
The atmosphere was the coolest thing about the restaurant
The food was definitely above average (so good)
The belly dancers were amazing never seen three dancers at the same time including a male belly dancer
going back soon
As Good as the first time Second time at le souk
As good if not better than the first time
This time we went knowing when to go
The first time our waitress gave us all the info about when to go, according to what we were looking for
It was Tuesday night
We did not want to be among large crowed
It was perfect
Fortunately, the same waitress was working
She remembered us! Imagine that
Out of the people that go there! Again went with the recommendations and were impressed
We even got free sangria out of the deal
was amazing
Keep up the good job
Le Souk is for sure an institution on the east village
We intent to keep going on different nights to get the overall experience
We wanted to try something new, had heard of le souk, so we went
We had a great time, the food was good and the service was so friendly
simply the best excelent ambiance
beautiful decor
right price for the right product
Excelent profesional service
fun entertaining belly dancers must see
Le Souk offers a perfect atmosphere for having fun even in the middle of a hard-work week
The young staff is very cool
Their garden (includes a nomad style tent) is just charming, small, no pretentions, with a simple decoration (walls and pillars covered by very ethnic fabrics, a nice rich and warm yellow wall and ceramic-tiles tables)
Great music with the last middle-eastern pop/rai stars
I had one of the most relaxed and at the same time fun nights
The server with the desert tray was very helpful and pacient, it was an atypical way of tempting you to commit a gourmand sin
The food wasn't too expensive and its quality and taste was proportionate
I would recommend it as young , with a nice Maghreb sunny ambiance and decor
The belly-dancer is a plus but customers and staff are the ones making the fiesta
Maybe it was just the Hooka talking, but I left le souk feeling completely satisfied and excited about my return trip, which should be in about a week (hopefully to catch that belly-dancer in action again)
I am usually put off by having to wait for someone to take my order, then wait even longer for them to bring me my food, but at le souk, I found my experience was well worth the wait
The authentic decor and amazing belly-dancers helped pass the time, and I found my cous-cous paella to be well worth the wait
Expect to spend a long time when visiting le souk, but expect to love every minute of it
Generous portions of very good food, courteous (although not completely attentive) waitstaff, bellydancers (female AND male), hookas, outdoor dining
If this is anything like Morocco, I'm on the next flight (or at the very least coming back to Le Souk very soon)
Definitely worth the trip to the East Village
Cheaper than my trip to Morocco last spring, but just as authentic
Tent in the back is the perfect place for a party, very cool
I've lived in Alphabet City for 6 years now and I've been waiting for a place like this
The ambiance is amazing, the food is great and the price is affordable
How many other places do you get live entertainment (BELLY DANCERS!!!!), while you dine
The service was decent, but the overall experience was phenominal
My friends and I decided to have a ladies night out last Friday
We chose Le Souk because we thought it would be a fun place with good drinks and food
The food and drinks were good
But after sitting down at 9, no one even took a drink order until 9:30
Then the waiter came back for our food order at 10, and we hadn't received our drinks yet
Then we got drinks and our appetizer platter at 10:30
We got our salad plates at 11
At 11:30, having not received the drink refills we asked for and being very hungry from not having received our entrees, we asked for a manager
Rather than dealing with the problem, the manager tried to ply us with liquor
Well, thanks for the drinks, but you can bet I'll never waste 3 hours waiting for an entree at Le Souk again
If you can handle the noise, commotion, not-very-downtown prices and slow (but very friendly) service, Le Souk serves some great food
Assorted appetizer plate is amazing, and the lamb tagine was hearty and flavorful
White wine sangria was nice, too
The Scene A slightly dressy but unpretentious crowd comes here for a low-key evening out
The decor emphasizes the blond wood that's a standard at sushi restaurants, with an idiosyncratic twist provided by the illuminated, leaf-like designs that cover the ceiling like a carapace
Service is fast, pleasant and efficient enough to cover a high weekend turnover of tables
The Food Mizu falls somewhere in the mid-range of Manhattan's sushi restaurants
The servings are generous (almost too much so--the sushi rolls have a tendency to fall apart), and the giant sushi and sashimi plate for two will fill even the most ravenous appetites
Miso soup, chuka salad and shrimp tempura are all reliable
the food was good- tried a warm roll, pretty unique
the crowd was strangely loud and obnoxious
everyone in the restaurant was screaming whcih made for an uncomfortable environemnt but that wasnt the restuarants fault i suppose
good prices for food and pretty filling
Great sushi! Lot's of special rolls to choose from and the one's that I tried were very good
Very fresh and very friendly service
A friend and I met at Mizu last night for dinner; after a short wait of 15 minutes, we were given a nice little table by the window
We shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi
What generous portions! I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy
As far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done

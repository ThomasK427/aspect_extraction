We only ordered desserts and drinks, but no refills were offered
Anyhow, we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat, which was nice
I'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good
such a 'blah' place
went for a solo lunch the other day as was in the area and well, it was just alright'
waitress had a snobby attitude which was funny as it's not exactly Balthazars
Bartender was attentive and pleasant though
should pull their socks up as there are many better places in the area
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date
We were then shooed inside
One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
We left, never to return
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care
The waiting staff here can be quite snobby
One time we were told (after being seated) to go to the bar instead because one of us didnot want to order dinner
This was unexceptable considering that the place was not even filled
Spoke to the manager who was carefree about it!!! This incident left a bad taste in my mouth
But, the place is pretty charming
The best thing about French Roast is that it is opened 24-7 so it's quite convienient
The food is not great and is not really worth the prices
It's nice and quiet, but certainly not a five star kind of cafe
I suggest going to lalo instead, which is right up the cross street-- happier waiters, better food, and cheerier lighting
There for breakfast on a slow Tuesday morning
Asked for Croissants - they were out
Asked for Marmalade (coomon in France) had to wait 5 minutes until a non spanish speaking person came to say there was only cheap American jam (jelly)
When Smoked Salmon Eggs arrived it was decent
Very disappointing
Been in the evening and it was value and fun and good
THere is no excuse for this sloppiness
So much competition in the area
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner
I was pleasantly suprised
The food was exceptional
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc
I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual
The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
Snobby service and food I would not feed my dog
I respect him to much
Over priced for what it is - a glorified starbucks that can not make a decent cup of coffee
In Short Though the name refers to a 16th century children's game, the atmosphere at this bistro is decidedly grown-up
Beyond the green awning and floor-to-ceiling windows, sophisticated (and often European) patrons drink wine from the bar in back and dine on French fare like nicoise salad, foie gras, and steak tartare at tightly packed tables
Brightly painted canvases on the walls and large floral bouquets offset the prim white tablecloths
Friday night, Packed, way too loud
I asked the dorr man about the music
he stated,it has been this loud for 20 years
I left! If I wanted to goto a club
I would!
Not sure what that guy was talking about Ive never had a bad experience here
Always find the staff very friendly and accommodating even when they are extremely busy-as they usually are
Theres also something known as a reservation
Call ahead and you will most definitely get a table sooner
But keep in mind that clients will sit and linger so not every reservation can be honored immediately; especially at such a small establishment
Great date place, excellent food, friendly staff and great ambiance
Best dish: Cajun chicken
Showed up last night around 8:00pm with a date per a recommendation from a friend
We were told to wait outside in the rain (due to such small size of place), for about 25 minutes for our table
So we sit down at an outside table under the awning to have a glass of wine while we wait
In the 20 minutes we spent waiting just for a server to take our wine order, the host of this establishment proceeded to let couple after couple walk right in in-front of us because he obviously knew them
The kicker came when he told another couple in French (I speak French so I caught on to this), that the wait for them was only 10 minutes! Hello, we've been standing out here and he tells us 25, but them 10? Keep in mind I was with a very beautiful girl and we had lots of $$ to spend
This place is not worth the hassle
We went across the street to Nello's and had an amazing meal
Save yourself the trouble unless you are best friends with the Host or speak fluent French
You will enjoy this euro haunt if you are open to a tiny crowded space, and not terribly concerned with waits or US style service culture
Patrons (us included) go there for a good time, consistently lush and delicious French bistro food, and simply being
elsewhere
Never been treated rudely, always leave with spirits high and appetite for next visit
A sexy place
Good Cajun chicken, fun place, attitude of all kind but you either like or hate it
I LOVE IT
This is the kind of place where if it's your scene you will love it, if you don't then you probably don't get it and never will
The food is good, the service outstanding and the ambiance
spectacular! It's a very fun Euro scene
The loud music and people flickering the lights are all part of what makes this place a unique spot in NYC
I have been there for both a quiet romantic dinner as well as late night dancing with all the tables cleared out (and mind you this was a Tuesday night!)
It's a great find and the snobby staff just want to keep it that way!
I have seen several bad reviews, but have to let you know I have really enjoyed Le Bilboquet every time I have visited
During my last visit, my friend and I did not have a reservation
The waiter told us it would be 20 minutes, so we went across the street to The Post House for a drink
As promised, our table was ready
The food was exceptional (especially the Cajun Chicken), the service was impeccable and the atmosphere was fun and lively
Definitely worth a wait (but obviously not outside)!
This is probably the worst experience I had in a New York restaurant
While waiting outside in the cold - we noticed that other people disregarded the wait and headed on into the place to be seated before us
When we asked the manager how this can happen!? He said in a deep French accent These are our friends!, he then continued to say that if we were customers for 10-15 years we would also be seated (before others)
My advice is don't go
Service is bad, the price is too high for the fare and the music too loud
There are other places in NYC with a much better attitude
Such that don't treat only their 'friends' but also the customers - you know, those who end up paying the bills
On my last visit I enjoyed it as always
Great food good service
Bilboquet is not for everyones so if you are a plouc and dont blend go somewhere else
I found this spot to be such a disappointment
At our tiny table for 4, we were wedged between   1) a large hirsute gentleman who kept his blackberry on the table and kept answering it and 2) three poptart young women who were busting out of their clothes while preening and screeching  I know that some NYers like this scene, but when combined with a rude waiter, the worst bottle of wine I have ever had, overwhelming 70's disco music before 10 and someone who kept fidgeting with the lighting, you have the most ridiculous waste of good money and a good evening
My cajun chicken was chicken breast and fries
Bo-ring
Definitely skip this one
It is all attitude and no grace
This is such a wonderful place
I was amazed that not many people know about this place

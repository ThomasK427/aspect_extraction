The fusilli with chicken and pink sauce was amazing and my boyfriend said the lasagna was better than his mothers, so it HAS to be good
Whats even better is how reasonable it was! I cannot wait to go back!
I just ate at Lasagna for the sixth time, and I have, for the most part, always enjoyed their food
Not every dish is a winner, but there are some great specialties
Their salads are always delicious and fresh (I have tried their House, Arugula, and Chef Salads)
They have very good ravioli (today I had the mushroom, cheese, and crab combination ravioli with alfredo sauce, it was excellent)
I also enjoyed a dish consisting of fetuccini and slices of steak and mushrooms
By far, the best thing about Lasagna is their desserts
Their Tiramisu is to die for! Homemade and always fresh and creamy, it's no wonder why it's been rated one of the best in NY
I personally adore their Tartufo, which tastes absolutely amazing! I sometimes go there just to get a Tartufo to go
Suprisingly, the name doesn't fit
The lasagna portion was small for the price and the taste was mediocre
Service was extremely slow
I think this place has everything I want in an italian restuarant
The food was excellent, I had the osso buco and it rocked
The antipaste was also excellent
The wine list is thorough enough so that you can have the correct drink to complement your meals
The ambiance is great with an outdoor dining area in the middle of the restuarant covered by an awning
A smaller venue, but not quite a hole in the wall joint
Prices are good too, for two people with antipaste, main meal, desert w/coffee and a bottle of wine cost us about $100
I work in midtown and have been to luna piena many times for lunch and dinner
The food never fails to be delicious and the portions are just right
They have the best linguine vongole ever
Service is good
And I love eating in their charming garden when the weather is nice
We went for valentines day and had an incredible meal
The appetizer was great--large porition and delicious
The main courses were both excellent as well
A large, affordable wine list topped off the experience
The back garden atmostphere was very nice and service was good
For a great Italian meal at a very good price, I highly recommend this place
Friendly, knowledgeable staff serving great food and a decent wine list contributed to our pleasant dining experience - we were happy to find this gem of a restaurant after walking the surrounding neighborhood on a  recent Friday evening
Everything about this place had charm - the lovely garden, the incredibly gracious staff and the delicious food
Do not really understand the previous poster's negativity
We sat in the garden and received the best service of any restaurant I had been in a while
My husband got the sole special which was incredible and so fresh, and the rest of us got pasta which was also fresh and tasty
After reading all the great reviews of this restaurant, I was very disappointed with both the food and service
The fried calamari was rubbery, the bread was stale and the pasta was just so-so
There was also a very unpleasant odor permeating the air during our meal
Anyway, as a whole, this restaurant isn't terrible, but it's by no means anything special
or any great bargain, either
Four of us went for a Tuesday dinner
The menu choice was a bit thin, but there was enough variety to choose from
The food was reasonably priced and above average, the staff was wonderful and was eager to please, and the decor is charming and comfortable
I would definitely go back, especially when the warm weather arrives and the garden is open to seating
We went on Wednesday night and had a great dining experience
The appetizers were amazing (big portions) and the service was friendly
I highly recommend the Tropicale salad and the Proscuitto w/ mozzarella appetizers
It's hard to find an affordable, yet great restaurant in this area, but we finally found one
I will definitely go back!
Have been once on Thursday evening, great food, great service in a beautiful garden behind the restaurant
Definitively worth to go for some romantic dinner l'Italienne
so nice place!
Suzu is by far the best value for sushi in the east 50's if you want a nice meal
The portions are big, the food is fresh and the service is consistently friendly and good
The value is great as well! Seems people are starting to discover it, so go there now
Yum!
I love sushi and I can't help every time I want to go out I want to go there
The place doesn't smell fish at all
Great for delivery ,too
Food comes right the way
Highly recommended
The Upper East Side is filled with endless Northern Italian canteens: white table cloths, waiters-in-aprons-with-neckties-tucked-into-their-shirts and parmagean/salami comp plates
This place has all of this but avoids being tired or predictable
The manager (Brad) keeps a careful watch on everything and everyone
Judging from the high maintenance, repeat neighborhood clientele his efforts definitely succeed
Excellent, friendly bar, as well
Good for those who find its sister restaurant Primola too crowded and noisy
I've been going to Ariyoshi for about 7 years now
It's definitely one of the best restaurants in the Long Island City area
Most of the appetizers are great (make sure to try the Geso!) and the entrees are delicious and have generous portions-So you'll never leave this place hungry! The staff are also super nice :) This is one of my favorite restaurants!
The owner has changed and this place is no longer the same
The food is not as good, and now they have TVs playing Japanese TV videos
nothing offensive, but it detracts from the what little atmosphere they had
If you want to eat authentic and refined izakaya Japanese food this is the place on Manhattan
Not another fusion sushi joint catering to yuppies after Asian exotica--95% of the customers here are Japanese living in NYC, who come to Ariyoshi to relax and have home-style cooking
Fresh ingredients make for a varied daily menu, but it's best to bring a Japanese friend to help with the selecting, since the Japanese-language menu makes a lot more sense than the English version
The cooks are from South of the border just like everywhere else, but quality-control by the exacting chef is perfect
This is not a trendy place, it is where you go to have high quality Japanese food in a relaxed atmosphere with friends or with your existing girlfriend/boyfriend
I eat here a lot
here is the low down
Its an older crowd wearing sport coats
YOU dont have too as far as i know, but thats the scene
When I go I dont wear one and they dont say anything
NOW if you like old fashioned and clarinet music and dont mind and over 60 crowd which me 31 does not mind sometimes this is the place for YOU
Great food, great service and wonderful entertainment by who i think is the owner
We just moved into the neighborhood and this place is virtually next door to us
So, we decided to try it the other night not expecting anything but a nearby, OK Italian meal
What a surprise! First off, the restaurant is a pretty, understated room that has a very comfortable feel
Then, the comfort level continues to rise when your waiter and waitstaff begin to serve you
They are professional, pleasant and very efficient
And, when the food comes out, you're in for another surprise! It's delicious! The best carpaccio plate I've ever had, a duck special and orichiette with veal sausage were all top-drawer! Deserts are a little on the standard side (tira mi su, Italian cheesecake) but, overall, the meal, service and ambience were terrific! Oh, by the way! There's great easy-listening music provided by Sol Yaged to round out the experience
What a package!
Gene's Coffeeshop is a classic coffeeshop and diner
They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner
Their breakfast menu included all types of eggs, pancakes, french toast, belgian waffles, with sides a variety of typical breakfast side orders (home fries, toast, muffins, cereal, etc)
They also feature a bakery with an assortment of cakes, bread, muffins, doughnuts, danishes, and other pastries
During my visit, I ordered breakfast
I was seated immediately
My food came within five minutes of my order: hot and as I had requested

Had a reservation for 8 of us on Sat
nite at 6:30
Although we had a 1/2 hr
even with our reservation, it was worth wait
Food was excellent and prices were very reasonable for NYC
In Short In a homey, retro corner spot, with big, inviting windows and neon signage, this quiet cantina serves hefty burritos, enchiladas and the like to an enthusiastic clientele
The burritos and enchiladas each come with half a dozen choices of filling, including chili verde, chipotle shrimp and several vegetarian options
A variety of other entrees include tamales with various fillings, and huachinango Veracruz, a snapper filet with a piquant tomato sauce
Desserts include coconut flan and brownies
Do not order food delivered to your house or apartment from Lupe's
They will skip your order, then lie to you that they rang your doorbell and called your phone number
I just had this happen and I will no longer order from Lupe's
The food may be good, but if they don't or won't bring it to you, how can you tell?
This place was a true find! The food is incredible and very reasonably priced
It's never been crowded when I have been there and it's a cute place on a corner for great people-watching
I recommend the black bean burrito and their super vegetarian burrito is killer!
very friendly wait staff, fun quaint little Mexican diner type place where you can get a great quick Mexican meal
Great place to stop for a quick filling meal when walking around SoHo
Very fresh ingredients, hearty meal, good bang for the buck
the huevos rancheros was very good
don't forget cash only
hi! i love this mexican place
i normally am averse to mexican food since so many dishes consist of onions but not here- the salad is so savory! i get really excited when richard brings me here!
This is one of my FAVORITE places for the food and the atmosphere at lunchtime
However, be very wary of ordering delivery
My order has never come right and it's often ice cold
Mind you, I still keep trying
I am from Southern California and have scoured New York to find Mexican food similar to the type served on the left coast
I was elated when I found Lupe's
If one is looking for L
A
Style Mexican food (which I consider to be real Mexican food) then go to Lupe's
I had the steak burrito which is served with Mexican rice and lettuce and tomato on the side
It's nothing to look at, but the taste is authentic
If one is familiar with Chano's or El Coyote in Los Angeles then expect the same quality and flavor
Don't go for the decor or the location, go for the food!
I really love the food at Lupe's
Nice solid Mexican that reminds me of food I have had in Southern California
It isn't much to look at though and I wouldn't take someone I was trying to impress with there
I would reccomend it to my less pretentious acquiantances though
Just don't bring your date to this cheap looking restaurant on the border of SOHO and the West Village
The Food is fine, but the decor reminds you why NYC is such a great place to live
The food is adequate, authentic and inexpensive, but this is a glorified Mexican Diner
Not a good place to go out with a group
Only regular margaritas (no frozen
can't you buy a blender?), beer and low-grade wine
The same waiter can be friendly, absent-minded or bitter, all within the span of an hour
If you're local, try it, but it's not worth going out of your way for
granted, it's a small place and gets packed for lunch but this place delivers
i always order the enchilada suaza
it's the best!!
Especially if you find yourself in the neighborhood of the Knitting Factory--and hungry--fairly often, Lupe's is a godsend
Hefty portions of L
A
-style Mexican food, plus a great selection of Mexican beers (and margaritas!) complete the picture
The Scene At this busy Chinatown destination, the peach-painted dining room is packed most nights with groups of noodle-slurping neighborhood teens and families
Get your order in fast; service is brusque, and niceties such as water refills tend to be ignored
The Food Half the Vietnamese menu is taken up by variations on pho, Vietnam's popular beef noodle soup
Go for the fiery, sweet-sour shrimp soup, packed with chunks of okra, pineapple and shrimp, flanked with starter plates like fat nuggets of grilled beef rolled in lettuce with rice noodles, crackling-hot, greaseless spring rolls or cool, crunchy rice-paper summer rolls
At $4 for a big bowl (or $4
95 for a huge one), the Pho Bang does offer bang for the buck; too bad the watery broth's missing the deep, star-anise perfume that characterizes the dish at its best
This place is a great find, I've been coming here for years
Awesome Vietnamese food - love the beef/lettuce/rice noodles app, sauteed shrimp, scallops and calamari over noodles, bun, everything
(The salty lemonade is interesting, worth checking out!)
Service is fine and low-maintenance decor is charming
The prices are unbelievable; have a feast for 2 for the prices that some places charge for an entree! I always leave here content - full on amazing food and pleased at having spent so little money on it! My husband didn't like the food the 1st time I took him but the last time I did he found an entree he liked and is now mightily impressed with this place
This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in New York City
The pho is great and you can have it so many ways
The deep, star-anise perfume mentioned in the editorial article
This person is definately not from Vietnam and knows nothing about real Pho
The service is great (the waiters remember my usual order and that I like my bean sprouts blanched)
My favorite appetizers include the grilled beef bun hoi or rice noodle wrap and the grilled pork topped on prawn chips
The grilled shrimp with cold rice noodles is also good and of course the grilled pork chop over rice is delicious
You will not believe your check when you finish your meal
Great prices with large portions is what makes this place the restaurant I go to at least once a week
This restaurant is THE favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the whole city of mine and my husband's
Perhaps not for a romantic occasion, but if sure makes up for that with its spacious accommodations, polite service and generous helpings -- and if you are with friends that you want to sit with for a long time, or simply enjoy an unhurried, delicious meal for GOOD price
Highly recommended!
For the weight conscious folks, try the vietnamese chicken salad
(#36 or 37 on the menu)
A greaseless, crispy, zesty, dieter's delight consisting of finely shredded cabbage and lettuce, doused with shredded chicken breast, peanuts, and the signature vietnamese sweet/sour sauce
Served cold
Yum!!
while the atmosphere is a little sparse and makes one think of street cafe's in Asia the food is reliably good and the restaurant is clean
Also, the variety of Vietnamese dishes (while slightly limited) is good if you stick to the specialtys (you don't order steak in McDonnalds do you) so stick with the Pho, the Ban Cun, Ban Tap, and most of the roast (pork/beef/shrimp) over noodles - dishes are authentic
a big bowl of pho complete with all sorts of beef parts and noodles for a mere 5 bucks is better than anything
pho sho is good!!
If u are looking for a quick and good bowl of noodles in soup this is the place to go
No decor , no good service, just food
pork chop over rice is good too!
Great food
Great coffee
Good service
A place you take your adventurous friends to impress them
Worth the trip -- excellent pork fried rice and grilled pork over rice noodles
yummy!!!
Been there many times but lately I had went back there to try out their wonton noodles
At one point I felt that the portions were just too little for what I'm paying for
So I stopped going but then the food there had improved
The wonton noodles are sastifying, fried dumplings maybe too much dough but still ok

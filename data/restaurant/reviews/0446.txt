The pulled pork is just sloppy fun
From Kyle, the Manager, to Todd, the Customer Service Manager, to the rest of the staff, they make you feel like family (A family that serves great food)
Its easy to fall in love with this place, fast service and definitely praise-worthy BBQ food
The burgers are delicious, the ribs are yummy, and the steaks are full of flavor
The atmosphere is decent, plenty of ample space and comfy seating to get accustomed to
Sadly, all of this comes at a price, a high one that may not be worth paying for
My delicious cheese burger was easily $13 and the steak was close to $35
My shake was $8 even
I was not impressed with anything i ordered; quantity, price or taste
The only thing that saved the nite was the service -attentive and quick, but that was pretty much the only highlite of this restaurant
Would not recommend it
We have been to Blue smoke many times and we keep going back
We love it
To begin with the service is excellent
Because we have been there a number of time we have a number of favorites
The pulled pork platter, the pulled pork sandwich, the beef brisket sandwich (great to share the two sandwiches with someone), mac and cheese and the fried chicken
Even though they are known for there ribs, I believe the other items are a better bet, esp
if you only get to go once and a while
Great ending
the choc
cake
I gotta say that this place had some solid BBQ, which is tough to find in nyc
The prime rib was very well made with a nice tangy sauce on the top
I recommend the mussells to start with the hot sauce
The only weird thing I noticed, was when we asked for bread to soak up all the juices of the mussells, they gave us Wonder bread
Good selection of beers on the menu and a good place for groups! I'd go back if I'm ever in the area again
The wings are wonderful, and when the ribs aren't dry (it's hit or miss here), they're great too
But the service stinks, including the rude and clueless hosts
The place seems to be swarming with help, yet it takes forever to get a waiter back to the table
And when I was seated in a major foot traffic area, every single waiter and busboy made it a point to bump my chair and never apologize
Poor training
I disagree with juanbobo1
I used to work at a BBQ rib place, so I consider myself a fairly good judge of pork ribs
I had their ribs and they were out of this world
I recommend the St
Louis style
The rack I had was tender and not too grissly
We arrived and the hostess estimated 30 minutes for our party of 4
We were seated in 15 minutes
I agree with juan that the cheese fries are nothing to write home about
But the ribs
Definitely some of the better ribs I've had
Our waiter was also very friendly and helpful
Blue Smoke is the most overrated barbecue place
Although we confirmed the number of our party (six) several times, the table was only set for five
The server spilled beer on the table when he poured it; he dropped ice cubes for another one of our guests and water everywhere else
He also forgot about two of our side orders, one after the other
The music was inconsistent
One minute the restaurant put on jazz, another, it blasted Faith Evans and Outkast; and then, house
You then have the pleasure of hearing the same soundtrack all over again
You'll enjoy better (read: juicier) barbecue at Brother Jimmy's or Houston's--and at lower prices
Blue Smoke may be the most casual eatery out of the Union Square Hospitality Group, but if Danny Meyer is putting his stamp on it, the service should be at par with his other restaurants
Ok for those of you who know BBQ, will know that this is not the place for you
All the food tastes of the fake liquid smoke that many restaurants use in place of actually smoking their meats
The mac and cheese tastes like velveeta, the corn bread tastes like it came right out of boxed mix
Sorry to say melting a single slice of kraft cheese on top of fries does not allow you to sell them as cheese fries
All in all there are far better BBQ places in the city
Great barbeque
Pulled pork is fantastic and I highly recommend 3 sausage sampler appetizer
Service is quick and the food is even quicker
$60 for 2 with 1 drink each and 1 appetizer shared
large portions so unless you are of large stature you should not get 2 appetizers
Kitchen can get jammed and you should find out when that happens (expecially if you are a large group of 5+)
evertying on the menu is so tasty
I went to the restaurant because their name were mentioned on Today Show
I tried the sampler plates
The beef ribs were very dried to the point of beef jerky
The pork ribs were not bad
Also the salt and pepper beef ribs were also dried
I was very disappointed
Would not come back again or recommend to anyone
Okay, I can't argue with the food, it was good
I just don't get the growing trend in BBQ restaurants to make it more than it is
I love BBQ and have been eating it for years, when did it stop getting served on styrofoam plates though? The ribs were great, of course a Danny Meyer restaurant has good service, and the room very comfortable with some great smoky smells
But when I think BBQ, this is not the vision I see, a little more roadside looking would bring more authenticity to it, but I can't put down the food
Just wondering when some of those ingredients became part of BBQ?
I made a reservation, got there early, confirmed my reservation while waiting for the rest of my party, and yet they gave away my table even though the rest of my party arrived on time
There were three hostesses working and all of them seemed clueless as to why/ how this happened
When we were finally seated about half an hour after my reservation, the waitress took her time taking our order
Thankfully, the food was served promptly
Overall, the food was alright, but the service was poor
yes there's better bbq in other areas of the country
this is one of the best bbq's i've had in nyc
had the rib sampler
large portions of ribs and was serviced by a kind waitress
like the fact restaurant isn't trendy (not like l
e
s or meat-packing district trendy)
took my friends from tx and they loved it
I have had much better barbque in other parts of the country, and for the prices they charge you would think it should great
The ribs were small with little meat on them
The place is cool but the food is average for being one of the top ranked bbque places in the city
The wait was forever
Fast, friendly, knowledgeable staff
The Kansas City ribs and mac cheese are to die for
The smoked chicken was so-so
Overall a great experience, it is a fun spot, and very reasonably priced
The waitress was bubbly and took our order right away
When the food arrived, I was so hungry I'd have eaten nearly anything -- but, this food was inedible
The baby back ribs were cold and tasteless, the macaroni and cheese tasted funny (like the cheese had gone bad), the potatoes were very good, and, the hush puppies were hot and pretty tasty

A wonderful dining experience with good food, excellent wine (with a large by the glass selection), a pleasant ambience and superb, friendly service
Even the people who checked coats were friendly and professional
An overall delightful dining experience
Went to Eleven Madison Park for restaurant week
The ambience is very nice: an ENORMOUS room with cool 1940s elements
sort of reminded me of the hotel in the Shining
The food was decent but didn't blow me away or anything
Maybe I should try going there when they aren't trying to mass produce everything for such a huge crowd
it was terrific! the portions were good-sized, the sauces were very flavorful, and all the waitstaff and hostesses were polite and unpretentious-- which is *key* when you don't understand strange words on the menu that basically mean 'chicken' in other languages
good wine selection
go at off-peak times, less crowded and everyone's more relaxed
After having been seated, we had to wait around for the waiters to switch shifts before we could place our order
Our meal was acceptable, but highly over rated
We also had issues with our meal that have yet to be resolved
Numerous calls and messages for the management have gone ignored and frankly I am outraged by their apparent lack of concern for their patrons
I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone
As usual, the space is amazing and the ambiance is lovely to match
Got a table during restaurant week for lunch and the service was cordial, if slower than usual
The food seems to have suffered a bit in terms of execution - low flavor and sometimes dry or overdone (we're attributing it to the large crowds for restaurant week)
The muscadet we had was very low quality for an establishment that serves such a nice selection
Desserts were excellent
Had this been my first time here, I'd probably not return for the food
However, we know they're usually better than this, so we'll probably be back to use the $20
03 vouchers they so kindly presented all their guests
Third time I've eaten here in the last year or so and never fails to impress
From the opening cheese puffs to a beautiful sweetbread appetizer to a well-executed duck breast, fantastic
Friendly staff although service was slightly a little slower than expected
And of course the room is great
It's a lovely space
My family and I celebrated my 50th birthday here
The food was mostly good, though not nearly as good as I've had at Union Square Cafe or Gramercy Tavern
Three dishes came with unbelievably raw fingerling potatoes
Though the wait staff was attentive, when the raw (really, not al dente) potatoes were brought to our server's attention, she listened but didn't respond
No replacement vegetable was offered
So it was a mostly good, but not fantastic experience, especially given the cost
Everything about this place works especially the service
Very friendly and informed
After our meal the chef came to our table as he was doing a lap around the dining room and visited each table
Food was excellent
Will be back
I've loved this restaurant for dinner, and lunch yesterday was a wonderful experience too
The room works so well in day time, the large windows allowing for a beautiful view over Madison Park
The skate was divine, presented with spinach, caramelized cauliflower and baby potatoes
Desserts must not be skipped! the almond tart with caramelized pineapple was so delicious! The service is perfect without being stuffy, and our sommelier was very open to our unwillingness to go with his recommendations
After trying our selection (a Montlouis from the Loire Valley), he agreed that it was a good choice
Eleven Madison is great for a romantic dinner, business lunch, or dinner with friends, or a glass of wine at the bar
Despite our confirmed reservations being lost on a high-traffic evening, the host was apologetic and courteous enough to seat us promptly
The wait service was less than what I expected, but they are knowledgeable about their dishes down to each ingredient
We ordered the Cotes du Beouf, which only comes in servings for 2, and we were in complete rapture over that meat: juicy, loaded with flavors and the meat on the bone for leftovers were TO DIE FOR!
I've been there a few times already and everything's always great -service,food,and service
Never disappointing
We were disappointed with so-so food and rude service
Our waitress left halfway through dinner, without explanation, and was replaced by another waiter
The sommelier was the worst -- unbelievably condescending and obnoxious
When asked about a section of the wine list containing reasonably priced wines, and he picked the one bottle that was priced well over (as in double) the rest
I chose a nice syrah, but he brought the wrong vintage -- a year younger
After 10 minutes of waiting, he finally returned to the table and snootily explained to us that the wine he had opened was actually better and more expensive (not yet on the menu, of course), but he would charge us the price of the bottle we had originally ordered
Yeah, thanks a lot
For the amount we spent on dinner, there are many other places with better food and more gracious service
Very good food
Very good service
The high ceilings gives it a very airy quality
good-looking crowd
This must be one of the best restaurants I've ever been to
Great service and they catered to our large group well
Beautiful restaurant
You can't go wrong at this spot
high ceilings, great atmosphere
interesting and reliable menu
Good for large groups and small
Try the chocolate soufflee (order it when you sit down, it takes awhile)
YOU WILL THINK YOU ARE IN HEAVEN!
I was treated to a surprise birthday party on a Saturday night
The reservations were for 10, but 13 showed up
The host accommodated us without batting an eye
Food was scrumptous
The cassoulet, lamb and hangar steaks were the big hits
The chocolate souffle dessert was devine
The atmosphere is airy
The pace is unrushed; we stayed 3 + hours
I would recommend this restaurant for either an intimate dinner for two or a special occasion for a big party
They can do it all
I have been here several times and the food is ok, but not great
Nice, open contemporary space though
Service is also fairly consistent
I like restaurants with a bar
I always prefer to dine at the bar, if given the option
Cal's has always been a natural favorite for that reason
Cal's best kept secret: Delivery
Same food, same portions, 40% off in-house prices
Cal's cuisine has been consistently delicious and unique everytime I've tried it
The duck and liver risottos are a must if you're daring
Although the dining room is expansive and nice to look at, the room became loud during dinner
The food was nothing spectacular
I was surpised that my skirt steak special was more like a salad with a couple of slices of skirt steak on top
The steak was good but nothing great
Wouldn't go back where there are so many GREAT restaurants in NY
Overpriced as well
Service was very slow and NOT attentive
bartender was, well, on the rude side

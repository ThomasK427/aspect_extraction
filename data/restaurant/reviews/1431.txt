Sooooooo, we will be back for the brunch again
I truly hated this place
We bonded with the table next to us because everything that could go wrong, did
First off - the hostess tells everyone the wait is 15 minutes, which is an utter lie as we waited at LEAST half hour
When we finally got our table, we were seated upstairs in the (over-heated, stuffy, cramped) room
It took at least half hour to get our salads (which don't even need to be cooked!) which were not all that good, and way too expensive for what it was
not recommended at all
Just got back from the WWE Monday Night Raw party at the recently opened Big Daddy's Diner on Park Avenue South
What an experience! The food was great, but was pleasantly overshadowed by the rabid atmosphere of NYC's wrestling fanatics
Every Monday and Friday night BDD hosts an event for wrestling die-hards, like myself, chockfull of soup, salad, and suplexes
The waiters, dressed in full wrestling garb, periodically put on exhibitions and the patrons in attendance share the same fervor
What a night! I highly recommend this new restaurant to all NYC foodies who have been sole searching since WWF zone closed down in Times Square

This was one of the worst dining experiences I;ve ever had
The waitress came out with EVERYONE'S order wrong! There were three of us
So, she brought out the new dishes one at a time
about 10 minutes apart each, so we were all eating cold eggs by the time we got our food
Then she forgot my drink, and the bill didn't add up at the end
she had charged us for several things that we didn't get
not only did she not apologize, but she seemed annoyed when I asked her to change it
I've worked at restaurants my whole life
The 24-hr bistro up the block is a million times better
I went to Big Daddy's diner with two of my kids and we all had a great time
The atmosphere is cool and the people even cooler- I felt like a hip, young Mom at the place to be
Everyone was super friendly and great with the kids
The mini burgers were a terrific appetizer for all of us- I actually loved the tater tots more than the kids
I had a huge salad that was fantastic (the kitchen sink) and my kids had pancakes and milkshakes- they felt like they were at a party, with the crayons, music, awesome decor- I couldn't have had a more enjoyable meal with a rowdy 3 and 5 year old
Can't wait to go back with some grownups and have a couple of beers and the Big Daddy Burger!
Went to Big Daddy's for brunch with friends on Sunday
Wow is about it
Everything was fantastic
We ordered some salads, which were delicious, but when we tasted the pancakes with caramelized bananas, all diets were off and we got sandwiches and eggs benedict and of course you HAVE to try the shakes made with Haagen Daz
Even the bagel and lox platter was amazing
The fries went in seconds and the tater tots brought back thoughts of home
To me, the test of a good diner is the tuna and the tuna here was terrific
Burgers were all done just right too
The staff was friendly and quick when we wanted quick and slow when we needed slow
Prices are excellent for a NY brunch too
The decor is great too
very retro
We all plan to be regulars, it was the kind of fun morning Sunday should be
I can't begin to describe how bad this place is
Decor is great, very cute (albeit unoriginal), but the food was TERRIBLE and outrageously priced
I had a cheeseburger that tasted like it'd been cooked 6 hours ago and then reheated in the microwave (although the fries were good)
It was the driest, most tasteless piece of meat I've ever eated
Was beyond well-done when I ordered medium well
Although it was not crowded when we went, the waitress rushed us through our meal
I decided to pass on the $6 milkshake and $10 desserts
since when is a diner priced so ridiculously, even if it is on Park Ave
South???
Dinner here on Saturday night was wonderful
I had the mussels followed by a leg of lamb followed by the creme brulee! Portion sizes were just right
The restaurant was cozy and everyone was very welcoming
Would definitely return here
We have been visiting 'The Place' on West 4th street for the past 8 years and have never been dissapointed, -We have taken well travelled friends, co,workers and family there over the years, and not one of our guests have ever found fault with it
- We have visited the new location 'The Place on W10th 4 times in the past 3 weeks since it opened, and found it even surpasses the perfection of the original
- I have never written an online comment about a venue before - but having read the disgruntled comment of one of your contributors, which I have to say is totally un-believable - I have to write WELL DONE 'The Place' - each visit is memorable and delicious - you also donate 10% of your profits to charity
Thank you
From the moment our party of 6 friends walked into this wecoming new warm and cozy spot, we were greeted and treated with enthusiasm and hospitality
from drinks at the bar, to our perfect round table! Ordering beautifully presented appetizers (mine a mouthwatering, sensory titillating duck confit) to entrees (mine the savory Sea Bass)
me, leisurely tasting other's pastas and beef
which was succulent and healthy perfection on a plate
To our absolutely divine and sublime desserts (yes, I had to have the chocolate cake
) our group was sated and quite wonderfully taken care of
every single detail attended to
Aplomb and finesse
Professional and kind wait staff, Incredible Menu presentations! Such care, such an aromatic delectable dining experience!
Nothing has really changed inside and even the table layout remains the same
The one thing that has changed is the food - MUCH worse
The scallops were not fresh, the chicken poorly cooked and tasteless and the steak was fatty
The wine slection was poor and the price in range with much better Places in the hood
Anyone interested in giving this restaurant odds - I say gone in less than 6 months
It is a shame about the 150 characters, but here goes: I had the most incredible experience at this restaurant
I was there on the third day after it opened
Everything about it was incredible from the moment we walked through the door - ambiance, service, decor, music, and of course, the food and wine
It is both an incredible date place and a place to go with friends
The menu is so creative and reasonable
Guaranteed something for everyone no matter what they like
THIS IS THE PLACE!
I love this place
Whether for lunch or dinner, the food is consistantly well done and the staff is always friendly and accomodating
Definately try the Crispy Spring Rolls, the Coconut Tom Kha Soup, Maekong Aged Pork Chop and any of the Curry dishes! You won't be disappointed
But get there early
The place is small and intimate and the seats go fast! Groups of more than for are not recommended unless you call ahead of time
Otherwise, ENJOY!
Excellent food
Went their for friends birthday
Place was crowded with locals
The service should be improved
The food starting from the appetizer to the desert was served fast, even in a crowded place
I ordered Spice with some coworkers and they accidently delivered a meat entree
As a vegetarian, I could not eat this item
I immediately phoned them to alert the mistake
There was no apology and they said it would take 20 minutes, maybe more
There was no priority for THEIR mistake
I had to call 4 times to inquire the whereabouts of my lunch
They kept saying that it will be there shortly
The food never arrived and after 2
5 hours, I had to call a 5th time and cancel
I spoke with the manager who could only apologize and say that it's difficult today

This place is a bit to expensive
13$ for a large drink
TOo expensive dinners for what they are offereing

But still
Place was great
nice atmosphere! watch a game at the small bar
For 55$ we got 2 drinks and a plate nacho app's and huge pupu platter
expenesive,and they really nice bartender gave us some free shots!
I NEED TO GET THE MIAMI VICE DRINK AGAIN! I WOULD SAY HEY WHY NOT GO! I WILL!
Besides the mediocre service and wobbly tables that you almost come to expect at a tourist attraction, the food was downright awful
Over-seasoned and poor quality fare are all you can expect to be served
Sixteen dollars a plate is not bad, but at first bite, you realize you wouldn't eat this stuff if they gave it out for free
The only reason I tried it was for a maragarita on a hot night
Not worth it
First of all they basically charged us almost double for drinks, charged us $4
00 extra for 2 extra tortillas with our fajitas, the waiter barley spoke english, and the manager has no appreciation for his guests
The customer is always right, is the modo of the restaurant business
But not in this place, they actually argue back at you
Overall a terrible restaurant experience and will never go back!
Went for lunch the bartenders were great, also they had a DJ playing music during the day, there was a Huge screen tv playing music videos and a bunch of other tvs with all the sports you could look at
a great day
at a great place
So I admit, the food's not the greatest
But the margaritas are huge and you get to keep the glass
Also the atmosphere's not bad-- you get to watch sports and music videos while you eat
Oh
and the waitresses are awesome
My first visit to Caliente Cab Co
will surely be my last
It is rare to find service as rude, slow and incompetent as you are sure to find at this culinary mishap
And the food? Forget it
This place makes Chi-Chi's seem like Rosa Mexicano
Most of the entrees feature mushy tortillas, vaguely salty red sauces, plasticky cheese and low-quality, overcooked meats
The frozen drinks are so weak you could serve them at an AA meeting
In short: this place is best left for the NYU freshmen from the 'burbs, as they are likely to be the only ones who won't know how bad it really is
I have never had a worse restaurant experience than the one this weekend at the Caliente Cab Co
The food and drink was way over priced and I even think they screwed with the bill
Not to mention they cleaned the tables with rags and rushed us out as soon as they could
But the worst part of the experience is when I turned my head to talk to a friend and one of the waitstaff took my corona
They saw I was upset and tried to give me someone else's half-full bud light
When asked about it they were extremely rude and would not replace the beer that they took
The manager did little to help the customer either and after dropping $150 in the restaurant, you would think he would
Unbelievable
Oh, and where is the notion,The customer is always right?
God must have created Mexican restaurants late in the evening on the sixth day 'cos there certainly aren't many of them around (and they're virtually non-existent outside the US)
Caliente Cab Co
would probably be lauded from above in London but here in NYC it is merely average
The alarmingly red tortilla chips and tangy salsa were good but the mains can disappoint
The chicken and steak fajitas are reasonable but the shrimp was rubbery and bland
Still, the mango magaritas are enticing as are the people watching opportunities if you choose one of the tables outside
The service was exceptionally slow on a slow night to boot! Food did not satisfy my mexican craving
Bland oversized and overpriced
Mexican should be cheap, greasy and flavorful
Even the margarita was dissapointing
I went to Caliente with a friend and we each got a margarita
it was happy hour, so drinks were half priced, but it still cost $4
Then we ended up splitting an entre because it was like $13 for one entre
I'm from Texas, so I have high standards for my Mexican food, and this was only so-so
I didn't like the rice at all, but the chimichanga was good
I also did like the strawberry margarita
We get a hankerin' for Indian and nothing satisfies like this place
Every time we hit Curry Row we say we are going to try a different restaurant but since we have been in at least 2 others and neither makes my Channa Bhaji like Taj Mahal, we don't risk it
The Vegetable Biryani is yummerific and the Vegetable Pakora are sinfully delicious!
this is a great if not shady restaurant
One meal, including appetizers, main course (one meat, one vegetarian), dessert coffee -- $18 TOTAL FOR TWO PEOPLE
Food was very good to boot - one downside is no liquor license but there is a liquor store next door
Rumor has it that all the Indian restaurants on the South side of East Sixth Street share the same kitchen
It's a decent kitchen, so no one complains
So how do you select one place over another? Some have a sitar player; others flashier decorations
If you're celebrating a birthday, I'd definitely recommend Tajmahal
I don't remember the dessert item but when it was brought out flashing lights overhead threw colored beams on the walls and a young waiter came over to our table and did a little dance that was Bollywood MTV for the East Village set
Lots of sideward pelvic thrusts driven by a Middle Eastern beat and self-admiration in the mirror
The guest of honor laughed herself to tears
We all tipped well
I have had better Burmese but regularly return to this East Village option
The price is good, especially considering the location, the menu has your usual SE Asian options, and the vegetarian dishes go over big with some of my yoga friends
The food is fine
Of all the options, I enjoyed the squid salad the first time I got it but not the second time
Always, however, I love the green tea salad
Some of the tofu dishes are consistently good, too, as are also the ones with the mango relish
Some of the most generous portions - especially the lunch specials - I've found in New York, quick service, and consistently *pretty* good
That $2 side of coconut rice is a welcome addition to any meal; I also like the banana dessert
It's cheap and filling food, but it's often greasy (at least some of the noodle dishes and the thousand-layer pancake) and it doesn't always taste fresh
My Rangoon Night Noodles were covered with garlic that was unappetizingly burnt
I don't know if this is a clash of cultural palettes, or if it was poorly prepared, but I ended up flicking a lot of them away
everyone on a budget in nyc knows that finding a place to grab lunch under $10 is pretty hard unless you want fast food
their daily lunch special from 11-4:30 is a great deal
you get soup/salad w/ and entree and rice for $4
95
me and my friend go at least once a week, order 2 lunch specials (enough for 3 people) and are stuffed
havent tried many things on the menu bc i'm hooked on the beef curry w/ potatoes and the chili chicken w/ vegetables (really spicy! yum)
try it out!
I've been going to this restaurant for 2 years and the food blows me away every time! Whenever my family comes to visit me, this is where we go! We love the flavorful and unique dishes and friendly service
I order take out from this place at least once a week! It's great for the health consious because they use a wonderful variety of vegetables and very little fat
The chicken is always all white meat
I can't wait to eat here again!
I wasn't blown over by the food here--it was on the greasy side, over-salted, and didn't have a lot of spice or kick (the beef curry I ordered could have been my mom's beef stew if it wasn't for the sprinkling of coriander leaves on top
) The food didn't seem to have a distinct character--it made me think of underassertive Thai or even Indonesian food
However, they do bring you a lot of food for your buck, and despite the unremarkable food it strikes me as a good place to fill up on the cheap for lunch or after a night of drinking

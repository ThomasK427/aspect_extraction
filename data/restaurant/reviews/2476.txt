My gazpacho was light with a perfect blend of spices in a watermelon base, perfect fare to cool down on a hot night
The Chilean sea bass entre was one of the best I've had
Although the restaurant is not recommended for children, the children we encountered near our table were well behaved--kudos to the considerate parents who bring their children here
The people that work at this restaurant are plain old rude and not nice
I would not recommend this place to my enemies
The hostess was friendly, informative and was able to gauge the wait time for a brunch table accurately
Food was yummy, and the service was pleasant and timely
A great place to while away a Sunday afternoon - the best Columbus Avenue brunch venue
The service was snotty and the food was completely overrated
I have no clue why this place is rated so high
Trust me, there are much better places in New York City to go to brunch
Isabella's has the best brunch on the Upper West Side
I'm not sure why CitySearch has it as four dollar signs; at brunch most dishes are under $10
There is a lot of variety and everything is delicous
The decore is perfect
Isabella's is also one of the most famous restaurants in New York, featured in Woody Allen movies and Seinfeld
I also love the location - perfect for a walk in central park after brunch
Great place, good ambiance, good food, decent service
and a GREAT PRICE! I would take a girlfriend there but not for a date
The ambiance is nice but there's just too many single 40-old's around
Food is great and portions are big for NY standards
Took my girlfriend their for her birthday and it was great
Great servers, great food, wonderful drinks and great value
Parking we lucked out on (right in front of the place)
If you can, cab it
Saves you alot of headache
Food was delicious
The Salmon was out of this world
Go with a group so you can taste a little bit of everything on the menu
My wife and I ate at Isabella's with another couple this past 4th of July weekend
We all had a fish dish
Nothing spectacular
So so food
You pay for the nice Mediterranean ambiance and decor
Most NYers were out of town so there was no wait and the place was not very busy
However the wait staff was very slow and inattentive
In fact we ended up spending 4 hours there for dinner and skipped the rest of our evening plans
I'm sure if they were busy we would have been rushed out sooner
Bill was $40 per person
If you're looking for a class and elegance without paying a fortune, Isabella's is it! Situated in a lovely neighborhood, sit inside or out and people-watch while enjoying a great brunch menu, sipping on Mimosas
it doesn't get much better than this
It's very Sex the Cityish
The only downside is the long wait
I've been here a few times, its pretty boring/standard
Had the sea bass risotto a few days ago, it was totally average
I could understand the appeal of this place when there used to be no good restaurants on the UWS, but now there are choices, so why bother unless you don't feel like looking into anything new?
isabella's is one of my favorite places to eat and spend time w/ friends
the crabcake sandwich was great
omelette was a bit bland
but the overall ambiance and setting was cozy, modern, bright and active all at the same time
i'm going to be a regular at this place!
To my surprise, they had great food
I had seared rare tuna as appetizer and grilled salmon with mushroom risotto as entre
I also had a sundae brownie for desert
Everything was excellent for the reasonable price they had
I'd recommend this place to my friends
I also heard that their brunch is quite good
Nice service also
Don't come here during peak hours, as you'll be left waiting quite a while for your food
This is a great place for a late lunch or early dinner
The food is great and the salads are all tasty
I enjoyed my experience here and would go back if I were ever in the neighborhood
Isabella's is a cozy, quiet restaurant
A good date place
The menu is kinda on the pricey side, for my budget anyway
but, the food is well worth it
I tried almost everything on the menu, but my fav is the pumkin raviloi, too bad it's only seasonal
they are the best!
kitchen doesn't accomodate reasonable requests, restaurant is in total chaos during sunday brunch (due to poor management), and waiters bug guests for their email addresses so that restaurant can send out mass mailings
not a place to bring kids (only grilled cheese is available), and good luck trying to make a phone reservation - you'll likely be put on hold forever
did i mention there were fruit flies all over the restaurant on both of my visits?
Nice menu
OK food
Great outdoor space for a nice summer evening date and people watching
Give me a very generous plate of potatoes and crabcake eggs benedict
Preceed it with strawberry spread and warm raisin bread, a brunch cocktail
and a seat next to Gene Hackman
Yes, folks!
But Beware, while the food and company is affordable be prepared to pay in exchange: your ego for a NYC style Isabella's brunch
You will be unrecoginzed, the hostesses are bitchy (B) and the crowd bitchier
The staff, including the managers (must exclude the couple very good people on the wait staff) is rude
rude and on a Sunday at 1pm you will wait up to 80 minutes for a table!!! But, hey
bring your good company, eat a great meal, drink a bloodymary
and, sit outside, people watch and catch some sun
Gene Hackman, he does
Great place for brunch and al fresco dining
watch out for hordes on weekends
Have been there several times (convenient to NY Historical Society) and always enjoyed dinner
Excellent bread with white bean spread or olive oil, great pasta and fish dishes, great desserts
Took a friend once who also enjoyed it and wanted to return
The Scene The front room, which holds deli cases of smoked salmon, caviar and whitefish salad, is slammed on Sunday afternoons with Upper West Siders and their wee tykes waiting for a table
Past the entrance area, the narrow 73-year-old dining room--humbly furnished with tightly packed Formica wood-grain tables and matching wainscoting--eases the commotion a notch
The Food You can bury your lox in an omelette, or savor it with one of the restaurant's fabulous smoked fish platters--served with two bagels or bialys, slabs of cream cheese, slices of tomato and sweet onion, and potato salad or coleslaw
Silken Nova Scotia salmon makes your bagel a beautiful thing; the drier, saltier pastrami lox, fringed in black, offers an equally pleasing variation
The kitchen's superb matzo ball soup pairs a flavorful broth with a perfectly fluffy matzo ball
While there were real chunks of lox in the lox, onion and egg scramble, the portion was tiny for the price
Have had much better similar breakfasts for much less
Won't go again
But the portions will leave you a bit hungry when you leave
But the quality of the smoked fish still justifies it's cost

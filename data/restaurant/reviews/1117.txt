The soups are a little hit-and-miss and the music is just terrible--awful elevator/supermarket muzak
Atmosphere isn't bad, but could use just a little touch-up
Super nice wait staff
Their delivery is amazing as well--always prompt! Terrific value
This place is great for finding those hard to find organic items
The only problem is their loud mouth deli guy that bothers everyone
He may think he's funny and being charming
Not so much
So if you can block him out while getting your produce, I recommend this place
Surprisingly inventive (not to mention large) sandwiches at this bright, clean modern deli
Daily (largely veggie) options are posted atop the deli counter - and are well worth the embarrassment of askig for a 'shrek' or a 'donkey'
Waited for over an hour for food to arrive - we were one of four tables
All three courses (soup, appetizer and entree) were then brought at the same time
Food was comical in that is smelled and tasted like dog food and had obviously just come out of the microwave
Service was obnoxious and practically non-existant
Bad service! We waited an hour for our appetizers, (I suspect the waitress forgot to put in our order because the restaurant was not busy) and then the entrees came at the same time! The food was microwaved! Terrible
step inside this well hidden alcove on grand ave
in Brooklyn, NY where the music soothes and the aromas tittilate all five senses
The food is ethnically rich and flavorfull, but moderately priced and well portioned
The staff is amiable and relaxed
The Teusday night Jazz is seductively addictive, and catchy
Come once and you'll come again
Perfect for the family or the local Pratt student
I happened upon this place when my other favorite was closed and was not disappointed
The owner makes you feel like family and the food is out of this world
Their pastels are excellent and make you want more
The drinks are ok, not the best bartender, but the food and the ambience are great
If you are a soccer fan, watch your games there, you won't regret it! The lamb yassa is some of the best I've had on this continent
My wife and I had a fantastic dinner there recently
Incredibly fresh red snapper stands out -- but the whole menu is interesting and appealing
Great service in a truly unique atmosphere
The kind of place where you know you'll be a regular
Has a great neighborhood vibe
Very Clinton Hill
It's casual, fun and hasa menu with exotic dishes and dishes for those who don't want to branch out
Cozy, open space
Great for a group
Sit in the back near the windows on the corner of Grand and Clifton
Not too many restaurants in NYC I love
I go to Raoul's, Daniel, SOHO House and Bond Street
Now Milieu
I just know what I like
A client called a sensitive/potentially volatile meeting
I intended on SOHO House, but he couldn't go far, so I took a chance on Milieu
Amazing! Clean lines, tropical, placid and sublime
The furniture space have the sensibilities of 1930s Italian minimalism
Instantly my client relaxed
Staff was on the mark
Our waiter knew his game
He was professional, genuinely caring
Excellent was food! Fresh, layered with flavor
The bottle of wine we shared the owner him self provided
Though each different, Milieu will hang with the establishments mentioned
Hats off to the chef!  I got a peak of the upstairs lounge
Remember Momba? You know B8
Thats the feeling I got, just more intimate
I am back in my client's good graces!
This is the hottest new place in the city
I went with my friends after hearing about it in the 601 building (between 11th and 12th on 26th street)
Not only was our meal excellent
The service was great and i felt like i was on a cruise ship
The employees are positive and the overall vibe there is like being on Vacation
DId i mention that its the only place to get a great meal and then leave with a Starbucks
Yes folks, they have a mini Starbucks at the bar
Im not kidding
**** stars for Milieu
In Short The soothing, leafy backyard garden and main dining room with white-washed brick walls provide the perfect backdrop for this unpretentious addition to the neighborhood
Manhattan restaurant insiders Laurent and Catherine Saillard have brought their expertise to Brooklyn in the form of farm-fresh ingredients and reasonable prices
Gastronomic highlights include the salad with arugula, spaetzle, cod, hanger steak, and for the finale, a chocolate pot de creme
There is also an excellent European wine list
I went to ICI last year and everything was great
Last night I really wanted to have a great meal, but unfortunately that wasn't the case
Our waitress was the main culprit
She had no knowledge of the wine list, no knowledge of the menu, and when recommending a wine, just sent out the most expensive that she could find
The appetizers were good, watermelon salad, and liver shnitzel, but the special fish? Perhaps the special old fish? It was salty, greasy, chewy, and overcooked, and best of all the salsa was the same basic ingredients as my watermelon salad (onions, olives, feta, peppers) minus the watermelon, thank god
We had to forage for our own silverware, clear our own plates, finally after 2 hours we'd had enough and were presented with our $100 bill, 3 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, 1 entree, 1 dessert, 1 tea
Not worth it
We keep going back to ICI for 2 years now
Last week again we had a great time
Beautiful mackerel with kim chee (properly served cold), tasty hanger steak and fantastic collard greens (still green not brown full of flavors and nutrients)
A real casual restaurant that is about food not hype!
Finally we were able to make it out to Ici and it was the absolute worst experience we have ever had
We had to get up and get our own salt and pepper from the bar as well as bringing our own plate to the kitchen for an undercooked steak
Not once did either waitress ( yes!! we had 2) come up to us and ask if everything was okay
Nor did they come over to refill our water glasses or ask me if Iwanted another glass of wine
The collard greens were undercooked and had no flavor but the overdose of chilli flakes
The steak had no flavor and the side dish of my makeral entree was cold
I could really rant on but I'm only allowed 150 words
There is nothing more upsetting than spending good money on bad service and bland food Don't believe the hype!!!
We went to ICi with my husband for the first time last week and had a great experience
We sat in their beautiful quiet garden and enjoyed every bite! We really liked the skate fish, the chicken liver schnitzel and their american chese selection
We will be back very soon
I thought the 'old fish' review was really hilarious
Honestly its great that the situation was handled with a delicate sense of humor
I can't wait to go there again ( had the steak last time ) and enjoy the beautiful cozy garden in the back
I just wont order the fish on a Sunday
Until last night, Ici was my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn
I ordered skate which had a strong ammonia odor
Not being familiar with skate, I had a few bites
Then I heard the women at the next table remarking that their skate smelled like ammonia

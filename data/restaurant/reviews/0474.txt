I love the the vaulted ceiling upstairs and the cozy lounge downstairs
The staff was nice and I had a great waitress
The service was timely and the food well above par
Plus the eye candy was amazing
A group of 5 hotties frollicked to my left and a stunner sat at the bar with midrift showing
I was in heaven
BUTTER was just great, despite all the negative reviews
I went there on Aug 9, 2002, from the start I was impressed
First, by the prompt seating ( even though we had no reservations), the very pleasant staff and not to mention the very cozy decor
Our waiter was helpful and friendly
Food and wine from appetizer to dessert was great too!  For such a styish restaurant the portions were right on the money
I loved everything and would recommend to everyone
I have basically tried all the places in the east village, and Butter is mediocre in comparison
The food is fairly good, but everything is spoiled by the OVERALL experience
I recommend Industry (food) instead
screwed up our reservation had to sit 3 ladies at a table for two when we reserved a table for 4
The owner lied to me when i asked where our food was 1 hour after we placed the order - he said oh your friend said you were not ready for it
Basically it was so bad that we got them back and we dined and DASHED - thanks for the free meal BUTTA
I will say the food was good but hey when its free it always tastes better right?! he hehehe
I should have listened to all of the poor reviews on this website
but I had faith
For a new restaurant in a bad economy they sure have a boatload of unecessary attitude
The maitre 'd is particularly full of himself
I have been to almost every top restaurant in the city and I have never been treated with such snotty service
Go spend your money somewhere else
The service is absolutely terrible
I waited 45 minutes just to get a bottle of a wine placed at the table
The wait staff is incredibly inattentive and rude
We were immediately seated (the restaurant was no where close to being packed, surprise, surprise) There are very few selections on the menu and the food is not that great and the dining experience at Butter is completely overrated
You're better off walking down half a block and going to Serafina or across the street to the Time Cafe
I give this restaurant one year, one and a half maximum, before it shuts down
I was looking forward to this dinner - the reviews were great, the venue looked amazing
But, alas, the service was TERRIBLE
The management the most ungracious in all of New York (and that takes some beating)
We were hassled from the beginning
The booking was made for 8
We were asked to sit down at 7
55
We were then asked again at 8
05, and again at 8
10
Our last party member arrived at 8
11 and we were told to sit or else we would loose our table - there were 3 other people in the restaurant! We were also told that we would have to leave at 10pm (this was not mentioned at the time of making the booking!)
We left at 10
15 with only a quarter of the restaurant full
NO SURPRISES THERE
And all this grief for a bill totalling more than $1,500!
It looks like Butter's architect designed a space that ultimately the owner's could not afford
The entrance is a bit unwelcoming, after you pass throught the glass doors you enter a cedar rich hallway and the woods at the entrance and downstairs are rich, but to my horror the main dining room is wallpapered in faux wood veneer making it look like a bad episode of trading spaces
The flowers also fake seemed to match only the bad wood wallpaper
Reservations were for 9:00pm,
we were sat at 10:30 then rushed through our dinner because the kitchen is closing menu is limited and overpriced $30
00 for chicken
The only saving grace were the desserts, which were excellent
The scene downstairs is exactly that a scene with a mixture of bridge and tunnel and east village meets holly go lightly
I give this place two years and that is being optomistic
Went there with some friends on Sat
night
Our waitress was so friendly and helpful it set the stage for a great evening
Great atmosphere and vibe
Food was delicious - definitely try the tuna
we had an 8
30 ressie for my friend's bday party in the lively room downstairs
we were bumped so jay-z could have the table intended for us and were not seated until 10
30 (2-hour wait!) in the quiet room upstairs
the stuck-up host had the audacity to tell us the wait was due to him trying to give us the best table they have (puh-leese!) we didn't get bread til nearly an hour after we were seated and that was after we asked for it
we did not finish dining until 1
30
if not for the fabulous hot sauce and super delice spicey dijon mustard AND, of course, our lovely waiter (he looked just like pee wee herman and was ADORABLE!), the night would have been a bust for sure
needless to say, i am no longer buying jay-z CDs nor will i be dining at butter
i'm still bitta
I've been to Butter one 2 seperate occasions and both times I was pleasantly surprised by the food and atmosphere
The staff was attentive
I was seated right away both times I've been
The food was superb
I particularly recommend the Black Bass w/ Fois gras and smoked ham
The food was ok
It's all downhill from there
If you choose to go, insist that your table is up the stairs in the room otherwise you will be forgotten
If you are given a table in the entryway, do not politely ask to be moved, be rude
The table to my left and right were accomodated after bitching, I was not
The service was terrible, waiter did not poor the wine correctly, my water glass was never refilled even after asking
There was a half-hearted attempt to accomomdate my requests but it seemed I was being a terrible dinner guest
Place is awful
I was very disappointed when I went to Butter this past weekend for dinner
The service was extremely snotty and there was tremendious attitude
We were not even given a wine list when we were seated
We had to ask for bread and BUTTER five times
we were finally given bread well after our entres had arrived
For the prices that they charge the service should be amicable
Although the food was tasty, it was not worth the aggrevation of this very unpleasurable dining experience
I had high hopes for Butter
First, we had to wait 45 minutes for our table
When we finally got it, the people who were seated closely next to us kept butting in on our conversation
The food was good, but the entree came so late that we devoured it as soon as it was placed in front of us
The clientele was only lukewarm
The girls at the table across from us were so drunk that when they got up to use the bathroom, they fell into our table! No one was dressed well
I was glad to get out of there and run to Pangaea
After a string of trendy new restaurant/lounges raised my hopes only to quickly deflate them (i

then
the wait
An hour and twenty minutes later our entrees came
Both our dishes were luke-warm and the seafood dish with the shrimp not fully cooked and the lamb 'special' waaaaaaay on the rare side
Apologies all around from the clueless staff and they even gave us a concilitory dessert
But alas, little giant, we shall not return
nor shall we recommend you on our short-list
Me and my girl just dropped in for a Monday night for a drink--it was awesome
Waiter was super helpful with making wine selection, even let us try a few to help us make a decision and then got into a great discussion about it
Had the milk and cookies for dessert, came out still steaming, baked to order
Even though it was late and the place had quieted down, we never felt rushed or ignored
Try it out on a Monday, you won't regret it
Went with a group of friends on Saturday night
and seemed to bring in the whole city behind us, place was jammed in seconds! Service stayed kind, food was awesome, hot waiters, great ambiance
though this didn't work for everyone
unfortunately, were sat next to a nasty, nasty group who could do nothing but complain about not having their drinks lickety split in a suddenly restaurant on a saturday night
We would've asked to have seats changed if the place weren't filled
Great casual dining spot to bring friends and have a great time on a Sat
night
If you want uptight, hushed experience, go somewhere else
Nasty careless service
Poor management and staff
Bad cocktails, overly salty food and slow, very very slow kitchen and even worse service attention to detail
Makes for a very bad restaurant to go with even the most little expectation
But yes, if you are kinky, and like to be treated badly, and eat bad food, this little Giant will certainly come through for you
Box of Rocks
WOW Swine of the Week
I did not even order
but thank god someone in my party did because I ate at least half of his
and that was after I finished my large portion of Duck Duck Goose
This is a must eat
some of the best food combinations I have ever had
Unforgetable on the Tummy
My fiace and I were pleasantly surprised by this fabulous restaurant! Great food(the scallops were delish!), great drinks and a wonderful ambiance
Go there if you are looking for a fantastic night with someone you love or a great group of friends
My boyfriend and I went here a little while ago and we were both blown away by it
The food and space are both amazing
You can tell this place is made with a lot of love
Everyone must check it out! Try the swine of the week or duck, duck, goose, and check out the creative cocktail list
Everyone can find something on this menu that they will love
We will be back there soon and I think this will very quickly become one of my favorite restaurants
This place is absolutely amazing
Everything is put together with such care and precision
The menu is invented and inspired
The food, itself, is across the board terrific
I haven't here several times now and will keep going back! The atmosphere is perfect
Don't miss this LES jewel!
Calling on foodies! This place is amazing
Check it out
I can see it becoming a quiet New York tradition
Definitely becoming the place to go on the LES
For my sister's birthday dinner, had one of the most disappointing dining experiences in New York
It started with a wait for a cocktail after our order - 30 minutes
Then waited for entree 2 1/2 hours
Kitchen only has 2 burners
And on top of that all the staff were being trained
Furthermore, no apologies up until we were served our entrees (but that was after we had asked over 4x when our entree would be served)
Order diet coke takes 20 minutes
At the end of our meal, we had expected some financial remuneration for the discomfort we experienced
However, there was nothing
To top it off, the owner came to us (after us waiting 15 minutes to speak to her) and raised her voice/lost it in front of her customers
In sum, they don't get that this is a hospitality business
the women that own this joint think their god's gift to the lower east side
beware
they'll ask you your opinion and if you make a comment they don't like, you will be made to feel like you never should have opened your mouth
do yourself a favor and just don't go
from the outside it looks interesting b/c of the orange paint and big windows, but inside, the bartender can't mix a drink for his life, the wine is way overpriced and the food is trying to be fancier than it should be
the menu is a mix of what the owners think is good
trust me, its not
its so not worth the money
I came here with 6 people on a friday
We got there early and got in without a reservation and the staff was very friendly
The food was absolutely amazing
Between the 6 of us we tried almost everything on the menu and we were all very pleased with our meals
I especially recommend the liver appetizer!
The scene was a bit Ramada Inn and the portions were cold! And small
We didn't get it
great food and good location but things started bad at the bar
the wine is mediocre at best and the cocktails are funky
not in a good way
not recommended for big groups
a party of six will all be served separately which is sort of unusual and uncomfortable
the duck duck goose is delicious! must try the toffee pudding - it's incredible
I've eaten at this restaurant twice
The first time was excellent, the second time good
The swine of the week was absolutely spiritual the first time, the second time, just good
The sausage appetizer is excellent, although they had better accompanying mustards the first time
The space is not elaborate, but you shouldn't expect this on the LES
If you want lush ambience, go somewhere else
If you like a hip envirionment with a cool vibe, not very large and tasty food, try it
The food is prepared with care
I was quizzed by the chef herself on both occasions for reactions to the food
My only complaint is that the service was uneven the second time
The wine list was ok, but small, and my waiter didn't seem to know much about it, recommending a Shiraz based on how much it sold, not having tasted it himself
I implore you all to try this place for yourselves and see just how good both the food and atmosphere are on a consistant basis
For some reason, there are a few negative reviews here that simply do not add up so don't listen to the (most likely) local competitors who are gnashing their teeth over LG's success - most importantly, I helped the owners put the place together, and they DID do it mostly themselves, and last time I checked, I wasn't Asian (not that there's anything wrong with that)
Secondly, for the negative reviewer who made a deal about how taxing their experience was for a Tuesday night? Look again at the restaurant's hours of operation - they are, and always have been closed on Tuesdays
Nice try quacks
Seriously, the food, atmosphere and owners of this place are amazing
Judge for yourself and you won't be sorry!

Our server's name was Andrew and he was the BEST server we have ever had in our days of dining out
He was knowledgeable about each menu item and was able to recommend the perfect wine for our meal
Andrew was incredibly attentive and is obviously a professional in the restaurant business
If you're in SOHO and are looking for a friendly, gorgeous restaurant with contemporary and cutting edge food, Zoe is the place for you
And if possible, ask for Andrew to be your server
He will make the experience everything that it could possibly be
The food is clever and delicious
The drinks are overpriced and brunch was way too crowded
For the prices, I felt they should space out the tables better to make it less like IHOP and more like a high-class restaurant in SoHo
The staff are very nice if not a little overworked on the weekends
I came back for brunch, great time, great food
the summer menu is fantastic
i recommend this place for a great menu
I've visited Zoe on 2 separate occasions and was blown away both times! The service is very attentive and nice
I've ordered the Salmon and the Sea Bass and they go down in my book as two of the best pieces of fish I have ever eaten! Extemely flavorful and perfectly seasoned yumminess
I can't wait to go back!
i am not sure how a dinner date would fare, but a fun, eclectic place for lunch
love the veggie restaurant week option, and the ny state wine selections
funky decor and waiter whose lines sounded like they came from the script he hoped he would someday be payed to read (same for the hostess, although they were both really nice)
gnocchi was ok, but a little mushy
if you are by yourself in soho, sit at the chef's bar in the back
You would never purposely go see a bad movie, or send a close friend on a boring blind date
So why subject your pallette to mediocrity that plagues us in everlasting quest for the ideal dining
Do yourself a much deserved favor and make plans to have a meal at Zoe!
I've been to brunch at Zoe 3 times and dinner during Restaurant Week once
The service has always been impeccable
True, the menu isn't exactly 6 pages long, but unless you're a really picky eater, there'll be something for you
My boyfriend and I haven't had issues with the portions or the quality of the food either
This restaurant excels at the little things
For example, I ordered an iced tea, which at other places would be served with a selection various sweetener packets
Here, they give you a small cup with simple syrup so you don't have to wait for any sugar to dissolve
Zoe is a great deal for its location and quality, and that's why we keep going back
Everything was good, the service, the food, the value
they were out of some items, but no major deal
The Ambiance was ok, not the greatest
I have been to a lot of great rests in the city, and this one I guess it measured up, although the servings were kind of small for us guys
Al in all a good place
Would I go back???? With so many rest around, I think I would try someplace else the next time, but if you haven't been ever, then it is worth it
Went to Zoe's over the weekend and although we made reservations, don't think they were needed
The thing I didn't like about this place is that their wine menu was bigger than the food menu
Go figure
I had a really hard time trying to pick something to eat
Usually that's because there are so many things on the menu that sound good
This was not the case here
Calamari was delicious, with the sauce
But everything else was so so
The service was good, but I recommend this place for people who like out to drink wine more then to eat
Although they lost my reservation, the error was quickly rectified and we were seated promptly, even though it was Restaurant Week
The hostess was gracious and apologetic
The service was very good
Our waitress new exactly what she was doing and what to recommend
Prompt service, but we were not rushed
It's very crowded and a bit cramped, but has a good vibe and the food was very tasty
I would definitly go back
Wonderful experience
Food was incredible, ambience was better than average, lovely decor, excellent service, attractive plating, creative menu
No complaints whatsoever, a wonderful place to visit for a quick dinner or a lengthy social gathering for a party of friends
Highly recommended
Traveling for the first time to NYC, I was able to experience Zoe's
The food was exactly what I was looking for in terms of great restaurants
Not only was the food excellent it was served in very reasonable portions
The waiter was very knowledgeable about the food but especially the wine
We picked one out and he described it perfectly, which I have often found rare
The food looked right out of a magazine and tasted fantastic
They take their time to make the perfect dish
I will visit again on my next trip!
The first time I went to Zoe was during restaurant week this winter, and I keep going back because it's a guaranteed excellent experience
The wine list is chock full of really good deals, whether I feel like splurging or not, and recently I've gotten the same waitress who really knows what she's talking about regarding the food
The music and paint job could use a little update, but once you've had a couple of their Hemingway daquiris, you stop caring
Love the atmosphere- great steaks-service was a little slow- but they make up for it with really good food at a great price
My friend and I went to Zoe for lunch during restaurant week
The restaurant is a half a block from the train right in SoHo which made it very convenient for a mid-week lunch
We got a three course lunch for $20
but if you don't get a pre-fixe menu, this place is definitely pricey
BUT
the food was absolutely delicious but the portions were on the small side
The white bean soup was interesting and my tortellini was divine
The blood orange cupcake I had for dessert topped off the experience just right!! The plates were enough for my friend and I but had I brought my boyfriend or a slightly larger friend, they would have left hungry
Food, ambience and service were very nice
I specially liked house smoked halibut and salomon
They were very refreshing
I also had the wood-burning grilled veal tenderloin
It was excellent
Normally I just pop by after work, an app or a few cocktails
But recently I gave it a go with a full on dinner for my wife and our friends
Honestly, I drank enough I can't recall the sides, but the courses were big, good, fair in price
The nicest thing was the fact that our waitress recognized me as a bar patron and gave our table very personal and attentive service
Food's good, like most places around there, but I really felt like I was appreciated and we all noticed her attitude
Basically thanks for a great night that I was taking a risk on, music though, more variety
My wife and I went to Zoe last night for the twelve days of Xmass menu
$45 for three courses AND you get a Soho Partnership Shopping card along with a bag of goodies
The portions were generous and the food was great
We sat at the food counter and met the Chef- Nathan, who was really nice and sent us an extra dessert
Service was friendly and the wine list is KILLER
I will be back soon
If you wanna DRINK wine, then Zoe is by far the place to be
Their all American wine list is simply the best of the best in American wines
I found a bottle of Pinot Noir for like $48, which I saw in another restaurant for over $60
The value was unbelievable
The food, too, was way above average

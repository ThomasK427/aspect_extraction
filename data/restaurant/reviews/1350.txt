I'll take the meat packing runway look over heroin chic taco stand anyday!
This place is fantastic for parties or dinners with friends
The food is outstanding, the service attentive and the layout unique
My friends and I all loved it - and I'm not a big Mexican food person
The beef tacos stole the show
There are candles and tequilla bottles everywhere making a great backdrop for photos
Make reservations very early in advance
They have several tables set up for large parties and they all get booked
The food is tasty; servers are generally attentive; the decor is great
but one owner is inappropriate
After he pushed past me twice, my request for an excuse me was retorted, I own this place
Since when was la Esquina a nightclub?   I am in the school of thought that a restauranteur should be courteous to all of his customers, first most idealistically because he wants them to return but also because he never knows who he might be speaking with
I think that this owner should abandon his promoter-like attitude and adopt that of perhaps a lost ideology the customer is always right (or maybe just don't shove your customers) because when the next New York hot spot is calling their crowd, who's going to be there to support them?
I was skeptical at first- The whole hidden basement, secret password schtick seemed like nothing but a clever gimic to make up for a restaurant lacking any true quality
Boy, was I right
From the rude and wildly incompetent staff to the sub-par food, to all the bs you have to put up with just to get a table (a skanky taqueria for a waiting room?)- clueless trendoids can keep La Esquina
Seriously not worth it
Sure the huitlacoche quesadillas melt in your mouth, and the sugary sangria glides deliciously down your throat, but you can only enjoy these decadent treats if you have time to swallow them quickly enough before the army of bus boys and/or angry waitresses swoop in to rapidly clear every item off of your candle-lit table just as soon as they see just a slight dip in consumption activity!! So forget it if you want savor your last bite over a dwindling glass of wine- for your serene second of dining bliss will certainly be halted as your glassware, silverware, and every last crumb is literally ripped out from underneath you
This restaurant holds up to its amazing ambience and star-power; however its rushed service really leaves a bad taste in your mouth
I have enjoyed drinks at La Esquina in the past and was looking forward to taking my boyfriend there for dinner
Making a reservation proved to be a challenge, as no one would return my messages when I left them requesting a table
I finally lucked out and got a live person on the phone to secure my table
On the big night, I called to say we were running 5 minutes and was told it would be fine
Once there, the self-important and bizarre looking french doorman told us that we did not have a reservation
He dismissed us with a look down his nose and turned his back on us, end of discussion
I have NEVER been treated so rudely at a restaurant in NY and have no intention of returning to such a pretentious taco stand, I don't care how secret it is
cool underground restaurant
decor is rustic edgy at the same time
Loud but romantic
Tequilla list was overwhelming
Wine margaritas are nice
NEED Reservations in order to get past the host by the secret door and the maitre d host downstairs but No trace of snooby attitude here
food was satisfying
Very cool spot, great ambience and scene
Terrific tequila list (although far from value priced)
Ceviche starter and chicken tostadas were great
Carne Asada was good, but definitely had better elsewhere
I'd definitely go back
Hidden, romantic
but the stupidest hostess you'll ever meet
total moron, really detracted from the ambiance
too bad
If you dig good Mexican food - and we're not talking street meat or tex-mex - than this little find is one to store in the memory banks
I have eaten here twice and both times were excellent! I make a point to dine there everytime I'm in NYC! It's really a must do for everyone
except kids
It's very romantic in a cool-edgy way and a great place to take someone whom you may want to impress the hell out of
I love you LA ESQUINA!
I love this place
It is great
The food was fantastic
get the corn on the cobb!!!!! Chicken was very tasty
I will go back again
Went Sat for dinner
Great entrance, super ambiance, good small plate food and excellent drinks and service
Not crowded at all and you definitely feel like you're someplace special
The DJ was really good to boot! Highly recommended
it just starts out cool, they walk you down what seems to be a hidden staircase, thru the kitchen and then into the downstairs dining area
the ambience is probably the best thing about this place
downstairs is a slew of hidden, candle-lit dining spaces and very cool bar
the food was a bit above average, nothing incredibly special
but the service and the ambience more than make up for it
it's a hard reservation to get so book early
the mini tacos were excellent and drinks a highlight, well worth a visit
If they took the food up a notch or two this could be one of the best certainly most unique Mexican restaurants in the city
I was here a few weeks ago and ate at their cafe around the corner on lafayette
Portions are very small and taste good but not worth $13 or $15 to leave hungry
The chocolate cake was realllllllly good though
La Esquina is the best new restaurant I have been to this year
It's really difficult to find much wrong with this Nolita newcomer
It's VERY romantic, relaxing and the food is totally tasty! Reservations are difficult but well worth it
Aside from a little attitude from the skinny model wannabe at the top of the stairs, everything was 100% perfect for me and my date
Get your reservations fast, this place is gonna get over run very soon
This is the perfect place to take a special someone for a tete a tete or to go chill with some friends
Was a little skeptical of the food and location, but they proved me wrong
Make reservations fast before the secret is out!!
Great little Taco Bar
Featured in Time Out New York so I gave it a try
Soooo good
Only a short time and it will be found out and overcrowded
Numero 28 went out of their way to arrange a perfect pizza birthday party! They generously accomodated our group of 11 in their intimate space and provided a fabulous tirimisu cake! The pizza was delicious, the service was excellent and we even got treated to special after-dinner drinks (apparently good for digestion) on the house! We will certainly go back to this special place in the future!
Went here on a recommendation from a friend who found this while walking through the Village
The ambiance was very casual and relaxed
The service was very attentive
Most of all the pizza was absolutely awesome! This is not one of your run of the mill by the slice places
This pizza is the real deal
All the ingredients were fresh and it tasted very authentic
Reminded me of when my wife I were in Italy
I live couple blocks away and I am at No
28 at least once a week
This place has the best pizza in NY, highly recommend it! They have outdoor seating, it's a great place to sociolize with friends and enjoy great food
A couple of friends of mine stopped by this place last night and we had an incredible time
The food was magnificent! They had all sorts of good quality toppings
Our favorite was the San Danielle and the Pear with Gorgonzola
I read the review below and I would definitely say to disregard it, we had great service
They were very attentive with us and not to mention everyone else there it was fantastic because they all spoke Italian and that made everything even better
It was like being in Italy!!! I would definitely give them two thumbs up and recommend it to all
As the table beside ours was on their way out they muttered about the horrible service, we should have heeded their warning
We had a party of six, sat ourselves out on the sidewalk after waiting, waited for menus, waited another 10 minutes to order, then-after 15 minutes- our dishes proceeded to come out once every 10 minutes
One of my friends would finish and then another would receive their plate
The waitress was borderline deaf or completely ignoring everyone around her

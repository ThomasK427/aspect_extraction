Jerry the General Manager and owner makes every customer feel right at home! I love this place
this is by far the best italian food in the city
the prices are reasonable, the portions are huge and the service could not get better, be sure to try the tiramisu for dessert and if they are serving gnochi then you HAVE to get it since no gnochi is comparable
i ahve been going there for at least ten years now and it only gets better
can get a bit crowded so call for reservations unless you come early
The pizza here is so good that our family comes here once every couple of weeks
And for only $6 per pie which can feed up to 2, its affordable
This place is known for the steaming hot cheese they use
Not the traditional large pie / slice pizza
Each mini-pie feeds up to 2
Good People, Good Food, Good Atmosphere
Parking is terrible around here so its best to come here after 7pm when the streets are clear
We go to eat pizza just to this place
Tony knows my daugther since she was born (1991) an is the only pizza she and her friends like
Nice place
A great family place where 2 can eat out of one plate
(They serve a lot of food) The taste??? too die for
Excellent Service
where can you eat in nyc for under $15 and get so much food in a nice and clean and very attentive restaurant
ask for the bandeja tipica you won't be disappointed
Their counter service is less than desirable, it's cold and no one knows how old it is
Their delivery of fresh hot pizza
wow, it's addictive
Amazing crust (and I hate pizza crust typically), great cheese, sauce isn't too sugary
it was perfect
I used to always make fun of NY Pizza like Rays and such, but this pizza is great!
Pizza Boy is an establishment of long standing in Jackson Heights
Although tiny (take-out recommended) the quality of its food is in the best tradition of the traditional New York Neighborhood pizzaria
Lemongrass Beef is a must
It takes a bit fatty, however its a very rewarding plate
Very affordable place as well
Highly recommended
Unlike the previous reviewer, I had no problems at all with service, everyone was super nice
I would definitely return
I was with a friend and we were having dinner
One of the waiters rudely told us that other people were waiting for seats
He wasn't even our table waiter
Hence it to say that we stuck to our guns and stayed a little longer to have dessert
Due to the rude comment of that particular waiter, we didn't leave a tip
We paid our bill at the cashiers and the change was only a penny which we told the cashier he could have
Nonetheless the waiters were very rude when we left and used the f-word and laid the finger on us
I cannot recommend this place which gave us such lousy treatment and the waiters were so rude
This looks like a fancy Chinese restaurant you would find on Canal Street in Chinatown but this is in the Elmhurst, Queens: mostly fast food chinese restaurants
Their menus look like magazines with their entrees on pictures
Their service is good and friendly
They have plenty of waiters and busboys walking around to help you
Seafood is very good as well as the pecking duck
Very good place to bring your family
This is one of two Ping's in Queens, the other one on Queens Blvd in Elmhurst serves great seafood dishes fished straight off clean tanks
Best presentation for a Chinese resataurant
Take your American friends there
Of course they serve most dishes with the heads on
Dim Sum is really good here
it is fresh
they offer a variety of them
I believe this is the oldest Argentinian restaurant in NYC
Anyway, I've been to this place several times and have never been disappointed
Their steaks are second to none (given that they don't use an asador) and they have a nice list of affordable Argentinian malbecs and cabs
Glad it's tucked away in a dark corner in Elmhurst and only a few know about the place
Steaks are 100% great
Sangria's are always good
People there are very friendly
It's been a long while since I have had a nice piece of steak that i was really overly-satisfied with
La Fusta did it for me and my boyfriend
The service wasn't that great
The waiter never really came by to check on us and I had to get up and ask for another beer
But the food is to die for
My father is in show business and we have traveled around the world
NO WHERE, and I mean NO WHERE have I eaten so well, and treated so well as this restaurant
Its a Family restaurant with El Tata and Gaspar - father and son - who make eating a delight
Recommend Bife Chorizo with the avocado salad
Banana crepes for dessert
I am currently in Ecuador and cant wait to get back to NY
First stop, home
Drop the luggage and go eat at La Fusta
This place is in my neighborhood, my partner and I eat there all the time! I haven't had much Argentinian cuisine, but the food there is really good
The staff is wonderfully friendly, and the steak is perfect! Try the shell steak, the cream of shrimp soup, and the banana crepe, they are the best
I passed by this little Thai restaurant several times and finally I decided to give it a try
I ordered curry chicken and green papaya salad
The soup (sauce) of the curry chicken is too salty
The papaya salad is too garlicy
I eat Thai food all the time, and I believe I know what good Thai food is
I don't know if it's just because the chef wasn't in a good mood that day
My husband and I discovered My Thai tucked away in Elmhurst a few months ago and are regulars and huge fans now
The food is delicious, the staff courteous and the ambience perfect for families or hanging out with friends
Be sure to try the Tom Yum soup
It's the best I've ever had
This restaurant is Cash Only
Aside from the wide selection of delightful foods, adjustable to your taste, mild, hot, or burn! My Thai is also a very cozy comfy place for a casual get together
They are also able to accommodate large groups
It's a family owned, family run restaurant with a young staff who will make you feel welcomed
Their BBQ is excellent and their waitstaff is very friendly and quick
At times I heard waitresses taking orders in Korean, Chinese, English, and Spanish
The food and service is quick, and often the taste is spot on
They offer a sushi bar with very fresh fish, and the side dishes are excellent
Even though it's a trek for me to get there and the place is a little of a Hole in the wall, I've gone many times for the food alone
It's the only place where a chilean salad is a real Chilean Salad, and they know what you mean when you order a Bisteque a lo Pobre
Authentic, yummy, delicious! Just like my mami's cooking
They have some good noodle soup
Pretty cheap for bowls abour $4-5

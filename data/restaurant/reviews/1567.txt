Go forth and eat
This is the Bomb
Good food and service! Great after a busy nite out
The food is terrific- great variety, great flavors! The service is great, just my all around favorite place!
Good spacious eatery,lots of variety at this 24 hour resteraunt, not another boring cafe
Fun place with great food at a good price
Casual atmoshphere, not a date place
But great for after clubbing or a night out drinking
Open 24 hours
Thank goodness somewhere's still open all night, and that it's Veselka
Lots of Eastern European favorites with a downtown twist, plus some slightly yuppified offerings, a small but not unpleasantly crowded space and an inexplicably high-energy vibe make Veselka an East Village classic
The Scene Owner Andrew Silverman (City Crab, Steak Frites) has developed a reputation for theme- and decor-driven restaurants that manage to exceed expectations for food and service
An avid collector of Americana, Silverman designed the Chat 'n' Chew space in a way that recalls a slightly bumpkinish country diner
The Food The menu continues the down-home theme, with solid versions of cream of sweet potato soup, chicken pot pie and macaroni and cheese
Those who crave a year-round tryptophan fix will find much to love in the Thanksgiving on a Roll--a turkey sandwich loaded with stuffing and cranberry sauce
To drink, splurge on a $5 milkshake, or opt for the bottomless cups of soda avidly and infinitely refilled by cheery waitresses
Okay, so I had the urge for good ol' fashion homemade mac n cheese
And so decided to try this place
I went solo and it was a Friday night
As I made my way to the entrance and saw the Chat 'n' Chew sign, I knew that this would be a cheesy place
As I walked in, a waitress there came up to me and greeted me with a warm smile
I ordered a sassy sour and mac n cheese
It took a pretty long time for her to bring the drink back, which was a bit too strong to my preference
The mac n cheese, however, certainly did it for
It was definately the best mac n cheese I've ever tasted
And the outside was nice and crispy
Overall, I would definately recommend this place for large groups since the atmosphere is more of a family/festive gathering
I have been to Chat 'n' Chew on two different occasions
Both times were somewhat disappointing
The good things about this place--the menu items are familiar, and the food is fresh
For example, the green bean casserole isn't the kind your aunt makes at Thanksgiving, it's fresh green beans with real onions, etc
However, the portions are small for the prices, and the food is average
The best place to get home cooking at GREAT prices is in the Alphabet City, Mama's, where you can get the most amazing home made food for 10 bucks
(Mama's is on 3rd street between Ave
A and Ave
B)
Other than that Chat 'n' Chew's decor is a little cheesy, as if Disneyworld made a Midwest-themed restaurant
There are so many great restaurants in the Union Square area, don't waste your time or your money
i came here yesterday night for dinner with 3 other people
my friend took a look at the menu and exclaimed, this is real food! and it is lots and lots of good old american comfort food served by very accommodating waitresses
i ordered the grilled catfish po boy (~$10) and substituted their normal massive mound of skin-on fries with an equal pile of sweet potato fries
both varieties of the shoestring fries were tasty
the catfish was simply seasoned and flaky
i also tried their grilled cheese sandwich (made with 3 kinds of cheese) with tomato bacon (~$8)
they didnt skimp on the thick-cut bacon and the bread was grilled crispy and buttery
another friend ordered the coca-cola cake (~$5), a surprisingly airy but very sweet chocolate cake made from coke syrup
bill came to about $55 for the 4 of us, which i thought was reasonable
I brought my friend with me a couple of weeks ago and it was as good as I remembered from a decade ago
The ceiling is a little low and feels like someone's basement rec-room
The service was very attentive, perhaps a little too much so, and the catfish po'boy was tasty
My friend had the BLT and was shocked by the volume of bacon it contained- she had to remove some of it in order to eat the sandwich
We also ordered the onion strings, which were huge and had to have been cut from several onions
We had a lovely experience and would definitely go there again!
try it, it's not fancy, so don't expect it to be, it's just good down home cooking, a little taste of southern, but not too much, a little on the expensive side for what you get, but everything in that area is
This place was such a disappointment
I went here with 4 of my closest girlfriends and the food was HORRIBLE
American cuisine?? Try greasy cuisine!! They had nothing on the menu that we ordered because the kitchen was having a rough night
The service was slow, the waitress spilled drinks and food on my friends more than once, and the fish was cold
You are better off staying home! I do not recommend this place
Even though it's cheap, it's still a waste of money
Ths place is so satisfying for cheap comfort food that'll make you leave happy
A delight
Great salads and mac and cheese like no other
I have a foggy memory of coming here about 10 years ago and liking it
Well I tried it again last night and it was a huge disapointment
First off the place is messy, with crumbs and spills everywhere
We sat near the sluggish, hot and very loud kitchen and the service area was not wiped down once during the entire time
The servers were friendly enough, but were also very unkempt looking
My chicken caesar had a watery dressing with very little flavor, soggy and burned croutons and wilted lettuce
The medium rare steak on the Wedge Salad was very tough and and closer to well done
The cocktails were all mixer
I don't know why we came here in the first place, but we are not coming back
Will never go again
After being seated at a table right next to the cutlery station where our ears were blasted by the shrill sounds of metal clashing against metal, we changed tables on our own
This place is the kind of diner where management encourages serve-staff to be as rude and as flip as they want to customers because they think that adds to its 'cool' factor
The portions are huge, yes, but the fried chicken we had was edible purely because the sauce was alright
We left the mashed potatos and cooked vegetables untouched
the service is forgetful but apologetic (which gets old fast)
but it's still worth it
Mainly for out of town visiters who aren't into that foodie food the rest of us love to exploe
this place offers a relaxed feel with lots of american food done well
The portions are big, but good also because they aren't cheap with the good ingredients--bacon, fries etc
I've dined here for years and enjoyed delicious comfort food - burgers, awesome sweet potato or skin-on fries, desserts, etc
But last time we went, we had awful service at the bar from a fair weather bartender (all good - she was there friendly, as our delay stretched on - she avoided eye contact with us like the plague)
The computer system at the bar wasn't correctly sending orders to the kitchen so our food took over an hour to get to us
Saw the same computer-malfunction-delay happen to more than one takeout customer while waiting
The manager was defensive and cold (though he did agree to discount our food)
Do yourself a favor and wait for a table when you go here at a peak mealtime
Or
go elsewhere
I was tickled that such a comfy cozy place was nestled near hustle bustle union square area
A nice break from the many uptight places
I thoroughly enjoyed my banana and pecan pancakes
Though the waitress had an overly cutsie personality, her service was commendable
Another revue comented on the attractiveness of the waitresses
Its unessecary to coment on the attractivness of the employees, especially when the appeal of this place is comfort, not high fashion
If you have an open mind you will enjoy this restaraunt for what it is
Chat 'n' Chew has some of the best french fries in the world
Space gets kind of crowded in there--because it's so popular--but it's worth the wait because the food is very good
The service is also great, our waitress was very prompt and had an excellent knowledge of the menu

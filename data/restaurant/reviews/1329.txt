ONE HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES later, we were finally seated, but inside
No biggie, we were still in a good mood
The bartender had offered us ONE beer on the house for our troubles
OK
The waitress was great (Saacha), the food was amazing and it arrived quickly
By this time it was 10:30pm and we were starving
At the end of the meal, I politely asked the waitress whether she would comp something, and she said yes
The next thing we know, the bartender comes over and says (and I quote verbatim), I already gave you two beers (which he hadn't)
No one held a gun to your head to stay here
Just pay the bill
I was so insulted, not to mention embarrassed in front of my friends, that I didn't know how to react
I told him we would pay and leave promptly - which we did
We also left a nice tip
To the manager of Brooklyn Fish Camp: We live and work in Park Slope and are avid restaurant-goers in the area
You just lost not only our business, but that of our friends - which is not negligible (and they tell two friends, and so on
)
We spent $350 at your establishment that night
A simple gesture of kindness would have sufficed to keep our future business
My husband and I were in the mood for seafood and decided to try the lobster at Brooklyn Fish Camp
There was a great crowd on Saturday night, great ambiance, and we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table
The service was impeccible, the food was even better
We initially ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress though we may not like it, so she offered us a taste
She was right and wound up choosing a wonderful bottle of wine that she selected
If you like french fries - try theirs, out of this world
I'd go back in a New York minute!
Cute place in a cute town
You can find some great deals in Park Slope for dinner for four
BFC is not one of them
Here are the good things: good ambience, well lit for a romantic dinner, not pretentious, food is pretty good, service is warm and prompt
The not so goods: very pricey appetizers - $12 for a half cup of fried clams, $6 for two corn on the cob and $6 for a small plate of fries
Cokes are 10 oz and expensive
Entrees are a bit pricey too for average sized portions
But the food itself is pretty good
Just not worth the price
Our party had a good time, but we felt like to go to Gray's Papaya afterwards to balance the evening
If you're pocket is padded, then it's a no brainer, but if you're not ready to drop $200 for four, don't go
It was such a beautiful day, my girlfriend and I wanted to sit and eat outside
the hostess took our name and let us know that she'd call us on our cell phone when our table would be ready (we had a 40 minute wait)
my steamers were great, but my girlfriend's mussels were over-cooked
I ordered a lobster, which was cooked to perfection, my girlfriend had the lobster roll (highly over-rated and disappointing)
we barely saw our server during our meal (and it wasn't that busy by the time we sat down)
but I definately saw some other dishes I want to come back and try
Brooklyn Fish Camp is such a wonderful dining experience
The staff is friendly and inviting
It is much less crowded than Mary's in the village, so its less hurried
You can't go wrong
BFC feels like a New England coast seafood restaurant, only it's better
Having lived downeast, I know how difficult it is to find a decent seafood spot up there
At BFC and MFC in the City, you get a daily choice of all types of shellfish, whole prepared fish, raw treats, lobster rolls, soups, salads and desserts
I tried some BC oysters that were expertly shucked and very fresh, and inexpensive (6-4-10
) I also had lovely pan seared soft-shell crab on a bed of arugula, yellow tomatoes, jalapenos and unfortunately unripe avocados
I am a big fan of gazpacho, but I found the one here a tad rough around the edges, maybe even a little thoughtless
I'd stick with the seafood
There's no bar, only beer and wine, and you're likely to be annoyed by unruly Park Slope offsprings, so come late and enjoy the smart wine list
cheeseburger pizza was yummy
music was good
but they ONLY sell bottled evian? And the Evian didn't even taste like Evian
I swear they just refill the bottle wityh tap water
We recently went to pizza bar for my birthday gathering
Though my friends liked the food, we were all in agreement that the snotty waitress and host put a damper on our celebration
I think the pizza bar would be better served if the management reminded their staff that the customers are the reason they are there and not the other way around
Major dissappoinment!!
It looks great, the music is great, really good food (the pizza's!!), great drinks, no waiting
no cover
it's a very chill spot to hang with a group, I went there with a bunch of my friends to have drinks for my birthday and we all had a great time
It wasn't too packed, we saw a couple of rockstars and actors hanging out, It's a very nice spot to just drink, talk and listen to some cool rap and rock songs from back in the day and there's no cover or dress code
Snobbish Waitstaff, grossly overpriced tasteless pizza, drinks had little alchohol in them, greasy, soggy calamari (ugh), so loud in there you can't hear person across from you, uncomfy seats resemble the whirly wind ride at your neighborhood carnival, if person behind so much as breathes heavy the seats lunge into your back and pretentious atmoshere (but why?) make this new MPD Pizza place a definite NO-NO
It's trying to be a hipster place but isn't making it
Suggested to go to Rays Pizza and then hit PM Nightclub and you'll spend less and have more fun
The pizza is good and the pesto fries are fantastic! This is a good spot to go with a large group who is looking for late night food in an informal setting
We got a table in the back with about 12 people and ordered drinks, appetizers, and pizza (plenty of food for everyone) and it was about $20 per person
I went to pizza bar last weekend with a group of friends
We were blown away by this place
The atmosphere blew us away almost as much as the music
The waitresses were all gorgeous and frienly
The food was perfect for the late night situation
Drinks were flowing and the crowd was young and hot
Go there with a group or just a couple of friends and you're guaranteed to have a blast
Really becoming (with sister restaurant BLT), one of my favorite restaurants
Very similar to BLT (minor differences only to menu)
Served with pre-appetiser warm pate and then gruyere popovers before you get into the food
Steaks wonderful and perfectly cooked with a range of tasty and imaginative sauces, but other dishes (especially braised short ribs, dover sole) are perfect
Large quantities - but save room for the vegetables, which are the real highlights I think, for example perfect mash potato, leek hash browns, creamed spinach and always a range of mushrooms - suggest you share a few
A range of specials each night of all courses and vegetables
Have never made it to desserts but they look great, and you get free nibbles at te end of the meal as well anyway
Great atmosphere and perfect staff - even telling me I had ordered too much
Wine list long and varied, but pricey
Real downside is that it is difficult to book
This had to be one of the more dissapointing restaurants that we have been to in a long time
At our table we had 3 different cuts of steak but they all tasted mediocre
The sides were good but lets face it, that's not what we went there for
The atmosphere has a lot of potential but the too loud 80's music, paper menu's and a 25 foot plastic full wall menu were turn offs
Service was so, so
Our waiter had attitude
The only thing that matched up to the rating on this place was the price
We will not be returning
i had a greatest moment at this restaurant with my girls
Not only was the food amazing, but the sommelier had the cutest little tight suit on
I couldn't help but glancing at the kitchen, because all of the chefs were so amazingly gorgeous!!! :) the guy with the mohawk
not only made my mouth water, but made my seat wet (because the waiter spilled some water :) )

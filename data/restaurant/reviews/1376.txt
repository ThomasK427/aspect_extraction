The portions were paltry and overpriced for what they actually were
Everything was overspiced in exactly the same manner, and I know Malaysian food
Ambience? seriously amateur Asianized decor
A so so decoratior with a tiny budget a half hour spent at Pearl River could do better
You can tell this place really cuts a lot corners with food, service/staff and tries to promote itself as something it's not
Eat in Chinatown instead
Never had Malaysian, but the flavors and textures were WONDERFUL
Hot, spicy, sweet, everything was a new experience
The place encourages family style meaning, everyone had what they wanted with the intent to share, not discriminating on how much was ordered, but what was ordered, we kept ordering until we couldn't eat anymore
The pickled watermelon salad and fatty duck were SINFUL
Beer seleciton varied well priced
Walk in wanting to try something new, you'll not be dissapointed, great service is hard to find, great food even harder, Fatty Crab is meant for the food
We arrived at Fatty Crab at 7:10 requested a table for 4
We were told the wait would be 30 - 40 minutes
8PM we asked for an update
We were told a table was being cleaned for us
Ten minutes later we still weren't seated and the host was speaking with a newly arrived guest
They were standing in front of us discussing and her affiliation within the food industry
Moments later she was seated at what we thought was our table
Now, we had been waiting over an hour
When I questioned the host, I was told that the table was always hers
I asked why we were told the table would be ours
He had no response and said we would be seated shortly in a very nonchalant manner
We mentioned we were leaving due to poor service, we received a response of I don't care
The food here is definitely for those that enjoy spice and the unexpected
It is not toned down for those with timid palettes, nor does it pander to the brunch set
If you want delicious food, friendly, casual service, and a great wine selection this is the place to go
I highly reccomend the ribs for a full meal or the tea sanwiches for a snack!
The restaurant itself is cozy, bustling, unpretentious
Love it!
The waiter told us that the dishes were family style, so when we got the Fatty Duck dish, we started laughing at the 6 bite-size morsels staring up at us from the plate
By the time the Grouper came, we thought each dish would just continue to shrink, as it was nothing but a slice (2
5x3) of fish camouflaged in a puddle of coconut sauce presented in a single-serving soup bowl
And that was the most expensive thing we ordered
While the prices were reasonable, the portions were not
Even my glass of wine was actually half a glass of wine
I won't be back
Is the food good? YES! Is it authentic? SOMEWHAT! Is the ambience hip? DEFINITELY! Is it inexpensive? NO
The prices are not high (mostly around $10/dish) but the serving size is minuscule
We ordered Kang Kong Belachan ($7) and the Black Bass Masak Lemak ($15)
Both came in small rice bowls that were filed half way to the rims
They looked like leftovers from someone else's meal than a full entree
The Short Ribs Rendang ($17) had two pieces of short ribs, much of it being bones
Our three entrees plus an appetitzer of Oyster Omelette and four glasses of wine came up to $120
It a great restaurant if you have NEVER had Malaysian food and don't mind spending $40/person for a regular dinner
Otherwise, head out to Chinatown and get the same, if not better food for a quarter of the price
Yes, that's right, the signature dish is actually only half of a crab, with no crab fat included-those who know crab know what I'm talking about
I know it's only $28, but there was no indication on the menu that we would not get a full chili crab as we had expected
Furthermore, being half Singaporean, I have to say that the little crab we got really could not compare to the many scrumptuous chili crabs I have consumed in my short life; it tasted more like the sweet and sour pork version of crab
The hostess informed us at 7:15 on a Tuesday night that it would be about 15-20 minutes wait
We were seated at 8:30
So famished that even the scorched octopus salad seemed delicious, we couldn't say we were satisfied
Especially with the non-fatty, non-chili half of a crab
The food, though good for the most part (very good duck and chicken with rice dish, but awful charred squid salad - tasted bitter going down), was the least memorable part of the meal
Not likely to go back because of the absurd physical set-up of the place
We were seated against the wall, my friend in the booth part and me in the chair
When my friend wanted to get up to use the restroom, we had to call a member of the staff over because in order to get out, one must move the chair and the table away from the wall so that the person in the booth can get out
It was completely disruptive and any time anyone else around us got up or sat down, there was similar irritation
I don't think they have delivery yet, so skip it until then
This place is amazing!!!!! We went there this week and got seated immediately
The decor is simple, unpretentious but interesting and detail-oriented
I love the colorful chopsticks on the table in a special container (seemingly a recycled peanut oil tin), and the real china plates, bowls, with traditional and artful designs, the stamp at the bottom indicats the identity of authentic china, which is rare even in Chinatown restaurants
Food was delicious and creative: definitely try the quail egg shooters, the slow cooked pork ribs, and basically everything  BTW, the chicken wings were 6 pieces, the price was very reasonable
We fed ourselves happily with 1 appetizer, 3 entrees, 1 vegetable, 2 rices, and the bill was within $50 bucks! Last but not least, the servers are very attentive but not aggressive at all
I'll definitely go back there again and again and again
After reading good reviews, we went to try Fatty crab
Place was crowded, we had to cramp into a table for 6, but fine, as many other NY restaurants, maybe it is to give us an Asian local experience'
Food, however, was totally disappointing
This restaurant is called Fatty crab, but the crab was anything BUT fatty
The 2 crabs we ordered had almost no meat
I have eaten crabs in many (asian or not) cities and countries, and also our local Chinatown, but this is by far the 'lean'est crab I have ever eaten
Sure, the sauce was good and spicy, but for $29, I expect a full-serving of crab
If you really want to eat crab the Asian way, just go to Chinatown
The rest of the food was just ok
Portion was small, and very overpriced
3 chicken wings for $9?  I definitely will not go back
Sadly, the inexperience of the waitstaff will keep me from coming back
Food was fantastic, but wasn't good enough to compensate for: 1) waiting for 15 minutes at our table before the crew figured out which waiter was assigned to us (no one seemed to know) 2) entree arriving before starters 3) entree arriving without a serving spoon (spoon came 5 minutes later) 4) waiter asking twice if we had more food coming (answer was yes, but he should have known that) and 5) plates being taken off the table before we had finished eating
The service was so bad it was ridiculous
We repeatedly saw the waitstaff standing around by the kitchen, looking utterly clueless
We were almost laughing by the end of our experience--we couldn't believe how inept they were
Shame, too, since the food was quite lovely
read a raved review about this restaurant, but the experience was disappointing
they don't take reservation
waited for over an hour for a table (4 of us), when promised the wait would be 30 mins
the manager didn't know how to optimize seating and had a bad attitude when we inquired politely about tables
it was average asian food and the portion was small given the price
it was just better packaging and marketing, along with the novelty of malaysian food
It's a terific place
wait too long and you 're never getting in
You would think a large restaurant like this wouldn't neet to lie
Friday night around 8:30, early by NY dining standards, two friends and I decided to try out this big, new place
Not a mob scene by any standard
We were told by the front door hostess since we didn't have a reservation, it would be about 45mins for a table, but we could wait at the lounge and they would get us when our table was ready
we gave the name and were off to cocktails
1 hour later we asked about our table
the restaurant is so big we thought perhaps they couldn't find us
We were told by the large fellow with the ear piece that they know we are here
thats all
After 2 hours and 8 drinks later we finnaly had to get something to eat

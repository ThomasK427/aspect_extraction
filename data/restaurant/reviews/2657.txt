It is a nice place to go with friends for lunch
It's a great place on the Upper East Side that you can visit with out having to go south of 86th Street
the food is very consistent
the pasta is delicious
i am a big fan
you can always order in
Overall, Ecco-La is an average Italian, and an old standard on the upper East side
However, I tried the risotto for the first time recently and WOW
You've got to try it!
they used to sell heavenly croissants and brioches, but they stopped making them and now their selection is limited to muffins and scones
I can no longer recommend a visit to the bakery
unless you like overpaying for pedestrian baked goods
My girlfriend and I went here for brunch, and every aspect of the experience was a disappointment
The portions are small and overpriced, and I have had bigger shots of whiskey than the glass of orange juice I was given
The waiter never came back to check on us or refill coffee, he got one of the orders wrong, and we both left wondering what we were going to eat when we got home
Plus the seating is so cramped that we had no choice but to learn all about a couple next to us who had just met through an online dating service
If you're trying to impress a date, take them somewhere else
Wife and I had roast beef sandwiches at Yura one afternoon
It's served cold with carmelized onions atop, with mashed potatoes on the side and it's the best darn thing this side of the Hudson
I should also note their pastries and cakes are all fantastic
Bon appetit!
What I mean by awful price is the actual dollar amount and the time wasted waiting to receive it! If you are prepared to spend a fortune for a brownie, and have the time to wait to receive, by all means dine, or take-out, from Yura
You'll never be disappointed by the savory or sweet choice you make, so wallet and time be damned! In fact, they have the best roast beef sandwhich and pecan square I've ever tasted!
nice place for dinner or lunch, great veal, risotto and pasta, love the salads too, good wine selection
the service is fabulous, very accomodating and polite and professional-they really make it a point to host and take care of you which is one reason dining is a pleasure there! the ambiance is pleasant and crisp!
Chinatown East has all of the standard Chinese dishes with some sushi and thai inspired ones as well
While service is typically quick, there are times when it seems to take quite a while
They have an early bird special with a number of selections, plus soup or soda for $10
95
Lightining speed delivery too!
I ordered the special of the day which was described as Shrimp, Scallops, Calamari, Clams, Mussels and Lobster Tail over Linguini
I got a bowlful of these awful Baby Clams and two tiny Langostinos
It was one of the more expensive things on the menu
When I told the waiter that I was unhappy, he just looked at me like a Deer in headlights and walked away
These People Are Pathetic!! They have no sense of quality or integrity
Cozy, very consistent, good for locals, food is always fresh and flavorful
A long time favorite
i still like this place
its comfortable and food is fine quality
i think the service has slipped as of late and cost cutting seems to be on the owners mind
The pasta used to much fresher
my major complaint - the little wine glasses
you used to be able to order a bootle of wine and have larger breathable glass - not any more
i was told they broke to often in the washer
you know what - then just buy more when they break - thats life
The service was terrible, and the food was equally lousy
We sat right near a buffett, and watched as people from the bar picked up pieces of food, sniffed them, and placed back down
Also, the iced tea tasted like vingegar, so we refused to drink it, yet they still charged us
Overall, cute place with poor service, and even worse food
Do not recommend!
Been to Italy 4 times, and this place reminded me of why I love it so much
Food - fabulous, al dente pasta, fresh seafood, authentic to the core
Service - traditional male italian waiters, efficient and friendly
Price - haven't found a better deal in the city, almost felt guilty not paying more
Decor - warm, cozy, like a country side trattoria
EXCELLENT, GO
Delicioso and moderate price
Nice cozy atmosphere and friendly staff
Food is great !!!
The sign outside said, 26 beers on tap, however the bartender was unable to pull a pint from any of them
Half of them were too foamy and the other half were not working
The wings were overcooked and dried
The service was very slow and unresponsive
The bar was quiet and relaxed
There are too many better bars around this area to visit this one again
The place is a dump, stools are torn, but the beer selection is great
The bartender is fun to chat with, and the place is usually quiet,
But I can't help feeling like an alcoholic sitting there
There is a sense of desperation from people who sat here
There are plenty of other places to go in the neighborhood
The wings used to be great, but somehow it went downhill last year
Either it's completely over cooked, or it's greasy and not fried properly
In Short Luca Marcato started culinary school in Milan at 16, and he's been cooking Italian food ever since
After working for the celebrated Tuscan restaurateur Pino Luongo, Marcato opened his own candlelit eatery and took control of the kitchen
Now customers nibble breadsticks in a small yellow-walled room and order mushroom risotto, lamb shank with polenta, and tiramisu
A Milan poster serves as a reminder of home, as does the prominent display of wine bottles
I have lived in the neighborhood all my life, and have been eating at Luca for 5 or 6 years
The food is consistently great and at a reasonable price
The owner is extremely nice, and even though service is sometimes a little slow, the staff is wonderful
It can sometimes be a little loud, but I find that the noise just adds to the restaurant's charm
My family and I visit New York once a year and always go to Luca's
He isn't just a very good chef, he is also very friendly
The food has always been great and I have tried a cross section of the menu
My husband loves the lamb ragu, my son and I love the risottos and my daughter has loved the gnocchi for about five years now
We must have been eating there for over five years now and the standard hasn't dropped
They don't know when we are going to be there so we could have 'caught them out' but it has never happened
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone
I just dined at Luca this past week and really enjoyed my meal
I was with 3 friends and everything we ordered was fantastic
A very welcoming restaurant
I lived in Italy for many years and I find it difficult to find pasta this good in New York
The Owner of Luca could not be nicer
My fiancee and I had a great dinner last week
The grilled vegetables weere great for an appetizer
I had the chicken stuffed with goat cheese
It was ok, nothing special, but being able to people watch and enjoy a decent meal, is worth it to come here
Went to Luca this past weekend and enjoyed a great dinner
The food was wonderful! I highly recommend the anitpasto platter--four of us shared it as an appetizer and it was more than enough
The service was good and atmosphere was nice, but a little loud
I'll definitley go again!

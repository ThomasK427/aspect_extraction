The arrogant maitre'd was annoyed when i asked about sitting down those tables are for other reservations low and behold those tables were still open as my wife and I finished dinner
Ive been to many restaurants in my day and this steak had more fat than i've been accustomed too
Just wait until you get the bill we didn't break a window we bought a house
At last, a steakhouse that is more clubby than manly
A perfect place to take the wife for a good steak, great value winelist and spectacular service
Instead of a loud, dark, claustrophobic setting, my wife and I were treated to a gorgouse floor to ceiling glass room, well-spaced out tables and attentive and knowledgable service
As a fan of the Luger style, there will be no more car service to Brooklyn for me, just a quick cab ride
Hot seafood appetizer is a must have!
Blair Perrone is -overpriced-, period
The staff is great but the food leaves much to be desired
For the prices they charge, there should be something special about every dish, that is not the case, you'd be better off taking the same dollars and cooking the meal at home
The pricing is out of this world
asked for dressing for the tomatoes Onion,check came and they charged $2
50-6 anchovies were $2
75
Steak on siziling plater with so much butter you could not taste the steak also pre-cut so you had to eat very fast-medium rare became well done in 10 minutes
25% higher then the Palm down the street and 75% less taste
I ate here on 12/8/05 very good, I'am impressed! Old location of Ruth Chris on 2nd Ave
Beautiful decor excellant service
We had the porter house for 4 and it feed all 5 of us and had some left over
The side dishes could be a little bigger but that was the best steak I have ever had and I've been to top steakhouse before, You name them I've been there! Let's see if they keep up the good work! Peter Luger's better watch out I think we have a new jack in the city!!!!!!!
I just tried this for the first time and was thoroughly impressed
The restaurant is just as great as the store and covers all the bases - great food, great ambience and great service! I would especially recommend the burrata, branzino and the classic sicilian dessert - i can't remember the name but it's covered in almond paste and it's delicious
I am a huge fan of Agata and Valentina's store, so I am thrilled that the restaurant opened right across the street
I don't know when the other reviewer last visited, but although Agata and Valentina Restaurant was semi-self-service at the start, they switched to full service few months ago
When I went for dinner we had full (and great!) waiter service and only one check
The food was excellent and authentic
The waitress told me that their dessert chef was trained in Sicily
I have been to Sicily, and the desserts at Agata are just as good, if not better than anything I had in Sicily
And I love the night-time atmosphere of this place! The lighting is seductive, and the space is beautiful
People are finding out about it, and the night crowd grows every time I walk by
I highly recommend this restaurant to Italian food lovers
The neighborhood was positively buzzing with the news about the opening of A V's new restaurant
After years of purchahing foodstuffs from the shop across the street, this was HUGE
But unfortunately, several visits have proven the restaurant is nowhere near as pleasant as the shop itself
You have to pay two separate bills - one for the drinks a server brings to you and then one for the food you collect from the buffet
It's very annoying
Then the staff behind the buffett just haven't gotten their groove yet, so you order your food and wait five minutes while it sits behind the glass on a plate, getting cold
I'll go back in a few months, in the hope they've worked it out, but the early signs show it just didn't live up to the hype
This place has the worst Chinese food I've ever had
The service was terrible, I came with two friends and we got our dishes at least 5 minutes apart
The beef was extremely fatty and undercooked so I was stuck with eating just the vegetables, of which there were few
My friend who finished her whole meal was sick the next day
Dinner came out to about $14/person, but I've had much better food at 4 dollar hole-in-the-wall places
Definitely not recommended
Unlike the array of cookie-cutter Chinese restaurants in Manhattan, Mamagoo's is like a Chinatown restaurant transported to the Upper West Side
The dishes have a fresh, home made taste - not too salty or greasy at all
The dim sum is hands down the best you'll have outside of Chinatown
Try the sticky rice in lotus leaves, and finish with the almond jellow for dessert - if you don't like these dishes then you probably don't like real Chinese food! The decor is clean and modern, making Mamagoo's one of the few Chinese restaurants where you don't need delivery to enjoy
Prices per dish are a few dollars more than your average Chinese take out, but you get what you pay for
They have great deals at lunch--I love the Basil Tofu dish! Can't wait to go back
Their noodle dishes are also excellent!
We went there for dinner on a saturday night and to my suprise the place was totally empty
After reading all these reviews on citysearch, we thought it would have been packed
But maybe they were having a slow night, it began with such delay in getting the menu's, it just didnt feel like anybody really cared about us over there, which was actually very shockiing, they should've been very attentive and warm, so that we leave happy
anyway, then the food came out after almost an hour, we were being very patient, we had the standard chicken tikka masala, but even the food failed to impress us, it was like bland chicken chunks thrown in heated tomato ketchup
I think the tv dinner was a much better, cheaper choice for us
Not recommended what so ever
While this restaurant has been much advertised with fanfare, I decided to check it out for real along with a client of mine
We were promptly seated, service was good, staff was friendly and food was excellent
They do have the courtesy to ask you how hot or spicy you want your meal to be, which helps as I'm not too familiar with Indian cuisine
Really no complaints on this one, though Im surprised how the previous reviewer had the patience or time to wait over 2 hours for his food
He must have plenty of time at hand!!!
My girlfriend dragged me here last Saturday for our date night
It was very busy when we got there but the host had us sat after a 10 minute wait
We ordered a mojito and a mango martini and they were delicious
For appetizers we ordered Chicken Samosas and Lasooni Gobi and for main course we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Pasanda and Saag Paneer they were all just scrumptious
The place was jammed but our server was prompt and friendly
The music selection was great, so we blew off desert and had another round of drinks at the bar
All in all, this place is fantastic and we plan to go back, but I would suggest do make a reservation before going
Never had such terrible service in Manhattan
We waited half an hour just to get menus, and watched another table of 10 people leave because they had been ignored by the (single) waiter
We got appetizers after 50 minutes
They forgot my drink order
Our table got our entrees after an hour and forty minutes, and they forgot my order
The waiter didn't even bother to come over and apologize
Flee this place
This is such a gem amongst Indian Restaurants with great decor, ambience much like the W Hotel in Times Sq or a upscale South Beach establishment
The service was prompt a very unusual trait for Indian restaurants, the menu was extensive and the food was also great since i have been to every indian Restaurant from London, NYC, L
A and San Francisco
I would recomend this to anyone who appreciates Indian cuisine
Last night, I treated my parents to dinner at Mint for their anniversary
My mom, who loves Indian cuisine, said that the entres at Mint were probably the best she had tasted
No doubt, the tandoor lamb chops grilled to perfection were the best we had ever tasted
Service was prompt, had to wait a few minutes to be seated as the place was busy
The waiter was very friendly and helpful in providing details about some of the exoctic dishes
Soothing ambiance and ample wine list
Overall, amazing dining experience
My parents were thrilled
Listen up
I've been to all the best Indian restaurants on both coasts, London and of course India
I've also been to a few hole in the wall joints that were quite good too
So I do not say the following lightly, I think Mint is highly over-rated
The poultry and seafood were not very fresh and were paired with your typical uninspired/bland sauces
Prices are on the high side, service was ok
On a positive note the decor is unique as far as Indian establishments go, though I do not really care to eat in basements as the views are non existent and a stuffy atmosphere pervades
With so many other choices around you can safely skip this one with no regrets
As a side note I would like to say that CitySearch seems to offer it's readers a more honest review experience than sites such as Menupages which I have personally noticed, heavily edit and thereby distort reviews
I have been going to Mint for about 4 months now and its absolutely great! Highly suggest Lamb Nilgiri and Veg/Non-Veg Samosa's
Also great service, good value and even better lunch specials!!! Highly Recommend this place!

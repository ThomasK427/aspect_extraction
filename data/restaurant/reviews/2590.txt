The mashed potatoes are particularly good; ditto for the highly rated burgers
MY WIFE AND I LUNCH AT JOE ALLEN QUITE OFTEN, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE IN TOWN FOR A SHOW
THE SERVICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN EXCELLENT AND THE FOOD VERY GOOD - WE ESPECIALLY ENJOY THE CAJUN CHICKEN SANDWICH
THE ATMOSPHERE IS CASUAL AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE NOISE - BUT I COULD IMAGINE IT BEING DISTRACTING DURING A DINNER
ALL AND ALL, I FEEL THAT JOE ALLEN IS ONE OF THE FINER NYC CASUAL STYLE RESTAURANTS AND WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR GOOD FOOD AND GOOD VALUE
I've eaten at Joe Allen several times before going to the theater
It's one of the few restaurants in the theater district where I feel I'm getting good enough food for what I've paid
I've always had excellent food there, especially the steak and the salad with rich homemade blue cheese dressing
There is also a chocolate dessert to die for
Great burgers
Great ambience
Lotsa fun here
Tough to get in in the evening
I made a 6:15 reservation explaining we were coming in from LI by car
We were 15 minutes late, but were seated promptly! Unfortunately the first thing we noticed was that the noise level was horrendous the tables too close together
However the waiter was friendly, professional and served us promptly
The food was excellent!
They got us out in time for the theatre without ever rushing us
Now if only they would install carpeting acoustical tiles on the ceiling I wouldn't hesitate to go back again!
We've gone to Joe Allen pre and post theater and on all occasions, JOE ALLEN rates supreme
The atmosphere is electric, service is excellent and the food good (not great)
It's a fun place to take parents, out of town guests and anyone you care to entertain
Highly recommended when going to the theater
It's a night out that will be memorable
You just may see a celebrity or two
,
I agree with michaelm730, the staff was abit abrupt
sort of felt I was imposing on them for being there
Food is very good
I recommend going there while the shows are in progress
it feels more like a neighborhood restaurant, and they're nicer too
Maybe they don't like the pre-show customers
WHILE VISITING ON STAURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2002, DAUGHTER AND I PHONED TO GET RESERVATIONS
THE HOSTESS WAS VERY GRACIOUS AND APOLOGETIC FOR BEING FILLED
AT HER SUGGESTION, WE WENT TO THE BAR AND FOUND TWO EMPTY SEATS
I WAS SEATED NEXT TO THE BAR MANAGER - HE WAS SOOOOO HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY
OUR BARTENDER WAS JUST AS NICE
I ORDERED DUCKLING AND MY DAUGHTER HAD THE SALMON
THE FOOD AND DRINKS WERE FANTASTIC - BEST DUCKLING I'VE ORDERED ANYWHERE
WE SAW HENRY WINKLER
AFTER WE EATEN, OUR HOSTESS CAME AND TOLD US A TABLE HAD OPENED, JUST AS SHE HAD PROMISED
SHE WAS A DELIGHT
WE HAD TICKETS TO THE THEATER; WISHED WE HAD JUST STAYED AT BAR THE ENTIRE EVENING
THE BARTENDER WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF OUR GENEROUS GRATUITY (I WAS A SERVER FOR TWENTY YEARS) AND WAS SINCERELY THRILLED
I like Joe Allen
The food is usually very good but I have to comment that the waitstaff is not
They seem like the are too preoccupied to give good service
I don't mind if they are all aspiring actors but when you have a job, do it well
Other than that, no complaints
This place was great! I heard about it on Rosie, and I thought that I might try it while in NYC
I went to it after I saw the Producers
I ordered the chicken sandwich with cajun mayo
It was really tasty
While in the restaurant, I spotted Peter O'Toole and the father on The Wonder Years
As I was walking out, this other man was coming in
I realized that it was Brad Oscar, the star of the Producers
I had my picture taken with him
It was a blast
I've been to Joe Allen several times and it is likely the best casual restaurant in the city
If you want plush and pricey, go elsewhere
If you want great food, great service, moderate prices, and an occasional celebrity sighting, this is the place
The menu is a mouth-watering variety of new and old favorites--not the least of which is the best steak tartare in the universe--good wines and ab-fab desserts
Make reservations; Joe Allen doesn't have a two-hour waiting list of out-of-towners jamming the bar
It is indeed a welcome respite from the usual chaos at theatre district dining emporia
Excellent location
Great food
Excellent desserts! A must after shows
Also visit location in Miami
as good
if not better
The bartenders at Joe Allen's make the BEST and most PERFECT Martini you have ever tasted! Those vodka martinis go down so smooth and way too easy
By the way, the food is awesome!
In Brasil, with that kind of service they would be out of the market in no time
Manager is rude, waiters are acting like they are doing you a favor? Do they actually expect to get a tip for the service they provide? Bad! really, really bad!
They have got a Saturday buffet from 11 to 4
Don't know about other days
$10!! The food was very good
Nice mix of pasta, fish, meat, etc
Excellant desserts! Very convenient to Times Square
Not big on ambience, decor, or service but if you go upstairs to the 2nd level eating area and order off of the bar menu, you can enjoy a shell steak, rice and beans, and potatoes for 10$
Excellent for the Times Square area and much better than what surrounding restuarants have to offer
it's one of the cheapest eats in the city and the food is not bad if you sit at the bar only - they have a decent chicken and/or beef tender tips but they cook with a lot of garlic so beware
For about six bucks and change you get the meal with fried potatoes black beans and rice and an all you can eat salad bar
So if you're broke this is the place to be
the bar is small and fills up fast
Go by yourself and chow
For cheaper and better food, Rice 'n Beans is your alternative
For classy and yes, better food, either Plataforma or Plantation will knock your socks off
The decor is dingy and old, and the food quality wasn't bad but it didn't impress, either
Nothing like getting tap water with old ice cubs to set the mood, I guess
The food was fairly decent, however the service was deplorable
The attitude of the hostess (owner) left a bad taste in my mouth
The decor was somewhat overwhelming and the seating arrangements were not well thought out
I know that some have had mixed reviews but I recently went with a group of 7 individuals, were seated promptly, food was outstanding! service was GRAND! I definitely would recommend!  Prior to that I went with a friend of mine a few years back and the food and service was still GREAT
The service was horrendous
Out of 6 people, 2 of us had our orders completely wrong and our waiter never came back to ask us how we were doing
The portions were ridiculously small and the food was not that great
The worst part of the night was the hostess who seemed so bitter and unpleasant
And when we thought the night could not get any worse, we had to contend with the hostess and waiter continually harrassing us about their tip
We even caught the hostess talking about us and making fun of our ethnicity

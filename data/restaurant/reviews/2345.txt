And under $10  for a homemade, healthy meal w/dessert! I will definitely go back
Excellent value! Enjoy!
We used to order from the 9th ave
street location every single day for food at work, but every time they would have a problem with our order
We finally resorted to faxing in a written order so they couldn't possibly screw it up, but they managed to do that and continue to do that on the rare occassion when we still order from them
Unfortunately the food is delicious
I've called many times to try to figure out a way to help them get their act together, but I've given up after the fifth time explaining that they forgot something on our order
A good upper east side deli from which to order late night
In Short Grace herself is a Balducci, the famed family of upscale food purveyors
So it's no surprise that this neighborhood market is such an institution, brimming with organic produce, fresh baked breads, artisanal cheeses, rows and rows of shelved foods and a long, colorful prepared food takeaway area selling mostly Mediterranean-inspired dishes by the pound
Customers pick up a gift basket for special occasions or order catering
Did you ever try and get around this place with a shopping cart? The best and nicest people are those behind the prepared food counter
They're helpful, friendly and sincere
There are no sweets at the bakery counter and has anyone ever heard a cashier say thank you?
It's a great place for a quiet birthday dinner
The service was fantastic and the staff even sang happy birthday to my guest along with ice cream and brownie with a candle
Even though some say it's pricey, I find it a treat to splurge from time to time
Overall, I've never been disappointed
I just wish the marketplace wouldn't close so early, so that I could do some shopping after dinner
I used to adore shopping at Grace's and still do for FABULOUS fresh fruits
Everything from Mangoes and Guava to exotic melons and 3 kinds of cherries (Bing, Ranier and Sour)
The prepared food is also nice - and of course, pricey
Since I live closer to Citarella and Agata Valentina, which is slightly better quality, I have pretty much stopped going to Grace's
Grace's is a treat, but I have found that almost everything there is more expensive than it is at Citarella, and if anything Citarella is better quality, so I have all but stopped going to Grace's
There are some things about Grace's that make it superior
First of all, they have a lot of produce items that other stores don't have, such as baby brussel sprouts
There are other specific items that I can only find at Grace's but for the most part it is simply too overpriced for me to choose it over Citarella, only a few blocks uptown from it
If you like normal NY thin slice, this place is the best
One of the best pizza's I've ever had
and I've had LOTS
I've been going to this little joint for over 17 years since I was in Junior Highschool
and they've been consistently top-notch
I'll walk 20 blocks out of my way just to have a slice here
One of the best slices of pizza around! I used to live right around the corner, and I still come by for their pizza after moving!
kind of smaller than regular pizza but it just melts in your mouth
their pasta dishes are a little too salty and their vegetable pizza has a little too much oil on it but very good
their beef patties are good too
John and Tony's has GREAT pizza
Whenever we go out we always end up for a slice at John and Tony's
I never had anything else there, but I trust their pizza
Oh how I wish I was drunk right now
This place has great pizza and there is a small room in the back of the pizzaria which has a feeling as if you're in someone's living room or warmly finished basement
It is a nice place to get a quick reasonable priced meal, but feel as if you really went out for dinner
The sicilian slices are great
gotta get a corner piece, extra crispy
There is a special dish with chicken and artichokes which is awesome
Don't recommend the vodka sauce because i think they poured a whole bottle in when making it
too strong tasting! The white clam sauce is good here too
but it makes for a damn fine slice in a late night pinch
but it's makes for a damn fine slice in a late night pinch
Delizia is a great place to have a great meal for a great price
It has the greatest pizza you will ever taste and some of the most delicious italian specialties
The staff is great
and you can even have a great party there
Delizia is definatley the best
Its hard getting old school pizza these days
Eveything today is chicken pizza and salad pizza
This Delizia has thiese but is also know for its famous great white
They invented the white slice and it is to kill for
Just like the old country
This friendly neighborhood place has great pizza and other specialty dishes
Enjoy a casual dinner in the small back dining room
The baked zitti is one of my favorites
Great basic pizza and take out is open late on the weekends
The setting you would expect for a pizza parlor
Thank you Italian Village
Food is consistently great
pizza, chicken rolls, anything
delicious
Hours are great and late delivery is key
Definelty recommend
ENJOY
The Scene Take the two flights upstairs, passing terra-cotta-like walls, to the dramatic enclosed terrace, where oversized windows look up to the sky and the roof gardens of nearby doorman buildings
You'll be sitting next to local families, teens clutching the latest Louis Vuitton bag and couples who primp for pizza
Staff is quietly attentive
The Food The Italian menu has been created from a crew of chefs from the homeland, yet the food is mostly typical: Caesar salad, buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes, spaghetti with plum tomatoes
A stellar appetizer is an uncommon rendition of carpaccio--thin sheets of lobster served with arugula, hearts of palm and corn--and the most interesting homemade pasta is ravioli filled with black truffles
Fabulous thin pizza is the claim to fame, prepared in an oven made from volcanic lava from Vesuvio
The house-specialty pizza--topped with caviar or truffles--is as decadent as pizza gets
Excellent sangria, awesome artichoke/shallot salad, incredible thin crust margherita pizza! Great atmosphere, upper level is more spacious with a nice view, great attentive service
Will definitely go again next time I'm in town! Would recommend to anyone I know who is coming to NY
A group of my friends and I had dinner on the rooftop and enjoyed both the atmosphere and the food
Our waiter was clueless and seemed overwhelmed that we were such a large party
As the sky darkened the ambience improved and we enjoyed the lit room and balmy weather
The food was definitely NOT fabulous; my pizza was forgettable
Our appetizers were small in portions and NOT good for group sharing
The only person who truly enjoyed their food was a friend who ordered the pasta
Go for the atmosphere, not for the food!
Serafina Pizza
I can still remember the time when they opened up first
We were happy to have a place like this around the corner
My wife liked the servers and the hostesses(or managers)
Everybody was so nice
It was a very nice feeling being welcome by a Beautiful hostess
All of them were tall probably eastern European
The waiters were very nice
When ever we had a problem it was sold right away
But what is happening lately
Last week i saw a manager talking on cell phone the whole night
Yelling in italian

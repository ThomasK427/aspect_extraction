they do not play music at this restaurant
the service is very good and attentive, but I personally cannot see past not playing music
its so dull
We discovered this place on a rainy Monday night
We were welcomed with open arms and treated like the family
The food is good italian home cooking without any extras
If you are looking for a friendly family Italian restaurant without airs or graces, this is the place
This is the epitome of the neighborhood restaurant
When you look in through the window you wonder why this old looking place with zebra red wallpaper is always packed with people (and why they haven't updated the wallpaper
)?? I'm glad my husband and I stroked our curiousity because the pasta dishes are so good, my mouth is watering as I write this! The tricolor tagalini pasta dish is amazing
the pasta is so fresh and really homemade! The chilled asparagus with vinegarette is delicous! When the soft shell crabs are in season, they are a must too! We live in the neighborhood and have been back 5 times since April! Tell you anything?
The zebras are the most memorable thing about this place, there's no doubt
Then again, they're so very striking that that implies nothing bad about the food, which is a very serviceable Italian
Not unduly fancy, this is a place where you can get red wine or white -- but a request for pinot grigot is met with a raised eyebrow
If you can deal with that -- and enjoy the old-school atmosphere -- you'll have a blast
I recently moved to the Upper East Side and came across Tang Tang
Not knowing if this restaurant served authentic Chinese cuisine, too my amazement, the food was absolutely delicious
The service was great and the people were very friendly
This is definitely a good place to dine if you looking for someplace casual with delicious foods
Tang Tang is my favorite chinese place
I moved to the UES just so I could be within delivery distance
Everything ordered is delicious! I drag everyone to Tang Tang and no one has ever been disappointed
Their delivery service is amazingly fast and the food is still piping hot
I can't even try another place
I was excited when I first moved to my Upper East Side neighborhood that there seemed to be an authentic Noodle house just bnlock from my new apartment
Seems, is the operative word here
Tang Tang churns out a-step-above-mall quality Chinese grub
While it is cheap, it is not tasty nor satisfying
The dumplings were thick and rubbery (not at ALL delicate) and filled with greasy meat
The noodle soups, while large in portion size, did not have anything special going on
With so many GOOD NYC Chinese restaurants (though, sadly NOT on the Upper East Side which is an Asian wasteland
) I wouldn't ever waste my time with Tang Tang
Nicest, most charming diner I've ever encountered
Polished and inviting, the kind of place you'd want to linger all the way to dessert
Incredible selection, morning, noon and night (as well as all-night)
Excellent seafood values in addition to classic, 24 hour diner fare
The Skinny Captain cheeseburger with cottage cheese is a great hang-over sponge
Hard-working owners and staff and excellent neighborhood delivery
I would move from the neighborhood if this place ever vanished
Good Authentic Chinese food is hard to come by around the Upper Eastside
But, Scechuan Kitchen definitely has great food
The service is quick and responsive
However, quality is not sacrificed for speed
Neither is quantity
Inexpensive and Big portions of quality Chinese food
What else can you ask for? Well, the only draw back is that the restaurant is only take-out
Other than that, its a great place to grab Chinese food on the Upper Eastside
I ordered the shrimp, goat cheese quesadillas
Im allergic to mushrooms, so ordered it without
My entre arrived WITH mushrooms, I sent it back
They brought me out a new entre minutes later and I thought all was okay
I was wrong
The entre was sub-par to say the least
When taking one of my last few bites, I bit into a mushroom
As it turns out, they didn't re-make the meal, but picked out the mushrooms
The waiter had the nerve to ask how he could make it up to us, (obviously I told him to take it off the bill)
He said the manager would not allow him to do so
To recap- I ordered a dish without the ingredient to which I am allergic; they screwed it up, pretended to fix it; then they wouldnt do anything about it
Like I said, despicable
do not go there!!!
We all bought margaritias 30 mins before happy hour was over and they fought with us about getting the happy hour price when our bill came
they refused to give it to us so we just didn't leave a tip
The ambience is horrible
they played the same bad Latin song on loop
The food is not worth the price
DO NOT GO HERE
I've been to this restaurant twice in a couple of months and both times the service was unbearably slow
The chips and salsa are good, but the meal is not worth the wait
Went to this restaurant with a large group of people
I would like to be able to give everybody's rating of the food, problem is not everybody ended up getting their meal
The service was absolutely the WORST I have ever seen
Completely unacceptable
Desserts came out with appetizers, meals were just forgotten and then they tried to charge one person $2 for a little side of mole sauce
Margaritas pretty good at least
Made for a funny story
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! The food is terrific, the margaritas are delicious and the prices are reasonable! Specials every night of the week, and the waitstaff are awesome
Food here is terrible
Probably the most over-rated restaurant I have had the displeasure of having eaten in
Salsa is bland, I have tasted better refried beans out of a can, the cheese doesn't even taste like cheese - it takes more like playdoh
They obviously use inferior ingredients that I would not even serve to my in-laws! Taco Bell serves better food at half the price
The only reason I can even see anyone stepping foot in this place is for some decent maragaritas
Notice, I said decent margaritas
There is nothing Mexican about this place
Whoever said that this was the best Mexican joint on the Upper East Side would not be correct even if this restaurant was the ONLY Mexican on the UES
Skip this joint
be forewarned, you might not even have room for your entree b/c the free and unlimited chips and salsa are so good
burritos are excellent, good black beans and rice, friendly and fun atmosphere and service
I don't understand why people think this restaurant is worth going to
The food is mediocre to dissappointing
I've given them maybe 4 tries and had bad service each time
And I always feel like I'm paying too much money
Skip it
Mary Ann's does not pass the texmex test! If the salsa tastes like spaghetti sauce, you know you are in the wrong place
MaryAnne's is reliable - you know what you're gonna get
But, come on, it's heavy, cheese-baked fare
Very average in all respects
Not nearly as fresh and flavorful as other NYC Mexican restaurants that didn't even make the list
Arriba Arriba has much better food, margs, and atmosphere with slightly higher prices, but well worth it
The fact that this restaurant has a better user rating than Maya means more people go for the cheap eats and Rita's than REAL Mexican food
Maty Ann's is Tex/Mex and it is a chain restaurant

We also have a cappuccino afterwards, all for $15! I was very happy and would recommend their lunch to all
I basically like this place lots for food but I need to get more volume for any foods
Their portion are just too small for Italian food
Since it is Japanese owned place, their portion might be very Japanese size
Last time when I went there, I spent $100 for wine, antipasta, entry, and deseert
It is just little price for that size
Basta Pasta is a great place to come with a friend or a group of people
The price is moderate and the food is always tasty
Some dishes are tastier than others (I love the tender baby crispy chicken)
Even the salad dressing is great
Our friends always thank us for recommending this great find
Oh and the wait staff is the friendliest in Manhattan- they ALL greet you on your way in and on your way out
The restaurant, its food and decor can be summed up in two words: PLAIN and CLEAN
I guess that's what Japanese people value because there were a lot of Japanese patrons
Don't be misled
This is NOT a trendy Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant
A couple dishes mixed Japanese and Italian flavors together
But most dishes were regular Italian fare
Though I wouldn't recommend you go for the Italian food, if you want to take a group of friends to a clean and decent tasting restaurant in the Union Square area this is it
My dinner at BP was a surreal experience
My pasta was perfectly italian (al dente italian style, NOT American al dente), and my steak was perfectly Japanese (Rare in Japan= Medium in the US)
Service was good and supportive
The menu in Japanese/Italian/English was a nice touch
The room was full and remained full on a Thursday night
50-50 mix of Anglo and Asian people
The food was good, the price was nice, and the space is a nice twist on the open kitchen concept
I liked that the bar seemed far away
Though there was some fusion-esque menu items NO WHERE does the place claim to be a fusion restaurant
The Japanese know how to deliver good service
I'm surprised that they have also learnt to cook good authentic Italian cuisine
We always come on a weekend without reservations
Last time we ate here, I was trying to sit down at a table that was reserved for Susan Sarandon
I am haapy to report that I am as well treated as the celebrity
That's the greatest extent of the fusion that I've experienced here
Most pastas are purely Italian, although there are a few that incorporate some Japanese influence
You have to look to the (overly-expensive) entrees to get more of a fusion flavor, and even those have a good amount of purely Italian choices
The pastas are quite good, but are prepared firmer in most dishes than al dente, so be aware of this if you like softer pasta
Portions are medium at best; there definitely are better values for good Italian food in the City
Menu is interesting and varied; one would not get bored eating here often
Service is as cold and utilitarian as one might expect from the average Asian restaurant -- perhaps familiarity with this is why the clientele is so abundantly Asian?
This is basically an Italian restaurant run by Japanese people
Thought the food would be a fusion between the two cultures, but its basically plain Italian types of cuisine
Though you can't go wrong with the pasta and sauce there was nothing exceptional about their dishes nor was there much flair to anything else to this place
Their selection is limited and overall is a little too expensive for something thats pretty ordinary
Italian plates completely arranged to Japanese people
Too much PANKO called in Japanese, bread powderon any starter plates, and servers walking around to check our tables, noisy-noisy(kitchen room is in center of the restaurant)
I think we could go to real Italian restaurant which we can find easily in Manhattan
There are a lot of Japanese clients
this place offers Japanese version of Italian cuisine
For Japanese, the food tastes pretty good
Service is also pretty close to what you expect in Japan
All the wait staff are Japanese
I saw Yoko Ono dining there earlier today
I recommend trying uni (sea orchant) or tarako (cod roe) pasta
Host insisted I'd asked for a table for two, when I had walked in with two other people, held up three fingers, and said table for three please
Fine, a misunderstanding, but he insisted that it was my error in a somewhat rude way
Entrees delivered five minutes apart - not acceptable
Food is competent but recipes are uninspired and almost minimal
Very noisy room
All in all I think you can do a lot better for the money
The Scene Whether it's chilly January or sweltering August, the tile-floored dining room offers a dim, buzzing respite
The dark brown tables are packed together, ensuring swooning daters and casual diners will get to know each other
The bar serves as a comfortable neighborhood meeting place, and the streetside patio tables are coveted whenever the weather permits
The Food Classic bistro fare is the draw
Salads are quite robust--try the mix of frisee, apples, walnuts and blue cheese (no lardons or egg in sight)
The salmon tartare is also good, bested only when the house tuna tartare is available
Among entrees, the roast chicken is worthy of a cultish following, and is easily enough to feed two; the steak frites hold their own; and any lamb specials, especially braised leg, should be on the shortlist of must-trys
Fun place to be - classic Paris atmosphere, having lived there for 6 years reminds me of some of the livelier ones
Food never outstanding in the haute cuisine stakes, but reliable, tasty and not over-priced
Decent priced wine, and the sort of place you would find yourself going back to
Seems to be full of regulars, always a good sign I feel
Buzzy atmosphere and attentive friendly staff
Not the place for a quiet romantic meal, but with your regular partner or a couple of friends, worth a try - especially if you want to try something similar, but with a bit more character (ie less classy but more fun) than Pastis, Balthazar, etc
The food was average and a bit overpriced
Chicken was great but the steak was extremely salty
Our waitress was severely inattentive and the food delivery was rather poor
There were 5 of us and the entrees were delivered piecemeal over the course of almost 15 minutes without any form apology for the error
when i'm in chelsea and can not decide where to go
I always find myself in Le Singe Vert
From ambiance, service and food it is worth every buck
If you dine early they have a prix fixe menu
This restaurant is one of Chelsea's gems
I've eaten here several times and every meal was wonderful
skate, escargot, Salad Nicoise
it's all amazing with a wonderful, friendly, happy staff
Consistent and excellent!  Sit with your date by the lace covered windows and share some wine on the next rainy day
I really like this cute little french bistro so much it's become and addiction
I eat there when ever I'm in Chelsea - which is often
I love the Salad Nicoise it's the best around
I haven't been there for brunch yet but, I am looking forward to doing that now that the weather is getting better
The staff is nice and inviting - not overly friendly, but efficient and up to the task
Yay for a brunch place that goes beyond the standard three menu choices
Beyond that, the food is excellent, the portions generous, and the drinks just keep coming
It's a great place to pull up a sidewalk table with three of your co-conspirators, drinking Bellinis and unraveling the universal mysteries for a couple hours
It does get awfully packed, though, so go BEFORE you shop
I really liked Singe Vert
The food is fantastic, and the wait staff is fun and attentive
I try too eat here when ever I'm in Chelsea
I also grab a hand full of business cards to hand out to my friends
it's that good!

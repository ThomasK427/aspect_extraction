They were both good, but not good enough to make Vong a restaurant I want to go back to
I think I was just expecting more from Jean Georges
It was a little pricey, but they had a great menu of innovative cocktails
The food was really really good, we went for the $20 lunch
The portions were a little small, but the taste was amazing
Really liked the peanut sauce, even bought two bottles on the way out
Vong has great food, great ambiance and a great bar! The meal can get a little on the costly side but the food and dining experience is well worth it! My salut to the chef for the delightful menu!
A Holy Grail of sorts for fusion cuisine
Excellent and innovative combinations
Vong is a great place to go with friends, family, or whoever
There was a ten minute wait with a reservation, but the bar kept us entertained
The food is delicious
Very flavorful and off the beaten path
Although the portions are not huge, I left satisfied
It is an interesting combination of two entirely different cuisines
But I think it might suit the French-loving palate more than the loyal Thai adherent
Very good decoration though
I absolutely loved this place
I found it a fun, unbeat place to hang out with my friends
Every bite I took of the food we ordered made me wanting more
I actually dreamed about my crispy vegetable rolls
Chicken with sweet rice was so wonderful I left trying to figure out how to recreate it at home! The food is not overpriced and is amble! The only thing I didn't think was worth the money was my Tea Infused Martine
Our waiter was knowledgeable and our water glasses were filled even if they weren't empty
Dinner was nicely spaced out and we spent about 3 hours chatting feeling nonrushed! I would recommend this for first date dinners since the atmosphere is dark, but not too romantic
would give you guys a lot to talk about!! The atmosphere is more business casual
not a lot of suits
seems to cater to large parties
but, they have to eat too! And, this time, the suits are right!! Vong's food is high quality, very flavorful and different! Spring Roll and Tuna appetizers were great; the chicken and beef main courses were spectacular; desserts phenomenal! Couple that with excellent, helpful service and you've got a winner!
A great value in midtown
The prix lunch is a great way to sample the wonderfuls of the East
Although the room was tight and dark, it gave way to a warm dining experience
Not a good place to take children as power lunches are often the main stream of clients
Ever since the 2 French women managers left the service has not been up to par
Many of the other reviews attribute bad service with the French which seems to be politically correct and quite immature
Anyway, the place has it's own ambience, although somewhat loud
The quality of the food is inconsistent
The service is really unsupervised and therefore not as attentive and not as personable
Great little French place that we stumbled upon one night
Wonderful food and fantastic wine selection
Fantastic service in a romantic setting! We will be back again and again!
This place has a sexy, downtown feel, and it's (surprisingly) on 51st Street
The wine list is expansive, and they know how to do French bistro food well
I was disappointed that they did away with the delectable tuna tartar dish recently, but nothing could be better than a flight of wine and the brie honey sandwich for a light meal
I absolutely loved that they have a live jazz trio performing for weekend brunches
It's worth leaving the typical East Village brunch locations and heading uptown for
I did have to wait a good 20 minutes for a table, but the live music made the wait enjoyable
the menu has a cool option for a five or nine taster selection of wine, but beware


we told our waiter to make five selections for each of us, and he decided instead to charge us for each glass separately instead ($80 instead of $20)
Fine it was a mistunderstanding on the waiters part but we had no problem paying since we did get what we assume was a lot more wine
atleast we didnt mind until the condescending manager insinuated that we must be idiots to assume that the full glasses of wine we received were part of the tasting menu
Plus, it took 45 minutes to get the check - which by the way had two extra glasses of wine that we never ordered or received
The place had great ambiance, but the bill is a big fat con!!! Punk this place!
Nothing extraordinary, nothing really disappointing
Good wine list, OK service with no smile but I guess that's the French way? We had a hard time communicating with the waitress as she couldn't really speak English
We had mussels with white wine and cream sauce as an appetizer but it was pretty disappointing
For the main dish, my friend had the veal dish and I had today's special which was chilean seabass
both nicely presented and tasty but portions were pretty small
Our bill was about $120 with a bottle of wine
This is a very romantic little french restaurant
I wound up there late night on a tues night and was surprised to see that there was still a vibe - they serve until 4am - definitely good to know
The layout is very small and intimate with no more than 15 tables - the lighting is dim (basically candle lit) - the winelist extensive (350 options) - the food delicious - the music french - the waitstaff knowledgable
Its great for a date
I enjoyed everything - especially the food
Service was sadly French, poor
I ordered escargots and they were terrible, tasted much better elsewhere, and I've eaten them in a lot places
Entree was rack of lamb, totally unflavorful and over cooked
What a disappointment
Fries were good though
Ambience was really nice, dark, romantic, too bad the food couldn't be much better
you can't have fun! the staff is usually having a good time, the clientele is usually having a good time, the kitchen is usually putting out some good bistro food (try the foie terrine, every time), and the wine list is one of the best small lists in town
Repeat
it's hard to find someplace in midtown with a different atmosphere
i frequent le bateau ivre and the staff is always very friendly and accomodating, even if i am just having a glass of wine
i have never experienced the rudeness suggested by other reviewers
their wine selection is very good and they are generous about allowing tasting before settling on a bottle or even a glass
it's small and can get crowded, recommended to go on the early side
one complaint is they play the same beattles album most times i am there
Fantastic wine list
Over 200 different wines served by the glass
Food was very good, full of flavor and quite diverse
The best part is the atmosphere though
Reminded me of a true Paris bistro
Fun and yum
Enjoy
this is the best restaurant ive been to
the food is great, atmosphere is awesome and the service rocks
take it from someone who would eat there any day!
The decor was Art Deco and the service impecable
The hot and sour sup was scrumptious and the sesame prawns were perfect! And for a restaurant in Manhattan the prices were quite reasonable
If you want to be treated like a king or queen I reccomend this establishment
I went for lunch in this Chinese restaurant in hope of experiencing the finest Chinese in New York
What I actually got were entrees sweet enough to paralyze my tongue
The appetizer was sweet, lemon sorbet was sweet, the main dish was sweet, and the dessert was sweet (passion fruit sorbet)
The only thing worth eating were the rice and vegetables which are insignificant in making any differences to the rating
This is hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant in Manhattan
The food can best be described as fine Chinese (ex: the dumplings definitely are not the frozen ones that you get at so many of the restaurants in the Village, they have to be handmade by the chefs to taste as great as they do)
The menu encompases dishes from all regions of China including some harder-to-find specialties such as Peking Duck (which is fantastic)
The service is impeccable and is what really sets the restaurant apart

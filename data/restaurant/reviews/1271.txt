I had a frozen hot chocolate there that nearly caused a brain meltdown
The staff is incredibly friendly, the wine list is extensive with dessert wines, and the atmosphere is laid back
I particularly reccommend the peanut butter cups! Great for after dinner, or even instead of dinner
The desserts are made on the premises - amazingly delicious!
Each day is simply a fight for me to avoid going in the Chocolate Room
Why? Because I lack self-control, and they're unbelievable sweets tempt me each and everytime
I challenge anyone to go there and try
just TRY to buy one item, it can't be done
My personal favorite
the dark chocolate cupcake, or a chocolate soda
Tempt thyself and be FOREWARNED
this place will capture the chocolate lover in you, and will not let go! :-) I think I'll go get a cupcake now
When I go to a restaurant that specializes in a particular food theme -- in this case desserts and especially chocolate creations -- I expect them to excel -- why else specialize? As much as I wanted to like the Chocolate Room, the desserts were mediocre at best
House made ice cream sounded promising, but tasted more like that wretched ice milk sold as diet food in the 70s -- watery and with little flavor
Overly salty hot fudge ontop and a fairly nondescript brownie underneath did little to help
Chocolate pudding tasted like it was made from a Jell-O mix
Overall, very disappointing
The service was excellent -- our waiter was friendly and greeted every table with a gratis biscotti
I'd have to say that was the high point
Otherwise, go elsewhere
I've had better chocolate from Hersheys!
If you love chocolate, this is the place to be
The desserts are incredible
The service is always extremely friendly and reliable
The atmosphere is also very cool-perfect for a date or a bunch of friends
Everything made with chocolate here is great
The alcohol choices are lacking
Just 2 or 3 wines/ports
So I always go to Total Wine Bar afterwards, on the same block, to take care of that
The chocolate cupcakes and fondue are really amazing!
My kids go to school across the street and I work 3 blocks away
I have been there with work colleagues, with TONS of children and some designated adults and they are gracious every time
I love the food and as a person that does not drink often or regularly, I am practically addicted to their sangria
The prices are great, I almost always have the same thing, salad, salmon chimichanga, flan, coffee SANGRIA!
I've had the pleasure of dining here a few times, and each time has been to my satisfaction
The service, food, and margaritas have all been excellent
I will say that often times they make their drinks very strong (may tell your bartender / waitress to keep it mild)
Their appetizer portions are not huge, just right since the entrees are much larger
Highly recommended for late dining and happy hour (Sunday - Thurs 2x1 drinks)
In Short The subtle scent of smoke envelops the space filled with checkered tablecloths, neon-lighted signs and kitschy decor
Vegetarians quickly get the hint: Two giant outlines of pigs are painted on the red walls and small pig statuettes adorn the entrance
From chicken wings and smoked beef brisket to pulled pork and Texas links, the menu features many barbecue favorites
Sides such as collard greens and cheese grits are well-represented, and pecan pie makes an appearance for dessert
I love the ribs and the rest of their selection
They evem have a smoker or something like that
For sure i'll go back there at their place
The coke is good for drinks selection apple juice I think and lots of other stuff it is the best rib place ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Went on a very cold day and the warmth and bbq smell from the smoker inside was so soothing to our frozen faces
The atmosphere is rustic and casual and had a good sound system playing classics we all know
The pulled pork sandwich was delicious and the fries were perfect
The house BBQ sauce is amazing
The cornbread was delicous, but you must remember to ask for some
All in all it was a fun easy going dinner
We went early and it was kinda empty but around 7 it started to fill up
there is a huge bar and the servers are friendly
The decor is fun, the staff friendly but unfortunately the food just doesn't live up to expectations
I went for lunch and ordered the brisket and ended up with a pile of gristle on a portuguese roll
The fries were excellent though! (Drinks were strong for those of you who like to imbibe!) It may be a good place for happy hour but I'd skip the meals
All I can say is OUTSTANDING, from the hostesses which were very welcoming and informative, the outstanding service and the best BBQ ribs that I have every had
The ribs melt in your mouth and they have that down home flavor that leaves you saying A GREAT BIG OH YA
the best part is that you don't get hit with that welcome to New York outrageous bill at the end, very reasonable and I will be returning real soon
we went there on Saturday at pm
Got right in no real problem
Waitress was OK
Food was average
Not worth a special trip
Side dishes were not that great, and the food was only warm
Wouldn't go back
I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, it was so tender and juicy
The barbeque sauce that they have on the table is so good, I just kept putting it on my sandwhich
The setting has a good theme, your normal backyard checkered tablecloth
You can even eat next the smoker, and watch them cook the meat
The price was average, but for timesquare prices, its not a bad deal
Overall I recommend going here and trying out their barbeque
I've eaten here twice; once as take-out, once inside
The take-out was a disaster -- the food was cold and the kitchen forgot to include the sauce for the spring rolls
The fried chicken sandwich was poor -- stale bun, chicken filet was small and tough as leather
The dine-in experience was better
The pulled pork and brisket were comparable to Virgil's
Other than the mac and cheese, the sides were disappointing, though
Service was incompetent on both occasions
With Virgil's close by, why bother with this place?
gotta say that i was duly UNimpressed with this place
from reading all the other reviews, i really had my hopes up
big negatives:   - cornbread might as well be called corncake - way to dense and sugary
- baked bean side - beans were crunchy, like peanuts
and the sauce was too liquidy and flavorless
we sent it back
- st
louis style ribs - meat was tasty, sauce stinks
- other sides we tried were mediocre and full of sugar - the collard greens, sweet potatoes, the corn
big positives:  - chicken wing appetizer - flavorfull jerk sauce, chicken falls off the bone
- onion ring app - pretty standard, but tasty - brisket - well done, nice crispy flavorfull skin, tender meat - mac n cheese  so yeah, i gotta think that there are tons of better BBQ places in Manhattan than this place
i hope so!
I have been going to Spanky's on a reqular basis since June
The BBQ is the best I ever had and that is from somone who used to live down south
The service is excellent the wait staff very friendly
The prices are more then fair
Try the brisket it is the best anywhere it will melt in your mouth
Whoever smokes their meats has it down perfectly, you get the BBQ flavor without the overpowering smoke taste

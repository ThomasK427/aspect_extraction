The Scene Dawat is a relentlessly friendly place, and servers are good about navigating novices through the exotic array of dishes inspired by Madhur Jaffrey, the Indian actress and cookbook author
Little here suggests the typical New York Indian restaurant, including the spare and attractive dining room
The Food The eclectic menu surprises and exhilarates
To start, try the bhel poori, an explosive melange of puffed rice, wheat chips, fresh coriander and assorted hot and sweet chutneys--a roller derby for the palate
Main courses are as generous as they are varied--a signature dish is the Parsi-style salmon, in which the fish is rubbed with a tart coriander chutney, wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed
Another option is the heady shrimp cooked with garlic, ginger and assorted spices
Traditional dishes are also available, like a pungent lamb vindaloo, moist tandoori chicken and aromatic tandoori shrimp
There's just nothing all that great about this place
The spices are bland, the service is mediocre and tries to shoo you out the door
get much better Indian at, say, Jewel of India, or most likely at some downscale places in Jackson Heights (though I haven't tried them)
Everything was absolutely amazing from the atmosphere, to the service and of course the food
You will not find a place like this any where else in the city
great authentic food great service great atmosphere  what more can u ask from a restaurant? it will surely become one of your favorites!
The hospitality and service was phenominal
Food preperation was fantastic
Taste was GREAT
Overall Dawat is one of the best Indian restaurants i've been to
An avid fan of the traditional Indian clay oven, the tandoor, and the many specialties that come from it I decided to visit Dawat on Friday night a few weeks back
I called early and made sure that they had seating, and was greeted by a pleasant individual who noted that seating would be available
After I arrived I made sure to try the Boti Kebab Masala and the Lamb Chops, which were absolutely succulent
The waiters were prompt and courteous and I truly enjoyed my meal, will return!
As a well traveled socialite, I have had my share of Indian cuisine
From NY to San Francisco, I have been to the so-called best fine dining Indian restaurants all over the US
In NY is where things get difficult
With a plethora of places to choose from, selecting a spot with a taste that sticks out is not an easy task
Indian food has the same base anywhere you go, but its the character of the food that leaves an impression
When I say character, Im talking about the texture, the aroma, the presentation, the taste, and the authenticity
Dawat clearly provided Indian cuisine with character that proved to be unique
If you want Indian food with flavor, this is your place
all i can say is this place was phenominal from start to end
Attentive service - clean and neat atmosphere
decor is simple
food is mouth watering
the best
Dawat is one of the best restaurants ive been too - very prompt service, nice decor, wasnt too noisy, and the food was Great! The waiter was courteous enough to spend time with us to tell us his suggestions because we were unsure of what we wanted to order - and we were definately satisfied! Theyre desserts were amazing!
Great decore, fast and professional service
Good place to bring a date
I will be going back very soon
Oh
the best indian restaurant ever! where to begin? The food was super and the service was great
Busy place but worth it
We liked it so much that we returned the same night! (actually, my mom kinda left a gift there and we had to go back to retrieve it LOL)
Definitely the best place to take your family to
ok, now i've been to my share of indian resteraunts in NYC, had all types of indian food at weddings etc etc
the taste and quality of the food here is amazing
its acutally what QUALITY indian food is supposed to be
the staff was very helpful in describing the items (although i knew what they were
its fun to test them once in a while)
all in all, they do provide a creative spin on the usual indian food but without really breaking the boundries
was there for my anniversary, and the manager and head waiters came by twice to make sure we were taken care of and that everything was ok
Def worth springing the extra bucks to check it out
On a recent Saturday evenining, I treated my friends to a different type of grilling: I invited them out to dine with me at Dawat
We enjoyed many of the items prepared in the Tandoor--definitely a superior alternative to grilled steaks and burgers
The taste was superb, and the quality of the meat surpassed that of other Indian dining establishments
Afterward, we cooled off with some of the very interesting Indian desserts; the item my waiter recommended me was agreed upon to be the best tasting by the table
Dawat offers up great summer dining options, and I look forward to return and sample some of their curries
i went here, after my dad told me like every week its awsome Food was cold as hell service could have been better but its deff better then the other three indian restaraunts on 58th street
- i went march 11th for my b-day - slow service - food was ok
very spicy we told them mild - pricy  - bad birthday = (
In course of my work I travel the world over
Recently I had some business associates from India visiting us
decided to have the best indian food in new york
We were recommended Dawat by one of our office colleagues
The place lives up to its reputation as the best Indian Restaurant
The food is great,the service impeccable and the atmosphere warm and friendly
It exceeded my high expectations
which speaks volume about this place
will definitely go more often to this place
well first of all my day wasnt going good
so i decided to go to dawat
little did i know going here would make it worse
i went with a group of friends that wanted to make me feel better
we got there and were seated within 10 mins
waiter was stuckup and did not come for 10 mins
he took our drink order and came back 15 mins later and forgot my drink
then the starters were cold and had way to much salt in them
yuck
after this we dint even bother with starters instead we paid for the rest and left for another restraunt
Dawat has some very good food, unfortunately it's not very authentic indian
It's really more Indian-American fusion, than anything else
The food is very tasty, the atmosphere is quite nice, and service was excellent
Of course, it's quite expensive as well, but on the whole worth it
The food here is so good
Very flavorful and tasty
The waitstaff is pretty nice and friendly
I would highly recommend the chicken saag and the leechee martini
This place fills up quickly so make recommendations
I reserved a table for restraunt week June '05, the lady did not take my name down when I got there
Seated quickly, atmosphere is the hustle/bustle of the people/waiters around
Service is POOR, after each course, we waited 30min-1hr
Otherwise food is great for the taste buds and less on the actual burning sensation of the spice like in other less quality restraunts
I enjoy Indian food and this is the one for a must try
But the restraunt itself is quite small for a romantic setting since the tables are very close to each other, no room for intimate privacy
I went to Dawat with a couple of my friends
We made reservations and were promptly seated
The decor of the restuarant is simple, but classy
The menu is pages long (a plus) and the legend will help navigate you through it depending on your tastes
The food was really good, but my party and I did not know that rice and bread are not included in the meals
We unfortunately discovered that we would have to pay an additional 9 dollars for rice and 13 dollars for bread when the bill came
This may be typical of Indian restuarants, but quite costly given that the dishes themselves are not inexpensive

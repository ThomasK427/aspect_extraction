Pair them with full-flavored rosemary- and orange-marinated prawns and a salad of fava beans, asparagus and romano for a light supper
Skipping the homemade pastas, however, is a mistake, especially the decadent fettuccine with braised duck and herbed ricotta
Among entrees, the lamb sausage with broccoli rabe and fried sage, and the grilled swordfish with prosciutto and olive tapenade stand out
The piquant lemon tart is the perfect ending
I highly recommend this foray into Italian cuisine
Not the usual pasta/pesto/basta basta
this place ventures into something totally unique to me
Italian tapas
and they did a fine job teasing and definitely pleasing my palate
Everything was delicious, prepared just right and full of flavor--from the dishes to the dessert
I highly recommend this culinary adventure for the food, the fare, and last but not least, the flair!
Honestly, why is this wonderfully glittering place so inexpensive? What's going on? (And long may the management keep the prices so low)
I had a lovely birthday dinner here with my boyfriend, parents, and some old friends
We even spotted a minor celebrity
We had a large shared plate of high-quality appetizers (cheeses, meats, olives) that was only $8
Desserts were as low as $2 This is a great place to go if you're treating-- you'll seem very generous but not have to face a huge credit card bill later
A three-course dinner for 6 including one drink each cost only $163
The service was lovely, the atmosphere was great for out-of-towners seeking a glamorous New York night
I really hope this restaurant keeps up their insanely wonderful pricing-- in the meantime, rush out and enjoy it while it lasts!
Saturday night about 2 weeks ago, walked in around 9pm (I think) and asked if they had a table for 2
They took my name and said about 30 minutes
We walked around and came back in 20 minutes, sat at the bar and had a drink, and our table was ready 10 minutes later
We sat upstairs, which was packed with intimate, to very large and loud groups, but still nice
The waitress told us the portions were not big, so we each got an entree and shared a side
My date had water, and I had a glass of wine
We didn't walk away full, but just enough to go someplace else after for drinks and not be bloated
The best thing
my bill was UNDER $50 dollars! The cheapest dinner for the quality and calibur of restaurants I've experienced
So I'd say, make a reservation, bring a date, don't get crazy with the drinks, enjoy a nice meal and coversation and service, and leave with more money in your pocket to enjoy more overpriced drinks someplace else and have a great night, starting with a great dining experience
Read about this place and filed it in the back of my head and stumbled on it yesterday
Spur of the moment decision to eat out and we were delightfully surprised
Service was friendly and attentive
The small plates of wonderfully prepared Italian fare is a great way to taste your way through a simple but elegant menu
From cheeses to salads to well chosen pastas, meats, fish, and of course gelato!! Everything was wonderful
Can't wait for an excuse to return!
I've been to Vento a few times and always had an enjoyable dinner
They have currently changed their menu
I love it! You can taste a little bit of everything
We had a cozy corner table upstairs
Our waiter was more then helpful
A MUST GO!
We sat at the table (without menus) for a while before the waiter came over
He apologized for a taking a while, but someone else should have greeted us
The food was great, and came out quickly
After they brought the check and we were sitting for a few minutes finishing dessert
TWO people came by to take the bill, but we hadn't put the money down yet
The hostess SLOWLY walked by our table scribbing something on paper
They were obviously waiting for us to leave and we felt very rushed at the end of the meal
The atmosphere was nice (tables were a bit too close together) and trendy, but waiters seemed rushed
A group of six of us had an 8:30 reservation, they sat us pretty quick, just be advised you must have your whole party there before they will seat you
Dinner was good, service was good
The bar scene picked up around 10-12
After that it died down and everyone seemed to head downstairs to the lounge
Even though we had just sat and ate we had to go and wait outside to get into the lounge downstairs
If your just going for dinner and a drink its a nice spot and the food was pretty good
Definitely order the Zeppoles for desert
Frequent customers in the meatpacking district, however this was our first visit to Vento/LevelV
Dinner first, then head downstairs for drinks at LevelV
The food was just okay, picked at our meals and agreed -- not a place to return to for food
Would have considered returning for drinks -- ambiance was pleasant
The manager told us the entrance to LevelV was outside, leave Coats inside - restaurant and lounge share coat room
What is that!? Headed outside in the cold, without jackets and couldn't get in! We are a couple (late 30's)-- a VP of an international restaurant company an NYC business owner
Both dressed very well, polite and quite honestly, 2 polished individuals! What a joke
We found this to be a disgusting way to treat customers who just ate inside
Would not return with clients, friends or family -- many other more rounded, respectful restaurants nearby
Very disappointed after going there to celebrate my birthday
Nothing spetacular at all! Not even their drinks were good
if you must try, then go, but remember
you were warned!!!
I booked 11 people for a bachelorette dinner here
The place was beautiful
Good staff to make reservations, and we sat on time as promised
The waiter was extremely annoyed because we weren't big drinkers at the restaurant
Normally we would be, but we were clubbing afterwards and had our own liquor agenda
He even had the nerve to pawn on us a bottle of champange, which he stated was good for a toast and was the cheapest one they had - only 22
50
We werent drinking because we were poor, its because we already started and were going out afterwards
Idiot! 20% will be attached to your bill
like they deserve it!
I had friends in from out of town so thought this trendy place would impress them
Wrong! We had reservations at 10:30 and they didn't seat us until 11:15
Two of the firve dishes were lukewarm to cold and we sent one back
The waitstaff was obviously overworked and I think assumed we were tourists so didn't pay a bit of attention to us
It took us forever to get a menu! The manager wasn't even super helpful though he did take a lot off of our bill
The mushoom appetizer was BAD! There were no celebrities to be found and no one really to look at
They were tired of the pretentiousness after that and we headed to midtown
While the hostess claimed to have lost my reservation, we were there early enough to only have to wait about 10 minutes to seat our party of seven
The waiter was awesome! Very helpful w/the menu and w/advice about where to go out after dinner
The food was excellent and the wait didn't bother our party - gave us more time to visit and have a few drinks
I would go back again
I had no clue what to expect when I went there for dinner
I thought I was going to be paying for another expensive meal and leave feeling hungry and cheated
I was wrong
I was pleasantly surprised with its food
The pastas and appetizers were very good
I would definitely come back
after having read reviews, i wasn't expecting the world -- but still
I don't understand waiting for a table here
food is interesting, and they present it well, but they seem to enjoy making you suffer through a long wait
spend a little more on the food, spend a little less on the drinks, and go somewhere else

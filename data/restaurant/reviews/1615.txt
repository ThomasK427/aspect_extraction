Manager would not even ADD a chair for friend who came in late where obviously there was space on our table
RUDE manager just came and gave us OH WELL shXX face and walked away
He said, well you said only 2 people , so
he was such a JERK !!! I have never been to a restaurant who would reject business
not even a 5 STAR hotel or rest would ever do that, who does he think they are?? FOOD was bland and not even worth the wait on line !!
I heard of this place through a friend and boy was he right, this place is great for brunch
The decor is great too, it doesn't feel like you are in Manhattan, somewhere more like upstate NY
We had a table that was right in front of a fireplace, which was great because it was freezing that day
I got the butermilk pancakes with apples and cinnamon
oh man these were the best pancakes ever, also try the pumpkin pancakes
oh my mouth waters just thinking about these
This place is worth the wait and worth every penny
oh and its very reasonable and the service was friendly but don't expect them to be very attentive
AWFUL SERVICE! It was our first time here and we were seated w/no idea about the rule in seating incomplete parties
When our friend joined, the mngr didn't let her in, called her a liar and followed her inside
When she found us, he yelled at us and told us to leave
I was horrified and said it was our first time and if we knew we would've waited
We stayed and finished our food, anyway
In response, the mngr observed us closely from the corner of the room
We later learned that the waiter who initially sat us down was new and also unaware of this rule
The mngr knew this and didn't care that his customers were in the right and his snobby restaurant was in the wrong
It was such a bad experience, I honestly hope this restaurant goes out of business
Never go here! The manager was the rudest person I have ever come across and for living in NYC that says lot! The hostess made the mistake of seating us before our entire party was there and the manager yelled at us for it! What happened to the customer's always right notion? The manager told the waiters to send over our bill and clean it up several times
We were forced out of the establishment for a mistake we did not make! The waiter kept coming up and asking to take our plates while we were still eating and the manager stood and stared at us through half our meal! What service
or lack there of!
While the location is charming, the owner has let the brunch success go to his head
Customers MUST order one entre each if dining outdoors, they will not seat you unless your entire group is present (nor will they hold a table) and they make it clear that they want to turn tables
The food, congeniality, and service have all deteriorated overf the past few years and so the wait is not worth it
I have always wondered why this restaurant doesn't have a higher overall score in Zagat and doesn't get better reviews from it's customers
Its fantastic
Brunch is what Friend of a Farmer is known for, however dinner is equally impressive
All of the omlets, pancakes, french toast, etc
are great as are the country standards (i
e
baked chicken) served in the evening
The Irving St
location automatically gives the customer the feeling of being in a quieter city, such as Boston, creating a much more relaxed environment
Lines are almost always long for brunch, but in the end, its well worth the wait
Other reviewers are right about the distracted service, but the food was so inventive and tasty, who cares that you have to chase them down for everything? Just get into the habit of doing that and relax with it, okay? The ambience, as mentioned by others, has that rural, 'Vermont' character about it, but frankly I didn't even notice that until I read it here
Somebody took me there, the restaurant was nice (except for actually playing 106
5 Lite FM, commercials and all!) but (here's the interesting part) the food was absolutely great
The iced tea mixed with lemonade
the salad with the blackened chicken, raw onion, and wasabi tartar
the quesadilla
the cherry pie
the molten chocolate thing: All terrific
And everyone was nice, even if they were hard to catch up with sometimes
I do enjoy coming here for the fresh lemondade, orange juice and ambiance
The food is average at best, its the location and the ambiance that makes it worth it
For some reason the last two times I've been my food has been cold and my drink without ice!
If I were to open a Vermont-style BB in NYC, this is it! Wood-beamed ceilings, cozy fireplace, and a quiet wood-themed setting makes you feel like you're somewhere in rural New England, having just stepped off the ski-slopes
Yummy comfort food offerings at a very moderate price makes this lovely restaurant the perfect escape from NYC bustle for brunch
If the queue is long enough, then it must be good
Having seen the line at FOAF on many occasions, I decided to give it a go - in fact several goes
Sure the decor/atmosphere is good, but I just cannot get over the fact that their food is diabolical
Eggs Benedict is not difficult to cook - but their version is just mindnumbingly bland
The hostess is so obnoxious, its worth a visit just to laugh at her
So why all the people? - maybe they got the wrong addres and should instead be next door
a friend recommended Friend of a Farmer to me and she has visited multiple times, so I had very high expectations
The cornbread that started the meal was delicious, which we followed with the mozzarella and tomato salad
My friend had the chicken with pasta and sundried tomatoes
I had the Terry Alan Chicken
My dinner was good
Her's was mediocre, and what was more unsatisfying was the price tag
While I knew before I went what the prices were like, I would have expected higher quality food for what the entrees were
It seems that in an effort to cook chicken completely which I appreciate, this restaurant achieved safely cooked, but dried out chicken
The waitstaff was very attentive and pleasant
We had no problems with the service
I may try brunch here sometime, but I will rush to other places before rushing here
Like another reviewer, I really want to like this place
Went here with a friend one weekday evening, after the dinner rush but still within dinner hours, and got abysmal service
Apparently there was a large party in the dining room upstairs, but that's no excuse for forgetting about your other tables and leaving your customers to languish for over an hour between salad and entree! My meal, once it arrived, was mostly cold and had clearly been under the heat lamps
Will give it another try, eventually
maybe
I went there for Easter Dinner and the pork chops were quite tasty
The ambience is nice too
While our waiter ran away for long periods of time, overall the experience was good
this is the place if you want to feel like your dining at an Inn upstate
my family had our thanksgiving dinner here this year instead of home (because having it at home would have been too painful due to a then recent loss) and i couldnt have been happier with the meal
ive eaten here a couple times and its always been good
Jaw-dropping incivility, I was speechless
We had a friend drop in to join a four person group at Sunday brunch
Because there's a line on Sundays, she told the manager she was just saying hi, she wasn't cutting in line by ordering anything
She asked for only a glass of water, and the waitress refused, to her face, twice
Ten minutes later the manager relented and dropped off a glass of water with an upturned nose
Against my better judgment, we left a tip
I'm still astonished
I thought diva-like tantrums were confined to Hollywood, this was just insulting
Not going back
warm cozy on a cold winter day! A country home setting
made me feel inviting and comfortable
friendly staff
Quiet spot away from the noise and crowds
A nice romantic spot for couples
Comfort food at it's best!!! Excellent food and a great atmosphere - just try to avoid sitting right by the stairs and kitchen - very busy
Friend of a Farmer makes you feel like you stepped out of Manhattan into New Hampshire! Great place and the servers are very attentive
After being seated promptly we were served complimentary fresh-baked cornbread with apple cinnamon topping, delicious
The tuna steak is outstanding, the pasta with shrimp in red sauce was decent and the salmon was also superb
The apple brown betty was to-die-for
A pitcher of sangria and we had an EXCELLENT dinner

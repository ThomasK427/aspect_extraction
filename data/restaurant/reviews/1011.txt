I tend to go to the two lounge-style bars upstairs because they are open-air, spacious, and always full of people
One bar of the two bars is a little more enclosed
You can walk from the right bar to the left bar and gaze at people munching and talking under the umbrellas in the at the open-air restaurant space on the lower level
However, no Corona or Becks
you will have to settle for a Sol
The two lower level bars have booths for large groups
The wine list is limited but good; I recommend the Nebbiolo
Pizza is also good
(I did see a lamb dish that was passing by that smelled and looked fantastic
) Overall the architecture of the space makes it unique, reminds me of the hot evenings in Miami
It's good for a laid-back first date or for a gathering of friends interesting enough to converse
I really love La Bottega
I try to go at least a few times each month
I highly recommend the nightly fish specials
They are always very creative and lovely on the taste buds
My other favorite is the Chicken Under a Brick
Yes, the staff is very pretty to look at, but to say they are the worst watiers in Manhattan is just a lie
I've noticed marked improvement in the service over the past few months
I'd rather have great food, amazing atmosphere and OK service than the reverse
It ain't the Four Seasons restaurant folks
and why would anyone want it to be!
I went with three friends on a slow (Monday) night, which may have accounted for the excellent service we received
Never an empty glass or stomach, and plates were cleared quickly
The appetizers were decent, nothing special, but all three entrees we ordered, plus a pizza to share, were incredible! I had the main chicken dish, cooked under a brick, and its crispy skin and amazing succulent deliciousness made me get all emotional
Prawns, as well as the bolognese pasta sauce were also remarkable
The wine list is ample
The ambience is nice, but the service rather shoddy
Everyone seemed confused
I had to ask for my wine three times, and I noticed several tables around had not been bussed for over 30 minutes
Good for brunch, though - less packed and more relaxed
Nice menu - solid basic Italian food - but nothing to call home about
I have been here many times for drinks
It is a great Chelsea oasis, where there's plenty of room to sit outdoors, have pricey drinks and smoke, if you choose
Staffed and populated by America's Most Beautiful Model rejects, along with their usually older companions, it is also a place to sight an occasional celeb or two
The food menu is extensive, but almost seems like an afterthought with hit-or-miss dishes and uneducated servers
Ingredients here seem top-notch: perfect olive oil, olives, fresh greens, fish and meats, etc
And for the most part, what comes from the kitchen is delicious
But there're also disasters, like the beefaroni taste-a-like bolognese
I say, stick with the salads, small plates and the great pizzas, enjoy your drinks, but for go elsewhere for perfect Italian food
As beautiful as the Maritime Hotel is, La Bottega sucks
I went for lunch: the food is mediocre and the cocktails are disgusting-- but it's the rude service that is the most unacceptable and unforgettable
The restaurant is overstaffed but the waiters are not interested in serving
Getting someone to come over to take your order, clear your plates, provide silverware: the basics, is very difficult
I will not return
After being seated by a wannabe model, we were left abandoned at our table with nothing but menus and empty glasses
We couldn't even get a bus boy to bring us water even though I counted about 10 of them rearranging utensils on empty tables because they had no direction
It took about 15 minutes before we finally got fed up and left
We ended up going to a wonderful Italian restaurant in the East Village which cost us about 1/2 what we would have paid at La Bottega
If you go to La Bottega, you will most likely sacrifice good service for ambience
When will the owners learn that it's better to have a restaurant with GOOD and CONSISTENT service and food, rather than a hip crowd and cute waitstaff
I have been here more than 10 times, because I like the ambience - but I will never go here for the service
There were tables waiting 30 mins to be bussed, and none of the tables were well maintained
When it becomes slow and no longer the it place, don't expect to see many people trying to get in the door for the sub par service and good, but un-original italian fare
PS they need new menu items - they're getting old!
La Bottega is probably the best example of what is happening in this part of town
Huge restaurant where eating is not recommended
Go there for a cigarette and a drink or two but stay away from the less than average italian muddle
If you're hungry, stay away!!!!
enjoyed la bottega immensely
seated promptly; while waitstaff seemed confused as to what they should be doing (one actually looked at my partner's mojito and asked if she had 'put her dinner in the glass'), our waiter appeared experienced
food was great: arugala salad was absolutely delicious; the veal was tender and breaded appropriately; the desert of cheesecake was perfectly creamy and sweet
waiter made good selection with house wine, though the cocktails could use help (apple martini lacked any apple flavor and a mojito simply wasn't the best)
but when the $180 bill came for two people, i was more than happy to pay
great time, trendy but relaxed scene, especially in the summer
CAUTION: Do not cut across the dining room to go to the restrooms
You run the risk of having 3 aging funksters tackle you
You must go downstairs and outside the building to come back inside
RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!!! Feels more like a club than a restaurant
The service is horrendous
The staff is inexperi3nced and they wander around not knowing what to do The food was actually good, but I was so aggravated by the time it came I could barely enjoy it
I've been four times and the experience has been different each time
Both the food and wine menus are well varied by price allowing you to upscale/downscale your experience accordingly
The hostesses (all) are very comely, especially the one in the Pocahontas bootsand the crowd runs the gamut including schoolgirls (in uniform no less), ex-pat Italians and aging pds in search of their next score
Standouts include Barbaresco (by the glass), grilled sardines, savory lamb shank and an orechiette with enough garlic to ward off you most ardent admirers
However, avoid the pasta at all costs as this is one Italian restaurant that needs to learn the meaning of al dente
Bottega has such a great ambience, that the menu is a disappointment
The food is far from BAD, but every item on the menu is missing the key ingredient that would link the other potentially evocative ingredients together
The waitress was extremely pleasant and eager to help, especially considering how busy the restaurant was at the time
Management or one of the many busboys should have been monitoring the tables more closely to ensure consistency - we had to ask for olive oil for the flatbread, when it was on nearly every other table as well as salt and pepper
I hoped the salt and pepper might also arrive, but my hopes were lost
When we put our name in, we were told the wait would be 45 minutes
45 minutes later, when we asked the status, we were told they had no idea when they could seat us
45 minutes after that (1
5 hours after we put our name in), they still hadn't served us
After giving us attitude, we were finally seated
Once seated, however, the wait was not over
There was no waiter to be seen
Finally, we noticed two of the waiters fighting over who had to take our table
On a positive note, the food was excellent
If the restaurant can work out the service-related kinks, it should do well, but I will probably follow the 6-months rule and wait until they have been open for 6 months before returning
We are so excited by the new restaurants opening up in the area
First Bivio, now La Bottega (or the other way around)
La Bottega has the look and feel of Pastis, but it has much more of a casual, laid back feeling
The wait staff is terrific as is the food
Crowd is good, although we are afraid that may change as word of mouth spreads and the weather get warmer (outside garden)
Oh well
it's nice to have a few new good restaurants to choose from
I have eaten here a few times now and the food is consitently good
all of it! Drinks are great too

worth it
Great atmosphere, fabulous music, and the waiter was very knowledgeable and a great salesman
The food, however, was a HUGE disappointment
Of the 7 dishes we tried, we would only order 1 again
The fluke ceviche was so sour that we couldn't finish it, and the rice in the sushi rolls was very gluey
I went to Sushi Samba with my girlfriends on Thursday night
We had a great time
The vibe was cool, the food was great and the drinks were flowing
This is where you go when u're craving a little of the exotic
The sushi is as good as any from the Japanese communities in Brasil, and the music is always hot
U cannot go wrong with any of the cocktails, and if you're unsure about what to order, its safe to just trust your waitperson
Watch carefully for lounge seats to open, these are prime people watching b-seen spots to have a meal!
Doorman needs a reality check
People who have dinner reservations should not need to show ID at the door
However, I suppose many door-people across the city have power control issues
Sushi Samba 7 has a fun look and atmosphere
If you like a place with funky music (brazillian influenced) and a noisy crowd, this is the spot
It appeals to medium to large parties and couples looking for a fun date
Food is good, but nothing to rave about
There are some unique items on the menu which make choices interesting
Try some basic rolls and also some of the more unique rolls
The major downside is the poor planning
It seems as though they take too many reservations
Also, the waiters are disinterested in the patrons -- Makes for bad service
Definite plus in the summer with the roofdeck and outdoor seating in the front of the space
Not a place to go for a romantic dinner, unless you may be sitting outside
We ended up sitting inside on a group table which was pretty tight and we had people we didnt know on both sides of us
Food is expensive but tasty
Definitely not filling
Service wasn't very accurate, very friendly but got one roll wrong (when we only ordered 2 on that course) and one drink wrong
Overall it was fun to go to and nice to see somplace different, but not sure if I will be back soon
The atmosphere is very sexy and very inviting
The colors get your senses going
But, whatever you do, do not order a roll
It is about $15+ for a roll that hardly fills you up
Instead, get some apps and a main course
The calamari is very spicy! And very yum
Was a bit hesitant to get the basic chicken teriyaki-but it was SAMBA style and very delicious
The music was nice and overall a good experience
Stay away from the rolls!
As soon as I walked in, I hated the place
First off, someone else in my group had picked the restaurant beforehand and made reserves
I should have known what the place would be like as soon as I realized its location
That part of the West Village isn't known for nice restaurants, esp
if it's right on 7th Ave
Anyway, while the decor appeared nice, the only thing I noticed was the freneticism and the noise level
Not the kind of atmostphere I go to when I want to have a nice dinner
That said, we got three different sushi appetizers only
smoked duck with mango I think, someone else got lobster and another got
er, I can't recall
The point is though, each and ever appetizer was EXCELLENT, and the melange of flavors was a real delight
I'd only go back to this place for takeout
SushiSamba was once a sexy space to eat innovative fusion cuisine
While I've always thought that the food was never as good as Asia de Cuba's attempt at Asian-Latin fusion, I must say that last night's outing could prompt me to think that their sushi isn't as good as Terikayi Boy's
This is an exaggeration, yes, but the prices are ridiculous for so-so sushi
The main courses are pretty good, and so were the appetizers, but nothing special
The main attraction is the beautiful space (rooftop garden) and the delicious drinks
It is certainly not the beautiful people-wannabes: the Carrie Bradshaw devotees with therma-straightened hair, $150 Louis Vuittons and Barneys warehouse sale Manolos, posturing for their Mr
Bigs, who came to the restaurant in the same untucked button downs, by way of the LIRR
Went there late on Saturday night
Our waiter spent more time telling us how tired he was than actualy waiting on us
I guess making us wait ten minutes they had a chance to warm up our beers
Food is adequate but not worth the price
While the food is decent, I'd venture to guess that people aren't coming here to have a gourmet experience
(You can do that at any number of restaurants in NYC
) I DID enjoy my lobster tempura roll and LOVED the chocolate coconut tore dessert
Service was alright; it was a busy night so our waiter was harried
The vibe at Sushi Samba 7 is sexy, cool, hip and fun--especially if you're with a group and you're eating up on the roof on a gorgeous summer night
That's the point
Definitely one of those fabulous places that are tailor made for a Sex in the City dining scene
Sushi costs like Nobu, buts tastes like Supermarket
Seafood entree was fishy and salty
Service was attentive and nice but could have been less pushy in offering sparkling water Cocktails (she seemed desperate to get more money out of the guests)
go to PARK not 7
7 was WAY OVERPRICED and the fried plantains were totally different than the ones served at PARK
drinks were expensive and the service was bad too
This place gets packed! So if you are into the scene and don't mind being jostled about, then, by all means go on a weekend
If not, wait for a slower time - like Tuesday at 5:30 PM
The South-American/Japanese ceviche dishes are delish - as are many of the custom made sushi dishes
The plaintains were good - but not authentic
The rolls are over-hyped and over-priced
I had the Samba roll which was basically a souped-up salmon avocado roll (other placed would be 4-6 dollars max
) and it was $9
50
The mojitos and caipihrinas (sp??) pack a punch and taste innocent
A great place - but, of course a scene, packed, and pricey
Very inventive dishes as well as drinks
I was seated in the rooftop dining area and the set up was really nice but it was just too crowded
Make reservations for dinner
Brunch menus are also very versatile and creative
I recently had the WORST experience here when I went with a large group-our waitor gave us serious attitude, got our entire order wrong and mixed-up, never apologized and then had the nerve to overcharge us for drinks and, believe or not, the food! We ordered the fixed price sushi sets for $20, they tried to charge us $30--maybe they thought that we were too pissed to check the bill after having to wait 2 hours for food and getting into an argument with management about the loused order!
I have been to both Sushi Sambas in Manhattan and the one on 7th ALWAYS does it for me
The best part of it all is the option to dine elegantly inside or out
The roof dinning is just Phenomenal
Especially since the NEW YORK summer has finally arrived
I can never get tired of this place
The roof top dinning was very nice, the service excellent, the food and drinks a little pricy but worth it!!!!!!!!
Dined at S S 7 last night for the second time
Had major problems with the service during my first outing
However, this time the whole expeiriance was amazing thanks in large part to my waiter Chris

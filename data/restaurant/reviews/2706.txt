Terrific burgers, a wide variety on the menu
Was wondering what took my clams casino so long, discovered they were made from scratch (not frozen) - delicious
Sports on TV, a dart board, neighborhood regulars
it's like Cobble Hill's version of Cheers
Ask for Tom or Annie
Good people! And the value speaks for itself
You'll feel like you had a homey, honest experience here
Oh yeah, and good jukebox!
Well, despite the mostly negative reviews of this place, I went ahead and got delivery from them
I ordered chicken vindaloo, the delivery took about an hour, and it cost me $13 with tip
The food was very hot, so I could tell that it didn't sit around after being cooked
Chicken vindaloo should be really spicy, with lots of chicken and potatoes in a thick sauce
The spiceness definitely met my standards, although there were almost no potatoes
There was, however, a lot of chicken
The sauce was thick and less greasy than most places, which is good, but more sugary, which is bad
The overall flavor was good
This place is local for me, and I will continue to order from them
at least until I find somewhere better
I just wrote a scathing review of Amin's neighbor, Kapadokyu, and it occurred to me that when something is great I never even think about reviewing it
So: This is a terrific little place with great atmosphere and the sweetest waiters
Highly recommended
Although the prices are kind of high for lunch the atmosphere is nice
It's not that crowded and the staff are very nice
I wouldn't go for dinner though cause it gets too crowded and the takeout at night is very slow
The food is not the greatest but if you don't want to travel to Curry Row in New York City, it will do
Three of us had dinner at Amin on December 27 and it was quite an enjoyable experience
We thought the food was delicious and reasonably-priced, our server was very attentive and sweet-mannered, we had a window table, and it was quiet
We'll definitely return!
I've been to Amin several times
It wouldn't rank high in terms of authenticity, but it seems to be fairly consistent, nothing really awful, and really, are there any excellent Indian contenders in brooklyn? Service is decent (good for Indian), and I was never rushed
This is a good place to ease newbies into westernized Indian
Before Curry Leaf opened around the corner, Amin was the only Indian rest
around and they became all too comfortable with that monopoly
The food lacked any real resemblence to Indian cuisine, the staff was down right nasty and it was a miserable experience overall
My boyfriend and I order in from Amin at least 3 times a month and we have never had any complaints
Delivery is always quick and friendly, even when it's pouring out, the prices are reasonable, and the food is always hot and wonderful
We are definitely fans!
Amin's main selling point is that it's the only Indian restaurant in the area
It's a rather important selling point when you have a craving for chicken tikka or curry
The food is nothing to write home about
The service is uneven
it really depends who you get
I'm no longer surprised when the waiters forget to bring me dishes/drinks that I've ordered
However, once in a blue moon, they throw in a little extra which is nice
In all cases, service is slow but it's not the waiters fault
the kitchen can't seem to handle more than a few orders at a time
The prices won't faze you if you're used to Manhattan prices
Overall, Amin can be infuriating at times but it's the only game in town
Yeah, it's maybe 10-15 percent too expenive, but the food is fine, and the atmosphere is a little more relaxed than on 6th st
Certainly less stuff hanging from the ceiling
Good for delivery if you live close
Great food, really nice fresh fish and fabulous service
Simply a delightful place to dine (whether on Sushi or some of their cooked entrees) in downtown Brooklyn
Ichiban is one of the best Sushi places
The fish is extremely fresh and always presented beautifully
It's never crowded and I am surprised by that
It really is very, very good
I don't understand why this restaurant is rated 9
0 and why the above people gave such generous reviews
The appetizer took 30 min and entree took 1 hour
They didn't even taste good
The view was great though
The park is right there by the water as well which can make your date finish somewhat romantically
The only bright side of my experience was the lovely lady sitting in front of me
Do not go unless you have lots of time and patience
Good thing was we didn't have any trouble getting a table
The rest of the experience was average
While it's true there's a great view of the Brooklyn Bridge and a short walk to the adjacent parks, the menu was average and the food was not memorable
Everything was acceptable, but not spectacular
Wouldn't make a good impression on a date--unless you date was from out of town
Nothing wrong with the service, either, but don't we all want something more from a dining experience than just average for above-average prices?
Frequently eat there
The staff is extremely attentive and friendly
The food is great
Pete's Garlic bread appetizer is delicious and the Stuffed artichoke (often a special of the day) is my favorite! Great for groups, family's or dinner for two
I highly recommend it you wont be disappointed
Great place to have a good Italian Meal (and a view of Brooklyn Bridge and NYC - from Brooklyn !  Best place for dinner before (or after) a concert at Barge Music - which is just accross the street
Great Kitchen and Staff will make anything you want to eat - make sure to take a walk to the waterfront after dinner and read the words of Walt Whitman engraved on the railings
Out of the numerous times I've been there, I have never had a meal where the food tasted like it has been there for a while
I strongly recommend the Fried Calamari and ANY entree
If you get a window seat, lovely view of Manhattan
I have ordered delivery and dined in at La Traviata many times for over 5 years
They provide decent Italian food and reasonably fast delivery to Brooklyn Heights
However I was denied service from them when I called today
Whomever fielded the call said that I failed to pay tax once
I have a vague memory of their having messed up one of my orders and my refusing to pay a few dollars I was overcharged a while ago
But my wife and I have ordered from there serveral times since with no problem
When I told them this I was still rudely refused service
I have been ordering less and less from them due to a decline in their quality
But now they have permanently lost a long time customer
I've been going here for many years and will continue to do so
Food is great, portions are great for the price and the general ambience is what makes this my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn
While the food isn't out of this world, it offers a decent meal at a decent price
They have a relatively extensive Italian menu and it's a great place if you're not afraid of carbs
I've been ordering from this place for awhile now and it's never been a disappointment
Highly recommended for good solid family-style Italian food
The pizza is one of the best take-out options in the neighborhood
I have been eating at this establishment since 1983 and the prices haven't changed
The food is still excellent and so is the service
In fact, the only thing that has changed has been the location

need I say more?
Not a bad slice, crispy crust with a decent sauce
It's just that there are much better slices to be had in the city
I don't see why this place gets such good reviews
I was disappointed
Also it is small, cramped and the pizza is overpriced
My absolute favorite, pizza is perfect
Courteous service Five Stars:-)
Mall pizza   Location brings in good crowds
Big crowds do not make good pizza
Best slice in the Village, but John's is better for whole pies
I went a few times and thought the pizza was only good to so-so, and coud not understand the hype; but I went other times and saw why other people thought of this as the best slice in the city
I think it's just that the pizza varies from visit to visit; perhaps it depends on who is manning the ovens
It looks now as though they have shut down one of their two restaurants that were a few doors apart from one another on Carmine St
Forget about the best slice this is the best pizza in NYC period
If you don't think so you should move back to Idaho for a nice potato slice
Pie only restaurants serve nice, yuppie brick oven concoctions with gourmet toppings
No problem with these but they can't qualify as best slice in my book
Best slice is the traditional with no toppings and Joe's is the best
Used to be NYC had a bunch of good ones but most are gone now leaving us with (fill in the blank) Ray's Pizzas dripping with fake cheese on a sponge
So crispy you might as well order three slices (I know you want it) and tasty too! The place is a dump but that's just keeping it real
Real cheese, real thin crust, real good sauce
If you don't agree, you're an idiot
Joe's moved from the corner to the middle of the block and now looks like every other pizzeria in New York
The management nonetheless put up a sign in the new space proclaiming the shop is as seen in spiderman
Oh, the irony
The pizza is the same - the best according to Bostonian Ben Affleck
There are so many reasons you can list for why you should eat at Joe's
Maybe it's for the totally authentic NY pizza
Or maybe the convenient location in the heart of the Village with equally convenient late hours
My reason you ask? Spider-Man personally delivers your pizza
Don't believe me? Go rent Spider-Man 2
The best pizza in NYC and the world
This is the Plato's form of what pizza should be
Excellent crust, tasty sauce and just the right amount of cheese
I always order a pie well done plain or with anchovies
Every time I'm home, I make sure I go to Joe's
I usually go around lunch time, when it can be crowded, but it's worth it
The fresh mozzarella pizza is easily my favorite slice, although the plain cheese slice is also great
The only downside is the lack of space/seating, but the quality of the pizza easily makes up for it
I recommend that everyone tries Joe's at least once, just go when I'm not there
Do you crave a good slice of pizza? Do you want something late night to help quell your impending hang over that is quick, easy and delicious?? Look no further than Joe's
I love pizza
I make it a point to try a slice at every pizza place I see, and I can honestly say hands down, Joe's is the best
Don't go expecting a nice, or even decent, place to sit down with your date and enjoy a pie
It's pretty crappy looking and and people are lined up like they are waiting for their unemployment check
However, DO NOT BE DETERRED
Go now and be prepared to be pleased
Joe's is simply NY traditional style pizza at it's best
No gimmicks like coal ovens or deep dishes to try and trick you
You are not forced to buy an entire pie to sample
You'll be thanking me later!!
Joe's has the best pizza by the slice in NYC
whenever I visit the Village I make sure I stop by Joe's
service is quick
and each slice is about $1
50 which is a good deal
they are located on Carmine St
right near Bleecker
check it out next time you are in Greenwich Village
It was on David Letterman's talk show
Rated as the best pizza ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I happened acrossed Joes Pizza the 1st time I ever ventured into the village alone as a teen
Joes blew me away
I was hooked from day one
I would pass a dozen other pizzerias in the snow to get to joes
The crust is thin but always crispy
The sauce and the cheese melt together to perfection
I moved to the DC area recently and still fantasize about Joes Pizza
there is truly no other pizza that comes close
If you don't mind standing at one of the table inside or in front of the best pizzeria in town, you are in store for the best slice of real New York pizza, perfected with a perfect thin crust, sweet tomato sauce and cheese, baked to perfection
go early in the morning 10:30-11 amish(when they open) for a fresh slice not at 3am for a 4x reheated piece,or better yet buy a pie of your own cause when its right, joes is by far the best pizza on the island of manhattan, but be warned it all depends on timing and frequency I have had some of my best slices here as well as some of my worst-burnt,reheated cardboard pieces -also make sure you go to the one on the corner not in the middle of the block
also stick with the basics no fresh mozz,or pepperoni-they're not bad just not extrodinary
The pizza at Joe's is okay, not good, not bad, just okay
I honestly don't know why people seem to like it so much
It's like saying Bill Clinton was as great a President as Abraham Lincoln
I went back twice to see what I had to be missing and I'm still wondering
Patsy's is much much better, albeit more expensive
The first time I went to Joe's, I thought, This is it? This may be the best pizza I've had in Manhattan
The cheese is excellent, and they're not skimpy on it
The sauce is excellent, not too sweet or salty, and definitely not plain
The crust is the best
I don't know how they do it; it looks the same as everywhere else, but the mild charring on the edges and underneath, with the flavor of the oven (this may be person-to-person), is exquisite
If you like basketball, there's nothing better than grabbing a slice and crossing the street to The Cage
This is New York
Just the best pizza ever
which is evident from the crowds that gather there throughout the day
Flavorful, served piping hot
and VERY CRISPY crust
not soggy and greasy like many places
Quick service
good prices
If you don't mind eating it while sitting on a bench, enjoying the atmosphere
It feels great to see that some of the best food comes from the most simplest of places
The pizza was great
The crust was thin and crispy, and the sauce + cheese were just perfect
We were visiting NY and ate Pizza here and absolutely loved it
The greatest part is that even tho the Pizza tastes delicious, you do not feel heavy or worn down after eating a few slices :)  Would totally recommend it to anyone visiting NY
i recently came across Joe's Pizza
eventhough there is no seating and its not big of a place

There is a microwave available, but who wants to go out to a restaurant where they have to microwave their own food?!
The food is really tasty especially the smash potatoes
They serve a lot in case you have a good apetite
I feel the need to respond to the negative reviews about Mama's
First of all, Mama's is not a soul food joint; just a place that serves rich, tasty, well-seasoned, home-style food
And the reason the food is cold is because you're supposed to heat it up yourself! Keep your eye out for the microwave
The decor is great and includes random portraits of Mama's of all shapes, sizes and colors and homey mismatached tables and chairs
So don't listen to those nasty reviews, give Mama's a try and see for yourself
I was excited to go to Mama's for the first time, and I did love the portions and liked the food, but I honestly would rather spend an extra couple bucks and have the food made to order (lukewarm fried chicken ends up tasting so/so) and be waited on
It's cheap, but not *that* cheap
It was during the summer, so my friend and I ate outside at the little school desk tables -- fun and kitschy, but a bit awkward
After reading the ratings from others, I decided to try this place and was really disappointed
Although the price was very reasonable, the pre-made food was hard as rock and it's mostly served cold
This might be a good place if you just want to grab some fast take-out that taste no better than MacDonalds
As a NYer with Southern roots, I was really unimpressed by what they had
The food's cold and kinda tasteless and the place is crawling with hipsters looking like they're refugees from the 80s
If want real soul food, go Uptown to Harlem or to Brooklyn or Queens
Like most other things in Manhattan today, it's the fake and watered down version of how stuff should be
do you love friend chicken? Do you love Mashed potatos, man and cheese
I can keep going on and on
Bring an empty stomach and a bottle of wine and you are set
My first Mama's experience was a week ago and I am in love
I was a bit confused about how to order and the cute boys behind the counter were intimidating, but I eventually got the fried chicken (so so good!) and some veggies--got a TON of food and a coke for just $11! Hearing the Stone Roses and Pulp during my meal was the icing on the cake
Probably not a place to go with a huge group of people although I went with 5 other people and we were lucky to score the big table
I will definitely go back and tell everyone I know about it
I just moved into the east village and love this place
for 10 bucks i get enough food to feed me and my girlfriend!  no airconditioning!
This is the place that'll show you why fast food is Satan
The food here is healthy, they give you GIANT portions, there's a terrific selection, the price is right, and above all the people are the nicest anywhere
I've heard the mashed potatoes and the macaroni and cheese are the best anywhere, but the vegetables are so good I've never gotten anything else
Three sides -- I usually get roasted brussel sprouts, snap peas in sesame dressing and some sort of orzo-feta salad -- are around $8
50, which is great considering you're not going to be hungry for another five hours
Every NY neighborhood should have a Mama's
Gotta warn you, though -- it's casual, funky and they play all sorts of weird music
But the place has serious heart
This place isn't really a restaurant
It's like fast food but less organized, you serve yourself and everything else
The food wasn't that good
The mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, brocolli were good but the chicken was dry and cold, no good
It took about a five minute walk to get there too and the place was not busy at all
Basically you get what you pay for
I wouldn't recommend this place, you're better off at popeyes or KFC
After multiple visits, I have to weigh the pros being great mac'n cheese---like no where else I've tried
The other sides are sometimes healthier, but just as tasty
It is a great deal, for around $10, you have a real big pile of food on your plate, and that includes a beverage
I don't even mind heating up my meal in the microwave nearby
The entree items, though, need some work
I have had better, crispier, juicier chicken; the meatloaf is too dry for them not to have gravy on the premises; and the salmon is also dry and tasteless
Still, don't let that turn you away
Again, the portion of your sides will more than make up for it
Better yet, simply order the sides combo platter
Brilliant solution!
There's no knocking Mama's
The food is truly one of the best bargains in the city
Full of flavor and remarkably consistent
True, it's always on the cold side, rendering the microwave crucial, but it's a testament to the food's quality that it still tastes good
This is the restaurant that acutally made me like brussel sprouts and beets
no small feat
Staff can be a little rude
This is by far the best pizza I have ever had
I've been coming to this Ray's since the mid 80s and I have not had a better slice of pizza in New York or any other city
Thick chewy crust, tons of cheese and tasty sauce
There is no better pizza in the world, this is the 1st place I come to when in NYC
We order from Two Boots on a regular basis and have eaten in the restaurant because of their unique pizza with a thin crust and Cajun sauce that can't be beat
Usually, delivery to 14th St
and Ave
B takes 45 minutes, but tonight was the worst
We waited one hour to call the restaurant at which point they said it'd arrive in a minute
Finally, after an hour and a half we received an ice cold pizza with no apologies from the restaurant
very unique pizzas, the only thing I didn't like is the cornmeal on the bottom of the crust but the flavors more than make up for it
try the one with pesto! there are so many good ones it's hard to pick one that was great
Get it fresh and it's a lot better than run-of-the-mill corner pizza stands
Cornmeal on the bottom of thin crust makes it crunchier without interfering with taste
Standard toppings or spicy New Orleans style
Really Good!
Expensive, overrated, and small slices for big cash
There are so many better pizza places in walking distance from any of the two boots locations
If anyone else tells me this is the best pizza in NYC, I'm gonna flip
(tastes OK, but just way overrated)
This place is soooooooo over rated
Why do they have corn meal (or whatever that is) on the crust? Real pizza places do not put pineaplle on any pizza
Give me a pizza place that makes good enough pizza that they dont need to use corny names to sell it
While it is not anywhere near the best pizza in the village, it is among the more expensive
This pizza is awful
seems like you cannot get a slice of pizza with just pepperoni or sausage, you must get a Mr
pink, or another gimmicky slice that has toppings that do not belong, like crawfish??!! Beyond that the crust is thin and soggy, and there is barely enough cheese to call it pizza
I felt totally ripped off that they pass themselves off as a pizza parlor
If you want to sell fru-fru pizza you should have to move to California or put it inside a restaurant
The service was awful too, as the counterperson asked me 3 times what I had ordered before producing my plain slice 15 minutes later
Sure there's John's, Original Ray's whatever; Two Boots delivers a fresh take on pizza
It takes all the best qualities and pushes it up to the next level
two boots is the beat, they have unique toppings like spicy shrimp and andouie sausage
a frequent every time we go to nyc
love it!! its quick and good
No doubt two boots has good pizza and other exelent food, but their pizza comes no where close to the top ten
Two Boots, one of the few interesting pizza shops in NYC my first visit was the beginning of a long term relationship with this place
The food is always fresh and interestingly tasty
I am a pretty good simulator of sauces but this is giving me a bit of a hart time
I think I will give up trying to figure out the ingredients and enjoy the food
I gave an A+ grade for Two Boots

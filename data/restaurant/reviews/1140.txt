Went there a few days ago with a friend
It was packed but we were still seated within 15 minutes
The food was absolutely wonderful
Best lamb I've ever had
Love the ambience and the wait staff was very attentive
Only con? That too many people will hear about it and make it impossible to get in
Loved the creative tapas; fried chickpeas, fava bean sprd, crostini w/chocolate sc and chorizo to name a few
Several items have portion options so you can try several (and at very reasonable prices)
Very good selection of Spanish wines/sherries by the glass and they allow or I should say encourage you to taste before ordering
Though tiny and always packed the place has a very warm atmosphere created primarily by the staff (esp the owner) who go the extra mile on service with their super friendly disposition, recommendations and generosity
I really like this place and can't wait to go back
I went there on Monday and had to wait 50min for seat for two
Waitstaff was friendly and sagria was good
Tapas were average
I went with the wifey last Friday and had a wonderful time
It's the usual small narrow dark NYC restaurant space (approx
10 tables) and the tapas are great
We were told ~35 min
wait, but sat/ate at the bar right away
Bar seats are usually more interesting anyway
We shared 5 tapas b/w us and had plenty of food (even a little left over)
The chorizo was very good and the potatoes aiola were incredible
We also had the stuffed peppers w/white tuna on top
Sangria was good and affordably priced by the pitcher
Waitstaff was attentive and helpful when we had questions
We'll definitely come back!
I just went here with a friend and had the most wonderful time! The waitstaff was incredibly attentive, the food was absolutely delicious (and arrived very quickly), and the sangria, delightful
The duck breast was the winning dish of the evening -- perfectly done and excellently paired with its sauce
By far the best tapas restaurant Ive been to in New York (and beats most of the ones Ive been to in Spain)
Save room for dessert
place is small so arrive early but you will love the food
Everything is tapas style and delicious
Alot of interesting items and worth it! Definately try the sangria
Best sangria I ever had in a long time
On CitySearch's recommendation, we put Tia Pol on our must experience list
We were extremely disappointed! Walking in it was if we had walked into a private party
The bartender/wait staff were unfriendly, uninterested in serving us and more preoccupied with letting us know when the kitchen was closing (we arrived at 11pm, kitchen closed at midnight)
They had one beer on tap, gave us no help with recommending wine or food and treated us like the annoying aunt who visits unannouced
We were looking forward to authentic Spanish tapas; having been to Spain many times and love food and culture
When we ordered a salad and a few tapas they threw them all at us at once
The salad was good, tapas just okay
The spot could be nice, we liked the simpleness and openness, but left asap
Unlike the unannounced aunt, we know when we aren't welcomed
In order to get tapas and a small table you will need to wait at least 40 min on a Saturday night, but rest assure that you will leave a very satisfied customer
Try not to over look this place as you pass it by---its a little hole in the wall but the result will leave you asking for more! The tapas are very tasty especially the Patatas Fritas, bread w/fava bean spread and the pork sandwich
To drink I recommed their white sangria w/strawberries and to finish the night a nice dessert of cake w/dulce de leche ice cream
Enjoy!
A great experience on many levels, the food the ambience and of course the wine wine
The sangria is delicous!! Everything I've eaten here has tasted absolutely delicous
I highly recommend Tia Pol for a night of tapas and wine with friends or a date
Check it out!
I made a reservation last week for 8 people for my best friend's birthday
Our whole party ended up being late but the hostess was gracious enough to hold the table for our party
We even ended up having 2 more girls in our party and they gave us extra stools to sit on
The food was fabulous, the service was great, and overall we had a wonderful time
The place is super crowded and pretty small but it feels more intimate than cramped
The prices are awesome too! I am definitely coming back
Tia Pol is amazing
it's charm oozes through its people and food
I went with three of my friends on Saturday night, waiting 30 mintures for a table, but chowed on some incredible tapas and sangria as we waited
There was a pretty hostess that kept checking up on us and made us feel welcome
We met one of the owners and she was just as charming
It was an warm and welcoming place to bring guests because the staff is accomodating and does not have the typical snobbish attitude a place with such quality food and buzz usually has
Again, it's small, and so there is always a wait, but it's well worth it
Be sure to get a pitcher of sangria and paquetitos de jamon, awesome
The first two times I went to Tia Pol, I left when they told me it would be a 45 minute wait (and this was midweek-they dont' take reservations)
The third time I decided to wait, and I'm very glad I did
The wine list/cocktails here are great, and the tapas menu (all in Spanish) is incredible
I spent three weeks in Spain last year and this really brought me bac there
The waitress was really helpful and helped us choose 4/5 tapas, which were all amazing
We had sangria and cocktails and had a great time
The place is tiny, but that's part of its charm, and when it's warm out, it's worth grabbing a cool drink and waiting outside for a table
You won't regret it
The food is wonderful and the staff is extremely warm
It is a great place to eat with 1-3 friends as the space is small and cozy
The tiny bar is also a great place for wine a few tapas
A lovely, tiny place with friendly staff
The mussel and white bean stew special was so scrumptious we ordered another one
Nice cheese plate with candied squash garnish
I can't recommend the intriguing red wine sorbet in a glass of coca cola dessert -it was like a slurpee with a hint of cinnamon
Otherwise, excellent
went with 3 others to this little tapas place and had to wait awhile, but we started ordering at the bar area then the staff kindly moved us over to a table when it was free
the bartender recommended a great wine, and 3 bottles later, we were glowing with happiness
the food is aboslutely delicious
best remembered favorites are the tuna and the white asparagus with caviar
cant wait to go again
I met two old friends whom I lived in Madrid with at Tia Pol and it was the perfect spot
We shared pitchers of Sangria, which was excellent and completely met my standards
The tapas were tastier than I've had in Spain
I highly recommend this spot to those who enjoy tapas, sangria, and wine! Oh, and the atmosphere was very cozy and friendly
The tapas was truly delicious, especially the foie gras special that we ordered
Not sure about the wine but the sangria we ordered is only so-so
It wasn't flavorable and the wine was a bit watery
The staff wasn't friendly and the service was disappointing
It was a very cold nite and they have the window at the back opened because of poor ventilation in the kitchen
The waiter refused to close the window eventhough the customers was freezing
After numerous complaints from different tables, the waiter finally gave in
But then the restaurant starting to get smoky
so you decide
I have been to Tia Pol numerous times now and it has been consistently excellent

The service is either good or great, depening on who is serving you
The food is excellent, and if you're in the mood for an affordable lunch, you cannot go wrong with the entrees on the lunch menu, almost all of them available for less than $10
The lunch menu, while a bit limited in offerings, still provides plenty of variety, but the dinner menu offers a much better array of choices
The atmosphere is not the best in the city, but it is still nice, and you will have no trouble enjoying the great food that you are served here
I have been going to Pellegrino's for well over a decade
I don't even ask for a menu or a wine list
Instead, I just have them pick the special of the day and choose a wine to compliment
Dessert cart is one of a kind
Service is second to none
Can't fault the food or the service but watch out for the price of the specials and the coffees
I took my out of town parents to Little Italy for Lunch
We asked the price of the fish special of the day, around $8was the reply
Then when the bill came it was $13
The coffees which are not priced on the menu were $5
50 - and it wasn't anything special
So the coffee cost almost as much as a bowl of pasta for lunch
Plus they had the nerve to add a 20% gratutity when there was only three of us - thankfully they removed that when I complained about the price of the fish and the coffee
All and all they were pretty stupid to treat us like that - everything was great, but there quibbling will mean I'll choose a different location in Little Italy next time
I have been to quite a few of the restaurants in Little Italy, but none left me wanting to come back as much as Pellegrino's
The service was excellent from start to finish (and this was during the hectic San Gennaro Feast), the Pollo di Parma was fresh and tasty, with gravy that was second to none
The wine list was exquisite, the chocolate mousse was heavenly
I highly recommmend this little slice of Italia in downtown Manhattan
Had a pleasant brunch post 4th of July
The fetuccini giovanni was quite tasty and the bread served was a pleasant tomatato pasted appetizer
Not bad for an 9 dollar meal and being able to eat outside was nice
Service was efficient, no excess pleasantries but certainly not rude
This is the type of place where you go there once and you keep going back
The service is outstanding and the food is terrific
Must see during Christmas
I enjoyed the penne ala vodka and caesar side salad, both were delicious and packed with flavor
The service was excellent and i was seated promptly during the lunch hour
Fabulous food! We first went there in the summer and ate outside which was wonderful
I get the Shrimp Oregenata each time I go
just fantastic!
This is Italian fare at its most mediocre
The veal marsala was nothing special though the basil was a nice touch, however, the marinara was in desperate need of some
The portions were fairly large but you will pay a high price
The staff were not very freindly but the service was fast so luckily, you're not in bad company for long
The atmosphere is the best thing about it
There are plenty of better Italian restaurants on Mulberry St to choose from, but if they're all booked, why not
Pellegrino's deserves every bit of the ratings it receives
My family dined there on Sun
, Sept 1
and to a person everyone agreed it was the best meal we ever ate in Little Italy
The food was delicious, the portions large, and the price was reasonable
We will most definatly dine there again
I ordered the pasta with seafood (can't remember the name os it) and it was heaven
The shrimp and calamari were cooked to perfection
I haven't had a meal where I was truly satisfied in a long time, until I came here! Def
on the pricey side, but worth it
The service was great too
Just had lunch at Pellegrinos
It was wonderful
Very delicious and at $6
50 for a wonderful lasanga it was a great bargain
The atmosphere and service was wonderful
This restaurant's cuisine represents Northern Italy
I've dined with authentic Italians at this place and they give it a thumbs up
The Maitre D's and waiters are friendly and willing to explain what the dishes are
The best part is the dessert tray that's displayed for diners to see
I enjoy the warm decor and ambiance and would recommend it highly especially if you want Italian food that's not tomato-based in most of the selections
The Scene Exposed-brick walls, wooden ceiling beams, comfortably spaced tables and subdued lighting render this a romantic dinner spot, but the pleasantly chattering atmosphere makes you feel like you've landed in the cozy dining room of a friendly Italian family
The crowd is a mix of financial types from nearby Wall Street and special-occasioners gussied up for a night on the town
Service is friendly, if somewhat inattentive
The Food On Ponte's upscale Italian menu, the two-pound signature lobster arrives "angry," swimming in spicy garlic butter
Meatier dishes include pork scaloppini with potato-apple gratin in a rich port-wine sauce and creamy rigatoni with sweet Italian sausage that subtly echoes the sugary tones of plump peas
The poached pear tart with almond gelato is nothing short of exquisite, with a light dusting of cinnamon over a crumbly almond-marzipan filling in flaky pastry
I have dined at F
Illi Ponte's a few times
I keep going back because I LOVE IT!  Free Parking at their own lot
-Valet  Service: I've never had better service and nicer waiters in my life
Decor: Rustic Italian Romantic, wood beams
Reserve a table by the window, you wont regret it
The view is of the hudson and jersey
On our most recent visit my boyfriend claimed he had the best lambchops in his life that night
I had the ravioli special of the day
It was perfect
They bring you bread, eggplant, and freshly grated cheese before you order
The owner comes around and always says hello
nice touch
Try the italian cheescake
All the desserts are homemade
Perfect to host a party, romantic date, or family function
Angry Lobster, Angry Lobster, Angry Lobster!! When you get there, you'll know what I mean
we took advantage of the nyc restaurant week special menu to check out this restaurant
this is a great place to enjoy a wonderful meal
there was not much of a choice from the special menu, but you couldn't go wrong
and when our waiter started telling us about the specials for the day, our mouths were watering
i haven't had such an authentic meal since dining at Da Guido in Siena, Italy! we'll be back again for sure, restaurant week or not! and try the carpaccio, yum yummm
The money they spend on marketing is what gets them customers, not the chef
There are at least 1200 nyc restaurants that have tastier food
You can do much better
As a gourmet cook, I naturally appreciate good food, so when I dine out, it is usually at a top, restaurant with a longstanding reputation of having fine cuisine
When a friend of mine had made a reservation at F
Illi Ponte, I was a bit skeptical since I had never heard of it
What a pleasant surprise when I arrived there
The restaurant was spacious and comfortable and reminded me of the restaurants of Tuscany and Umbria
Not only was the food extremely well prepared, but the service friendly and attentive
My friends all agreed that it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience
Four stars for the Angry Lobster and the special ostrich

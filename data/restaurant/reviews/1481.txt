They have everything from filet mignon, to sirloin, roastbeef, skirt steak, lamb, chicken, + more
Also a buffet of appetizers, which isn't big, but then again you're there for the meat
Their brazilian sangria is great
The decor is nice
Music was a mix
at some points it was good, and then others just bla
The rest turns into a lounge after 11 pm
which I believe has a lot of potential, but being that it still hasn't drawn in big crowds, there wasn't much going on
Theres also a belly dancing show (mini version's of Le souk's across the street)
When I first heard about Dirty Bird To Go I thought organic free range chicken
done by a top chef from Louisiana
How can it go wrong? At the very least, if she's from the South she should know from fried chicken! So off I went to read the reviews
dreadful
The chicken was unseasoned, the batter was too thick, the batter was too sweet, the mac and cheese was under salted the staff absolutely could not get the orders correct and almost worst of all none of the promised pepper vinegar
I then realized that most of the reviewers probably went within the first weeks when they were still getting the kinks out
I went yesterday July 4th following a recommendation by AM New York
So I, along with my intrepid friend went to try it
We were lucky to find the place empty at that moment  THE FOOD Was delicious
And perfectly done
ALL OF IT
The chicken was delicately seasoned, letting the natural flavor of the chicken shine through
It was succulent and salted through to the bone (which I had to keep myself from knowing)
This was also true of the breast pieces which can end up dry in less expert hands
The buttermilk batter was not too thick and was also well seasoned
Some of it fell off in little chunks so you could save it for crunching later
Oh but said buttermilk batter positively sang when paired with a few sprinkles of the pepper vinegar! Apparently the vinegar thing doesnt only work at the British fish and chip places
Who knew? The garlic kale was very good as was the dirty rice
The dirty rice was not aggressively flavored but it was not bland either
It went very well with the chicken
I also had the corn bread which was great on its own but it also turned out to be delicious dipped in their honey mustard sauce
To wash all this down I got two MORE pieces of that awesome chicken and a thirst quenching Dirty Palmer  So I said all that to say quit reading
get to Dirty Bird!!! p
s they had great customer service
I've developed a little bit of a dirty bird addiction
My faves are the fried chicken fingers - tender, juicy, salty, cripsy delicious chicken tenders, served with a tangy sweet dipping sauce and an even yummier pepper vinegar that it so good that I've been saving my leftover vinegar to put on EVERYTHING
The only downside is that the tenders are huge and a serving of five is too much food for me alone
I also recommend Ali's Chopped Salad, a cripsy delicious salad that is pushed over the line from good to sublime by the addition of some kind of spicy red pepper chopped over the top, along with Maytag blue cheese
And the whole thing is topped off with a surprisingly tart buttermilk dressing
So good
I have eaten in-store, which is fun and often busy, and I have ordered for delivery
Was impressed by how fresh the delivery was - food still hot, chicken still crispy, greens still crisp
I am so glad to be able to get food this good delivered quickly
This is some of the best chicken I've ever tasted
The batter is amazing and the chicken is so fresh and juicy
I've been there 4 times -- each time is better than the last
They've added some sides and I think they've got it going now
And the delivery is fast
Sure beats cooking!!
This place is really a joke
$7
50 for 1-1/2 pieces of chicken (the dried out-wing doesn't count as a whole piece) and NOTHING ELSE is ridiculous
If it were good, that'd be one thing, but it was greasy and flavorless
Not to mention that the breast wasn't cooked all the way, yet almost burnt on the outside
Learn how to cook chicken (as well as clean it-I shouldn't see lumps of fat under the breading) before calling good fried chicken
Popeyes may be a national chain, but they at least give you great chicken with a good biscuit and a side for less than $7
That's where I'll be heading next time I'm on 14th St
went for dinner the night - the fried chicken was excellent, probably the best in manhattan, the roasted potatoes were amazing, kids loved the chicken fingers, place looks great, will try the rotisserie chicken next time - looked great
Went there for dinner the other night, the fried chicken was excellent - fresh, juicy and the batter was delicious, the roasted potatoes were the best I have had - takeout or restaurant, the kids loved the chicken fingers, can't wait to try the rest of the menu which will be very soon!
i ate at dirty bird last week with my girlfriend and we both loved it
its tough to get quality chicked these days and we both thought is was excellent especially knowing the birds are healthy and farm raised and not some nasty chicken that was fed growth hormones jojos potatos and the corn bread were excellent as well as the lemonade and root beer seriously
we ordered lunch from dirty bird today
only took 20 minutes for delivery! the fried chicken was still hot and crispy
the meat is so juicy
we loved the pepper vinegar they serve with it
veggies were yummy, especially the cole slaw
wish they still had the mac-n-cheese though :-(
I've been to Dirty Bird five times now and there's been some valleys, but mostly peaks
The rotissarie chicken was good every time - I had one bummer meal when the fried chicken was overcooked
The kale has been GREAT everytime and the dirty rice not bad
Worth the price when it's good
I've been waiting for a place that serves organic and local foods which are actually tasty! Dirty Bird does it all, the fried chicken is AMAZING, probably the best I've ever had and the sides are great
You can't beat the price for the quality
A HUGE disappointment! We waited 45 minutes for our order in which they forgot to include our drinks and our sides---apparently, they ran out and failed to let us know that we would not be receiving both sides
The chicken was juicy, but I guess it would be if not cooked all the way through---bloody at the bone! And, yes, flavorless---super overpriced!
I paid eleven bucks for essentially four large hunks of hard fried batter with scrawny chicken parts embedded deep within them -- and no side orders
No way I'm going to make that mistake again
Fried chicken should be fleshy with a light crust, and this was the total opposite of that
This is the coolest tea place on earth
I'm hooked- they have a live DJ, good teas, and are cooler than any other food store I've ever been to
Plus great southern-style sweet tea, which was nice (and a rare find)
Always seems they have cool new ideas- its probably the next big thing
these guys are everywhere! i just found their products at the gansevoort hotel last weekend and came to check out their store in union sq this morning
their teas are truely unique and the ambience is unlike any other tea store
i highly recommend tea lovers NON tea lovers to visit them
their GREEN TEA BUBBLE TEA is hands down the best ever!
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! i love tea so this trendy spot is perfect
Its the next big thing so move over starbucks!!!!! try the chai or genius
Wow
They make tea fun
DJ on Upstairs floor and really delicious tea blends
They aren't afraid to let you sample so definetly try them all!
Went with a girlfriend of mine visiting from LA
I live in the area and thought I'd try out the very busy crowded spot (but not in a bad way!)
We had to wait awhile after being seated, but when the manager noticed us waiting so long- she personally helped out right away and was excellent
We shared a small side of penne with marinara sauce and a very thin, crispy margherita pizza
Both were delicious- truly italian- and definitely light
We each had a glass of Mammamia's house white, which was absolutely perfect w/ the meal or without
Seated in a dimly-lit, pillow-filled, cozy corner- we were very comfortable
A fantastic seating place if you're on a date!
I took my girlfriend to Oh Mammamia on Saturday night for a pre-movie dinner

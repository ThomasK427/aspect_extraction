Service is very friendly and organized
Not too many places to eat in (a few stools and small tables) so I had mine to go
Got a cheesteak with the onions and wiz
Tastes great and the preparation is authentic also (Steak is chopped)
Meat is tender and tasty
Very good value also as the sandwich is pretty good size and they do not skimp on the meat! I am so happy that NYC finally has some good cheesesteaks to sink their teeth into!
Honestly, it's as close as you're going to get to a decent cheesesteak in this town
Had a very enjoyable experience at Carl's
Taste like Philadelphia to me!!! Quick service and super tastey food
I like the Cheez Whiz w/ onions
The full sandwiches are kinda big so I would recommend splitting one if you go with someone
You can always order another one
Seating is limited so be aware
And there is no bathroom but they do provide plenty of moist towelettes
This one goes out to Carl
Upon entering the establishment today for lunch, I accepted the 20 minute wait I was warned of
However, after 30 minutes of waiting and then observing people who arrived after I did happily eating hot cheesesteaks is unacceptable
I kindly asked one of the workers behind the counter if my order was coming up soon
As I suspected, my simple order had somehow been pushed to the end of the line and not yet started
After 45 minutes of waiting, the least Carl's could do is not take your money before giving you your food so you have the option of walking out in anger with nothing lost but 45 minutes of your life
Finally in NYC there is a restaurant that serves the true Philly cheesesteak
Not only are the cheesesteaks fantastic, but the service is quick and friendly
As a wise friend said as we left, the smell was so good that I could eat another one
NYC finally has a solid cheesesteak (BB is good but not the real thing)
Carl's does its best to crank them out in the traditional Philly style, with soft rolls, cheese whiz and onions
Having grown up in Philly and averaged eating 1 cheesesteak per week for 15 years, I was hesitant to try an NYC version
Carl's was surprisingly good however and I recommend it to anyone looking for a decent cheesesteak
The meat could be a little less oily as it drenched the roll, but the roll was nice and soft as it should be
I give it an 8
5 out of 10 with potential
The Scene A mix of wallet-watching students, first dates and wine lovers share this casual, candlelit corner overlooking an active West Village intersection
Tiled floors, exposed brick, wooden tables and copper accents give the cozy room its bistro twist
The earnest waitstaff is refreshingly patient and accommodating even at their busiest
The Food The wine list is the real draw at this simple Italian spot; it features an above-average list of Italian wines that go well with the respectable salami and cheese platter served with sparingly oiled focaccia, and homemade spaghetti with a fresh tomato sauce that holds its own
The prosciutto cotto, taleggio and asparagus panino is served on uncompromisingly chewy bread, while fresh fettuccine is marred by a drab lobster sauce
I planned a small surprise gathering for a birthday dinner (8 people) and it was definitely the perfect place! They called me in advance to ask if I would mind coming in a little earlier and called to confirm my reservation as well
I don't think I have ever had a restaurant keep in such great contact! Everyone loved it--this place is such a gem!
after reading the review, we were sorely disappointed
The waitress was rude and neither of the waitstaff was assigned to a section of tables, as they constantly asked us the same questions, resulting in the food taking twice as long to come to the table
While the salmon had a delicious sauce, the portions were small
The steak was leftover gristle, and at $14 hardly a value
While the wine selection is nice, the staff is not trained in the edict of serving it
What a great little find in the West Village ! Very romantic, excellent and authentic Italian food and good service
Inn a neighborhood full of so so restaurants, this place is a winner
We walked through the village looking for a nice place to eat, and discovered I Tre Merli
What a find! Excellent food and so reasonably priced
The waitstaff is wonderful and so is the wine selection! It's not large, but great for a dinner for 2 or group of 5-7
We were treated like family upon entering
at the door, the bar and at the table
The bartender offered a tasting of their substantial wine selection to my undecisive girlfriend while we waited briefly for our table
We had the meat and cheese tray, a great pair with one of their bold reds, and large enough to be a meal for two on it's own
We went on to have a pasta and a fish dish, and they were quite tasty
And all for one $, you'd have to search to find a better value
this place is small, but the food is very good
try the penne with speck
so good
the spaghetti with tomato sauce is also worth a try
very, very fresh
they also have a great wine list and the wait staff is very friendly
i would definitely suggest giving this place a try
and the wine selection is excellent also
really a charming little place with great food
perfect for a quiet evening
Mandler's is a fabulous place with a large menu and the best sausages I have ever eaten
There are 11 different types of sausage ranging from chorizo to knockwurst to chicken, all on delicious European style rolls
Toppings are super and the mustard bar is a delight
Side dishes are awesome and the french fries and zucchini fires are great
Breakfast is served anytime, with pancakes, eggs, omelets, sausage etc
Beer and wine are also served and is 2 For 1 after 3:00 p
m
The food is quite substantial here and one never leaves hungry! I was very impressed with the quality of the food and large portions
Great value for the money!
If you like spicy sausages, try the Bratwurst w/ spicy sauce, mushrooms unions on onion bread, it was the best sausage I've ever tasted
The zucchini fries were also pretty good We also tried Sausage # 3 on the menu and that pretty plain but the Bratwurst is definitely worth the trip there
The Scene This small, low-lit corner restaurant is invitingly crafted, beginning with a pond by the window and continuing with lilac cushions, dark wood grille-work and mottled ceramic dishes
The organic details encourage a relaxed mood among the understated local crowd, and suit the confident cooking
Service is on the ball
The Food Dishes are steamed, sauteed and fried to a vibrant peak
Thai crab cakes are plump and meaty, brightened with lemongrass mayo; crisp corn fritters boast juicy kernels; and the pad see iew's broad noodles tossed with egg and broccoli are sweet, firm and refreshing
The house's whole fried red snapper holds a bold topping of mint, cilantro, scallion and red onion
Along with Thai, the kitchen does a nice turn with Vietnamese recipes, including a tender, spicy beef with bamboo shoots, and a strong Vietnamese coffee, sweetened with condensed milk
It is very small, quiet, and romantic
The food is just fantastic and the service is exceptional
Chai is hands down my favorite Thai place
I do not even know whether this food is authentic Thai or not, but it surely tastes amazing
I always order appetizer: crab cakes or satay; soup: tom yum gun; entre: duck with pineapple curry or fried fish with sweet and sour chilly sauce; desert: definitely fried ice cream with orange sauce and passion fruit green tea
I am very constant with my choices, but my bf always orders something new, and not even once he was disappointed
They also offer great variety of sakes, beers, and wine
The price is very reasonable
For two people we always spend no more than $70 for a full course meal
However, be aware that they only accept cash and on weekend do not take reservations
Don't waste your time
There are so many places in the area where there is good food and decent customer service
The food is fine, but when you're treated very disrespectfully, that can only go so far
what's their hipster gimmick? Square plates!! Our first visit here
I was with 3 friends, one a vegeterian
All 4 dishes were good, service was fine
So many Thai places in Williamsburg now
I hope Thai doesn't go out of style because it is my favorite cuisine
So how does Chai stack up? Considering price, portion, and taste, it's right there with Planet Thai

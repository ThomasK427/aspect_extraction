Just had dinner here and found the burgers to be H-U-M-O-N-G-O-U-S!! Fresh, lean and a great variety to toppings to choose from
From guacomole to raw onion
Place was quaint, rest of menu offered something for everyone (vegetarian or turkey-based, too)
Only drawback was beef was bland
Lacked character unique taste in of itself
Salt? Maybe a little spice? Otherwise, very fresh handmade goodness
The burgers here are great, but ask for a long island ice tea as a early Saterday evening kick off, they are SOOOOOO STRONG and come in a pint glass! One of thoes and the towns yours!
Where else can you go and order a burger and get a BURGER!? The servings are large, the prices are great, the staff from Steve the manager to Allie the bartender
TOP NOTCH! A comfy place to enjoy a real burger
NUFF SAID!
There is very little else to say
Everyone in New York City knows that when you really want a hamburger and nothing else will do
the only place to go is Jackson Hole
This has been my favorite for YEARS
I have to say, that I'be tried the others and this still remains the best!  The Eastsider burger is lost in the toppings
give it a try!
Big portions for those that have that hungry man appetite
Burgers are colossal
Made your way
Quite mid-western setting
If you want the best burger in the city (same thing as in the world) than get yourself to a Jackson Hole
It would be nice to have one downtown on the westside but it's worth the schlepp
beef is king! even though bison is the newest trend, jackson hole proves that beef is king! this is definitely the place of the best burger up North (now, in Nw'Orleans--well, that's another story)
the meat is juicy-- eating a burger here is like eating a dripping taco elsewhere-- tender, spicy
just great!
Though large in size, the burger I had was fair in taste
I think next time I will stick with a Cesar salad which looked terrific as well as the veggie sandwich
great deal on yummy burgers
selection is varied enough to please everyone in your group
You get a lot to like at Jackson Hole and you don't pay much for it
The best burgers in interesting surroundings for not much money
This burger was monster sized
I think one burger could definitely feed two people
Pretty good too
And they deliver really late at night
I don't know if the burger was really good 'cuz it really was good, or 'cuz it was so butt late and I was desperately hungry
I would eat there again though
Make sure to be hungry when heading to Jackson Hole
The most burger combinations I've ever seen
Very good hand-formed burgers
The fries are far inferior to the burgers
Those are some damn good hamburgers
Definitely better than Burger Heaven, although about comparable in price
Loaded up with lots of good stuff (such as avocado, blue cheese, feta, Brie, etc
), these burgers are still under $10, even with fries
And they do cook 'em exactly like you want 'em, not all medium, like some places do, as if they are only humoring you by asking how you want your burger cooked
If you say bloody, it'll be bloody
The entree salads are also quite good
There is plenty of seating and it's clean
The Scene Les Halles has always been a popular spot with theatergoers and residents of its well-heeled Murray Hill neighborhood
But in its ninth year, with the publication of chef Anthony Bourdain's tell-all "Kitchen Confidential," Les Halles turned into one of the more festive spots in town
Stroll in at nine on a Tuesday evening and you'll be lucky to grab a seat at the bar, but it's more than worth the effort
The Food The reason to come here is for beef, and the butcher case at the restaurant's entrance should tell you that right away
In addition to its great steaks, Les Halles also offers the best steak frites in the city, with long, oddly-shaped and crunchy frites that are simply unmatched
A nice selection of reasonably priced Rhone wines make for ideal accompaniments
Really well prepared French cuisine at a good price! The duck, roast chicken, and steaks are solid choices
Was a little disappointed when I recently tried the pork tenderloin
(should have ordered the duck!) Haven't had a chance to try any desserts as portions are quite large
Me and my Husband had a wonderful time here
Les Halles Truly offers the best steak frites in the city
The atmosphere is very warm and inviting
This is always an option when deciding on where to go out for a great meal and wine in the city
The food is great
I have yet to be disappointed
I've been a bi-monthly customer for going on five years
I have never had a bad meal, and crave the Cassoulet everytime the smell of autumn is in the air
Unfortunatelty the service has never been up to the same speed as the food
Since the expansion, especially, the service keeps going down hill
Perhaps the larger rookie staff hides the few veteran servers that are efficient and on their game
But unless you are lucky enough to be seated in the section of a veteran server, expect the arrogance and pure neglect of the rookies
Enjoy the food, because it is remarkable, but don't be too willing to be gratuitis to a server that does not deserve it
Coming from this native New Yorker, because as one server put it to me recently, Hey, that's New York!
Yeah it is, perhaps you don't get it!
Went for dinner - the escargot are to die for and the prime rib for two was very reasonable in NYC ($58) and absolutely delicious
Yum! We were put on the wait list, seated in 15 min after a quick drink at the bar and had an incredibly entertaining waiter and dined next to a few regulars who raved
Will definetly be back
My steak tartare and my hubby's medium rare steaks were sheer perfection! Warm potato salad with goat cheese was delicious and the fries were done just right
The servers were extremely friendly and we thought it was a total steal for the money we put down
I'll definitely go back there again in a heartbeat
OK, I admit I visited mostly because I'm a Bourdain fan
Knowing the reviews were mixed, I went for brunch to avoid the crowds
Salad and bread - nice
Steak - disappointingly arrived medium well and dry when I ordered medium rare
Fries - most were very crunchy and good, but some pieces were curiously chewy
Sorbet dessert - excellent, moderately sweet, not too tangy or tart like other places
I'd go back to try other dishes
I went there with high expectations, with the famous chef and all, but I was disappointed
Don't get me wrong, the food was far from bad, but the steaks, while perfectly done, were nothing to rave about
The French fries were excellent though - I would go there just for the fries
But the ambience was not all that great, and our French waitress was, what can I say - French, in terms of service
Girlfriend and I did the smart thing by going early on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch
Service was quick and polite
The ambience was loud and lovely, too
The blood sausages were amazing
and I had never had them before
YUM! Definitely one of the best birthday meals I've ever had
I made a reservation to take my cousing and fiance out to celebrate their engagement - they came in from Brooklyn just to meet us there
When we got there, they had no record of my reservation, and that we could wait at the bar for a table (it was packed)
When I tried to get to the bottom of how my reservation had just dissapeared, she said it happens all the time
like that was supposed to make me feel better

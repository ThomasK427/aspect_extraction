Food has always been over- priced, though I will still give credits to the creativity and presentation
The restaurant has also become very noisy
Service during dinner was alright, but one's perception to a restaurant usually starts from the very beginning: the entrance
I was appalled by the coat checker's attitude towards my guests, and that was how we started and ended our dinner which obviously help ruined the image of the notorious Nobu restaurant, a restaurant which was once my favourite fusion cuisine (not Japanese) in the city!
Group service at lunchtime is spotty, which would be all right, but for Nobu's being in a class above
happening yes - cindy randy dine unaccosted, cindy was gorgeously fab in very casual jean wear red top
woody entourage in back room also unasssuming
this is place to see people great that no one disturbs them with autographs! but the food
must try the chef's choice tasting menu - each offering was a treat!
pricey but if you do come you should expect to pay the $$$$
sushi was fresh/delish! appetizers entres well done/well presented
desserts can't avoid
The SUM IT: must try at least once, but like all NY top spots, reservations a must - can be weeks/months, but you can call for late cancellations
next door is also worth going for more unassuming atmosphere
For a very exclusive place
I thought the service and atmosphere would be better!! If your paying top dollar not only should the food be great the service and ambience as well
First of all, the waitress makes you feel like a little kid at school
I thought they should be a little be more freindly not just because its time to pay collect gratuity or because they want you out!
Nobu is great
The Tuna with salad is the most amazing dish
They are written up with a recommendation for the miso-cod, I love cod but would pass on this
Stick with the sushi which is outragous
I was there for lunch to see what the Nobu hype is/was about
Coatcheck was was a mess
Its seems everything was piled atop a windowsill
And person at the check was not very smiley
Service was very prompt and proper with a smile
The braised cod was define and it melted like butter in your mouth
The sushi was boering and not special at ALL
Cheap Chinatown soy sauce bottles on the tables
Design of interior is contemporary but contrived
Bathrooms looked like the bathrooms in Macy's herald square
Overall
good food
good smiley service
but nothing to support all that silly celeb hype
i have eaten at nobu over 100 times since it opened
at times i think they have slacked off and then i eat somewhere else and realize how good nobu is
really creative dishes presented perfectly
i prefer to eat at the sushi bar because i find the wait staff a little clumsy, and because the sushi chefs are really nice guys
oh, and don't make the mistake of ordering sushi only
the appetiver and other items are equally impressive
the best meal we ever ate in ny or any where else in this great country
An institution of Great food has become a watercooler restaurant
This is too bad
The expertise and beauty of the presentation and quality have slowly eroded and given way to the assembly line of Omakase
The food is now Really good, but far from great
With Morimoto taking his Iron Chef clout and act down to Philly, the best Neo Japanese has left town
Hollywood and the rest of those who need to be seen can keep Nobu
really creative presentation by highly skilled chefs in a beautiful atmosphere
if the service were a little bit more professional this would be perfect
but as it is it is sstill my favorite dining experience in NYC
While not in the same leauge as Blue Ribbon, or Sugiyama, Nobu is an awesome restaurant
We go there often enough, and live for the miso coated Sable
Yuuum! Scrumptious! Even the deserts here are to die for! Delicious! Hmmmmn!
Words do not do this restaurant justice
Find an excuse to break the bank and go all out
No worries if you're not familiar with Japanese cuisine, the excellent service fills the void
so long as you let them take a lead roll in your dining experience
Heed this advice - order one roll of sushi for a taste, but stick to the unique and flavorful dishes unparalleled by any other restaurant
Be warned
reservations required one month in advance
Indeed, Nobu is a tough place to make a dinner reservation
Since I am not a New Yorker, the time of stay is limited and decided to try lunch instead
The menu looked not-so-great, looked exactly like any other Japanese restaurant
So I decided to do a Omakase Chef's menu hoping that I would get something more exciting than just teriyaki, donburi, katsu etc
It was probably like a 6-course lunch (around $65)
Toro tataki in wasabi soy sause with yamamomo was good, but wasabi was way too strong that I almost forgot that there was a cavier garnishing
Sushi was part of the course, but I did not really care for it
My fave was well marinated cod with sweet miso glaze
My wait staff was very nice, casual, informative, and attentive
Make sure to try their fig martini
I would definitely go back there for dinner next time
The menu is very accomodating for sushi lovers as well as non-sushi lovers
I recommend the chef's choice that allows you to try some of the most interesting flavor combinations I have seen
You won't be disappointed
Also, try the black cod, you'll thank me
P
S
If you feel the staff is snobby, go for lunch, there is less attitude then
This is my 4th time Nobu-ing, on a Friday night
Nobu is killing itself with its celebrity status
Place wasn't packed, service was so-so
Squid pasta too salty
Waiter gave us wrong dishes
Uni spanich stale, ceviche way too sour and salmon roe crab way too greasy
It's still good (no doubt), but not as great as it used to
I'll do Nobu Nextdoor next time instead, or maybe try it on a weeknight instead
(And please, this is not really a sushi place
Go somewhere else for sushi)
The reservation staff was friendly and stories about snobbery are untrue
Service once we were sat was efficient and timely but not necessarly doting
The service was good but personalized
The highlight of the evening was the signature miso cod and the rock shrimp tempura
In following with previously four bold specialty dishes we expected the fifth dish to be just as bold of even bolder
Alas we were given an anticlimatic run of the mill nigiri
Lastly, overall ambiance was classy but certainly NOT romantic and the guests were pretentious
This is not a place for you if you expect to have Margaritas with real lime juice like the two Californians next to us
Or if you just came from Japan and you expect it to be a traditional sushi restaurant
Who orders margaritas nobu anyway?

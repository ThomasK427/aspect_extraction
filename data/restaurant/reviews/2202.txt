e DON'T TOUCH THE 500 DEGREE PLATE)I ORDERED THE CRAB CAKES AND HE HAD THE BARBEQUE SHRIMP
EXCELLENT START
FOR THE ENTREE, I HAD THE FILET HE HAD THE NY STRIP
ALTHOUGH GOOD, IT WAS NOTHING THAT COULDN'T BE DONE AT HOME
WHILE DISTRACTED BY FLASHES OF THE PAPARAZZI(DRUNK TOURIST WITH CAMERAS) WE DID MANAGE TO CARRY ON A CONVERSATION OVER THE 20FT TABLE
THE DRINKS WEREN'T BAD(THUMBS UP ON THE PEACH BELLINI) AND SERVICE WAS ON POINT
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE NIGHT
CREME BRULEE, CRAB CAKES
FOR 2 APPS, 2 ENTREES,2 SIDES, 3 DRINKS 1 DESSERT AND TIP THE BILL CAME TO $240
I'VE SEEN WORSE
OVERALL
RECOMMENDED
WOULD I GO BACK?
YES
IF SOMEONE ELSE PICKED UP THE CHECK
EVEN BETTER!
Everyone else but our waiter was very attentive, but he could not be bothered
I would hate for anyone to miss a Ruths Chris steak, but tonight our waiter was just
too busy with one other table, to be bothered
Very disappointing
We arrived early for our reservation and the staff was most accomodating
We were seated promptly and the service was very good
We started with Lobster Bisque and Louisiana Seafood Gumbo, which were excellent, followed by our entrees, a Petit Filet and a NY Strip which were cooked to perfection and accompanied by Sweet Potato Casserole which could have been presented as a dessert it tasted so good and Broccoli Au Gratin which was also very good
The desserts were out of this world and a fitting conclusion to a fine meal
The only improvement I would suggest would be to include a salad with the entree
Other than that, everything was outstanding
Heartily recommended!
I know it's a chain, but I swear every time I come here I marvel at the steaks
They really are as good as Luger, and the atmosphere is SOOOOO much nicer
If you can't make it out to Brooklyn, don't settle for crap like Wolfgangs
Check out Ruth's Chris
Went to dine at RC the other night and it was excellent
The food was delicious, the staff very curtious
The decor very nice
The cons I would say were there were some people dressed nicely, while others came in to dine in a sweatshirt or with cell phones in their ears
Definatly a turn off
The drinks are over priced in my book as well
All in all a very nice dinging experience
I will definatly go back again
After several visits I have had nothing but wonderful experiences
I look forward to return trips with eager anticipation
I have eaten at several ruthchris steak houses from dallas to ny, (including garden city)
I am always impressed by the consistency
The porterhouse steak for two is superb in every location
The service is exemplary, the ambience and friendliness of the staff is first rate
I have never had to wait for a table with a reservation
The only other restauant that compares is Peter Luger, and I prefer Ruthchris, the atmosphere is on a higher level
If you are looking for a truly great steak, do not pass up this restaurant
Too many cons to list
Very slow service, wait 30+ minutes for a terrible salad, wait another 45 minutes for two filets that were supposed to be cooked medium
One arrives well, one rare
Not impressed for $32 per filet
Waiter ignored us, never asked if we needed anything, never received a dessert menu or asked if we wanted coffee, or even the check
Finally found manager and asked for check to put an end to the miserable time-wasting experience
Manager offered a $50 gift certificate for next visit
Told him there would not be a next visit and to apply it to this bill, which he did
(Garden city location)
There's nothing better than a steak that arrives sizzling and sizzles throughout the meal!! Beautiful restaurant, excellent service, a wonderful experience!!
Food : A++ Service : A++ Value : A++ No other steakhouse in Manhattan can beat Ruth's Chris
The service is warm and professional while the food is out of this world
I went to Ruth's Chris with my family and we all ordered different things from the menu: vegetarian plate, stuffed chicken, tuna and of course a couple steak cuts
Everything came out piping hot and delicious
Dont get too full because the deserts are too good to pass up
This is by far the best steak house in NY!! I have sent friends and family here and they all have become fans!!
I have ate in Ruth's Chris steakhouse before and was impressed, however this time around the quality wasn't there
Apart from the rare to medium rare mistake on my steak, the food was ok and and not worth the money
I think outback steakhouse would have been better that night
WORTH THE WAIT!! VERY FRIENDLY WAITSTAFF, GREAT FOOD, BEST STEAK IN NYC, FAST SERVICE, ROMANTIC ATMOSPHERE
food was fantastic
must be terrible for my diet, but so mouth-wateringly good
service is the major drawback
Fiance and I asked to have a quiet/romantic table, and were seated adjascent to other loud groups
There were plenty of corner/booth and quiet seats available
when we asked to be moved, the hostess said she wouldn't want to inconvenice her waiters by having us sit away from other diners (at these prices, this leve of service is unacceptable!)
customers mostly tourists and can ruin the otherwise subdued atmosphere
despite these drawbacks, the food is good enough to draw me back for more
Listen
yes Ruth's are all over the country and yes they are a chain
but you know what
when we want a great steak and a great staff of people who really care and welcome you like family
its like going home
and what a steak
case closed
At the bar or at a table/booth
you can't go wrong
Where are my keys! Enjoy

I am a steakaholic and have eaten staek just about every good steakhouse in the city
Ruth Chris has the best steak by far! They come sizzling on a extremely hot plate and you can hear it sizzling even when your half finished with your steak! The BBQ shrimp in cajun butter is addictive and they have the best Creme brulle around! The place is pricey, but well worth it
I make it a point to dine here once a month if I can help it
Steak anywhere else just doesn't taste right
Leaves a void in my mouth
With scaffolding outside the building having been there for more than a year, the restaurant actually looks fairly grotty
This is a decent, acceptable steakhouse, but there is nothing special or redeeming to make this a destination trip at all
At the same price range, there are significantly more interesting steakhouses to venture to
My boyfriend took me here for our annyversary, sure it's not the most romantic plcae, but the food was reall great
The servive was good too
They were very polite and professional
I had salmon and spinach and it was really good
The meat wasn't too dry

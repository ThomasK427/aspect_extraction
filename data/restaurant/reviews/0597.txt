Im so surprised a place this nice hires such bad help
or so I thought since the manager bares a striking resemblance
A friend of mine recommended this really neat cozy spot in the Lower East Side so I had to check it out
The place is uniquely beautiful
Out in plain view is the biggest brick oven I have ever seen
(The only thing hotter that that oven is the manager!!!) I got the most juicy and tender veal chop
For dessert I had the apple crumble which was heavenly
I can't wait to go back!
we found it odd that such a nice place,with terrific food in a hot neighborhood was not packed on a thursday night at 8, the well mannered owner explained how business slowed down at the start of the war, hope this place out lasts the war because it quickly became our new favorite place
its so cute, the room is warm the people where nice, and the food teriffic, my kids loved the pizza and meatballs
it was nice to find a place in our neighborhood that dosent frown upon someone with no reservation,i mean come on this is the lower east side not upper east,well we enjoyed it very much,but because they sat us on a busy friday night and where happy to do it ,makes us happy to suport them again
I was totally not expecting anything extraordinary because the place got mixed reviews
Maybe that's a good way to go to a restaurant because I was floored
I would say that five out of the six dishes we ordered were excellent
The sixth dish, an open ravioli, was not terrible, it was just okay (a little too heavy for me)
The scene was really cool with an even mix of diners in their 20's, 30's and 40's
Apizz is definitely a place I would recommend
It has made my Top 5 list along with Craft, Bar Pitti, Ino, and Lupa
When my grandaughter asked me to meet her for dinner on Eldridge Street, I was a little aprehensive
Since she is a food writer, I have come to trust her restaurant choices and decided to join her for a meal at Apizz
I think I fell in love with this place even more than she did
She insisted we try the pizza, which was very good
I was more impressed with the wild boar lasagna and veal chop
they were both superb
The service is not exceptional but everyone that works there is very sweet
It was also very reasonably priced
We will both definitely go back!
before we sat down at apizz a waiter slaped down some serious red sauce ,ricotta cheese, and great country style bread, it was wonderfull, it was a perfect appetizer, its nice to see this , unlike most restaurants today barley put bread down , and if they do you have to beg for more,the bad part was we didnt order apps
,but the entrees where exellent, we will try and get back to order some apps
but that sauce is so good
went there after seeing a review about there panna cotta , i have to say it was pretty good
I never heard of using yougurt before but it was a nice flavoring, still not as good as mine, oh yeah food done the way i like,simple and good,
wow talk about a weird location,if you live above 34th st, anyway loved it ,the food is as good as the place is intresting,best hide out spot i found in a while
and lots of it ,i couldnt get enough of it,but my wife thought her fish had to strong smokeness to it,we both freaked over the pizza,and the place itself
everything just really nice, people,food,and the spot is great to turn friends on to
Love their pizza,worth trying to find a cab who knows where stanton st is
The pizzas were surprisingly good
The brick oven flavour was clearly apparent, but there was something else, perhaps an oil they used, that kept us guessing
The calamari was about the best I have ever had
We did not have any entrees, but we will definitely be returning to try them
The wine list is small, but easy to find something to go with anything on the menu
and reasonably priced to boot
I found myself at this cool little spot the other night based on a recommendation from a friend
He said he had the baby lamb chops and they were amazing
So, I wanted to taste for myself
He didn't bother to mention the pizza
The pizza is the best I've had in a long time
I have eaten at every pizza joint in the city
Even the new OTTO, which doesn't even compare
This pizza blows OTTO's away
The service is great and the food is spectacular
Don't miss out
Go there
We went here with a group of 8 people
And although it took about 45min to seat us the food was great
The pizza had a nice smokey flavor to it, the mozzarella was fresh and gooey
The wild boar lasagna excellent, the meatballs huge and good
The cheaper wines left a lot to be desired but they had some others on the list that were good
Great prices as well! Only one entree over $20!
Easy on the Salt?! - I think this is the first time I've ever uttered these words - considering the fact that I like my food on the saltier side
However our recent dinner at Apizz took this to really unpleasant levels
The pizza was good - however both our main courses were DOUSED in salt!! Follow this up with freezerburned gelato, and burnt capuccino and you have the makings of a pretty awful dinner
We ate on the 27th of December - so I am hoping that this was just an anomaly and perhaps the usual chef was away on holiday
I don't think I will try to test this place again anytime soon
P
S
I LOVE the sister restaurant Peasant - so I cannot understand why this meal was just so plain awful!
Last week I decided to let my palate try something new
I heard about this new spot in the lower east side called apizz (ah-beets)
I ordered the calamari as an appetizer which, by the way is the best I've had in NYC
For my entree, I went with the pork chops
When the dish was placed on the table my eyes could not believe the size
There were two succulent pork chops each about one inch thick served with sweet potatoes
I capped off the meal with an out of this world dessert
It was an apple crumble that looked like it could feed four
It was served with a scoop of vanilla gelato
Bring your appetite to apizz because when it comes to great food and great portions these cats don't play!!!!!
this is by far the most unique, intimate,understated downtown restaurant i have been to in years,no attitude,no problems,and great straight foward italian food,minus all the foo-foo food thats out there these days,definetly a find to bring that first date to and blow her mind where you are taking her,better hurry,i just read there review in NY mag
a nice find, belive me i know,being a chef
We were very excited to try Apizz after hearing about their unique brick-oven style of cooking
We are big fans of thin-crust brick-oven pizza and growing up in New York, we consider ourselves pretty on target when it comes to finding a good Italian place
Once seated, our excitement soon quelled
While the atmosphere was warm and inviting, the service was poor and unattentive
The bread served with sauce and cheese was the best part of the meal (and I'm not referring to the pizza which was, by the way, not crisp and completely bland)
The calamari were overcooked
The salad was overdressed and underseasoned
I went there twice: the first and the last time
If you want good Italian food, go to one of Mario Batali's places
If you want good pizza, go to Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, John's, or Nick's
But please, don't waste your time or your money here
its one of those restaurants you cant wait to turn your friends on to
You will never expect what they have done to this intimate little brick building,on a very low profile block,the setting is so warm and appealing ,it makes you feel at home right from the start,the glow from the enormous oven is so comforting,you cant wait to see what comes out of it, and when it does things only get better,,real home style meatballs,lasagna,and a whole grilled sea bass to die for,its big!! oh yeah,the service,very refreshingly freindly,,not an attitude in sight
If you've enjoyed eating at Peasant on Elizabeth St
, you'll love this smaller, more informal and wallet friendlier jewel of a restaurant
It's so good that you probably should keep it a secret only to your best and closest friends
The cozy decor, the feeling of Tuscany, the brick wood fed ovens and most importantly, the food and service makes this place a keeper and one that you'll want to return to as soon as possible
The menu is highly imaginitive with dishes that can truly be described as sophisticated Italian comfort food
As with Peasant the deserts are exquisite and a must
Encouraged by the reviews on this site, I eagerly made resrvations for dinner
We had no wait for our table

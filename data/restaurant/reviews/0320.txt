It's not even worth trying
The out door seating was very nice, though
If you wanna eat healthy and feed your tastebuds something interesting for a medium price this is the place
The health is definitely the key reason to go
Get educated about un cooked food and come enjoy the joys of real living
The ambience is nice as well especially when the 'wall of water' fountain is on - not during the drought
The tastes are a wonder also though and the after meal feeling of energy and comfort are a true gift
Books sold at the front for learning about the raw food recipes and techniques
This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not
Everyone is welcomed in as family
The food, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city
During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks
While I'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!
On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT
This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find! We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town
Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came
Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for
Try everything for that matter, it is all good
I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough
Hurley's is terrific! I love going there! The staff makes you feel at home, the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL! I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal
Great place to make reservations if you're going to a show

Def Jam Poetry
They all know you
Good food
Good drink
How do you rate home?
Stopped in by chance 12/8/02, glad we did
Very friendly staff and excellent food
Reminded my wife and myself of being back in Ireland
Intend to return
I brought my family which includes some picky eaters
Everyone loved what they had
I ordered tuna, and it was fabulous
The Scene With circa 1950s black-and-white photos, mosaic murals and ivory banquettes lining the walls, the attractive space evokes pre-Castro Havana
Live Latin music six nights a week, a dark wooden bar long enough to lean on and mingle at, and group-friendly seating arrangements create a festive scene
Smaller tables toward the front and out on the sidewalk offer more intimate dining
The Food The extensive tapitas side of the menu offers a solid Cuban sandwich, a fresh seviche mixto of octopus, calamari and shrimp, and other meat and seafood standards
Entrees include Cuban classics with upscale prices, like ropa vieja and arroz con pollo, as well as Son Cubano's excellent signature dish, rabo encendido, featuring tender chunks of oxtail in a light tomato sauce, served with white rice and delicious fried sweet plantains
Finish with another sweet and smooth Son Cubano mojito martini; the dessert menu is limited
Best Latin spot or Latin Themed spot in NY
Classy latinos, classy people, even that big security guard at the door is friendly
Nothing but the best experiences here
I went here a few weeks ago with a large group of people
We ordered the pre fix, which was unlimited sangria and appetizers
This was the biggest rip off ever! The sangria was very watered down and the appetizers were sub par at best
At $90 a person, it was not worth it
Even though the atmosphere was very cool, the food was not
I highly recommend against the pre fix
There are far better options for large group dining in the city
The food is good
Is it great? No
Is it worth the price
Nah
But the atmosphere, live music, great-looking bartenders and overall vibe (and locale) make it a perfect date spot or drink-and-greet venue
You're guaranteed to look much hotter at this bar than some dive, so dress up and go in for some apps and sangria
No need to do dinner, use the extra money to check out one of the great bars in the Meatpacking afterwards
The food was good, granted
But the waiter was useless
The hostesses were awkward at best
And the bus boys were annoying as could be
Every time we moved they were lurking looking for an opportunity to take something away and essentially make us feel rushed
Again, good food isn't nearly enough in a neighborhood with hundreds of other offerings
Probably won't be going back
A true Latin atmosphere which includes tasty cuban food, fabulous mojitos and a live band playing spanish songs you can dance to
A great time!
I went on 4/20/06 with two other friends to celebrate a promotion
We went in about 4:30 p
m
we had appetizers, drinks, dinner, desert and when we wanted more sangria a guy in a suit came to the table brought us the bill and said I cancelled the sangria you have been here since 4:30 and it was 7:30 p
m
I need the table and just walked away
Very unprofessional, I think someone should have said from the beginning there was a time limit
I wanted to do a large gathering but after that fiasco I will never go back
The tapas are delicious, all of them! They recently changed chefs and I was worried, but the food is still great
They took a lot of my favorites off the menu though, which limits the menu :( THe wait staff can be flaky, rarely is it great service
Good drinks, love thw live music
THe decor inside is one of the best parts
You usually have to wait even if you have a reservation, but nothing too bad, you can just enjoy the live music and great drinks
One of my favorites
When I made reservations, I asked to be seated away from the center of the floor
They couldn't promise but said they would try to accomodate
They had a table for us on time but we decided to wait for a out-of-the-way table
About 30 min later we were seated
The food and the drinks were good but we missed the dessert because the kitchen closed
Once the tables were removed, the place turned into a club
If you go here on a Friday/Sat
nite in the meat packing district, of course, you will have to wait!!! I have always gone here on the weekday before 9pm
The mojitos are one of the best in NYC and food is yummy
Never had a bad dish yet
Even the intricate salad was good
Bar staff waiters are all very friendly and service is always good
It def
gets very noisy after 9pm which is why I always request a table in the front, away from the back seating where the band might be playing
I always make reservations even though not always needed if early enough
I do not think a place can get more pretencious that this one
From the unfrienly bouncer to the rude promoter and the unhelpful bartenders
I urge everyone to avoid this place unless they are willing to put up with a whole bunch of to-good-for-you staff members

Very cool atmosphere, as a matter a fact ran into people we knew! All in all I definitely recommend this place, the food was excellent, the atmosphere fun and young much more inviting than the other 2 restaurants Pastis and Balthazar
Showed up 'round 10pm with a friend on a rainy Thursday, waited at the bar for maybe 10 minutes before sitting down
Bartender host both were cool
GREAT, boisterous atmosphere, and while loud (not a sound-absorbing surface in the place!), it was a fun, young kinda loud
A DJ started spinning around 11ish, and there were open tables by 11:30
Food was fantastic -- especially for the price
Friend had the shrimp appetizer, loved it, and i dug my watercress/bleu cheese salad
He had mussels, said they were fabulous, and my steak frites was EASILY one of the best I've ever had
Didn't do dessert
The wine is GOOD, and cheap
1/2 caraffe for $8, $9, or $10
I'd gladly come back just to drink, but the food made the night
I actually liked it more than Pastis
Went there last night with two friends, one who is 50 years old, the other 28
We were 1/2 hour late for our reservation, but it was not a problem
We ALL had a great time! The small plates to start with were great and everyone just loved their entrees
Our waitress was also great (despite the pressure from her manager to get us to get up after dinner b/c it was getting very crowded)
The scene was also very good
More model-types the later it got
Would highly recommend Schiller's
This was a terrible dining experience
Our waitress was rude and MIA most of the meal- my glass was always empty
The place was so full that people from the bar had their purses and elbows in our faces, and it was so loud we could hardly hear each other
The restaurant manager had a bad attitude and only wanted to turn our table over quickly
Which was fine with me because the seats were so uncomfortable!  The place was empty when we arrived, and still we were not seated until the third person in our party arrived
I would not reccommend this place to anyone!
Eating at Schiller's was perhaps the worst dining experience of my life
The restaurant was so crowded that people at the bar were spilling over into the people trying to eat
And there wasn't much room for the people at the bar to stand either, as the restaurant attempted to squeeze as many tables into the restaurant as they could, forcing those dining to have to shift in their chairs every time a waiter attempted to get by
The seats were uncomfortable, which was only exacerbated by the overwhelming heat in the restaurant
As if that wasn't bad enough, my meal was completely overcooked
Finally, the noise level was so loud that I could barely carry on a conversation at a two-person table
I would not reccommend this restaurant at all
We headed to Schiller's to grab a drink and were delightfully surprised
Apparently this is where everyone goes on a Thursday night since everywhere else in the LES was empty
Ambience inside is classic McNally - definitely had a French feel although the bar is also somewhat remniscent of a 1950s aesthetic
Dimmed lights and candlelit tables
Crowd was mixed - some young loud college kids drinking beer, alongside attractive early 30s crowd, and bearded intellectual types
Although the tables are cramped they let you sit just to grab drinks
Only complaint is they need more space! Will definitely be back for happy hour
get your act together kids! I went there for a late Saturday brunch with some friends
The Welsh Rarebit was below average-the cheese was runny and the bread was horrible (take some lessons from Tea and Sympathy) and the burgers and buns were burned
The service was not the greatest as well
The best part about the meal (which was not even prepared in the restaurant) were the baked goods from Balthazar's! I know it takes a while for new restaurants to get their acts together but it's been long enough!
I don't follow who's who in the restaurant world and had no clue this was a new place by someone important
Went their for a friend's birthday and thought the hour and half wait, ridiculous noise, insulting maitre d, and incredibly crappy food were bad enough
When I realized that people were actually impressed with this mess of a place because of some hot new chef, all I could think was this emporer has no clothes
Open your eyes, people! Who cares about McNally if the food sucks, you can't hear, the host insults you, you're squeezed into a teensy weensy table and on top of it, you WAIT FOR ALL THIS?!?
my oh my does keith mcnally have it right
schiller's is yet another gem serving up french style comfort food
on a friday night, it took a while to get seated but it was well worth the wait
the calamari was perfectly crisped, pork chops juicy and bursting with flavor with every bite and the bar steak was cooked to perfection
the wine list is tad short but sufficient
i recommend going when you're not too hungry since the wait might be long
I had an excellent experience here the other night
The food was great
I was seated in 2 minutes on a Saturday night and I had excellent, prompt service
I will deffinitly be going back when I am in the neighborhood
spent my bday there with a group of friends and had a great experience
we were seated practically immediately (on a friday night @ 8!) and the whole experience was fabulous
it gets crowded quickly so be on alert but the well worth the trip
and get tasters for the table, 4 for $11, includes delicious beets, chickpeas and olives
martinis were pretty tasty too
Schiller's delivered the Goods
Great food, great service, great value
I ate by myself- the leg of lamb w/ the potatoes gratin and a 1/2 carafe of Good red wine- a melbec
The lamb was faultless and the potatoes and the malbec were perfect complements
I ate at 6 bfore it become too crowded and too noisy
Will definitely return
$30 less tip
The mussels and frits were great, but the host had an attitude and my friends and I waited about 1 1/2 hours to be seated on a random Tues
night--and it was my birthday!
I went for a late brunch on a Saturday afternoon
Hostess and waitress (+ other waitstaff) were great, always smiling and ready at your side to pour water, ask if you need anything, whatever (maybe a little too much actually?)
I had the huevos rancheros which was just so-so
Atmosphere was upbeat and loud, so don't go if you want something relaxing and quiet
I am shocked at the rudeness of the staff (hostesses) at this place
I thought it might just have been the first time, but it happened on other repeat visits (I live around the corner)
The food is decent enough and the drinks are stiff, but someone should tell McNally to have a talk with these people
it's the LES! It's supposed to be the most chill neigborhood in the city! These hostesses aren't saving lives, they're seating people at a restaurant
They seriously need to adjust there attitudes
Went here for a casual Sunday night dinner at 7:45pm; dinner was served at 10:15pm! The food wasn't bad, but what could be worth a 2 1/2 hour wait? Beligerent treatment from the hostess topped it off
Would never go back
rude staff seemed to think being uncomfortable, unfed and insulted was our problem
Without a doubt the worst service, food, value and experience by far of any restaurant i have recently been to in NYC
My 5 friends and I had the WORST experience at McNallys new joint
Waited 1 1/4 hours for a table, watching as the rude hostesses seated THREE people in a SIX top
We finally were seated at a FOUR top (one of my friends is 6'6 and 250 lbs
) We then demanded a seat change which they reluctantly gave us, then proceeded to wait an HOUR for our food
My husband left, the experience was so awful
The food was horrendous, too much olive oil, the tuna was fatty, and we were STARVED so I am sure I am doing the food more justice than it deserved
I was shocked and dismayed after having been to Pastis so many times
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!
Fortunately after seeing the disappointed faces on those that were wasting their money and listening to the absurd conversations taking place at tables full people, who instead of talking to one another were chatting on their cell phones, we bailed and walked up the street to a really excellent restaurant
You come to this neighborhood for the atmosphere and great original food
Schiller's just doesn't fit in
This place seems determined to create quite a name for itself
No -- not for its food, or atmosphere, but for the sheer rudeness that can make even a native New Yorker blush!  After being seated late for our reservation and food brought out at lightning-quick speed, we were kindly asked to finish our wine and pay up as other guests were waiting to dine at this fine establishment
All this after being seated at the table for a grand total of one hour! When we said that we would like coffee, the maitre d' offered to buy us dessert if we would just leave the table!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! There are just too many other options
If it's rudeness you really seek just take the subway to another restaurant :)

I noticed this place while sitting in traffic trying to get into the Holland tunnel
It is now my favorite place
Very small, understated, incredible incredible food
So simple and perfect
I always get the honey and soy chicken wing appetizer
Then its either the miso glazed salmon or anyone of the salads
The ginger tea is exceptional
Writing this makes me want to go there tomorrow
The staff is great
Always so pleasant
I tried the snow pea dumplings once and I just can't resist going back for them
The best dumplings in town
Chinatown can't compare
The menu is simple, food quality is superb, service is personable and price can't be beat! The only disadvantage is its undertone local diner ambience
So even though I love this place, I don't think it's a place for parents in town or dates
i love, love, LOVE this place! the food is great, the service quick and the owners are so friendly!! everything on the menu is tasty, ive had it all!! do yourself a favor and go quickly!
I have now eaten at Mooncake Foods a few dozen times and I cannot come up with enough good things to say about it
I have tried almost everything on the menu, including the whipped taro, and I have never once been dissapointed
The food is exceptional; each dish has a unique twist, whether it is the spicy wasabi mayo on the tuna burger (which is fabulous) or a spicy lime vinagarette on a salad, Mooncakes does not shy away from trying something new
There are few restraunts that offer such a variety of unique and innovative flavors at such a low cost
Tasty, healthy, friendly, and reasonably priced
I eat there weekly for lunch and especially like their assortment of wonton noodle soups
Though you can purchase a wonton noodle soup just as tasty down the street in Chinatown for 1/2 the price, the No MSG policy makes it well worth it
Appetizers are reasonably priced while the rest of the menu is Soho priced
No prentension, no reservations needed, no scene, no hipsters, no attitudes, no overpriced food, no BT, no Eurotrash, no socialites, no credit cards, and no loud music
Great food and great people at an affordable price make this Asian-influenced diner near the Holland Tunnel one of NY's best kept secrets
Mooncake does what many restaurants in the super-saturated Manhattan market fail to do -- stand out
The menu boasts flavorful, healthful food from a decent but not overwhelming selection
I consider myself a regular, and dinner for 2, including appetizers, drinks, and a dessert, barely rounds out at $30
The summer rolls remind me of the ones I've had at Vietnamese restaurants, minus Centre St
The honey-soy chicken wings are to die for
As for entrees, the plates are divine, (chicken, porkchop, salmon) as is the lemongrass shrimp salad and Thai steak salad
Go ahead, explore -- there is nary a miss on this menu
I have not had any of the sandwiches, but I've heard good things about the new lobster w/ garlic butter
This Soho gem is definitely a place where one easily becomes a regular
even if they take residence in the Upper West Side
Mooncake is place to go with friends when you're on a budget
Entrees are all under $10 and you can bring your own wine for even more of a bargain
The owners are all extremely friendly and take care of their patrons very well
I consider myself a regular and haven't had a bad item on the menu yet--although the miso salmon and thai tuna salad are my favorites
Great overall value; most menu items are under $10 and are very creative (pork chop sandwhich with mango chutney)
The ginger ice tea was new and very tasty and the service was great and personal
Plus the place is BYOB
The only complaint I have is that the place is a bit run down and very small (at best fits 15-20 people)
Not a great place to impress a date, but good for an inexpensive dinner with friends
This place has yummy foods at a well affordable price
I definitely recommend the wings to start things off
This place is a little jewel tucked in a forgotten corner of the city
The food is fresh, delicious, and doesn't put a dent in your wallet! The service is great, they literally treat you like one of the family
The newest addition to the menu is a fantastic buttery garlic lobster tail sandwich
yummmy!  -Mei
We found this little Thai restaurant searching the Web
I've been to Thailand many times - the food is fabulous and authentic, I would even say addictive
This restaurant is one of those little gems that will become one of your favorite dining spots
Nothing special here folks
Have orderd from there and eaten there a few times
Not bad, not good
Average Mexican food
Worth a meal every couple months to mix it up
I like Cosi in general
I love this particular Cosi
Decor wise, it is much larger than most other sandwich shops with comfy couches and a large seating area
Service wise, everyone who works here has always been pleasant
However, the bread (that they use to make the sandwiches) at this particular Cosi is unbelievable
The freshly baked bread is so great I find myself contemplating getting everytime I hit Chelsea
Definately worth a try
My favorite is the Tuscan Pesto Chicken
I had a very pleasant experience
food was ok
service was great! would go again
if desire fo sushi appears while walking down MacDougal
If you enjoy sushi, this is NOT the place to go
The price and quality of the fish is average, and I would not even consider a non-sushi/non-sashimi dish
Everything seems to be laden with broccoli and tomatoes, changing the dishes' taste from what you would expect and what it should be
The soup tasted old, the salad dressing watery and oily, and the teriyaki dishes do not have an authentic teriyaki taste
To top it off, the service was terrible
The waitress forgot a soup, 3 salads and a bowl of rice and ignored the table for 10-15 minutes at a time
If you don't like your food, too bad - you are expected to pay full price for food you cannot eat
The food is NOT for japanese food lovers, and neither is it for people who enjoy quality of service
It's NOT the best sushi in NYC, but it's an incredible deal given the very decent quality of the fish
Over time, the quality might've gone down a tad, while the prices have gone up
(Early last year, the fish was phenomenal AND an incredible bargain--$1/piece during happy hour! They took away the happy hour and now the fish is less flavorful, too
) But the friendly service remains impeccable and generous
Given the (lack of) ambience, it's not a good first date place, but it's wonderful for everyday if you love sushi and aren't a multi-gazillionaire
I love pizza
and when its good its good
this pizza is the BEST!!!!! Order in (ok could sometimes end up overcooked, or cold from delivery time) but otherwise its
amazing
the fresh ingredents  great for those 3am after 3rd ave bars
place to meet people talk
sober up and have GREAT PIZZA
The rolls are delicious, everything tastes fresh and the presentation is well executed
One of my favorite places in NYC for sushi -- I'm glad it's in my neighborhood
The seating is a bit cramped, but the food is worth it
If you want down-to-earth, fresh sushi, you should try this place, if you are looking for a scene, then you should look elsewhere
They do take out too!
This place is packed every night
It is strange that Zagat does not rate it
the sushi is excellent
I would even say top 10 in NYC--and I have been to a lot of sushi places

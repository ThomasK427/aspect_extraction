Nonetheless, the food is good (though not by any means the best around) and the atmosphere is cheery enough to help relieve the annoyance of spending an hour waiting outside
The brunch here is fabulous
However, my last experience was not pleasant
The staff was not friendly and looked annoyed when you attempted to get their attention
We waited 45 minutes to get a table
After being the last group waiting but the first people there we finally left without a meal and ate across the street
It was extremely disappointing
brownies that are legendary
good comfort food, but you can't leave without that brownie, nothing comes close
Great taste, very reach
!!! worth every penny
Huge portions, awesome!!! very recommended
usually this place is pretty reasonable, but stopped in for a piece of pumpkin pie and was charged $4
30! Just a warning to ask the price if you're at all price-conscious
Pie was pretty decent, but a bit bland
lunch and breakfast are pretty good, but this is the kind of place that can be really great one day and just so-so the next
the take-out sandwiches vary greatly in quality
but the sweets are usually really good -- coconut pie is yum!
Amazing menu with tons to choose
Read the whole thing before you pick or you may be jealous of the plate next to you
i love this place because it is right by my apartment, but i wouldn't trek across manhattan to eat there
I'll admit that there's better strawberry butter to be had in NYC, but the excellent food, service, and ambience make this a worthwhile downtown stop anyway
The decor is cute and retro without being overly kitschy
Biscuits, bacon, and garlic oven fries are all wonderful, and someday I'll have room to try and comment on the heavenly-looking baked goods in the display case
Brunch doesn't get much better than this charming TriBeCa eatery
Go for the red pepper and artichoke omelette, or maybe the blackberry pancakes, or maybe just a huge scone with strawberry butter and a plate of New York's best bacon!! But leave room for dessert
You won't want to miss out on the three-layer chocolate cake or the massive cookies
If not the greatest on earth, Kitchenette at least has a claim to be the best in New York
The interior is shabby-chic, but the food ranges from comfort to sublime
The breakfast combinations on weekends are particularly inspired
The only problem is that, as word spreads, it gets harder and harder for Tribeca locals to get in as easily as they used to
the best cornbread, macn cheese, shepards pie, coconut cake, fish cakes, fried chicken
nedd i say more?
Absolutely the best Breakfast/Brunch below 14th street
If you love crisp Bacon, and fruit pancakes - this is the place to go
Great Staff (I vote for Louise)
Get's a bit crowded on weekends
so I usually order in
If you're taking a day off from work , come by for breakfast and relax and read the papers
Hey,,,, we love the lobsters rolls and we miss dinner (downtown)
its just the cutes little place with cute food, big portions( well mostly) all very tasty
when in doubt do meatloaf
Cozy and delicious!! Down home American home cooking - and don't forget the yummy desserts!!!
If you missed sub-par country dining, then this is the place for you
The food is nothing special
I could cook this at home
The food is overpriced, and the service is pretty horendous, but the desserts are good and you'll want to shag the waitstaff
Kitchenette's Mac and Cheese is unreal!! Let me start there
The food was great and the deserts were even better
A great place for some good down-home country cooking
Great prices too
I had dinner, but I can only imagine how good brunch is!! Bravo! NY loves cheap, fresh and delicious food!!!
Everyone comes to Kitchenette for brunch, and rightly so
Lunch and brunch are often crowded, but dinner is completely different - I often have the restaurant to myself and it's possible to have a private conversation
Burgers, salads, sandwiches, and the mac and cheese are all highly recommended
I also love the meatloaf
Save room for dessert - the layer cakes are to die for!
don't normally find myself in sports bars--but headed downtown to see the yankees friday night
mudville has great food--and is inexpensive
wings were great, salads were huge, burgers looked awesome
I also found out they deliver all over downtown which is great for me because I work downtown and order food in all the time
this place is awesome---they have all you can eat wings and beer for 2 hrs for $18 per person
the wings are great
the best in nyc--i went for a work event and come back every sunday for football
the best part about the football is you can watch all the games at the same time
Being from Buffalo, I will attest these are the best wings in New York City
They also have an internet jukebox with 10,000 songs, but the bartender has been known to skip your song if she doesn't like it
Great low-key hangout when you don't want to feel like you're in a city
Just happend to walk-in for the first time, and felt right at home
The wings were meaty (I actually order too much), and the sauce was great
The Servers were a great conversation, and they had every game on
Plenty of TVs to go around if you want to watch something else
Great Place, and I will return!
Mudville has, bar none, the best buffalo wings around
They are terrific, very big and meaty and the sauce selections are delicious, so flavorful and tasty
Actually, the mild sauce has just the perfect amount of hotness, everyone will be pleased
Yummy blue cheese too, not the cheap watery kind
And I've heard the burgers are amazing
There's lots of joy in Mudville! Plus, they serve beer and they deliver all night!
This is right by ground zero and has always been the best slice you can get
Standing room only and best on nice days so you can grab and go
From the pizza to the pasta there is no better in the city
The calzones are the best I have ever tasted
great food and cocktail reasonable prices and delicious food! Have been goin there for more than 10 years
On a recent business trip to New York, my colleagues and I stopped here for lunch
The food and service were excellent
(recommend the Osso Bucco and risotto)
Even though we had under an hour for lunch, the atmosphere and warmth of this establishment made for a very relaxing experience
Food is good, service is OK and drinks are flowing
Good atmosphere, stick with the Irish fare and the sea food, and the burgers are great
A couple of small TVs to watch sports, a Golden Tee machine, a dart board and proximity to an OTB make this a good game time hangout and the staff will make you feel at home, especially home is an Irish or British pub
I have visited various Burritovilles in the NYC area and this has got to be the worse
First of all most of them have dimmed lights and this one looks like you can perform surgery in it
The chicken quesadilla was disgusting
It was drenched in some sort of sauce that made the entire thing look and taste sloppy
The tortilla was barely heated
where it shouldve at least been charred
I went there during the winter and they had no source of heat! It was freezing!
The Scene A harvest display, lace curtains and tapestries draped over peach pastel walls lend a homely feel to this small, unprepossessing room
A platoon of waiters darts around, anticipating every need of the Wall Streeters and Tribecans who make Il Giglio a regular port of call; diners are barely in their seats before complementary salami, parmesan and bruschetta have been delivered

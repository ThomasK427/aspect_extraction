Great food
Amazingly beautiful outdoor space
From start to finish a really excellent time
The service was some of the best ive experienced anywhere in NYC
You get the feeling that there is nothing that you could ask for that wouldnt be accomodated
Very attentive, knowledgeable and good humored staff
Definitely see being a regular especially once it warms up
The garden is out of this world
My wife and I had a wonderful experience at Paradou on a recent Saturday night
We arrived at 9:30, and the place was packed with a great energy
The back room (a tented courtyard) had an interesting effect of making us feel transported from the city
Despite being busy, service was attentive and good
But the best thing about the experience was the food
The lamb with lavender rice was one of the best dishes I have had in a long while
My wife enjoyed her steak very much as well
Try the cheese plate - the chef's home-made confitures are as good as any we have had in France
The bill was very reasonable given the ambience, service and wonderful French food
One more thing, although the place is very romantic, it looks like it would be a lot of fun with a large group of friends as well
I used to love this charming place, but about a year ago it seemed to get a little stale
I thought it was on the slippery downward slope, but Paradou's reborn
Its still completely unpretentious in the terribly pretentious Meatpacking, but they've certainly spiffied up the joint
The garden has been completely redone and is amazingly beautiful
The waitstaff is very friendly, knowledgeable and fun
They've recently brought in a new Chef and the guy is incredible
Everything we had was incredible - from the foie gras to the cheeses to the skate to the incredible rosemary creme caramel was insane
Theyre also doing a lot of great events (I picked up a calendar) - movies in the garden, cheese wine tastings, cabaret style live music and lots of other stuff
I am glad that this place is going strong
Its definitely won its place back in my heart
I have been to paradou for almost 3 years now and never had a chance to write a review
I have seen its evolution over the years (food, service, back garden!) and I have to say I am very impressed: food is succulent, service got much better, and the vibes are cool! Their cheeses are tasty, cassoulet is a signature dish (not too fan about the cinammon but
), and their tartin tatin is a must
Great place to go and have a great time in the crazy meatpacking district
food- to die for!
outstanding! , excelent service, great wine ,but they have just french
sexy barman, and very cool music!
After a great start to a fun evening, the server (ie
manager) decided to neglect our party of 13 for an hour to have a personal conversation
When we walked over to him to request more beverages, he all but shooed us away
We therefore tracked down another server to take over
Also, my entree was fish that was so overcooked a steak knife would barely cut through it
The unattentive server then attempted to charge the table 20% gratuity after his blatant neglect
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!
Popped into Paradou this past Monday
This place certainly has changed since my last visit a couple of years back
The garden is AMAZING!!!! The food is superb
Very sophisticated
I had the Dry fruit stuffed Pork Chop
Out of this world
My friends had the cassoulet and the vegetarian cous cous and both were great
We shared some apps - beet tart, kobe tartar - outstanding
The all French wine list is very solid as well
They also have an outstanding cheese plate paired with very unusual house made jams
All this was very nice
The thing that made the evening great was the movie
It seems that they're starting to show movies in the Garden every monday
When we came in they were showing Casablanca on a huge screen
The waiter told me that February was Humphrey Bogart month
Definitely coning back for Key Largo
Went here first time this weekend on a first date
A friend recommened it
Buying that friend a drink
Very cool place
Excellent garden in the back
Very romantic
Dimply lit
Candle chandeliers
Definitely sets the mood
Food was great also very sensual
Had the foie gras and the sashimi
Beautiful and delicious
The entrees were killer as well
Had the skate with wild rice and the short ribs
The wine list is all French
id like to see some others, but still very good and well priced
This place is really good for all reasons - dates, dinner with friends, family, whatever
Will defintely be back
Went to Paradou for first time with friends
Expected to find a typical Meatpacking scene
Was so incredibly surprised
This place is magical
Their garden is one of the most beautiful and romantic spots in New York
High ceiling
Beautiful lighting
They have like over 100 candles lighting the place
The food, wien and service were all very good
We had the foie gras and beet tart
These are great
For entrees I had the seafood in parchement paper
The best, most flavorful seafood ive ever had
My friends had the steak and lamb chops
Both were excellent
I highly recommend Paradou
Thought I wasnt going to be going back to the Meatpacking, but I'm definitely coming back here
on a date
Used to be a regular, stopped coming for a while, but now its back on my hit list
Theyve got a new chef, and he totally rocks
Great food
The Beet Goat Cheese Tart was great
The Foie Gras is the best Ive had anywhere in NYC
Had the Cassoulet and couldnt stop eating my friends Short Ribs

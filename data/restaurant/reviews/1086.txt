The space is a curiousity because of the history of the building
It is too noisy to order and you have to yell to carry on any type of conversation at the restaurant
Beware of the prawns, they have the shells on and don't give you any tools to help you eat them
The ribs smell good, but have little taste
The semifreddo is acceptable, but is very very small
The tiramisu gelato is overpowering and the cheesecake gelato has a bad aftertaste
The only think I liked was the banana caramel gelato
I went this past Saturday Night for my birthday
The food, service and ambience were incredible
We arrived 15 minutes late and the hostesses were so accommodating
The lounge downstairs was awesome and the music was great
They played everything from newer music to older music
I would highly recommend this place
I had experienced the worst service of my life! The irritable, rude waiter greeted us and while we were giving him his order he just walked away
He didn't come back to the table for 10 minutes so I went to speak to the manager Jeffery
I requested a new server and he agreed to that
After I sat down the same waiter came back and apologized for walking away and asked us for our order
Everyone at the table felt awkward at that moment because we were content with having another server
We received our drinks and there were chips in the martini glass
We asked for bread 2 times and never recieved it
After having enough we explained the situation to another manager and walked out
I would have had better service at mcdonalds
The experience was horrible
went to take a pizza to go
heard that it was a wood burning oven
real pizza in a wood burning stove takes 3 minutes
1 minute to prepare it
i waited for 15 minutes with only 7 people in the restaurant (i counted with all that spare time i had
) i have had pizza all over this city this is bad pizza at its finest
its ragu on a ritz cracker
yes the space is gorgeous,the people good looking (including me) the hosts (get real) put me on a waiting list to eat
you are so kidding us all
any critic who has put this restaurant in a favorable spotlight deserves criticism
being in this business for most ofr my life i think my understanding of italian food is quite clear
does Steve Hanson taste this stuff
?there are many great italian trattorias in the city to eat
leave this far off your list
If this is what dinning in New York has turned into say WHAT? The food was average; I could have had a better meal at the local pizza place
Although it is new and needs some tweaking, this should be your last choice in the meatpacking district
After dinner we had a table in the lounge, but to our surprise they did not let our entire party in, and we had a list
The location is the most impressive characteristic of this average joint
i must say that b
r
guest let me down on this one
the upstairs dining room resembles a camp mess hall, the acoustics are terrible and the service is slow and unaware of the customers needs
asides from the great location and the lounge downstairs, this restaurant does not have much going for it
if your in the meatpacking district make this your last resort for a meal, go across the street to markt
Well, I have been there twice and I must say that my title says it all
I don't understand the complaints I have been reading, of course there is going to be a time period where kinks are worked out
Give Vento that time
My experiences have consisted of an aesthetically stimulating atmosphere, a friendly staff, YUMMY FOOD (the octopus, pizza, gelato
mmmm), and great original drinks
The location is primo and the fellow patrons all seemed to fall into beat the restaurant innately has
There are very few places you can go where energy flows steadily keeping every patron wide eyed and eager for what's to come
It will be a staple in the meatpacking for years to come
Cheers
After visiting Vento twice for dinner I was very impressed with the food, special cocktails as well as the atmosphere
I even had a major star-sighting- Jesse Palmer from the Bachelor and the Giants ofcourse! Vento can make for a great date place as well as a gathering for friends and family (only if they are worth this hip establishment)
Thank you Steve Hanson for finally bringng real, quality Italian cooking to the Meatpacking
I strongly recommend the pastas esp the gemelli, wood-oven pizzas and the fish entrees were especially fresh as well
I had my favorite cockatil at Vento- The Paradiso
Just writing about it is giving me a craving for it
You can not walk out without sampling the Zeppoles, the authentic Italian dessert well-known at street fairs and Little Italy which tatse superior at Vento
I really can't think of a bad thing to say about Vento
The food was awesome (especially the buffalo mozzerella and pork rack), the drinks were tasty (go with Paradiso), the service was friendly and with it, and the ambience was very cool
It's amazing the transformation the Meatpacking District is going through
I will definitely be back
Vento lives up to it's name, and to it's association with Hanson's empire
The decor is inviting, lively and unique - set in a exposed brick tri-level building
A bustling downstairs gave way to a relaxed upper floor with plenty of windows
The food was terrific - highlights (sharing with my table) were the fresh mozzarella with fantastic pesto, the decadent yet light mushroom and white truffle pizza, the suprisingly refreshing lamb sausage, and the flavorful pistachio gelati
I'd buy it by the quart, if I could!! On the downside, service was rushed at times, but gracious and knowledgeable
All in all - a relaxed place with fun, unpretentious cuisine, and a price that begs for return visits! Bravo!
The menu is chock full of quality options
I'd recommend ordering about 4 of the appetizers and a couple of the pastas and sharing
There's just too much good stuff on the menu not to sample a lot
If you have reservations you'll be seated promptly, otherwise prepare to wait a while or find a spot at the bar
Level V downstairs is even better than the restaurant
Vento is better as a lounge/bar than a restaurant because the place was very loud and happening place
It was very difficult to hear people at your table
The wait (on a Wed pm) for a table, even with a reservation was like waiting behind a velvet rope at a NYC club on a Saturday night
Once seated, it took awhile for the waitstaff to bring the bread and even the menu
The food was fortunately better
I recommend the Octopus as an appetizer and some of the gelati (banana and pistachio)
The cod I had was a bit too seasoned on certain parts and not some much in others
My dining experience with friends started off very badly - 40 minute wait WITH a reservation and having to repeatedly ask for bread and water - but ended on a better note
The hostess did offer free drinks to my party due to the wait, but we were more interested in eating after said long wait
As far as the food is concerned, the appetizers were more creative and more enjoyable than the entrees and there seemed to be a decent variety of desserts
The restaurant itself is in an interesting space, but it was too loud and dark to really enjoy the atmosphere
I would recommend either waiting a few months for all the kinks to be worked out or dining at a more established place in this family of restaurants
The appetizers were exquisite
Everyone at my table agreed that the appetizers were the strongest on the menu
Try the bruschette especially the chicken liver pate
try it and i am sure you'll love it! The service was wonderful
there was no pretentious vibe and the staff was very helpful
The desserts were amazing as well
For entrees, definitely try the pizza! A perfect place to go before a big night out in the Meatpacking!
I absolutely LOVED Vento! The space is amazing - such a cool vibe and great crowd
And the food is incredible!! I highly recommend the pizzas and all of the pastas - you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu
Overall, such a fabulous place

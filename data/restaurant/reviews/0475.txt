, Smith, Suba, Chateau and Industry) Butter is finally the real deal we have all been waiting for
A great scene, fantastic food and friendly service
The street-level non-smoking room offers a breath of fresh air (smoking is allowed downstairs), and the room is gorgeous, with raised ceilings and a huge white stainedglass window providing an ethereal soft-sunlight ambience (even at midnight)
Noone will get away with wearing all-black here
We arrived 30 minutes late, but were seated promptly by a smiling, friendly (and beautiful) hostess
When our food arrived a barely-noticeable 5-minutes late, we were given a free round of drinks and dessert -- such desire to please is unknown in NYC hospitality
Black-olive seared tuna w/ lemon risotto was memorable, I can't find anything to complain about -- even the bathrooms were immaculate
In Short Pink walls and a vaulted sky-blue ceiling overlaid with white art-nouveau designs lend glamour to the Edison Hotel's humbly anachronistic restaurant, which continues to draw hotel guests, Times Square tourists and midtown workers to its many-storied beige booths
Blueberry and banana-walnut pancakes stand out among the bountiful and well-prepared breakfast offerings, while borscht and matzo ball head the list of daily soups
Most welcome of all, the prices stay true to the restaurant's old-time character
I often find myself with time to kill in Times Square, which is a shame since I don't love this area
But if I'm looking for a quick bite before going to a show, I almost always go to Cafe Edison
They have very quick service which is great when you don't have much time
The food is average: breakfast food, soups, salads, sandwiches, etc
It's the conversations that make this a fun place to be
I always find myself sitting next to someone in the theatre industry- interesting to hear ideas hashed out while having a quick bite to eat
The Scene A small, 10-table room with deep red walls and a quaint, pleasant bistro feel
The diners are primarily locals, despite the restaurant's proximity to Bleecker Street's tourist strip
Customers should be prepared to spend a long time over dinner: The small staff is friendly but painfully slow
The Food Expect a host of American-French dishes
Crepes are done well, and sandwiches on Pullman bread--with fillings that include delicious, slightly charred kielbasa, shrimp salad and hanger steak--make a quick and inexpensive alternative to the regular entrees
The chef's concepts are generally good, but ingredients can be sub-par: Both the wan scallops, laid in a tomato broth over a single ribbon of pappardelle, and the dryish rib lamb chops in a tasty tomato confit with green fava beans are disappointing
For a lighter meal, there are several variations on the goat cheese salad theme
Shabby rather then cozy
The food was barely ok
Salad was way overdressed
Halibut was dry and rubbery with an overwhelming sauce
Hanger steak was dry and drowning in  sauce
Creme brulee was a failure
The dessert crepe, banana and chocolate was great
I would only go back for crepes
The waiter, Earnest, was very nice
Camaje is close by to my apartment, and in spite of its rough edges, one of my favorite places to go
The food is reasonably priced, and almost always good
The atmosphere and clientele often evoke the feeling of being at a friend's dinner party, where people linger over wine, and chat over small plates of food
The downside, is that the service is terribly slow, and you can expect to wait a long time for your order to be taken, your food to arrive, and your bill to come
I only go when I have a few hours to kill
I went here not sure what to expect because of mixed reviews
The food was very good, the service was kind but a little slow
To accomodate my table forgetting a glass of wine I ordered, they gave it to me for free along with a free one for my fiancee
I would definitely recommend this place, it can be a little pricey, but not bad for NYC and the food and atmoshpere is worth it
I love the food here
They never rush you
The prices are great, too
My wife took a cooking class with the chef and said it was amazing!
Great food and service
Reasonable prices a GREAT VALUE OVERALL
I would recomend their FANTASTIC onion soup
Luis Massieu
Food was so good! The salmon was a bit salty, but overall excellent food
Ambience is definitely a cozy, laid back atmosphere (not romantic), fantastic choice for a lazy Sunday meal
Scallops were incredible (I generally do not eat scallops), pumpkin soup delicious, onion soup yummy, banana/chocolate crepes had too much chocolate but everything was good
Service was slow and nice but they can be nicer
I would come back again
Prix fixe is a good buy
Saw the mixed reviews and still decided to try CamaJe out
No regrets
Friendly service, romantic ambience and excellent food(roasted hangar steak, crispy duck, salad with goat cheese, fantastic desserts)
Will definitely come back!
a nice cozy place with friendly service (even though not the most professional one)
went there on a Tuesday night
Were seated immediately
The soups (seafood and vegeterian) were excellent
Salad was really good
and the Panini sandwich was ok
good selection of wines
around $50 not including tip for 2 soups one salad and one sandwich and 2 glasses of wine
We had dinner at Camaje last night and it was wonderful! Our reservation was for 7:30 and by 8 it was packed
Service was attentive and friendly, we didn't have to wait for anything! The prixe fix was a great deal
any three courses for 25 bucks and the food was outstanding
Portions were perfectly sized and we left feeling full but not stuffed
The menu had so many choices it took us 20 minutes to decide because everything sounded tempting
The wine list was excellent for such a small place and the bottle prices were exceptionally reasonable
Desserts were delicious
chocolate souffle was one of the best I've had
We had dessert on a comfy couch and watched the people walking by
It was so nice to chat with the owner/chef on our way out
We complimented her style and will definitely be back again for dinner and a cooking class!
Too many other fun, small places in the Village
Food was decent, but not great
Service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night
Most laughable moment of night was when waiter offered me a free drink to make up for th 50 minute appetizer wait
When I motioned the whole table would partake in the round, he sheepishly replied that he couldn't get a free drink for everyone - just me
The place just isn't ready for prime time
I found Camaje to be very accomodating and the staff very friendly
The atmosphere is rather cozy and although the place was busy, our service was rather quick
The food wasn't the best I've had, but very tasty nonetheless
My wife I went for Brunch and were both very happy with our meals
The food was tasty
The service was very good and the ambiance was very cozy
We recommend it!
A few co-workers and I went to Camaje on a Tuesday night based on the 9
4 rating on CitySearch
The restaurant was empty, except for a handful of people there for a cooking class
we remained the only people there eating our mediocre food amidst the sound of whisks against the side of bowls coming from the class
Did I mention, the class was being held right in the main dining area as we ate? Hanger steak was rubbery, ribs were cold, potatoes undercooked, and the desserts below average
The icing on the cake was the 18% gratuity that was automatically added to our bill, though we were a party of 4, and not 6 as the menu states
Plenty of other French bistros in Manhattan
don't waste your time here
I chose CamaJe to go to for Valentine's Day after reading mixed reviews and I called 3 weeks before Valentine's Day to make reservations

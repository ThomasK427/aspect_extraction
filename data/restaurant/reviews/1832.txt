The service was perhaps the most unfriendly I have had in a while and the decor was nothing out of the ordinary
Overall, I'd have to pass on it next time around
While shopping in SoHo in the freezing weather (don't ask why) I was more than delighted to discover deliciously hot noodles in this downtown noodle shop
The ambiance lend itself similar to that of noodle shops in Asian, rustic but cute
I thoroughly enjoyed the noodles and hot tea
It is refreshing to discover Asian cusine in the heart of Soho
I went to Kelley and Ping on the suggestion of a friend and boy was I in for a treat
Not only was the food absolutely delicious and the staff friendly and warming I received a WONDERFUL chinese New Year GIFT; a RED ENVELOPE!! Apparently, to all their customers they were handing out vouchers for free cocktails!! TO EVERYONE
That's crazy and wonderful
for me
These incredibly chic gift cards are wonderful
I just recently received a gift card from Kelley and Ping
( I like to open my presents early
) It is not a repugnant Duane Reade blue that you try to hide in the back of your wallet
You can actually put it out there without being embaressed, I know I do
I dunno it makes me feel kind of special all inside
=) And the fact that I can use these cards in the near future to build up a free meal doesn't hurt either
Yah!
This low-key gem is a real authentic treat for those looking for tantilizing courses and with a romantic ambience
Only been there once, but I surely plan to go back
The Pad Thai was amazing, the portions were big, and the service is pretty good
Kelley and Ping is one of my favorite restaurants because of the wonderful soups and noodles, the courteous service, and overall hip atmosphere
Every time I get the same food (malaysian curry noodles, pad thai, and the big plate to start) and every time I savor every bite
Everyone should check this place out!
I've been to many asian eateries but this one was pretty pathetic
Why pay $13 for stir-fry noodles when u can get them for half price and tastier at Chinatown? Everything was overly salty and the pork chops were so tough, we had to work our jaw real hard
Forget this place and go to Saigon Grill
Never been for dinner or drinks, but KP's lunches are perfect for fast food without the usual yuck
The Scene The two-story restaurant feels like a cleanly designed but comfortable home, with fireplaces in every room, whimsical touches here and there, and a general air of accommodation and comfort
Service shows the same welcoming, competent style, with effortless and unobtrusive skill
The Food The frequently changing menu brilliantly highlights what's in season
Perfectly composed dishes, like organic pork loin sliced over al-dente black beans, housemade kimchi and grilled ramps, are innovative as well as worthy showcases for the exquisite ingredients
Roasted halibut harmonizes with Jerusalem artichokes and garlic custard, while rare grilled tuna peeks out of a Yemenite-spiced "spring broth" with remarkably tender baby vegetables
Rich, savory beet soup needs no cream; instead, a tender hunk of pickled shad adds depth and contrast
Desserts, including housemade ice creams, are also exceptional: A coconut panna cotta's unearthly delicacy is set off by pungent but refined Meyer lemon confit
This is the third time i've been to savoy and i'll start with what its not - not a true date place, not a place for hipsters, not a cheap'n'cheerful spot
Oh but what it is
delicious food
Sparkling ingredients
Top wines (the lower priced wines are lovely and decent value
the upper are out of your bracket but go find someone with an expense account
) This restaurant manages to comfortably tread that thin line between east village foodie (hearth, prune) and big soho institution (balthazar, raouls)
To be fair, you are paying for it - but its money well spent
I took mom and the family to Savoy for Mother's Day
by accident
(We had reservations for another restaurant and just came for some wine
) We were seated at an intimate corner table on the second floor which differs greatly from the hustle and bustle of the first floor
The wait staff was very attentive and served us some excellent wines and appetizers
We canceled our other reservations and stayed there
We did not know American Cuisine could be so delicious
The unpretentious yet cozy ambience is reminiscent of the types of restaurants you would perhaps find in New England
This is truly one of the few hidden gems to be found in New York City
Savoy is a rather exquisite establishment with an eclectic drink selection and a distinctive food offering
The staff was extremely helpful and accessible
The only drawback is that when I and my date started getting a bit romantic (nothing over the top, mind you), our waiter made an obnoxious comment about it to the bartender
Otherwise, a very nice place and gets my recommendation despite my usual nitpickiness
After reading the reviews here, I decided to try
Made 830pm reservations on a Saturday night that morning
Showed up on time, sat us immediately
Service was very friendly, just a bit too slow
not a bad thing, gave us time to talk over/after dinner
The steak (flatiron I think) was very good, cooked perfect to order
I wouldn't call it too romantic, but very nice
Two entrees (around 28 each), one glass of wine, one coke, and one double expresso was approx
$80
You decide if a NY value or not
I personally thought I'd break the 100 mark, happy not to
I had lunch at Savoy last week and sat near Kate Winslet! The food was excellent and the service professional, despite a very full dining room
I thought the value was good, considering the neighborhood
Savoy's been in Soho for 15 years, so they must be doing something right! I will go back very soon
Maybe it was because of all the hoopla that Savoy is one of the most romantic restaurants that my expectations in this direction were not met at all
Overall, this is a nice place with good but overpriced food - but nothing too exiting
Despite reservation we had to wait and the promising question about the name of the birthday person obviously had no specific intention as well as the question for an extra nice table
Savoy is a gem of a place
Delicious, creative, FRESH food that is well prepared and served
Servers are wonderful
Helpful and attentive without being obtrusive
The setting is cozy and intimate and everybody who works there is so helpful and friendly
Bartender is generous with the wine tastings
A wonderful place a nice night out to treat yourself as it is a bit spendy
Overall, a truly delightful experience
Overall I felt Savoy was just another average place
There was nothing really special about it, or anything to make it stand out in my mind
Food wasn't bad and service was ok
For desert we had the Creme Brule, I dont recommend it
Would I return? Maybe as a last resort or out of boredom
Visited Savoy w/ my boyfriend on a Saturday
We arrived at 8:00 for our 8:45 reservation
We let the very kind hostess know we were there and had some drinks at the bar
We were sat at 9:05 for our 8:45 reservation
We didn't have a problem with that, but we were annoyed when another couple came in at 8:55 and were seated immediately
We asked the host, who was very snooty, and he told us that the other couple had an 8:30 reservation
I believe it would have been good business if we were sat before the other couple, since they were 30 minutes late for their reservation
That incident set the mood for the night
We ate our meal quickly and left, which was delicious, but for the price, the portions were small
Service: nothing spectacular; we received warm water, but that was the only problem we encountered
I like dining here
Just one of those nice and easy place where you can get great food and service and no attitude
And nice selection of wines
This place is out of this world

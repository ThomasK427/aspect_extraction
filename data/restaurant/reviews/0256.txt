best cannoli in ny! also a great wine selection
I recently held my friend's bridal shower here for 10 people and they made us feel right at home - from letting me in before they even opened for dinner to decorate to letting us enjoy the meal for over three hours! Would definitely recommend for small groups or dates - thanks again Freddy!
not fancy about this place,just simple straight forward home cooked italian meals served with love and care
artichokes are wonderful, the veal chops are too big to finish

and dessert
try to find a better cannoli
I am frankly stunned to see so many good reviews of La Cantina
I went there on Saturday and will NEVER go back
It is a lovely space, romantic and warm
BUT the food was only average, and truly overpriced
I could handle the menu being on a blackboard (that's charming) if they would show me the prices
They put together a family style appetizer for 4 people and I cannot believe how much it set us back
And the entree was really blah
If you don't care what you get for your money, this is the place for you!
First of all, you don't get a menu, so you have no idea what anything costs
Whatever you do, do not let them choose their family-style appetizers for you
7/8 of the dishes had the same tomato sauce
The lamb chops weren't adequately spiced and overdone
The broccoli rabe was bitter (don't you salt it to remove the bitterness
The monk fish was drowning in sauce - the same tomato sauce
And I'm not convinced the ravioli pasta was fresh
$70 later
This place is fantastic
it's everything a resturant ought to be
Great food, nice ambiance, and fantastic service
Freddie goes out of his way to make sure the experience is top-notch
I've been here a number of times and just recently brought some friends from the WestCoast
they loved it! Apparently, personalized resturant service is not something that get too much of in lala land
Freddie threw in a couple of authentic fagettaboutit's, as well as, a round of gasoline (grappas) to finish off the night
I have eaten at La Cantina twice this week
I was so pleasantly surprised when I ate there the first time that I only waited one day before I returned for a second amazing meal
From beginning to end, the service, the warm romantic setting and especially the food was breathtaking
The value is also great for the level of gourmet Italian cooking
I must add that the Cannoli I had for dessert was the best Cannoli I have ever had ( believe me, I have had my fair share!!)
Truly, from beginning to end, both times I ate at La Cantina was a pleasure for all senses
this italian gem is a well kept secret
offering outstanding food, great service, and a comfortable ambiance; i rate my experience at la cantina a 10 all the way
we were all wowed by our dishes and the attentive, friendly service
i'll be back soon!
we love this place,foods great,freddy makes you feel at home,order off the menu,or let them decide what to eat,great wine list,lotsa sicilian wines,big surprise
yeh,the place is small
but thats the charm,try the pastas,the chops,then the cannoli,filled to order
we will return here many times over
La Cantina is one of those rare finds in New York City
From the romantic ambiance, to the time and dedicaiton taken to prepare each flavorful dish, the experience of dinig here was nothing less than perfect
Owner Fred Sammarone has definitely created a tasteful combination of old world cuisine and classic New York City Charm to create a perfectly wondeful establishment
Everything is fresh at La Cantina, from the staff (gracious and professional) to the tasty treats (set out right away to activate or enhance your appetite) to the vibrant pasta sauces and well-rounded meals
I always overeat because it's all just too good to go to waste
La Cantina never disappoints, rather it always pleases
VERY FEW PLACES CAN KEEP UP WITH THE FOOD AT LA CANTINA,FREDDY,A WONDERFUL MAN,VERY ATTRACTIVE TOO ADD
RUNS HIS RESTAURANT WITH SUCH GRACE,THE PLACE MAY BE SMALL,BUT THE FOOD IS AS CLOSE TO AUTHENTIC ITALIAN COOKING AS YOU WILL FIND ANYWHERE IN THE CITY,GREAT WINES ESPECIALLY FROM SICILY,LAMB OSSOBUCO,A RED SAUCE THAT ROCKS YOUR TASTE BUDS
BEST CANNOLI IN THE CITY
A REAL GEM IN THE WEST VILLIAGE,BOOK WELL IN ADVANCE DUE TO THE 12 TABLES THAT ARE TO BE HAD
The owner, Freddie, oozes with charm! George the bartender is also quite pleasant
The rest of the staff makes one feel welcome in this pleasant and romantic restaurant
The care with which the meal and the service is presented makes me want to visit every night!  I thoroughly enjoyed the freshest of everything beginning with the appetizers and continuing with the entree
Best of all, Freddie played a Seal CD--one of my favorites! I hate to recommend this place because I want to keep this little secret to myself; but it's the holiday and I'm feeling generous!
The Scene White linens, exposed brick and billowy curtains create a quiet tranquility inside this tidy, perfectly appointed space
Service could not be better--it's expertly unobtrusive, yet just engaging enough
Diners are well-dressed and many enjoy the restaurant with an ease that results from many regular visits
The Food Classic haute French that is beautifully presented and simply lovely to eat
Soft goat cheese-filled ravioli arrive placed upon a shockingly crimson beet-mustard sauce, punctuated with ink-black caviar
Halibut, surrounded by a lovely late-spring jumble of peas, ramps, fava beans and radishes, captures the season nicely
The thick square of veal confit couldn't be more tender and rich
The terrine, with foie gras and short ribs, is a nice break from the usual over-the-top richness of a foie terrine, yet a bit too rugged on the palate
Desserts are understated and wonderful
Nice atmosphere and space, but everything else about this place was decidedly mediocre
The staff was not very friendly and the service was decent but certainly not exceptional in any way
The food was generally overcooked and uninspired
The mark up on the wine was outrageously high, even by New York standards
Would not recommend this restaurant
I come here 2-3x's per year, always a wonderful affair, food/presentation superb, excellent friendly accommodating svc
love the foie gras, the lamb was tasty
desserts a sin
pricey but should expect excellent french to be so
take a train/cab it, parking is not good
The SUM IT: a must try
better than a lot of french spots, nice evening to be had
foie gras! I'm in heaven!
If you eat french, expect to pay for the cuisine
But you should also expect great food, wine service
with ambiance this is my favorite
My girlfriend took me here for my b/day, it was a wonderful warming romantic evening
Came again for mother-n-law bday, still the service was par excellence
Very attentive polite informative
The foie gras (my test for french) was excellent (tho ny grown)
The lamb was exquisitedly prepared
The desserts heavenly
Not being wine drinkers, this was ok - we prefer red vs
the whites
Overall, this place much preferred in an area not surrounded by busy busy traffic of other restaurants tourists
Parking sucks tho
Don't sit near the door or get a winter blast every time the door is open
I chose Fleur de Sel for our 1-year anniversary dinner based on the recommendations on this site
What a disappointment! Of the 2 appetizers, the suckling pig terrine was ordinary at best and the lobster was drowning in some kind of mayonnaise dressing
Both portions were tiny
For the main course, the Hake (fish) was rather bland, although my veal was superbly prepared
However, both portions were miniscule
After dropping $250 for dinner I was still hungry

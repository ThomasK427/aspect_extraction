I would say my neighborhood Thai is cheaper and better than TOC
Friendly service, reasonable price, but not authentic food
Esp in LES, you can get better food down the block
The staff were friendly and attentive, but I didn't think the food was exceptional, and all the dishes we ordered tasted a little too sweet even for Thai dishes
cute-place, but food is the most mediocre take on Thai food I've had in New York
Maybe it was a bad night, but no way am I going back
The bland flavors at prices $1-3 higher than other more tasty thai eateries nearby (in the east village, I don't think there are other thai places in the LES) make the experience at TOC an expensive disappointment
The pad thai, which I consider the mark of a decent thai joint, is lacking in multidimentionaly which is revealing for a dish with so many ingredients
The one thing going for it is the fast delivery
Returning to visit New York for the weekend all the way from Maryland, my NY resident friends took my husband and I to TOC, as they insisted it had the best spring rolls in the entire city
Not only were the spring rolls the best, I practically licked the plate of my Tamarind Duck, the special of the evening
The service was kind, efficient, and unobtrusive - the atmosphere friendly and casual
The presentation of the food would make one think that the prices are double what they actually are
All in all, and amazing meal and evening
The only thing I could really say bad about Thai on Clinton was their reliance on an annoying acroynm as the name of the restaurant - TOC
Otherwise, the overall experience was excellent
Simple Thai food
For a good value -dishes were cheap and you can bring your own beer or a wine
Service was good and the space is nice
Clinton street is really turning into one of the best for good bars and restaurants - lot of fun
How much does a 3 bedroom cost there?
This small, quiet restaurant is a diamond in the rough
I have gone out of my way to go back again and again
The food is refreshingly above average
not your typical Thai takeout
The ingredients are fresh, the preparation well thought and the presentation simple
The service is attentive and unassuming; they don't miss a beat
The ambience is is as fresh as the food
clean lines and soft lighting, with tasteful background music that allows for conversation
All in good taste
to a T!
great Food, great Service on Clinton
Definitely recommended for all Thai food lover
Remember to check out the lime green bathroom
After seeing the Chicago matinee yesterday, we took my daughter and her friend for an early dinner
We arrived 30 minutes earlier than our reservation but were seated promptly without a fuss
The service was prompt and efficient-the food wonderful
Om your first trip to Federico's-try ordering off the Early Bird Menu
The $22
95 Pre Fix dinners are to die for ! See if you can get a window table overlooking 50th Street!
My dining experience at this restaurant was wonderful
The food and service was first class! Exquisite taste, quite large portions
Very reasonable prices for such a romantic setting, my wife and I loved it! Great location for before or after a show
I would definitely recommend it
The food was absolutely amazing, the tomato sauce was to die for we went to federicos on a fri night after a show Frank the manger was so nice and such a help so if you go ask for Frank
Our dining experience at Fredericos was definetly one of our best
My fiance and I went there after he proposed to me in times square, it was absoutely ROMANTIC
In my opinion the best Italian food I have had in NYC in a long time
The staff is remarkable, the food is breath taking, the atmosphere delightful, the matinis- awwsome and mouth watering baked clams
Definately deserves a second
Highly recommended !!!  '
The food was good, not heavy with the olive oil at all
The atmosphere was pleasant
The only downfall is the food was brought out too quickly, one course on top of the other
We arrived at 5:30PM, received our antipasti and main course so quickly, we were finished with the meal by 6:15PM
I got the feeling the food was prepared ahead of time because it didn't come out hot
My preference is a long dinner and this definitely was not
My husband said it took longer to get the check
Very reasonable prices
Remarkably fresh food, especially seafood, for a hotel restaurant
However, the restaurant rarely seems to change its menu which is boring if you're staying at the hotel
The staff also have the sort of weary, dullnes that comes from years of hotel service
Romantic view of the WTC PATH station, particularly when the crowds are heading home on a cold day
In Short Boasting a sleek decor of blond wood, raw steel and exposed pipes, this taqueria hums with conversation and an eclectic mix of piped-in salsa, rock and reggae
Patrons--mostly on-the-go professionals and parents with kids in tow--line up at an assembly-line style counter for hard and soft tacos or burritos (regular, fajita-style or without the tortilla) made with fillings like grilled chicken or steak, free-range pork or shredded beef
I go to lunch here a number of times
When I first went, there was a REALLY long line that went out the door, and by the looks of that, it was discouraging to even want to try it
However, I heard great things about it; so, I gave it a shot
I was surprised how fast the line went! They make them really fast, and the wait doesn't feel long at all
The food is GREAT, and I love how you can pick and choose what you want in your burrito/fajita/bol/tacos
My favorite is their chicken fajita, and I'm addicted to their salsas! Not to mention, their burritos/fajitas are HUGE!! It's such a great value!
Love it, can't say enough! Was soo excited when it came to the East Coast because we deserve great fast food mexican too!
I have never seen a burrito stuff so much
You go thru three people that builds the burrito the way you want it (meats, beans, veg
)---mines was spicy and really good---i couldn't finish the entire thing
This place serves one of the best burrito in NYC
I first ate Chipotle in Denver about 6 years ago and was so excited to see one in the city
If I am craving a burrito, this is hands down the only place I go, the chicken is wonderful
Ambience is sort of fast foodish but if you're after quick, great food this is the place
They are so big that I often make two meals out of it
Come from the colorado area where Chipotle originated
Couldn't get enough there and can't get enough here!
Near restaurant quality food at fast food prices
The service isn't always great, but then again this is a fast food establishment
You have no idea what everyone is talking about it until you go
Without a doubt best chicken burrito in the city, if not ever, the burrito bowl is also a great alternative
I just wish this place had stock
Chipotle is hands-down the best Mexican in this city
The food is fresh, the meat is high-quality and they know the secret to amazing guacamole (the test of any true Mexican place)
Puts places like Burritoville to shame!
While the line is out the door at lunchtime, that is no excuse for the staff to be rude, and skimp on the servings
You can also pre-order by fax, but expect to wait when you get there
Our order took a total of 60 min - because they hadn't 'gotten to them yet'
My advice: show up before the lunch rush and try the tacos - you won't need a siesta afterwards!
I first tried this in Denver, CO a few years ago
I just tried their new East Village location near Astor Place
It is your best bet for cheap eats and good value
You can't possibly not be full once finishing one of these burritios! Good for lunch or dinner! Easy on the wallet and your palate!
Chipotle just does something special with their food, somehow all the parts just add up to create more then their sum
In particular I think there is something magical about the cilantro/lemon rice they use

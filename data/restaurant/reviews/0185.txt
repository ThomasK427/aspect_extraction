when Douglas was there I was there
now its not even worth going
the food has become mediocre and the service has lost its touch also
Went there on a Friday night and was surprised that party's of two were sat at communal tables
Also, quite noisy in the restaurant and difficult to hear other person speak unless you mind shouting at one another
I did like the chandeliers and the ambience of the restaurant
The food was okay
a little pricey for the small portion size of some of the tapas
We sat at the bar because the restaurant wasn't open for dinner
The bartender recommended plates and every one was delicious
It was one of the best meals we have ever had
The shrimp was amazing
The bacon wrapped dates were unbelievable! We highly recommend this restaurant to all of our friends
There was a mix of couples and small groups of friends
It is great for any size group
arriving on saturday night, we found the dining room filled
within minutes, the professional hostess had secured seating for us, which much to our disappointment, was in a communal table
luckily, we averted disaster by requesting an available deuce by the rear exit, overlooking construction
straining to read the menu under the low-lighting-tag-sale-chandelier motif, we were able to order a salad, tapas, and entrees from the first of several waiters, none of whom were able to introduce themselves, recommend dishes, present silverware, remove plates, or deliver water when asked
after retrieving silverware ourselves, we found all the dishes to be delicious, including the salad, which arrived after entrees were served
left alone after finishing the scrumptious dulce de leche cake, we enjoyed the romantic nature of pipa, not so much from the lighting, but from the negligence of the waitstaff who would never return to bring change from the check
Went here with some co-workers because i was craving Sangria
We had reservations and they seated us by the door (brrr!) No problem moving us to a better table
I recommend the sparkling sangria and the Pineapple Coconut Mojitos!! We started off with tapas, which were amazing (chorizo, calamari, scallops and spinach)
Everything was delicious
We were full from the tapas but the steak and paella were on the way
AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS
was full but couldn't stop eating
It is a little expensive though
Going back there tonight with my boyfriend
can't wait!
I actually created an account on Citysearch, so I could write this review of Pipa
Unfortunately, I don't have good things to say about this place
If you have a large party - go somewhere else as the management and staff are not accommadating
They seemed hostile
I organized a birthday party for a friend and the service was sporadic, the tapas and cocktails were unremarkable
We asked for the music to be turned down a little, because we were literally screaming across the tables to be heard
The server just smirked at me and walked away
Perhaps, he couldn't hear me over the blaring music
The server also over-charged us for pitchers of sangria that no one ordered? All 20 party guests agreed that Pipa is grossly lacking as a high end restaurant and will strongly urge friends not to patron Pipa
It was incredibly disappointing and extremely expensive
What a terrific experience! My first visit to Pipa was excellent all around: from the very pleasant hostesses who greeted us at the door, to the delicious Sangria, appetizers and desserts (Dulce de Leche-my favorite highly recommended), great music, to the extremely friendly Maitre D' that came over to our table to check on our experience
We had at least 10 of the appetizers on the menu, which all were delicious
Must try the Dates!!! Everything was way beyond our expectations and well within what we were expecting to pay
I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND PIPA and I will be back to visit very soon
After waiting 15 minutes with a reservation, they tried to seat my wife and I at a communal table
Completely unacceptable that a restaurant this expensive would think that it is acceptable to put couples together at communal tables
They told us that ALL TABLES FOR TWO ARE AT THE COMMUNAL TABLES
They assume that everyone knows that which is why they don't tell you on the phone
walked in on a busy thursday evening and was seated immediately without reservations
started with drinks then went to tapas
both were excellent
atmosphere was above average with everyone looking like they were having a great time
i don't understand why they keep the music so loud
it makes it difficult to hear and you have to pretty much shout across the table for your date to hear which makes it a little uncomfortable
overall it was a good time and i will return
food is excellent! but had enough of pipa
everytime i go there with reservations, i end up waiting for 30 minutes or more
last time it went, the music was so loud, i was screaming across the table
i'll find good tapas somewhere else
Have been here a zillion times
Some times was great, sometimes was mediocre
They defintely have their on and off times, but tapas are always on cue- GREAT! Had one episode when the Sangria was watered down
Once I alerted my waiter, he did not have a problem to change it
Since I regularly visit Pipa, I know how the Sangria is supposed to taste
Love the eclectic feel of the dining room
Always recommend this place for a great time!
To those people who complain about the service and the small servings - 1) sitting and lingering over your dinner is a luxury - the thing that makes Pipa so great is that they understand this - they never rush you, 2) small plates = tapas, 3) the tapas portions here are about three times the size as other tapas restaurants for the same price
If you don't get the premise of tapas go somewhere else
WOW! What a spectacular place! THIS PLACE IS THE SPOT! the tapas are just perfect,and the SANGRIA is the best I've had in the city
The bar is great,we had so much Sangria and food my mouth waters just thinking of my next glass,and can't forget the the bartenders they were great! What a great smile
I Highly reccomend this latino experience
We had made reservations, with our credit card, for a group of 10 on a Friday night
When our table was set it was given to another person with the same name that DID NOT reserve with a credit card
The hostess was not helpful at all and did not beleive that, right in our faces, she had given the table to another group
The manager promised to ask the group to leave but never did, she was even rude to us
Finally, a table was available, 1 hr
after our reservation time
After eating, and drinking the worst sangria ever, we practically had to beg the waiter for our bill
Food was OK but service will definitely keep me from going back
The ambiance is really wonderful but I don't recommend sitting too close to the store or you feel like you're in a mall restaurant
I read other reviews and thought the tapas dishes were going to be so small, so I ordered a bunch and they ended up being huge and I couldn't finish them
They were delicious! The sangria was great and I would recommend this place to anyone
but beware of the how loud the place can get
If you're looking for quiet I would find someplace else
There's not a better setting in NYC for a great date
The ambience here can't be topped, the lighting is dark, making it very cool
The whole plethora of chandelliers adds a great touch
Now only if they'd close the door to ABC carpets in the back this place would be it, the light coming in and the shoppers peering into the restaurants is very odd
The tapas is top-notch, the choices are plenty
but make sure to get the paella
It's a bit greasy or buttery but I guess that's part of it
You will leave very stuffed, if not over-stuffed
It's a bit on the pricey side, but when you weigh all the variables
well worth it
Boy howdy, some slow service
The place was nearly empty at lunchtime, yet no one took our order for 15 minutes, and then another table was seated, ordered, served, and was halfway through their meal before our food arrived
And then, problem #2: the microscopic tapas
This was my friend's doom, not mine--she got a cup of soup and an appetizer as her lunch rather than an entree, as she often does
The $7 mushroom croquettes consisted of three tiny fried balls the size of my thumb

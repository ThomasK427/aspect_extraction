Its certainly not a cheap eats place but its averagely-priced for a NYC restaurant
The restaurant is cozy and inviting, and the live music on certain nights adds more vibrance
For a party of 20, the staff was friendly but had a little bit of difficulty keeping the orders straight
The menu has some flavorful alternatives, but those dining with vegetarians beware - there's not much to offer
The El Tropical salad is a light and different start, and the empanadas have some great combinations as well
The camarones y arroz amarillo got a thumbs up, as did the salmon varadero, but don't forget to add some maduros (sweet plantains) to any meal
No matter what you have, be prepared with something minty for your breath, as garlic is a staple in most dishes!
Great food, comfortable atmosphere
Have been here a few times w/ friends, they did a total redesign and now offer more seating and it great for afterwork for Tapa's and cocktails! Highly recommened! Enjoyed great food and service
Have been to Agozar several times now and have been meaning to write a review
The place has really hit its stride with excellent food, accomodating servers and very gracious owners
My personal favorites are the empanadas, ceviche and ropa vieja - oh and I can't forget the specialty drinks - especially the caparinhis
It was also nice to see that they have opened up even more space for dining by reconfiguring the bar area
I'm looking foward to going back soon for another great meal
the tapas are great
the drinks are on the money
try the mojitos
great atmosphere
took my fiance for Valentines Day
very romantic
the bar's cool
I LOVE THIS PLACE!
I dont know where that last poster ate, but it wasnt this place
A group of us got together and thought we were stopping into a little place we could take over
Wrong! Guess we were there before the crowds arrived, because the place exploded about an hour into our meal
We allowed the waitress to handle a lot of the ordering since we were such a big group, and she did great
The ham croquetes, empanada trio and marinated shrimp appies went over big
So did the paella and pork loin
But everything was excellent, including the drinks; and the bartender, when we migrated up to the bar after dinner
We had several Latins in our group, who were all enjoying the food, so it wasn't just us gringos
We were stuffed and laughed all night
I came here for drinks with my friends and had a great time
It was very accomodating for large groups and the drinks were fantastic
Especially the white sangria special, YUM
The food was great and just the right amount for their reasonable prices
I'm definitely looking forward to going back and next time with even more friends
I took my best friend out for her birthday dinner and thank goodness she enjoyed her entree because the rest of the food was disgusting
The sangrias were water downed, the Yuca Frites was dry, and very dry, shrimp appetizer was not fresh, the croquetas was -- WHAT was it?? The pollo con rizo was bland and dry, the special of the day (shrimp paella) was soooooo hot that I could not eat it after 2 bites and I love spicy foods
Chocolate dessert was crummy (pun intended-- how can a brownie be dry and crumbles???)
Sigh
And above all the place had no ventiliation and extremely, extremely loud
Good thing this is not the first time I had cuban food beause this experience would have ruined it for me
I would not go back there again
The only thing good about this place is the service was very accomdating
I came here for a few birthday drinks with my friends and had an awesome time
It is quite a cozy place so I wouldn't suggest it for large groups, but the drinks were fantastic, especially the apple-martini
The food was great, could've been bigger portions, but it was just the right size if you're out drinking
Looking forward to going back for another apple-martini!!
I chose Agozar on a whim from this site, and it really exceeded my expectations
The atmosphere was great - low lighting, a live band with a female singer crooning smooth bossanova music, and seating that was cozy but didn't have you plastered up against your neighbor
And the food!! The chorizo was the best I've had - and having lived in Argentina, Spain, and Mexico, that's saying a lot
And the Ropa Vieja was delicious
My boyfriend had the Picadillo Empanada and the grilled pork and he was equally satisfied
And the drink menu is great - we tried all four flavors of the Mojito, as well as the Caipirinha, and all were delicious
I highly recommend this place, both for dates and for groups
I can't wait to go back!
2 for 1 drinks make each Corona $2
50, that's a great price for a great beer in the City
Also the happy hour early bird dinner from 5pm - 7pm was OUTSTANDING
You get a lot of food (3 courses) for the $12
50 and it can be easily shared between two people
The food, is exquisite hispanic food not just cuban
The Ceviche was tasty and the quesaddilas were better than some I've tasted in Mexican restaurants
It's pricey so I would recommend it during the happy hour! However, the food is definitly worth the price any other time
Came for drinks after work to enjoy the Mojitos and took advantage of the Happy Hour specials and Cuban Cuisine
The rellenos and salmon were especially tasty
This place was lively and fun and the staff was extremely helpful
I would definitely recommend this place to my friends
Sorry, this place is definitely not a crowd pleaser
It's too small for large groups and no elbow room
Drinks are not tasty and food is not original
The prices are poorly reflected and the value is just plain bad
Only thing I can say is that it's dark enough place to take a date that's an eyesore because you can't even read the menu cause it's so dark!!!
Food is excellent
Mojitos are one of the best i've had
small bar area has big friendly attitude and attentive service
Dishes were all tasty
Some a bit small but worth it
All dishes added up to a bigger bill than expected but worth the treat
i was really sad reading any negative reviews of this place
my friend and I went here last friday and we loved everything about it
the bartender was great; the sangria was terrific
They played great spanish music all night
Our waitress was super sweet and the food was amazing
The rice and beans were really tasty, and the chicken skewers were delicious
Our waitress recommended the coffee flan for dessert, and we didn't regret it
We left happily stuffed and somewhat tipsy, and anxious for our next visit
I'd come back here every week if i could!
Though they were slammed with a crowd from the Tribeca Film Festival and our food took forever to arrive, it was so delicious and the servers were incredibly apologetic and nice
They comped our entire meal! The garlic shrimp, shrimp and chorizo with white wine, lemon and butter sauce and saffron rice, churrasco steak, avocado salad and coconut crusted grouper were all amazing
Even though we started out a little mad, we left all smiles - and a huge tip for the servers!
My friends and I met up for a few drinks and what was suppose to be a short night ended up being all night
This place was great
their mojitos were the best I'd ever had and the food was delicious! especially their empanadas
They also had a live band that was amazing
I highly recommend it to everyone!
My friends and I arranged for a bachelorette party here
After they tried to change the contract last-minute, we were crammed into this tiny corner amidst the kitchen traffic
The food was so-so but the service was awful
It took 20 minutes to get a drink, if they remembered at all

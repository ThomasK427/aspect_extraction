The food is delicious and reasonably priced, and the waitstaff has always been friendly and professional with us
I know we'll be back! Definitely recommended
I came here on a Saturday night for my birthday
We had reservations and called to say we would be late they said it was fine
When we arrived we were told by the rudest manager ever that we could not be seated for another 2 hrs
Finally we got seated in 20 min
Our table had be sitting empty for the entire time
As if the rudeness of the manager was not enough the waiter we had was his equal
One of my friends came late ordered an entre the waiter told her it would take 20min
After 20 min
we wondered where her food was
The rude waiter told us the manager wouldn't allow her to eat because she would be holding the table up, but that she could eat by herself at another table
I experienced nothing but attitude all night
I have been here several times and Im always impressed with the quality of the food and how delicious it is
Services is great and they often have live music
Very personable experience and very reasonable prices for such quality food
Fun atmosphere as well
Not much room for large groups but a tabel of six is fine
I met some friends here for dinner on a Friday night, and there was a line out the door! I definitely recommend making reservations
The atmosphere was great - they really capture the mood, colors, and textures of Latin America
The food was above average
We started with the tapas plate, and I found the Spanish tortilla, ceviche and chorizo to be excellent
I ordered a mojito, which was a bit strong, and we also had a nice syrah, which I recommend
All in all, a positive experience!
Walking back towards 1st Ave after the dinner, I couldn't help but feel like I was returning from another latitude
Warm colorful, lively atmosphere, pulse-pounding live music, sweet caiparinhas and food to rival any I've had in S
America
We had an extremely busy but cutely attentive hispanic server
When I started ordering an appetizer, she nearly jumped with excitement until she realized I was ordering something else, I asked her what it was she thought I ordered, and when she told me I switched to that (the crabcake with plantain chips) and didn't regret it
Try the pork chop or the shrimp with palm hearts
One of the most unique dining experiences I've had in the village, if not the city
I went to Esperanto last night with my mother, my boyfriend and a friend and We had a wonderful experience
Our server, Carla, was very helpfull teling us about the most special and popular drinks as well as the specials
We had the caipirinas with mango and I had to taste also, the passion fruit caipirina, they were amazing
Then, our waitress sugested us to take the tuna ceviche and a crab apetizer, She higly recomemnded also the special of the night wich was a shirimp with a kind of dark sauce with just a spicy taste, the moqueca and the red snapper, everything was excellent, specialy a chocolate dessert that she suggested to take in advance
We felt very happy about the place in general and thanks to our waitress we had a great tasting experince
It was our first time an we will be back
I was there on Cinco de Mayo with a couple of friends
The waitress we had was shady and pushy from the beginning
When we ordered the ceviche (excellent) she took off to find out if they still had some left
When we tried to track her down to see if we were going to get it and to give her the rest of our order - she said of course they had it and acted as if she didn't understand our confusion
During the rest of our dinner she was aggressive - not to be mistaken with courteous or attentive
At the end of the meal I complained to the hostess, Aida, and she apologized and bought us a round of drinks - definitely making up for the bad experience
I'll keep going back because the food, music and atmosphere were excellent, as always
My boyfriend and another couple went to eat at Esperanto last weekend, and it turned out to be such a great find! We got there early so we sat at the bar and had some mojitos while we waited for our friends
They tasted so great! When the other couple showed up the manager seated us promptly for our reservation
When we ordered they took tunas and steak, and I took the moqueca, which is a really delicious fish stew that comes in a beautiful steaming pot
Everything tasted great
The service was fast and friendly, and combined with the delicious food and great ambiance made for a great night out
Highly recommended!
Some friends had recommended Esperanto to me and I finally got a chance to go
The were totally right, and I loved it! I had their pork chop entree, my girlfriend had grilled salmon and we ended up splitting a coconut flan
Service was on the ball and the food came out quickly and tasted great
Plus it was really lively and fun-- a nice choice for a Friday night
All in all we had a great time, and we will definitely be back
the male host and 1 male waiter's attitude sucked big time! Attention deficit disorder or intentional ignorance or blindness was their game
Place is very crowded can wait long time for food or food doesn't come out at same time
Food and cocktails are good and inexpensive
The service is not the best here- In particular, groups are hard here
But for a small group or date definitely worth it
Very inexpensive and great tasting
The steak was very inexpensive and was very flavorful
The drinks are good as well
Definitely the place for those that are watching the budget and want that New York feel
Esperanto had great food and very good service
The coconut rice was amazing, but the pork chop was a little fatty
You MUST get the chocolate souffle
I'm not much of a chocolate lover, but this dessert was great
If you're going in a large group, you should make reservations because that place gets packed
The food is great, from traditional brazilian dishes like feijoada to more unusual options like shrimp cooked in coconut milk with tomatoes and hearts of palm
The caipirinhas are small but strong and tasty, especially the special made with fresh mango
Waitstaff is friendly, but consistently rather assertive about suggesting more appetizers, dessert, etc
Our waitress pushed us to pre-order the chocolate souffle pretty hard, but it was really good
Prices are moderate, but add up when you give into ordering more yummy sides, like fried bananas, and cocktails
I had high hopes for this high-ranked wonder, only to be let down by inattentive service doubled by LONG food and drink wait times
We were sat at our table relatively quick, but waited almost 10 minutes until our drink orders were taken
Another 20 minutes or so until food orders were taken and then it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food
The waitress never came back to get drink refills and we didn't get water until we were halfway through our dinner
Just plain horrible, I'll never go back!
this is, without a doubt, one of the BEST places i have ever been to eat
the atmosphere is incredible
some nights there is live music (the band i've heard is great), the drinks are great, especially the mojitos, and the food is outrageous
try the moqueca bahiana, or however it's spelled
and be sure to ask them how to eat it
the camarones de la feria, grilled salmon, pollo de la casa, and the crab in bananna leaf are all great
they also have brunch on sundays (saturday, too?) and it is just as good as dinner! the eggs benedict is spicy and the best i've ever had, and the bloody mary's are top notch
desserts are, of course, incredible
the chocolate volcano melts in your mouth and the flan is delicious
to top it all off, the service is friendly and great! this place really is the best!!
Went here late last Friday night and had one of the best meals I've had in NYC
I have no idea what restaurant the negative reviewers were eating at, but I have to urge you to give Esperanto another chance
Four of us went and not one was dissappointed
Most of the specials were sold out but the staples were just fine for us
Highly recommend the shrimp and hearts of palm in coconut sauce!
Went with my girlfriend the other night, and it couldn't have been nicer
We sat outside and had a really nice meal -- She had the red snapper (moist and seasoned nicely, I stole a couple of bites
) and I had the steak, which was juicy and really hit the spot
We both had the caipirinias (I may have mispelled that but there's no mistaking that they tasted great, sweet but limey) Anyway, all in all a really nice night
We are definitely going back soon!
The facility and ambiance are great for outdoor dining and drinks

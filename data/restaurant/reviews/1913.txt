Quickly and snippily, the hostess snapped back, amp;quot;That table is being set for 5
amp;quot; Ok, I thought
Sure enough, the table further back was seated with 3 people AFTER we were seated
Once I pointed this out to the hostess in a cool, calm manner, I was barraged with rude comebacks such as I'm sorry
(while clapping and mocking me for others to see), please enjoy your day off
Shocking
No one deserves to be insulted like that
I love this place! Those who have rated it otherwise do not know the value of such a authentic, creative, delicious restaurant
Rushed? I thought one point of good service was quick seating and quick food
All dishes are amazing, but I love # 26, and here you will find masaman curry like no other
The food was o
k
, but I felt rushed and was treated like a child by the hostess
Too many good places with good customer service to waste your time here
been there a few times on both wkdays and wkends
There's no wait during the beginning of the week, but once the weekend sets in, i've waited for about 15-20 minutes
small price to pay to have dinner on a Saturday night in downtown Manhattan
had drinks at the bar were pretty close to the hostess
we tried not to ask her more than once for an update on our table b/c we noticed how many of the same impatient people kept going up to her ovr ovr
she then led us to our cozy table and we ordered our delicious lychee-tinis dinner from a very helpful,friendly waitress
The food was delicious,authentic, hearty with no frills
it is what it is
Met friends there on a Friday night and food, as usual, was fantastic
Thai that melts in your mouth and never disappoints - the flavor is like no other Thai I've tried
It's expensive, but worth the splurge
The flavor of their own mixed drinks are a bit sour and lacking in flavor, but it's the food that deserves the focus here
Restaurant has a great candle lit, modern ambiance that is great for groups, or for a romantic dinner
Will definately continue to go back again and again
First time having Thai food and Kin khao made me a fan
Appetizers were excellent and the main courses were even better
Recommend to Thai lovers and also those looking to experiment
My partner and I were shopping in SoHo when the overcast skies turned darker and soft showers threatened heavier ones
Our tummies were growling, too, so we decided to remedy two problems and ducked into this little cafe on Thompson, with its bright yellow windows beckoning and revealing a cozy interior
This was exactly what we needed! For $40, we got two lunch entrees, one side, attentive service, a smiling staff and two hot drinks kept warm with constant refills
One first bite from the bread basket encouraged us to tour the flavors of the other simple but flavorful cookies, biscuits and muffins
The last bite, as we cleaned our plates, left us mournful for more -- so we'll be back soon!
My wife and I found this place years ago while living in NJ and working in NYC
We fell in love with the food and made it our special occasion restaurant
Since we have moved into Manhattan we can now enjoy it as often as we like and it has not lost it's luster
Our favorite appitizers are the delicious smoked eggplant with goat cheese on toasted croutons and the beet salad
I have had everyting on the menue and enjoyed it all
The steak is very tasty and the couscousotto is also a favorite with either chicken or shrimp
The kitchen has always accomodated any requests from my party
The servers Annalia and Allen are very friendly and helpful
We have never had anything but wonderful experiences here over the past 4 years
I've been having brunch, lunch and dinnner at this small Bistro for 3 ys and have not gone bored yet, they recently changed the menu, which alway makes a regular freak out a little, it is as good
The cheaf can make an eggs benedict to perfection, the waitress Ana Lia is the cutest and nicest
c'me check it out
ops should I be writing it here, if it gets overcrowded, I'll remove this review
The perfect combination between warm ambiance, outstanding service and amazing dinner
Congratulation to cheff and excellent service offered by ANALIA (the waitress)  UNFORGETABLE
I found this charming little French Bistro on Thompson St
in Soho
To my amazement, this is one of the only restaurants I have visited that  Not only gives you an excellent Brunch, with eggs benedict,( one of the best I have ever had) but also with the waiter bring you a FREE basket of muffins, cookies and cakeAll this for about $12 dollars per person
The waitress showed me their lunch menus, which by the way is about the same price, but with French bento boxes
I was thrilled, I came back for dinner with some friends, I recommend the Snails garlic, Carpaccio is divine and Duck Confit, or the Coq au Vin, are perfection
And there, again like nowhere else we were offered a small Glass of port
What a find, thank you
I love this restaurant, the food is amazing, the prices are so reasonable, one can eat hear and still go shopping later
I wish that there were more Country Cafe's in other zip codes
This resturant is overratted
Based on all the rave reveiws, I had expected services to be at least up to par
Not the case at all
Food ranged from decent to good
However, the service that was outrageous
I had to ask for a glass of water 4x and still didn't get it
Towards the end, my wine glass was collected because they ran out of wine glasses, later didn't replace it
My waiter rarely checked on my table
Most upsetting is that an 18% tip is automatically added to the ck
when they deserve less then 10% (that is already being generous), so I could not even demonstrate my displeasure my leaving a small tip
There was a total of three waiters, and all three of them were terrible
Not matter how good the food is, if the service is bad, then that will ruin one's expereince
went here for brunch this past w/end - really enjoyed the food and the charm of the place
service wasn't the best (polite but very slow), but everything else was awesome
especially recommended for Frenchies who miss authentic French caf fare: have the croque monsieur/madame here and you'll feel like you're back in paris
two thumbs up
I am lucky to live just above Country Cafe and I never get tired of the amazing food and wine selection
But, Ana Lia, the waitress is definetly a eason to keep on coming back, she has memoized all the likes and dislikes which makes this restaurant just an extension of my house
This place was fantastic
Excellent service amazing food
Small, but charming and very French
This is absolutely the cutest restaurant in Soho
The service is superb, the food is amazing with fantastic portions, they have a fine selections of wines too at great prices
I am amazed on how the deserts always impress me and their cappucinos are perfect! i don't have enough good things to say about this fun little niche
Recently had a memorable meal at the Country Cafe having stumbled upon it whilst strolling through the streets of SOHO
Despite the late hour, the Service was impeccable - which was particularly impressive as on another table staff were having their patience tested by an obnoxious bunch from NYU
The food and overall experience was fantastic
I'd recommend it to anyone !
Every place has signature dish
Here the chocolate cheesecake summarizes the paradox of Zoe: the taste was both bland and offputting, the texture unappealing
Each of the other dishes we had were boring, even tasteless, and in all there was just something off
Service left something to be desired, though not fault of particular waiter--the training clearly is subpar
Zoe may have once been good, but it is simply tired
The food and ambience at Zoe are both first class
There is a nice bar (weve had a drink there a couple of times as a break from SoHo shopping and the cheese sticks are an additional attraction) and the dining area is light and airy with an open kitchen
Last night was the first time wed eaten dinner there and the food was delicious (the polenta fries were outstanding)
Also, the staff are great
The maitre d gave us her favorite table, which was a cozy corner booth
Our waiter was delightful (thanks, Luke), and when he conveyed our appreciation of the mission figs appetizer to the kitchen, the chef seemed genuinely pleased
Definitely a repeat experience

We are Turkish and we really know what the good Turkish food is
Please try another Turkish restaurants in NYC
This a great spot for some great food
I've been going here since I was a kid and have never ahd a bad meal
It is a littl small always has been but its avery cozy place wher the waitrs come right up to as soona s they see you need them
Their food is amazing
Best lentil soup I;ve veerhad and sigara boregia nd shepherds sald are worth travelling long distances to get to
High marks for a simple but great turkish retsuarant in brooklyn
The best!!!!!!!!!! The best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Highly recommend! very low cost, great food
I was living next to this Restaurant for years and went there way too many times
It is just great, one if not the best Turkish Restaurant in Brooklyn
Yes, it does not have as much class as Turkish Kitchen does, but the food is much much better and much cheaper
I've never had a bad meal there
It has all usual turkish dishes and more
An entire meal could be made just from the starters (such as the grilled eggplant salad, artichokes in lemon juice and stuffed grape leaves ) and a crusty loaf of the oversize flatbread called pide
The sigara boregi, pan-fried cigar-shaped rolls of phyllo stuffed with feta cheese, are cooked until they're crisp and golden
Main courses include char-grilled whole brook trout, baby lamb sotee, and (of course) kebabs of lamb and chicken; Try the thick Turkish coffee with a dessert of Kunefe with cheese !
The best Square ever
I grew up across the street and now my 20 year old son makes sure I bring home pizza from LB anytime I am in brooklyn
The spamoni is the best with the pistacio being the best of the best! There is no better place to enjoy a slice outside and watch Brooklyn life go by
I've been making trips to LB since I was 4, and I am now 54
This pizza is the BEST anywhere for grandma slices! It's tomatoey with a fresh, thin slice of mozzarella and a dusting of parmesan
We live in NJ now, and whenever we are in Brooklyn to visit folks we detour to LB and bring home a half a pie (12 slices) to freeze
With other pizza I eat one slice, but with this amazing pizza, I eat 3 and have to force myself to stop (and I am 110 lbs!)
You've GOT to try it! Sit outside at the picnic tables and have yourself a treat
Everyone knows Brooklyn is home to the best Pizza in the world, but when you taste Ciccios, you'll realize it's the best Pizza in Brooklyn
Must try the Sophia Loren, garlic, fresh Mozz, fresh Tomato
it's LOVE
Family owned and operated, neighborhood friendly and fun atmostphere
Ciccio's is quite simply the best pizza in new york
Save the canned sauces and tasteless crust for those who don't know better
THIS IS HEAVEN! Sesame seeds along the outside of the crust, fresh crushed tomato's and basil and fresh MOOTZ(on demand) is what makes this the ultimate slice, pie, or pies you'll ever have the pleasure of sitting down to
The Sofia Loren is head and shoulders above anything else
try the PAN pizza, unlike anything you've had! You'd wish they delivered throughout the five boroughs, or you may want to move to the neighborhood to have it every nite!!
In Short Hot dogs don't go for a nickel as they did when the stand opened in 1916 on the Coney Island boardwalk
But folks still line up for Nathan's famous hot dogs and crinkle-cut fries
A perennial summer favorite, the hot dogs have a distinctive crispy skin--and regulars swear by the all-beef franks
Toppings include chili, sauerkraut, onions and cheese
I ordered the Chicken Caeser Salad which came with a gnat in the lettuce and a few croutons
I also bought a water which came out of the fridge warm
mind you this was on a weekday before the lunch rush
I would stick to a hotdog or eat before you go to the boardwalk
I grew up in Coney Island
I haven't had a Nathans hot dog in almost 6 years now
Just the thought of them makes me salivate
The crispy skin, the juicy bite, the smoldering fries
It's the best, the original, and the only place anyone should go for a great dog and fries
Nathans makes Coney Island
to have a hot dog in ny is a tradition
to have one at coney island, where the hot dog was invented, is the ultimate
for some reason the original location on stillwell and neptune isnt listed on city search
go the extra couple of blocks and get your hot dog, fries and lemon aid there! we went a week ago, off season, the place was empty and you can get a seat outside which was awesome
Reliable, quality Italian food
I've been eating there since the mid-fifties, although it's been open since the twenties
The Scene The gruff Brooklyn attitude that greets newcomers is all part of the shop's allure
As the city's oldest continually operating pizza parlor opened in 1924, Totonno feels lived in and well loved
Awards, photos of sports stars and presidents, and newspaper clippings line the walls
The utilitarian tables serve only one purpose: showcasing the restaurant's fabulous pies
The crowd's a mix of families, old-timers and curious city slickers
The Food The coal-fired brick oven makes a world of difference, charring the slightly salty, airy-on-the-inside, crisp-on-the-outside crust and lightly browning the toppings on the paper-thin pie
Slices of rich mozzarella dot the pizza, with a sweet tomato sauce drizzled on top to avoid sullying the crust
The white pizza with pecorino Romano cheese is a house specialty
Either owing to its thin dough or its seductive balance of flavors, two adults can easily finish a large and leave happy
The Best Pizza in New York - Period
Thin crust, great sauce, fresh cheese
You cannot top this
Run to Coney Island - Now!
I've tried every pizza place in the nyc area
Hands down Totonno's is #1
I only get the white pizza
No ricotta, just tons of garlic, great olive oil and the best cheese and crust around! Sorry, but anybody that gives Totonno's a bad review
knows NOTHING about pizza!  p
s I'm going this Friday before the Cylones game!
I have to admit, being a native Brooklynite, I never got down to Totonno's until recently
As it turned out I wasn't missing anything
For all the hype and history surrounding Totonno's, it falls flat on so many levels
Yes the crust is thin (which is good), but the sauce was very runny and made the crust soggy
Except for an over abundance of garlic (too much in fact), there was no other taste to the sauce
The service was abrupt and rude
moreso than your typical Brooklyn attitude
We were yelled at to wait outside when we got there even though we already had a table inside (friends were there)
Given the plethora of great pizza parlors in NYC, Totonno's is not worth the trip
Go to Lombardi's or Grimaldi's instead
Don't eat at Totonno's if you plan on enjoying pizza anywhere else
You will be spoiled forever! The crust so perfectly salted and charred
The tangy tomatoes
Fresh mozzarella
Add the fact that it's cooked in an 80 year old coal-fired oven (one of only a few still permitted in New York City)
Very friendly, family atmosphere
plenty of old New York memorabilia decorating the place will keep your eyes busy after you order
But don't count on waiting long: our pizza was on the table in 5 minutes flat
Amazing! We even had Coca Cola in glass bottles along with our pie
A nice touch
If you want the real deal of New York pizza, THIS IS IT!
Yummy freshly-made mozzarella and a perfectly done crust add up to an incredible coal-fired oven pizza
I'd recommend the half-and-half pie on your first visit; that way you can make up your mind if you like the red pie or white pie better
I'm still undecided! Not much atmosphere or amenities, but you're there for the pizza anyway
The service was friendly and competent, contrary to legend
This place is completely worth whatever effort it takes for you to get there

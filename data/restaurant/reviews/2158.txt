We love sushi and realize it is expensive but this place is out of control
Not only are their prices astronomical but they had the nerve to charge us for an extra bottle of sake that we never ordered or drank! When we pointed this out to the manager he did not believe us and took his waiter's side over ours
I recommend to everyone not to waste their time or money at this establishment
Unremarkable decor, classic sushi
(The rainbow roll is quite possibly the most beautiful food item I have ever seen
) I am obsessed with sushi and will verify here that Sushi Sen-nin is one of the best New York offers
The wait can be long, but it's worth it--the chefs are making art
The food was excellent with generous portions (having sampled a variety of sushi/sashimi), but I wouldn't go back there for lunch again, at least not on a weekday
I work in midtown and I've been there three times with my wife for lunch, and each time we waited at least forty (40) minutes after giving our orders to get our food!
I'd probably walked past this place 20 times without even noticing it before it was recommended to me by a friend
There's definitely nothing special about it when it comes to ambiance, but once the food comes, that won't matter
hands down the best sushi I've ever eaten
Very fresh, excellent presentation, interesting and flavorful sauces and large pieces make Sushi Sen-nin a must try if you're a sushi lover
Pricey, yes, but worth it, certainly
Fresh selections are prepared beautifully
Portions are large, as well
A friend of mine had been trying to get me to eat here for three years
I finally made it last night and I have to wonder why I waited so long! My friend was delayed forty minutes due to the NYC Subway and while I waited the staff was attentive and did not make me feel unwelcome at all
The food? Magnificent
I had the shrimp in wine sauce and my friend had the paella
We both enjoyed our dishes very much
The sauce was delicate with just the right touch of sweetness added by the sweet peppers
Of course we had sangria and it was the perfect complement to our meal
I plan to order the paella the next time so I can bring some home to enjoy the next day
I left my reading glasses on the table and a staff member ran out to give them to me
I would recommend this restaurant to everyone
It is small but if you linger after your meal no one is hovering to throw you out
I ate at El Pote Espaol during prime lunch hour and thought it was fantastic
Though, I have to say that the place is a bit small, but rest assured that there is ample space between the tables if you are claustrophobic
In terms of decoration, the place is appropriately decorated with various Spanish motifs and Catelan accents
Food
I ordered the paella valencia and I must say that the portion is definitely worth the very affordable price
Ingredients were fresh and the way the waiters served the paella was also very pleasing
Not to mention that the food had that particular home style seasoning which gave the dish a succulent twist
I have to agree with the other reviewers and do not miss the thirst quenching sangria - one of the best around the city - which is a great substitute for wine (which by the way El Pote Espaol has a limited selection) and a great compliment to the food
Overall, I have to highly recommend El Pote Espaol from anyone that has never had any typical dishes to the most demanding and savy connoisseur in Spanish food
The food was good (rack of lamb was superb), the sagria was great, the staff was super friendly
Its a good place for big parties and good Spanish food
but this place didn't need it to make your mouth water
the food was delicious and the staff attentive
the paella was amazing -- and of course, the sangria wasn't too bad either
A low-key local place, El Pote is a small restaurant that puts more emphasis on its food than it's decor
The food is very tasty and portions are hearty
Don't forget to have the sangria! The staff is friendly and attentive but not too disrupting (ie, if you have a cozy table in the corner, it can be a romantic spot)! El Pote will become a new staple on my boyfriend's and my dine-out list!
This cafe is great for a lunch-in-a-rush, either for take out or delvery
(Not a great place to stay and eat, though
)  The turkey burgers, onion rings and pizza are all very good and quickly served
A variety of salds and hot cold entrees are available
I have been going here for years and have always found everything about this restaurant to be exceptional
Caterina, Tommy and the staff are extremely friendly and most helpful
The food and service have always been superb
It is a very friendly atmosphere and the entertainment on weekends just puts everything over the top
Donald is a bartender, par excellence, Gregory is an outstanding musician and Kelly the maitre de will stun you with his Broadway vocals
In addition to all the above, the guest performers sound as though they just stepped off a stage
The pricing is moderate but a great value for the dollar considering that you are in midtown-Manhattan
This restaurant caters to a mature well dressed clientele and if you are looking for a fun night out, I highly recommend Caterina's
There is a parking garage directly across the street
Being Hungarian myself I know the cusine well
It was such a disappointment to go to the only Hungarian restaurant in the city, and have such a terrible experience
I took my in-laws there who are not Hungarian, and was embarrassed! The food was terrible
It did not have the true Hungarian flavor, it was blan
The appetizer selection was poor, and the main course selection was not that good either
Every single person at my table (it was 6 of us) disliked the food
The only part I liked was the desert and the service was friendly
The prices are way too high for the quality of the food, and the ambiance of the restaurant was shameful
I would not recommend this place and I will not be returning
I'm sticking to mom's cooking!
I was here again on my uncle's birthday bash in August
We dined, drank and were entertained like royalty! Highly recommend for a true Hungarian experience
Make sure to have a few melodies in mind and ask the pianist to play for you
Thank you again Caterina :)
Best Reuben sandwich ever! A classic! Don't miss Bloom's on your next trip to Manhatten
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York
Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip
I have never had cheescake like this
I thought I had died and gone to heaven
Had a fantastic omlette here
sandwiches are about 6 inches high and filled with layers of deli meat goodness
The service was a bit slow, but they were very friendly
No refills on fountain drinks, though
Great food, great prices, great service
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place
This place looks promising - the dining room is open and airy, it's quiet enough to have a conversation, and the staff is courteous
The food, however, is completely uninteresting - my special of the day pasta was decent, but definitely not worth the money, the wine wasn't particularly spectacular, and the bread
I've never been to a restaurant before with bad bread
usually that's your saving grace
but this stuff was inedible!
only thing i have to say about belluno is
GREAT GREAT GREAT
,guys know well how to make costumer happy,since we discovered bellunos , we live there, great food,,,great service ,,,,great ambiance,,,,thank you guys
Belluno has fabulous Italian food, although a bit pricey
The pasta, fish and meat dishes were excellent!! They have a great list of daily specials, as well
The management and waitstaff are very attentive, professional and definitely aim to please! Wine list was great, too
Very chic atmosphere
great place for a quiet dinner, but also able to accomodate a larger group
I agree w/ the previous review
I came across this place one day
Co-workers and I ordered from this place for the first time last week
The Free Delivery arrived within 45 minutes (large order)
All of us loved the food had had absolutely no complaints

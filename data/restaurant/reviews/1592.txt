I then had to defend my opinion to that waiter, the host, and several other waitstaff
I can honestly say I hate this place and encourage others to stay away
I hope this place goes out of business soon
Can be nice for couples and small groups
If you want to speak to each other, don't sit in the front room with the bar
On my most recent visit, the mussels were quite poor and sandy
Don't be afraid to send them back
Homey and packed-in atmosphere, but still fun and intriguing
Food is definitely good
This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York
It's very unpretentious; the food is always fresh, simple and perfectly prepared; and it's a great value
I've been coming here since the summer of 1998 when it opened, and I've never had less than a great experience
The perfect, downtown neighborhood joint
My food was good, the waiters were cute, but they were so inattentive
I was waiting for my drink or water or some liquid of some kind and I never got my drink or anything! Don't go when they're changing shifts, you'll get ignored
Very good(and solid) southern italian food w/ an appetizing menu that makes it tough not to order more than you can eat
Offers many wines by the glass, most of which are good
Yes the space is cramped, there's usually a wait, and the service is hectic, but that's all part of the fun
As Yogi says Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded
So if you want a good meal at a good price w/ lots of atmosphere, try Frank's, just make sure you're hungry
If you've been to Europe and sat at a small cafe or restaurant, enjoyed great food and wine and don't mind sitting right next to the person at the next table, then you'll love this place
It's not an over-Americanized Italian restaurant
It's got charm and does not cater to large groups
This is the place for a couple of friends or lovers to meet up for a quiet meal
The food is great, but they don't always serve both people at the same time, which is a little unconventional
There is reasonably priced wine by the bottle so two people can enjoy good wine and food for $60
We were seated right away but we went on a Sunday so Friday and Saturday might yield different results
What's all the hype about this place? The restaurant is tiny so there's always a wait - which is misleading cuz everybody thinks it's a good place
The appetizers were just OK
I got the proscuitto and figs special and that's what i got
just Proscuitto and figs
Bruschetta wasn't so bad
BUT do not get the liver pate
it looked disgusting and the pate was slapped on pieces of bread
- The waiter forgot to bring one entree but was nice enough to offer it to us on the house although the rest of us were almost done and we thought the food was so bad it wasn't even worth taking
- Same sauce for all pastas
It was so bland and not tasty at all
- the Meatloaf looked like one big meatball
- You're better off trying other great restaurants around the area for the same prices
my boyfriend and I go to Frank 2 or 3 times a month
We love it
The food is always delicious and the waitstaff has always been very friendly
We have always had to wait for a table but if you go expecting that, its no big deal
Again and again we find ourselves at Frank, yumm
Frank is really crowded, so don't come here expecting to grab a table right away
Instead grab a beer at the bar where the cool bartender will take great care of you
Pastas and specials are awesome
I have been a long time customer and noticed that service has improved exponentially
This place is as close as you get to being in southern Italy
Cool crowd here too
We sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen - that was entertainment enough in itself
The service was pushy and raw but the food spoke for itself
I'd stick to Italian classics, get there during off-times, or volunteer to sit at the kitchen bar
If you are looking to relax and enjoy a nice evening this is your place
It's not big so you may have to wait but it is worth it
The food was outstanding and the decor fits perfect with the neighborhood
The service is not only rude but disgusting
My fiance needed change of a dollar for the meter outside
He was told by 4 different servers change is not given, they only deal in paper money
Then the waitress had the audacity to sit down at my table while he was getting change next door, and tell me and two of my colleagues what a rude person my fiance was! I have never heard of such a thing
Don't go there, ever!!! They completely suck!!!!! and the food is not that great
Frank is a good place to go with friends - good bang for the buck
Food is definitely good and well worth it
They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait, and the service could be much better
Al in all though, a good place to go for a relatively inexpensive meal
Not for me
The starter was poor and tasteless
The salmon was served with a bunch of salad leaves in an overpowering dressing
Didn't hang around for desert
Tried to check out Frank last weekend
Total Disaster
I highly recommend avoiding Frank because the service sucks
Horrible doesn't apply, because they simply don't care
Went with a party of 7
After getting on the list at 8 pm, we were told 45 minute wait
No problem, we waited, and an hour later were told it would be 10 more minutes
Long story short, they were holding our table for people sipping cocktails, but not eating, so around 10:15 we went next door to East Post and had a blast
I wonder if Frank realizes how much coin he loses by entrusting business to these clowns
What a joke
I can't understand why you want to own a place where people get mistreated by a bunch of unclean looking servers
I hear the food is good, but I'll never know
However, I will recommend this place to people I hate
Been to Frank numerous times over the last three years and the one constant has always been the great tasting food
The service varies from time to time ranging from great to horrible and the decor leaves much to be desired
If its your first time, try Frank on a weeknight because Fridays and Saturdays are very busy
If your not in a hurry and dont mind sitting right next to everyone else
try Frank
Overall -- Food is good but is it really worth it? For me -- Sometimes
I used to go to Frank when it first opened
I marveled at the simplicity and freshness of the food, though I never understood the meat loaf
The pasta was always good
The brunch was above par considering the neighborhood
Definitely ahead of it's time
Very briefly
Even before they expanded, I can't figure out who would decide on the ignorant/dirty/aloof host/ess standing outside not seeming to give a dam
Even if I was young hip and skinny I would rather go somewhere else a little more cool to get mistreated
Not worth the wait or even the used-to-be above average food
There are far better comtemporary Italians in the neighborhood
I've lived in NYC for 5 years and never had a worse experience in a restaurant than at Frank
The service was downright rude

The crabcake left much to be desired and the ravioli was too salty that I just couldn't finish it
The sauvignon blanc I ordered was passable
The only redeemable food was the chocolate cake, which is the best among the three courses, but honestly, still nothing to be praised
Any bistro in chelsea has much better food, with similar ambience at a better value
Unless you and your date are candles-obsessive, this place is a little overrated
We went to Candela and had a 9pm reservation
We waited for an hour to be seated as did three other groups with 9pm reservations
Our waitress was great and bought us a round of drinks to acknowledge how annoying it was
The food was fine, and the atmosphere was nice
As long as you don't mind hanging out in a crowded bar area waiting for your table its a good place to go
I went to Candela on Monday night and had such an amazing experience
First of all, it has the most candles I've ever seen in a restaurant
The lighting and music set the mood: modern and sexy
The staff, from the people that greeted me on the way in, to the bartender, and the service staff will all very friendly and professional
I noticed this because it is not typical in popular NYC restaurants
Our food was amazing, especially the cod dish which was recommended by our waitress
and the chocolate cake dessert
YUM!  I will defenitly go back to candelas~
This restaurant is perfect for a date
It has many candles which makes it very romantic and cozy
The food and service were excellent
We also tried sushi and it was delicious! You should go try it! It won't let you down
Oh, the prices were not so bad either, we paid $58 for chicken, salmon, one sushi roll, one ceasar salad and soda :)
For once this is a restaurant that actually contains food that matches its atmosphere
The cuisine is literally to die for! The wine is just as tasty, but everything that Candela serves, from the pate and bread to the entrees are amazing
I ordered the sesame-ginger salmon, which was so delicious, but my date ordered the tuna, and it was absolutely out of this world! Although the busboy brought us the wrong entrees (he accidentally handed us the opposite plate), I felt the service was great and they did not try to rush us out of there, but let us sit and talk without trying to ask us if we are finished too soon
This is an amazingly romantic restaurant for any date
GREAT PLACE FOR INTIMATE CANDLELIT DINING, GREAT FOOD AND GREAT SERVICE
When i first stepped into this restuarant, i was greeted by the sweetest girls, there was no attitude in this place, we were seated at a great table right away and the waiter was outstanding so tactful knew just when to come over and knew when to leave us alone
I had the crab cake and it was amazing the best i ever had
I also had the sushi a crispy shrimp roll and a salmon and avacodo roll and some of the freshest tuna nigiri
We shared the dessert warm chocolate cake the icecream tasted like the wopper candy, all in all i am dying to go back to eat here it was a nite i will always remember
The candles everywhere are extremely ROMANTIC!
The waitstaff is friendly attractive and attentive, the decor is medieval torture meets Martha Stewart posh, but the food falls flat
The dishes try to be a mish mash of a lot of things that don't amount to much
Come here for the atmosphere and ambience with friends but not for the food, good place for drinking
I've gone to Candela's 3 times already and have received the best service, food and ambiance
We had a huge party and it turned out great! Our waitress was extremely attentive
The decor is romantic but also very relaxed
Their food was incredibly good
Thanks for a great time! For those pessimist out there, try not to think of this as too romatic and you would have a great time! Oh, you can even park at the garage next door for only $7 with Candela's validation
I recently got engaged at candela's and the staff and management where great at attending to all my fiances needs
The restaurant is very romantic - if you get a booth table, other wise the regular table are way to close together
The food is very good and the creme brulee is delicous
I went to Candela this past Saturday night after 11pm and this beautiful restaurant turned into a bar/lounge
The music was great, the crowd a bit young (early 20s), but not at all pretentious, which is hard to find these days
We got a table, which wasn't too expensive compared 2 some places
The apple martinis are great, the service can use a bit of work though
As a whole I had a good time and would recomend Candela not as a restaurant as I did not sample the food, but as a nice bar
I took my girlfriend soon to be fiance to Candela and we had a great time
She thought it looked like a castle inside
The candles are great and the atmosphere is fun
It has a nice bar as well
I would advise other to go
This place is beautiful with a billion candles and high ceilings
Romantic place to being your date
Service was good the waitress was very attentive
Their appetizers are tasty, the calamari, smoked salmon and crab cakes are things that I would definatly recommend
The only big dissappointment was the main courses, the cod fish was too sour, the filet minion was over cooked, the steak with blue cheese wasnt a good combo, the seared tuna had no flavor and the lamb chops tasted like cardboard
Go here
only to have drinks and appetizers but please dont order their main courses!
I definitely recommend taking your partner here for a romantic dinner for two
The place had a great atmosphere
The prix fixe menu is also a good value
The food isn't the best I've had, but this restaurant is somewhere you go for the atmosphere
I visited Candela to celebrate a friend's birthday with a group
Interesting menu
The food was delicious, but a little pricey
The sushi is very good!
I am from Louisiana and must eat at Candela any time I visit NY!! My favorite is their french toast
The last time I visited, I tried it and can't get it out of my head
The service and ambiance were great as well
Also loved the location! Great access to everything!! A must try for visitors and locals!!
I go to Candela at least once a month because of among other things, its dependability
I've liked everything I've ever had there - from the sushi to the warm chocolate cake (Yum!) The decor is cool
The crowd is attractive
The food is always delicious, and contrary to the review I just read on here, I think the prices are pretty good
Plus it's surrounded by several other cool places if you feel like bar hopping afterward
I always recommend this place to my friends that come visit the city
Very romantic
My husband and I enjoyed the romantic atmosphere even at 6pm when it was still light outside
Heavy curtains and candles make great decoration
Prices, however, do not justify whatyou eat
We ordered two dinner meals, appetizer (pan-asian, not that good), 1 glass of wine and we spent almost $100
Good to visit on special occasions but not every weekend
I found this restaurant after moving to the union square area in 11/02, and I have been eating here since then
The food is amazing, and the service is great
The entire restaurant is candlelit (Candela
), making it sooo cute and romantic
It's no wonder that it is one of the best date restaurants in New York! The prices are beyond reasonable for the exceptional experience
This restaurant was a pure delight
Yesterday was my first year anniversary with my girlfriend and this was the perfect place to spend it
The candles give the place such a warm, cozy feeling
We felt as if we were dining in Medieval castle
It was great
The food was wonderful and the service friendly and prompt
I was also surprised that the bill was way below what I had expected to pay
All in all, Candela was a wonderful discovery
This may well be the noisiest restaurant I have ever been to
There is no sound proofing, plenty of hard services for the noise to bounce of off, and nothing to block out the din from the busy bar area

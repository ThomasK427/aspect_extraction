There are very few places left in the city where you can hear real music anymore -- Gershwin, Porter, jazz standards and classic rock -- songs everyone knows the words to
Table XII has Michael Garin, who was the piano guy at the Monkey Bar for over a decade, and the atmosphere is fantastic and fun
The lounge, separate from the main restaurant in the front of the building, is intimate and cozy, and Michael plays and sings with little to no amplification, so you can have a conversation and you won't leave deaf! The bartenders are friendly, the food is wonderful -- you'll feel like it's 1956
Order a bottle of champagne
I was invited to Table XII for a private party
I loved the food so much I went back with some colleagues and they were equally impressed
The service is impeccable
I was treated like royalty and as I looked around that is the norm
The food was incredible and it is just such a comfortable place for social and client dining
I love that it is in midtown and that it is in my city
It's amazing!!!! The private dinner I was there for was exceptional as well
Treat yourself and GO!
One of the last places I would ever dream of hearing about a wonderful new restaurant would be the doctor's office
You can probably imagine how taken aback I was when I walked in for my routine check- up last tuesday morning and heard some of the staff still talking about the new wonderful place they ate at friday night
Being a true New Yorker, I find that frequenting the same spots bores me, so I perked up my ears and jumped at the opportunity to check out Table XII for myself
Four words- Ravioli ricci di mare
Excellent food, excellent atmosphere, just excellent!
From coordination to execution, TABLE XII is top notch! We recently arranged a retirement lunch for twenty-five people and I'm still getting pats on the back for choosing it! The food is excellent, the restaurant is beautiful and the service is second to none
Do yourself a favor and arrange your next event at TABLE XII!
Visited Gigino's on Valentine's Day, a little skeptical and was overjoyed at the selection
The service and ambience were excellent, the food was great and very reasonable
I would highly recommend the asparagus appetizer with mascarpone and mozarella
Main course (pasta with a tomato based beef and veal sauce), although nothing TOO special was very tasty
Dessert (dipped strawberries and cream) was also excellent
View is amazing
I would suggest taking a cab
Parking is nowhere to be found
Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable
The food is delicious
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view
Its not the same if you have to sit inside
For the location, the prices are very reasonable
The view is spectacular and the patio is a great place for a very relaxed lunch
Unfortunately, that lunch can take a loooooong time as the waiters seem to forget food orders, forget drink orders, and forget to refill water glasses
The food is quite tasty but a bit expensive for the setting
The mozzarella in the caprese was as fresh as I've ever had it, and the tomatoes were tasty
My entree of risotto with mushrooms left a bit to be desired, but everyone in the group of 10 was more-or-less pleased with their choices
Dessert was good, but not great
The kitchen is too small to accomodate the seating, and our dinner took 3 hours
Staff was pleasant, relatively hard working, but a tad forgetful
The view was gorgeous
you have the whole New York Harbor at your disposal
We went during the day, but I imagine at night it must be breathtaking
If you're not in a rush and want to show someone a breathtaking view, hop on the 4/5 to Bowling Green
Gigino is a wonderful restaraunt in a beautiful setting
Views of the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty - what more could you ask for
Outdoor dining at its best
The service was very good, as was the food
The Grilled Goat Cheese Salad and Bruchetta were excellent, as was the Chicken Scallopine
One could not ask for a better atmosphere
Elegant but very casual dining! We're sorry we just found out about this restaurant - we will be going back
l
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret
The setting is casual and romantic
Prices are very good
The food is excellent! if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!
This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise
The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious
This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset
The view is spectacular, and the food is great
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well! Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City! One of my favorite places in Manhattan
The Scene The restaurant was erected in a time of heightened wealth and expectations--early 2001
Since then, the light-filled two-room atrium has made do, managing to keep its private eating nooks--separated by sheer curtains--lively with friends, business associates, ladies who lunch, romantic twosomes and anti-scenesters avoiding the crowd in front of Rocco's, just down the street
Service is good, with occasional tendencies to hover
The Food Authentic Indian is the restaurant's claim, predominantly northern (tandoori, lamb dishes), with southern thrown in for good measure (seafood, vegetarian dishes)
The spices aren't searing, but they are complex, and you'd do well to order any of the vegetarian selections, including a savory saag paneer (creamy cheese cubes in spinach sauce) or the delicious bhindi do piaza (spicy, gingery okra)
The apricot-stuffed lamb pasanda (slices of the meat; ask for it pink) is an original choice, and wonderful if you like your food sweet
Seafood--particularly the fried pollack--is fresh but the shrimp moiley (buttery, coconut-touched shrimp) can be overdone
just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap
I definitely will go back
Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections
Decor is nice though service can be spotty
This place is always packed
I know because I live nearby
Most importantly, food is excellent
Try the sea bass
Highly recommended
although tamarind is pretty expensive, it's well worth it
the food here is awesome and the service tends to be very good as well
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning
try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the lamb vindaloo is great
very good breads as well
I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves
Yes, the prices are high, but I felt it was worth it
We all felt it was worth it
I'm Indian and can be picky about Indian food so I was surprised when I actually enjoyed the food at Tamarind
The chicken tikka masala was really tasty and that is the first time I ever enjoyed it
I liked that the food wasn't too greasy, it was well-prepared and the menu had a good selection
The staff was also very hospitable
It was a nice surprise to walk into a somewhat trendy Indian restaurant and get reliable dishes that tasted good! I would definitely go back
Though I do think they pack people in on busy nights so it's a bit too crowded
delicious food, excellent presentation, snooty service, but overall a must-go place for nice indian food
Adjacent Tea room has amazing sandwitches and different types of tea
managers go outta their way to make you feel comforable -- a must-go place to enjoy food, company and light indian music

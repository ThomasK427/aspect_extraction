I can't imagine going to New York and not visiting the Metropoitan or Il Cortille
I went to Il Cortile with a group of five people, and EVERYONE at the table was stunned beyond words by the food
Everything was SO flavorful and unique, it was absolutely to die for
It would be a sin to vacation in the City and not have dinner at Il Cortile
The service left something to be desired, but the food definitely made up for it
The veal is spectacular
My only complaint is that they don't offer dessert cannoli!
definitely one of the better places in little italy but maybe not the best
had a veal
was great and an enormous portion
house cabernet was very good (about $10)
coffee was good
bill was about $38
service was prompt and courteous
interior garden gave great decor
not sure what citysearch will give me but I would give it an 8
7
We went to Il Cortile for our Anniversary dinner
It was on a Monday night - so the restaurant was not packed
We were greeted at the door, and promptly seated
The waiter(s) were very attentive - but not overbearing
The food ---- ooooooooooo, the food was great
Had I not been with my husband, I would have married the chef!  It seems like it's hit or miss - since the reviews on this page are so polar opposite
My review (and I think I'm a good judge) is that Il Cortile was wonderful, and I would highly recommend it
Il Cortile is GREAT
Don't go at a busy time, because with a full house, I'm sure the staff just can't keep up
However, we went early -- sixish -- on a recent Saturday, got a very nice window table outlooking on Mulberry St
, a very sympathetic waiter who recommended a fabulous barolo, brought extra parmasiano when we told him how great it was, brought extra sauce for my date's pasta, and whoa! THAT VEAL SCALLOPINI IN COGNAC SAUCE WAS BEYOND WORDS!!! Dessert was on the house, we were allowed to linger over our wine without any rush whatsoever
just fantastic
By the way, I'm from Chicago, where we have a few great Italian restaurants
but nothing to match the wondrous Il Cortile
All the people on this site who didn't like this restaurant must have it confused with some other joint in Little Italy
couldn't possibly have eaten here
WHEN SEATED COLD PIZZA BREAD WAS BROUGHT TO THE TABLE
THE WAITER REFUSED OUR REQUEST TO HEAT IT
MY WIFES PORK CHOPS WERE SWIMMING IN BALSAMIC VINEGAR
AN ARTICHOKE DISH HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO ARTICHOKES
THE WAITERS AND STAFF WERE GENERALLY RUDE
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE
Being from Connecticut we don't get down to Mulberrry St
on a regular basis
However, when we do Il Cortile is the only restaurant we eat at
We leave up to the waiter to order our appetizers and we're never disappointed
The menu is a bit pricey but well worth it
After eating at Il Cortile the others are a far 2nd
Try this one, you won't be disappointed

Lupinacci
it is interesting to see only one positive on Il Cortile
We dined there while on vacation last December
Although we found the food to be good and the service to be good, I do understand about the reservation issues and the wait
We too had reservations but the gentleman never checked a book to see our names or check us off
so i don't even know if they take them
We were seated after about a 20 minute wait, and it was cold where we were! i found the food to be very good though
There are so many great places in Little Italy, don't waste your time and money here
The food is good, but the waiters only seemed attentive to large groups
What good is pasta w/o parmasean cheese? Also the food is a bit overpriced for the interior - the placemats are open napkins!
On a night hot as the hinges on the back door of Hades, I took my husband and two children to Il Cortile
We waited 30 minutes to be seated, 40 minutes for water, bread, menus, 30 more for wine and soft drinks and when the food finally arrived an hour later, it was inedible, burned on top from sitting under a heat lamp
The chef agreed - he wouldn't eat it either, he said
Instead of comping us for the diner, they removed the cost of two dishes out of four, with the same kind of apology you get when someone accidently knocked you in a crowded elevator
I gonna become a food writer instead of a fiction writer
Call the Health Department
Best INDOOR dining on Mulberry
The Garden Room is great and the food is good! Nice selections of wines as well
This is the best italian restaurant in litle Italy in NY
Not only because of the food, but also because of the service
Well
my review was initially 500 words long, but I am only allowed 150
So I am going to keep it short
I would compare our waiter to an extremley annoyed dybbuk chained to his job pretending to like it
he was being diplomatically rude, if you know what I mean
The self proclaimed manager was just the same, so to avoid going down to her level I just told her that she was right and I was wrong (wait
isn't that supposed to be her line?)
Maybe they were just annoyed that five Asian ladies had come on the day after Thanksgiving and make them work
or maybe we were stinky
sniff sniff
i think I smell fine :)
To my surprise, Ferrara's was excellent
Despite the long lines, the dessert was worth waiting for
There is great service and outdoor seating available
The prices aren't terrible as they're comparable to regular restarant desserts but completely of a different quality and caliber
Their creme brulee, bavarian creme puffs, various cakes (tiramisu, cheesecake, white chocolate) and multi-flavored gelatos are my favorites
Excellent bavarian mignon cream puffs
The napoleons, and rainbow cookies are pretty good too
The eclairs are so-so as are some of the pastries such as the chocolate mousse that look much better than they taste
The gelato was good one visit but tasted watered down the next
If you're eating at the cafe inside, the service is variable
Some servers are pleasant enough but some others seem to be unhappy to be at work to put it mildly
had to have the canneolis
the chocolate ones are good too
try the guava sorbet the next time you're there
just make sure it's not melting
What can you say, it's a pastry lover's dream
The pastries are prepared with much care and the cream could'nt be better
I highly recommend bringing visitors here as they will be impressed
Try the tarts, mousses, and ofcourse, the canolis!!!
Every Christmas my father used to drive from Long Island to get pastries from Ferrara's
Now, when I visit NYC I never miss a chance to go back
The cannoli is superb

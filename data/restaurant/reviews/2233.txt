If you are starving and low on cash you can give it a try, but you have been forewarned to avoid any non-vegetable dishes
The food is abolutely great
The fish dishes are my favorite and the prices are so cheap that you wont believe that you can get food so good for that price
They give a lot of food too
I would recommentd this place to anyone
I've tried their chicken and lamb dish and it's also great
Don't be afraid to try this place out-It's awesome!! Has great food if you like cous cous and lamb!! It's really cheap also
The service is slow but it's worth it
The Scene This sleek and understated spot in the theater district has a cool yet understated aura, with its long stainless-steel bar, dark-wood floor, shelves of illuminated terra-cotta vases, and candlelit dining room
Hard surfaces contribute to an intrusive din at peak hours
The Food Virtually every main course on this contemporary northern Italian menu sounds tempting
Begin some of the superior pastas: "Strangled Priest" (tangles of of thick pasta) in gutsy duck ragout with black olives, pumpkin ravioli with butter and sage, and gnocchi with nutty Fontina cheese
And you can't go wrong with the luscious braised-lamb shank with grilled polenta, or the sesame-coated salmon with a mild horseradish sauce
I had the prix-fixe lunch here, which was pretty good
The salad with fresh parmesean-reggiano was delicious, although the penne with scallops and calamari wasn't outstanding
The sauce was like a broth (which I was fine with), but the dish wasn't very flavorful
It really just seemed like it was lacking some kind of spice
It was fine, just not wonderful
The apple tart for dessert was a bit of a vanilla overload, as both the vanilla sauce and ice cream were REALLY strong
But the pastry itself was nice
The restaurant is quite beautiful and the service was extremely friendly
they do have a fair number of regulars who the waitstaff is particularly attentive to, which is actually just fun to watch
I really enjoyed the environment/ambiance, but I'm not sure if the food is worth going back for
The lobster salad was a fabulous starter
The lobster tail meat was freash and the flavor was delicate
Sea scallop was also delightful and flavored with butter, salt and pepper
However, if you don't like beans then you may not want to order the dish
The free range chicken was tender and also very flavorful
The warm chocolate ViceVersa cake was rich and the house chocolate cookies were very good, too
Our waiter was very friendly and helpful
Made an advance reservation for 12:00p lunch
Asked if we could get table in their outdoor garden
They said if weather nice, and if we arrived promptly for lunch, shouldn't be a problem
On the day of, we were told the garden was being painted and therefore unavailable
I don't imagine it was an emergency paint job, but realizing their garden seating is big selling point, they probably didn't want to tell us this in advance
Had prix fixe menu
Mixed salad w/parmesan was OK
Greens could have been a BIT fresher, and dressing a bit more tasty
Pork tenderloin was excellent
tasty and surprisingly moist
Standard prix fixe dessert - espresso crumb cake - awful
Essentially glorified Drake's/Hostess Crumb Cake!   While we didn't get our garden seating, the ambiance indoors was still nice, as light from the garden floods into the restaurant, making it feel very sunny and bright
I was just there last saturday with a group of 10 people and we had not just the best food but also the most amazing service
We were all extremely satisfied
The food was amazing and fairly priced
I wish ViceVersa was in Miami!
Everyone should go to this restaurant! I took clients here for dinner and was very pleased The service was amazing! This was the best dinner that I ever had  I love this place
maybe on expense acct
is best to go here
for the price the food was overrated and expensive for what was served to me
the ny steak was CHEWY and TOUGH (I had asked for medium rare, and was served medium) and presentation was diner-like (tasteless vegetables to accommodate the burnt steak), perhaps i ordered the wrong items off the menu
svc was very cold but attentive
overall not a very good experience here
SUM IT: if you must go tag along on someone else's tab
bar scene if you like to be squeezed in wait to be serve
Pleasant dining experience
The menu offerings did not excite me
We enjoyed the pasta dishes (Pumpkin ravioli, Vegie lasagna)
I found the meat and fish dishes to be just average
We were served by an attentive waiter and the restauant serves an excellent champagne (Pol Roger) by the glass
This place did not make my top ten list, but was a good jumping off point for the theatre district
My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we genuinely enjoyed ourselves! A more beautifully decorated place I have never seen! Everything from the apple martinis to the warm chocolate cake was exceptional
Our only complaint was that it was a bit too loud to fall into the romantic category (that could be in part to the large party seated next to us)
Also, the hostess was pretty frigid
The one thing that really won me over was this: the maitre'd went out of his way to return my wallet to me
Before I even knew I had lost it, he returned it to me
Thank you again! Definately recommend Vice Versa!
Viceversa was for the longest time my favorite restaurant and a real secret
I still enjoy visiting the place but the quality has definitely slipped
Portions seem to be smaller now and the taste seems to be less bold
Be forewarned that the dishes taste good because I suspect they use butter/lard galore!!! Try the strangled priest pasta with duck, calamari appetizer and roast chicken
They were all my favorites
But again, they seem to have changed a little and somehow in my last 2 visits they weren't as good as they were last year
Note to management: DON'T CHANGE WHAT WORKED!!!!!  Service is friendly, helpful and efficient
Super nice maitre'd greets you everytime
We went for Valentine's Day and loved it
Everything we had was beyond excellent (with the exception of dessert, which I would say was very good, but the main courses just blew us away) He had sea bass ravioli with pesto, I had the fontina cheese gnocci (out of this world!)
Our waiter (unfortunately I forgot his name) was fabulous
Always there when you needed him, but never hovering
The whole place had such a friendly, down-to-earth air about it (not at all stuffy), and yet everything was very top notch
As if that wasn't enough, the prices were so reasonable (for NYC)
We couldn't believe our eyes when we got the bill
Do not pass up a chance to eat here
This place is just magnificent!! The wine to the desserts are wonderful
The pumpkin ravioli are divine
The service is attentive and even the coat check girl is polite
I will spread the word and will be back
BRAVO!!!!
Oustanding food with good service
Highly recomended
Offers a very good wine list
Daniel and Franco are warm and friendly hosts, who remember their guests! I eat here at least twice a month since they have opened a couple of years ago
I highly recommend ViceVersa for business lunches and romantic evening rendezvous
Modern Italian cuisine beautifully prepared and very yummy! Try the Tortino di Carciofi e Calamari
The Pesce Spada con Carciofi Pomodorini ed Olive Nere is amazing! My usual lunch is the Spaghettini alla Chitarra con Pomodoro has the taste of Sunday dinners of my youth
Wine list is very good and the bartender makes a great Grey Goose Cosmopolitan
This place is very nice -- sophisticated, romantic, and the food is great
However, the selection of pasta dishes is rather poor for an Italian Restaurant
The coffee latte and warm chocolate cake with ice cream were fantastic
Even though I reserved the table in advance, I waited about 40 minutes

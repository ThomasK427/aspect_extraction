There bar drinks were phenmomenal and the dessert amazing
Try anything with chicken--you'll find it juicy and perfectly cooked
The fries are good too and the pasta dishes above par
Our only complaint was that in the middle of our meal the server seemed totally uninterested in us once a lady he knew entered the establishment
He focused his attention on her, completely ignoring us
However, he did apologize
I love this spot
This is still Brooklyn, so its hard to find late night dining other than diners, so this place stands out on Smith Street its the only place open late and the food is amazing and delicious, try the white sangria, its the best i have ever had
I work at night and this place keeps us night owls satisfied!
When the clock strikes midnight and you are still thinking about a place to find a decent meal
well then look to Apt 138
I have been there four times and have had tried most apps, (steak tidbits are outstanding)the Tuna Steak Special, skirt steak, the mussels, and a Paninni
The place has a friendly vibe, a great drink selection, and enough of a variety for most appetites
I have usually gone with my wife and another couple or two and no one has been dissapointed in my choice
The game room downstairs add to the fun!
We went there for brunch a few months ago when they just opened and were charmed by the setting
Beautiful bar, bright room and nice garden
But the service was terrible, the wait endless and the food random
We decided to give them a second chance so we went back this week-end
Same disappointment! I just don't understand how it can possibly take 45mn to cook scrambled eggs when the place is totally empty
And the food had clearly not improved since our first time
Don't waste your time here, there are a lot better places on Smith for brunch
This is such a fabulous restaurant! If the entrees were priced at $25 a piece it would be worth every cent----BUT they are much cheaper, between about $10-$16
I had the 5 course pre-fix for $17 and loved it! My husband had the pasta with mushroom sauce and ate every bite! Rush to this place, you will not regret it! A party of 4 or 2 is perfect because the restaurant is not big, but for 4 or less it it perfect
The food is good, but the wait staff are kids on their Spring break
Nothing professional here, just excuses for why the glasses are dirty, the food is late, and why you can't have that Coke because there are no more glasses available
Can you believe it? If you don't mind a restaurant without an ounce of front house management and kids that don't have a clue of what it means to provide good table service, you may like this place
Maybe this place will do well in some college town where the customers are the same age as the kids that serve you
This was just such a great meal when you are craving pasta
Cant wait to go back
Me and my sister love this place the food is very much like my grandma the people are very attentive and very helpfull
The best part is the price every thing is very cheep
We raccomend this place to all of our frends
For a short trip to Italy go to Pastavino
Very good food
We had their Veal and their Chicken dishes
Both were yummy
For the appetizer - eggplant and fresh mozzarella
Service was friendly and excellent
We had 3 different waiters helping us out
Would not recommend for groups larger than 4 people
We came in one day several months ago and we were completely surprised with how amazing the food was! Since then, we try to come to this really small but very romantic and quaint setting every fews weeks or so
Their calamari is delicious! we've tried both the prix-fixe dinner (goes for $17-18) as well as the individual main dishes (around ($12-$16 per plate and they even have bigger portioned plates for a few dollars more for ppl to share) There's even a back room for special occasions, which I intend to definitely use for my upcoming birthday
The servers are extremely accomodating (they know when to ask and when to leave you alone) We usually dont have to call in for reservations during the week, usually able to just walk right in even on friday nights
PastaVino is my favorite Italian restaurant in NY! This cozy restaurant located on the UES has the most delicious food service at a ridiculously reasonable price
The ambience is super cute and the service is always warm welcoming, but never overly attentive
The calamari is the best I've ever had and the spinach ravioli melts in your mouth
Fantastic wine! Every meal dining experience I've ever had there has been fantastic
My boyfriend and I loved this place
We have been twice and both times had a bottle of wine and the special- Pre-fix five course meal for $16
95
The first time we went we had the salad (great dressing), mussels in marinara (I had never had mussels and they were EXCELLENT), the Penne Vodka (mouth watering, excellent), flounder and salmon served with veggies, and desert which was simply vanilla ice cream
The staf was always filling our glasses
The second time we went we also orderd a bottle of wine
The one time my boyfriend went to fill my glass- the owner or manager actually RAN to our table to take over even though my glass was almost full
This place will be a regular spot for us
Cute little restaurant with good Italian food
The mussels appetizer was amazing
Would definitely go back
Small so not good for groups and not particularly romantic
I took my date to this restaurant and she loved it
The lighting is very good and they play happy Italian music
It's definitely a date-friendly restaurant
And the prices are good for this area
I am recommending this place to all my friends
This placed just opened and my boyfriend and I love their Calamari
It's mixed in a balsamic dressing salad
It's the perfect blend of hot calamari and a cool salad
This is our new favorite spot
The name says it all, the walls are decorated with wines
Pastavino plays wonderful music and the decor is elegant
I hope they expand the wine list
The food is really warm, with a mother's touch
Go during the weekdays as the weekends get kinda busy
The chef was brought in straight from Rome
The dishes are warm and for those who love true Italian food, this place is sure worth every penny
And the prices are excellent!
The food is worth every penny
It's one of my favorites in the Upper East Side
The homemade raviolis were divine
My boyfriend had the Pollo Chardonnay
Make sure to start with the Baked Zuchini Parm
If you can handle the wait, it's definitely worth going to
Pastavino opened up a few weeks ago near my apartment
You gotta try the Baked Zuchinni Parm
I ordered it as an app then ordered it as an entree
The host, Marcello was very gracious
the place is very,very cute and warm,the food excellent and also inexpensive
This place has only been open a month, but I had lunch there yesterday and it was awesome
So much food for such great prices
and it was only lunch! The Liguine Vognole is a must try
We will def be back for dinner soon
They have a great room in the back if you have a big group too
By far the best Italina restaraunt I have been to in that neighborhood
if you're looking for upscale decor and pampering, you might want to try another place
this place makes no fuss getting right to the point with consistently exceptional fish
no frills and no fancy pants prices
just great sushi
it could really get away with charging a lot more, but its totally reasonable prices is just one more reason samurai is my number one spot for sushi in ny
they've also got some delicious specialty rolls and some elegant appetizers

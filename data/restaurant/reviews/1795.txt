Maitre d' was horrible! After spending close to $400 on dinner, the maitre d' literally stared down his nose at us until we freed up the table for the next paying customer
I have never experienced such a lack of class from someone whom I'm sure thinks he's the creme
Our waiter was kind, but little things were missing, since we obviously weren't a certain kind of customer, like the free additionals we saw on other tables
And the portions of food were small! Either they scaled back for us, or the restaurant is scaling back in general
There are many other high-end restaurants in the city that don't feel like they need to prove themselves to such an extent
I was very disappointed, not to mention insulted
I wasn't as impressed with Babbo as other people
We tried the pasta tester's choice
I thought the dishes were pretty good
A couple were excellent and a couple I didn't like too much at all
I thought for the money I would be getting some unbelievable dishes
Our dinner for four people came to almost $400
And we only had one bottle of wine
I just thought overall, it was a lot of money for food and ambience you could get elsewhere for a lot less
I doubt I'll go back
Babbo is in my opinion the best and most innovative Italian restaurant in the city
I love all the pasta dishes
The room is warm and welcoming and the staff is great
Definitely going back for more
Make no mistake about it, the food at Babbo is great
No problem there
However, we made the mistake of showing up on time for the reservation we had to fight so hard to make
Told curtly that our table wasn't ready yet, we had to find someplace to stand
People were 2 deep at the bar, so getting a drink was not an option
We stood there, trying to stay out of the way of the servers moving through constantly to the charming front tables
Meanwhile, the people at those tables had to eat with our butts in their faces
And I haven't even mentioned the noise yet
There's good food in better atmospheres in NYC, believe me
Babbo is amazing
The food it fantastic and the service is attentive
While getting a reservation upstairs can be a pain, stopping by on Saturday night for a dinner by the window is a fun way to experience Babbo without the long term planning
The way they serve wine by the glass - with the decanter is fantastic and makes every glass special
Highly recommended, one of my favorite places!
The food is excellent but rich and somewhat pedantic: Fans of Mario's show might expect the menu to be a little more accessible w/ english descriptions of the Italian courses (they are not always offered) and more traditional fare than Lamb's tongue, Oxtail and Sweetbread! If you are an adventurous diner w/ rich tastes, then you can't beat this experience
For the rest of you, I suggest you stick w/ Mario's Food TV show
GRanted that it was 10pm, but two of the dishes were dramatically oversalted; a signature appetizer (lamb's tongue and chanterelles) had overcooked and sometimes hard mushrooms and almost non apparent tongue
Service was indifferent and inattentive
And expensive
Made rez on 2 days notice, seated promptly, 3 or 4 other tables open
First of many busboys/runners kinda tossed the amuse on table, mumbled incoherently about what it was
First of 3 servers didn't make eye contact, enunciate, smile
After the MD offered , served cocktails, barely a 3rd through when she busted out the first wine
She tried to whisk my first course away mid-bite
I made a strong back off signal, nothing rushed from that point on
2nd server bumbled description cugna , never found out another mystery ingredient that I inquired about
3rd server perfect
Pastas amazing
Other courses less amazing
Didn't like sticky sweet desserts at all
Bussers tended to stare GF's cleavage
Hey, you can't be perfect
People whine about how pricey this is, but for what you get, for a top restaurant, it's very reasonable
I will certainly be back and/or try OTTO
I have been to Babbo multiple times and always leave excited about everything I ate
Mario is The Best
He is teaching this German-Irish girl how to cook Italian (which is my favorite)
Through eating at his restaurants and watching his tv shows, I have even impressed my Italian Fiancee with some attempts at a few dishes
I even had the pleasure of speaking to Mario outside of Babbo just recently
He was very cordial to me
Thanks Mario!!
Babbo!! I feel the need to inform all, so that you don5 have to spend the ridiculous amount of money that boyfriend spent trying to celebrate out anniversary
Firstly, its too expensive, and the food is not at worth all the hype
Try Franks restuarant on 2nd avenue,the food is cheaper,and 100 hundred times better,the atmosphere is more casuall and always worth the wait,unlike Babbo
While the food was good the attitude at the door as well as the service staff was condescending and did not make you feel comfortable during your meal
The wine presentation was nice but a bit much and not authentic italian
The group was glad they had a chance to taste the food but there will not be a rush to go back
At the Bar downstairs follwing the meal and waiting for an after dinner drink we continued to wait and be ignored by the bartender
so we left and had an after dinner drink elsewhere
I have been to Babbo many times and have always had a positive experience
I'm not sure what happened to those people who posted their 1-3 ratings
Our service has only been extraordinary
I can't imagine waiting for 20 minutes to have my plates removed, given that usually the waitstaff hover around like birds of prey waiting for a fork to drop etc
My sommelier experience has always been informative and helpful
Maybe those previously disgruntled diners do not know how to communicate their tastes/desires properly
I can't imagine somebody insisting that you drink a certain wine when you do not like it! I will admit, however, that one maitre d' is particularly unhelpful and rude
Mario get rid of this guy
your food should not be marred by this guy's behavior
I have generally stuck with the tasting menus and have found them exciting and filling
I will be back!
You better be famous for good service at Babbo
It has haughty and pretentious staff and an overrated kitchen
The waitress recommended four courses, not three, given their tiny size
Orson Wells couldnt have consumed this pile of food
The sommelier talks wines better than he recommends them, pushing an overpriced Merlot after I told him I dont like merlot: No, this one is special
Not
The $80 truffles special was a sparse spreading of shavings over a heavy, saucy papparadelle
Then came the Osso Buco: dry and practically flavorless
20 minutes to clear our plates, 15 more for the bill and 20 more to sign for it
In sum, boring food, abysmal service and overpriced wines
The emperor has no clothes
Dozens of far superior dining experiences exist in this city at half the price
Dont waste your money
The taste was mediocre, though the dishes were very creative in the use of ingredients
Nice decor, but very stuffy clientele and staff
My first dining experience at Babbo was a complete catastrophe! Although the food was excellent I was horrified by the service
Unfortunately, after dropping $350 on a fabulous dinner and drinks, I was asked to leave
The reason being, after paying the bill I ordered a glass of champagne
The host actually came over to my table and told me and my date we had to leave because we already paid our bill
This occured at 11:15 p

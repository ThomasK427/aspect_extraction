Service was the WORST I've ever experienced
They refused to sit 3 out of a party of 4
It didn't matter that we had already started drinking at the bar would've ordered appetizers once seated
To sum up the evening without the details: the restaurant was too noisy, cramped to eat comfortably, or conversate, service was horrible
Totally unpleasant dining experience
After dinner we ordered dessert, drinks and coffee and were appalled that our check was brought to us before our dessert arrived
It was like, hurry up and get out!
Son Cubano was crazy! About 10 of us went on a Saturday night and it was packed
The line was full of beautiful people trying their best to woo the bouncers into getting in
It was quite a hassle getting in and the manager who was standing with the bouncer was such a jerk and so unfriendly!! They were letting in random people before us (we were first in line)
Once in though, it was a blast
Very expensive but good drinks
$40 credit minimum so bring cash! Bartender was extremely rude and asked my boyfriend for a larger tip on the drinks
Who does that? He gave him a perfectly acceptable tip
The best part of the night though - JAY Z showed up!!! It was pretty damn cool
My boyfriend and I went there for lunch last Friday
The food was very good and the decor is lovely
The valus is worth it
I have heard though that if you go on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night, it much more crowded and loud
I will definitely be going back
This place is going downhill on a fast track
It seems to get all the dregs who swarm the meatpacking district and can't get in anywhere else - the crowd has become too rowdy and cheap
The food quality has plummeted in the last few times I've gone - it seems to be assembly line preparation, overcooked, dry and not properly seasoned
Even the mojitos are off lately - and how hard is it to make a good mojito, especially if you claim to be a cuban restaurant
I've been there with a reservation and had to wait for almost 30 minutes because the manager said they we overbooked Either you have a reservation or you don't - how can they claim to be overbooked? The employees seem clueless - waitstaff can't answer questions about the food or drinks except for I'm not sure but it's all pretty good
Had a confirmed reservation through Open Table and could not get seated
They were seating people without reservations who were either friends of the employees or were slipping the hostess $20 to get seated without a reservation
If that's your scene, go and enjoy
This is the worst place in the neighborhood - all the attitude of a hot spot but doesn't have the food or service to maintain it for long
This place will be closed within a year
I recently went there for a friend's dinner party and had an amazing time
The food was pretty good, highly recommend the tapas and the mojitos are to die for
The band plays til about midnight and then the bar scene picks up
The staff is nice and the new doormen are Wow
probably one of the best looking in NY! Things have definitley changed a bit
The crowd was good looking and they are really being selective at the door, so look your best
One of my friends had a hard time getting in because of sneakers
Overall if you go there for dinner or the entertainement and excitement that ensues you're in for a treat
I had been to the restaurant for a friend's birthday and had a very nice time
Though the food was average (some dishes being better than others) overall the ambience lent itself to the occassion
I decided to call for reservations for another friend's and was laughed at for the short notice and asked if I knew what restaurant I was calling
The hostess should be dismissed for such behavior and the owner should realize that he is in business because of his clients not despite of them
You need reservations to just get in the door!!!! The staff was not friendly, not a good place for conversation seeing as how a latin band is playing music and the food is extremely over-priced!! I've had better Cuban meals that are better priced at other places
Avoid it if you can!
A bit pricey for the average to below-average food
Drinks are worth the visit though
Ambiance with live music is wonderful
We would go back, but for the drinks and music
Do not plan to dine here again
I took my husband for his birthday last night and the food was amazing! The best part of the menu was their selection of appetizers
I could have made a meal out of that
Our main course portions were very generous
We left with two doggy bags
Try the mango mojitos martini Fabulous! I would defiantly recommend it, but make reservations
The only downfall was the manager that was on that night
I felt he was rude and was less than pleasant with us
After spilling a descend amount of my drink on our table you think he would of gotten me a new one
In the restaurant business you should give your customers 110% not just a mere 100%
If you're going anytime soon (this is Jan '05), call ahead
There is renovation and the bouncers are not letting anyone into the bar without a dinner reservation, or so they told us
We were two guys with three very hot girls, so getting into places like this usually isn't a problem
Don't count on getting in if you just turn up randomly on Friday night
If you are up for a fun night this is the place to go- with its great cuban live music and fantastic atmosphere- I promise you will leave with a smile on your face
The bar makes great drinks- be sure to try the mango martini- with fresh mint leaves in it!! The entree portions are huge- I had the pork chops which were incredibly moist and tasty
Everyone else in our party enjoyed their meals as well
Be prepared to give a retinal scan when making a reservation! When I was making a reservation for a party of ten I was asked to provide photo ID, a credit card, and sign a contract
A tad excessive and inconvienient I'd say and, certainly not worth the trouble given the quality of the venue and food
I went to Son Cubano last night, waiting to have a great time, the bouncers were just out of control, mean, rude, senseless, they moved us from one side to the other, then they told us that we couldn't be there
The bouncer was bored or something, and he wanted to kick someone out
I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS HOLE AGAIN IN MY LIFE
I'M SORRY BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS GREAT, BUT THOSE GORILAS HAVE TO GO OR THE PLACE WILL BE GONE SOON! DISCRIMINATION TO LATINOS WAS PRESENT TOO! TERRIBLE!!!
Son Cubano looks small on the outside, but packs a lot of space inside
The lighting and the live music add a lot of class to the place
Great for large groups
The wine list is good
However, the food is greasey, oily, and hard
Definitely, go for the music, wine, and ambience
I had friends in town for the weekend, and wanted to really impress
Son Cubano's prix fixe for groups over 8 did the trick
For $90-we got all the wine we could drink, tons of apps, great food and service
The manager even came to check on a friend when she didn't eat her entree - she was too full from all the apps
And they personalized the menus for us
Only drawback is that it is very loud, but otherwise, everything was great
I was at Son Cubano a few months ago, and although i was only at the bar (without prior reservations which are a must), i had an awesome time
The service is excellent and the drinks were off the hook!! Also, the appetizers were to die for!!! I am taking my boyfriend there for his birthday next week, now i'll get to try the entrees
can't wait to go back
The ambience is great
and for those who were complaining about the music, well, that's what makes it even more appealing
There is nothing like having live music all night long
It is not that loud people, it's just fine the way it is
We went to the door and the bouncer said we weren't old enough (I am 26)
I told him how old I was but he didn't say anything
My friend asked how old you have to be to get in and he said 'I am looking for 25-26 year olds
' This guy was definitely not the brightest
After some wrangling to teach him how to count, we got in
I must say for my first time to visit Son Cubano it was an extraordinary experience
From the minute you walk in you are given superb, excellent service
The food was delicious, the ambience, the drinks, everyone was so pleasant
I recommend this place to everyone
My special thanks to Chris Miguel whom have excellent customer service skills, and to the entire Staff

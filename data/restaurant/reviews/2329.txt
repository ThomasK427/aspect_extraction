Not only did they welcome her, they prepared a special chicken and mushroom entree for her
I think Cafe Boulud is the best venue to experience the cuisine of Daniel Boulud
Cafe Boulud and Daniel are both exquisite restaurants (I have not been to Chef Daniel Boulud's Bistro yet)
Cafe Boulud is more laid back with a modern edge, stark, but both cost about the same
We did the tasting menu, which is by far the best way to experience this food
The chef chooses what you will taste, but you can pick what you really don't want from the menu, or what you're dying to try
You can also have the server choose the wine for each course
looong pours, so opt for the 1/2 glasses
Our server also wrote out for us what each wine was
The website is great
My wife and I spent 4 wonderful nights in NYC and while there we always indulge in the best cuisine the town has to offer
We do this on most of our trips and it is always a please in NYC
Cafe Boulud was definitely the best restaurant out of the four we dined at for dinner
The service was amazing, like watching a well choreographed dance
The food was perfect
They started us off with a tasting of a caviar dish (on the house) and then at the end after we had already finished dessert, they kept bringing different kinds of chocolates and puff pastries
We will be back!!
The beautiful decor is the frst bright spot of Cafe Boulud
I went ther for my fiancee birthday
They promptly seated us even though they had lost our reservation
I had the chilled seafood for an appetizer
It wqas OK
However the entree, sweet corn raviolli was absolutely great
A unique dish
For dessert we had the chocolate rasberry tarte and chocolate bombe
They actually gave a free chocolate souffle for her B-day
Definately a great experience
Also great $40 wine!!
Having read chef Boulud's books, I came with admiration on the New York restaurant week as a try out
At first glance, the space is very unimpressive, but I was there for food anyway
Well, I was stunned with the terrifying service, and bland food
The meal just kept going down hill as the courses progressed
And I was even more shocked that the second I put down my fork on the dessert place, one busboy right away grabbed my plate away, another busboy threw the check at the table right after
for a moment, I thought I was in China Town, but I can even say, I was treated in a much friendlier way in CT
I am really a very fair person, and dont like to complain basically, but I felt so mistreated that this is the first time I have the need to write about a restaurant
Went there twice for brunch
And both times I enjoyed it very much
Service was great, no rush
Everything was great to the last drop
It a must experience for yourself
Try it in the summer when they are on for restaurant week
At $20
00 a head, you will not be disappointed
Our waitress take our order and brought after my husband request the wine list,
That was the last time we would see her or a captain
A busboy who propose bread he could not name served me from my right with is arm brushing my nose, and no excuse
After our complaint to the Maitre d' we asked for a green tea, the busboy served us a Darjeeling, we gave up, in the middle or sipping or tea, a waiter brought a new tea service saying we vould like this better after my husband asked wich tea we where served the waiter staded Assam, altrought this time the tea was a green tea, all very disconcerting
My husband gave his card to the Maitre d' giving him the possibility to call to apologize, this never came
I hope Daniel Boulud change the way is staff receives is guest
As a person who frequents the finest restaurants in the world, the service at Cafe Boulud was absolutely deplorable
I have never been to an establishment that boasts traditional French service that basically throws food at you; waiters not only reach across the table but drip wine and water all over their diners
Daniel should really take more care in staffing if he expects to charge those prices
The experience left a more than a few things to be desired
The service and food were perfect
A truly exceptional meal
I've been two both Daniels and DB and loved it!! The food was great and the service excellent
That wasnt the case with Cafe Boulud! The restaurant was less than impressive and the staff not very considerate
When I expressed my dissatisfaction with the manager he was less than sympathetic and helpful
I do not recommend this restaurant, if you wish to try Chef Bouluds great food, skip this place and go to his other two
I certainly won't be returning to Care Boulud
For a relatively casual atmosphere, I found the restaurant week menu quite good
Portions were small but the salmon had a very rich tasting sauce
Service was courteous and they gave us 2 small samplings of other dishes
Dessert was out of this world! I would go back ONLY if they had another Restaurant Week
Since this is a French restaurant at heart, I would suggest sticking to French dishes (and French inspired dishes) on the menu
I loved the scallops I got, but my friend's Asian-style cod was devoid of any real flavor
Also, while there is a nice selection of wines by the glass, wines in the bottle quickly exceed $100, so just be aware
Finally, while the restaurant is said to request causal shic attire, and there were certainly tourists in plaid shirts and even jeans, the vast majority of men in the restaurant were wearing a jacket and tie
This restaurant is truly amazing! Every experience I have had at this restaurant has been nothing short of fabulous
Even if the items on the menu do not sound like something you would like, give it a try
You won't be disappointed
The service is great, the drinks from the bar are well made and the food is straight from heaven
This is an upscale restaurant and the crown is mostly older, but it is worth the price
Puzzling that the Upper East Side, home of so many well heeled connoisseurs,should be so devoid of great restaurants with serious food
Here is one with serious food in an easy going setting
Love Chef Andrew Carmellini's homemade gnocchi
Only thing better thatn the pastry Chef's rocky road ice cream sandwich are his sorbets
last night had white peach and cavaillon melon
Eat outside on the terrace whn it's warm but no too hot
i went for lunch, and I will admit that the scene was mostly ladies who lunch and some tourists
Its not really a restaurant for a large group
The surroundings are nice and the staff is professional
The food is what really makes this restaurant, I had duck that was so juicy and full of flavor, and an absolutely delicious dessert
They let you linger and enjoy the food, so take advantage of it
Went here for the first time recently and the food definitely met all expectations -- a spectacularly simple calamari salad; steak done to perfection and an understated chocolate and hazelnut treat afterward
Presentation was lovely and service professional, if occasionally a trifle rushed (it was understandably very busy) -- but they never let their hectic pace affect us adversely
A very pleasant experience
What a fantastic evening! We took my mother to Cafe Boulud to celebrate her 60th b-day
Our group of 7 was treated wonderfully- perfect service, delicious food and the best wine
After reading the reviews on City search, I wasn't sure what to expect from this restaurant
However, on a recent visit to NYC, I went ahead and tried Cafe Boulud, and was surprised with their outstanding food and service
The fois gras is to die for, as was the chocolate bombe dessert
My husband and I were felt like we were given special treatment all evening -- and when I asked why, the matre'd said it was our enthusiasm they enjoyed! The couple next to us was momentarily unhappy with their service and the waiters fell all over themselves to make it up to them
All and all -- a terrific restaurant
I loved Cinema Cafe
I thought the movie theme was cool, and I was most impressed by the giant menu
It had mostly diner-type food, with some more sophisticated choices (I had Cajun chicken with mango salsa and dirty rice, and it was fantastic)
My boyfriend had a sausage pizza that was also fabulous
Other options include entrees, omelettes, salads, wraps, sandwiches and more
There are also a lot of fun drinks (like peach daquiris and margaritas), but they are pricey

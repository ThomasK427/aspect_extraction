Kelley and Ping is always superb, day or night, and trust me on the pork chops
I have trouble finding a place to take our two kids out to eat in the city, until now
This place has a great kids menu that is free monday through friday
The food is smaller portions of kid friendly food, like sauce on the side, the most exotic dish is the pad thai, the rest is grilled chicken breast and rice with veggie sort of thing
Better than fast food, with the adult dinner menu being more interesting form me and my husband, and since we don't have to pay for the kids, its a great bargain
Kelley and Ping is a great place for our family to have a relaxed dinner out
Thank you Kelley and Ping
I love Kelley and Ping
I am always garaunteed fast service
The food is amazingly delicious and the servings are ample
I come here b/c I am too busy to take a long meal, but I still want a worthwhile dining experince
I usually get the special soup, or the calamari salad, which has fried calamari swiming in a sea of greens that include watercress (YUMMY)
The place is just gorgeous, with its high ceiling and lazy fans, and it is nice to know I could stay as long as I want, but when I am in SoHo, there is alot to do, still Kelley and Ping is the one place I look forward to always visiting in Soho
It's hard to find good food in a nice lookin' place that won't cost a fortune when your in SoHo
I have found a place that suits me perfectly though
I took my date to Kelley and Ping and had a great night
I went at 8:30, and had to wait 15 min for a table, but they had a bar with great homemade cocktails, drinks with ginger and mint in them, they are great
We gorged ourselves on our food
First came an appetizer combo tray that covered our whole table, it had spring rolls, dumplings, satay and more
When our entrees came, a pad thai and a korean beef dish, they each arrived served up mountain high on the plate
I love this place
My regular dinner restaurant changed the menu recently
I went in and ordered my usual steamed fish
And what I got was a delicious surprise
I called the waitress over and asked if my order was correct and she smiled and reassured
What I tasted was magnificent! Wrapped in richly hued green banana leaf was a striped bass, seasoned in chili lime garlic dressing
It was flavorful and light
I thought the old dish was good, but I would order this new, steamed fish for delivery every night if I only lived in the area
Sure Kelley and Ping knocks it out of the park with noodles, but some of their other dishes, like the fish, surpass other restaurants that specialize in fish
My friend wanted to meet me here and I looked at the reviews for noodles
I was concerned, I eat low-carb now, but in fact there are ALL of these other food options
Chicken breast no skewers in peanut sauce were nice
Also, there was this amazing beef salad that had red onion and mint, the salad had so much stuff I wish there was more lettuce, but great
My friend still ordered her usual Pad Thai, it was a mountain of noodles, she said she loved it
I was happy to find a place where we can eat different diet, at the same place
A bunch of us work around SoHo and we are always looking to find a place to meet for lunch
Eureka! This huge, open and airy space is perfect for our weekly lunch get togethers
They have lots of different foods: soups, salads, wraps and noodle dishes
For the price, you can not get a better lunch deal in the city
It is so good, I came back after work on a date for dinner, it changes, it is full service and they have a full bar with great cocktails, we had lots of pomagranite margaritas to go with our pad thai and korean beff dishes
The place is great for a date or lunch meeting with a bunch of friends
with the cooler weather I was looking for lunch and I remembered this place with all of its great soups
I love coming here it is the best
The soup are the best you can pick your own noodles and the hot and delicious perfect for the fall
And the scene is just like coming to a noodle shop in asia
Fall is soup weather and I look forward to coming back again
Whenever my parents come into town, I have to take them here
They love it
My dad likes the Lemongrass Chicken, my mom tries something different each time; this time she had a great curry dish
I am glad a place exists that we can all agree on for the price and great service, it cant be beat
kelley and ping is my favorite restaurant in soho and one of my three favorite restaurants in all of new york! not only do i eat there every time i am in soho but i make trips down to soho regularly just to eat there! there chow fun noodles in a brown sauce with chicken at lunch time are amazing as are their wraps
by far the best noodle dish in the city
and at dinner time you must start with the bug plate, b/c apetizer in it is better than the last
i've been going there since i was 10, and i am going ther tomorrow ten years, and over a hundred times later!
I had fallen in love with Kelley and Ping the very first time I came here about 7 years ago
Then I moved out of town and now I'm back!! I enjoy the the lay back atmosphere during lunch
not to mention the summer rolls and wraps in the summer and all the delicious soup noodles in the winter
I remember Kelley and Ping used to sell a variety of groceries, books and housewares
I'm just a little disappointed that Kelley and Ping's no longer selling the stuff
thank God I still have the t-shirt
It is my firm belief that Kelley and Ping has the best Pad Thai of any restaurant that I have ever tried
Not too soggy and not too dry you guys make it just right!! I also like the fact that you guys can be accommodating to children when need be
Thanks
I used the chopsticks and drank my first ever Tsingtao beer at Kelley and Ping
A year later I have still to master the art of the chopsticks but not the beer drinking
My favorites are the Tsingtao and the Singha with the Salt and Pepper Shrimp
The staff is quite well versed in the art of Tea Consumption
And I leavehere feeling cultured and refresh
I have been a diner of Kelley and Ping's delicious noodles for many years now
I am delighted to come everytime and am never dissappointed
However, I would like to make a suggestion: perhaps you guys could change up the menu a little bit for regulars like me ;-)
but DON'T take off the Tom Yum Goong Noodles!! it is my favourite!! Thanks
Kelley and Ping continues to be one of my favourites restaurants in NYC
Despite the heavy crowds I am still willing to wait, especially for that tasty Vietnamese Ravioli that you guys have
Unfortunately, you guys don't take reservations during the week
I suggest for everyone getting there a bit early
Its definately worth the wait
kelley and ping is one word is authentic
it is pure asian dining
there are no gimmicks
the people there are friendly and the food like one other user said is like home
I just wanted to say that Kelley and Ping continues to be one of my favourite restaurants
You guys have great noodles, but I guess the reason why I keep coming back is because you guys really make me feel like I am at home
Not that my home is a restaurant or anything
But you know what I mean
Keep up the good job!
I've eaten at KP twice, first time because I was shopping in Soho and was hungry, and second time to give it a second chance
The idea of an asian noodle shop in SOHO is cute, but the food is WAY overpriced, and if you ventured a few blocks south, you could have had tastier, more cultural food for a whole lot cheaper
It's been awhile since I've eaten there, but the last few times, I had a hard time reading the menu and seeing the food
Hey, I'm all for small, dark places, but it was too dim
Other than that, the food was good and the atmosphere is good
Kelley and Ping is absolutely delicious delicious noodles
I love dining here after a long day of shopping in Soho
It is a just relaxing to have a bowl of noodles and tea
I'd only wish that there could someway be an outdoor cafe version as well! But i'll take what I can get!
Kelley and Ping is definately one of the best that SoHo has to offer
I like how the ambiance changes from the cafeteria style of lunch to a sit down dinner in romantic lighting
Simply put it is a great place to enjoy great food with a fun crowd
After reading all of these great reviews posted, I was a bit disappointed
The food was decent, but for what it was really worth, should have been half the price

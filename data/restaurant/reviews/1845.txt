I had an incredible dinner there not long ago and the both of us were treated like royalty
The bone marrow is amazing
the food, atmosphere and superb staff make for one of New York City's best
There are no other words that can describe how absolutely amazing this place is
I don't think I'll ever get sick of eating here because the bone marrow appetizers and baked clams are just that good
My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The service here is also great
I love how cozy and friendly this restaurant is
Highly recommended!
oh man
this place impressed me
These types of establishments are the reasons I live in this city
Really interesting menu, but filled with items that would please anyone
I shared three appetizers, a nice bottle of wine, an entree, a dessert, and an appertif
and I paid about half as much as I thought I was going to
The food is great and the service is friendly
I would order the fried chicken entree for the greens alone
how do they cook those?! I woke up the next morning wanting to go right back (and that's saying something)
Blue Ribbon is just flat-out wonderful
It's one of the swankiest places around, with a cool vibe and a rep as THE restaurant to go after hours
It's loads of fun to sit at the raw bar and talk to the oyster shuckers while sipping your wine
You can't beat the oysters, clams, shrimp, scallops, steak tartare and paella
It's romantic for two but tons of fun with a group
I like Blue Ribbon Bakery and Sushi, but you can't beat the original
The food is really good
The GM is cool and they totally handle to overflow of demand
It is tough to get a table
Try putting your name down and then doing next door to 203 Spring for a drink first
The food had great texture and the fish was fabolous and fresh
Two thumbs up
I got into town a little late (2am) and had to find a place to eat
now I know why NY is such a great city
I mean, are you kidding me?? This spot was awesome
Great service, outstanding quality food and wine menu, super deserts
and great crowd
Just enough of an edge to let you know youare in NYC, but none of the trouble with a hot restaurant
Highly recommended
even if it's not late night!
theres really no need for me to add another review because this is simply the best restaurant for several reasons
the customer services is hands down the BEST
They make a perfect cosmo, as im sure everyone will agree with me
the decor and atmosphere creates a comfortable but elegant and distinct environment for dining
this place is the nyc's famous come as you are sort of restaurant
there are people in jeans/sneakers chatting up a storm with business suits all because thanks to the love of great food
bone marrow is a must have as is their lamb chops
Blue Ribbon is a must try! I recommend the the royale for a party of 3 to 4! The bone marrow is a different but delicious appetizer as well as the pu pu platter
Another delicious entree is the paella which is absoulutely delicious! For dessert try the chocolate bruno if you can still fit anything in!
A place that treats everyone like a king
Food is beyond marvelous
Dining late never felt this good
A horde of experts at your disposable serving up dishes beyond you're wildest dreams
One of my favorite places!! So many great things I 'don't even know where to start
Great beer selection
Plateau a must
Also the fried oysters
The escargot is to die for
I've never had anything like them
Also the bone marrow is spectacular
Desserts not worth the hassle
Hands down best late night dining in New York
Hesitate to write this because it will just add to the wait
Service, food, ambience, scene
perfection
Very downtown crowd, mood
The place is dark and loud
But this adds to it's charm
Food is outstanding
The wait is interesting rather than annoying
We saw P Diddy waltz in and out to put his name on the waiting list and then come back 30 minutes later to eat with his companion
(I guess they don't play favorites here!)
The wait can be annoying and the less-than-expert bartender doesn't help, but the food really is excellent
It's casual enough to be the only restaurant that serves food at this level with so little pretension
Perfectly comfortable for jeans, but nice enough for a special dinner
The focus is really on the food and it shows
The daily special sea scallops with cauliflower puree were literally PERFECT
Foie gras terrine w/ challah bread = excellent combination
Catfish is a little more heavy-handed, but good comfort food
I just hope the Upper-East-Side meatballs don't invade this little treasure more than they have
Had the special Arctic Char was cooked perfectly
Tried the Bone Marrow after reading so much about it, didnt find anything special with that dish quite oily in fact
Fried oysters were good
the foie gras was good spreaded on the bread
Will definatly go here again
Give it a try if you havent already
This is by far the one of the best restaurants in the city
Food is great, service is top notch, no attitude, very relaxed
what can one say? everyone loves this place
but bone marrow? one would think people would be turned off, but if you like food (my tummy proves it!), this was superb
the whole menu was fab, so hard to choose
appeteasers they are, the lamb was succulent, desserts sinful
go in 4's so you can try variety - do share (who said this is tacky?!)
do make reservations (early is better unless you like crowds) expect to wait n wait n wait
forget driving, train/cab it
SUM IT: nothing I can say that hasn't been echoed repeatedly already
If my budget allowed me (or is it my big tummy), I would eat there weekly!
Hands down one of the best dining experiences in NYC
I make it a point to go there at least twice a month and every time I'm reminded how truly exceptional the food and service is
The raw bar, the seafood, the grilled sardines, the bone marrow, the rack of lamb - I could go on and on
The service is attentive and gracious
Superlative in every way
The only drawback - be prepared to wait if you're there at prime time most every night

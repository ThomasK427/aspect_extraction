I have enjoyed dining at Cafe Joul since it first opened
The food is fresh, delicious and consistently wonderful
The staff is always friendly and welcoming
This is a gem in the neighborhood
This is one of our main go to restaurants whether we have friends in from out of town, or want a quiet enjoyable delicious meal for just the two of us
We have gotten to know the husband/wife team that run the restaurant, and love the food and the wine list
The service is great too
A real find for us
I have lived near Cafe Joul for 5 years and this place has always been special
I went there as it just opened and getting on its feet, and while it has become more established, it hasn't lost its home-y neighbourhood feel
The service has always been consistently good, with attentive, friendly waitstaff
The wild mushroon ravioli, croque monsieur (at lunch) and even the burgers/fries (which in spite of my lion appetite I can never finish) are wonderful
On 9/11 this place was the ONLY place in the neighbourhood that stayed open, and not only was at its peak service at max capacity, but also donated all its profits that evening to the WTC victims
Even though I have been there many times, I just went back last night and finally thought to write this review!
I really don't care for the upper east side, so if I have to go up there, I reward myself with cafe joul
It is a little gem, bright and cheery with the most up beat, friendly and adorable waitresses
The food is MAGNIFICENT, all the wonders of french cuisine without being to heavy
how they do it, I don't know, I don't care, as long as they keep feeding my their sweet delights!
I hardly ever venture above 14th Street for food
but this little bistro is well worth the trek uptown
The food is amazing for the price
The best burger in town
hands down! Also- try the seafood cassoulet, so very tasty
They have a very friendly waitstaff they show black white movies on Friday Saturday nights
Great little spot for a date
Cafe Joul is the perfect blend of fine food and romantic ambiance
This is the ideal date restaurant when you want to impress the girl/guy of your dreams
While the food is the real star of this beautifully appointed cafe, so are you as a guest of Cafe Joul with the most attentive and friendly waitstaff in the area
The prices are most reasonable and the value is as they say, ginormous! The desserts are divine and decadent and not to be missed
In one word, Yum!
have been there a couple of times
excellent food
tasty tasty steaks
great deserts
service, i would say has been not good
changed waiters on us and they both seemed too busy/tired/unattentive
this one has potential! A casual, relaxing atmosphere makes this a very enjoyable experience
While it was our first time there, and we only had salad and two entrees, the menu is diverse enough to make you want to come back and sample more
The burger was great but a pork tenderloin dish was only passable (sauce was bland
) However, the couple next to us were commenting about outstanding mussels and the chicken dish looked appealing
Given the excellent, friendly service and a broader menu than most bistros, we'll definitely try it again
I live 3 blocks from this place and sometimes that seems like too much! The food was outstanding, the service was kind, attentive, and knowledgeable and the space is too romantic to convey in this space
Well-priced, great tasting dishes will send you back for a second taste
Try the cheeses and desserts the first time around, great liquor list to boot
I have never been disappointed at Cafe Joul
You are certain to find fresh, high quality food here
The neighborhood keeps this place a secret, so I've heard; they don't want outsiders taking their tables
I'll happily spread the word though
Try the mussels or goat cheese pizza salad
Daily fish specials are always delicious
Best cassoulet I've had outside of Toulouse too!
I had the pleasure of dining at Cafe Joul recently and had a wonderful time
The service was friendly and the food was delicately flavored and the taste shone through
No trip would be complete without sampling the flourless chocolate cake!
The French bistro fare is far better than most three and four star restaurants around town
And half the price!! Service is always friendly and efficient
The ambiance IS romantic and downtown casual
Wine list is well-selected with many good values
We had a wonderful holiday party here and it quickly became a favorite of our guests
Charming atmosphere that seats probably no moroe than 35
Outstanding menu with specials that make you eager to come back and try more selections
yes this place has good pizza but HORRIFIC HORRIFIC delivery service
i waited an hour for my pizza to come and then finally called to find out where it was
i was told it was still being made and that they were busy
5 minutes later the delivery man is downstairs with an ICE COLD pizza
they had obviously forgotten to deliver it and my call reminded them
terrible terrible awful customer service
Great salads and brick-oven pizzas, along with other Italian pasta, meat, chicken and seafood dishes in a casual, relaxed atmosphere with friendly service
And, the best news of all is that you'll get quality, tasty dishes without getting a bill that knocks your socks off! A neat neighborhood place!
In Short This Chinese restaurant has proven so popular, it's spawned multiple outposts, this one in east midtown
Decor varies from location to location, with photos of Mao Tse-Tung making occasional appearances
Menus also vary, though most break down into Sichuan, Hunan, and "American Chinese Food" sections
Sichuan should be the main draw, obviously, with basics like smoked tea duck and double cooked pork available alongside more intriguing dishes like sliced conch and "Bad Smell Bean Curd
"
We tried the Grand Sichuan in the village a few weeks ago
This one did not even come close
Service wasn't great either
I guess the restaurant was pretty empty -- for a good reason
I cannot believe food under the same grand sichuan chain could differ by so much
I just dont understand
The menu looked the same but the food here was far below average, and service was below average, to say the least
The beef which we ordered was stale and flaky
Yes, flaky??!! It must be frozen for a long long time
This is definitely the worse chinese food i have ever had in my life!! Of the 4 grand sichuans in the city which we tried this is by far the worse (and by a large margin)
STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT
If you want good sichuan, the one in chelsea is still the best -- but expect a long wait for the table
Despite, its rather grungy exterior, Rice Bowl is the perfect place to assuage those hunger pangs on the cheap and fast
The interior is all light and clean, with efficient, kindly people behind the counter and customers sitting around chatting or reading as they nosh
The sushi's pretty decent and my favorite dishes are the spicy pork rice bowl and a side order of chicken wings
I haven't tried the salads or soups but have heard they hit the spot as well
I had a really nice smoothie here the other day, although it wasn't anything I would go out of my way for
They don't take cash and the smoothies were very similar to Jamba Juice's
I also wasn't crazy about the fact that almost all of them use sorbet (I prefer lowfat/nonfat yogurt)
But if you're around, the smoothie was tasty and the staff is all very friendly
It's really just a nice neighborhood smoothie/juice bar
NYC needs more places like this
It's super clean and the staff is great
I love the drinks and the sandwiches and soups are delicious too
Keep it up!!
I recently discovered Juice Generation on West 72nd Street near the park

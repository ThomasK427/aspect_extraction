Duck, cheese, pasta, venison, octopus
every plate was something completely innovative, with a flavor that failed to disappoint
We dropped almost $200/head
and even then I would rate this as a great value
Get reservations (recommended a month in advance) and prepare to be in for a treat! The food and the staff well exceeded my already high expectations
I cannot understand the frustration with not being able to get a reservation
When you call, they ask you to make a reservation one month in advance
do that! I did and I was treated like royalty
They can't help it if they are small
The service was over the top outstanding
Our server knew it all! Wow
The food was ridiculously good
We got the pasting tasting menu
It was the highlight! The wine was fabulous, too
The dessert, well, wow
Our bill was pricy
We spend $300 for the two of us
But for a speical occassion, it was worth it
I would call this a good value
My issues with Babbo: (1) You must make a dinner reservation one month in advance (for a Thursday dinner, nonetheless) (2) The host/hostess were curt and rude (3) There is no room to wait at the bar (limited seating, standing on top of other diners) (4) Waiters/Hosts were enamored with the fact that Gwynneth Paltrow and mom Blythe Danner were dining there (5) Upstairs -- temperature was very hot and stuffy (we requested downstairs seating instead, where it was much cooler) (6) Music -- Terrible! Loud and raucous and very irritating -- they also played Nirvana (loud) -- highly unusual and inappropriate for a place as nice as Babbo  My Compliments of Babbo: (1) Bartenders knew their stuff -- recommended good wines (2) Bus boys were very good at filling water glasses, providing bread, offering assistance, cleaning (3) Waiter was able to recommend good dishes for my wife and I to share (4) Food was quite good -- appetizers: we had the grilled artichokes (special) and the grilled octopus -- both tender and tasty; pasta: we shared the black spaghetti w/ rock shrimp -- big portion, also very tasty and spicy, but the pasta could have been cooked a little more (less than al dente); dinner: we shared the lamb chops, which were HUGE and DELICIOUS; desert: we shared the upside down cherry cake, which was also quite light and tasty (5) Prices were reasonable -- i was surprised at how not egregious the prices were -- maybe i'm affected by all of the pricey NYC restaurants, but this wasn't as expensive as I thought it was going to be  All in all -- food was very good, but the ambiance/experience was less than desirable -- there are many other italian restaurants that i would recommend way ahead of Babbo
We were at Babbo last night and I have to say we were shocked at the rudeness of the front desk peoplean older gentleman with reading glasses and a woman who looked very unhappy
We could not get a reservation, but we were told by the reservationist that they have open seating for a few tables and we would be welcome to come and wait at the bar for a table
As a result, we went to Babbo transcript follows   Us: Hi
How are you? We do not have a reservation, but we wanted to see if we could get a table for two? Man with Reading Glasses: Well, it is going to be at least an hour and half wait and if you leave the restaurant you will loose your reservation [the gentlemans second in command stood next to him silent with stiff crossed arms] Us: Okay, well we can wait  Man with reading Glasses: Fine, name? Us: XXXXX  This was not what you would expect when you are about to drop a few hundred dollars on dinner
The behavior of the front desk people define the saying a few bad apples spoil the bunch
Although, we were seated within an hour, the bartender and waiter were very nice and the food was good (although my pork was too salty) we would not return
We like going to restaurants where we feel welcome rather than a place that thinks they should charge admission
Good food in the past - however, we ate here last night and it was AWFUL - the 'special' soft shell crabs were so salty they actually tasted like bad dry chinese with too much MSG - the black pasta was literally not cooked (we're not talking al dente - we're literally talking hard and dry) - and the bad sound system with awful repeating rock music made the evening for one where every sense was offended
The wine however was delightful, but even that was not enough to drown down the food or drown out the music
Booked a 10:30pm Sat
nite seating for two a month in advance
Entered restaurant at 10:30pm and had to wait ten minutes before seating
There is NO waiting area - waiters, diners,and staff all converge in a tight space
The expensive appetizers - fresh anchovies and grilled octopus - portions are small
Particularly the three strips of halved anchovies tasted as salty as canned anchovies - cannot distinguish the difference
The main courses - Whole Grilled Branzino and Jumbo Shrimps - were not extraordinary
The Branzino (sea bass) was relatively bland
The shrimps were overloaded with salt - this voided any fresh seafood taste
At 11pm, the music went from soft romantic to loud mettallic rock
Killed the dining experience
I will never come back to this farce of a restaurant
I advise all potential diners to beware of the over-inflated reviews of this place
Don't question yourself why I have been so ruff on this ! Was very disappointing and that's all I have to say
Warm dishes came out cold,very expensive and not too much excitement to talk about it
And I was NOT In a bad mood at all,just in case you have to criticize me for this
Just went there for dinner on Friday night, after my boyfriend spent several weeks trying to track down a Friday res
The $350 dinner for two was very disappointing
Although the service was top notch, all of the food was disappointing: burnt octopus, bland ravioli, odd tasting mint love letters
And everybody at the restaurant seemed have come to the city from New Jersey to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary
My guess is that Mario is focusing on his new 10,000 pound gorilla, Del Posto, and has left the also-rans in charge of the kitchen here
Too bad; this place used to be tops
My parents came into the City for their anniversary,  so I thought taking them to Babbo would be a good idea
Alas, it was not
The food fell far below our expectations, and the menu was rather limited
If you like to try new flavors, including one dish that was actually 'intestines' I was told
you may enjoy Babbo
I left feeling hungry
Certainly, I thought 'Molto Mario' would have come up with more flavorful dishes at this 'way overpriced' restaurant
I went to Babbo with my boyfriend, expecting exquisite food with exemplary service, and received the complete opposite in return
I managed to get the last reservation at 11:15pm during the week, and, upon entering the restaurant, my boyfriend and I were seated next to each other, hardly a romantic atmosphere! None of the items on the menu (all in Italian) were explained to us! You need to be fluent in Italian to be able to decipher the menu
The music was loud and blaring dance music, the opposite of what a romantic atmosphere should be like
The waitress was rude, the bread hard and cold, like the overall service and atmosphere
For ridiculous prices, you get nothing!!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I RETURN TO BABBO! What a complete letdown to Manhattanites
Next stop, Dominoes
Wow
I didnt know that this was how real pasta is suppose to taste
We ordered the $75 Pasta tasting menu, which was the best pasta I have ever had
All Italian cruisine chefs should learn from Babbo! The texture in every pasta dish was perfect
only one pasta was slightly too salty, but all others were fragrant delicious
The atmosphere was intimate while the service was friendly knowledgable
I really enjoyed Babbo, and i typically dont like Italian food
As long as it's a special occassion
GO
The food was wonderful
Pigs feet, pasta, veal all excellent
Service was a bit off unless you were a regular i think
Table next to mine ordered a lot of wine and everyone fussed over them
My partner and i ordered a few glasses and were treated with a bit of indifference
Loved the food however and the energy of the place was the highlite
This was a truly one of a kind, amazing experience
The service is absolutely phenomenal
The waiter knew everything about the food and was extremely helpful and courteous
The food is out of this world
The beef cheek ravioli are delicious as are the oxtail gnocchi
The cheese tasting had some very interesting choices
I found the hard cheeses to be better than the soft cheeses
The lamb chops can be spotty - sometimes truly outstanding, and sometimes just average
The upstairs bathroom wasnt perfectly clean, but otherwise, the experience was perfect
It was also half the price of a similar meal at Il Mulino
This was the best restaurant I have ever visited in my life
I took my fiancee to Babbo to propose to her, and the everything could not have ben more perfect
The ambience is amazingly beautiful, the enire restaurant was filled with cherry blossoms
The waiters were well knowledged to the menu and the wine selection, and the food was impeccable
This is one of the finest restaurants in all of NY
Babbo is the best restaurant Ive ever eaten at
Ive had the pleasure of dining there about a dozen times over the past two years
I find the food brilliant, bold, playful and many times sublime
The branzino with lemon jam, lamb chops, goose liver ravioli, spaghetti with salami and chili, duck with cherries, and the grilled octopus with balsamic vinegar have all been steller dishes
The atmosphere is jovial, bustling and relaxing
I love dropping in early by myself so that I can sit at the bar

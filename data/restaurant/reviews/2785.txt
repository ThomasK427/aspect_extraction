The prices are reasonable
I have been here several times and everyone had enjoyed themselves
I highly recommend this restaurant
The crust has a touch of garlic taste
The combination of ingredients is awsome with a near perfect blend and not too much of any one ingredient
I have had a life long relationship with their pizza and I recommend that you give it a try
Best square pies out there
Granted there regular slice is what you expect from a Brooklyn pizza joint but there sicilian squares are too die for
Personally, that is all I order from there there other food is good but their squares are to die for
A nice thick, cheesy, saucy slice that is always cooked well enough
Only a rival that sells spumoni and cooks a totally different sicilian square may be better
It will leave you full! Not to mention the old man (owner) at the table who is always good for a laugh
He might even call you by the wrong name after just meeting you
The restaurant part of this place is actually good! Was surprised by the versatile menu selections considering its really a pizza parlor
Tasty and reasonably priced
One bad thing
Altho the neighborhood has become largely Russian, they should at least have a waitress who speaks english well enough to be understood
Try the Grandma pizza
This restaurant is a perfect 10! The service was fast and friendly, the price was unbelievable!! 2 people can eat for $18, and you get huge portions!! That included Salad, wgich by the way was the best salad ever! You get Pasta, enough for 3 people, and  an entree again enough for 3! All the food was fresh and homemade, Nice Italian cuisine, just like being at mom's on a Sunday afternoon! I highly recommend this restaurant
Its not a romantic atmosphere, and maybe not appropriate for a first date, but its great for the family and friends who want good Italian food and great friendly service- and like I said the price is unbelievable!!
This pizza place is right in my backyard
It's not a very good place to eat pizza, but i like their burgars and fries
They are mainly open for the students who go to kingsboughrough
I don't recomend going there, unless your close by, the foods not that good
Plus, i would also like to mention the prices, they are way too expensive
they raise them every year, last year it was $1
50 a slice now its $1
75, its more like run and go pizza for people, i don't like spending nearly $2
00 for pizza, i might as well buy some good pizza in a restaurant
The pizza is good
The employees are very gregarious
The ambience is cute
Its a great place if you are on the go and not wanting to really sit down
If you haven't tried pizza here you don't know what a real pizza is!!!! The moment you put a piece of pizza Alfredo in your mouth - you think you don't need anything else in your life!
always excellent pizza, good service, selection, worth waiting in line behind a bunch of teenagers
Your first slice is before you have teeth
Mom wheels you over in the stroller, and you gum it down
From that moment on your hooked
You grow up riding the subway but never are hungry when you get home
This is a pizza that for as many years as I can remember never delivered
( I hear they do now) But they never needed to
The cars would always be blocking the bus stop in all kinds of weather
The smell takes over your life, you know that no matter where you go on this earth you will always come back and seek out Bay Pizza!
This is not a restaurant or ice cream place
They are a comic/video game place that sells ps2, xbox, gamecube, n64, sega genesis, super nintedo, ps1, and dreamcast
Ill give a review on there video games
I went there to see if I wanted to buy a game so I told him to put in a game so I can see how it looks like and test it out
What he does is put in the game and wont allowed me to test it out and starts playing it himself
When i ask to try it out he said no and I have to buy it first
Also they are expensive
Go other places to buy your games and comic
Not friendly there also
My boyfriend
well ex-boyfriend now introduced me to those wings, and they are really delicious
I shared them with members of my family and everyone wanted to know where I got them from, well I asked him and he never would tell me, he acted like it was a secret, not anymore I found a receipt and now I can get my own wings
They are truly the best wings I've ever tasted
I wish the Wing Wagon continued success
They have the best BBQ Buffalo wings!!! I stop by there every now and then when I go into Brooklyn
they have very good food, fast service and the people are extremely nice!!!
The Wing Wagon has become a staple in my life
A true buffalo wing house in Park Slope is hard to come by, and was pleased to find this gem on Flatbush
The service is extremely fast, the wings are amazing, and the prices are very reasonable
The only downside is that they don't have a delivery service, which makes getting wings in the colder months a hassle
But all in all, it's worth the trip
Man this is one amazing Pattie! Deffinitely a must stop by when I'm in the area
Brooklyn's lesser known little gems
Christie's, a hole-in-the-wall occupying a tiny corner of Flatbush and Sterling, has been here forever
Consistently, year in and year out, the bakers here produce the best beef, chicken, jerk, and veggie patties I've tasted in NYC
Order a patty inside fresh coco bread and you have a filling lunch for $1
75!
Walk by early in the morning and the wonderful aroma on the street will stop you in your tracks
Right next to the Q stop, the store front may not be $1 million design, but it is pleasant and inviting
There are two seats, but it is really for takeout
What amazing baked goods, from brownies, to cookies, to fluffly criossants and other wonderful baked goods
Anyone stopping in for a cookie will be overwhelmed with the delicate balance of flavors and the soft centers and crispy edges
A true treat! Check it out!!!
This is the most wonderful little bake shop
Fabulous cookies
Better than any I could make at home
Great brownies
Beautiful muffins
I'm addicted
and can feel the pounds coming on already
Plus, it's sooooo cheap
They could charge double and still be underpriced
If you're in the neighborhood, stop in
You won't be sorry
After asking the server explicitly if a soup had sour cream or cheese in it and getting is reassurances that it had neither, I ordered the soup
It came with cheese on top
When I asked him if what i saw was infact cheese, he said No
It's cream cheese
Hmmm
isn't that CHEESE???   The food took forever to arrive and did not taste good at all
All the tables around us got bread as they waited for their food
We did not
I had to ask for the check 3 times
This place is not worth it
Try the Spanish restaurant down the street on Park and Flatbush
It's not fancy and does not pretend to be, but you get great food at great prices
The New Prospect Cafe pretends to be fancy and the prices indicate fancy, but the food is mediocre at best and the service is terrible

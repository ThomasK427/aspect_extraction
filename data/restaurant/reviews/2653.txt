Always have table for big group
Not impress with decor, but call for takeout
Esp if you have a party
not a place to bring a date, but for the price the place is great service is great to
This menu is very broad with many choices
I was excited to have so many options
However, after eating there, I think it would be in the restaurants best interest to limit the menu and improve in one area
The menu is not accurate, they substitute without mention and I thought the food was horrible
Yes, the food is a bit pricey
But if you don't expect to pay a bit more when dining in Carnegie Hill, thenyou're not familiar with the neighborhood
Eating on a clean, quite section of MAdison, where the restaurants can open their doors and not give the feeling of sitting by the Westside Highway is a bonmus in itself
Moreover, you pay for the dependability and quality of thses small restaurants
The dishes do not push the envelope of creative cuisine, but they are almost always plate-cleaningly delicious
Seafood is fresh, service is always prompt, the atmosphere is quiet and personable- allowing you to actually talk AND hear the responses
I would gladly pay a few dollars more for this than trying the newest, loudest Park Ave So hotspot, or LES overpriced bistro/panneria/tapas/fusion joint
But then again, the latter is also fun at the right time
Wonderful food, huge menu for its size, a littel cramped but always warm and welcoming
The best in the neighborhood
In Short Elaine's has been made famous by its regulars who come for conversation and the homey, old-Italian-neighborhood feel
Sparkling lights set the mood as the crowd dines on mediocre grub
Elaine makes a fuss over faces she recognizes, even if they aren't with Woody's party
If she doesn't recognize you, you'll end up seated somewhere in Siberia
People seem to like to dump on this place
Don't quite understand why - as I've found the food to be perfectly fine
Not fine as in fine dining - but fine for a decent meal at a fair price
I wouldn't know Elaine if she ran over me - and frankly don't care
It's where I go when I'm in the neib
I moved to New York 5 years ago, to start out at NYU
My recollection of Elaine's was then only of the movie Manhattan by Woody Allen
I went to Elaines on a whim to try it out
It was everything I have heard and read about
I finally felt like I was in a real New York place
not some 20 something bridge and tunnel like hotspot
I am now by no means a regular, ( at my age I can't afford that)
but I consider Elaine's as where I will go anytime I need a treat, a good meal, a good time , and a great environment
The mussells and baked clams are amazing and the Cabernet is delicious
Elaine's truly outlasted being trendy by decades
it will always be a great place to spend your evening
excellent taste at a reasonable price
Excellent atmosphere, typical neighborhood NY, where the locals may go
No problem with a front/window table
Excellent service
Celebs visible
Elaine herself
fair
and the same scene plays night after night
I hadn't been there in months, and stopped by recently with an out of town friend who just HAD to see for herself
In a way it's sad to see so many folks just hang around the bar hoping to be noticed by a celeb
I have, on occasion, been there with 'someone' and seated at a front table, and that can be fun, but once in a great while is plenty for me
The food is average, at best (I have been repeatedly underwhelmed by the mediocre fare) and the service is only good if Elaine is within range
There are two types at Elaines: the celebs, who go because of Elaine, and the wannabees who go for the celebs
More movie than restaurant
I have avoided this place for decades because of the phoney crowd including Elaine herself
But if you go before 8'oclock especially on mon
or tues
you can get a pretty good meal at a fair price
And you may even get a widow table without earings or dressing like a star in men in black 2
This is a great quick stop cafe
Good selection, good prices and fresh, homemade foods
I think the food and drinks are fine, but the past two times I've been here I've been basically shoved out by the manager
The first time, my friends and I had eaten dinner and then had just got a pitcher of sangria literally minutes before our table started getting stalked by the manager and our waitress
Eventually he asked us to take it to the bar b/c he had other customers waiting - mind you we had waited an hour for the seat ourselves
The following time, we kept ordering drinks and appetizers, and the same manager kept leering over our table asking if we were ready for our check
I would understand that if we had been loitering or obnoxious, but this is definitely the first time I have been rushed out as a quiet customer who just kept raking up the bill
For a quick drink before you go somewhere, I reccomend it - but for a relaxing evening, steer clear b/c that manager is a total tool
Im always amazed at the lack of variety on the menu at this place, but, as the neighborhood spot for excellent margaritas, it does its job admirably
My favorite is the frozen raspberry margarita
Food-wise, stick with the fajitas (the steak fajitas are very good)
The black bean soup is mediocre, at best, but the chips and salsa are really good
However, since this isnt gourmet Mexican food, its hard to justify the price of some of the entrees
Any restaurant can suck on any night of the week so I would not respect the negative reviews unless someone is describing a miserable experience
I've been here twice and have ordered delivery once and so far I haven't had reason to avoid the place
The atmosphere isn't fratty at all, but who knows--anything can happen on any night of the week
The habanero wings are very good, the nachos are very good, the nicoise salad is good, the flank steak is good, the sangria i had last week was a little watered down, the service was pretty good
Margaritas out of a machine? And they weren't very tasty at that
They did, however, do the trick - quite potent! I've been to Cilantro twice
I went back because the Chile Rellenos I had the first time were fabulous - one stuffed with herbed cheese, the other with picadillo (pork)
But the second time (when I stuck to beer and avoided the slurpee margaritas) they weren't so tasty so I probably won't return
Also, kinda cheesy atmosphere on the 2nd Ave
location considering the menu is quite eclectic and even the chips are an upscale combo of taro, plantain, etc
chips
The Steak Fajitas are awsome
On monday nights if you there befor 7pm Half price margarita
And Mondays fajita are half price all night
The staff is rude and the owner is one of the biggest jerks I have ever met
The previous review had it right--if you don't like Mexican food perhaps Cilantro is the place for you
Otherwise, you can do much better
The menu is far too ambitious for the obviously limited capabilities of the kitchen, which would be better served sticking to basics; the very young clientele would probably prefer that anyway
The outdoor seating is nice, especially given the ear-shattering sound level emanating from the fresh out of college crowd drinking inside
Coming from a person who's not a big fan of Mexican food, I can say that I really like Cilantro
First, happy hour - 1/2 price margaritas - strong and tasty
Then the steak fajitas are absolutely fantastic - juicy and large portion - and 1/2 price on Monday nights (comes to about $7
50)
I've had other stuff there too and its all pretty good
I thought the food was pretty lousy, actually
The sangria is great though
Maybe if you drink enough of it the food gets better!
Cilantro is a great restaurant
The food is excellent, especially the Ceviche, and the black angus fajitas
You can not leave Cilantro's without trying the Margarita's on the specials menu

By the way, a lot of ppl rec BR's bone marrow dish
Their sweet bread was good
Overall, my friends and i had a delectable time
I would definitely come back here
It's expensive, but not outrageous
Despite of the nice menu and the name bakkery, there is only one choice of sweet dish for brunch: French toasts
I ordered the plain ones but, unfortunatelly, they were not as good as expected: heavy, too sweet and dry
What a disappointment for a french toast lover !
The food is typical, but glorified
The ambience is quite nice however
The seating downstairs is very very nice as well - one can actually smell the fresh scent of baked bread while eating there - since the kitchen is right there in almost plain view
Service was alright - not too bad but one wishes that the wait staff could be a tad bit more friendly
I've been here several times for Sunday brunch now - (note: it helps if you're a late riser as I find the wait is always reasonable if you show up after 3pm)
The food is always tasty and extremely filling
Great bread and coffee too
A little expensive, but the neighbourhood is charming
The downstairs is great for groups
Finally got to try this place when my parents were in from out of town
I was surprised at the old style basement and the noise level! While quite loud, the food is superb; Had the shrimp with garlic butter, and the goat cheese salad - both excellent and served by a team of very attentive waitstaff
I will definitely come back here whenever I can afford it - totally recommend the basement for a party or groups who want to talk the night away and the main floor for a romantic date
After taking an out of town friend for a tour of the city, we looked around for a menu with choices for picky eaters
After being disappointed with the wait at another area restaurant, we found Blue Ribbon
I had heard it was good, but was afraid of a wait and hefty prices
I was pleasantly surprised to find there wasn't a wait, the prices were not too much and the bread they give you at the table was delicious! I will definitely be back
Okay
$7 for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a chocolate and peanut butter brownie???? If it was outstanding I could see it as a nice change for lunch, but the peanut butter wasn't any better than one you could buy at any grocery store and the chocolate peanut butter brownie was horrible
so bland! I thought maybe I was mistaken and had a co-worker try the brownie and we couldn't even finish it! My advice
save your money! If you have a taste for a PB J , make it at home
It will be 10 times better than anything they could've made
I've actually had dreams about the chicken salad sandwich on (freshbaked) country sourdough bread with jarlsberg cheese
Especially on a hot day, the downstairs feels like a cool, candlelit castle - and they'll keep the iced tea coming
They aren't kidding with the name - the fresh baked bliss they create can even be picked up on the way out to stock your own kitchen
highly reccommended
get lots of small plates and share
i also once reserved the private wine room downstairs for a party and it was fabulous
i went to dine here a few times, and every time i felt the food was better
the prices are kinda steep for a college student, but once you get the dessert, it's worht every penny
i would like to recommend either of the bread puddings for dessert
you won't regret it
it seriously melts in your mouth
The food here is great and the service is all right
We saw the waitress twice - once to tell us the night's specials and once to take our order
What am I tipping for again? The noise level is WAY too high
Imagine Times Sq at rush hour and then enclose it in a 20 x 20 room and you have this place
Guests shouldn't have to scream at each other across the table to have a intimate conversation
People got up and left while we were there because of the noise, it's THAT loud
It will be a while for a return trip from me unless I bring my earplugs and bullhorn
The first two choices of wine wasn't in stock
We finally got one recommended
It was okay
The waiter ended up charging us for the wrong wine
I got the herring in cream
It was okay
Tasted like the ones you get in a jar
They probably did get it in jar
That's what happens when you have too much on the menu
You start cutting corners with the trips to the gourmet store
I ordered the $27 filet mignon medium rare and got it well done
I returned it and got a flurry of apologies
When it finally arrived, it tasted too rich
I don't like it when restaurants drown their food in butter or fat as they cook it
The potato pancake was overcooked
I wouldn't go back to this place
The space was cramped, the server was slow and seemed almost annoyed that our group of 7 was even in the restaurant
The foie gras was decent, but the desserts, especially the Banana Walnut Bread Pudding, were great
Full disclosure
I love the original Blue Ribbon restaurant
Unfortunately, this place pales in comparison
Sure the breads are great, and the menu extensive, but in general the preparation is fairly boring and the taste mediocre
Thankfully, brunch is much better
Of course, good luck trying to get a seat
This place is packed on the weekends
They only take reservations for parties of five or more
Other pluses, cozy and romantic seating downstairs, an attractive dining room upstairs with wide open windows, a decent selection of wines by the glass and the fresh breads they make on premises
This place has good cooked Japanese style food, although it is not exactly authentic
I have never had the sushi, but I hear its very fresh
My one complaint is that the tiny restaurant often smells fishy, which I do not find appetizing
I usually get delivery
They were very rude when I returned my Salmon Teriyaki, which was obvious to me upon my first bite, horrible and old
The salmon was clearly far from fresh and down right rotten
They exclaimed that it was impossible that it was bad, talked amongst themselves in Korean (not Japanese) and gave me a hard time and were very unobliging about getting something else
If you want excellent Japanese in this neighborhood, go to Miyagi on 13th St
, they're extremely nice and the food is usually wonderful (and it's authentic Japanese, not posing to be Japanese!)
Great neighborhood place
Not fancy, but the fish is quality and the service is fast and friendly
One of my favorites in the city
Reliable
always
Went for dinner once with Turkish friends and the guys threw on Turkish music while making special orders and treating us like royalty
Lunch is lazy, just as tasty, and offers great deals
Plus, it's next to Perry St
in the Village, which makes for a great walk on any fall NY day or night
What an excellent find in the City
Floyd and his staff are some of the best you will find
Very attentive and yes a very small place makes for intimate service
Fish are purchased daily by Floyd (who likes to know if you are coming so he can get Something Special) and prepared to perfection
The Green Dragon is often imitated but never as good as it is at Sushi on Hudson
The blended tuna followed by a plate full of edemami and flowing cold sake is the perfect start to a great meal and a great night in the City!
If you are looking for a sushi place without the fancy frills, this is the place
It is a nice little place with a friendly wait staff and excellent service

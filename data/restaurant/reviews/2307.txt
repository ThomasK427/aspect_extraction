Fresh condiments and a soft roll complete the deal
Bring your eatin' shoes
Jackson Hole doesn't do small food
A great burger joint with some pretty good southwestern stuff on the menu as well
Their burritoes are quite good
Many, many burger varieties and you can get any of those varieties with a chicken breast instead of ground meat; the chicken breast versions are always cooked just right
The cielings here are low but when the weather's nice there's a garden in the back
A good place to relax and get fed well
Service is excellent 90+% of the time
One of my go-to spots for grub in the city
The best burgers in NYC, also the biggest
The service is pretty good
I went to the 64th st
restaurant once, but the 35th st
several times and it is awesome
I want to try the other great burger places to really get a good idea as to which is the best burger joint
Personally I like em' big and juicey
I get em' at jackson hole
I went with my boyfriend at 11:30am on a Sunday for brunch
We were the only people in the whole entire place
After we chose our seats and a 4 person table they told us that if it got crowded we would have to move during our meal!! The reson we didnt sit in the two poeple section is because 4 of their employees were sitting there eating and we didnt feel like being stared at by the busboys!! The whole time we were there only 1 other couple came in
The manager was rude and I wouldnt go back to that location
The other locations in Manhattan and even Bayside are much better!
Fat, juicy, good offering of toppings
The burgers are very good, but I keep going back for the pickles
Best homemade pickles I've had in this city and I usually devour them before the burger makes it to the table
Skip the fries, they are frozen bad diner quality
Open till 1 am and very friendly staff
This is by far one of the most juiciest burger I ever eaten in the entire city of New York
Not to mention the selections they have
I enjoy this immense amount of food which keeps me coming back wanting some more
The service is as always, wonderful! I give this restaurant a quadruple A+
I have had a lot of burgers in my time
None comes close to the sheer quality of these
And they are big too
If the Hole's hadn't been listed separately, they would easily have been #1 in this pole
They are close to dives though
The best burgers in NYC, also the biggest and juiciest anywhere without a doubt
I first heard of Jackson Hole about 7 years ago, but had never actually gone until yesterday! I think it is probably one of the few restaurants in the City where you can get a GOOD meal for two for under $25! The burgers were nice and big and served promptly
Even if you don't want beef, there are other menu choices like salads
I definitely will go back, but maybe I'll try a different location next time
Been the best for 30 years, keep it up guys!
If you like a huge slab of fried meat than you're psyched about J Hole
Personally, I would prefer any grilled/char-broiled burger in NYC over these burgers
Even tho the quantity is huge, a lot of greasy, fried meat is not that appealing
Kids also seem to love this place
I would've passed this place right by if my friend hadn't pointed it out to me
The place is very unassuming and you would miss it if you blink
All I can say is that the turkey burger I ordered here was the best I've had in NYC bar none
I've been a fan of McHale's burgers on 8th Ave
for years now, but I may have to reassess my loyalties
The food was fine
My burger was ordered up done medium so it kept crumbling up and falling apart as I ate it
A bit messy
The service was very good
Aside from the fact that this food is cheap, it does not deserve to have customers
Service was pleasant, but the food was poor
Cheap quality and loaded with fat
When I get a serious craving for a burger and vanilla milk shake, which thank goodness it not too offen
I am always pleased every time I go to this JH
One of the better burger places overall
Flavor good, you know what you are getting when you walk through the door
he burgers are the best
Theyr'e HUGE and they cook them under a metal bowl too make them VERY juicy
This underground burger nook offers tasty food for a great value and cheap beers
This is a viable option if Melon's is too crowded
Otherwise head up 10 blocks for the best burger you've ever had
The burgers are delicious, but difficult to finish
They have so many different varieties, it's difficult to choose! The chicken fingers are the best on the Upper East Side! Inexpensive, but good-bring a group! Burgers that are delivered are just as good!
Classic American Deco Diner best known and loved for a whopping burger that would put the company that trade marked the name to shame
Reasonably priced and sure to please with fast and pleasant service
These enormous burgers with every topping combination you can come up with absolutely melt in your mouth! If you haven't had one, you can't die a happy person just yet
This place is great
The burgers are fresh and enormous - go with a big appetite!
If you love hamburgers, this is the place
My children love it too
That's a real compliment
JH has and always will rule the Burger world
Contenders come and go, but the Hole stays on top
Know what you are getting yourself into by watching the grill up front, and then strap yourself in and don't be afraid to roll em up and dig in
Pass on the platter and split a combo (rings and fries) with your friends for a truly decadent meat experience
My better half says that the Turkey Burgers are the best that she has ever tasted
JH has several locations in NYC as well as one in Astoria and NJ
Slow and steady wins the race
So, to does this mexican winner
Not the most attractive of the bunch, but, the food and service is always on the mark
I absolutely love this restaurant
It's easy-going, never a hassle, and the salsa you get when you sit down is addictive! (smokey, spicy, homemade
) The tortilla soup and black bean soup are the perfect remedy for a cold day (try the quesedillas in the summer) and the flautas (sp?) are delish even without the cheese (lactose intolerance
yeesh)
If you're ever lucky enough to come in when they have the tuna special stop all further discussion and ORDER it
Ees very goot
After a night at Rosa Mexicano (just a few blocks down)
Dinner here makes you feel like you are in Tijuana! LOL! The decor is more played down and the food is what you may feel accustomed to
More intimate and romantic in atmosphere, this place is good for small gatherings or dinner for two
The food is basic and familiar and the staff is warm and friendly
Like night and day, this restaurant and cuisine is more of the everyday fare in Mexico whereas Rosa Mexicano is the haute cuisine
Both places are great but this is easier on your wallet
I love mexican food and just recently ate at Manana for the first time
While the decor/ambiance is lacking a little, the food was really, really good

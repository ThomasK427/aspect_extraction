i was excited to check this place out
the setup is cool with pool table and chill area in front and dining on side and back
only problem was i went for dinner not drinks and some pool
they had only like 2 cooks and waiters/waitresses were slow
the food took forever to come out
food was decent, but not worth the long wait
I've read other uses complain that Superfine is a bit pricey
Well, I can tell you that coming from Manhattan, Superfine's prices are a welcome change! My husband and I ate dinner there last weekend and the food was very good, and very reasonably priced, we thought
He ordered spaghettini with sausage, and at $13, it seemed a bagain; in Manhattan some DINERS charge that much for pasta
Not to mention, the bowl was literally brimming with their homemade sausage -- they didn't skimp at all! I had the grilled shrimp and scallops which was served with lentils and bok choy
It was a little bit more expensive at $19, but it was a good size portion, and so fresh! They obviously use the best ingredients, and considering that, they manage to keep prices down! The ambiance is also really cool! It's a fun spot
I've been to superfine about three times because I live in dumbo and keep thinking I should give it another chance
I'm done
Each time i've been the service is nasty, slow and simply ineffective
Even if the drink comes with a scowl it should still come
seems to take a lot of effort to obtain a glass of wine or an appetizer
And the food is ok, and only ok
Certainly overrated on the food front and under-emphasized on the service side
Save your money
And also, do something interesting with that space rather than hang bad art and throw a pool table in there
Superfine is my preferred destination in the city when I'm looking for a casual, hip atmosphere, extraordinary food at decent prices and/or just a place to get a good drink, chat with the bartender and shoot some (free) pool
The food is simple, sophisticated and unbelievably good
Their everchanging menu, which always features a stellar and exotic grilled fish, is small but exquisitely done
Prices are reasonable, and they serve some of the best fries in town
The crowd is generally thirty-something, alternative/artsy types who have moved beyond the silly W'burg scene and have learned how to dress
It's one of the few places in town where people of varied sexual orientations and races mix and mingle, which makes it an oasis in the Bantustan-like world of NYC bars and clubs
I have been to superfine a bunch, but usually for lazy weekend afternoons with drinks and snacks
I couldn't tell you a thing about the food, but I am not sure I would go there just for dinner
But, for hanging out with a group of friends, it's superb
how have i not written a review yet? i love this place! it is truly the best looking bar in brooklyn- what an awesome space- vast, smart, chic but not annoyingly trendy
the menu changes daily which is awesome but is slightly overpriced
drink prices are great though
the service varies- sometimes very snotty and too cool, other times more friendly and sweet
a great staple though
im very happy its in the neighborhood
Large space, exposed brick with a pseudo-1950 thing going
a bit like one of the sets from the movie DIVA
Very pleasant looking bar area and a lounge area with free pool
The restaurant area is a few steps up and towards the back
Attentive service (I've never had my water glass filled so frequently) and surprisingly good food
The menu changes daily
The red lentil soup was excellent (wasn't actually red, but what do I know), the cheese plate was diverse and tasty, the Greens turned out to be a wonderful salad with chicken perfectly grilled -- not a bit dry
Good portions
The wine list didn't look all that great, but there was a very interesting selection of beers on tap
Noisy, but not overpoweringly so
Will definitely go back -- if only to shoot pool and see what new ideas the chef has had
i am hooked
any day of the week
any event in need of meeting
superfine is the place
a loyal patron for nearly a year now
i have come to a place where i fully trust the powers of superfine -great food, great ambiance and incredible people- all the while guranteed to keeping the above diverse and spontaneous
in so many ways this place works
many of my business meetings i have at superfine during the weekdays because of the prompt service and food-(burgers are phenomenal!)
dinners in the evening are always elegant and warm
sunday brunch is lively, satisfying and great for kids
some tips i have picked up is make reservations for dinner and brunch, try and sit at a different spot everytime you go -(simply for the interesting vistas) and remember to acclamate yourself to the charm and grace of this truly special place
My friend and I had a joint birthday gathering there on a Saturday night and it was the perfect space
No snooty lists, lines or bouncers but still plenty of other funky Brooklynites out
We all just took over the landing with the orange pool table and loungey couches
Very cool DJ played Classic Rock, Soul, Hip-Hop
It's a make your own dance floor kind ofdeal but the drinks are really reasonably priced
Couldn't find anything like this in Manhattan or Brooklyn
Came highly recommended and did not live up to the hype
Spaced out servers took FOREVER to take our order after sticking us in the back sandwiched between the wait station and some spare furniture
Server gave us Polenta instead of Pork and then complained that's what she heard
Unfriendly incompetent staff with attitude bordering on disdain for customers
If we wait forever AND you screw up, buy us a drink at least to keep us content!
Live Bluegrass music, good food, and prompt seating made this an easy choice for us and our 2 starving kids
Been there at nite- and it was sorta uncomfortable with the bright gallery lighting
Now, during the day, it's too dark! But so what- the food was great-service with a smile, and the band just put you in a good mood no matter what else was going on
I also went to this restaurant based on the positive reviews here, but I found the food quite bland and not very tasty
The menu is limited so I opted for the jalapeno potato soup and a romaine salad
How can you go wrong with a salad, right? Ah
But the former was over-doused with lime while the latter was served in giant leaves of romaine lettuce with chunky slices of parmesan and barely any dressing
Unfortunately, the warm apple gallette dessert was burnt on the bottom as well
The service was great and friendly
too bad the waiters have to deal with the bland, unprepared food
this is a great space thats totally unique for bklyn
you can't beat it for it's people watching and free pool
this is the perfect spot for a big group
the best thing about superfine is that the people there are real, interesting(artists, musicans, ect
) and friendly
superfine rocks
organic and gourmet,s omething for everyone hip open dining room encourages flirtations with the cute guys who live in the buidling
The breakfast burrito was excellent, and the other brunch choices seemed good too
But the service was absolutely terrible, and we watied 45 minutes for food
The best thing was the bluegrass band
Not bad but not as good as others seem to think
I have had dinner several times at this restaurant and I intend to keep going back
The food is consistently fresh and interesting
Every dish I've tried has been outstanding and I learned on my last visit that the vegetables are from the local farmer's market and all of the meats are free range
This place has become my favorite Brooklyn restaurant
At the Farmers' Market in Brooklyn I got distracted by someone passing out strawberry rhubarb shortcake
Best shortcake I'd ever had
Find out it's the chef from Superfine
Why hadn't I checked them out before? Guess I figured they didn't have to work too hard cooking, 'cause there's not much competition down there
Now they can't get rid of me
The food was clean, fresh, perfectly prepared and I didn't have to go to the Farmers' Market to make it happen
The menu's small, but still accomodates the meat potatoes types, my fish fetish and my vegetarian mother-in-law

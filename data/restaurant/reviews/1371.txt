It's clean and comfortable
The only thing that Quickly should improve it's its number of seating
Increasing the number of seating available to reduce the long lines waiting to enjoy the delicious food that Quickly Shabu Shabu offers
I've finally found the best shabu shabu in town! It's right in the heart of Chinatown
My friends and I had a wonderful time at the restaurant
The ambience is great, unlike most restaurants in Chinatown
For less than $15, we had the freshiest meats and seafood and the shabu shabu even came with free bubble tea! I'm definitely going back there in the future!
One of my friends took me to Yum Yum 3 and I went back there alone several times
When I took my parents, the friendly female waitstaff I knew wasn't there
We had to ask for our check after waiting, but even so it took more than 10 minutes to get it and then another 10 minutes to get my card back
It was annoying considering the fact it wasn't busy (only two other tables seated)
When we left, my dad had to go back in because he had left something, and the guy gave him a nasty look instead of goodbye
I don't think we did anything wrong that day except that we didn't order any drinks?   As much as I loved their food, it was such a letdown
If you don't mind some random guy treating you bad, I guess it would be a good place to eat
I am a regular customer at Yum Yum Bangkok and this new restaurant of them is also good
I tried the Duck noodle and is delicious!!! for only $7
95????  Recommended!!!!
I tried this restaurant based on the reviews on this website
It was completely sub par
If you are looking for good dim-sum this is not the place
The food was completely typical and although it was cheap I would not go back
The quality of the seafood was lacking, the shrimp in my fried rice was very suspect
Save your money
just ordered a lunchtime delivery from friend house and was very pleased with the food
fresh, beautifully prepared dimsum (we ordered shrimp and seafood dumpling), the sticky rice wrapped in a leaf was heaven with shitake mushrooms and meat hidden inside and the summer rolls were good as well (though was a bit put off by the red peper inside : ( but overall the food was great (and you know how delivery can be half-a#sed - so if this is any indication of how great the food is at the actual restaurant
this place is great
in the new york scene where restaurants are fast to get a reputation and even faster to take it for granted - this restaurant seems to be one of the few that actually makes food asian food that is authentic and hearty - without any of the poser stinginess that you can find in this city
Hosted a large group for dinner on a Saturday
The service was excellent, the food was tasty and the overall experience was quite solid
I would recommend this place to anyone
All this, and your wallet remains in tact too!
This restaurant is so excellent
the decor is modern with lighting that makes the ambiance very casual and comfortable
The service was incredible, friendly and accomodating, my glass was never empty! The food came out hot, delicious and really well prepared
The dim sum was something I've never tried before and it was amazing! Spring rolls we're bigger than other thai places and the plum sauce had a really pleasant kick to it
the best was the entree, the chicken was so tender and the chef added some extra things to our dish as we requested and it was fabulous! Can't say enough great things about this place
the food was exceptionally great and the staff was so friendly I could have stayed all night
Oh and the two for one wine special was the icing on the cake! Friend Place 2 ROCKS!!!
friend recommended us to try this new thai restaurant on 14th street , and boy oh boy , this place was hot , waitstaff was good looking and friendly , drinks was good , they even have a happy hour
will definity be back and highly recommended
me and girlfriend walk by 14 street , and we discover this new restaurant , we were looking at the sign outside happy hours are 2 for 1 , and we decide to go in, once we walk in , nice big waterfall , nice tendy lights music was nice , waitstaff was very helpful , we order the green curry , nice creamy curry favor , mint fried rice was great , and we cant wait to go there next time to try there dimsum
Due to an emergency a friend had to cancel so we called to cancel the reservation all together
It was for 5 ppl
Granted I called an hour before our reservation but they were STILL going to charge me $30 per person for cancelling
I was NOT told this before when I made the reservation and explained to the manager RICHARD who has the poorest customer service ever and rude and said he didn't believe me
All reservationist have to tell people this
Well they missed me! I can't believe that I wasn't told this! If I had known I would never have made the reservation
And you're suppose to call 24 hours in advance to cancel
I didn't know this either because I wasn't told this!!! Totally shady! Better believe that I'm going to report this to the Better Business Bureau
We came for drinks a few times
Good drinks, i happen to like he busy wallpaper
Lounge area is nice to sit and chat
It would be nice to have more places like this in the neighborhood
drinks were about $10 each
Wow, I'm shocked at all the negative reviews THOR has received
My experience was quite the opposite
The dining room was fully packed when we arrived for our 9pm Friday-night reservation, with a line of walk-ins waiting at the bar for tables to free up
The crowd was about as trendy as I've seen in NYC, almost entirely composed of groups of silk tank-top clad women (think Sex and the City-style outings) and attractive young hetero couples
Service wasn't great - they accidentally gave us our neighbors' entrees, and there was a good 40-minute wait between appetizers and main courses - but the food was overall very good, particularly the desserts
THOR is one of the loudest NYC restaurants I've seen
definitely more apropos for LES pre-partying versus a romantic dinner, but not a bad option for a weekend outing
Seriously, this might be the worst restaurant ever
I am not kidding
I HATED this place
We were seated at a wobbly table by the stairs in a nearly-empty dining room
We asked if we could move to one of the dozens of empty booths and our waitress quite simply said, No
We shrugged it off and looked over the unimpressive, overpriced menu
When she returned tried to order a bottle of white wine and the foie gras to start
She told us that we were not allowed to order anything to start, it was mandatory that everything be ordered all at once
After much pleading, she eventually agreed to bring us the foie gras and when it finally arrived, it was lousy, straight from a can, and very expensive
We asked for the check
I will NEVER step foot in THOR again
Small portions
Overpriced
Rushed service
I will not be back to Thor any time soon
When we arrived, we waited 15 minutes for our reservation, only to be escorted to a half empty dining room, and to a table by the stairs
When we asked to move our party of four to a booth, it had to go through the waitress/hostess/manager first
We waited at least 10 moinutes for a waiter, who was very sweet, but extrmely forgetful and unattentive
We were brought the wrong bottle of champagne, twice
and when the correct bottle arrived, I dare say, it was the most enjoyable part of the meal
The small plates were tiny and nothing special
Of our four entree's, three of them were beyond salty
and the creamed spinach was like a ramkin of salt-lick baby food
Save your money and just have a drink at the bar!
Went here this past sat
night w my sweetie
the food was good i have to say, i had the beet salad to start and had lamb as my main dish
the beet and goat cheese was a great combo and the dressing wasnt overpowering
the lamb was very good but the broccoli puree was kinda on the salty side
overall the food is not bad but i mean the atmosphere was more bar than nice restaurant
i have been there before for drinks at the bar and really i think youre better off doing jus that
for a bar/lounge the ambience was nice and cool but for a restaurant and food its jus ehhhh
i think u can find better environment to eat your food in than this place
We were hugely disappointed, the food was terrible the ambience left a lot to be desired
There is nothing romantic about Thor
The tables are so close together that the 2 ladies sitting next to us couldn't help interrupting our conversation numerous times
The hamachi was fishy, the foie gras was bland
The table next to us agreed one of them is a restaurateur
The lamb was overcooked very salty

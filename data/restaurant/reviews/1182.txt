just a bunch of fried minced seafood stuff (probably a lot of that imitation crabmeat thrown in)
The peking duck roll was excellent and well-stuffed with plenty of poultry
Oh, and lest I forget, the Pad Thai side order was some of the best I've ever had anywhere, and the Lichido lycheetinis were perfectly made
not too sweet, not too tart
And strong
All in all, a very noteworthy dining experience
I made a reservation to eat here for my husband's birthday on 3/17
We were quite early for our reservation, so we decided to have some drinks at the bar
In between the fabulous sake-tinis and Sapporos we got to taste their green tea margaritas which were excellent
The bartender was very friendly and we never had to wait for a drink
When our reservation time came, we were seated right away
The service was excellent and the only thing that beat it was the phenomenal food
We never felt rushed and enjoyed every minute of this restaurant from start to finish
Simply love this restaurant
The sushi combination is excellent as are the rolls
The Ikura (salmon roe) is excellent and always very fresh
For drinks I prefer the Lychee Martini; strong and sweet
Great pulsating music plays while you stare at a cool lit up Buddha center stage in the restaurant
This is a nice place to come for dinner for couples
it has a nice vibe, nice decor
Not so great for a weekend gettogether for a group of people unless you plan to leave early, this place closes pretty early so be careful
The food was excellent, as was the service
Prices are standard for a NYC trendy lounge/restaurant
But definately worth a try, I will be coming back
Great place really, great vibe, nice date place, beautiful setting and the manager will do sake bombs if you ask which was brilliant, plus!!
I wouldnt say the place is stunning but it is a very nice place
If you make reservations request a seat in the back of the restaurant where the Buddah statue is
I did but still got stuck in the front but was too hungry to make a big deal
Service was too fast
My girlfried was still eating her appetizer and the waitress takes my plate away without asking
Next time I might stick a fork in her hand if she tries that again
Food was excellent however
Sea bass skewers,ceviche both excellent and Mongolian steak was fantastic with nice portions
I would go back but only if I eat in the back of the restaurant and if they let me enjoy my dinner instead of rushing us
Great food and Great view/ delicious sushi and chinese dinner
The service at this place is atrocious
A place this average has no right to have such an attitude
Avoid this place if you want a pleasant dining experience
This restaurant and lounge is one of the most beautiful spaces in the city
It has a giant buddha with a lovely fish pond and it is a perfect place for a quite dinner with a date or to gather friends in the lounge
I have been telling all of my frineds about this hidden gem on the upper east side and they have all agreed after visiting that it is one of the best new places in the city!
This is the perfect place to meet someone for an evening drink - someplace you can actually have a conversation without battling unnecessarily loud music
Love this place- almost didn't want to write this review for fear of inspiring the masses to investigate this hidden gem- but Aja deserves all the success it's building on
This place is amazing
All around I was very impressed with my first visit to Aja
Everything from the ambiance to the wait staff and most important the food was first rate
Everything was done to perfection
The Chilian sea Bass was out of this world and the Salmon tartare was worth going back for more! I need to go back and try more on the menu
I highly reccomend this place!!!!!!!!
In Short This East Village space has a calm, old-world vibe
The menu is Southern Italian: A coal oven produces crisp, thin-crusted pizzas with a variety of toppings, including meatballs, gorgonzola, grilled chicken, arugula, even spicy salami
A host of pastas are available as well: lobster ravioli, penne with mint and ricotta, oven-baked cannelloni; as well as hearty meat and fish dishes like meatballs and sausages, chicken parmigiana, and shrimp scampi
A while back I enjoyed a good meal there with bad service
Since then, TERRIBLE
Their delivery takes hours, their menu is a mess
I went there for lunch and there was ONE other table there with 3 people, after 10 min they came over, gave me a menu and I asked where their paninis were and they said We only serve that on our take-out menu meanwhile behind me there was one sitting on a PLATE! I got up and left and will NEVER return
NEVER
I originally wrote a positive review of Luzzos' back in Nov
But I've been back many times since and I have to amend my prior assessment
The pizza is still delicious, the crust altogether good
But he service has become crap
The old waitstaff was friendly and eager to show off how good their little pizza joint was
Now it just seems like they're trying too hard to make it into a fancier place then it is
and failing at that
The service is lousy, the waiters forgetful, they don't listen when they take your order
The music is too loud, and the back room crowd always seem to be filled with eurotrashy looking goombah types who are friends with the owners
I don't know what happened, Luzzo's, but go back to the original formula
It worked so well
A friend and I first saw Luzzo's chefs on the Martha Stewart show
We decided to try it out this afternoon and had a lovely time
The restaurant is small and simple, homey slightly nicer than a typical pizzeria
There was only one server on duty and we waited a while for menus
I applaud Luzzo's on authenticity - it was truly enjoyable to watch the chef / owner make the food in the back of the restaurant, ravage in the generous-portioned and very flavorful pizza (we ordered the arugula and the polette), and fill up on plenty of bread and salad
The chef even came to our table after and chatted about his hometown of Naples
The service and decor could use some help, but the pizza definitely makes this hole-in-the-wall worth trying
very overpriced for the quality of food, and service is poor
with so many good italian places within steps from each other, i see no reason to try this one -ever
WIth the glut of Italian restaurants spread throughout the East Village, Luzzo's is a welcome newcomer in recent years
Though we have never eaten in the actual restaurant, their take-out is excellent -- delicious, home cooked meals, delivered hot to your door
And cheaper than many other places in the area
Try them out on your next rainy night in
The Scene Down a dark, shadowy alley just off Bowery, the handsome, scruffy-faced men and understatedly glamorous women of the Lower East Side gather to drink wine, crowding around antique wood tables
Worn plank floors and painted cement walls, fit with moose, elk and other assorted taxidermy, give the place a quirky edge, as do the tattoed, waifish servers, who are also professional and expedient
The Food The affordable menu's inspiration stems from retro party appetizers and Midwest hunting lodges
Take the three best starters: nicely gamey wild boar pt served with a few smashed raspberries and cornichon; baked artichoke dip thick with chokes; and Devils on Horseback--savory blue cheese-stuffed prunes wrapped with bacon
Whole roast trout, stuffed with thyme sprigs and served with lemon, is simple and perfectly executed; macaroni and cheese has lots of addictive crunchy Parmesan bits
Finish with the warm chocolate brownie a la mode
Last night, as two friends and I racked up a $200 check at Freeman's, we were constantly rushed
Not only were our unfinished plates removed mid-swallow, but our unfinished drinks were cleared in order to turn over our table as quick as humanly possible
As a former waitress, I get this conceptually, and I am even understanding of the fact that I had to wait 30minutes to get my first drink because the bar was backed up
What I don't get is asking a high rolling, forgiving of bad service, drink guzzling table like mine to leave as soon as we finished out last sip of $12 martinis and left a 25% tip
My first experience at Freeman's will be my last, and BTW, there was something crawling in my salad
is to die for!!! no joke
one of the yummiest desserts i've had in the city
if only it could be crisp all around
but the rhubard filling itself was very tangy and flavorful
the restaurant overall is great for groups, unique ambience, pretty hip
try the Dark and Stormy cocktail - ginger beer and dark run, refreshing and excellent
Easier now to get seated due to the expansion but still like the original area better
We arrived on Tuesday (party of 2) at 6:55 sharp and the place was empty, with just a few people sitting at the bar

The food was delicious, the waitstaff was friendly and the atmosphere was comfortable
Even though the restaraunt was very busy, we weren't rushed
I would definitely recommend everyone go at least once
I was, however, hoping to meet the infamous Bobby Flay
maybe next time
Every thing we had was outstanding
A couple sitting next to us just stumbled in (not knowing Bobby Flay) and asked who the chef was, they said they knew this was not just any ordinary chef just by tasting the soup They raved about the food! I would go back even though there are tons of great places to go and eat in New York
Maybe because it was restaurant week and the menu was limited
Overall, it was an average meal that could use a bit of more seasoning
Try lunch here and you can do appetizer, entree, dessert and margaritas -- and feel like you're getting a deal
No, we didn't see Bobby Flay, but the food was fun and the margaritas were strong
We got there early and didn't have any wait for a table
I'd go again in a flash
What a disappointment! The Mesa Grill has interesting decor and a polite if somewhat slow waitstaff
However, the food was just not good
Sunday brunch featured a basketful of tasty muffins and breads, which were the highlight of the visit
The blue corn squid was tough, the 16 spice chicken dry, flavourless and served on a bowl of shredded lettuce with no dressing to speak of
The one good entree was the cheese and eggplant stuffed chile relleno, but even that was served with a bland side of overgrilled vegetables
I just hope Bolo does a better job
I had some reservations before I came here, wondering if this place was more hype than substance
But Mesa Grill blew me and my fellow diners away
Every dish was excellent
Bobby Flay is really good at blending and balancing a lot of strong flavors
The margaritas are also excellent, and our waiter was very helpful and attentive
The only downside--a minor one--is the space, which is a little small, oddly laid-out and rather bland
But the busy crowd and festive atmosphere make up for that
The Scene Decked out like an exaggerated version of a suburban British living room--tacky wallpaper, an extensive teapot collection, lots of ceramic figures, Vera Lynne on the stereo--Tea space is limited, and you can expect to be moved around during your meal to make room for other diners
The friendly but no-nonsense waitstaff is always ready with a smile and a comeback line
The Food The menu offers perfect renditions of such Brit classics as Welsh rarebit (thick bread with melted cheese, tomato and mustard), steak and kidney pie, Scotch egg (hard-boiled egg, deep-fried in pastry), tweed kettle pie (trout and cod wrapped in bacon and served in a pie) and bangers and mash (sausages and mashed potato)
Any one of these will fill you up for the day; for those on a diet or just faint-hearted, there are lighter sandwiches and salads, too
This place is TERRIBLE! The food is overpriced, though somewhat authentic, and if you DO overlook the audacious RULES posted at the entrance and unwisely decide to give them your business, you will be served without a smile
When a friend passed by and wanted to join us, the waitress told us he had to leave - no matter how much money he was willing to spend, THE RULES on the door said no one could join a table
I was actually about to order tea and dessert, but they passed up at least $20 of business to kick us out, though the place was EMPTY! This was one of the worst dining experiences of my LIFE! The truly bizarre thing is that people in these sort of establishments in the UK are SO ACCOMMODATING! Not this place
They want your money and they want you OUT
Never had English food (and honestly, the reviews I had heard about said food were never all that great)
That said, when I ordered the Shepards Pie with Beef, It was really surprising--as in surprisingly good
Peas and carrots on the side were simple and delicious
The service here is not really all that friendly and the Flat Coke she tried to pass off as Diet was awful but the cupcakes were delicious and the atmosphere quaint
I'd definitely go again
I grew up in the UK and ate this type of food many times
Back home it's hard to find a good scotch egg or a steak and kidney pie, I kid you not
This lovely little spot serves the real deal, the way it was meant to be - honest, hearty and affordable (alas this stuff can never be healthy
) I love the atmosphere and the caring waitresses
Oh, and the tea is great too
Who knew that the perfect English meal would be found in New York
Very disappointing
As an expat I got the craving for some English grub and headed over to TS
Oh dear
The very WORST of England distilled in to a cramped space
Horrible decor, rude staff and the place REEKS of frying
(Extractor fan?) I have to say I liked the food, but its way overpriced
I think next time I'll stick to their take-out (don't expect a heap of change from $50 though) or buy a tin of beans and heat it up myself
My family has been to England several times, and in the USA we're always craving and looking for authentic English Tea
We have never been able to find anything like T S
I was a little nervous, when we saw how small it was, that my husband and daughter might find it a bit uncomfortable, but we loved everything about it
Absolutely charming, wonderful food, superb tea (per husband daughter), and if you are a coffee person-the coffee was fab
The scones were awesome
A bit pricey, but well worth it, if that's what you are looking for
You have to 'get it', not for the typical American, not willing to enjoy something 'not American'
Can't wait to go back!
Delicious English comfort food
Mac and cheese is highly recommded as is the chicken salad sandwich
Bangers mash are good -ask for extra onion gravy
Teatime can be VERY crowded but it is tasty
Don't be put off by the reviwers here who complain about the gruff service or the 'rules'-the waitresses are cheeky - not rude
As for the rule 'no partial groups sat', it is a teeny joint and they do not have the luxury for you to sip water while you wait for your friend
It is clearly stated that partial groups are NOT sat until all members are there
This is a common rule in smaller resturaunts and they strictly enforce it
If you are looking for a polite, quiet place to linger and day-dream this ain't it, but if you want lively waitresses to go with tasty comfort food then this is your place
The other day I went there at 5:30pm for quick tea, and the whole time I was there their service people made me feel incredibly uncomfortable, glaring at me, asking if I was finished yet
Then my friend arrived at 6pm to pick me up; neither of us were aware of their policy to refuse to seat any latecomers, which she wasn't
The owner lunged at her and shrieked that she couldn't come in, so loudly that the whole restaurant went quiet and stared at us
It was shocking for my friend who had no idea what was going on, and humiliating for me
They have a right to enforce any policy they want, but HOW they do it is another matter
I will NEVER go back there again and will suggest to my friends far and wide that they don't either
Yes, TS is a bit cramped, but on the rainy day my friend and I went, it actually added to the coziness of the meal
The food was just ok - maybe I would've been more impressed with another dish
However, the selection of teas is massive and our choices were spot-on delicious! A whole charming pot to yourself
It would be a lovely place to linger, providing there aren't other waiting to be seated
American gal here who loves all things British
After watching my fav Britcoms, I wanted to try some of the traditional British foods, i
e
Beans on Toast, (by the way - these are all TO-DIE-FOR!) WelshRarebit, CheesePickle Sandwich, SteakGuinness pie, ChickenLeek pie, Lentil Casserole, Cornish Pastry, CheeseOnion Pastry
This place is fantastic! Who says British food is terrible? NOT ME! The menu is loaded with comfortfoods that Americans love, BangersMash (SausagesMashPotatos) Welsh Rarebit is like GrilledCheese - ONLY MUCH BETTER! Oh any by the way - handsdown - THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT - the place that has the best MacCheese in the USA! Everything on the menu is delish as well
Oh and the TEA!!!!! So many choices - all of them so delicious
And don't get me started on the apple spotted dick for dessert - don't eat it or else you will want to move in here!
They are direct about not wanting you to lounge around if others are waiting and aren't shy about scooting you out
But the food was amazing
My friend and I went for Sunday brunch and the wait wasn't too bad
We had the Full Veggie and the Bangers and Sausage plates, tea, coffee and treacle pudding for dessert, which was phenomenal
It's kind of on the expensive side, but you'll get a truly authentic British breakfast
I would definitely go back
If coming to Tea and Anthipathy (yea u heard me) during conventional dining hours, expect a good long wait on the curb till tables open up
Once inside 2 things immediately hit u
1) The attention to detail put into the quaint British kitchen decor
2) That u'll be seated about 2 inches from the next table
Expect your server to hurrily rush u a menu with another hurried rush to get u out
In between u'll be treated to some great tasting British grub at a reasonable price
I recommend the bangers and mash, if for no other reason than its just fun to say
I went with a friend on a Saturday afternoon for tea

This restaurant is not for kids, and the overall taste of the food is okay
I really wouldn't recommend this restaurant
Victor's Cafe is such an authentic Cuban restaurant
It has a great welcome feeling to it
The food was good
The portions were too LARGE for me
The sangria was AMAZING
Even if you don't like Cuban food go for the sangria
The food is okay
The portion is just right, maybe too little for those who would go for volume
The price is too pricey for the type of food
The ambiance is ordinary
It's a restaurant just convenient for theatre goers
We went in without a reservation after a Sunday Matinee
Courteous and friendly greeting and attentive service
Excellent choices from the price fixed menu, great little dessert, and very good glass of Argentinean Cabernet
Will go back again
Good food, if nothing spectacular
but a very cozy, spacious haven in the middle of Times Square
Good place to take refuge--great service! Not too cramped like many NY restaurants! (Don't order the gazpacho!)
I have not dined at Victors in a couple of years but after recent dinner, I would have to say it is in need of change
I was disappointed to hear that some appetizers were all out
How do you let yourself run out of the sampler? The last time my wife and I visited, we were entertained with strolling violins but they were missing as well
The menu needs to be updated! At one time, I recommended this restaurant to friends to try for something different but it is now lacking
I grew up on Cuban food, as did my mother (who is Cuban) and we decided to try Victor's one night before spending an evening at the theater
We both loved it! The black beans reminded me of my grandmother's and my mother said the ropa vieja was just like she used to have back home
It was easy to get a table, atmosphere was charming, and the waitstaff was very attentive
Give this place a try!
I will never eat at Victor's again
Threee years ago, I had a delicious boliche with fufu there (as a Cuban, I know what a good boliche should taste like)
Last Friday night I went back to Victor's after 3 years, and again ordered boliche with fufu
it was awful
The boliche had almost no taste, the fufu (mashed plantain), was not even completely mashed (there was a piece of plantain at the bottom), and it was cold
The black bean soup was ok though
I had heard the quality of the food at Victor's had gone down, and last Friday night, it was proven to me
Excellent Cuban food, among the best in the city
Try the Ropa Vieja and Gazpacho
Also has excellent sangria
I've never had a bad experience with the service
The prices are really not bad for that part of town
you can't beat this restaurant for value, atmosphere, wonderful service
It feels like the staff is very happy to serve you
Food is very, very good
Suoer location, we've been here several times (as out of state visitors) and would highly recommend
Extremely pleasant experience all the way around
My wife and I stumbled upon this place while walking around and decided to check it out
We had the pre-theater special, which I believe was $25, and included appetizer, salad, soup, entree, and dessert (and of course bread)
Everything was very tasty, and the service was good
We were lucky enough to get one of the two tables that are right by the sidewalk, as the front of the restaurant is opened up when the weather is nice
We will return to eat here on our next visit
Delicious!
The location can't be beat
The service is the old fashioned dining out mentality so don't come in a rush, or if you are let the server know in advance
Extensive menu plenty of dishes to choose from my dinner was so-so but my BF entree was delicious
Nice pasta dishes walking distance from the Sheraton New York
Friendly staff, good food, quiet restaurant that is affordable
I dined on the Tortellini Alla Nonna- tortellini in a light cream sauce with peas and prosciutto
I will be back again
I wasn't there very long and only had a couple of drinks so I don't have much to say
The bar tender was friendly but not very attentive and it was pretty smoky considering there were only half a dozen people in the whole place
The crowd was not particularly friendly for an Irish bar--the folks at the bar were in their own little worlds--in more ways than one
I went there for a couple quick drinks
A few local people were there
Had a couple beers at the bar
bartender was friendly although he could have been faster
People next to us were also
The Scene Goldenrod-colored walls trimmed with dark-wood accents, tile floor, brass rails, aged mirrors and frosted tulip lamps make the formerly stuffy room feel like a midtown sibling of Pastis and Balthazar
Once awash with hushed, reverent conversation, the space now bustles with a mixed crowd, though it's not quite as hip as the groovy lounge music might suggest
The relaxed service seems happy to have exhaled, though staff still sport bowties and whip off silver dish domes with grand "voila!" gestures
The Food The refreshingly retro menu includes supple, garlicky escargot, a flaky, smoky onion tart and wonderful classics like rich pot au feu, with a generous portion of short ribs, sausage, chicken and marrow-packed bones simmering in a leek-infused beef broth
Tender steak with fryer-fresh frites and airy souffles trnasport diners straight to Paris
The only sign of jetlag is the stringy seared foie gras
Very good French cuisine
I had a great steak tartare and the souffle for dessert was out of this world
The service was superb
My friend had fish and escargots and he loved it
Will go back anytime
Loved the new decor too
This is without doubt the BEST French restaurant in the city
It is class all the way
from the silver-domed entrees, attentive waiters, gallic bartenders, and old-money Upper East Siders
It is definitely an older, more mature crowd
as evidenced by the prices
Well-worth the money though for the quality of the food and service
The escargot and canard roti are INCREDIBLE
I used to go to LCB a few times a year before they revamped as Brasserie
The service was always impeccable, as was the food
Unfortunately, times have changed
The first time I ate dinner at Brasserie, we ordered a bottle of wine
The sommelier tried to pass off a different (cheaper) vintage than the one we ordered
We had to ask for the correct bottle
As I went to drink I realized my glass was (very) dirty and asked for a new one
The waiter (someone I know has been working there since it was just LCB) POURED MY WINE FROM THE DIRTY GLASS INTO A CLEAN ONE AND SERVED IT TO ME! I was flabergasted
I am a regular diner at fine restaurants and have never seen or heard of such a thing
I will never go back
If you like excellent classic French cuisine than this is your place
The decor was casual yet classy and elegant
The service was top notch
Chef Rachou has created a perfect balance of food, service and surroundings without all that formal bother!   It was almost 10pm and we were hungry from an evening of shopping
We headed to LCB without a reservation

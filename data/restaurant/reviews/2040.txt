The dining room looks cozy and romantic with candle lamps at every table, but our raucous party of 10 was welcomed with open arms and made to feel right at home
The staff - even those who had no expectation of receiving a tip - were attentive, friendly and solicitous
The biscotti gelato and carrot cake were amazing
I can't wait to try the jazz brunch
Definitely the best kept secret in the Village!
I came here with some friends and knew nothing about it other than the owners' middle names were put together to sound french but it was an american restaurant - and I was a little worried
Turns out that was the last thing I needed to be
We sat at this cozy booth by the window and had wonderful food with great service
They were out of a couple of items we ordered so they comped a bottle of wine - very nice gesture on their part
I hear that there are a couple of nice dining rooms downstairs that also have quite a history - including a tunnel to the White Horse Tavern (dating back to prohibition)
I think this is a good place to bring a date or even the parents
Not too expensive, good food and cozy for being as crowded as it was
I went with three others for an early (5pm) dinner on a Saturday
Seated promptly with our reservation, though our waiter seemed pretty unconfident (or was it incompetant?)
Luckily the busboys and other servers all pitched in to bring us our dishes and clear the table
Three of us had the red snapper, while the fourth had a sweet chicken dish (all on the menu I believe, not specials)
All of us enjoyed our meal, and for the price (~$185, w/ taxtip, 2 bottles of wine, 1 appetizer each, plus entrees) it was pretty impressive
Ambiance: romantic, plus a cozy feel (and not the cozy used to describe small apartments)
Would definitely return
Excellent food, great service, and a nice restauarant
We picked from the extensive wine list, shared a great escargot appetizer, and then enjoyed the wild boar and the snapper for dinner
Everything was delicious
The service was attentive but relaxed
I was amazed at the low, low price-tag for such a pleasant experience
Last night my husband and I dined at Philip Marie
A friend of ours had given us a gift certificate to the wine room
It was absolutely beautiful
The chef who is a bundle of personality came to tell us all about the special menu for the wine room
He told us that whatever we wanted could be prepared it was just a matter of deciding
I chose the lobster it was decadent
My husband went for the wild boar
We will definetely be returning and buying gift certificates for the friends who got us hooked
Of the great service, wine list, and the incredible food
The specials are always diverse, and one can find excellent and unique dishes during the weekends
A great place
The brunch food was good and my Bloody Mary was delicious
They have a few interesting choices on the brunch menu, it's inexpensive, and the portions are quite large
We sat by a huge window with a great view for people watching, and the murals on the walls are also nice
A good choice; I would definitely return
After dipping into corner bistro twice to check on the line and deciding that no hamburger is worth 30 minutes in a crowded line I wandered into this place
It's a delightful little Bistro style restaurant
The menu looked good as did the price, and they also had a steak burger which sounded about my speed
Though the food took a while to arrive is was perfect beyond imagination
A huge chunk of prime usda juicy goodness along with fresh roasted tomatoes on a kind of oversized english muffin along with some very well seasoned crisscross fries, wow; just wow
My girlfriend and I dined at Philip Marie Friday night and we were amazed at the experience
A gem in the Village serving incredible and incredibly priced food in a romantic, casual atmosphere
The service was superb and John, the chef/owner was so energetic, personable and made us feel as if we were VIPs
Everything is homemade on the premises and there wasn't anything that we ate that was not satisfying
From the appetizer and soup sampler to the awesome cheesecake and bread pudding, this restauraunt is a true find
I've been going back to this place for years, it's fantastic
Over time the quality has gone up and down, but I've really never been too disappointed and sometimes I've been amazed
Wine list needs to be updated, but otherwise great place
I found this place online and decided to give it a try
I am so glad that I did
The smoked salmon and aspargus was delilcious, the staff was attentive and never rushed us
The prices were fair as well
It's a wonderful place for two
The cute little place was found through our entertainment book
We've been back 10 times since
The food is good and fair priced
Inside is very romantic
The service was great, freindly and prompt
good value for this atmospher
Philip Marie is the perfect choice if what you want is romance
My husband and I celebrated my birthday in The Wine Room, and it was a night to remember
The room is beautiful and cozy, very romantic
Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, the music was very enjoyable, and the food is exquisite
My husband and I fell in love all over again!
Philip Marie is off the beaten path, but worth visiting
While not the greatest restaurant in the world, it is fairly good
Its small, but the service is amiable and the food is tasty
So, even if you rarely get downtown, I recommend making the trip at least once
We chose the tasting menu and were seated downstairs in the most amazing rustic, romantic room, something youd find in southern Italy
The sevice was better than anywhere I have ever been to and the food was amazing
I highly recommend this restaurant
It is a gem
Re-discovered this place after my girlfriend suggested we go
Met her there and realized I'd eaten there years ago
Remembered a great meal outside with friends on a beautiful spring night
Food was much better than I'd expected, I had roasted boar
Wine was wonderful, service was great, and the atmosphere was delightful
A fantastic place
Can't wait to go for the jazz brunch!
In Short Out-of-towners flock to this festively decorated restaurant for predictable Mexican fare and blended margaritas
The menu includes all the usual suspects--fresh guacamole, quesadillas, burritos--as well as Spanish dishes like paella
The bar features several TVs, making it popular for game-day drinkers
There's a spacious garden area out back, but the green lights can make eating there unappetizing
Well, I went to have dinner in this place last week, the place was busy and I request the wine list, there are some good choices and affortable, the food was good just the exception on the vgtbls in may pork chops ( too cold ) out of that, everything was tasty
the best part of all is the surprise for friend of my who was celebrating her birthday, those guys rock, seriuosly they make a happy birthday song with a real party mean, for all of that I can tell you, the waiter was making a very good job
I visited this restaurant a few weeks back with my girlfriend on a rainy Sunday night
We arrived at around 12:15am and were informed 3 times by 3 diffent people that the kitchen closed at 1am
I took a look at the wine list (nothing special) so we ordered 2 beers
For dinner I ordered Lubina a la Vasca (Sea Bass) and my girlfriend had Chicken and Rice
When I asked for some bread I was told that there was none left and that I could have some tortillas
The Sea Bass was served with a few clams, mussels, and frozen peas as a vegetable
The rice that came with it was COLD
I guess they didn't have time to put it in the microwave
When I tried the fish a knew immediately that it was spoiled
I sat with the plate for 15 minutes before I could get anyone's attention
(By the way, there was only 1 other table in the restaurant)

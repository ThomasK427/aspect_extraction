The Food Chef Ian Chalermkittichai brings New York what it has long been missing: truly excellent Thai food
Flavors are sharp, bright and clearly defined; the chef's skill is particularly obvious in familiar dishes like Thai beef salad, which rings of lime and hot chili on the palate, and a perfectly calibrated, addictive green curry bearing incredibly tender short ribs
The sea bass, marinated in a sweet-salty bean paste, is Chalermkittichai's answer to Nobu's black cod, and it's equally stellar
The kaffir lime tart is a fitting denouement
Went here for lunch with a friend and was pleasantly surprised by the service, restaurant decor, and food
The hostess was extremely nice and the service was amazing
Many servers were quick and attentive, never leaving much time unattended
The food was delicious and a different take on the usual Thai you find in New York
For $20 you can get a great lunch prix fixe complete with 3 courses
Unfortunately, I was a little bit disappointed with my tofu in soy and anise sauce but my friend said her chicken breast and vegetables (curry) were wonderful and the filet of snapper (3rd entree) looked delicious
The dessert with Jasmine ice cream and a sponge-like cake was sweet, just enough, and very original
I can't wait to come back here for another great, relaxing, and fun meal!
Beautiful space, tasty food and unexpectedly unpretentious staff
Gracious and lovely maitre'd seated us 30 mins later than our actual reservation but she made the waiting experience non-irritating unlike most other 'hot' restaurants that forget about you and give you unrealistic wait time estimates
Servers were nice but can sometimes be unattentive or seen hiding in their corners
I would definitely recommend the restaurant for dates and client entertaining!
I'd been putting off going here for over a year, until this past weekend when a Le Cirque reservation fell through (what else is new?)
Anyway, I'm very sad it took so long to finally decide to go here because it was amazing
We made reservations for 8pm on Friday less than two hours in advance
The waiter was very knowledgable and made a few suggestions to go along with what we had in mind
Her suggestions fit in perfectly and satisfied not only myself, but my very picky partner who dislikes spicy foods
The three types of foie gras were perfectly cooked and very tasty
The chocolate ribs were so decadent, yet so delicious we couldn't help but order two
The pork skewers were irresistable and if we hadn't been rushed for time, we probably would've also ordered a second helping
Also the fried rice with ginger and the thai beef salad were excellent choices as well
All in all, it was a great meal and I will definitely be back very soon with friends
With drinks and water, the entire bill came to just over $180 before tip
A bit pricy for some, but well worth it
The mixed berries mojito is the best I've ever had with plenty of muddled berries and lime - sweet but potent
We had the Thai Beef Salad (not really a salad), fish cake, seabass, filet mignon, and short ribs w/ green curry
Everything was excellent
The server, although with heavy accent, presented and explained each dish and sauces in a courteous and professional manner
He was also mindful in getting our table cleaned with new dishes after each course which is difficult to see in trendy NYC restaurants
As for desserts, the banana springroll was ok and the thai icecream sundae was good
Neither one was anything to rave about
There were some extra charges on the bill, but were corrected immediately when pointed out
The price was quite steep at $210 not incl tip for a party of 3, but I will definitely go back for the mojito, seabass, short ribs, etc
and the ambience
The best part: smoking allowed in outdoor tables!
The decor is gorgeous with a white backdrop and lighted tropical flowers
Service is excellent
Drinks are inventive ith things like the pineapple capirinha that sound good
I had the berry mojito which is excellent
People were cool but, arrive later for a trendier crowd
OVerall, a beautiful place to grab a drink
I have been to kittichai a few times
I thought -maybe it was an off night -that it might get better BUT
Reasons why I HATE Kittichai: -VERY LONG WAIT OVER an hour for our table
At first they kept on saying its only going to take 15 minutes-ALL LIES!
Eventually -45 min
complaining they gave us a CHEAP bottle of champagne
Honestly don't even bother showing up on time- call fist! -AWFUL ATTITUDE- Although our waiter was nice, the hostess and her other helpers were VERY RUDE, CLUELESS, and INCOMPETANT
It seems like they have never worked in a restaurant
-I cannot bring clients over to this establishment b/c of their lack of respect to their customers and sense of timing (sorry but a 9 pm reservation and get seated at 10:30 is just very wrong) -The food- was okay OVERRATED, the dcor was nice +
beautiful restaruant, nice waiters and waitresses even though none of them is actually thai
i personally loved all the decor especially the fountain with the floating circling candles
the thai poem on the wall is original
the food sucked straight up looks like a nice place to go out with date and have a couple of drinks
I took my parents and brother here for their 30th anniversary on Monday night
We sat down 6
30 - place doesn't get full until late - packed when we left at 10
Service was fantastic! Although many customers were very chi-chi, there was zero attitude
Our server was warm and attentive
We took our time, and didn't feel rushed
Food was yummy - portions are fine - we split 2 apps and each had an entree - I couldn't even finish mine because I wanted to save room for the dessert
Wok cooked organic chicken delicious but very spicey
Only complaint was that the desserts were so good we wanted the portions to be bigger (esp
jasmine flan), although it's best they weren't! Cocktails expertly mixed, by the glass wine was v
nice as well
Completely authentic? I don't know
But tasty, pretty, and pleasant
I'll be back!
The best meal we've had in NYC to date
The restaurant is a beautiful with many lit candles, trendy decor, orchids in glass jars, and a pond in the center
The food is just as great, and we enjoyed seabass satay, a wonderful beef salad, spicy curried monkfish, wok fried chicken, and white tuna
For dessert we had a good banana spring roll and crepes with delicius exotic fruit and coconut ice cream
The service was just as good
The servers and hostess were friendly and knowledgeable about what was good on the menu, and even the manager offered an item not on the usual menu
All in all, a perfect meal
I loved the ambience and presentation of food here so much
It was absolutely breathtaking, especially the center with the orchids and candles
We were a group of 4, and we had chicken lollipops and soup for appetizers, and kao soy (yellow curry), wok-fried beef, and wok-fried organic chicken with cashewnuts
Our friends liked the lollipops, but since I like spicy food, I thought that it was okay
The other dishes were very good, especially since I got mine at my spice level
We ended our dinner with fondue
It was not the best Thai food, but it was still very tasty and different from the usual flair
I will definitely go back - I want to try this other appetizer in the menu, and I want to sit next to the center
By the way, with tips, the tab was $110 for two
My girlfriend and I went here for lunch for restaurant week
We made reservations though the place was not crowded and we could have probably just shown up and got a seat
The restaurant has a nice ambience and short of a florist shop, I've never seen so many orchids before
Although the portions were not large, the food was very tasty
I had a white tuna dish with sweet peas, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms in a coconut broth while my gf had lamb curry
For dessert we both had lychee flan
I would definitely go here again
The only con would be that the restaurant is sort of pricy
Be prepared to shell out at least $100 for dinner for two
heard that this place had great food
went there
and it was such a generic experience

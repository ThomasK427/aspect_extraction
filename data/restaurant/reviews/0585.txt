Relax and drink a lot of the well priced red wines
I was real happy to go to a place that didn't rush us, had wonderful ambiance, a delicous menu of food and wine and some of the friendliest service
Seriously, the wait staff is on
They are not new to the demands and tastes of a client that is simply looking for a wonderful dinning experience
That's because they are not new to this, they are veteran people that know what they're doing
Azul is one of those restaurants that gets busy because the other better restaurants nearby have filled up
The food is always just mediocre and it's really noisy when the tables get filled up
also, we waited 30 minutes for our entree - were they catching the fish in the kitchen??
Perhaps the staff read some of the previous reviews of poor service, since they treated us well
Though portion size is definitely smaller than American, its enough to eat
The steak for two was delicious, the octopus and chorizo appetizers were very tasty, and my dulce de leche dessert was delicious
The Argentinean Pino Noir was a subtle, tasty complement to the meal
Nice vibe, mixed crowd and good ambience
Good for a date or chilling with a friend
Check it out
I'm not a huge meat eater, so when I'm in the mood for steak, it better be good
I was so impressed with the hanger steak at Azul Bistro
cooked perfectly, in a great sauce, didn't even need the chimichurro sauce served on the side
The portions were huge, the ambience romantic
the food and wine delicious
I was ambivalent about eating there at first, but the expereience changed my mind
i will give it this much, this restaurant looks fantastic and the ceiling is oh so nicely decorated
however, i found the food mediocre, not to mention overpriced
like the citysearch reviewer says, the trout is just that, salty, not to mention terrible and not fresh
i suppose this is the lesson one could learn for going to an argentinian restaurant and ordering fish
stick with the meat dishes, and you'll be safe
Great ambiance, great service, WONDERFUL FOOD
From their Churrasco to their empanadas through their fish, everything is absolutely delicious
Waitresses and waiters have always a smile on their face, even when we recognize a famous Colombian actress among them! The wine list is not their forte I would say
Their offers for 30 dollars are the 6-7 $ you usually get among Argentinian wines, they're ok, it's too bad that they do not include any Chilean
If you are in the area, and want to have dinner before or after going to the movies at Sunshine cinema, or just some of the new bars in town, this is definitely a great place
Excellent food, excellent service
No attitude
Very reasonably priced
Nice decor
Great place for those who just want good food, but without a scene, excess noise, attitude, or a lot of expense
This place really deserves a loyal following
Nice addition to the neighborhood
Intresting place, great pictures of locals and shops, good service and decent food
Its not that it was bad it just wasnt that great
The breaded steak/mashed was bland and plain
The Chilean seabass was an ecclectic combination aimed for the patron who loves latin flavors
I imageine with time the place will grow and the menu will develop
The food and atmosphere was excellent, however, the service was weak
To be fair, they were quite busy on a weekend night, but it was obnoxiously evident that our table was consistently forgotten about it
We were sat by the door with other better open tables available
When we asked to be re-seated at one of the other open tables, the host lied about the open tables
Tisk, tisk
I never feel strongly enough about a place to actually want to give it a review, but I ate at this little place last Saturday night with some friends and I loved it
The staff is friendly and nice, and the food tastes like it should cost a lot more than it does
I had the gnocchi with rabbit and it was delicious
One friend had a steak from Argentina that actually tasted like real steak
Another friend ordered a whole roasted fish (head and all), which was also really good
Best part: I had a great meal and drank a lot of wine and didn't feel guilty when the check came
I'm coming back, and bringing friends
Thanks for a great meal and a great time!
Great cuisine from Argentina, from the same owners as Nove Cento in Soho
Superb service
Excellent seafood (crab) dishes, and of course the steaks
Very good wine list as well
This is the most absolute awesome pizza in the world! We live in Florida and when we visit the city, Pizza Suprema is the very first place we go and the last place we visit when we leave
The people working there speak Italian and this no frills pizza joint is all about the slice!!!
awesome pizza, for $2 and 3$ for a slice
i agree, the sauce is phenomenal
Stopped here after going to Climate 8 and they have a great over-the-counter price! It was half-off all pizzas that were on the counter
Pizza was good, owner was friendly and prices were great! If I'm in the area again and need a quick bite to eat, this will be the place to go
Call it gravy, call it sauce, call it whatever you want
Suprema's slices are the best in the city because of the sauce
Ranger/Knick games or even a concert would not be complete without a stop over at Suprema
Pizza perfection every time
Make time to stop and eat at Suprema
Located diagonally across from the Eighth Avenue/31st Street entrance to Penn Station, Pizza Suprema is an old fashioned, pizza-by-the-slice pizzeria that has the best pizza slice in the city
In Short Since 1977, this discreet bakery on the northern outskirts of Tribeca has been baking high-quality pies, cakes and tarts for a discerning and loyal clientele
Among the best sellers: pecan and raspberry walnut tarts; Key lime pie made with fresh-squeezed lime juice; white chocolate mousse pie; apple crumb pie; and German chocolate and carrot walnut cakes
The retail shop is take-out only and special orders of 10 or more items require advanced ordering
Great place, great people and great yummy cakes! Convienient and friendly
worth a try anyday
Fresh wholesome pastry chef gourmet quality dessert's at incredible values
Although the service was probably the worst I've had, I'll go back because as a vegan, good food is hard to find
I went with 2 friends, for a total of 3, at 6 PM on a Friday
We were told 20 minutes for wait, which we didn't mind
But after an hour and constantly being skipped over while they seated other parties, we were very upset
We finally got seated in a small table, but a larger table immediately became available
They initially refused to sit us there, but finally gave in
If only they could match the quality of their service to the quality of their food!
Since VP2 closed, Red Bamboo seems considerably more crowded
I've had to wait an hour on a Wednesday night
That said, I was perfectly willing to pass the time down the street at the Belgian Beergarden in anticipation of Dante's Cuisine and a soy milkshake
I can't say the service is always great, and last time I went there was a very rude, ditsy hostess
The tables are too close together and it's awkward to get up and down without disturbing the folks next to you, but the food is still the best around
I have been here twice now and i just love it!! I am a meat eater, but this is a great place to brin your vegan friends
give it a try, you wont regret it
Wonderful food, wonderful service! Went w/2 meat eater friends who couldn't believe it wasn't real meat
Only downfall is the size and wait
However, I was complete prepared for the long wait after reading the reviews, so it didn't seem too bad
I recently visited the new branch of Red Bamboo in Ft Greene, Brooklyn, but it was my first RB experience
I am absolutely addicted
Everything on the menu is delicious and well-catered to the tastes of craving-stricken vegetarians and vegans, or health-conscience meat-eaters
The Soul Chicken and Bourbon Chicken dinners are fantastically done, accompanied by sweet corn mashed potatoes (almost as perfect as the meat itself)
I can't wait to go back!

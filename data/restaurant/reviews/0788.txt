We were sitting in the freezing air conditioning for 2 hours, and the staff basically ignored us when asked to either move or turn it down
When it is time to go, we paid in cash, and left 15% tip
Although this is not the 18% 'recommended' on the check I thought it was fair for ok service and some really good food
But the AC problem was not enough to get the full amount
My family leaves, and I head for the bathroom
Upon leaving, in front of the kitchen staff, wait staff and back few tables, they lay into me about the tip
Was there a problem!??? Why so little!???, etc
They were saying I only left a few dollars-which was well less than 10%
I was sort of confused on my math for a moment, but was confident I had left a fair tip
More on this in a minute
I think they were surprised when I went on the offensive and told them if customers are cold they should move them or turn down the AC or bring a darn blanket
I also told them that obviously the service was not that great if they had to ask, and that confronting someone like this proved that they did not really understand customer service
I left, somewhat confused but very mad
When hitting the street I told everyone what happened and we all realized that somehow the waitstaff had miscounted or stolen something from one another
We had paid in all 20's, and to make a long story short, their math didn't add up to the tip they confronted me about (I am a CPA by the way so trust me on that)
I called back immediately and the manager that had confronted me was basically 'sorry about that, we see now' indicating that they now realized also what had happened
Basically they got all over me on a 15% tip after all
Do yourself a favor, find somewhere else
I searched online for a good sushi restaurant for a special night for my Fiances Birthday
I chose the Bluechili
I am not at all a sushi fan but I was doing it for my fiance
Well to make a long story short
We had reservations to 7pm
I knew we were not going to make it on time so I call to reschedule
It was very easy
Strange! Ok
We arrived and was seated and realized that were two of a hand full of patrons for that night
Then come to find out they no longer served sushi
Wow, that was the reason I chose the Bluechili, FOR SUSHI
Their new menu was allegedly a week old and no longer served sushi
So for me it was a bad experience because the have advertising FOR sushi and comes to find out they dont serve sushi
Bad, bad
But the food was really good
I was just upset for my hard efforts to treat my Fiance, to her favorite cuisine and not able to due to false advertising
I'd walked by Blue Chili several times before dining there
I remember it being a hot day the afternoon I stopped in for a meal and I felt immediately refreshed the moment I stepped in the door
It wasn't busy and therefore relatively quiet
My friend and I had a delicious meal there
My duck salad was so good I almost forgot myself and started humming as I ate it
The decor didn't escape my notice in the least bit it was relaxing and impressive
I also had a rainbow roll that was pretty good with my salad and I'd have to say I left Blue Chili feeling extremely satisfied with my meal, the essence of the duck salad dressing lingered on my palate making me smile
Trendy? I don't know it certainly wasn't overrun by hipsters, but I had a great experience there
The food is great, the ambiance is terrific, the DJ plays great music
The martinis are pretty tasty as well
I definitely recommend this place for a either a romantic dinner or a group gathering
I went last night and had a WONDERFUL time
This place is amazing, the interior is simple yet elegant
The staff is very attentive and friendly
Now for the food, this was some of the best sushi in NYC and made with FRESH FISH
If you go you must order the following appetizers, the chicken sate (which was bought to us flaming) it was a real eye catcher and the Crab Meat Pancake which had lumps of fresh crab inside that were to die for
We ordered an assortment of sushi (California, Spicy Tuna, Boston and Shrimp Tempura) and were pleased with each choice
The presentation of each item was so stunning we almost didn't want to touch it
Every bite was a taste of heaven
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND VISITING bluechili
I CANT WAIT TO GO BACK :)
The service is great
oh and great martinis too! The atmosphere is very trendy and on some nights there is a DJ there
great place to go before you head out to a lounge
or just a night out with the girls
Decor at Bluechilli is fabulous! Very Asia de Cubaesque, the lower level is completely done in a gleaming stark white with lighted coloring behind the bar (it sounds weird but is actually very trendy)
For such a trendy restaurant, I was surprised by the small crowd in the restaurant
Food was good
Everything was about average but, the stuffed mushrooms app and pad thai are exceptional
Drink specials during the week
Service was excellent
Very decently priced for such a beautiful restaurant
Will definately be back for low priced pad thai is a great setting
Ps: I feel part of the reason why this restaurant isn't bustling is due to location
But, a definate gem in the neighborhood!
Ok, to be fair, the food is average, but when you pair the food with it's price, the food is WAY below average
I actually placed an order for delivery
I had asked for TORO (fatty tuna), but I felt that I received regular tuna instead
For those of you who had TORO before, you'll know that TORO has a distinct taste and texture
It's also pricy
The yellow tails I ordered were also of poor quality
It was the kind that was stringy and you had to chew it for a long time wondering if you would choke if you just went ahead and swallowed it
Overall, I was disappointed with the quality and taste of the food
It received such a high rating
And this is New York!!! I thought New Yorkers KNOW sushi! Ahhh, what a disappointment
Food was delicious and interesting
The grilled shrimp appetizer was fantastic
The changing color of the lights was a bit weird, but a cool effect
Went there before 6pm and found the place almost empty, so the service was great
Even after it got crowded we were well looked after
Definitely try this place out!
I found Blue Chili on citysearch and was planning a birthday party for my best friend, so I figured why not there? Overall the dinner was great everything went smoothly especially with a group of 15 people
Our large party was seated upstairs
The service was prompt and helpful, food was good, and Blue Chili really suited all the needs for a great Birthday party
The sushi was fresh, but the main focus for me were on the cocktails, which were all great
We had a wonderful Birthday dinner and a good meal
Can't complain
in the theater district where the selection of good eats and a fun, hip, low-key atmosphere is scarce, blue chili takes a stand
my friends and i had such a good time on New Years Eve here - the service was exceptionally friendly and hospitable, drinks were varied from novel martinis to your usual red, and the food had great presentation and flavor
this place is a find
enjoy!
We have a birthday party and it was excellent
It was a beautiful place and there is waterfall
Try grill sea bass and you will fly
lovely dessert
perfect for party

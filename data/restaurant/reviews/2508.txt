Not only that, I was shortchanged $5 - which I did mention to our waitress
Not coming back here, even though the food was good
soon as awash started appearing on 'best of' lists they took license to dramatically raise prices, cut portions
at first prices were only half as now, more sides were included
for every dish you would get 2 kinds of spiced bean side, potato beet side, salad side
for a while they served the rolled injera appetizer as soon as you sat down
now you get only the potato beet, one spiced bean, then your entrees (now on a much smaller plate than the huge pizza pie sized tray formerly used), lined with only 1 injera, and only 2 injeras to use (formerly 4)
food remains tasty, but no longer good value
we used to go because it was cheap
for the money i can eat at any other ethiopian in midtown
only redeeming quality about awash is that now they have rum cake for dessert, which keeps us returning occasionally
Awash is a wonderful place to go with adventurous folks (even out-of-towners)
The fritters are stupendous; the mixed platters are filling and tasty and perfect for sharing; the wine by the bottle is decent and cheap
Dont go for the atmosphere or the servicego for the adventure, the intimacy, and the fun of eating (without utensils) unusual and delicious food
I'm so happy this place is in my neighborhood -- sometimes the service is a bit slow, but it's always friendly and the food is always fantastic
Confusion reins! It seemed like it was their opening night
We had to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes and it seemed like pure chaos
The bar tender didn't know where the tea was, waiters started making the drinks if the bar tender wasn't around
Also, the hostess was overwhelmed (even thought there were only about 8 people waiting)
The best dish on the menu is their beef
My first visit to Awash marked my first experience with Ethiopian food, and I'm happy to say I'm sold on it
As such, I'm not sure whether Awash's menu accurately represents standard Ethiopian cuisine, but I felt it had a lot to offer
I went there with two friends of mine, one of whom was a vegetarian and the other following a Kosher diet
I'm a ravenous omnivore, and we all came away happy
DEFINITELY split a bottle of tej (Ethiopian honey wine, also called mead) -- it's reasonably priced and you'll be glad you did
This is definitely the best Ethiopian I have had in NYC and the cheapest
The staff is super-friendly
I especially recommend the vegitarian combo and the honey rum
while nyc's ethiopian choices aren't as good or plentiful as dc or sf, i think this restaurant is the best ethiopian in town
the dishes taste very fresh and the sampler comes with a very generous number of dishes
the service is friendly but slow and negligent, if you care about that
excellent value
Doesn't look like a typical American Diner but is an inexpensive quick and clean place for eating
I only had breakfast but the quality was excellent
You have to use plastic cutlery and paper plates but this keeps the cost down and is not that important to people on a budget
Convenient for anyone staying at the YHA Hostel
It is not exactly a restaurant although they serve food to go
The place is great
It is a real old fashioned feeling, the kind of neighborhood place that the Upper West Side was full of before the wave of corball, strip-mall loving gentrification
The service is very personable and the food is top notch
When a friend told me about this awesome pizza place that had slices the size of a table, of course I was skeptical and thought he was exaggerating
One night in the city, we decided to go and it was amazing
I almost fell over when I saw the size of the slice (probably equal to at least 2 and a half regular slices), so it's easy to have a nice, tasty meal for less than $5
Good tasting
The place itself is small, so you might have ahard time finding a place to sit, but still a place you need to try!!
the draw to this place is the fact that you can get a cheap slice that is about the size of your head
i'm really not exaggerating! it's huge and although i'm not a huge fan of the greasy, thin food that imitates pizza found in new york, this is pretty damn decent
especially a great place to stop on the way home from the bars
This place has the BEST Pizza!!! I would drive from NJ - use up gas, and tolls to have a slice of Pizza from Koronet!!! My friends and I would go at least 3 times a week!   NOW, I live in TEXAS
and I can't find a good slice of Pizza anywhere!!!! = (   Ohhhh the good ol'days
Huge, humongous, huger than huge slices! I paid 2
75 for a slice and a small soda
I was stuffed!  I don't think it was the best tasting
The pizza could have had more mozzarella but with cheese prices going up, I guess I'd okay for a thin-cheese pizza
Cool alternative to the Farmiglia across the street
Koronet pizza isn't thin-crust
It isn't a delicacy, the cheese doesn't bubble lightly on top, and the sauce doesn't taste like anythin special
And that's exactly how I like it, it's quality, solid, HUGE slices that are ready ten seconds after you order
I love this place, I'd eat here every night, you need one slice to more than fill you up
Go to Koronet's once and you'll be back, it's amazing
I have lived in NYC for 14 years and ate Koronet religiously for the first 13 years
They changed the sauce and it is not as good as before
Still huge slices and have to have a slice at least once!
I am not sure I would have graduated without Koronet 101 and my required stop every few days to get a slab
For me, this is the best pizza in NYC and probably the world, but I admit pizza in NYC is a subjective thing
The size (very large), is unique however
The pizza is average
The only good thing about it is that they constantly make it fresh and it is cheap
Yet the owner is so ridiculously rude that it isnt worth patronizing this place
I've never been to a pizza place where they refuse to heat up the slice if you ask for it hot
Its not like it costs him anything!
The Scene Raised in Italy, Sal and Carmine have been in the pizza business forever
They know their product is the best, and they don't have to gussy it up by smiling at the customers, letting it suffer through delivery, or any of that nonsense
There are a few tables in the back, where pizza connoisseurs can be seen huddled over their pies
The Food This is the pinnacle of the classic Neapolitan-American slice
It's worth the trip uptown, without question, just for the plain pizza
There's nothing out of the ordinary, just the most excellent, fresh ingredients, including superbly creamy full-fat mozzarella, sauce with a rare tomato-y tang, and crisp-but-chewy flavorful crust, all combined in an exceptional whole
The pizza is not over-cheesed like that of many competitors, nor is the sauce too sweet or raw-tasting
The standard array of toppings is available, but hardly necessary
Who comes up with these pizza ratings, people from the sticks? My cuz and I went there recently, she is from Queens and I am from Bklyn
We know neopolitan pizza
The first pie wasn't done enough and barely rated a 6
The 2nd pie was more well done but still didn't rate any more than a 7
Like a couple of other reviewers, I'm old enough to remember Sal's when it was a tiny joint on Broadway between 94th and 95th
(Anybody remember its competition, Phil's, on B'way between 94th and 93rd)? The neon sign in the front of Sal's and Carmine dates back to that era
Anyway, its pizza is a nice nostalgic treat, as good pizza by the slice in NYC has become harder to find
But the last time I was there, about two weeks ago, something had changed
The dough was good, but the cheese seemed different
The pizza seemed to have reverted to the standard NY fare
I immeadiately thought of Ray's on 6th Ave and 11th St
, which was awesome until it was sold several years ago
It has the same decor, but the pizza has nothing to do with what made that store famous
I hope what I recently experienced at Sal's and Carmine was an anomaly
Being from New Jersey (contrary to popular belief home to the worlds best pizza) I have been around great pizza my whole life
In my 6 years in New York I could not find pizza that matched up, that was until I tried Sal and Carmines
Sal and Carmine are artists and the dough is their canvass
Sal and Carmine make the best pizza in NYC
As an native New Yorker, my pizza palate is near impossible to please; however, after a long, long search, a foodie friend introduced me to Sal and Carmine's and I was sold
The environment is old school NY pizza place, service is no frills - it's just all about the pizza
Phone it in, pick up a bottle of wine, grab the pizza and head home for a great dinner

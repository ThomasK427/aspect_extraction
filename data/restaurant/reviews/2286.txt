It is right around the corner from Radio City and made it perfect for our ladies nite out
We enjoyed all that we had and they were very gracious about accepting our coupon from Citysearch for 25% off our dinner - even on Saturday nite! We had the fettucini with vitello and rigatoni with shrimp
Both quite tasty
I would certainly go back
Good food, decor, service in Rockefeller Center area
My party had chicken, fish lambchops -- all delicious
Pasta dishes at other tables looked good
Food prices a bit high, but typical for this neighborhood
Drinks overpriced
Perfect in every way
The service was impeccable and the food and wine was top rate
The chef really nows his stuff
The deserts are fabulous
i really enjoyed tuscan
my brother and i took our father there for father's day because it was close to radio city where we saw patti labelle
food was great! when we were seated we noticed the lovely decor it was like having the sunshine indoors! every detail was beautiful right down to the see-thru plates that had flowers/wheat embedded in them
great food, order the chocolate cake it's very rich and deserves coffee or milk
very attentive service
i even printed the coupon from citysearch and they gladly accepted it with no problem
we had a wonderful evening without having to dress up! i'll be going back
Very busy deli - but that does not mean that one should be rude to your loyal customers
The girl who takes phone orders should take a few lessons from Miss Manners and learn some phone etiquette - and English while she is at it
Very very rude - seems as if she was doing me a favor for buying food at the deli!!! Just lost several customers here and I will tell others not to patronize - not the only deli in town
Just stopped in today, and will not return, Starbuck's is SO much better
This DD was in the Rockafellar plaza, so it was touristy
Uncomfortable seating, loud ambiance (hard/loud floors)
Service was HORRIBLE! They are SO slow here, running one line for EVERYTHING, for waiting on coffee and buying food
Just awful
I was so annoyed by everything, we left soon after
Blah!
In Short Established in 1939, this fast-food restaurant still makes its legendary fried chicken with the closely guarded blend of 11 herbs and spices originally created by founder Colonel Sanders
Modern additions to the menu include oven-roasted renditions of its chicken sandwiches, popcorn chicken, potato wedges and wraps
Classic sides include flaky, oversized biscuits, steaming-hot mashed potatoes and gravy, smoky-sweet baked beans and crisp, generously dressed coleslaw
Kids and adults love the "little bucket" parfaits of pudding desserts
the chicken was outstanding and the service was great too
The Scene This intimate space, which received a coveted exemption from the New York smoking ban, fuses the spontaneity of a Havana social club (impromptu salsa sessions, vibrant live music) with the moneyed machismo of a Wall Street boardroom (mahogany paneling, 70/30 male-to-female ratio)
The crowd combines bright young things decked in Dolce    steak comes paired with mashed potatoes creamy enough to make any Atkins-addict crumble
Warm chocolate truffles in powdered sugar are the perfect way to end (or start) a pleasurable evening
The Club overall can be fun, but if you think you have reservations, think twice
We called in early November to book our Christmas party for December
I called on Monday for our Friday reservation to confirm our 25 person reservation
I was told they had been trying to call me, since the Club was closed that night for a private party
They had my correct phone numbers and they even said they left two messages on my cell phone
Needless to say, with 4 days notice I had to find another place to book our party
Not only did we not have a reservation for our Christmas party, but the manager wasn't even very apologetic
I have to agree with the other review here about management
I was pretty appalled at the attitude
Basically, Sorry, you are SOL
Once you get by the general manager with the Napolean complex, you will find an excellent environment for enjoying fine cigars and beverages
Service among the staff is friendly and excellent
Just stay away from management! They see customer as an inconvenience!
I tried to visit Club Macanudo recently, a place that I have been to more than 10 times
At the door, I was rudely told, NO JEANS by the doorman
I told him I had been here many times before and he responded WEARING JEANS???, I said I didn't remember
My girlfriend, also wearing jeans, was told, she's ok, but you're not
Now, my jeans probably cost more than this bozo's entire outfit
I was also wearing a very nice sports jacket and very nice collared dress shirt, with very nice leather dress shoes
I was well dressed
Didn't matter
Last time I visited, 8-9 months ago, I noticed several people wearing jeans
This place is on my DO NOT GO list, I'll tell everybody I know to stay away from this dump
They just lost thousands of dollars in future revenues, I will never visit this garbage dump again
Had to visit here on my recent trip to NYC
A nice place with atmosphere but they really pissed me off
AFTER lighting up my $20 Padron Anniversario the waiter told me that I could not smoke my own cigar and that there was a $10 minimum cigar purchase! He also said that there was a $20pp drink minimum for table service
Now I'm from Philly where we don't have this type of crap and you can bring and smoke your own cigars
Next time, I'll go elsewhere and avoid the attitude and all the rules!
The concierge at the W Hotel turned us on to this gem of a cigar bar and we're happy he did
After having been informed at Angelo Maxie's that cigar smoking is no longer allowed in their cigar bar, we made our way to Club Macanudo and readily found ourselves in a cigar and wine lovers heaven
The decor is worth a mention, with plush seating areas that range from bar stools to table/chair combos to full sofa areas
The colors and artwork are an ohmage to the artful history of cigars and their Cuban/Caribbean roots
Cool people, relaxed atmosphere, and wonderful cigars
Can't be beat!
Great atmosphere, live music on Saturday nights (good live music) and a relatively smoke free atmosphere - if that makes any sense
Drinks are expensive but the mohitos are great!
The Scene This narrow, ornate restaurant is a quintessential East Side scene, with flurries of post-museum, pre-theater Europeans and lacquered dowagers sipping exacting martinis
The young, skilled staff operates with a refreshing lack of stiffness, putting both special-occasion diners and regulars at ease, despite the handicaps of the somewhat awkward space
The Food Seemingly simple dishes, such as roast chicken and broiled fish, are given a veneer of nobility with careful French techniques and eclectic flavor inspirations from Asia and the Middle East
Cumin-scented carrot confit gives a rich filet of bass a twinge of Eastern panache; abundant butter makes a hot porcini tart extra special; and beet green-filled ravioli in brown butter is remarkably flavorful
But roast chicken with ginger and olives is a bit over-salted, and a carpet of mushroom bits fails to rescue a flavor-shy sirloin--the soggy fries don't help
Finish with the warm Valrhona chocolate cake
Party of 4 had great time at this upper east side landmark! Server happily gave us recommendations and was right on the money with each one
Don't miss the Black Bass over carrot confit with cumin and cilantro and the warm chocolate cake!
I had a great time here
I only had some desert and drinks they are all amazing
overall very nice casual french place
we took our time and our server was very attentive
I hadn't eaten at JoJo for years
The decor had changed -- lots of toile now
It was perfect for Christmas dinner last night
My first course of the vegetable tasting menu (a bargain at $45) which was wonderful- a very rich and refined version of butternut squash
The second course, a goat cheese fondue was nice, but nothing extraordinary, the main course, a porcini mushroom tart tasted great, but was a little on the soggy side
A lovely passion fruit puree in a meringe shell for desert was a perfect ending
My dining companion had a tuna tartare appetizer wrapped in a phyllo crust with a fava bean puree which looked pretty good and an alsatian lamb stew as her entree, which tasted nice, but not something I would have ordered
Her banana praline cake for dessert was divine
All in all, a pretty nice experience
Nice decor
That's about all the praise I can give the place
Terrible service; the worst steak I've eaten in NYCity
The fish my wife had was cold and runny (Black Sea Bass)

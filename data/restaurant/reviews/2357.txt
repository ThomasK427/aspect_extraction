The friendly service, tastey and timely food, and inexpensive prices makes Gene's Coffeeshop an excellent place to grab a meal!
THE FOOD WAS GREAT AND THE WAITERS ARE TERRIFIC, BEST FISH I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME, AND THE APPETIZERS ARE VERY TASTY
Everything was great
The appetizers were great, my favorite is the grilled octopus, the best ive ever had!!! Yes the waiters are all old men but they are all very nice, Try it you will not be disappointed
The taverna-like decor is relaxing, if a bit dated, and the waiters can sometimes be grumpy old men
If dining alone, take a seat at the small bar, and stare at the very cute bartender while sipping your ouzo
By all means, try as many appetizers as you can handle, because they're all delicious
Most of the entrees are inconsistent, except for any charcoal-grilled whole fish
The complimentary dessert wine is a nice touch
I've eaten at Meltemi once
The crowd is very mixed
The waiters are all old men
The restaurant has a cafeteria-esque feel
The waiters/helpers seem to share the tables, so the service was good
The combination appetizer was delicious, and the fresh, hot pitas were to die for
The garden salad was also fresh and crisp
We had high expectations for the main dish, but were a little disappointed
I ordered salmon and it arrived half raw, so they had to recook it
My boyfriend's fish was soaked with some tomato sauce, and it was too soggy
For dessert, we ordered Baklava, and got a dry, bitter slice because the bottom of it was burned
Then we got the bill, a total of $100 for the two of us
Too expensive for the full meal, just go for the appetizer
Been there many times and absolutely love the food! After starting with the Saganaki, the shrimp stuffed with fresh crab meat has been my favorite thus far
The servers host can get a bit ruffled if you request a certain table, or any other 'special' requests - we were denied when we requested a large table for 10 - but is great for smaller groups
Lots of years,lots of burgers since last here
The burger was soft crumbly tender with juicy flavor,a chin dripper,searched my memory not sure if its the same
might be a tad smaller than in my minds eye
but just as soft and juicy
a real small place take your coat off out side cause you cant do it once your in this matchbook size old timer
They have those little boxes of corn flakes on the counter so you know breakfast is a good time to drop in also
I had a sad experience in another Scandi restaurant downtown a week or so ago, but I know that this is a delightful, wholesome cuisine and hoped that I could find a place in the City that would deliver just that
I did
My friends recommended Ulrika's, so we went last weekend
This is much more like it
From perfect, moist and delicate meatballs, to hearty prime beef and fun desserts, everything I tried was how it is supposed to be
And don't forget to taste the home-made herring, even herring doubters should be pleased by Ulrika's blend of sweet, salty and spicy
The service was relaxed and efficient and the room is comfortable and modern
I grew up outside of Stockholm, but have lived in New York for the past 20 years
Ulrika's is by far the top Swedish restaurant in the city
I love everything I tried here
Last time we ate the best Rraka this side of the pond, it's crispy potato pancakes with fish roe and onions
The toast skagen here is just like I remember it, dilly and light
The fish soup is also light, just a touch creamy, and has generous portions of seafood
And Beef Rydberg is delicate, yet flavourful and hearty
Staff is super sweet and so is the cozy dining room
My wife and I honeymooned in Stockholm, and the food at Ulrika's is just like we remember it
Her herring plate came with about six kinds of herring, attractively presented like sushi
I had Swedish meatballs with a nice beet salad, and washed it down with lingonberry soda
Very tasty and friendly
Ulrike herself is usually there mingling with her guests and helping the place maintain it's warm feeling
The food is authentic and delicious with reasonable sized portions in a culinary artistic presentation
It's the perfect place for a nice dinner after work with friends
I love Scandinavian food
This place is as authentic as many of the lovely restaurants I visited in Sweden
The herring appetizer comes with 4 or 5 different types of fish and a boiled potato, it was tasty and big enough for 2
I tried the laxpudding, or a salmo and potato tort, it was perfect, not too rich, with a lovely flavor of dill
Me friends meatballs were exactly how I remember them from Stockholm
The cloudberry martini was a lovely way to kick things off and chocolate sampler a great way to finish off
The service here is young and super friendly
Yum
I've been to Ulrika's twice
The first time, two years ago, the service was friendly but slow
The food was quite good
I recently went back and had no complaints
The service was friendly and the food was very good
One thing--we received free Schnapps and dessert because they felt we waited too long between our appetizers and entrees
My date and I hadn't noticed anything amiss, but we were very impressed with the gesture
I recommend the restaurant
My review might be a bit biased given we went with an ex-cook from there-so we got treated very nicely
We didn't even get a menu, just let the chef send out anything he wanted
But food is food and everything that came out of that kitchen was phenomenal -flavorful, varied, and at perfect temperatures
I am not a fan of lobster or scallops, yet I devoured both that came out of that kitchen; as well as SOME of a truffled pasta (nope-don't like truffles either)
Service was EXCELLENT! I believe our friendly server's name is Daniel-who speaks like 300 languages and also bartends
Definitely recommend!!
After walking by often during lunch hour, decided to try it for dinner
Very pleasant evening--very good drinks, smoked salmon appetizer with honey mustard sauce was very generous; swedish meat balls and mashed potatoes very tasty on a cold evening; interesting desserts; nice flat breads and complimentary taste of soup--delicious
A couple near us got the tasting menu, which looked really interesting as well
Having just eaten at Ulrika's, I was amazed at how unwelcoming the hostess was
Nevertheless, after waiting for an eternity to be seated, we finally sit down and wait for our menus, wait for our food, and to our surprise the food was minimal relative to the price
I am surprised how many positive reviews this restaurant has gotten
I think people need to wake up and realize that the only place to have good decent Scandinavian food is at Aquavit,AQ Cafe, Tja, Christers, or go to Sweden
The space that Ulrika's now occupies used to be a restaurant called Carola's
Bring that back! and stay away from here
The name should be called SIBERIA
I have visited Ulrika's restaurant on several occasions, and I always receive the same, unfriendly treatment by the staff
Being a fellow Swede myself, I thought it would be exciting to treat my American boyfriend to a nice meal at this Scandinavian restaurant
However, we were both greatly disappointed
The food, even though delicious, was overpriced and the portions very small
Furthermore, the personel expressed a very cold and unwelcome attitude towards us
From now on, my boyfriend and I will be having our Swedish meatballs at IKEA!
The service is friendly and attentive without being forced, atmosphere is relaxing
The food is simply outstanding, presentation adds to the whole experience
Makes for a wonderfull evening out
Food and presentation were excellent
What a surprise for such a casual and unpretentious place!
What a fantastic experience, from warm and friendly service to a fun and comfortable atmosphere - not to mention the FOOD!! Everyone in that restaurant including me felt as if we had just run into a long lost friend who happen to own and restaurant and be a fanstastic cook
What a great place to go for a homey meal and great Swedish food, I know I will be back!!
This place is truly wonderful
Amazing food, friendly and competent service
No complaints at all

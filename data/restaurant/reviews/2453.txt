The food was just ok, service marginal
The ceasar salad didn't taste especially good had too much anchovy ( I like anchovies)
The waitress, though polite, basically ignored us after taking our order
And it was expensive for what we got
To say something positive, the bread was very good
I'd try it again, maybe it was just a bad night, but with so many other better places nearby, I wouldn't rush back
Went there for only the second time last Thu with friends at 9pm for a quick bite
The waitress lost some points for not refilling our champagne glasses
We only wanted appetizers but also ordered a pasta entree to share
It couldn't be helped, delicious! The mussels were all fresh, unlike most places in NYC where you always get a few bad ones
The beef carpaccio was also marvelous as was the apple pie dessert
The first time I went, we rushed to catch a show
Take your time and enjoy wine or champagne or both
You won't be disappointed
Only thing not on the regular menu is a nice veal dish, parmagiana should be a staple in every italian restaurant
I always try to use it for an apples to apples comparison
But then again, I'm neither italian nor a chef, just an amateur food critic
We have eaten at Gabriel's several times, and each time the food was delicious
It is not completely authentic Italian but very good anyway
If you go, be sure to request the Italian waiter (I think he's the only one in the restaurant)
He's great--really knows a lot about food and cares
The decor could use a little bit of an update
Overall, a great place to eat if you're going to a show
Gabriel's is both dismal or very good
We have been there numerous times times over the last five years and have found the food and service very inconsistent
One time the food and service top notch, another time the food is uninspired and the service poor
The previous reviews only confirm the assessement
In other words it's hit or miss
If you find the right nighy, enjoy
Otherise you have our complete sympathy
The reds are served far too warm, the whites far too cold
This is a pity since the selection really is good
Even a great wine can be ruined if served at the wrong temperature
Food was of mixed quality
A side of grilled asparagus with parmesan and quail egg was fresh and simple
The Caesar salad was sub par as was the grilled tuna
The pappardelle was nicely smokey, however
Despite the editorial review, our desert of chocolate-hazelnut cake was dry and a few days from fresh
Seating was far too crowded
The hostess, bartender, and waiter were so friendly and attentive
Really amazing service
The mussels (appetizer) were excellent, but the entrees (red snapper for me, seared tuna steak for my friend) were lukewarm and dissapointing
There are too many other places in the city I'd rather go to for a $30 entree
The dinner and wine menus offered many tantalizing options, from which it was truly difficult to choose
The service and staff were excellent: accomodating, helpful and charming
A truly lovely evening and ideally located quite close to Lincoln Center for pre-opera dining
My wife I visited Gabriel's before a show at nearby Lincoln Center
We both enjoyed our meals very much
She had the Tuna Steak I had the Seared Sea Scallops
Both were cooked perfectly
The service was great and the wine list was exceptional
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
bad for words
Too crowded
Too smelly (could've been the guy eating the gigantic sardines at the TOO close table next to us)
Too noisy
Too BT
Too loud
Too expensive for what you get
Too bad
Have eaten here a dozen times or more, this is an absolutely reliable standby
Love the pastas and the pork shank and definitely get a recommendation from the sommelier - he is excellent and won't suggest anything overpriced
Good restaurant
Service is good
Food is good
Better than many for restaurants on the west side
We live a few blocks away and have become regulars
It's too pricey to go every week but it's always terrrific and brings us back 1x/mo or so
The staff is very professional and friendly
A terrific place to linger over a nice wine -- their cellar/selection is excellent and sommelier is terrific, too
Casually elegant setting, and good place to pop in for a drink, too
I've been to Gabriel's once before and had great service and an excellent meal
My wife I returned and tried different menu items
This time, I liked it even more than the first visit and the wine selection is exceptional
I highly recommend Gabriel's
Soo many better restaurants in this area that this should not even be around
The food is mediocre and the prices are too high! I had seafood lasagna with shells in it and just plopped into a bowl
It took a very long time to receive our food as well
Go somewhere else!
The #1 worst restaurant experience ever
As other diners were seated around us and began to get their orders, we waited over a bottle of wine
The waiter would not respond to us
Finally, with 20 minutes to go before our theater performance, the waiter brought our food explainig he would send the manager because the kitchen lost our order
The manager arrived saying Yeah, what's the problem here? When we explained, he offered dessert
But we were already late for the theater, so, as we scarfed down our food, we asked if he'd comp the wine
His response was to berate and insult us with language unprintable here
We will NEVER be back
The food was decent but not worth the $350 + it came to for just three of us (before tip, just one bottle of wine)
We had to wait quite a while between appetizer and entre so not sure it is good for pre-theatre
Overall, I would say there are better, more reasonably priced restaurants in the area and for the type of food
This restaurant is great
The pasta I had is outstanding
Service was slow but the food made up for it
You have to try it
this is a classy restuarant with great food
not your typical dull Italian, this it the real deal
service is attentive and pleasant
highly recommended
I've been to Gabriel's many times for both business and personal meals, and although the food is delicious and interesting, there's something about the ambiance I don't like
It's a little too roomy, and feels a bit sterile

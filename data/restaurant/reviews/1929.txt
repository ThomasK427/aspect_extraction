My husband and I both love the unique flavors offered
Lychee, Red Bean, and Pineapple are among our favorites
Green Tea, however, is very mild in flavor - so if you are looking for the more stronger flavored version often found at Japanese restaurants, you won't like this one
But overall, the quality is great and the staff is friendly
Try the almond cookie ice cream
You won't be sorry
It's fantastic
Unique flavors in this place
my favorite is the Lychee
The cakes are great too
different fruity sorbets mixed with vanilla ice cream
delicious!
All I can say is YUMMMMMMM
I'll make the trek any day just to get my favorite almond cookie ice cream
If you want yummy FRESH NATURAL ice cream, with interesting flavors such as LICHEE TARO, it is worth to pay a visit to this tiny store located in the heart of Chinatown
The taste is DIFFERENT!
Real smashed up lychee, mango, longan tropical fruits go into the goods
Their classic chocolate series is also super-smooth and tasty
Gotta love their 70's retro t-shirt
Look for their store banner sporting the same logo of a greedy ice-cream monster
er, Chinese dragon? (Standing room only
)
the ice cream is so great
you will always remember its greatness
when you can come here
Only half a block apart, my choice is always the Factory
There are the yummy tasting regulars like vanilla, chocolate and mint chocolate chip, but they also offer amazingly cool ones, like green tea, lychee and pineapple
The kids that work there are always friendly and attentive
Oh, and you can always ask for a taste in case you're not sure you would dig a whole cup of red bean ice cream
Grab a cup and go pick up some souvenirs on the next block
The unusual flavors are the best here, the let you sample as much as you want
If it weren't all the way in Chinatown, I would take pints home!
i got the chocolate chip and then another day i got mint chocolate chip!! it was soooo good!! you have to go there!!
what can you say but, it's good
eat it in the street so you can let it melt on toyour hands and then drop it on the street
Rich, deep flavors
My particular favorite is the ginger, but others like the green tea
For good chowing, have some dumplings at Dumpling House on Eldridge St
, then pop on over here for dessert
It isn't healthy, it isn't light, but the flavors are intense and good
If you're looking for a place to please your taste buds and gratifiy your burning desire for dessert, this tiny place in the middle of Chinatown will tame that flame
All the flavors are great
The chinese fruit flavors are unique and well worth a try
Hey, where else are you going to find homemade lychee and green tea ice cream?
The Scene Thanks in part to the fact that Nobu belongs to the Drew Nieporent-Robert De Niro restaurant syndicate, the restaurant has become a little Hollywood East
There's a palpable anticipation of celebrity sightings from a crowd that's equal parts nouveau riche and seasoned, in-the-know foodie
The sleek, Japanese-accented interior--by star restaurant designer David Rockwell--is an impressively calming space
The Food The densely flavored sweet black cod marinated in miso is Nobu's signature item
Another jaw-droppingly good choice is the squid "pasta"--tender pieces of squid and crunchy asparagus, coated with a rich butter and garlic sauce
As one would expect, the sushi and sashimi are decadent
Omakase dinners here are legendary, and easily eclipse Alain Ducasse in price
My fiance I went here for my last night in NYC and were really torn between the $120 tasting menu that everyone told us to get, or the much less expensive a-la-carte that seemed to provide exactly what we wanted
We finally decided we would always wonder if we didn't try the tasting menu and did it
DON'T DO THIS! Unless you only want small tastes of very high-end dishes (like kobe beef, which was amazing), do your own thing! We were hungry right up until the end, when we reminded the waiter that we had requested the famous Black cod miso as one of our dishes and later found out he added it on top of our already ridiculously expensive bill
He kept asking us if we were still hungry, but I guess that meant if we said yes he was planning on adding that on as extra! I did enjoy the yellowtail jalepeno, the wild alaskan salmon sashimi salad, and the salmon sushi at the end, but I would have enjoyed even more a la carte softshell crab roll, more maki rolls, etc
And we were traumatized by the $380 bill, when we'd only had two drinks each
Don't get sucked in by the hype, take Nobu for what's it worth and get a deal by just ordering off the menu
I can't recommend Nobu highly enough
It is stylish and posh, but not over the top
The food is simply to die for
The toro tartar is silky sinful goodness
The yellowtail/ jalapeno sashimi is delightful
The miso cod is famous for a reason
it's a must-have
So tender and yummy
The kobe beef is the best I've had anywhere
And the lychee martini made with sake is refreshing and delicious
I just love this place
Phenomenal sushi , pricey, but worth it (Plan on making reservations far in advance)
Not an everyday kind of spot , but great for once a year special ocasions, and for bringing out of town friends for the celeb gawking and great food
we came here in january for the $120pp omakase menu
my expectations were perhaps too high due to nobus reputation, and i was kind of disappointed
our waiter seemed to be absent a lot so water glasses went unfilled and requests unanswered often
the food, when it came, was good but not special
miso black cod is now served at restaurants all over town, so though nobus version was perhaps slightly better, its taste is just too familiar to be special
their citrus wagyu beef was oddly reminiscent of sweet and sour meat
sashimi salad was really good (small slivers of tuna filet in a citrus-sesame sauce)
dessert (lychee granita followed by the molten chocolate cake + green tea ice cream bento box) was also good
overall, im glad i went to see what the hypes about, but am not overly excited to go again
it's all hype
the food tastes like stuff you would get in fancy restaurants in vegas
all show, and too much sauce and salt
it is amazing how this one branch is now a chain of good sushi and food
very expensive but certainly recommended
Nobu was wayyy too expensive for me
The staff was not friendly and impolite
I felt out of place
Dine at Nobu if you can afford high prices for small portions
We had the omakase and overall, it was good
It was a bit on the pricey side but consider the ambience and the NOBU name, its definitely worth a try
The food was good, especially the tuna tartar and the oyster in their special sauce
YUM! If you can spare the extra buck, go there for a treat
I was so excited when I got reservations to Nobu for my boyfriend's birthday
We were seated immediatly, and at the table over from Jay-Z! The food was just perfect
The service was seriously lacking though
Drinks took a long time to arrive, and I had requested a special dessert for my boyfriend, and they brought the check without bringing the dessert! When I went to speak to the waitress, she said she was still brining the dessert, she hadn't forgotten (?)
After waiting an additional 20 minutes, we just got up and left
Aside from our waitress's limited skills, we had a very enjoyable dinner and would go back in a minute
If we could get reservations again!!
I have been to Nobu three times and each time I was very satisfied

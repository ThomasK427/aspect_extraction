The mango summer rolls were only OK
The place was jammed but our server was professional and friendly
The music was a bit loud but the song selection was great, so we blew off desert and had another round of drinks at the bar
They don't have DJ's anymore but one of the waiters is a DJ and his mix CD's are played on the weekends
All in all, we plan to go back
I live nearby and frequent all the Thai restaurants in the area
While Long Tan has the greatest bar (the drinks are awesome, especially the plum wine sangria, and they have a second happy hour 11pm-1am!), I have to say the food is disappointing
Everything is more expensive than other thai-owned restaurants nearby, but blander, less creative, with less fresh ingredients
Don't be fooled by the creativity of the menu, most of the food is just not good
Also, Long Tan is the kind of place where trendy=servers who are too cool for school
I don't like it when servers don't really know anything, and are kind of rude and inattentive
The decor really is beautiful inside, but if you want good Thai food go elsewhere
Stick to the bar at Long Tan
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef, and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways
Instead of being pan-Asian, I thought it was simply a creative take on Thai cuisine
and I'd much rather have innovation with traditional Thai spices than another unremarkable noodle dish
Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over! Our waitress was sweet and accomodating, not overbearing
The music does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of corriander
but I wouldn't wanna live there
I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant
It was nice and fresh, but I can't give it high scores on being authentic thai
The food was very good, but not very thai
If you'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent, Long Tan is a good place on the slope
wow! how have i missed this one ,tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew
this restaurant reminds me why i love brooklyn ,the food is great the ambience is fun and the service is very friendly and get this the prices make most restaurants look like rip off joints
do yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me
this restaurant keeps getting better ,the curries and the daily specials seem to have taken a major leap in the right direction
i love the ambience the owner and the staff work over time to make your dining experience a great one
my girlfriend and i think that this is the best thai food in brooklyn and we should know we have tried all the available thai restaurants,the food is spicy enough without hurting anyone but if pain is your thing then mention to your waiter that you like things hot and the long tan kitchen will do the rest
just remember to order the house cocktails such as the ginger kamikaze or the moscow mule to add to your experience
Based on the reviews on this site, I was looking forward to my meal
However, the beef satay was tough and tasted more like char than the (not) 'spicy' peanut sauce
And, the chicken and coconut soup came with mushrooms (not listed on the menu), which I am allergic to
When I sent the soup back, I was given the same soup, reheated, with the mushrooms merely picked out--meaning still in the broth
The waitress was MIA for most of our meal
With the very few people in the restaurant, I expected to see her more than once every half hour
She must have been having a bad night, b/c she was also brusque
However, the manager (owner?) was very helpful when I asked for directions, and the drinks were very good (and strong)
Still, I was let down, and my boyfriend hated it
We will not be going back
I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try
' And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back
The food is very average
the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here
The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt)
Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari
The decor is night tho
but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling
its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern
Last Friday, a group of us stumbled into this place and had a great time
The DJ was playing great stuff and mixing like a champ
The drinks were original and refreshing and when the kitchen closed, the bartender invited us to relax in the garden
My girlfriend and I were curious about the menu and returned Wednesday for dinner
The lobster rolls were awesome! Mai fun noodles were not so great but we really enjoyed the moo shoo pancakes and the coffee cheese cake
Also impressed with our waiter, who was super friendly and professional
All in all, fun bar for the weekends and the menu is a great value
We'll be back!!
While waiting for a table These jerks blew me and my friends off for almost an hour
(a smaller group of three)
When we finally asked what was going on, the host interupted me to usher in the third (larger) group of hipper and thinner people, only to get back to me with a vague 'another 10 minutes'
I have eaten here before, and the food is blase to say the least
If you want mediocre Thai, stop in here only when the place is slow, because when it gets busy, they treat customers like cattle
This spot NEVER disappoints! The food is always excellent, the service is generally solid and most certainly non-intrusive
The house-cocktails are interesting-and-stiff
Their Mojito is definitely the best I've had in Brooklyn, if not in all of NYC
It is crisp, clean and minty- unlike many mojitos that conjure thoughts of spiked-Country-Time-Lemonade
Hang-and-drink in the slightly minimalist bar/lounge area or eat in the dining room or Zen-like-garden
The menu: a perfect blend of more traditional dishes and nouveau-Thai, all excellent values (though a recent price hike has changed that slightly)
I haven't had a dish there that wasn't intensely flavored, just as any quality Thai should be
The currys are marvelous; order the red curry with duck- sort of Long Tan's take on a curried duck-confit
The grilled version with tamarind sauce (using duck breast this time) is tender-peppery-sweet-tangy
Now if only they would bring back those Juniors pork-rice-garlic sausages
This is my first review on Citysearch, and I'm only writing it because the last reviewer (brooklynguy) has no idea what he's talking about
I live close and have been hanging out at Long Tan for almost a year
The late weekend bartender is such a sweetheart
He always makes me and my friends feel welcome, and makes fantastic drinks
(Sometimes I even have to tell him to make them weaker
) Plus, it hasn't been crowded on the weekends for months, so what is he talking about? (I'm not complaining--I hate standing it a crowded bar
) And what is a different crowd? Maybe brooklynguy should move back to the upper east side so he can be with his own kind
I usually hit Long Tan's bar with friends early in the week
It's a great spot where grown-ups can linger over cocktails, joke with the bartender and listen to slightly offbeat music that is never too loud
After a couple of drinks, the apps--I like the lobster/mango summer roll and the cripsy squid--go down great
Come in more than once or twice and the bartenders and manager/owner remember your name and what you had last time
A true neighborhood spot
Comfortable and fun without any pressure
If you go on the weekend, go early
The late bartender is lame--and he makes lousy drinks (he didn't chill the martini glass on a cosmo and barely muddled a mojito) and the place fills up with a different crowd
This is my favorite place to hang out! I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about regarding the service
My husband and I go there almost every weekend, and we never have a bad time
Everybody says hi, from the bartenders, the waiters, the chef and the owners
And this is the only place that we don't ever get an attitude -- the atmosphere is always pleasant (especially the outside dining in the summer) and the crowd is never rowdy
Hey, if you think your waiter is bad, you should tell the manager or owner and not tip the waiter
And if you are wondering why nobody recognize you by now, probably you should introduce yourself and start a conversation
I love this restaurant! The food is great and reasonably priced-- the yellow curry is delicious and, for dessert, the mango sticky rice is the best! It's also a pleasant environment, especially the garden
The only downside is the service-- my boyfriend and I go there fairly regularly and you'd think *someone* there would recognize us by now, but they never do
Oh well, small price to pay for the great food and fun atmosphere
I will admit that Long Tan is visually appealing but that's about it
Me and my dinner companions waited FOREVER for our appetizers to come and when they did, they weren't hot

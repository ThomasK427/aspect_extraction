If you are on a budget, then this is the place to come to have great food at very cheap prices
It is a family oriented restaurant
I really recommend it
Pupusas are a must try with a refreshing drink of Horchata
Seafood lovers, you've got something coming when ordering the seafood platter
TERRIBLE - One time I returned a stale cake which I brought to a family member's home
I was insulted by one of the owners
She was insisting that I didn't like the cake and that is why I returned it
That bakery never saw me again
In Short The shiny black tables and chairs in this bare bones cafe are perpetually packed with teen couples, old paisanos from the 'hood and ice cream afficianados diving into some of the city's best housemade gelato
Flavors range from standards to hard-to-find Italian options, like tiramisu, hazelnut and zuppa inglese
Other temptations include spumoni, tortoni, cannoli, cookies (try the pinoli), tarts and fluffy white cakes to order
Best espresso
Can be served at the bar or in cafe!
This place used to have wonderful, intensely flavored gelato
No more
I suspect that they have begun to buy their gelato from a factory rather than making it themselves
The coffees and the pastries are nice, however, and the atmosphere is wonderful
DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT
EAT AT WASABI
THE SUSHI WAS TERRIBLE AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF I SAW TWO RODENTS RUN OUT FROM THE KITCHEN WHEN I WAS LEAVING
THEY WERE AS BIG AS CATSS
NAUSEOUS AS I AM TYPING!
This is some of the freshest sushi I've had in NYC
The waitstaff is attentive and the prices are quite reasonable
As far as I can tell most of the negative reviews here are due to their non-vegetarian-friendly menu
Don't expect a whole lot of California-style sushi; this place is more traditional
For those who are meat-eaters, or for those who just want delicious basic sushi, I highly recommend Wasabi
I hadn't been to Wasabi for a while and just moved back to Williamsburg
I was very pleasantly surprised by how fresh the fish was
Great outdoor seating, too
Order veggie soup and they delivered beef
So we called and they accused us as being liars!  So we brought the soup back over and asked again for a refund or a replacement, and again the hostess accused us of ordering the beef even though we're both strict vegetarians
I couldn't believe they would accuse us of lying in front of other customers, and after we had walked all the way over
Having just moved from the village to Williamsburg I was a little concerned about my new food choices -- especially delivery and the ability to satisfy a sushi fix
I've eaten there once and had delivery several times
No, it isn't Nobu
It is totally fine and acceptable sushi and the previous two entries seem to be slammig the place out of some sort of vendetta
You could do much worse
I ordered a delivery of vegetable gyoza
They delivered meat instead
Unfortunately, I did not know this and ate them before my friend realized that hers were not vegetable
When I called to ask for a refund, the manager was VERY RUDE and argumentative
I explained that I had not eaten meat in 11 years and he said, So, what do you want me to do? You should have known
HORRIBLE service
Wilted lettuce in the salad
The miso soup was bland
Go to other area Japanese restaurants like the one on North Sixth
the sushi wasn't good at all, and couldn't even satisfy my craving
i'd sooner eat deli pre-packaged sushi
to make matters worse, a vegan friend was recently served PORK dumplings
for shame
never again
The food at Frost's is excellent
I have been a loyal customer for years and I have never had a dish I did not like
The calamari and fish dishes are excellent, especially Fra Diavlo
The chicken sicilana is excellent! The staff is very friendly and the service is great
The portions are generous and the price is reasonable
the food is outstanding
i have been eating here for the 5 years i have lived in the point
the food is great
the calamari fra diavlo is heaven
best calamari i have ever had
After a year in Tuscany, when we took my daughter to Bamonte's she said it was the most authentically Italian flavored food she had had since leaving
The seafood dishes are simply superb and the wine list is superior and NOT gouge priced! Terrific value
great fun
A real NY secret if you only think NY means Midtown Manhattan
this place is the absolute pinnacle of Italian-American red sauce cuisine
From the maroonish wallpaper and the faux-bronze busts to the stately waiters in black bow ties, from the gooey lasagne with meat sauce AND sausage to the creamy oversized desserts, this place will take you back to the 50's
Bring your granny, bring a date with an appreciation for retro authenticity, but do come try Bamonte's
This place is the distilled essence of Brooklyn Italian culture
Have anything with red sauce (and almost everything has red sauce!) and enjoy!
I love this place! The vodka pork chops with sweet peppers are amazing!! Do not pass this place up just because you have to leave the island, for it will be you who misses out
I grew up going to Bamonte's
One of their waiters has been taking care of my family, starting with my grandparents, for thirty years
It is like going to my second home and the food is really great southern Italian cooking
Nothing pretentious, just good food
Bamonte's created the best appetizer I've ever tasted by blending together two of my favorite flavors - clams and bacon
Clams Casino is available at almost all Italian eatries, but Bamonte's does it best
They use large, crispy strips of bacon, fresh clams and the light red sauce that covers the dish is amazing even by itself
I recommend using your bread and sopping up the sauce
Or just eat with it a spoon, no one could blame you if you did
I grew up eating at Bamonte's for every special family occation
Now that we've moved from Brooklyn to Long Island we still make the trip for one of the best Italian meals NY has to offer
Not as pricey as the Manhattan scene and the portions are fit for a Roman Army
OK so the decor is a little old and tacky but it adds to the atmosphere
Leave room for desert if you can!
A true Italian Restaurant with a quiet history that is filled with the humble love of two generations of family
The Kitchen is only separated from its patrons by glass is immaculate and the service is undeniable heartfelt
Only the best quality food makes it through to their kitchen to be prepared and served to perfection
Patons here are considered family and it truly is one you will want to be part of
A very pleasant discovery
We went in from a bad snowstorm and found great food, a fun waitress and WARMTH!  I recommend the Spiedino and calamari! Reasonable prices and very good wine selection
Went here back in the summer when the outdoor seating area had a nice appeal
the service was horrible then and the food was decent
This time, the service was decent and the food was mediocre at best
Zucchini flowers stuffed with mozz were oil-laden and my beet gnocchi with shrimp was very disappointing
The small shrimp were dry and rubbery and when I sent the dish back to the kitchen, the waitress returned saying that they use 'frozen shrimp so that is wny they have that texture
' Fantastic
I would only go back to try the pizza and would not recommend trying Acqua Santa unless you feel lucky

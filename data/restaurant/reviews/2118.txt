The inside doesn't look like they have changed it in a long time, which is a good thing
If you enjoy an Old NYC dive bar atmosphere, with a truely scrumptous hamburger at incredibly cheap prices in the picturesque West Village, go to the Corner Bistro
Be there as early as possible to avoid the over-crowded conditions, and to get an opportunity to play the eclectic juke box without having to wait a few hours to hear your selections
Best burgers in Manhattan, friendly bar tenders and good neighborhood/corner bar atmosphere
Be prepared to wait for a table and/or crowd in the bar area, though, as it seems being rated as this place has been pretty crowded every time I've been there!
While New York wins the battle of having the best pizza in the country, LA may take the cake for the best burgers
But, The Corner Bistro is grilling up some tasty, tasty burgers that stand next to the city of angels best ground beef delights
TCB grills up fat, juicy burgers that border on orgasmic
One of the best burgers I've had ever
I think it's the onions
Great bar too, good late nigtht eats alternative
Crowded, yes
smoky, yes
But the food is great (love them burgers)and the bar has, with out a doubt, a lot of charm
Unbeatable
The best spot for brainstorming your next great hair-brained scheme, or plan to get rich quick while chomping on THE best burger on the planet and wash it down with a little McSorleys straight from the tap - how's that for a true New York burger joint
Whenever I have guests visiting, I always take them to the Corner Bistro for a meal
Great atmosphere and great locals!
This is the spot to stave off the most epic hangover with the flame broiled cure
Much is lost on decor and amenities, but the burger quality is nearly gourmet quality
This place is great, except for the fact that it can get crowded at peak times
Amazing burgers and great music all the time - very cool scene too
While the long wait for a table can be a pain, the burgers are the best--plain and simple
And the price is definitely right
You are guaranteed an inexpensive delicious and fun bite to eat
While the last few times I've been I'v left in a food coma, its well worth the painful roll home
Wear elastic and come hungry
Nothing is better than sliding into a hard wood booth, sipping a $2 ale, and knowing exactly what to order before you sit down
Corner Bistro is the only restaurant in NYC where I don't have to look at the menu and toil over what to order
The hamburgers are fresh, hot off the griddle, and served aside perfectly crispy, not greasy french fries
I love slathering everything in the spicy brown mustard they have
And the waiters are always astute and put line jumpers back in their place
If you are 20 years old and have no money this is a great place to go, as the prices are basically what McDonalds charge
The atmosphere is fun, but the burgers are lousy
if your idea of having a great time is hanging out at a cool joint, throwing back a couple of beers and eating awesome burgers, this is the place for you
Granted, the wait is long, but go when you are not too hungry, stand in line for a bit
By the time you get to the table, it'll have been WELL worth the wait
Fabulous burgers----when the waiter brought the check, we told him to hold onto it so we could order twice! Best, juicy, not-too-tightly packed, meaty burgers oozing delectable juice--not grizzle or fat! Tasty, fresh onions, Heinz Ketchup and cold beer or Coke in a glass mug
The place was full of locals/regulars and the wood bar and decor is a throw back to the last century! My new favorite REAL New Yorky place! Perfectly nice staff too!
Corner Bistro is NYC burger perfection
The perfectly packed double broiled chuck, literally drips with goodness
The meat melts in your mouth like filet mingon, and keeps with you to until you cleanse your pallet will a well-deserved mug of the good stuff
The fries are a la carte, and just Ok, but they're really just taking up valuable stomach real estate that could be saved for another helping of prime chuck
You have only 3 options, plain burger, cheeseburger, and bistro burger (BLT cheeseburger) but any more would only take away from the sublime perfection that is the corner bistro pattie
In terms of burgers, there is no other place you should go in the city
It's always crowded here and the burgers are always well worth the wait
This place is a must for anyone is not a vegetarian
This is the best package burger experience in town
Other places may have better burgers
or fries, or beer, but no place pulls it all together in a charming Village location like Corner Bistro
Go
Just don't take too long at your table and make the wait longer for the rest of us
I am a skeptic, always have been and always will be
But this is the best burger in town
The place, admittedly, looks like a hole
it's smoky, dirty, and loud
The locals seem hostile (rightfully so
this place is the worst kept secret in town), and the lines get long
But once you sit down, things are OK
A surly waiter takes your order, which unless you're clueless, is a Bistro Burger and fries
You'll barely have time to check out the amazing jukebox (full of jazz classics befitting an old Village bar, which this is) before your burger arrives
And what a burger
thick, amazingly juicy, and never burnt on the outside, with just a little seasoning
Piled so high with cheese, thick crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, and onions that you'll have to squish it before attempting to eat it
Perfectly complimented by the shoestring fries, it simply gets no better
CORNER BISTRO SERVES THE BEST BURGER IN NYC HANDS DOWN
THE BURGERS ARE ALWAYS COOKED TO FLAVORFUL PERFECTION AND GO BEST WITH A NICE BEER
Just plain god burgers and fries
Seating at lunch time is definitely tight, but you can usually find a spot at the bar
I have been a devoted Bistro regular for more than a year now because it's a bar, nothing more
These are the things any good bar should have: A great jukebox (check), a great bartender (Jeff's great, check), and great food (check)
Nothing more, nothing less
Add to that ridiculously low prices (I've heard the owner owns the building and doesn't need to rake in the cash) and it's almost always worth a visit
The $2 glasses of McSorelys slip into the gullet like satin, and the crusty neighborhood regulars are always good for a laugh
That said, the worst thing about the Bistro is that it's ridiculously packed any time between 6 p
m
and 2 a
m
I try to go there after I've been out for the night to top off my drunk
Anyhow, it's not for everyone, but those who like it will always return
Burger is fabulous, it's a heart attack on a plate but it is soo worth the wait, the hard to find location, and the cramped seating
CHeap beer, bistro burger is delicious and it is a smoking restaurant
i really can't complain
Burger was better than the usual fast food and greek diner grub
But is it the best? No
I have no idea why people or posers think this is the best burger in NYC
The best burger I had was in the Upper Eastside cafe/ diner on Lexington Avenue on 64-65 street
The absolute best burger in Manhattan
my only gripe is that they dont offer cheddar cheeseburgers, only American for those who're picky like me
When you're really hungry, go for the Chiliburger
YUM
really solid burgers, and they serve till 3 or 3:30 in the morning
waiter is slow, so order everything at once when you have a chance
in fact, double your drink order because you probably woin't get a chance to order a second time
actually, if there's a bar stool open, ust sit at the bar for the best service
Folks, don't even bother yourselves to go there
This place is just nooooooot goooood
I think the owners of the corner bistro must be posting all these positive reviews
I can't believe how many people consider this place the creme de la creme of burger joints
I went once a couple of years ago and never had the desire to go back

Get it to go or delivered
I hate lamb but they manage to make it delicious
Everything is so good, if it was located anywhere else, there would be lines out the door
I love this restaurant! I love everything about it and all of my friends and family love it too
The food is exceptional, the staff is cordial and often very sweet, the ambience is great with tiled tables and ALWAYS fresh flowers and the price is worth it
Yes, this place is more expensive than your typical burrito bar, but what you get is sooooo much better
The food is authentic, great for vegetarians and if you don't live in the city, do come out to Brooklyn for the best Mexican food the city has to offer
I highly recommend Chimbombo, the vegetable fajitas or papalote, vegetable chimichangas
Good options including combination menus
Mexican beer on tap
Reasonably priced and fun atmosphere
Good neighborhood restaurant
Cheap pitchers of beer, cheap food that just stopped kicking minutes before going on your plate, lots of burgers, ribs, sandwiches
Cannot believe I hadn't been here before
Good times
The Turkey Burgers are great at the Grand Canyon Restaurant
I always request mushrooms and cheese on my turkey burger
The turkey burgers are thick and juicy and they pile the mushrooms on! I love it
They are polite, but it gets very busy around lunchtime, so call to place your order early if you want them to deliver your food, because the phone line is continuously busy after 12:30pm
Been here several times b/c my boyfriend and I love the sushi boat for two! Fresh sushi at reasonable prices, and the service is really good
If you want a cheap, fast falafel, gyro or schwarma, this is your place
The namesake Tabouleh salad is fresh and can easily be shared
You can easily have lunch or dinner here for around $5
Nothing fancy here
Just plain good home cooking
Teresa's is a nice mix of traditional Polish cooking with a heathy mix of American
The prices can't be beat
If you take away the two most expensive meals (rib eye steak and rack of lamb - each $16), the meals range from $7-10 and include 2 sides
Although the service can be a bit brusque at times, the food is always good, hearty and hot
I recommend this restaurant to everyone
i ordered an omelet, my husband, pierogies
pierogies were cold, omelet was raw on inside
asked for oatmeal instead
oatmeal was cold! then, the waiter had nerve to charge me for the fruit salad and bloody mary (which we didn't drink) that came with the omelet (brunch special)
i said, i never would have ordered the fruit salad separately, it came along with the brunch
then he said, well, you ate it
of course i ate it, he brought it out 20 minutes before the omelet
i spoke to the manager, who did not apologize for the RAW food and haggled me over the 5
00 for fruit and drink (which we didn't want, came with brunch)
didn't apologize and ask to make it up to us, didn't try to accomodate us
spent so much time haggling, i got a parking ticket for being over the meter! NEVER eat here again
Teresa's delicious homemade Polish fare is as authentic as it is delicious
Nestled in BH's restaurant row, close to the Promenade, Teresa's location and cuisine is pristine
Breakfast, lunch or dinner - Teresa's serves up a hearty meal each and every time
Their white borsht (served on Saturday's) is to die for
The modest staff and affordability makes for the perfect refuge after a hike across the bridge, a jog by the promenade, or a day's worth of shopping
Enjoy!
The Polish food here is great, especially the pierogies, and it is very cheap
Breakfasts are also excellent; try the ricotta cheese pancakes
I grew up on Czech/Croatian food and Teresa's is pretty close to that
The Stuffed Cabbage is amazing along with the Pierogies and Kilbosa
Teresa's offers a large brunch/breakfast menu also
The blintz are out of this world
Henry's End is small, so it can seem a bit crowded
That's the downside of being a favorite though
The food is delightful--well prepared, tasty, and a great variety
The service is attentive, but not rushed
We've never been disappointed
It may seem a little pricey to some, but it's worth it
They only take reservations for parties of three or more, so go early if it's just the two of you
I went one week ago and I was very pleasantly surprised
There were 4 of us and 2 had the pre-theater
With dessert, the pre-theater is a great deal/meal
Not one meal, dessert or appetizer was anything less then perfect
The veal lemonese was out of this world as was the rasberry duck (better then the 4 seasons)
The blackened veal was tremendously good
The mud pie was also excellent
The wine selections are not to be beat
I would not hesitate reccommending this place at all
I highly disagree with the person who gave this place a 1
I have been to this restaurant many times and have never been disappointed
They're seasonal specialties are spectacular, especially their soft shell crab in the summer and game dishes in the winter
In addition, I've always found the waiters helpful with the wine selection, and there is always a good selection of wines by the glass
Also, many of the appetizers can be served as main courses as well, which is quite nice
The deserts are also very good, of which the Creme Broulee Napolean is the mouthwateringly good, with the Mrs
Mud Pie runnig a close second
Sidenote: If you fill out a card with your birthdate, you will receive a card in the mail to use within a week of your birthday for a free entree
This little neighborhood spot is a jewel
fabulous food, interesting wine list, excellent (and really nice) staff
If you want a great night out, go to Henry's End
The Wild Game Festival (in the Fall) can't be beat
I've never had a bad meal here
The duck is the best around and you have several choices of how you'd like it prepared
Fish is also terrific and there are always some yummy specials
The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxed, truly one of the best restaurants in NY
I am a native New Yorker and have been eating here since 1986
and the food, the people and the location is the best
I now live out of town and every time I go home I'm there
The people who gave it a bad reviews must not be use to great food
I have had various dishes from Indian places in and out of New York, and still rate my India House as the best !!!!  Hey they will even be my caterer this year for the big 50 celebration, and continue to wow me EVERY TIME I GO HOME
Ive been going to this place since 1985!! 20 years later the same guys are still thereI love them and their non-yuppie food
I love the Aloo Paratha and Veg
Curry
The service was good and also the food
I will go back again and again
Though the service here is very attentive, the food is awful
Even the veggie samosas weren't great! It's fattier and less flavorful than any other Indian place I've been to in New York
Cobble Hill/Bkn Heights and vicinity is a barren wasteland for Indian food
This restaurant continues that shameful trend
Without a doubt, the WORST Indian food I have had since moving to NYC

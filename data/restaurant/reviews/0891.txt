we started with the bread pudding and vanilla sorbet amuse, both had such unbelievable flavors, then we shared the amazing Cheese cake, the Pineapple Gazpacho, and the Chocolate tart with Pink Peppercorn Ice Cream, which was hands down the best Chocolate dish i've had in a very long time
but the real kicker was when i ordered coffee (best in nyc), i made a joke about also ordering an umbrella since it had just started raining outside, and the waiter went downstairs and got us one! how's that for service
Everything about the scene here is cool
The bar is sleek and the cocktail is good
The dessert was great and the portions were perfect
Service was great
Overall a great experience
People get fooled by the ambiance when judging this place
I admit, the atmosphere is quite romantic, and the service is quite wonderful
The wait, however, can be a bit long at prime time
I phoned and was told to arrive by eight if time was limited
Good advice
These desserts are truly fresh and innavative, but not in an inventive way
just in a traditional kind of way
I believe I would wait the prime time line again
depending on the quality of conversation with my companion, of course
We ordered dessert and wine
Afterwards, we tried to order coffee but were told that we had to leave b/c there were people waiting to be seated and we should have ordered the coffee in advance
WHAT?! We wrote to the Chikilacious website address, the owner said he was the waiter we have to understand that this is N
Y and everyone should know that you can't linger at a table once you've been served
I didn't realize ordering coffee after eating was lingering
Anyway I wouldn't go back there again even for free - the rushed atmosphere horrible service were bad enough, but on top of that the the owner just doesn't care about the customer's experience
He wants you to move along so he can make more money!!
ChikaLicious was such a wonderful experience in so many ways
I have been lucky enough to dine here twice and both times were amazing
The dessert is wonderful especially the Fromage Blanc - never have I had Cheese cake that is so fabulous
The service is perfect - attentive and they move you along so you are not sitting for 2 hours between each course
Once we had wine pairings which was fun and once we chose our own wine - both were wonderful
The dessert is truly over the top and the experience is worth every penny
A total special occasion place, but lacking a bit in size - don't particularily like cramped quarters
All in all, I am so happy to have ChikaLicious in New York!
The spare decor sets off this place's specialty-- the gorgeous desserts! I love the warm chocolate tart, but everything has looked really beautiful
The fromage blanc is a chef's specialty
Chika is an artist, no doubt about that
The wine selection complements the desserts nicely
Don't show up hungry, though
Your entire meal, all three courses, would probably fit in the palm of your hand, no joke
Everything from the time we stepped foot into ChikaLicious was exquisite
Marble countering creates an elegant and welcoming atmosphere
The gracious and attentive owners are knowledegable and not at all overbearing or condescending
The desserts were wonderful - delightfully tasty and imaginative amuses and entrees
Been coming here for three years
Desserts were $12 dollars then, and now
Unbeatably solid and refreshing desserts
every time
Marvelous three course prix fixe with warm service to boot
Moving soon across the street
Good thing for the loyals who tend to brave the elements
Charming place
Great concept, but they fail to deliver
Too pricey, yet nothing we had was worth raving about or going back for
The polished desserts were astonishingly delicious, and the viewing of chefs preparing my dessert in front of me was really very unique and fun
Plates and glassware are artistically beautiful and lend to an overall feeling of elegance not often seen in many restaurants let alone a restaurant in the E
Village
Wonderful venue in which to spend time with virtually anyone
ive been here more times than i care to count
and ill continue going
its just SOOO good
portions tend to be a lil on the small side
but with 3 courses of desserts
u want to save room for your next course
i especially LOVE sitting at the bar and watching Chika do her magic
sooo educational, almost wants me to go home and have a go at it by myself
but why bother when i can come eat her creations!!  i think the menu changes 3 times a week
and remember, closed on Mon and Tues!! =)
i completely agree with the person that said it was overrated
ChikaLicious is perhaps the most intriguing dining I've ever experienced, anywhere
The professionally prepared and plated desserts are delicious and challenge the palate throughout all three-courses
When our restaurant suggested we have dessert at ChikaLicious, I thought it a ploy to kick us out (probably was) to make room for another serving of a complete meal
No matter, I actually enjoyed visiting another location for dessert, and will look to do so again
Wonderful way to complete a perfect evening
Phenomenal show with tasty desserts to boot! You must wait for the counter to get the full visual of the presentation
Very small place
Go early or prepare to wait a while
WORTH IT!!
Brown Sugar Panna Cotta, Fromage Blanc Island Cheesecake
absolutely scrumptious offerings enjoyed over the weekend
Decided to skip the movie this weekend and enjoy the Chikalicious experience
Considerably easier on the wallet for authentic entertainment and delightful dessert
I was very dissapointed
I think chikalicious is the biggest rip off I have ever experienced
I have never felt so cheated
I expect a dessert bar to make my mouth water, instead it made my pocket dry
I was overcharged for serving sizes that wouldn't satisfy a two year old, And the desserts wer not that appealing
in fact they were rather bland
I do not recommend this place unless you like throwing away money
I would have rather take the twenty dllars I spent and thrown it in the trash
Is what this tiny little jewel resembles
The chefs are professional and the desserts are to die for
Get the wine pairing for an additional 7 dollars and you'll float away into dessert heaven
The Honey Parfait in Concord Grape soup, yummm!! Simply divine composition, as was my granny smith sorbet with brown sugar panna cotta amuse
Read of ChikaLicious in an Isreali magazine
So thrilled of our decision to have included it on our top ten to do in Manhattan
They charged us $19
00 for prefix WITH NO DRINKS (They charged for the drinks separately)
It might have been their mistake but still, they shouldn't make such mistake since their place is really tiny and take care of only small number of people at one time with just 3 deserts
People there were friendly to their friends but not new customers
Maybe their idea is interesting and something special, I can live without it
I really don't understand how this place gets these recommended reviews, either
I agree with someone saying, it seems like fake

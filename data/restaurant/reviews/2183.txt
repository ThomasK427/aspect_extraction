Lobsters are big and beautiful, but often over-cooked
work in the Grand Central area, by far the best lunch in town for just $20 bucks! The filet mignon is good, not the best, but good
With the lunch special you get a salad, main course and a slice of cake
The lobster salad and Steak salad are the best I've had
Very crowded and noisy, quick sitting for lunch
Staff can be a little rude but prompted
Staff was also on the geriatic side, but perhaps they were the first to work there when the restuarant opened
The decor is a tad tacky, with cartoon celebs on the walls, but historical at the same time
To sum it up great for lunch!
Still a great steakhouse
Loud, Proud, and still draws a crowd
The Palm Too is a place where carnivores come with expense accounts in hand, and ravage through some steaks without having to pay for them
Sure, its loud and sure its crowded, but this is the charm of the place
If you don't like it, don't come
For that matter, stay away from Sparks, AngeloMaxies, and all the other steakhouses
i ate here for the first time last weekend
the staff was knowledgeable and friendly
the tuna steak cooked rare was heavenly and the mashed potatoes tasted home-made
WHAT A STEAKHOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO BE!! FROM STEAK TO LOBSTER TO MONDAY NIGHT SALAD TO SIDE DISHES-A FEAST FIT FOR A KING!
seating was slow and the host was beyond rude
the steak was good but not the best i have tasted
the sidedishes were nothing spectacular
The decor was tacky and very far from grand like some of the other steakhouses in the city
had another memorable dinner at the palm
have become a regular
steaks are always delicious, unlike some of the other city steak houses
the staff gets a bad rap that dates back to the 70's(hey zagats, lets let it go)
also have a 19
99 lunch special with decent sized steaks
theyre chicken ceasar might be the best in the city
A truely fine dining experience! The quality of the service is only surpassed by the quality of the food
The price may be a little steep, but quality is not cheap
An Italian friend, working for the Bank of Tokyo, took me here to lunch
Not only is the sushi super-fresh but, make sure you order the special rice with your meal - no other restuarant in the city that I've been to has served this authentic Japanese rice
Service: Poor
We ordered pork dumplings and got vegetable dumplings instead (barely warm and uninteresting to boot); we asked for chopsticks and they were flung on the table
I usually tip 20%, but these guys got a scant 15% and deserved less
Food: Bland
Even the duck sauce was sour, and the crispy noodles were stale
None of the food was really hot when it arrived and it all could have been a lot more flavorful and fresh
Prices: Absurd
$4 for four dumplings when $4
50 will get you six anywhere else in the area? $8 minimum per person? Not worth it at all
The service is non-existent (we had to fight with our waiter for him to not take our dishes away before we were done!) and the waiters are cranky in that authentic Chinese way but if you are interested in delicious food, this is the place
I came back from a wedding there this weekend and the food was awesome
The chicken and the peking duck were beautifully crispy on the outside and moist and succulent on the inside
The oysters and scallops were the among the largest I have ever seen in my life
this is a classic old school chinese banquet place
i've had a couple of events here and have attended others as a guest
there is usually lots of food and the food is good
they are very accomodating for planning events
and if you need a place for a dinner for a small to large group on short notice, this is a nice option
Being chinese i have had a lot of food, however this was the best peking duck i ever had
I'm willing to say, even better than in china
So roomy, great for banquets
I just went to a wedding at this restaurant
I will not even talk about the 'service', just can't believe how bad the food tasted
I have been to a lot of weddings, this banquet has to be all the way at the bottom
i
e
Peking Duck came in barely warm and soggy
Take my advice don't even bother with them
In Short This popular after-work hangout is a more casual alternative to the much larger, full-bore steakhouse in the same building, Smith and Wollensky's
The split-level room is packed to the rafters, and the bartenders shake stiff drinks and pour many wines by the glass
The Grill serves burgers, grilled meat and fish entrees and tossed salads, all of which which regulars order with obligatory hash brown potatoes and creamed spinach
I had lunch here and must say that the usual rule that you can eat cheaper at lunch does not apply to top steakhouses
I spent as much on lunch than I did at dinner in the main room (Smith Wollensky's)
$30 bought a fantastic steak with a couple of potato wedges
Add $9 for a side of delicious asparagus
Throw in a couple of beers but no dessert, no coffee, and with tax and tip it was almost $70
The service was just adequate; however, I loved the ambiance
The bartender, Patrick Ford, was live entertainment
That alone made it worth any amount of $ spent
Seriously, this guy is straight out of a movie
Knows all the locals, made out-of-towners like me feel welcome
Knows how to pour a drink, unlike anywhere else I tried in mid-town
Then the steak was excellent, with a nice side dish of creamed spinach
It's a hidden gem
If you dont know what to order
dont come here! The burger would be nice for lunch
but each and every time i come here I order what is NOT on the menu! the colorado rib eye steak
This steak is so pure in taste, nothing in all the premium steak houses I have been to can compare to it
Also try the seafood boquet YUM!
bad steak makes my boyfriend angry, whole chickens make me cry
steak was full of gristle and gristle is gross
so you could say that we didn't have a good time
so not good that i almost didn't pay their inflated bill
The Grill is a great place for a casual, yet high quality meal
The burger is among the best in the city, the bartenders are absolutely first rate, the service is fun and friendly, and the restaurant has a great community feel
If you're looking to spend a little more, get the cajun rib-eye
All in all, a great place for lunch or dinner
$13 for an Amstel?!?!?! No burger is that good
The waiter was obviously in a bad mood and we were definitely rushed
I can't believe I've been recommending this place for the last 5 years
I will not be returning
Like most NYC steakhouses
even this Grill that advertises lower prices is expensive
When I asked for something else in lieu of fries with my burger at lunch I was told sure
and then was charged $8 for a small (but good) green salad
Don't know about you but $23 for an okay burger and salad is a bit more than I like to spend on a casual lunch

What a great experience
Looks like good brunch menu too
My boyfriend and I came here when we walked by it the other night
It was a wonderful dinner! The menu has a wide variety of Italian food and a large brick oven pizza menu
There are also calzone, ravioli, risotta specials of the day
The wine is cheap, the beer is cold
Wonderful
maybe I am a little biased because I live nearby
But I also live by many other Italian places on 2nd Ave, and 4th which don't live up to this place
A cozy/casual place with outdoor dining, and intimate booths
Pastas and the oven-brick pizzas are great and not expensive at all
The bar is cool while waiting for the table
but rarely do you have to wait long for a table
it never gets crazy and is definitely bigger than Frank
Has a cool rocknroll bar/lounge downstairs too
Sometimes the lighting is a little too low and i gets kinda sleepy
Focaccia bread is the BEST!!!!!
Three of Cups is not only a great place for a larger group of people it is great for just a romantic twosome or even with your children!! The staff is so attentive and friendly
I can never decide which to order the pizza or the pasta because both are so yummy
If you feel like extending your evening I highly reccomend heading downstairs to the lounge where the dark, cool rock n roll bar awaits you
Run don't walk to this multi talented italian oasis of good food and good wine all you need to provide are your good friends
I was in charge of planning a group dinner for one of my clubs at NYU
We went to Three of Cups, which was just a 15 minute walk from campus
The food was excellent, and they took the orders a la carte
Special thanks to the owner Anthony, who got all the food out on time, provided a great setup in the back for us, and really made it a great experience
Pasta was great
pizza was good but shouldn't be too hyped up
good for an appetizer
Highly recommended!
We've been coming here for over 4 years and consider it pretty much our favorite place in the city, having spent many New Year's Eves, birthdays and just regular casual dinners here
It's great with 12 people or just with 2
The food is delicious and what's more, the staff and the overall ambiance make you feel like it's home, even if it's your first time through the doors
A true find
I've gone 3 times and each time it was a pleasant experience
I've taken a date and we were seated in the side room, which provides a romantic, candle-lit atmosphere where you can share a great bottle of wine
I've been there with a large party the group was catered to with ease
All meals were brought out at the same time, piping hot the staff didn't seem flustered by our size
We were seated amid the dining area while great selections of music played and we watched passers-by
I've been there with a small group and we sat at one of their collosal booths along the aisle
Immediately, we received amazing foccacia bread and drinks came quickly
The prices are amazing! (buy 1 get 1 free pizzas from 6-7:30? how can you beat a $4 stone oven pizza???)
Three of Cups is wonderful
Thanks everyone!!!
I invited 11 of my closest friends for one of the most memorable dinners I have had in a long time
If you don't want to worry about prices and are looking for tasty food that is prepared with efort, this is the place to eat
All of the staff, even the owner, extended themselves greatly
The service was speedy and polite
For a large party reservations make sense
The food is impecable, starting with made to order brick oven pizzas as appetizers was a good idea!!! Thanks for the Good Time!!!
whenever my friends and i want to go somewhere laid back with pretty consistent food, this is the place we always go to
not to mention that you can smoke at the outside dining area
although the pizzas are not always consistent, overall its a good place to meet up with friends for a good and cheap meal
I went with a friend, was seated promptly
Food was very good, had the linguine fra diavolo
Waitress seemed overwhelmed, so the service wasn't so good
All in all a friendly place
had a party at Three of cups back in May and we had a blast(all 20 of us!)
the food was great, the service was wonderful (really sweet , funny and professional staff) and basically, just a great and inexpensive wonderful hang
go and enjoy yourself
!!
an absolutely wonderful hang that consists of terrific food, ( had the Cod over Arugula the other night and it was perfect!) great staff, and a welcoming and hip vibe
and for dessert, please get the apple cake with a glass of white or red sangria! Three of Cups seems to effortlessly do what others try hard to do; combine a cool atmosphere with great food
marvelous
The place looks great and has a hip crowd
However don't go here for food
You'll do far better for Italian food just around the block on 2nd Ave
Foods okay, great atmosphere but it's all ruined by the inattentive and unpleasent staff
If you all don't want to be in food service and deal with customers, you should either re-think your career path or lock the doors so people don't come in
This resturant is great for big groups
I went with 16 others and we had great food and good service for a very reasonable price
Plus, the music they were playing was amazing
There are many different types of pizzas (we tried 5) and all were delicious
So was the pasta with eggplant
3 of cups is great for parties
3oC, is a nice bar and a nice place to hang out, but this is a poor excuse for good food
Its a good thing its dark, so you can't see how bad your dinner is
I am continuously amazed at how some places on citysearch get rated so accurately, and then a place like 3oC gets on the Best of list
Go figure
Three of cups has great pizza and great food
i wouldnt say the best, but pretty damn good!! Great place to meet up with a group of friends!!!
I've been going to 3 of Cups since it opened
It's not the kinda place you run in and get a slice
It's sit down pizza
The non-pizza menu is excellent as well
I love the shrimp and pesto pizza especially
Thin crusted wood fired oven pizza
This place is good for drinks and leave at that
They can't make a simple spaghetti with white clams dish? With an Italian chef? Stick with the pizza and you'll have a passable dinner
We found this place by accident and the food was amazing! Cool atmosphere, although our waitress was less than attentive
The food made up for that though!
Cute little cozy place with a very attractive menu that's creative but not exotic and etreme
Took my girlfriend who loved it as well
especially the inexpensive wine list
I loved Three of Cups
It was a great little place with an amazing atmosphere
I was there Saturday night with some of my friends
The happy hour was great, $3 glasses of GREAT WINE
The bartender was great and sweet, not your usually NYC snobby attitude behind the bar
She made us feel right at home
Thanks Aimee!! I only wish there was a 3 of Cups in Chicago

Just one sip after my girlfriend got rom her mojito the service guy napped her drink from the table
We politely said to the barman that was no way to proceed
He replied in an unjustifiable angry mamner that four persons had said the same to him in that night and that the drink napper knew what he was doing
This is silly, if he heard the same story four times in a night then something was wrong woth the service
We forgot about this mojtio thing and continued to party with our friends, just to see that some other people in out group experienced the same thing
What a cheap, cheap way to increase your sales
Shame on you!!
I really enjoyed Suba
The food and wine are really amazing and the dinner rooms are small and intimate
I thought the service was a little slow and not attentive enough for the price but other than that I'll be back when I can afford to spend $60 on dinner! In the meantime, I'll go there for tapas, the bar or the very cool club downstairs
I went there recently for a friend's birthday, and very much enjoyed the experience
The moat around the dining room is cool, and ever dish was excellent
The wine list was great, and the host personally served us the wine
The service was good (a little rushed in the beginning, but they relaxed once they saw that we were consuming)
All in all, very satisfactory
From the moment we walked in I knew it was going to be a disaster
8 people for a birthday party, and the host at the front desk told us we would have to wait
we had reservations but it didn't matter we watched as more and more tables were seated
30 minutes after our reservations we are seated
Now the fun begins
*had to edit for citysearch*  Finally I had to go find the waiter, who was hanging in the kitchen, we hadn't gotten our entrees, but we had been seated for 2 hours! When the food came, it was almost good, but the lack of AC, bad service, and overall apathetic staff, from the HOST, to the MANAGER to the WAITER, ruined the experience
I can go on and on, but this place is terrible
Save your money, please
Went here for dinner last night and have to say the food and service were fantastic
If you read the reviews your expectations of ambience and trendy interior might be over-rated, it was an interesting space but I was still expecting more
Anyway, back to the food, we shared the appetizer shrimp which was very good then my friend had the ribs which are boneless and cooked to perfection, I had the main duck which was not as good as the ribs but excellently flavored then I had the spicy cake which I loved! My friends lemon layer cake dessert special wasn't anything spectacular
Service was outstanding which when combined with such great food would bring me back again
What a difference a nice staff can make
at such a swanky, hip spot as this I was expecting potentially a lot of attitude and got none, I actually got the polar opposite
The staff was super-friendly professional
The ambience is as romantic cool eclectic (sp?) as you can get in Manhattan
The food was an 8 out of 10, very good but not out of this world
I really liked my appetizer was so-so on my entree (the pollo assado)
They are very creative in their melding of different flavors, textures and tastes of the entrees
You won't be disappointed with the food, it's very good
but the reason you will recommend this place to your friends is all the other features of the restaurant, the service, the ambience, the staff
Enjoy
I highly recommend
Menu is also very cool, all entrees $24 and all appetizers $10
The was unattentive
My friend and I went out for a cigarette, and when we returned, our table had been given to another party- even though our drinks and unpaid bill were still on the table
The waiter made excuses but didn't ask the other party to leave
Then as we tried to go to the night club downstairs we were forbidden because I was wearing a coat
According to the mangaer restaurant policy was that all guests going downstairs had to check their coats
I was cold and didn't want to check mine and was therefore not allowed down to the bar
Has anyone ever heard of a restaurant or bar not allowing you somewhere because you were wearing your coat? Not worth it if you ask me
It was my girlfriends 30th birthday and I wanted to take her somewhere nice
Made reservations days in advance but was reminded of an old Seinfeld episode when the host told me that even though I had a reservation, I wasnt guaranteed a table
(??) Dcor is great
Food was decidedly unspectacular, and not cheap
Reminded the staff no less than 3 times to place a candle in our dessert
So of course what happened? They forget the candle
When I informed the host, he told me, I put it in the computer so the waiter shouldve seen it
Which of course, is snotty-restaurant-host for: I really dont give a ----
This was a special occasion for us and they simply didnt get that
Bottom line: Keep searching
You can do worse than Suba, but you can also do better
I knew Suba would be a romantic place to dine but I didn't have very high expectations of the food based on the reviews I read
I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised! I heard the restaurant recently changed chefs but the food is still great
The grotto is also a must-see
I would definitely come back
Suba is truly a gem
When you walk in, there is a beautiful, candlelit red lounge
The host is polite and attentive
Then, you descend the stairs
We were in the room surrounded by water
It was beautiful
If you're sitting on the sides, you're right next to the water, which is gently flowing
The food is DELICIOUS
I had the braised short ribs which were tender and delectable
It came with spinach which was wonderfully seasoned
My date had the duck which was succulent and just a dream
I had two delicious drinks and the service was quick, unobtrusive, and unfailingly polite
All in all, a simply wonderful place to go for a romantic evening out or for a night among friends
For the not rich like me, it's pricey, but worth it for a treat
The food was pretty good, but the service and ambiance were not
The staff was either rude or unattentive, and as for being romantic, it ISN'T! It has a young, hip and LOUD crowd, which doesn't make for a romantic date where you want to be able to talk to your date, and hear them! We ran about 15 minutes late for our reservation (I called to alert them) and when we arrived, we were rushed to our table and told that we needed to hurry up because they had another reservation for our table in an hour! Not impressed, and will never return
SUBMA, is exactly what it seems like
Romantic, friendly and professional service, food was pretty good for the buck
Nice selection of exotic cocktails, overall great place for your date
I have been to suba several times in the past two years
It has always been a great date place but with the addition of Alex Urena, the food is truly spectacular
As appetizers we had the tres crudos and the milojas, they were great
For our main course we had the paella and the short ribs and were not dissapointed
Service was up to par and the wine list has been substantially improved
All in all a great place
Weekends tend to be too crowded for my taste so stick to a midweek meal and you will not be dissapointed
Well worth the trip to the lower east side
I had wanted to try Suba for awhile and decided I would take my boyfriend there for his birthday
We were not dissapointed
I was worried after I read some of the reviews but we had a wonderful time
Our food and drinks were great and the place itself has a fun atmosphere
In all it was a great night
We found Suba to be very pretentious and the food to be very disappointing
Most of the food we ordered was so undercooked, it was almost raw
My sister atepork which was raw in the middle
My hake was also raw most of the way through, even after i sent it back for re-cooking
The place itself is nicely lit and has a nice atmosphere, but the very formal staff ruin it
At one point we had three staff members fussing around out table of four
Mojitos were good and prices werent bad but sides should be included in price as portions are tiny

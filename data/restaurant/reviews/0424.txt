The Food The menu features snacky French bistro favorites like salad nicoise, as well as roast chicken, duck and other hearty entrees
Start with rich duck rillettes on crispy toasts, or share an oversized endive-Roquefort salad
You can't select which farmstead cheeses will land on your tasting plate, but they're always well-balanced, if a bit small for the price
You can, however, match interior and exterior to create a sandwich of your choice: Favorites like andouille-mushroom-manchego and jambon-Gruyere with pickled onions are better on hot-pressed bread, while others, like creamy artichoke lardon, make excellent savory crepes
Heard good things about Paradou for a long time and finally got around to going
All I can say is I dont know why I didnt come sooner
The food is superb
Definitely much above standard NYC brasserie fare like you would get at Les Halles (which I love), and completely in a different league from Pastis or the completely inexplicable Sascha
Everythign we had was excellent - the foie gras, the lamb, the quail, the desserts were all finger lickin'good
The wine was good, but uneven
We had a wonderful St Joseph, but a very uninspired St Emilion
The service was attentive but not intrusive
They were packed and food took a little long to come, mostly the entrees, but once it did all was fogiven and forgotten
Definitely will be back
but probably mid-week rather than weekend
Was going to Paradou this for a birthday party with 15 people so was a bit nervous about going here when I read the previous review
Kept thinking about it when they sat us in their very pretty back garden as it was completely full
But our experience was completely different
Service was really great
Water was very cool, had great recommendation for food and wine, and had a great sense of humor
The food is really some of the best Ive had in New York
I had the foie gras which was really incredible, like silk
I had the lamb, which wasa very simple dish but had amazing flavor amazing and came with a delicious sauce
My friend had the most beautiful dish, cold salmon with purple potatoes
The Salmon had a tangy lemony crust and the potatoes were sweet and buttery
The desserts were fabulous also
Tried the banana chocolate mousse pyramid, and a white chocolate mousse dessert that came with an incredible slightly sour berry sauce and jellys made from rosewater and flower petals
Very beautiful and delicious dessert
We had a wonderful time
Even though they were packed, they got everything to us in time, and the service was really great and attentive
It was a great birthday for my friend
We felt really taken care of
Paradou rocks!!
Just visted this resturant on a Monday night with a party of 11 (we had a reservation)
The back patio was packed with people and it seemed like way more than the staff and kitchen could handle
We sat for 20-40min without water or bread and were basically ignored by the waitstaff
When we finnaly were able to order our main course did not arrive until 2 hrs later and after many complaints! The staff apologized saying the kitchen couldn't handle the amount of orders that night - maybe they shouldn't have booked 3 parties of 10 or more all at 8pm! We didn't feel that the staff did anything to make the situation better for us
It was a really dissapointing experience and I won't be going back
start with the crispy oysters, you never tase anything like that! and the foie gras? - to die for!
i had the poached salmon , and my wife had the beef cheeks, both where just perfect
service was ok
nice music
we were at the garden, it was a little tight but great ambience
i cant wait for the next dinner experience at paradou
I had recently returned from Paris and was sad to leave
For our anniversary my boyfriend surprised me by taking me to a quaint, outdoor French restaurant and wine bar in the very trendy meat packing district
The food was perfect, the wine was amazing, and the service was wonderful
Overall it was a brilliant recreation of a night in Paris, with the stars above and the music in the background
I would highly recommend it to anyone
I made reservations for 6 people and requested the garden
I was told that would not be a problem unless the weather interferred
I specifically chose this restaurant because of the outside dining
When we arrived and the weather was perfect, the hostess seated us in the Very small inside front dining area
I told her I requested to sit outside, she told me they never promise that!! In addition, she said they only use the garden for big tables of 8 or 10 and they didn't have any smaller tables
Well, I took a peek later on and there were plenty of tables of 2 and 4
She was pleasant, but the bottom line we were disappointed
Also, the waiter was rude
the food was ok and unfortunately, we did not realize they only served wine and beer
After the let down, I was looking more for a martini!
Although it is in the heart of meatpacking this place lacks all the pretense u find in the area and serves simple great food
The garden area is cramped to say the least esp with the fence surrounding the area
peaking over to the restaurant on the other side, one cant help but feel the grass is greener over there, at least garden space wise
i had a great goat cheese salad that didnt have too much dressing as a lot of places do
the herb crusted lamb was excellent
the sauce and rice side was good too
normally i wouldnt touch anything sort of carb but i ate some of the rice since it was that good
ended w a chocolate crepe which was yummy but very rich
overall nice time, got to eat outdoors, the place looks a lot nicer at night in the candlelight
try it out!
this establishment is the pearl of the meatpacking
with its distinctively intimate dining rooms and friendly, knowledgeable staff that seem to live vicariously through the diners' experience
the food is as comforting as it is delicious, the foie gras: indescribably good, specials that made me feel special, such as the poisson, salades that leave me refreshed and ready for more cheese and fantastic bordeaux(maucaillou)
kudos to paradou and the tall waiter with glasses for an unforgettable birthday experience
This place has the shortest pour in Manhattan
They must squeeze 8-9 glasses out of every bottle
Mean spirited
The food has been OK but never amazing and the service is generally poor
Its not cheap either
If you're in the area - seriously - and want French food in the Meatpacking District, you should go to Pastis and have done with it
PS The garden is crap
What a beautiful restaurant! Both the front room and the heated garden have great ambiance and totally transport you away from the city
My friends and I were so impressed with the food, the wine, the great music
and the service! The servers were attentive, friendly and really knew the menu which was great for my non-French speaking friends
We had the unbelievable lamb dish, steak, fish of the day, cassoulet, cheese, desserts and amazing wine! And the chef - what a character! He was kind, gracious and actually took the time to see how folks liked the food
and it was a busy night! The owner was also present and made it a point to see how we were doing
Very cool
Paradou is a surprising gem in the trendy meatpacking
We are definitely going back!
Last night we tried Paradou, and finally discover their new heated garden
Some couples were having a romantic diner in the front, and we gladly got a table almost immediately
We started with a great bottle of St Joseph, a selection of cheeses, and the rest of the evening happened to be just fantastic! I had the cassoulet (a cassoulet in NY, isn't it crazy?!) and my friends were amazed by the lamb and the fish of the day, a daurade en croute de sel, fantastically prepared
The staff was super friendly and attentive, the chef even came to say hi! The cherry on the cake was the wonderful singer, Nancy Danino, who dazzled us with her beautiful songs
We will brunch there on sunday, but I can't wait to come back in the summer, the garden is going to be all open, a quiet paradise in the city!
i found this place by accident last weekend and it was very busy! i obviously had no reservation but to my surprise the hostess treated my date and i like we were regulars!!the server was great helping to describe every dish on the menu!he also suggested a fantastic wine for our meals
the food and service is out of this world and we will definately be back!! we sat in the back of the restaurant and it has a terrific garden space
the vibe is great everyone around us was having an amazing time!!well done paradou!!!
Went here with friends for a birthday party this past weekend
Really a wonderful place
Great ambience
Great music

I really like the food of its' presentation and the taste is delicious
The service is excellent
I strongly recommend this Beet Thai restuarant to people who love thai food
First time I went, I just tried the basic Thai dish, green curry, wow it was the best green curry I ever had
Second time I tried off course Pad Thai off the lunch menu, it started to convince me this might be the best Thai place on 7th
Third time I thaught I should give it a try the unusual dish in Thai place, the Soft Shell crab in Thai herb sauce, I just found my new favourite dish, and totally convinced me the fav
Thai place
I definitely will come back for this dish and try out the new dishes
Decided to go there for lunch
no one else was there
we ordered (we thought) off the lunch menu
i had the panang, which was excellent
my friend had the crab, which was fishy tasting
and then we got the bill, we saw that they overcharged us (the crab was $15 instead of $8 as listed on the menu)
we told the waitress about the discrepancy
apparently we did not get the items from the lunch menu, but from the dinner menu
they charged us the lunch menu price, but only after telling us that it is up to the customer to indicate from what menu you're ordering! frankly, that's her job as a waitress
and if people come in at lunchtime and order something that's on both the lunch and dinner menu, she should have asked for clarification
I was impressed by its ambience (maybe a little too red, but still nice) and eclectic menu
I, unfortunately, had to put my coat back on and step out into the rain after ordering to be able to go to the bodega across the street to buy beer to accompany my meal
I ordered the mango and avocado salad which was a slice of an already darkening avocado on top of strips of mango
I had the tuna with butter garlic sauce on a bed of steamed vegetables
I enjoyed the entree but regretably my stomach didn't
it did everything in its power to purge the meal
Dessert options were kept to a basic minimum to quicken my departure, I presume, as they were closing the books for the night in front of me and ready to call it a night
It was not even 10:30pm
I have always wondered when a great Thai place would come Park Slope and now it has
We ordered lots of apps and dishes and everything was fabulous
Delivery is fast, too if you do take out, which I prefer because it can get crowded
I've been there many times
I love the lemongrass beef appetizer, which was wonderful, and I got the Miso Glazed Sea Bass, which was really good, and HUGE! The othertime, I got the Fresh Salad Roll, which came with this really great ground peanut vinaigrette
and then the chicken with chili basil spice which was lovely and really spicy
My friend got the honey glazed duck, which she loved
The portions are extremely generous
And it's BYOB at the moment, which is really nice
I've had the potato-corn croquettes, very fresh and good
The panang curry is awsome their portion is generous
And they are willing to do both veggies and tofu for us, even though the menu specifies one or the other
Their spicy basil sauce is very fantastic I've heard great things about their Jumbo shrimp and Scallop with brown butter sauce
It is on 7th Ave
between 9th and 8th
We arrived to a line of people waiting
We put our names on the reservation list
After watching numerous couples get seated, and we were the last couple, we were ready for our table as a table opened up
But a group of 3 women arrived and were seated at the free table
When we confronted the hostess, she told us that there were 3 of them and only 2 of us, and that the 3 women had a reservation at 8:30pm
It was 9:30pm
When we complained, she just shrugged her shoulders and said sorry
I won't eat there based on their bad managing skills
Good staff know how to manage a steady stream of customers, not to turn away people
I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant for weeks, and have to say it was well worth the wait! The food was delicious, and in my opinion, very reasonably priced
I do reccomend arriving early to avoid the dinner rush, as there is limited seating and it seems to fill up pretty fast after 7pm
I love that it is BYOB, there arent enough of these restaurants in the city
Overall I urge the locals to give it a try, definately a step above rice thai
I've tried a few Thai places in Park Slope and all of them were ok
Beet is a nice addition
It has a great ambience and the food is delicious
I've actually taken a few friends there and they were all impressed
I would definitely reccommend it
I can be understanding when a restaurant is new
When takeout lunch takes 25 minutes to make with only two tables to serve and no other takeout orders to prepare, it's ridiculous
They were out of one dish we wanted, and the others we got were only ok
After eating at the nearby Rice for so many years, I figured any Thai place that wanted to compete would have to take it up a notch
Beet does not
Went to a singles party there a few weeks back, and loved one of the complimentary hor'deurves, so went back with the guy that I met at the event, and asked for a variety of appetizers to figure out which one was the one i liked
Loved them all, but liked the chicken kara age the best
Quiet and romantic, going back for our one month anniversary!
Had a sweet Asian girl as my waitress who suggested great rolls for a sushi-newbie as myself
Was a little scared of raw fish, but it tasted great
She even made me easy-to-use chopsticks!!   Meal came out to $70, included edamame, 3 rolls, 2 martinis and 2 beers
Didn't try the desserts, we preferred to drink instead! ;)
the food is so tasty here
i dont usually eat sushi because i hate when it has that fishy taste but there was none of that here, everything is so fresh
try the firebomb/firecracker roll- cant remember which it was
i cant believe the last review
beautifulprincess must be the cheapest person alive
she went with a family of 5 and spent $80 for fresh sushi and thinks that's expensive?!?! some people should just stay home if they can't afford otherwise
and who in the world memorizes the cost per item?  i've been to hundreds of sushi restaurants in the city and the food really stands out
definitely not your run of the mill
dont! order a california roll here, far too many options
I graduated on Friday the 23rd and I wanted to celebrate with my family by going out for some sushi
I came to this site to find a nice place to go and sushi twist looked great
I had my 2 little brothers, my mom, dad and I
The review said that it had great food, good service, great prices, and that it would be good for kids
When we walked in, immediately I was surprised at how dimly lit it was
We were seated immediatley but we could barely read our menus because it was so dark, we had to use the candles on the tables to read the menu
We ordered an appetizer(shrimp tempura) which only came with 4 pieces but cost $9
we waited at least 20 min for that simple dish
each of us ordered sushi
My dad never had sushi so he ordered a sushi appetizer for $12
it was very simple and only came with 4 peices
Completely overpriced
My little brother got a yellow tail sushi for $7 and my mom got a spicy salmon roll for $9 also, not bad
I got a Tokyo triangle sushi for $15
The pieces were huge and delicious
We ate and paid $6 for 3 sprites, dad paid $6 for a corona (beer) we were ready for dessert
I got banana brulee for $6 which came with 2 cherries, 3 chocolate covered strawberries, and a banana cut up in 4 peices with a crisp sugar coating (only on 2 of the bananas)
It tasted like something i could have easily made at home
My brother had the creme brulee which tasted like burnt milk on top but tasted okay
The main problem with the dessert was that it took almost an half an hour to arrive! At one point we were ready to say forget it, just give us our check! it was'nt even that good

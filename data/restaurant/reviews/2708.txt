This place has the best pizza in the city! Real 'neighborhood' ambience
Go with the suprema (fresh mozzarella and crushed tomato)
The finest pizza in the city, no contest
I live two blocks from Caruso but i will walk an extra ten blocks to get my pizza from Sal's
Even if i did like the sesame seed crust (which I don't), the pizza is floppy and soggy
They say pizza is like sex - even when it's bad it's still pretty good
Not in this case
I love the sesame seed crust!! Pizza is good
Don't order mushrooms
they're from a can
Pepperoni is tasty
They have reasonable prices and deliver quickly
The Scene The vibe is thoroughly relaxed, perfect for a lazy Sunday evening, ingenious for a first or second date
Checkerboard-print tablecloths drape the tables, pictures of Pavarotti, Sinatra and Brando cover the walls and, nine times out of 10, it's either the voice of Old Blue Eyes or the Italian tenor that emanates from the jukebox
Even if you're not Italian, you feel like family
The Food Grimaldi's crust is thin and crisp, thickly redolent of smoke and char; the sauce is savory, full of chunks of fresh tomato and warming flashes of herb; the toppings are wide-ranging, from brilliant bits of fresh sausage to strips of house-roasted red peppers; and the homemade mozzarella, which is dropped in small gobs on the sauce, is the perfect final touch
I am always amazed at the looong line outside this place
Although this is probably why it stays so popular
(Hey, it must be great
Why else would all these people stand on line for so long - unless they're idiots?) I went early, with friends, so avoided the robo-linewaiters
The staff was blase, and the eagerly-awaited pizzas were - ok
Not earth shaking, not gastro-bliss-inducing
Just ok
I have much better pizza many times elsewhere
It wasn't terrible here, just - eh?
The place is overrated
Try Di Fara on E15 Ave J and will see the difference Thats the best pizza in Brooklyn
I can't say whether this is the best pizza in town, since I haven't tried it all
I also can't say whether it is worth the wait, since we arrived early just before the line formed
What I can say is that it was definitely some very good quality pizza, no matter what area of the world/style of pizza you are used to
I listened to the reviewers and stuck with only black olives as a topping, while my husband tried the pepperoni
The limited number of toppings prevented the sogginess described by other reviewers and allowed the intense flavors from the fresh ingredients; sauce, mozarella, basil and black olives to really shine through, without being watered down from too many extra toppings
If you are the type to care about fresh ingredients and cultural/regional traditions, you're going to love it
If you think Domino's is great, I still think you'll like it, even if it gets a little soggy for your tastes for lack of canned, processed ingredients; just eat it fast!
It was my first time at this pizza joint last night, and I was impressed with both the service (we got seated within 1 minute and they had taken our order within 3 minutes of sitting down
Our pizza was on our table within 5 minutes after that) and the food was great too
As mentioned previously, this is a thin-crust, brick-oven pizza
For those people who like terribly heavy pizza with all of the gooey toppings, your pizza will probably be softer and less enjoyable
For us, who ordered only the basic pie with extra basil, it was delightful
The crust was perfectly crisp yet chewy
That in itself is reason to go back to this place, as is the view overlooking Manhattan only a stone's throw away
Ive been reading some of these reviews
and to all you haters of this pizza
you definitely most be out of towners that eat dominos
or some other nasty fake pizza
this pizza is the real deal
not a typical ny slice
(which I also love
) but this is a brick oven fresh mozzarella
using actual real olives
not some bs from a can
absolutely
absolutely worth the crowd and the wait
the absolute best in nyc and probable the country for brick oven pizza
Don't go there! What they dish you is very far from the taste of the real pizza and is even one of the worst pizza I've ever eaten in NYC
The ingredients are crummy and not so fresh
Honestly I can not understand who loves this place and writes so good reviews!
Definitely worth checking out if you haven't
I like the super-thin crust and charred edges from the coal-fired oven, but sometimes the under-crust feels a touch too thin
If you don't eat it right away, the sauce starts to seep into the crust and you're left with a sloppy slice
Best brick coal brick oven pizza in NYC
We walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and on down to Grimaldi's
makes a great afternoon excursion
The pizza was great, but very different then west coast pizza
Don't expect thick crust like Cali pizza
Great atmosphere, be sure to check out all the pictures on the walls
For years I have trusted citysearch
com reviewers opinions when making decisions on which of the many appealing NYC restaurants I should patronage
After last nights dinner at Grimaldi's I was finally inclined to write my first ever review
Grimaldi's is terrible
a waste of $20 and my time
I should have eaten a cardboard box and saved myself both
For those of you who call this real pizza you have been seriously deprived and I pity you
I've been a number of times, and it's always great
I honestly do not understand how anyone can not love this place, unless they don't like real pizza
Pizza is supposed to have an extremely thin crust, and a sauce which is actually made of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato paste
The crust, fresh mozzarella, crushed tomatoes and fresh basil are all outstanding, and they come together perfectly in the 800 degree coal burning oven
If you only want to eat bread with tomato paste and supermarket cheese, then you may not enjoy it here
But come with an open mind, and you'll learn what real pizza is; a VERY tasty lesson indeed!
We made the trek out to Brooklyn to try Grimaldi's and we weren't disappointed
the pizza is amazing!
The hype surrounding Grimaldi's is about just that, hype
I was willing to stand in line at 10:00 p
m
for an hour to try this pie, which is what I did
I have no complaints about the wait or the service but the pizza was not at all something to write home about
I, with all honesty, have had better pizza at Pizza Hut
I'm from Chicago and we all know that the pizza here is definately worth standing in line for
I can recommend going to Little Italy in New York which is where I found some great pizza
All of the reviews were so promising, but it is the worst of the worst
The pizza is so greasy that the pizza crust sags and drips
The outer crust is burnt, the ingredients are not that fresh and the service is even worse
It is very hard to find a waiter, and getting any refills or help is out of the question
The long line is caused by forcing takeout customers and people waiting for the dining room to stand in the same line
There is one restroom and the line can become as long for the restroom as the line to get in the restaurant
Really not worth the trouble
went with family from italy they loved it~ cooked perfect~ service great~ owner and host frank is a great guy and very nice~ pizza with olives was perfect also desert was very good will go agian very soon
There is no doubt about it - and I have been to them all
This is the best brick oven pizza around
The sauce, the cheese, the toppings - all sure to please

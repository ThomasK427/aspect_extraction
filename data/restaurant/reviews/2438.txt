The hot dogs are pretty nasty
Go to Papaya King on the Upper East Side instead
Equally as cheap, but like 29338 times better
I love this place
Only place to get onions, 'kraut and deli mustard at 4am when you get out of the clubs and starving for something you can afford w/the change left in your pockets
Besides the best which is Pink's Hot Dogs in Los Angeles, Gray's Papaya is good in NY
It's real cheap
they have that deal where you get 2 hotdogs and a drink, i recommend the papaya drink
for only $2
45?? or less
can't really remember
but the hotdogs are SMALL
but good fix for when you're hungry
I never pass up an opportunity to eat at Gray's Papaya
The hot dogs are yummy and their pineapple juice is the best
You definitely get value for your money
HotDogs are good, but not served hot enough, sometimes the middle of the dog is only warm
Juices are ok, taste a little watered down, with too much cream! But you cant beat the price $1
95 for two dogs and a juice compared to Nathans, but at least Nathans is all BEEF
Pick up your food and go
This is a great place for fast, inexpensive food
One of the best bargains New York has to offer
Fast, efficient, tasty
you cannot get a better deal anywhere in the world! For anyone on the go, this is the place to go
Fast and cheap! Maybe not the best dog I ever had, but very close
How can you beat a quick lunch in the city for under $2
Shhhhh! Don't tell anyone I'm posting here, I'm a vegetarian
A bad one, obviously
I confess to have succumbed to the charms of Gray's Papaya
Yes, it's dirty, cramped and crowded, but it's oh-so-cheap, and the hot dogs and drinks are great
Gray's is a good place to get a quick eat
they usually have a $2 dollar special which is 2 dogs and a drink for 2 bucks
The hot dogs are great, the line really moves and the prices are almost ridiculously low
Wolf down a couple dogs (with mustard and kraut), grab your drink and you're outta here in a couple minutes -- and you've only spent a couple bucks
In Short Artful light fixtures, wrought-iron candelabra and votive candles cast a soft glow on striped banquettes and vivid wall murals, giving this sister restaurant to Josie's an upscale feel
The menu features free-range poultry, meats and dairy; and organic produce, all cooked with Asian and Mediterranean accents, and optionally without oil
Dishes include sesame-and-coriander-crusted yellowfin with wasabi coulis, wild mushroom ravioli in a basil-leek broth, organic Black Angus meatloaf and roasted free-range Long Island duck with Israeli couscous
Had a reservation after a very special Graduation day
Got there and was told to wait in line, got up to front and was told I was late and would have to wait 40 min
After explaining to them that I was inline, they said 15 min
I waited over an hour after contantly being told 5 min, table was being set and all kinds of other lies
They should have been up front and admitted that they do not honor reservations
They ruined a very special day and I would definately not recommend this place to anybody!!!
I choose this restaurant because of it's proximity to Linclon Center
I had tickets to the ballet, made reservations that allowed me 1 1/2 hours to dine
After waiting for 45 minutes, I was told that I should order while my table was being prepared
Should I hold the pickles? We sat, and overpriced, bad food was rushed out to us
with the check dropped with the entree's
I guess they needed the table again
Take a little advice, your better off at McDonalds!
making a reservation
You will stay wait 45-60 minutes to be seated
We had to order before sitting down to make our show and bypass first course and dessert
Do yourself a favor and choose another great restaurant by Lincoln Center where you can enjoy the experience of dinner and a show
This restaurant will spoil your night
Was pressed for time as it was sunday morning and needed to find a place for brunch quickly
made a reservation with no problems and we were seated promptly (outdoors)
They have freshly squeezed oj, delicious french toast that comes with fresh fruit and tasty omlettes
Brunch came with a bread basket that has a wonderful assortment of breads and muffins accompanied by a delightful marmalade
service was great too
perfect place to have in your neighborhood
Excellent food--great wine list
Beautiful, airy room
Been going here since '96 and I've always enjoyed it
Taken many friends with diverse tastes and dining habits and everyone is pleased
It is my upper-west side fail safe
The prices are way up there, the food was so-so (I ordered the mango chicken and the quesadillas)
Great to sit outside and people watch, but with so many good restaurants with outdoor seating, why go here?
Went there with a date after a performance at Lincoln Center and had a great time
The food was delicious--try the appetizer of rolled beef slices with green onions in the middle
Along with smiling and attentive waiters, the atmosphere was very pleasant overall (and romantic)
With reasonable prices, this has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants
Sushi quality is high
Sushi bar is fun with lots of local regulars hanging out
Service and ambience is so-so
If you get a group you can get a back room
The restaurant has wonderful window seating, and in general, has a nice ambiance
Unfortunately, this does not make up for the lousy food
The house salad was okay, but the calamari were greasy and rubbery
The Veal Parmigiana was overcooked and full of grizzle
The coffee tasted as if it had been made that morning
(We had dinner)
The bathroom was clean
The seemingly large crowds, strategically seated in the window seats, drove me to try this restaurant
Upon arrival, the dissapointment began
I'd rather not have bread than to be given tasteless, starchy lumps of dough
My friend had the chicken parm; this was so tough and thin that I couldn't readily identify it as chicken
And I tried another chicken dish which was tasteless
Even without the vaste array of area options to eat, I still would never return here
Great atmosphere and Unlimited Champane make Il Violino's champane brunch a bust or the morning after
The service is a little slow, but very friendly
I will keep going back, and definately recommend this afordable choice
Four of us had dinner the other night, and 3 of us were very very pleased
That leads me to recommend avoiding 1) the clams casino and 2) the veal parmigiana
The mozzarella carprese was perfect, and they let you put the oil balsamic on yourself, which is great
The pasta dishes were well cooked and large, and the chicken with wine, garlic shallots over fettucine was EXCELLENT
I always come here, at least once a week
The Gnocchi is the best in the city
Although the service needs some help, they aren't too quick
Probably the best Italian I've had in the city -- by far the best garlic bread in my life

I live in the neighborood and have been a regular customer ever since it opened 4 years ago
As far as I am concerned the place is GREAT! There is simply no other restaurant in the city that offers Cafeteria's mix of high style, delicious food and inexpensive prices (dinner for two wont run more that $50)
After 4 years I STILL find myself eating there 4 times a week! They are definitelly doing something right because they are JAMMED 24/7
My burgers have been good, but each time I've been there the staff's either been rude or inattentive
Maybe if the prices were lower I wouldn't feel so let down
just had one of THE best meals i've had in a while
the food is very simple but well-prepared, well portioned and fresh
the homemade tagliatelle with meat sauce was abs
unbelievable
all around cute, intimate place, but don't expect to lounge around too long after your meal - the place was very packed on a sat
night and we were in and out in under 2 hours
Quiet, rustic atmosphere
Food was great
service was casual but courteous
Overall a very pleasant experience
I will go back soon
As a highly recommended restaurant, I came with high expectations to Piadina
I am very happy to say that they were all met
The service if friendly, the decor is a bit bland, but the lighting romantic
The food is exceptional
Have been here several times and always enjoyed it
Made a reservation for 10 on a busy Saturday night and our group had a fabulous time
The staff was very accomodating, food was great as usual and the wine was flowing
The bill came to $35 a head including gratuity
Nowhere else in NYC can you go out and have that type of meal and atmosphere at that price
This place never dissapoints!
piadina is a such a reliable wonderful dinner place
the atmosphere is so intimate, the service attentive but casual
the food is great and the price is amazing
i recently went there and had incredible buffalo mozzarella
love piadina
I'm truly shocked at some of the negatives reviews of this place! I've been coming back to Piadina for about 4 years now and am still just as pleased with the food as I was the first time I visited
The pasta is always fresh and the bufala mozzarella just MELTS in your mouth - it's one of the best I've ever had
The atmosphere is cozy and romantic and although the waitstaff can get busy and are a little preoccupied at times, I do think they mean well
My only complaint would be that over the past couple years, the quality of the house wines has dropped
Other than that, still a consistent #1 good-eats place in my book
the bland wine paired incredibly well with the absoultely tasteless food
not even the slighest tinge of romance ever even crept into the ambiance here
the acoustics were so awful, it was impossible to speak or hear anything
it felt liek we were in that awful olive garden commerical
enough said
Don't expect any miracles, but the pasta is consistently good and you cannot beat the prices for the fresh quality
Service is often extremely Euro (aka not terribly attentive)
Don't take it personally - relax, have another glass of the mediocre house red and have fun
This is not Il Mulino
I love this place
I take all my first dates there, and it always works out wonderfully
You can't find a more romantic Italian restaurant, in my opinion
Get the magnificent Penne A Pomodoro and a few glasses of red wine, and you'll be in culinary heaven
And, you can smoke in the back! It doesn't get better than that
VERY romantic
Great ambiance
low light, candles, etc
The service stinks
You'll either be ignored for a while, or they'll bring you white wine instead of red, but you straighten it out
You won't even really notice the bumbling waiters, because you'll be too caught up in the perfect romance of your date, and the outstanding cuisine
Love the food, the atmosphere, the prices for the quality
GO!
Piadina reminds me of college food
It's simple, informal and nothing special
It's filled with college kids because it's moderately priced which makes it lively
And as soon as I paid my bill I was asked to leave
That was rude and left an unpleasant impression on me and my friends
I absolutely love Piadia
The pasta is homeade
the cheese melts in your mouth
I'm surprised that people have given the food such a low number
It's a great date restaurant and the waiters are hot, but sometime a little slow
A great place for good quality, real northern italian food - not the artificial, oversized red-sauced gloop that passes for Italian to some New Yorkers
Went here for the first time on a date
was a great, intimate dining experience
low light, italian servers, rustic feel
food was good
excellent tiramisu
Not too expensive, but nothing to write home about
Food was mediocre: average, uninteresting pastas, and a veal chop : that was extremely fatty
The service is authentic italian: slow and totally disinterested
Also, they don;t take credit card! It's cash only, whcih is very inconvenient when you are paying for a group of 12 people
I'm not sure how a restauraunt in manhattan can afford to lose the credit card business- an attempt at hiding their income, maybe? The wine list is good, and overall it is not too expensive, though, and the atmosphere is very dark and brick-covered, much like any damp basement
this place is what ny is all about so get in there and eat up
I went to Piadina with a group of 6 friends which quickly grew to 8 friends the staff was very accomodating and friendly
The food was fresh but just sortta blah -nothing really stood out, since we had such a large group we had a good portion of the fairly limited menu and there was nothing that was BAD per se but Nothing that was very memorable either,all in all I would recommend it for a quick bite,but no need to go out of your way
Went to this place about 3 years ago with some friends and I remember the service, price, and food being pretty solid (I should also include the fact that we were all hammered from happy hour at Ipanema across the street, but I digress)
Went there on Cinco de Mayo for lunch with 8 others and (to make a long story short), ONLY 4 OUT OF 8 GOT THEIR FOOD! Must have been a bad day for the kitchen staff
At one point someone realized that no one in the restaurant (which was pretty full) had food on their table
Not good times
Fortunately I was one of the 4 who got served so I can say that the fahita's are awesome and the sangria is good
But if you catch 'em on one of those days, just save your time and walk out
I've been here many times with several different groups of friends
The food is great, they keep the chips/salsa coming, and the drinks are potent and oh-so-yummy! I'd definitely recommend this place to kick back with friends and enjoy a good Mexican meal
I'd avoid the nights when there's the band because you really can't hear yourself talk, but it does make for a lively night for sure!
I went to Tequila's on a Friday night with 20 of my friends
We made reservations for 9:00, but didn't get seated until 9:45
The service was pretty bad overall, the seating was a little awkward, and the food was horrible
Oh! and the sangria was a joke--- probably the worst I've ever had
I would recommend the margaritas though
The live band was fun, but there wasn't much of a dance floor
I don't know if I would go back here necessarily
This deliciious mexican resturant has an excellent wait staff, polite and prompt, and delicious burritos and enchilladas! Its a great place for small families, good friends, and romantic couples! Don't get full on the tasty chips and salsa that come on the house!!
What were they thinking? What Mexican restaurants have the other reviewers been to

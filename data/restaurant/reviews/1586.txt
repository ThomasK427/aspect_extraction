but I guess that's how they keep the prices down
They give you a lot of quality food for the price
The bar and garden areas are also pleasant, and there's outdoor seating in nice weather
I recommend it to all of my out-of-town friends visiting NY
The decor is wonderful
just like being indoors somewhere in Italy
BUT the food was absolutely horrible! I went out with 3 of my friends and all our dishes tasted bland, old, salad tasted wilted and unwashed
pasta wasn't cooked (hard)
We were really disappointed!!! When we complained one waiter was rude the others shuffled about and ignored us
My friends decided to just pay and get the hell out of there!
the atomosphere wasn't bad
the price was good
but the food was not so impressive
not bad, just, there weren't so much reasons that i want to go back there
e
g, fish dishes were sort of flat
maybe i am too picky
the service was OK, but not great
but, again, for the price, ok
Cucina di Pesce has great food, nice atmosphere, and a great location! You can't beat that for the price, which is extremely resonable!
This is my favorite restaurant in Manhattan
I have had nothing but great times there and I try to get there for every major occasion
The menu is so cheap and the food is so tasty
Whether I am going out on a date, with my daughter, or for business, the restaurant lives up to its reputation of the best kept secret of the East Village
Attentive staff, great food, and a wonderful selection of international music make it very hard to find a match in the area and beyond
Try it and you will go back again
Last night I went there with two of my female friends
Upon arrival the one of the wait staff began making inappropriate comments to me and my friends
Our waiter spoke a million miles an hour and with an indescribable accent, it became a form of unrecognizable English
His pushy approach and tireless filling to the brim wine glass refilling became annoying
This was all compounded by the noise level in the restaurant which hit such a pitch, it was just easier to sit in silence then try to have a conversation over it
Yes, it was a relatively cheap dinner, but also since the food was just mediocre, my friends and I won't be going back
This is a great find for inexpensive Italian food
Though Cucina di Pesce has a cozy decor, its abundance in patrons creates a noise level that is not for those who seek a quiet romantic evening
It is a lively place with delicious food and plentiful portions
The service is attentive and charming
The seafood linguini is good even though the pasta was a little too al dente for my taste
My favorite pick would be the pumpkin ravioli
I would recommend making reservations, because it does get crowded
GREAT RESTAURANT AND A STANDBY FAVOURITE
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT THEY ONLY TAKE CASH! BUT THE SEAFOOD LINGUINE IS GREAT FOR THE MONEY AND THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS ATTENTIVE AND CHARMING
This place is in a neighborhood where you wouldn't expect such coziness, but it certainly delivers it
The price is right, the service is excellent and the food is delicious
A great place for a first date - a touch of romance but nothing that will scare them off!
One of my favorite resturants
Food is cheap and really good
Amtosphere is cozy
This is one of my favourite restaurants in NYC! It is not the 'fanciest' place but it is certainly comfortable and the food is excellent
I have never introduced anyone to the place who was not a convert immediately
The food is delicious, I've had most of the menu items by now
The service is friendly and attentive without being pushy
The atmosphere is great, always a buzz about the place
It can get a little noisy so don't go at the weekends looking for a quiet place to chat!
My girlfriend and i went here last week and we really liked it
We both ordered fish and although it wasn't the best we have had, it wasn't bad
The service made up for what the food lacked though
We are looking forward to returning to try the pasta dishes
Great value and nice space
I love this place
The service is great
The atmosphere is great, especially in the back room
The FOOD IS GREAT! And you CAN'T BEAT the PRICES!!!!! When I want to take a friend or a date to a place that will make then smile and feel relaxed but not make them spend too much on the date I go here
I also have large birthdays and dinners here with friends so everyone eats well and spends little! And wait
They have a small SMOKING SECTION
A lost art in NYC!!!!
In Short This Mexican joint's three red-roomed locations keep their kitchens cooking from lunch until the witching hours, churning out a homemade menu for Eastsiders on the go and tipsy revelers looking to nosh late-night
Staples are available every which way--tacos hard and soft, wrapped in tortillas stuffed with guacamole, cheese or black beans; burritos of beef, breaded catfish, pork pipian and chipotle chicken; plus a choice of four sauces from mild to just plain "stupid
"
So I went to San Loco yesterday for a quick cheap dinner to find that they have redecorated
To my dismay I found that they are paying for the redecorations by upping their prices
It seems everything went up by about $1
50
The good side is they now offer beer, but I'd rather bring cheap tacos with me to a bar than pay the prices they charge now
Very disappointed
Before going out, after going out, sitting on the couch, or taking it to go, San Loco is fantastic, quick Mexican food
Nothing beats a chipotle chicken queso loco
I'll take 2, with a side of serious sauce
I've eaten here fairly consistently since the late 80's
It has remained relatively unchanged since - great tasting and inexpensive and open really late
I wish they still had beer though
MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE BEEN DEVOUT FANS OF THIS PLACE FOR THE LAST 7 YEARS
IN THE OLD DAYS YOU COULD GET YOURSELF SOME GREAT FOOD AND EVEN BEER ARE VERY RESONABLE PRICES
OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS SOMETHING HAS CHANGED
THE FOOD HAS BECOME INEDIBLE , THE DELIVERY HAS BECOME AWFULLY SLOW AND THE PRICES HAVE GONE HIGH
MY ADVICE!!
STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THE FOOD UNTIL THEY GET BACK TO THE OLD DAYS!!
It's simple, it's cheap, and it's oh so good
Definitely the best canned cheese in the city
That may not sound like much, but San Loco is better than Mexican restaurants that cost 5 times as much
The nachos blow away any Heartland / TGIF concoctions
Five bucks will get you fed right
I had a party of seven and the restaurant called us 2x to make sure that we were going to show up on time (or risk losing our reservation)
When we got there, it wasn't even full! Having read reviews to come for the arepas, most of us ordered 2-3 arepas each
The waiter then came back and said that we were required to order drinks since it was dinnertime
Seems to me like most restaurants shouldn't require their customers to do anything (especially since we were a large party at an empty restaurant)
Arepas were subpar - they were too dry and chewy
I recommend Caracas Arepa Bar (also in the East Village) for better fried arepa goodness
Left disappointed, and a little embarrassed that I had chose this restaurant for a group dinner
*This review was written a year after my visit so maybe things are different now
Come for the arepas, stay for the arepas: they're stuffed to overflowing with tender, juicy, long-marinated meats (or beans, queso blanco, scrambled eggs), and one of the best food values this city has to offer

The lunch that my girlfriend and I had was classic diner fare
Nothing fancy
Either waffles or pancakes were cooking and they smelled great
The burger was actually on the small side, so I don't know what an earlier reviewer was thinking
Regardless, Pete's Place is a fine place if you are looking for diner food at reasonable prices
The old woodwork, mirrors, and antique chandeliers and the extensive range of delicious (and cheap) food make it a find for the neighborhood
The place is an unusual combination all the good things about a diner, upscale restaurant, icecream parlour, and saloon
The service is caring and quirky!
burgers are relly great and big, so are breakfast there and coffee in the morning
too bad I live twenty blocks away
In Short Rolf's is one of the city's most festive German eateries, particularly during the holiday season, when the dining room is decorated to the nines
Surrounded by stained glass windows and black-and-white portraits, regulars indulge in upscale German comfort food like crispy potato pancakes with applesauce, wiener schnitzel and grilled sausages with sauerkraut, accompanied by a long list of imported beers
I had a reservation, made by talking with someone AT THE RESTAURANT and they did not have it registered when we arrived
Because it was getting late, we decided to wait
It looked festive and fun, we even found seats at the bar
That was the last good experience there
We proceeded to wait for about 2 hours - while chatting with people nearby who boasted that they walked right in without reservations and were seated in 30 minutes
After the longest wait I've ever had, we finally sat down and THEN waited even longer for our dinner while watching other people get seated after us and receive their meals
By that point, I was too furious to eat
I spoke with the manager, who showed no concern, and left
Clearly, I will never return
No atmosphere or food can make up for being treated that poorly
Never have I been treated so poorly as I had by this establishment
After making a reservation for 8 people for 3PM on the Sunday before Christmas for a holiday meal over one month ago, Rolf's decided to cancel my reservation not the the week before, or even a day before, but an hour and a half before our booked time
Adding insult to injury, Rolf's made no offer of an alternative date or time, but simply said 'we can't fit you in'
All in all, not very good business sense
I live and work in Manhattan, and I can honestly say this was the absolute worst experience I have every had in the food services arena, and my friends and I eat out quite often in this great city
Rolf's is absolutely overated!
Rolf's is a wonderful spot for getting yourself into the Christmas spirit, it's like you're sitting in the middle of a Christmas tree! The positives: I highly recommend the beer list and bar
The negatives: The service is awful, I forgot a personal item on the table
after overhearing a conversation, I realized the waiter actually gave it to another female member of the staff
when I asked if he had seen the item
he lied! Not so much in the Christmas spirit if you ask me and overall pretty sad!
I have dined at Rolf's for years and after my last visit cannot return again
Even with reservations, checking in, and a generally quiet night, the hostess forgot that we were there and gave our table to her friends
Twice
We waited over 50 minutes
The barman was totally snotty, and would not condescend to make recommendations from their touted beer list
The food, when it arrived, was poorly presented and down right awful
It's a pity, at these prices
While this room is still pretty, its just not worth the aggravation a meal at Rolf's has become
This place is an incredible mix of German American festive holiday environment and generously tasty comfort food feast! Much laughter can usually be heard eminating from Rolf's from a block away! Great for in and out-of-towners!
The Christmas decorations are outstanding, but they believe that the long lines to get a table mean that they can charge whatever they like
$50-60 per person for, let face it, diner food at best is getting a little crazy
Have drink at the bar and go elsewhere for food
I suggest you to go here with your date during the christmas season for their beautiful decoration but if your date can't tolerate bad food, don't take him/her there
It's truly a wonderland inside until you taste their food
Their food is very verrrryyyy dry and bland
I can honestly say my bf who is a horrible cook can cook better than their chef
I think they are overpriced for the food and neighborhood too
The only place I have found in New York with wonderful German food
The wienerschnitzel is out of this world as are the potato pancakes
Just a great place!
Rolf's was a major disappointment
The waitress was incorrect in quoting what was served with the meals and the entrees were certainly below par
We ordered the potato cakes as an appetizer and there were delicious, but our good fortune ended there
The spaetzle was very dry and overcooked and the yaeger snitzel was gross
The food is definitely not worth the cash you spend on it
The lite beer was redeeming, however! I don't have any better places to offer in NYC, but avoid this one if you can!
We got here by accident -- were looking for another restaurant and saw Ralf's
It is so beautiful inside
Like a fairy tale
(Too bad it's all plastic
)  First we sat at the bar
Drinks were nice
We had a comfortable feeling there
Then, we were seated at the booth
The seats were a bit of uncomfortable, but ok
Menu is interesting
Looked like authentic german cousine
A lot of pork (which they simply call pig)
Food was nice, not perfect
Maybe 4 out of 5
Staff ranged from ok to friendly
We all really liked this place
Atmosphere and decor are very appealing
Place is somewhat pricey (entree is ~$23), so won't be able to go here often, but will come back
Place is somewhat small, so makes sense making reservations
With charming authentic decor and delicious German-American food to boot, this restaurant is a must for everyone
I highly recommend it to all!
I went to see the Christmas decorations, but they did not make up for the horrible food
They have the worst potato pancakes that I have ever tasted; they are basically fried dough with way too much flour and not much potato
I know that this isn't a seafood place, but still the scallops were very bitter and the sauce was flavorless
My husband's pork was also nasty, and did not taste or smell fresh
It's extremely expensive for what you get; if you want much better german food and fresher beer for better prices, try Heidelberg
the mountains of meat and potatoes could not be brought by a friendlier staff
leave new york city and enter the enchanted forest
where the strudel comes with more smiles than you have seen in years
thanks rolf's family, we will be back again and again
If they would have put as much care into the food as they did for the christmas decoration, this place would be great
The vegetables were out of a can
The Knoedel (Potatoe Dumpling) was so hard, i had to use a knife to cut thru
We paid to much for some sort of Kantinenessen
Enjoy the atmopshere and have an overpriced german beer, but don't eat there
Great decor, fodd was pretty good, but for the money, ehhh I don't know, have to go back there again to really make a determination
I picked out this restaurant to have my birthday dinner and it was great! Ambiance was great - warm and cozy - didn't feel like we were in NYC
Food was excellent
I had the wurst and pork chop platter
Best pork chop I've had in ages - lean, thick, smokey, not dry
Wurst and Saurkraut were excellent

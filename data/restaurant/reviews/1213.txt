The maitre d', also at the end sent us a bottle of Moscato since it was my wife and I anniversary
Around midnight, we made our way to the hidden treasure at ora
the private lounge where we orderd shisha and chose from a variety of flavored tobaccos
The lounge started to get really crowded so we decide to call it a night and we left
Overall, I had a great experience at Ora
I WIll BE BACK
What was supposed to be a nice New York night out was just awful, mainly because the food was horrendous! I had the monkfish entree that tasted like rubber cloaked in sauces
The waitstaff, though courteous were simply unskilled
Our waiter first broke the cork of our 2nd bottle of red wine, then opened another only for us to find that it was chilled (no it wasn't a rosee either)
It was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life
We had a 12:45 reservation for 7 people
Our party grew to 14, but the restaurant was almost empty about 8 other people were there
The service was horrendous
The waiter was sullen and lackadaisical
We sat there for 25 minutes before he even took our orders
Even then, he neglected to offer us drinks
After he took our order, another 45 minutes passed before we were told that they couldnt make one of the appetizers
After a 90 minute we finally got our food
The few that ordered the salmon or steak were happy; but the salads were disgusting And when more salad dressing was requested, we received warm olive oil instead
After a 21/2 hour lunch in which our displeasure was apparent, we didn't receive an apology or an explanation from the waiter or manager
I went Saturday with a group of 10
We had a 9:00 PM reservation and half the menu items were sold out or we were told had only one portion left
Everyone scambled to find something to order we waited
and waited
finally we got water after a half hour we asked for bread and were told that was out as well
I noticed they gave the table next to us a plate so I asked a waitress that wasn't ours and she brought us bread
The food was terrible, the chicken was either pink or rubbery and over cooked, the fish was not prepared as they said it would be, and the steak looked like something I would give my dog
The waiter stood about 2 feet from us and was cursing us out to his manager, he was highly unprofessional
I wouldn't eat here again if the meal was free
I was at Ora last weekend with a group of friends and we had the best time! After our great dinner we continue the party in the downstairs lounge where my friends and I chilled out, enjoyed cool cocktails and smoked hookahs all night
I highly recommend Ora and will definitely be back
Fantastic Menu and sushi to die for! Their shumai melts in your mouth
It's delicious! The sushi is excellent try their spicy tuna roll, camelot and snow white
Service is very good
There is no ambience but if you want great sushi this is the place for you
It's terribly packed so you don't need reservations you can just walk right in
This is a hidden gem, a sleeper! I live 6 blocks away and just discovered it last week
This is my new spot and I can't wait to have it delivered
I've walked by the place so many times and finally made my way into getting a table for myself and my girlfriend
We felt immediately welcome as the service was great and the decor set a romantic mood
The food was presented elegantly, and devoured rapidly
I now kick myself for not having tried Pacific Echo sooner
I suggest the tuna pizza as the appetizer to start with; accompany it with the Kiwi Martini
You're on your own from there
The Thai Curry soup is a must-have
I had it a few months ago, have been craving it ever since, just had it again tonight, and it was just as good as I remember it
Subtlely flavored with spices, the texture was just right to pack a delightful punch
The rolls are also very innovative - the combinations work
The Tom Yum Shrimp was very reminiscent of Tom Yum soup, for fans of that soup
The waiters are SUPER nice and attentive
Ambience is modern, but relaxing
Bathroom (one of the impt indicators of a worthy restaurant) is clean, modern, and interesting
All in all, a delightful experience
I'm a local and will definitely come back again to try something else!
I visted Pacific Echo with couple of me workers
I was expecting the normal Chinese-Japanese cuisine, instead we got out of this world awsome French-Asian dishes that are just so delicious
Either the Grand Marnier Shrimp, Tuna Pizza, or the Bonito Crusted Salmon and Scallops, and who ever thought of goat cheese inside a tuna roll
All of the dishes are work of art, and the servers are friendly and helpful we definetly going back
The whole experience left me in tears
The waiter brought out a roll I only asked about, but didn't order
I waited until the end of the meal to say anything (I hate confrontation)
He argued with me that I ordered it
And I didn't even eat the roll! I spoke to the manager when the roll wasn't taken off the bill
I didn't even have a chance to explain the situation before I was being yelled at by the manager because I didn't mention the error right away
He kept trying to make me understand
The manager was irate and said since I was not coming back to the restaurant anyway why show good service
The sushi was okay at the best, but the service was beyond terrible
I have NEVER been treated so horribly by a manager
CONSUMER BEWARE! Pacific Echo does not know how to treat customers
This place has great service and really good food
you deffinately cannot go wrong here, no matter what the occasion
In fact when I was there, a couple was planning to have their wedding reception in this restaurant - what a great idea!! They have a great coctail menu - the Lychee Martini is a must!
We went to eat after the show, at 11:00 at night
On our waiter's suggestion, we chose to be surprised with his choice of dishes
One surprise after another, in a stream of WOW dishes
I think the chef purposely dazzled us because we were such an appreciative audience and it was so late at night
Well, including my feet, I don't have enough thumbs to tell you how spectacular it was
P
S
Litchi martini and Mango Mohito set the tone
I was walking by and the lunch special caught my eye
A froi gras salad
A very pleasant surprise to find such an amazing dish as well as first class sushi!!! I highly recommend everything about this restaurant
We had the $30 prix fixe menu and there was a variety of food options ranging from raw fish to meat dishes
The deal also comes with a complimentary bottle of wine
We had rolls, which were pretty ubiquitous-spicy tuna and eel avocado
However, the taste was not
The rolls were delicious
They were one of the best rolls that I have ever had
The spices and the fish blended together beautifully
The sushi pieces were delicious
We also had an extra appetizer-some sort of fish roll, which was dipped in spicy sauce
If we could, we would have drank the sauce
The beef dishes are delicious too
Great deal with great food!
The first time we went there, we sat upstairs
The chic decor and romantic atmosphere was perfect for our anniversary dinner
We had the Pan Seared Salmon with Shaved Bonito Crusted Scallops and Trio Style Angus Beef
The food and dish presentation were AMAZING! We were so impressed, we went back with a huge group of coworkers for happy hour
This time, we were on the first floor where they easily accommodated us with attentive service again

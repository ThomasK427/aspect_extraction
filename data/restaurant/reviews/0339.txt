My friend ordered the scallops which were served in a light red sauce that was complemented very nicely with atichoke palms
Very nice meal which was prepared exactly to our expectations
However, the best part of the meal came in the form of service
Troy, our waiter, was prompt - friendly and extremely professional
Because of the service and quality of food I will be returning again and again
The Scene Abundant red neon signage and plenty of vertically suspended salamis compete for visual attention at Tal Bagel, a popular Upper East Side spot that serves some of the best bagels in the city
The restaurant is frequently a circus of activity on weekend mornings and is especially popular with families
An eager team of Bangladeshis fills orders behind the counter
The Food Bagels from Tal have a great chewy texture, with an overall mass somewhere between those from H
Good bagels and good cream cheese
None of that yucky whipped stuff
But they don't have a toaster, which is strange
Want to start your day with a great bagel
Try Tal Bagel located on 86th street on the East side
On return from a long night out I stopped by
They have great bagel specially in the morning since they are right out of the oven
The bagels here are perfect soft and tender on the inside an slightly crusty on the outside great for sandwiches
There chicken soup actually has chicken in it and the tuna is mouth-watering
These place is not fancy but with one the most organized, excellent and friendly service with is quick to go
The staff seems highly organized and fast worker with reasonable prices
Surprise to find out they do not make eggs and don't toast bagel I guess cause they are always serving fresh
Great bagel place
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound)
Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
Never fails to please
delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey
Service is fast and friendly
Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel
But that is highly forgivable
Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price
Other apetizers and food
Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel! They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!! A little crowded but they move that line really fast! A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
good bagels, lousy service good priced nova--icky iced coffee
but they deliver
Great bagels, which make the best sandwiches
Their bagels are by far the best of any I've ever had and I've lived in NY for 24 years
Tal wins hands-down for the best bagels in town!The bagels always taste perfect!crisp on the outside and doughy-to-die-for on the inside!yum!

All of them have either patronized the long steaming troths of food behind this bustling food counter or have been honored with an autographed picture on the wall
The brightly lit Bed-Sty soul food joint, which does big business at their attached bar, serves heaping plates southern grandma food: grilled honey mustard chicken, collard greens, cornbread, candied yams and countless others
I MOVED TO BROOKLYN FROM THE SOUTH,AND WAS INITIALLY GLAD TO SEE A RESTAURANT NEARBY THAT SERVED,OR SO THEY SAY,SOUTHERN SOUL FOOD
I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE FOOD
THIS PLACE PUTS A SCOOP OF MASHED UP CANDIED YAMS INTO A PREBAKED SINGLE SERVING PIE CRUST AND CALLS IT SWEET POTATO PIE, SERVES POTATO SALAD WITH GREEN PEPPERS AND NO SEASONONG WHATSOEVER AND PROUDLY PROCLAIMS IT SOUTHERN! THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN,THE CRABCAKES ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE
TAKE IT FROM A SISTA FROM THE SOUTH,AND ASK ANY OTHER TRUE SOUTHERNER ABOUT THIS FOOD
THEY WILL ALL SAY THE SAME THING
I DON'T THINK SO!!!!! FROM WHAT I'VE TASTED HERE,I'M SORRY NATIVE NEW YORKERS,BUT TO GET A TASTE OF THE REAL THING,YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE A RIDE DOWN 95
Soul food is supposed to be heavily seasoned and have lots of flavor
THIS place missed the boat on BOTH those accounts
We tried twice (first attempt, sandy spinach, fried shrimp so curried that they were brown on the flesh - second attempt, roasted chicken that seemed microwaved, crabcake that was rubbery and mostly bread, horribly tasteless mac and cheese) and both times were absolutely disappointed
The sweet tea is the only redeeming factor and man cannot live on it alone
This intimate, cozy, space draws a pretty cool crowd
Without question, it's our Clinton Hill haunt
Good live music, and occasional art show
Great place to just grab a beer and gab with friends, or have a lazy dinner
Fantastic mac cheese
My one warning, watch out for the martinis
They're yummy, and huge
but *whump*
the tag ain't pretty
Boy: where to start? First of all, the 5 spot isn't in Bed-Stuy but Clinton Hill
Small difference, yes, but it really ought to be included in a Fort Greene/Clinton Hill Search
Secondly, it seems like Malik has almost given up on being this being restaurant and has finally realized that the way to make money with the place is to turn it into a night spot
'Bout time
This neighborhood doesn't really have anything where you can go for a pint to watch the game and maybe catch a dj set
Now it does
The service leaves plenty to be desired, but the place attracts a diverse local clientele for drinks and snacks
They get good djs, they've got a great selection of beers
Some of the drink menu is pricey, but there are enough bargains to appeal to the mizer in anybody
Just stay away from the food
The Five Spot Soul Sundays is where it's at with its innovative entertainment
With a live fusion of Art, Hip-Hop, and comedy it seems impossible for one not to have an extremely memorable night
Live artists take the stage as they have one hour to create a masterpiece, while Dj's, breakdancers, and M

For anyone who enjoys art and urban music, this is the perfect environment
Not to mention the food, booze, and mood is just right

The FoodThe flavors of Ethiopian cuisine have no counterpart in American cooking: If you like spongy buckwheat pancakes, you'll flip for injera, the ubiquitous bread used to grab bites
Almost everything else is stewed in or spiked with berbere, a peppery, brick-colored paste
Timatim fitfit, a bread salad with tomatoes, is a fresh-tasting appetizer
Doro tips (chicken marinated and fried in spices) and tibs wot (berbere stewed beef) make for savory and tender entrees
Vegetarian dishes have one constant: mashed, spiced, room-temperature beans
Skip the Americanized desserts, but do wash down dinner with a malty Ethiopian beer
As a native Ethiopian, I think this is one of the best Ethiopian restaurants in NYC
I definitely recommend it
You have to be comfortable eating with your hands, sharing the same plate with your friends and be able to handle spicy food (not as spicy as some thai dishes though)
Vegetarian dishes are always good, but if you're a meat eater try the Tibs
The waitresses can advise you too
I actually though this was a pretty enjoyable restaurant - not the best Ethiopian I've ever had, but very far from the worst
But really I wanted to leave a review because I feel the need to comment on an earlier one: it's one thing to complain about bad service, etc, but if you've never had Ethiopian before, make sure you know what your talking about before you complain about the food
Your entire order is SUPPOSED to come on one plate, it's not supposed to have flatware, and it is supposed to be eaten by using the pancake as a scoop

The food did anything but change my life
Pass it up, little dogies
love the catfish and chicken fried steak
every other time the pork chops go from juicy and tender to dried out shoe leather
always had great service even at noisy overcrowded peak times
sorry some people have not (including friends)
hope the good staff doesn't get penalized for the bad few
[management take note of the many complaints]MISS THE LOW PRICED BUFFET!!!!! don't forget to have a drink in the god awful lounge i can't stay away from! can get very busy and loud
This is a real as it gets - far and away the BEST southwestern fare in town
The menu is an exact replica of its sister location in New Mexico - right down to the Frito Pie (don't knock it till you've tried) and a killer array of margaritas
Even the guys were drinking the peach concoction (in a jar!) and the crowd went from trendy to outright rockabilly
Get the ice cream 'baked potato' for dessert, you'll feel like 6 years old again
Kick butt drinks and Perfectly tasty chicken fried steak topped many a night at Cowgirl for me
You'll love it!
I had two really nice meals here
But then, one of my friends who had come to dinner with me and my family straight from work lost one of the shoes that was in her bag that night
When she went back to the restaurant to check if she had left it there, the hostess, the bartender, and the wait staff was extremely rude and condescending, and laughed hysterically after asking my friend how drunk she must have been to lose a shoe
She went in the middle of the afternoon, not during a rush
After such treatment, I would never go here again
Being from Texas I can say the food is great
However, the service lacks
Very sloooooooooooow
it was good food, plenty of it
but i didn't feel like the breakfast the my boyfriend and i ate was necessarily worth the price we paid
but the service was REALLY good, and the food was very good too
This place does everything right
Quiet, romantic dining room w/ fireplace and piano music
Service is very good, not in a hurry to push you out the door
Good Italian food at reasonable prices
In Short Two Boots proffers one of the more unusual culinary hybrids around, joining flavors of Italian and Louisianan descent (two boot-like landmasses--get it?)
You can order po' boys and other Cajun dishes, but as at all the Two Boots to-go outposts, the thin-crust pizza is the main attraction
Look for memorably named pies like the Larry Tate (white pizza with spinach, garlic and tomatoes) and the Earth Mother (a vegetable-only homage to Bette Midler)
Awesome thin, crunchy-chewy crust splattered with cornmeal--but stick with the white (sauceless) pies, as the tomato sauce used here has a really strong, medicinal taste from too much sage and oregano
It's also almost brown in color, too thick and pasty
In Short This Burritoville location does brisk take-away business with oversized, overstuffed burritos filled with vegetables, salsa and meats like jerk chicken and vegetarian chorizo
Neighborhood regulars are just as apt to sit in the tiny, brightly colored dining room when diving into full meals, including soups and salads and Mexican-inspired desserts
The rodeo chicken burrito
A tacky name that by no means measures up to the delcious burrito I inhaled from burritoville last week
Saturated in thick, tangy bbq sauce, the shredded chicken was tender and soft, tangled deliciously with swirls of spinach and bursting with the garlicky smoked taste of simmered black beans and bay leaves
The burrito was massive, the sweet brown rice and rich bbq sauce ran out onto my hands from the overlapping spaces between the tortilla edges
I cannot wait to order again soon from this place
My coworkers and I went here for lunch today, and I ordered a chicken burrito
After two of us had our orders, the other two waited around for at least 20 minutes before we finally walked up and asked where our food was
The gal behind the counter shrugged and said, it's here
It had just been sitting there, even though our party was very obviously still waiting! Then when we got back to work and I started eating, I realized there was no chicken in my (supposed) chicken burrito
I got halfway through and finally found a little chunk of chicken, along with a big hunk of chicken fat
Gross
So my entire burrito had one piece of chicken and one piece of fat
And to think, I could have just gone directly downstairs from work and gotten a delicious burrito from Chipotle! I know better for next time
In Short What used to be a garage in the '20s is now a casual American restaurant famous for its live free jazz and late night meals
Out-of-towners and locals alike dive into the a la carte dinners and weekend prix fixes while watching the show
In summer, the outdoor cafe is a airy spot for microbrewed beers, raw bar selections, and chargrilled burgers and fries; in winter; tables around the stone fireplace warm crowds
Had the mussels and steak frittes there both of which are really fantastic
The wasabi mayo is a nice twist on an original
The decor is nice with dark-paneled wood and a live jazz band playing
Overall, a place I highly recommend
WOW!!! what an amazing time we had,,, we were 2 couples out celebrating our 2nd wedding aniversaries,,,,it was suggested by friedns that we go to Garage,,,,and they said we would like it

WE LOVED IT!!!! the place was beautiful

Went Thursday night
This is NOT the place to eat
Rarely have I had such bad food in an NYC restaurant
The bar drinks were good (strong), and the jazz was different, but the food was horrible
I was going to get steak frites, but the waiter we had recommended lobster ravioli
I figured he must have tried a few things on the menu, so I went with that rec
It was enough to make me not want to eat seafood for a loooong time
It tasted like rubber
Horrible
The stuffed chicken my date had tasted alright
The presentation of the food was cute, but it's not all about presentation
Don't waste your money here
Took my fiance's jazz loving stepfather here for some music and a new york strip steak
It was his first time in NYC and I wanted to have him leave with a great impression
Garage fit the bill! It was amazing! The food was delicious, the music was great, the portions left us full where we couldnt fit dessert
The staff was friendly and attentive
The atmosphere is purely romantic with dim lighting and candlelight dinner
He still raves about it today!
The food is magnificent, even during restaurant week
We checked out coats and were seated immediately
Our waiter was extremely knowledgable about the specials and service was prompt
We were not rushed through dinner
Great dining experience overall
The overall dining experience was very nice

This is probably one of the unsung heros in Manhattan steakhouses
A butcher shop right on the premises gives you the authenticity - but the food gives you the proof
If you're not up for steaks - go for the mussels and pomme frites, wash it down with some beers
Its a bit cramped, and a bit dark, and a bit of a wait - but get over it and enjoy yourself
I went to Les Halles for brunch, and it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time! The service was excellent - attentive, but not overly so
They were more than happy to seat us even though we were early for our reservation
Our orders came out quickly, and the food was great
Best chocolate mousse I've ever had
I plan to go back soon
The raw display of meat struck me, first and foremost, as I entered this place
Then, I was ushered into the dark and slightly dingy atmosphere inside
onto a table where I could barely see my steak
Nonetheless, the meal was a juicy and tasty experience
With a good glass of Cote de Rhone, lunch here is just plain sinfully delightful
I would recommend the steak frites
Especially the frites
I also got a taste of the boudin, which was really to die for
Not for the faint of heart
The food is consistently good, but the snooty attitude of the waitstaff bring the place down
The restaurant is always packed solid, not making it the quietest place to share a meal, and it completely baffles me why they feel the need to add to the noise by playing loud music
We loved all the steaks we tried at our table, but evenmore impressive was the dessert
I especially liked the apple tart - delicious!!
This should be the number one restaurants for fries
Recommend the steak and frites and a good glass of red!
This was a regular haunt for a large group of us - but after Friday night's dinner I would never go back
The waiter was incredibly rude and arrogant
Having upset one of my party we complained to the manager up front
Les Halles couldn't have cared less
They are resting on their laurels, but today you'll find standards have dropped and the food as bad value as ever
I would not recommend this place any more
What a terrible shame!
If you like having to pull your table out to go to the bathroom every time
If you like waiters to ignore you, bring your wine, appetizers and drinks in an untimely manner
If you like waiters to make you feel like you are not worth serving, then this restaurant is for you
food was better than good, however was crammed into our seats
for my girlfriend to go to the ladies room was a huge event we had to move like 3 tables to get her out
waiters were hard to track down and i felt very rushed
based solely on food, i liked it
everything else made it a trying experience
I've been here twice and the first time was pleasant, but the second time the meal was rushed, the service seemed non-existent (we had to keep waving down the water just to get some water), and their air conditioning seems non-existent (and when it's 100 degrees outside it's quite unpleasant)
Food is ok, don't expect much
I read the book and it was great, and then went to eat
First don't be a tourist and go on a weekend
Second, it's a real bistro, loud, dark, and busy
A great atmosphere
The steave au poivre is super! And at $19 it's a great dish
Don't waste your money on the other steaks, we made the mistake of getting the special - tbone, and it was a waste of $32
We'll definitely go back for the steak au poivre
Also our waiter really pushed expensive wine on us
We wanted a bottle around $30 and they had lots of choices, but he said they all are horrible, and you need to pay at least $50
His comment was rude and unappreciated
But otherwise a great little place
Reminiscent of a Parisian steakhouse, this is one of my favorite spots for a well-prepared, hefty meal
The steaks are of high quality, and they know how to make french fries
I, along with everyone else in NY, read THE BOOK
so I had to try the food
Anthony Bourdain was actually present
walking around the restaurant and chattin' it up with the customers
Anyway, I came in with high (and probably unreasonable) expectations
Had the NY Sirloin
good, but great
It was like $25
for about $18, it would have been a good dish
For $25, I can get a real steak at a real steakhouse
Guess I should go for more bistro-type food next time (like confit de canard or something)
Will still go back
I like the busy, loud, and lively setting
I feel so fortunate to have the Tibetan Kitchen in my neighborhood
I have always loved it from the first time I went there
I can only surmise that the people who have complained about the food / service in the other reviews do not really understand Tibetan food or Tibetan culture
The renovation is impeccable and the decorative painting is phenomenal
It only made a successful restaurant even better
The Dalai Lama oversees all from a small but focal shrine in the wall
I am particularly fond of the Tibetan stews
So simple, clean and pure
Not at all what someone who ordered a stew might expect
Open you mind and your taste buds
We have all been overstimulated and this is just the place to go to return to the basics of taste
I don't understand people who say food is disgusting because it's blend
Tibetan food is supposed to be that way! That's the beauty of it
If your taste buds are used to General Tso's Chicken and Samosas this is not the place for you
I live near by this place and stopped by several times
I have to admit at first when I tried their momo dumplings (thinking that I'd get something like Shanghainese juicy dumplings) I was very dissapointed
But then again, tibetan food is not supposed to be indian nor chinese
It's a whoe diff realm! My second time I found my favorite dish and I stick to it
Sometimes it's hard to stay open minded after one dissapointing meal, but it's worth the shot
For those of you who thought the meal was so blend, please go back and try their spicey chicken dishes
It's awesome
For all the modest comforts it has to offer, we're regulars at this quiet and cozy find on busy Third Avenue
It's recently undergone remodeling, cleaning up nicely, upping the ambience and intimate dining experience
The Dali Lama's photo, however, still looks on the guests as ever before
The food is wonderful for cold weather, and particularly delicious and soothing are the soups
Our favorite is the lamb meat stew with pasta, vegetables, and cottage cheese
The soups/stews alone make a substantial dinner per person
The staff is a little stoic, but the service is prompt and attentive
exceptionally bad service
as if the waiter learned how to badly service customer in school and applied it to his work
perhaps he's the valedictorian of that class
anyways, the waiter was rude, throwing utensils and chopsticks around as if he hates to serve
miscalculated the check, didn't even say thank you while we walked out

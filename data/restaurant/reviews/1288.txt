It has a very chill atmosphere, good drinks, good service, good food
Nice place to come to for a light snack with some drinks or just to hang out at the bar or outside on their roof
The only HUGE negative I have about them is if you to their for dinner, you'll spend a fortune before you get satisfied
The portions are very small and this isnt the kind of place you can go and take a bunch of tapas to share between a few people
even the entrees while great tasting were very small
It felt as if we went to a Spanish restaurant owned by the French, which were imposing their size portions
The two of us dropped almost 200 for a dinner with 2 drinks each after which we were still hungry
Other then that, nice place
I went there on Saturday night for a birthday
This place was rocking!!! Great music, hot girls, people partying there asses off
GREAT PARTY
Can't wait to go again
While I was there, three different people confronted the bartender, asking if there was any Vodka in their drinks
I paid for 3 Grey Goose w/ splash tonic ($11 each) and left without even the slightest buzz
Same with three of my friends, and five other strangers
Crowded, overpriced, watered down meat market
Don't even bother, waste your time or money

Myself and out-of-town friends attempted to go to Barna this past Saturday
Let's just say we can never have that night back
Do yourself a favor, and stay far away from Barna
Went to Barna on a weekday night to catch up with an old friend
From the maitre'd to our waiter, the service was friendly and impressively responsive
And the atmosphere: impeccable
Intimate and romantic to say the least
And then there was the food! We sampled at least eight tapas plates and enjoyed nearly every one of them
After our reasonably priced meal (for a trendy Manhattan restaurant) we headed up to the roof for drinks
It sports both an indoor and outdoor section, so if your schtick is champagne on the sofa or martinis under the sky, Barna's got you covered
Will definitely return
A group of 5 friends and I went to Barna for dinner for my 30th birthday this past Monday (August 22, 2005)
We received bad service and several of our orders were wrong, missing an ingredient, or missing altogether
Perhaps it was because the 20% tip was already added to the bill, but the waiter brought us plain gazpacho without any of the other ingredients described on the menu; later, when we complained, he brought us saucers of garnish instead of new bowls of the soup properly prepared
Then, he managed to mix up a sauteed spinach order with a spinach salad, and at the end of the meal, we realized that he had completely forgotten to bring a side of french fries that we had ordered at the beginning of the meal
I don't think there was anything new and exciting about this place
The food was below average, the service equally so, and the sangria doesn't compare to the other Spanish restaurants that are in the area
Definitely wasn't worth the trip the first time, highly doubt I'll go back
I was there last Tuesday with a few friends around 9pm
Super cool space, much hipper then anything on Park ave
in that neighborhood and a great staff including some very attractive bartenders matched with a beautiful crowd
We hung out by the bar mostly to ourselves, not an overwelming social crowd, but there were some georgous groups of hipsters looking like it was their meeting up before going out to the clubs (a few of the girls looked like top models), but the vibe was real chill
My one friend ordered some tappas at the bar -- I had a bite of the octupus which was great and he said they were all good, but I will have to taste for myself before I make my formal decision
Overall, great new spot they may turn into one of my favorate hangouts
We attended a going away party for a friend at this place
The decor is great, the service is good, but the food sucks
The have a fairly limited menu, and I opted for the sea bass
It is hard to go wrong with sea bass, but somehow the chef managed to screw it up, it was completely tasteless
Besides that the food is priced in the medium ot high range
That said, I wouldn't go to Barna for dinner, but it is not a bad place to get a drink
In all fairness however, the place has only been open a short while - maybe the cook needs to find his zone
Food was excellent and totally authentic
Gets a great crowd on the weekend with tons of good looking women
The roof bar was the perfect spot for a drink before going downstairs for dinner
Consider me a regular!
Best roof top North of the Thompson Hotel, great place to meet for drinks after work
The food downstairs is great too
I had dinner at this place the other night and I have finally found my local everyday restaurant that is both affordable and has great food
It is only a matter of time before my secret is discovered though
I threw a party for 20 last Saturday night
What a great place for group dining! The food was amazing along with the price and everyone was very accomodating
So much fun too! Will definitely add to my list of places to come back to
Looking forward to more sangria and tapas
I went into this store for the first time about 2 months ago
This is not really the typical kind of place for the neighborhood
I was very surprised, the juices are excellent
I give it a high rateing
I've been back almost every week since
I recommend the Ginger Zen with extra ginger
If you are a fan of ginger - you'll love it
Juice Generation is a nice addition to our neighborhood
A very clean and upscale place where I can get a qet a quick and healthy lunch at a reasonable price
The smoothies are good and I really like the fact that they offer organic soups
A good place to try if you are in the area
I love this place! Originally I went in for just an orange juice but I go back for smoothies and muffins all the time
They now have nice sandwhiches and really good soups for the winter time
Definitely reccomend
I went there for a quick lunch, and quick lunch I got
The assembly-line style counter was a bit of a turn-off, but is to be expected in a fast food joint
The food wasn't too bad for fast food, although the steak in my burrito was a little overcooked
It was extremely fast, and it was a nice alternative to all the sandwich joints on that block
Agree with everything in an earlier review, Assembly Line Mexican Experience
Besides Chipotle's other faults, I'd add that the service is pretty crummy at its very best
The employees don't seem to be stockholders
The only reason this restaurant doesn't receive my not recommended recommendation is that most of its competitors on Montague St
in Brooklyn Heights are a lot worse
This is yet another fast-food chain that turns eating into a mechanical, soul-less experience
The place looks like the inside of a factory, with its steel drums, over-amped A/C and hard wooden benches, and the industrial decor seeps into overly streamlined menu and passionless food
Don't go there if you want anything other than a burrito
You won't even find a chipotle there
No tortilla chips with your order
No salads, soups, enchiladas, tortas, flautas, tostadas, or rellenos to be found
If you think eating a burrito should be like taking a quick hit from an industrial fast-food IV, this'll serve you fine, but finding real Mexican somewhere else will serve you much better
this place was a wonderful discovery, especially just before our theatre
amazing veal parmigiana and someone else had the osso bucco
fell off the bone! run, don't stop
We stumbled on this lovely place while walking in the theater district getting tickets to a show
What a find
It was around 8:30 at night and they had a trio playing jazz as a background to the dining room
It was excellent
I ordered the Branzino which was so moist and flavorful on top of a bed of broccoli rabe with slices of browned garlic, incredible
They have spagetti and Meatballs on the menu and I hadn't had that in ages except my Mom's and this was really good

A very nice hostess showed us around and seated us downstairs in the garden
There was a waterfall on the wall, beautiful
I had open ravioli with lobster so delicious
My mom had the linguine and realy loved it, and she is hard to please
I think the great wine selection might have helped! Our waiter was very good and knowledgeble, even directed us to the theater, which was nice
We had an excellent meal, that put us in the right mood for the play
I go to many restaurants, but this one has a very interesting menu
I had pappardelle with chucks of wild boar!!!!! It was wildly delicious
The meat was tender and very tasty
Pappardelle - very good
The service was attentive and friendly
I spilled my wine, they brought me another on the house without me even asking, which was nice
The decor is cozy and elegant, the tall ceilling gives the space a distinctive aura
Besides the location and the decor I highly recommend the food, if you are a meat lover, like me, I urge you to try the wild boar pappardelle
Excellent pasta as well
I went on a friends recommendation and wow
I had the best gnocchi ever
I highly recommend it
It was served with lobster and sundried tomatoes, realy excellent
The service was very good
Our waiter recommended a great desert and we went off to the theater
Impeccable service, great food and a nice wine collection all wraped up in a beautiful interior
Check out the downstrais garden
Realy impressive
My girlfriend and I tried their risotto at a recommendation of a co-worker, who dines there often
We went and realy enjoyed it
The risotto was so delicious, sereved with shrimp, squid and clams
Excellent, I highly recommend it
The service was attentive and fast
The decor is very pleasant
They have a great wine list
We will definately be back!!!
A group of my girlfriends and I went to see Wicked
We needed a restaurant to go to before the theater and this one was recommemnded to me by a friend
I was a little aprehensive, because it was 9 of us and pre-theater restaurants tend to rush you, especially a large group like that
A few of my girlfriends are from Atlanta, so I wanted to show them a good time in New York
Boy was this place the right choice! The food was phenomenal and the waiter was the nicest, most attentive I've encountered in a long time
One of us ordered the worg martini and the manager replaced it on the house for the apparent mix-up
Well, phenomenal place really
The food was delicious, the decor gorgeous and the location fabulous
I highly recommend it!
My husband took me here for my birthday dinner, before taking me to the theater
We had a wonderful time
The food was exquisite
I haven't had italian pasta like that since our honeymoon in Tuscony
My husband had the pizza, which was great
We were seated in the downstrais garden, that is so romantic
I had such a great experience, I want to let everyne know
If you have a special dinner planned this place won't disappoint
A great pre theater place and a very romantic one
My boyfriend took me to this restaurant for the first time 3 yrs ago on our first date
We had a great time then and ever since
We go there quite often mainly for the fabulous food and the romantic ambiance, but I recommended it to a few friends for their first dates and they all love it and are still together
We all decided the place makes for a great date spot and it's like a good luck charm! I especially recommend the downstrais for a romantic dinner
As for the food, my favorite is the pizza with 4 different cheeses and the chicken balsamico, my boyfriend loves the veal
The food is really great, the atmosphere so nice and romantic plus there is something in the air
I highly recommed it for dates
My boyfriend took me there for a dinner prior to a show
The whole experience was wonderful
The ambience resembeled that of the romantic movies
We were seated downstrais in the secret garden
We had a table in the corner, by a water fall wall on a elevated balcony
fabulous
If that wasn't enough, the food added to the evening
I had the Chicken balsamico, which was really delicious
We shared a desert and went off to see a show
It was a perfect evenning
If you're looking for a good date place, I highly recommend it
We definately will be back
I had pre-theater dinner there with 10 of my friends
It was great
They took our reservation only 3 days prior to the show
We were seated promptly, even though the restaurant was busy when we arrived
The staff was so cordial from the moment we got in
Our waiter was attentive and very funny; he made us feel very comfortable
I had the black tanglierne pasta w/a delicious souce
Everyone was raving about the food
The pizza was out of this world
We all had a great time
We got out on time and went to see Wicked
There are not many places that will make a pre-theater dinner for 11 a good experience, they did an amazing job
I highly recommend it
The food was definitely not cooked fresh
A dish that said it would require an additional 15 minute wait was on the table before we finished our salad
The meal included some clams which tasted awful
Other people at the table ordered dishes with chicken breast that was definitely precooked and reheated
The chicken was dry and tasteless
The coffee was like mud
We all had the feeling that we were being rushed out for the evening theater crowd
It was also pretty expensive and not worth the money
Every year for my birthday, my mother and I go to a broadway show, always stopping for a bite in the theater district
We found out about this place online, and decided to try it for pre-theater
It was amazing
The atmosphere was beautiful, very charming and romantic
We opted for theirs amazing prix-fixe pre-theater menu
The choices ranged from Farfalle Aurora to Spezzatino di Pollo al Funghi to Grilled Salmon in Brown Butter Sauce
Both my mother and I opted for the salmon
The first two courses were a delicious green salad and bruschetta, the entree and then dessert, which was equally as amazing
Our waiter caitered to our every wish, even buying me a special desert for my birthday
Overall it was perfict! It was the best place to celebrate my sweet 16! I reccomend it to any group of people looking for a great time in NY!

This place is amazing
The location which is a former Vault (as in money), was transformed into a speak easy type restaurnt influenced by the Irish Managing Partners background, as well as the hot staff, the Bartender(ess), is inticing with her accent, as well was heavy pouring hand
The food is all priced to please, huge beer list, as well as wine and cocktails, a massive space, with room to socialize and mingle as the bankers stop in after a long day, tourists find their way in, singles go there following the stream of attractive professionals they see heading in
Recently featured by a Womans magazine as one of the top places to meet men, there is an incresaignly guy girl ratio
After finally going there this weekend, I thought it a true disappointment!!! The captain served us the entree smiling while cursing in italian with somebody else of the staff and he brought me the check before I have even finished brewing my tea
The food, average and expensive
The whole experience, just not worth it
Table ready and waiting when we arrived
Food was delicious and well paced from the kitchen
Never felt rushed
Staff was efficient and available but not intrusive
Everyone thanked us for our patronage as we left for the evening
Can't wait to go back!
It will be nice when the cafe opens as well as the formal dining area
I took guests and it is nice to say that the place still has it's magic
This is a special place of regulars and great for people watching
Nice wines by the galss at the bar
Thumbs up, in fact, I give it a Boooya!
My wife and I went on the first Saturday it opened
We loved Le Cirque 2000 and had great expectations
The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating but needed more polish
You could definitely tell the professional wait staff from the first timers in terms of service
The food was excellent and the contemporary atmosphere very enjoyable
We saw some celebs -- Cindy Adams, Mike Wallace and Barbara Walters, which was fun, but I think Sirio is hoping for a crowd whose average age is under 80
Very sleek bar/lounge area but they did not have a cocktail menu,which was annoying
It was expensive -- but not outrageous -- and was worth it
We're glad we went, but we both felt that Del Posto was better in terms of a grand, new NYC restaurant
Several interesting flavors like watermelon, green tea, chrysanthemum, wasabi, corn (be sure and ask for a taste before you decide!)
They also have less adventurous flavors like black cherry, vanilla, tiramisu, mango
BUT my absolute favorite is honeydew! It's fantastic!!
I WALKED BY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND SAW THIS TRENDY SHOP AND DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY, SO I ORDERED THE GREEN TEA FLAVOR , AND IT'S THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!! IT'S SO DELICIOUS!! I ALREADY WENT BACK A FEW TIMES ALREADY, AND FOUND OUT THEY HAVE SOME FLAVORS THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD BEFORE, LOVE THEM ALL!!!FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES ICE CREA AS MUCH AS I DO, YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE
A co-worker had to move, and the first thing she asked for when she visited was Aceluck's red curry
Eating there is speedy, and delivery is always timely
Their lunch specials can't be beat!
Absolutely the best Thai food near Port
I work on 41st and 8th and our office orders from them for lunch
Love the wine selections and service
I have a friend that lives near this restaurant
He been nagging me to try this place
You have to try this place
the food is decilous, I take all my friends there
So I finally went and I was impress! Food was just amazing
really
Even though I'm not vegetarian, I love their tofu and vegetarian duck
This restaurant delivers lunch specials (try the red curry and pineapple fried rice)
And it's under $8 bucks!
I always order from Aceluck and the food has always been consisently good
One of my favorite places to order from
I am a big fan of thai and asian fusion food and at any oppertunity drop by any of this new thai joints mushrooming all over the city - with friends, but mostly with my family
With a few exception most of this places are average to mundane
The other day while I was passing by 9th Ave the decor in attractive purple color caught my eyes and since then I wanted to give this place a try - today I did and I am thankful for it
Simply put it is the best Thai food I ever had
Everything we had was absolutely delicious - the seafood special was a knockout and so was the noodle dish (pad see wue)
The atmosphere was charming and interesting and the service superb
I will recommend to anybody who loves thai or spicy food and I can promise them they wont be sorry for trying it
My wife threw a surprise birthday party for me here last Sunday and it was an absolute thrill
Not only was i surprised by the gesture, but by the restaurant
I don't know of any other Thai eatery that services its customers with such warmth
(Maybe because we went there pretty early in the evening and the place didn't fill up yet
) I asked my wife why she picked Q2 and she told me that she orders from this place at least 2x a week
Her coworkers at Time Warner Building introduced her to this 9th Avenue joint and she's hooked
I loved the food
try their fish and chips, yum yum calamari salad and summer chicken shumai
My 50th bash couldn't have been better
To top things off, they came out with complimentary dessert for all of our twelve guests
What a birthday!
Since I'm just visiting my brother who lives in the city, he recommend this place
So we went lastnight
I wasn't expecting anything much
I was wrong
the service overall was great and as a bonus, the beautiful atmophere added to the fun that I was already having
The food was good
I believed whoever designed the place was a genius
Instead of having a normal and boring (white light) and tables
Too bad I don't live adjacent to New York City (I'm from Oregon
), I would go back there in a heartbeat
Their prices are reasonable as well (according to my brother)
I love love love Q2's atmosphere
It's comfortable and clean and vibrant
The service isn't bad; the waiters are friendly, and sometimes when you're lucky, they serenade you with the latest pop tunes
Above all, I enjoy their food
The basic menu's authentic Thai food to the capital T, but the summer menu is fusion
My best friend got me hooked on the Sesame salmon
SEARED to PERFECTION
Ninth Avenue's got a buncha Thai restaurants lined up, but none give you the option of trying something new and different
I don't really care what anyone says
The color pink has never been hotter
If you catch a glimpse of the eatery, you'll know what I mean
Not only is the decor of Q2 is fun so is their menu, with interesing choices such as Duck rolls, Cashew chicken and much more
The service was good and the owner was very friendly and hands on
He came out many times to check up on his customers and make sure everything was satisfactory
Q2 is a def
must try if you are in Hell's Kitchen!
This place is amazing! The atmosphere is unique compare to other restaurants that I been to
Why
just check out their website and your see what I mean
I been there a few times
Overall their prices are affordable and light on the wallet
The food was tasty and service was wonderful
Their waiters were friendly and professional

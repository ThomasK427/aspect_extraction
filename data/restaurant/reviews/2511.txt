the service was prompt and helpful
the restaurant is tight and you might have to wait
we went for breakfast so we only waited about five minutes
i would DEFINITELY go back again
I live a short distance from Amy Ruth's and I everytime someone comes to visit me I take them here
The food is good and they are open 24 hours on the weekends
I recommend the fried catfish and the mac and cheese
Amazing!! For those early morning late night
drunk club feasts
go for the Michael Basdin- waffles with bananas and walnuts
hmm
hits the spot at 4am
The only thing that usually and almost always sucks is the service
a bit slow
and sometimes a bit rude, but if you can ignore that
then Amy Ruth's is perfect
The food here is below average
If you want a real taste of soul food this is NOT the place to go
You end up paying more then it's worth
This place is overrated
The food was great so that made up for the lack of service from the waitress
The gentlemen who backed her up, I believe his name is Pablo was great! He re filled our water and removed dirty dishes
I had the fried okra, salmon croquettes and the macaroni and cheese
The price are decent
I will come back again
The only complaint was the fact that we had to stand outside in the cold for a table and the place wasn't even full
But I will still come back
The dining room is a little tight, but once you get seated you're in for a treat
I have enjoyed everything I've tried
Come ready to eat because you're going to get huge portions
Sometimes it seems like you get too much food
But you can always take a doggie bag
The staff is friendly
The food is good
What more could you want?
I've never had a bad dining experience at Amy Ruth's
You go here for the food! The chicken and waffles are slammin'
This is where you go to unbuckle your belt and chow down! Dining upstairs is more pleasant than downstairs, though the top floor is only opened when it gets crowded
The mac and cheese is perfect, the sweet yams are tasty
everything is great
I always have the same waiter (I believe his name is Adou?)
The price is right
around $15 pp
Highly recommended if you want tasty soul food minus the (pricey) frills
I was so excited when a menu for Amy Ruths was handed to me advertising that they will deliver
How dissapointed was I when I finally called to make the order! I was told my the waitress that I was lazy because I wanted delivery! Then she told me that they didn't deliver to my area when it was on THEIR menu! Finally my food arrived and my ice tea that I only added on so that I could make $20 get delivery was missing
So again I called and was told that when I came in I could get a free ice tea which is just stupid I told them that was unacceptable since I would not be going to their restaurant anytime soon
I was put on hold, no one ever picked up
If this is how they treat their customers how will they treat your food?
I was told of Amy Ruths via word of mouth
I tried it and loved it
I loved the food and family friendly atmosphere
I pretty much feel at home when I eat there
My favorite is the smothered chicken, waffle with chicken, and I love the various lemonades they have in the summer season
Eat with confidence at Amy Ruths
I took my husband and kids here for father's day and we all loved it
The food was incredibly delicious
This is definitely one of New Yorks best places to eat at
We all loved the food and had a good time
On a scale of 1 - 10 this is definitely a 10
I heard about Amy Ruths on the food channel so I was in New York on vacation May 25-29,2005 and thought I would try it
The food was really good, I had the fried chicken,sweet potatoes,and mac cheese
The staff was real friendly and the food came super fast
I went on a Friday afternoon and it there was no wait to seated
Had two friends visiting New York from Florida
One had heard about Amy's Ruth from the cooking channel
We all agreeded that the side dishes we ordered (were not good) The collard greens seem like it had too much vinegar in them string beans were too salty
We also, had the chicken fish (that was good)  Would not recommend
There's no way to truly do justice to the food at Amy Ruth's
it's a symphony for your tastebuds! The 'bad-boy' waffle was sooo good, that the only bad thing was that I couldn't finish it all! Amy Ruth's may be in Harlem, far from the glow of the lights of Times Square, but it's absolutely worth the trip
Over a year ago, I travelled from Brooklyn to Harlem just to taste Amy Ruth's catfish that my friend was raving about, and it was divine, so was the mac-n-cheese and greens
I am now a Vegetarian, and I recently found out that Amy Ruth's has a Vegetarian section on their menu, smile
We went here on a Saturday (mid to late afternoon) and the restuarant was full but there was no wait and we were seated right away
It's small on the inside and the seats are really close together
None of this matters though because the food was really good! You cannot go here without trying the honey-dipped fried chicken
Im sorry I didn't take a cue from the patrons sitting around me and ordered some takeout! Will definitely go back when I am in New York again
This place is overpriced and the food is mediocre at best
I was excited about checking it out after reading the reviews, but we left disappointed
I recommend Miss Mamie's, now that's good food at a good price!
I was so happy to pop by Amy Ruth's not too long ago and sample some of their excellent food
I grew up in the south, and they do it right here
Unfortunately I was too full for the sweet potato pie, though!
They have the yummiest mac and cheese
The next time I go, I plan to order a double mac and cheese and skip the other sides
The honey fried chicken melts in your mouth, and is made with fresh honey from the bees on the roof of the restaurant
I'm not usually a fan of waffles, but I tried my friend's and they were so light and crispy, in short, the best waffles I have ever had
(Sorry mom!)  You may have to wait, but who cares, this place is so deliciously wonderful, it's worth waiting
And I'm sure if you were nice, the restaurant staff would let you stay inside while you wait on a freezing cold day
Anytime I am in NY, I always make a trip to Amy Ruth's
Let me tell you, if this is your first time, you HAVE to try the honey dipped fried chicken
It is the BOMB! I need to get the recipie because it is more than honey in that sauce
The mac n cheese is really good, just like mom's and the greens are good too
That's all I ever get, but my roomate got the pork chops and they looked delicious
Oh, the yams are the bomb
I can't say too much more than you have to try it for yourself because it is worth every penny and the slightly crowded atmosphere
It doesn't look like a restaurant, it looks like somebody's kitchen
They have additional seating upstairs
The food is delectable
Tastes like home-cooking
really

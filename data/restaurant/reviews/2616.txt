the service is very efficient and professionel
and the dessert are delicious and comes from payard
what a treat
A wonderful experience at Restaurant Charlotte
The Chilean Sea Bass for dinner was great along with the service and ambiance
Great new menu
Person taking order didn't understand or speak english clearly
Wrote down wrong phone number and failed to correct after I called 3 times to ask about my order
Never got my order and was not helped at all
Never order from this place for delivery
You will probably not get your order as long as the order taker doesn't speak english
Sometimes, nyc is like a foreign country
Simple delivery is more than it's worth
There isn't much particular to reccomend insofar as the food here: almost everything on the menu is adequate to satisfy a quick Thai-fix
But it's among the cheapest eats in Midtown
You get huge portions of the stuff, and for only $6-$7
This price is hard to beat at the street fairs
Nothing is great, although I do have to give recognition to the very well-flavored Pad Kee Mao (despite their use of the wrong-sized noodle)
Thumbs down to the blandish, slightly sour Pad Thai, though
The cuts of beef in the beef dishes are average at best, though the shrimp is consistently good
Take-out is the name of the game; you COULD eat inside, but really -- you don't want to
This is the kind of cheap Thai food I have been looking for
Great, hot food at good prices (not rock bottom, but decent), served before you even sit down
This is a super-casual place, very crowded at lunch but not at all for dinner hours
Highly recommended by a Thai food snob
I work around the corner and though there are many other Thai places to order from, I personally consider this one the best - hands down
The food is the only reason I like visiting Yum
Other than that the place isn't anything to write home about
Great for a quick meal when you need something to spice up your day
Big portions, good prices, delicious food
I would come here very week when I worked in the neighborhood
Now I work elsewhere, and I really miss it! If going for lunch, best to go by 12:30, even if getting take-out, the place is tiny and fills up quickly, both with people eating there, and standing waiting for take-out orders
The best Thai I've had
Anything I've ordered, I've enjoyed immensely
I'm convinced that they don't make a bad dish
The place is small, and it looks like a take out joint, but the food tastes MUCH better than the place looks
it doesn't look like it would serve especially good food, but the veggie pad thai i had there was amazing
big portions and cheap too
Duck red curry is awesome, and the price is just right
The only thing that keeps me from coming here more often is that I have to hike over from Third Ave
Ditto on the A/C comment
On hot summer days, the place can get incredibly warm so you might consider doing takeout as many others do
DON'T GO! The service and the food were terrible
It was not a busy night; however you still can not get the waiter's attention
We ordered appetizers and entrees and the wait time was torturous
It seemed like eternity for them to bring out the appetizers and the main course was just as bad
On top of the wait time, they also mixed up two orders and the food was over priced and disappointing
Went there with a group of about 12 and we were given a cozy corner filled with couches and armchairs
Waiter was more than helpful when it came to recommending a great wine in our price range
We ordered so many drinks that the 2 or 3 appetizers that we did order were paid for by the house
We stayed for about 3 hours and were left on our own but not ignored when we needed something
Great place!!
After a LENGTHY closing, I was pleasantly surprised when Figaro's reopened
Nice clean new look; the prices on the menu are still reasonable and there is a great variety
I had lunch with 3 friends of mine, all ordered different pasta dishes and we all loved each of ours!
I have passed it many times but only just went in
It gives an impression of quaintness, convenience and quality from the outside BUT wait until you get inside! I went for lunch and the staff does not welcome you upon entering
Most of the waiters have their shirts untucked and round-the-clock shadow on their faces
The lunch menu looks like they had taken the least expensive items off of a coffee shop menu and left the most expensive ones
My chicken was drenched in airline quality brown sauce without vegetables or anything
Take it from this luxury hotel concierge: grab a beer, drink it and leave
Waiting for my girl to finish work, I walked into this place because I saw tv's above the bar, to sit and get a beer and watch a game
The crowd is mixed w/guests from the nearby hotels, afterwork suits, and regulars there to relax
I now go about once a week, they know my drink and my girl's drink too
make it when we walk in
They have the best linguini w/red clam sauce and the price is cheap for NYC standards
I feel like a local when I'm there, even though I live at the Jersey shore
I just love eating there
The food is always good, service impeccable and it's open super late
I came there last summer at 11:15 pm and they still seated us and were very nice, not trying to push us out of the restaurant like most other places open late do
I would recommend La Surprise, le Steak au Poivre or la Cote de Boeuf
I never tried any fish there, but I guess it would be a heresy to try one at such a great meat place
The French fries are perfect, crusty and light, and the bread they serve is the closest I found in kosher restaurants to a Parisian baguette
They have an extensive wine list and the desserts are very fine, without being fantastic
A much better deal than Solo
I lived in New York for three years, and Le Marais was always the best kosher experience I had
I go there literally every time that I return
A superb dining experience, I highly recommend the second floor
Remember, restaurants were the theater of the 80s--Les Marais is about the excitement of the entire district! A single-malt to die for
It's hard to believe that this is Kosher
People looking for bland kosher food be forwarned
Excellent food, fine French cuisine
My compliment to a kitcheners ,very friendly personal
Our waiter Ulrich was kind and gave us just the right amount of attention
The food was surprisingly delicious, the prices very reasonable, and I would recommend Le Marais to any friend
This is THE place for grilled meats
If you like a good steak, if you are a meat lover, this is the best place in town, Kosher or not
Try the Cote de Boeuf for two, it is the best Dish in the place
Do not waist your money on any of the other items on the menu they are there for decoration! Don't be lured by the fancy names, order the grilled Meats and you'll see that this place is worth more than what you pay for it
Nice place
But it really needs to improve the food
Good for Kosher restaurant
Food very good, nice seats
Had to wait a while for a table, even with reservations
Good midtown location
Great Food - poor service, I would recommend the steak
We booked but still waited half an hour
This is a great resturant for amny reasons: -There is a variety of food (it's all good) -You are seated right away and it is not corwded -Great value -If you need a caterer this is the palce -Overall, one of the best returants around
Amazing pizza, everyone should try it
The waitstaff is great, quick and witty

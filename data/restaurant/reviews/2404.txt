But it IS popular for a very good reason: It is fun!! and ALWAYS FABULOUS!
I hadn't the chance to eat dinner, I had actually gone to the restaurant for dessert
I shared a slice of Creme de La Creme Cheesecake , along with a frozen Hot chocolate
The cheesecake was orgasmic
I had extremely high expectations for it, and sure enough, serendipity hit it right on the money
The frozen hot chocolate is a must, when you go, but it tastes like mochaccino
Which is by all means good, but when i do it again, I'm going with some sort of espresso drink layered in fresh whipped cream, and a slice of cheesecake for MYSELF
And remember, if youre going for dessert, arrive an hour in advance to get your name on the list
And believe me, it's worth the wait
Came for a friend's birthday one Friday early afternoon
Was quite surprised there wasn't the customary 1 hour line
This place is hyped- its really atmosphere and reputation you're eating
The food isn't all that great, the seating is cramped, and the staff takes their time
Things here are expensive, so if you really want to try the place out, have dessert, which really is wonderful and HUGE! but skip the dinner
And do try to get here early- the line isn't worth waiting for
Be careful with the kids- they can't run around here
The not-so-friendly-cigarette-reeking waiter asked if we had any questions then when we did ask, he rolled his eyes and covered his face with the menu to say something to a passing coworker
He would interrupt us mid-sentence to say something abrupt and rude then leave and come back 15 minutes later
I highly doubt he represents most of the staff (i hope)
The garlic cheese sauce on my niece's pasta was more like garlic flavored clear broth--terrible! Another chicken dish drenched in lemon butter sauce was bland and thick--her side of fries (which we had to request as an additional side because when she requested the fries be substituted for the salad that comes with her meal, Mr
Friendly replied a quick No
) were half frozen
and 13 bucks for a dessert crepe??? The generous portion of Frozen Hot Chocolate was yummy but not the fantasy it is advertised to be
We are in New York visiting MSKCC for our 3 year old daughter's cancer treatment
Every one recommended that we go to Serendipity 3
We left early to beat the crowds, myself, husband, 3YR old daughter, and 10M old son
Upon arriving, they yelled at us that we needed to leave our strollers on the street, they were not allowed in the restaurant
We left our strollers out not knowing if they would be there when we finished
Inside, we were treated to stares, as if I can't believe you brought children in here, and were treated only marginally kindly
We got the distinct impression that children were NOT welcome
The food was good, and the atmosphere would have been enjoyable if we had not felt that they couldn't wait for us to get the kids out
Fine restaurant, but I definitely would NOT taut it as kid friendly
This restaurant is too overrated
Service was not friendly, they sometimes forget they are suppose to serve the customers and not herd them around like cattle
My #1 objective in coming here was to see what a Frozen Hot Chocolate could be
Well, it was all it was hyped up to be and more! You might think it's a milk shake, but it's definitely Frozen Hot Chocolate! Your only decision is when to have it - with your meal or as a dessert
My recommendation is to bring it on early and enjoy
The rest of the meal was good and the atmosphere very festive
This is a don't miss if you are anywhere close to the area, but if you're going for lunch, be there by noon to avoid a wait
I can see why they made a movie involving this place
While it is small and the wait was 2+ hours (Just make a reservation to circumvent that problem) it was well worth the wait
The frozen hot chocolate is 8 bucks and has 17 kinds of chocolate in it
SO GOOD
I suggest skipping a cab and walking back after eating these desserts, you won't feel so guilty after
I recently dined at Serndipity and it was great! I went after a play and loved that it is open until 12am during the week
The burgers are great, and the frozen peanut butter hot chocolate was the best dessert I've ever had!!! Service was so so, but that's anywhere in NY
If you love chocolate, this is the place for you!!
This place is totally overrated
The front desk is disorganized (couldn't find my reservation made a week in advance); service is below-par; food is just so so; the most expected dessert turned out to be disappointed
This place is cute, its a NY Landmark
but beyond all that, its JUST PLAIN OLD HYPE
The first time I went there Iwas expecting a magical experience, I was met with a near claustophbic attack due to bottleneck congestion in the foyer, andso so food, a huge frozen hot chocolate that frankly I could easily make at homeand a bill for 78
00
Was it a repeat? NO
Will I go there again? YES, because of course any visiting friends or relatives who know of it absolutely insist on having their own Serendipity experience!! So
off we will go and my feelings will not change
But its one of NYC's faces that people love to glorify because its such a NYC thing
So, go if you must, but don't set the bar too high
Perhaps I will move back to NYC someday, where I spent a wonderful 3 years, but one location holds a special place in my heart
and belly - Serendipity 3
This eclectic Upper East Side restaurant is an absolute must visit for chocolate lovers (like ME)
Very few desserts can hit the spot quite as well as a frozen hot chocolate
And, although the food may seem overpriced to some, the portions are large and the food is very tasty
Yes, the wait to get in sounds/looks horrific, but it's not
And
it's always worth it
You must realize that going to Serendipity is more than going out to get dessert - it really is a special event
I now live 11,000 miles away, but I will return to NYC again and again
at least for a frozen hot chocolate
Originally, we went with the intent of eating and then having dessert
this is not possible so we went back and just got dessert
The first time, I had the steak char char
It was possibly the best steak I have ever had
Comes with a delicious salsa
The second time, I had strawberry fields which was delicious
I also tryed my families pink lemonade ice and signature hot chocolate which were both devine! If we had been in NYC any longer, we probably would have went back again
There always seems to be a wait but the host is kind enough to take your name and tell you to check back in in 30 minutes
Bloomies is close by so you can shop while you wait! Very crowded entry way
I have been to Serendipity's more than a couple of times, and no matter how many chances I give the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate, I simply cannot and do not understand the hype surrounding it
Try the Pink Ice instead, which is surprisingly refreshing
The Dark Double Devil Mousse is rich and satisfying
But skip the overpriced entrees and appetizers; the dessert portions are gigantic and filling
Get there early to minimize the wait, or make a reservation
It is crowded even during lunch on Wednesdays
The service is friendly and generally helpful, although a little slow at times
I have been here 2 times and I have to say that despite the negative reviews I think it's a NYC gem
The service we got was great, never an empty glass on the table
Although the place is loud (due to LOADS of toddlers), the frozen hot chocolate cannot be missed and it's just a really fun place to go
We arrived early (11-15AM) so only had to wait in line until the place opened
and were seated and had drinks very promptly
After reading some of the reviews, I was a little nervous about taking my visiting family to Serendipity, but thought it might be fun for the kids
We had a reservation for Monday lunch and were seated promptly, which was a pleasant surprise
It did, however, take 30 minutes for our waiter to take our order, but he was pleasant enough and the food was good and not terribly expensive
Skip the Frrrozen hot chocolate and try the Humble Pie or the Broadway Sundae
It was overall a good experience although I doubt I'll go back unless I have out-of-towners who want to go
It's a very cutsie, novelty place that you might want to check out once if you are in the area and have nothing better to do
I wouldn't make a special trip to go there, unless you are taking people from out of town
Ffffrozen Hot Chocolate was good
It tasted like a few packages of Ghiradelli cocoa, crushed ice and melted double chocolate ice cream
(that's probably the recipe, so if you can't make the trip to Serendipity, try whipping that up in a blender) Service was excellent though

The food is outstanding! My husband and I often bring friends to dinner there, and everyone has loved it as much as we have
As a vegetarian, I find it hard to find a restaurant that will make an interesting entree for me
At Fresh, I have learned to trust them completely - I have consistently received a magnificantly prepared and presented dish
And it's always been different than the last time - it makes me feel as if they created something for me, instead of giving me the standard oh-great-we-have-a-vegetarian-give-her-pasta-primavera
Don't miss the Chocolate Variations
I dream about this dessert for days after going to Fresh
The food was only mediocre, and the seats were uncomfortable
The wine did not come until we were half way through our entree and the waitress overcharged us by a bottle of wine
It was a very disappointing experience
Went there for my 2 year anniversary and had an awesome experience! We had concluded that this was one of, if not, the best (american) seafood restaurant we've been to in NYC so far (does not included sushi restaurants = different category)
The Louis Latour Chardonnay went amazingly well with the smoked corn/crab chowder and the scallop/tuna ceviche
We told them we had a show to catch and the timing of the food was like clockwork
Decor is spacious, blue and cool - you feel like you are in the ocean
We had no problems waiting for anything, but we also went on the early side (before a broadway show)
I thought the food was inventive without going overboard
The menu selection was vast, but our server helped out a lot with suggestions
Portion size was very generous, too
I would recommend skipping dessert, though
Fish is fresh, dessert left MUCH to be desired
Cold decoration but great space
Refined and original cuisine, generous entrees portions
It's a pitty that the butter is not real butter
Careful and welcoming staff
After having read the previous reviews I was not impressed and didn't want to go
However, we were seated immediately, served promptly effeciently and politely, and the food was really good
Portions aren't huge, but they are delicately balanced, very well made and very tasty
Desserts were also excellent
Not cheap, but we will go back again and I would not hesitate to recommend the place
It annoys me that there's always a few people willing to trash a good restaurant on city search
The food here is really good-- end of story
the presentation was creative and everything was prepared right without too many unnecessary frills
the fish was very fresh as the name implies and with good fish little needs to be added
The dessert was great
The ambiance leaves something to be desired and reservations are just suggestions
My God
6 months and no sign? I should have kept walking
Inside I discovered a restroom that can only be described as rest stop chic
The staff made a grand show of uselessness right off the bat but they did manage to bring my appetizers one hour after i ordered them
In September I found the food satisfying, if only a bit overpriced
In Jan, the entrees had suffered from the kind of heavy handed creativity that puts places out of business
My thirty five dollar tuna was so overcooked that I could not detect if it was Fresh or canned
When I complained to management, an angry individual rushed to the table (maybe the owner) and ranted about Nova Scotia
I will not set foot in Fresh again
We didn't have a very good experience at Fresh
We had to wait 15 minutes after we were seated just to get a menu and some water! Then we got a lecture on why you can't order tuna steak well done (hint hint: the customer is always right!)
The food was ok, but the portion size was ridiculously small
We were starving afterwards! But the grand finale was the bill: 1 appetizer, 3 main courses, 1 dessert and 2 diet cokes came to a whopping $130+ without tip! Definitely not going back there again, nor will I recommend it
On the recommendation of 2 friends, I went with my boyfriend for a top tier dining experience
After waiting 1 hr after our reservation time, the food was mediocre at best (8:45 res, sat at 10pm)
Its not that we ordered wrong but the descriptions on the menu were overwhelming and made my knowledge of fine cuisine seem elementary
Avoid the Cod and Scallop choice (bland as can be)
The tuna was nothing special either although the price made it seem special
My boyfriend's snapper tasted like an standard fair at a generic italian restuarant
Although I didn't pay, I feel bad for the dent the meal made in my boyfriend's pocket
When on this echelon, I'd choose Bond Street, Nobu or Blue Hill first, without a doubt
I love food and I know when it is great
It is here
What is amazing are the desserts! I started off with the ice cream sandwhich with carmelized bananas and my boyfriend ordered the chocolate trio
Even though we were full from our great meal, being dessert fanatics, we had to order one more
And it was worth it
I highly recommend the molasses cake with the poached pear
Oh, and if you have to eat real food, go for the halibut cheek w/ foie gras and the kobe tuna
Outstanding!
Fresh is a good restaurant
The food is very tasty, though the portion size is quite small
As a result, you need to have appetizer, entree, and dessert to fill up
It is also not a particularly cheap place, either so be prepared to spend a lot of money
WOW! I thought this place really lived up to the name! I was blown away at the foie gras and halibut cheeks appitizer
I felt the service was very attentive and VERY good looking
I can't wait togo back and visit this place for the great fish
The waiters were rude and inexperienced
Everyone at the table did not receive their appetizers or entrees at the same time
The sdie orders that came with the entrees came when we had already completed our meal
when this was brought to the attention of the owner he was uninterested and basically inexperienced in his responses
the food was good, but the menu is very over priced and the service was poor
for an $85 tasting menu, i think we should have gotten our wine (and water) by the time the second course came
we did not, which is why i'm writing this review
granted, it was valentine's day and they were mobbed (excuses, excuses)
for excellent sea food at comparable prices and flawless service, you get much more bang for your buck at milos or le bernardin
expensive but really good
squash soup and codfish were very tasty
crispy whole fish was pretty good too
mackerel was so-so
i left stuffed
We went past sunday to fresh
and we had an amazing experience
Since we eat only fish it was always difficuly to find a fresh seafood restaurant for sundays
We were told they have their own boats that bring the fish it is really noticeable
I had an amazing arctic char appetizer
The halibut steak was divine
We will be back
Service was definitely attentive
Owner came over and explained the architecture - apparently same architect has done interiors for Billy Joel
Food was delish - though portions on the small side in relation to the price
But it was nice to be full, but not *too* full
Try it
it's lovely
scallop and foie gras app was burnt, chowder tasted like dishwater, squid stuffed with short ribs was all salt, salmon was a big hunk of rawness and we love sushi
This was gross
The waitress took it back because she saw it was raw and then she never returned with it again

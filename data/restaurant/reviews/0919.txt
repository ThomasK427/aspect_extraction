The surroundings are picturesque and the drinks are amazing
I had a thoroughly relaxing experience, perfect after a hectic day
(The pan de bono is a must!)
Lucy's was *memorable* but not for the right reasons
We went on a Saturday with a group of 10 and despite our 9pm reservation, were not seated until 10:30pm
The service was so slow that we didn't finish until 1:00am, by which time they turned the lights on
It was my bday and we had a pregnant woman in the group but little effort was made
The hostess leaked that they had sat a large group in front of us at 8pm, which clearly left insufficient time
The food was overpriced for the quality (I know, my boyfriend is Ecuadorian)
The guacamole was the highpoint of the meal
I had the Lucy's Lobster Paella - the flavor was lacking and the seafood overcooked
If you want great ambience and have the patience, go for drinks (the Ginger margarita was excellent)
Have dinner at your own risk!
We've been here about 5-6 times now
The food, service and ambience have always been impeccable
The waitstaff are consistently friendly and make you feel very welcome
The serves are very large, so I'd recommend sharing dishes with a group of 4-6 people
My favorites are the lobster paella, roast pork and whole fish
The appetizers are also wonderful, especially the scallops
Overall, a festive atmosphere in a great neighorhood
I went on a Monday night with my lady
I was waiting for her at the bar and had a drink before she arrived
The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable, and the bar area was very laid back and comfortable
I had the sangria, which was more dry than sweet, which was refreshing
After being seated, we were greeted by a very helpful waiter, who was able to help us decide on our dishes
Empanadas were fantastic, but slightly overpriced ($13 for one)
Good experience overall
Worth it for the ambiance alone
I would return
First, the music was SO loud that I got a sore throat trying to have a conversation with my party
The Hamichi ceviche was horrible!!! Not only was the fish not fresh, but the spices/sauces they used to try to cover up the taste/smell were horrible
The whole snapper was a waste of calories - again the fish was very fishy and the coconut rice was mushy and over cooked
And the shrimp tacos you ask
shrimp cooked to a rubbery perfection, cheap iceberg lettuce and completely uncreative salsas to top it all off! All of this served with a side of the typical BT, untucked button down crowd
I'm a latin food lover
and I always passed by Lucy's and never walked in
I went today and was blown away by the quality of their food and their ambience
The place is full of flavor and color and the music just puts you in the mood for food and drinks
Try the empanadas, they are amazing, so is the Skirt steak
Definitely one of my FAVORITE latin places in town   Try them NOW!
This is the most amazing place, especially if you like Latin food
My fiance and I are getting married and we were originally trying to have the reception at Pipa (Lucy's sister restaurant); that was where we had our first date
The Restaurant Manager suggested we try Lucy as possible alternative
When we walked in, we fell in love
The atmosphere is warm, romantic, classy, and beautiful
Everyone was friendly and attentive
I took my future inlaws to do a tasting and we were served samples of most of the dishes on the menu
EVERYTHING was delicious
The ethnic flavors explode in your mouth and were also presented so elegantly
Every dish they served, one after the other was as delicious as the next
We had a difficult time choosing our wedding reception menu
It's a shame that my guests will not be able to experience Lucy as we did
Eat clubbers said beautifully presented food
Looks so nice on the plate you don't want to eat it
Nice decor Good live music
though a bit loud
As to food quality The duck was fork cuttable, if slightly bland
Best dish: Peruvian Chiape de Mariscos
Best appetizer Columbian cheeserolls
or Columbian shrimp sausage --Eat club is an informal group of NYC eaters
We meet once a month
Allow me to start by saying that I love Latin American culture! This place: the ambience, the food and even the wonderful staff reminded me of my travels to the many Latin American countries I've visited
The setting is just right, from the pictures on the wall to the slated ceiling, it has the spirit of Latin America
The staff, very well chosen, has the warmth of its people
And now to my favorite part: the food! Every bite I took felt like home, I loved every minute of it (I've probably tried everything on their menu and have not been disappointed once)
I'm very picky about my latin places and Lucy has definitely won me over!
Lucy has been on my list for a long time, but it took a hard day at work and a need for decent cocktails food to inspire my boyfriend and I to go
A fantastic waitress appeared as soon as we sat, and, after plying her with questions, she recommended the plates she deemed best for our first experience and appetite level
She hit that nail on the head! While slowly taking in our delicious mojitos (go Mango!), we then dined on columbian cheese bread (courtesy of Lucy), a manchego cheese empanada, and yellowtail ceviche
Our entrees -- a seafood stew, and churrasco (steak), were impeccable
My only recommendation about Lucy -- don't overdue it on the appetizers cheese bread
they are definitely irresistable, but filling! Also, be prepared: Lucy is not cheap, but it is worth every penny (especially after a hard day at the office
)
My girlfriend and I dined here last night and absolutely loved it
First of all, the service was awesome - our waitress took the time to make reccomendations, ask us about our tastes - and even dissuaded us from a couple of dishes
At no point was she hurried or annoyed, like the service at all those cramped East Village haunts
Even the bread and butter was spectacular
Hamachi ceviche: delicious
Seafood stew: amazing
Steak: most tender meat we've had in a long time
Best mojito I've ever had - and I've had my share
can't wait to go back!
Lucy Latin Kitchen is my new favorite wind-down spot
First of all the food is magnificent, the cocktails are delicious-i particularly looove the mojitos
The combination of vibrant and festive decor and the eclectic latin music provides the perfect atmoshere for an after work drink, a romantic date ,or a group dinner
First time I went to Lucy, my boyfriend took me for a romantic dinner on a weekday
It was perfect! We could hold a conversation without having to shout, the service was extra attentive, and the food was out of this world! I thought they were very creative and never compromised the flavors in doing so, the presentation was impeccable, and the wine list was outstanding
I went back on a weekend with a group of friends, and once again, everything was above and beyond my expectations
I even had the Sangria, which I don't normally drink but was pursued to because of an article I read in the Voice about Lucy's sangria and loved it! I've even made it my Sunday spot (they have the most incredible band in the city playing great Latin music)
I wonder if they have some sort of membership I could apply for
The food, decor, and ambience exceeded my expectations
I had dinner with a group of 3 and the service was great
The wait was worth the food for it tasted as good as it looked
The service was superb as the waitress was very attentive
From the appetizers, entrees, and dessert
it was delicious
I highly recommend this place to those interested in Latin American food with a contemporary touch
The restaurant is very trendy and the atmosphere was laid back
The sangria is a must have!!!
I went to Lucy's and is a very fun and good place to go, the people are very nice and it has a great atmosphere

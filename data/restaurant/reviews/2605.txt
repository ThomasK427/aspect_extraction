it was about $5 for this
what a joke!!!
I waited for an HOUR for a tuna tartar and a miso soup to be delivered to my place which is only a few blocks away
How long does it take to prepare a raw fish?? It cost me $17 for the luke warm miso soup and the soggy fish
NOT WORTH IT! I don't know why this place even offers delivery if they can't do it
It was great
The food was great, very nice portions - the sashimi 'melted in your mouth
Try the tuna it was the freshest I had ever tasted
The owner came by several times to talk and offered us milky sake which was the perfect ending to the meal
We are definitely going back again and recommend it to anyone who loves sushi
Great food, consistent service, and a very committed owner/manager
Try the white tuna and toro as both are high quality for the price
Also, the milky sake is a cool way to finish up dinner
My friend and I stumbled upon this hidden gem after a rough workout one evening last week
We couldn't have been more pleased with the service (prompt and attentive), the food (really really yummy), or the selection (plenty of rolls and other entrees to choose from)
The owner came by and talked to us as well
He is very very friendly
My girlfriend and I entered the restaurant just before closing
We were literally the last people served
The place was small but comfortable
We ordered 5 different sushi rolls and they were all delicious
The fish tasted very fresh and the presentation was nice
We also had a chance to talk with the owner
He approached us and was extremely friendly
I highly recommend this place for anybody in the mood for sushi
As someone who loves the city as much as sushi, this find was wonderful! The quaint atmosphere was perfect for couples, no loud chatter or music
Its great for before a show- the location is perfect, the service is quick yet you don't feel ignored
Very friendly staff who are helpful with the menu and reservations
They knew we were going to a 8:00 show and our 6:30 reservation was perfect gave us plenty of time to get to our theatre
I took my family to New York the day after New Years'
The storm of the previous day's crowds was settling
Times Square was still pretty electric
We spent the whole day exploring The Lower East side, China Town, Grand Central, Strawberry Fields, and more
It was 8:00 PM on Monday and beginning to rain as our weary party of six happened into Raku on 47th street
It was warm, friendly, comparatively quiet, unhurried, comfortable, and the most delicious sushi any of us had ever experienced
So fresh!
Looking for great sushi and real fresh? This is the place for you
Just fab
I don't need overpriced atmosphere with average sushi
if that is what you want go somewhere else
If you appreciate fresh and good imagination Raku is it
The rolls are very unique and the white tuna is excellent
The white sake is sooooo good
Thanks Ray!!! your the best! This is my new fav sushi joint, and I am very picky
Looking to get my name on that board
Keep rockin on Ray!
Tried Raku for the first time because we were in the neighborhood
Not a good idea
We received one menu and had to ask several times for the second
The sushi/sashimi combo was mediocre in quality and overpriced for the amount of fish on the plate
Once the food came, we could not eat because we did not have the little plates for the soy sauce
Finally, after trying several times to get a waiter to the table, we had to go obtain the soy plates ourselves!  Though the staff was so apologetic about this, it was a shame they were so unorganized
It was also a shame that I had premade deli sushi the other day that was of better quality then Raku's
Anyone looking for a nice relaxed atmosphere with incredible, fresh sushi with choices for all? The type of place that you start eating your fresh melt in your mouth sushi and you realize that your closing the place
Thats what I like to find here in the city
I love to find the place that you can call home, right next the the deli that makes your favorite coffee
They offer unique varieties of rolls and interesting mix of flavors
White sushi anyone? Order up
Thanks Ray for the fab milky sake that must be ordered upon visiting
My new fav sushi spot!
The sushi at this place is amazing
You will be one happy customer when you leave
The sushi is so fresh and the exotic rolls are delicious
I definately recommend this place
The sake is great too
I'm a Japanese from LA, CA
My friend and I were in NYC for business, and we both were pretty stressed out and also sick
All we wanted was good food near the hotel
I've heard about this place before but their website and many ratings somehow made me wondered if they're too good to be true and I didn't go there last year
The place was smaller than I thought, and a waitress was not really friendly
But one of the waiters was really helpful and friendly (later we found out that he was the owner)
The sushi was very fresh and the price was reasonable
We ordered Mango Ray (Wht tuna Mango roll) and it was melting on our tongues! I will definitely go back when I'm in NYC again
Thank you, Ray!
i tried this place based on the reviews and i certainly wasn't disappointed but pleasantly surprised
raku's decor certainly doesn't compare to nobu (cracks me up that people are judging a restaurant on its looks rather than its food!) but the quality of sushi here totally does! the creative rolls: ray mango roll, black dragon roll were to die for
it's a cozy place, which is how i like to enjoy my meals, with good friends good food
Like others on this site, I was fooled by the rave reviews
I have been to many Japanese places in the city and this one is average, at best
If you want a romantic dinnner, skip this place
Yes, the service was fine and friendly but not good enough to explain the sub par sushi and ambience
Honestly, this place does not stand out so I don't get the number of reviews they have on citysearch
To me, it looks like a ploy by the owners to generate business
If you want average sushi, come here, if you want better sushi, go to Haru, Tomoe, Yama or Nobu
This might not be the fanciest of all sushi restaurants but it's definitely the one with the most intimate setting
For two people, one of which likes sushi and the other doesn't, it was great
Great sushi and great prices!! Will definitely go back the next time we're in the city
I went to this restaurant based on the number of positive reviews on citysearch
Boy, lesson learned
I was somewhat skeptical at first about the 9
6 rating RAKU received, but the reviews convinced me to give it a try
What a mistake, the restaurant deserves a 5 at best, in my opinion
I would not give this restaurant a second chance no matter how good the reviews are
This is a great little sushi place located on 47th street near Times Square
The sushi was excellentas was the Plum Wine and Sake
After dinner and even a few times during the owner came upto us and asked us how we felt about the place and the food which doesn't happen often in Manhattan
The tables were very small(as can be expected in Manhattan) but not much smaller than the Midtown Sushi Samba
I found this Gem of a restaurant in the AAA book for NYC
I was impressed, very large menu of selections at fair prices for NYC
The Fruit Sake was incredible, a must try in-between different courses or different selections of sushi

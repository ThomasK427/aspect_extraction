So, make sure you allow some extra wait time if you go in the evening
While the prices of dishes are OK, the salads, deserts and coffee are expensive
So, get ready for $70-75 bill for a diner for 2 at the end not including tips
Quality food with a diverse menu, along with great service and a subtlely refined setting
You cannot go wrong here
My fiance proposed to me at ViceVersa
We had a wonderful table towards the back
The service was impeccable and the food was supposedly fantastic, although I was so taken off guard when he asked me to marry him that I couldn't eat once the meal came
He enjoyed every bite of it though
the waiters brought champagne and dessert to help us celebrate our night! I'll never forget it
Love it! There isn't one negative thing I could say about this restaurant
I have been there several times and it never disappoints
A great date restaurant, intimate with a lovely garden
Ranks very high on my list for favorite Italian places
Nice garden, good service and if you have an 8PM curtain call they will get you there on time
What a delightful restaurant! From the lovely understated neutral decor to the amazingly friendly staff this is a restaurant to recommend to friends or visitors to Manhattan
All this would be wasted if the food was average, but in my six week stay in the East, this restaurant served the finest food of any I visited
If you are a real foody, the menu is outstanding and ingredients the freshest
Try the veal with tuna sauce and caperberry appetizer - creamy sauce with melt in your mouth veal
The gnocchi - soft little pillows obviously made with respect for the ingredients
Finished with the best custard (pistacchio) I have eaten ever, anywhere
After that, I was served gratis a wonderful plate of home made biscotti and cookies to have with my coffee
This amazing meal, with a fine glass of chianti, was only $43
Go - enjoy - ViceVersa!
I can't say enough good about VV
Whenever I am in NYC, VV is top on my list of restaurants to visit!  STAFF: Everyone from the owners to the bus staff treats you as though you are their only customer, without being intrusive or stuffy
Smiles and humor are a constant commodity!  SERVICE: Your water glass will never run dry and if you leave the table momentarily, when you return, your napkin will have been refolded! EVERYone knows the ingredients of the meals and how they're prepared
If you ask about personal favorites, you're told about two items from each category so that you can decide what sounds best to you!  FOOD: You won't be disappointed with any of the reasonably priced entress
And, after a few visits, you'll be choosing your own favorites that will keep you going back to VV!!!  ENJOY!!!
My 13 year old daughter wanted to have her birthday party in NYC - a nice lunch and shopping with 8 friends
We arrived about 15 minutes late for a Friday 12:30 reservation, but the staff couldn't have been nicer
Were given a lovely table overlooking the garden
Ordered the veal-filled pasta and risotto, both were great
The kids ordered the meat sauce, and tomato and basil pastas, and seafood ravioli and split orders Also got the calamari, which everyone enjoyed
It's mis-represented as a salad, more like a fritata
Since we wanted to get dessert later, I asked the waiter to bring one bowl of ice cream so that we could sing Happy Birthday
The ice cream came complete with candle, and 'Happy Birthday' writtten in powdered sugar, and complemenary biscotti which were wonderful
I would definitely recommend ViceVersa, and will be back
Yesterday, I went to the 1050 (to the lounge, which is next to the restaurant) with my boyfriend and we had a great time
They had the BEST Apple Martini that I ever tried, and trust me I have been trying to find a good Apple Mar
for a while now
Also, the service was great, everyone is friendly and it is not loud, so you can actually talk
If you come early (around 8pm) you will not see many people there
Great value for the money: Apts
for about $6-12 and Drinks are cheap $7-9
Go, and check it out
I tried this place a few times
Their service seem to get worst each time I went
The service was slow and their waiters seem to ignore you
The food was average at best
Their dishes were dirty the first two times I went

Ended up at this 9th ave thai and was impressed with the thai style (chopped) basil beef
Have had it in dozens of places and this was at the top
The green curry is also right up there as well
If you are looking for Thai in nyc
you will not regret chowing down here
This place is the best and so cheap, plus they will make the food thai spicy if you ask them
Great for vegetarians too! It's small inside but you can always take it to go
This shoebox of a restaurant churns out authentic Thai dishes at reasonable prices
It's a simple joint with great food - need I say more? I like the Yum Woon Sen (spicy glass noodles) and Lemon Grass Chicken amongst other dishes like Pad Thai and Fried Rice
If you need some greens the watercress is good cooked slightly spicy (Thai style)
I frequent the original Wondee located East side of 9th and enjoy the casual neighborhood setting
Plain little restaurnat with delicious food! Yum!
Definitely one of the best Thai places around New York! 'Nuff said!  Anyhow, for more seating space with a newer environment Wondee Siam II just across the street from Wondee Siam is probably better
The food at II was initially more Americanized but I think it's changed with customer feedback from fans of the original (which is unfortunately extremely small and cramped)
To make sure you're getting authentic Thai-style dishes (which is spicier), simply tell the waiter at Wondee Siam II! That's what the boss lady told us to do when we informed her we still preferred the smaller joint's cooking and we've had great Thai there ever since
Everything's good!
I've only been to Wondee Siam 2
Not a great atmosphere, but the food makes you overlook that, even forget about it
Best, cheapest thai I've had
Try the thai tea and green curry- wonderful
or to sit down, if you don't care about being cramped into some fairly spartan surroundings
Good-sized portions and very good prices are a great start, but the excellent food seals the deal
Highlights: Red Curry, Pad Thai
Only disappointment is that you have to beg and plead to get them to make the food hot beyond a token tang, and even then, they're hesitant to provide that heat that real Thai food is supposed to have
One other thing to remember: there are two wondee siam's within two blocks of each other on 9th Avenue
GO TO WONDEE SIAM II, wihich is the northernmost of the two (54th, I think)
Most items are about a dollar more expensive, but you can taste the difference
My overall grade of a 10 pertains to takeout at Wondee Siam II
By far, the best Thai restaurant in the city
Add to that fact, it's dirt cheap
Who needs ambiance with a deal like this? Take it for what it is and ENJOY!
Food was good but their service was awful
Chilli sauce I asked had insects inside
I asked for replace but waitresses ignored never bothered to bring another one
Because of their rudeness, I gave them a small tip
One waitress even came after us to the street told us she doesn't want that kind of tip
If she wants to get good tip, she should treat her customers better
In Short Located inside the Essex House hotel, this expansive restaurant features big, well-spaced tables, bounteous floral arrangements, abundant brass fittings and giant oil paintings
On one side of the room, a waterfall gurgles away happily, and Central Park is visible through the windows
Brunch is a buffet-style affair, with a cornucopia of food spread out across the room, including a dessert table
Stuffy is not the word for this place! Went here for my 31st birthday on my first trip to NY
I was extremely disappointed
Uptight servers and bad table when we had booked in advance
Our table was right beside the waiters clean up area
The food was only so so
I had a much better meal at Etoile the night before! I will although give them this, they do have a beautiful atmosphere
The hostess was also extremely helpful and delightful to talk to
Real stuffy and overpriced

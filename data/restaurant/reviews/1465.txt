I got a margarita, frozen with salt
again
okay
It was served in a tumbler, which is weird
I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that does not serve frozens in a pretty little mararita glass
Then dinner - Fajitas
way bland with only one greasy, stuck to the napkin tortilla
And everything was lukewarm
I hate giving bad reviews, but I would not want others to waste their time or money
I have to believe there are better places to drop some hard earned cash with a better return!
This is my favorite restaurant - they have great drinks (the margaritas are awesome - my friend and I love the raspberry and guava flavors - but they also have specialty drinks and sangria
The sangria is not the best but otherwise the drinks are fantastic
The food is also quite good - the soft seafood taco, empanadas and lamb pozoles (a corn based stew) are exceptional
However, what keeps me coming back time after time is the staff - they are friendly and fun
It is surprising to see negative reviews on the courteousness of the staff
I have never been there on Saturday night and the one Friday night I went was extremely busy but the staff was always very interactive and amiable
I typically go some time during the week (in the evenings from Sunday through Thursday) and have had an amazing time
Although small (4 seats) the bar area is also nice to seat at and chat with the bartender and you may also eat at the bar
Overall, I highly recommend El Centro - go in and enjoy yourself and I am sure you will have great food, drinks, service and conversation!
I think it is a testement to New Yorkers that most reviews of most restaurants on most websites in NYC are negative
People judge based on expectations not actual experience
And everyone always says the service is slow or rude or something
El Centro is bright and loud but being a huge fan of Mexican food and having spent years in Mexico (Baja and Oaxaca) I would say that the food is the most authentic I've had in NYC
If you are served cold food - send it back
If you are in a hurry - tell your server
In Mexico all service is slow - they don't come to your table unless you ask them too because they consider it rude to interrupt or hurry you away
It's a cheap restaurant, but not in the good way
The owners are cheap
You start with a basket of tortilla chips and a dish of salsa so small that you actually have trouble dipping your chips into it
Don't bother asking for another, El Centro seems to be the only Mexican restaurant in NYC that actually charges for extra baskets of chips, $3
00 a pop
The bill was $45
52, I handed the server $60
52 and wanted change, she handed back the $
52 and said they don't take change(coins), we just round it
Our change comes and there is only $14
00, not $14
48
El Centro seems to think that they have the right to keep money that's not theirs
I'm not saying that the $
48 is going to ruin my night, but it's the principal
Bottom line is El Centro's a cheap restauraunt and I do not recommend going there
I couldn't wait for El Centro to open but when my boyfriend and I tried it we were very disappointed
The service was very slow and the food was below par
The only good thing was the Sangria
There is much better Mexican not only in the city but in this neighborhood as well
I was pretty impressed by this place
The atmosphere was great -- bright, Oaxacan colors and decorations throughout
The food was really good too; authentic mexican flavors instead of your standard soft taco and taquito plate
It's a little small though, so better for a group of 2 instead of a group of 6
Bland, cold food
Poor, slow service
Cramped, tight seating
Blecch
As a fan of Mexico- El Centro leaves much to be desired
The service was really slow- the food was relatively bland and, beyond that, cold
No one wants cold mole sauce over a cold tortilla and lukewarm steak- which is exactly what El Centro served me
ate there last night
delicious
tacos, tostadas, and pozoles all delicious
would not recommend the mole
otherwise everything was amazing
will be back
I took my roommate here for her birthday dinner despite reading some of the unfavorable reviews posted
The atmosphere was really great, the garden is lovely and the service was excellent
We had a lot of questions and our waitress was extremely helpful and patient
However I was just not impressed with the food
Perhaps it is just that I do not like Morrocan cuisine, but I found my cous cous and vegetables to be extremely bland and definitely not worth the amount of money I paid for it
My roommate felt the same way about her gyro platter
The table next to us had hummus which looked delicious, so we really should have stuck to appetizers and wine
I do not think I will be going back
My roommate and I went here for some after-work sangria
Not only was the sangria great, but so were our appetizers
Service might've been better than usual because there weren't too many people there, but the dcor was lovely and the food was quite good
It's no wonder the service here is terrible and the the food tastes like crap
No self-respecting restuarant-industry person would ever work for the nutjobs who run this place
They should be locked inside a mental institution instead of pathetically attempting to run a customer-service oriented business
I can't even begin to explain how utterly miserable they made our dining experience, which to top off consisted of appetitizers that tasted like the kind you buy frozen at Jack's 99 cent store and a kabob plate with lighter-fluid/charcoal flavored chicken - and that was the most flavorful part of the dish
Our other dish was a couscous dish that was basically unedible
What a disappointing addition to a friendly east village block
We were seated for over 45 minutes before anyone on staff aknowledged our existence long enough to bring us water (to be fair, the waiter was quite nice and apologetic -- clearly twisting under the boot of failed leadership)
The most significant recognition came from the head chef, who, after exploding at a cook for the chef's own apparent error, approached our table to complain to us about the difficulty of working with dummies
He then descended to the basement, from where his continued chastisement of his staff was audible to all above ground
Compound this lousy service with a belligerent manager and a convoluted and expensive service charge for BYOB ($15 per person, when the menu clearly stated a $10 charge per bottle!!), and you've got one of the worst dining experiences your hard-earned money can buy
A dud
If you want a dining experience that includes: - Change your order because your food is not fresh (after you have been waiting for it for 45 minutes)
- See half of the table eating and the other half thinking of ordering a pizza because the food is not coming
- Being insulted from the chef while the manager is having fun with his friends instead of takin' care of business
- Seeing the same chef umiliate the waitress (actually the only person in there that really belongs to the restaurant business) in front of the costumers (Man: you are not even man enough to take responsability for your own mistakes and you need a woman to take the fall for you!!!!!!!)
- Have your friend's Birthday Party ruined because of somebody whom shouldn't even be allowed to step into a restaurant
WELL!!!! EL DAR IS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!! GOOD LUCK!!!!!
I've lived in the East Village for ten years and have seen this spot occupied by many restaurants
With a little luck, Al-Dar will soon join the club of exes
In a nutshell: the owner is rude, the service is slow, the food is terrible and overpriced ($11 entree consisting of four tiny dumplings resembling frozen pizza pockets)
The owners don't seem the least bit preoccupied with whether their patrons are content
We saw the female manager (owner?) snap at several bewildered customers, and everyone waited an eternity for their food to arrive
When the bill came, we were a few cents short of the $15 (per person) minimum to avoid paying the $10 fee for bringing in our own bottle of wine (which we were encouraged to go buy -- with no mention at the time of any cork fee
), but they wouldn't waive the fee
Bizarre
NEVER AGAIN

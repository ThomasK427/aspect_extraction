i know i will be back for more
they also have a great wine list for the conessiur
I love this place
It's the best when you don't want to cook, but you want something hearty and wholesome
Great meatballs, best gnocci, ever-changing wine list, staff that knows about the wine and the food
It's great in the summer when you can sit outside but not be on a crowded street
I had been excited to try Frankies for some time and almost didn't after reading some of the reviews here
What a mistake that would have been! Our whole experience was excellent - from being greeted at the door, to our friendly and efficient service and most importantly, absolutely delicious meal
I highly recommend - it's our new favorite for Italian
I eat at Frankie's at least once a week
And I have never been disappointed
Try the sandwiches: eggplant marinara or sopreseta and parmesan
They are amazing and, at $7
00, very reasonably priced
I was very excited to this addition to the neighborhood
The atmosphere is wonderful, but it ends right there
The food is nothing special, and the whole concept is nothing like an experience in Italy
The waiters are terribly slow and aloof
It takes pretentious to a new level
The only substance here is the espresso, but that can be had 1\2 block down the street
People who say it's affordable were not hungry when they walked in the door
I've given it 3 times because I really wanted to like it, but it is not worth the aggravation
I live nearby and have been a repeat customer at Frankie's
I was surprised to read all of the negative reviews, and although some must have merit, they outnumber the positive ones and that's just not right
I've never had bad service at Frankie's and in fact our servers have always been polite, friendly and on the ball
The portions are not supersized but this isn't fast food, people
Prices are average for New York and the quality is superb
Recommended!
Horrible service, called the day before to ask for a reservation they told me that they don't do reservations - fine
Got there the next day waited for an hour and they gave our table to another party of 6 that got there after us because they called the same day and they told them that they were going to SAVE the table for them
Pathetic! We were not offered water or bread the entire time were waiting
I'm telling all my friends not to ever go there
Long waits and terrible service! Our meals were messed up and we ended up waiting for another hour for our food
I do not recommend this place
My boyfriend and I were thrilled to try Frankie's last weekend, but alas left dazed and confused
It seemed very promising - great bartender service and vibe
But the menu? Come on! PLEASE don't make me work at trying to decipher what cute and ingenious idea went behind this mess
Frankie's should have set up shop in the LES where the hipsters don't know any better
You want good Italian food in Carroll Gardens keep on walking down Court Street
Since I moved to the sleepy end of Court St
from Cobble Hill, I have been jonesing for something like this to come along
It's two blocks away from where I live and I really want to like it
I have given it two chances and have both times been disappointed
I have since read the blurbs in TONY and NYMAG and have even had people who live in Manhattan ask me if I have been there
The owner is pretty cute - and my guess is that he knows people
PR people
They absolutely don't live up to their hype
The prices are reasonable - if you aren't hungry and don't mind your $8-10 plates coming with two bites on it
The service is bad too - waitstaff is forgetful and seems to be doing you a favor
What a shame
It's a beautiful room
I was pretty skeptical when my friends wanted me to come all the way to the end of Court Street to some Italian joint I had never heard of, but it really paid off
Yeah it was a busy Saturday night and we had to wait but we got some super tasty drinks from the bar and passed the time scoping out the cute waiters
They even told us we could go the bar across the street and chill out and they'd call us when our table was ready
Anyway, once we got our table, the food came pretty fast and it was AMAZING
Everything was so good
I had a salad and the Cavatelli
The salad was good but the Cavatelli was insane
Hand made pasta nuggets with butter, sage and sausage
Mamma Mia! I'll be back
This place was a great addition to a slow end of Court
It's great for a nice meal and drinks close to home
Everything they do is good
the wine selections
cheese plates
meals
Welcome and congrats
if you live nearby GO, if not travel to try it
My husband and I LOVE Frankies!! We have been in a handful of times since they opened and every time we go we are so glad we did
The food is wonderful, the atmosphere is cozy and the service is unpretentious and genuine
Whether we go in for a snack on our own or with a group of friends, we always have a great time
The gnocchi is AMAZING and they have the best bread and olive oil anywhere
The wines by the glass (at least 10) are well selected and you are going to find something that suits you, no matter what mood you are in
The desserts are DELICIOUS, especially the prunes
Try Frankies, especially if you are in the neighborhood, you will be back!
Had dinner here the on 11/29 after all of the recent buzz
As soon as we were seated, the waiter comes by to get our order
We asked for a minute or two the guy just forgot about us
Another waiter filled in for him 10 minutes later when he realized his mistake
After we waited nearly 25 minutes for our food (the place wasnt crowded), our waiter forgot some of our order and brought out a salad when we asked for everything to come out all at once
The crostini was mediocre at best
the roasted eggplant was served cold the tomoto anchovy one had no taste
The cheese plate sausage sandwich was merely tolerable
The wine was good, the place was warm comforting but Frankie's is seriously overrated
They wish they were as good as Ino
Sunny, Sunday, Backyard Brunch are four words that set a week in perfect motion when strung together well, but for the single girl, wandering into a sea of Sunday couples can be hell
Frankies is a very comfortable place to hang solo, despite the tables graced with happy couples and the bar draped with blond babes
As for the food, the roasted vegetable Frittata was sweet and plump
The double cappuccino, perfect and strong, just like mama used to make
Nighttime is when the joint really sings
Bring friends and share plates
The austere backyard is cozy and nicely lit; the Barbera is plummy and reasonably priced
Try the Mushroom risotto (amazing), and Frankies meatballs (Frankies meatballs are the best)
The hazelnut mousse is not to be missed, and the warm prunes in fig sauce are surprisingly sexy
Best of all, check out the cute and friendly chefs
Check out this outstanding spuntino (Italian snacks) that you can make a great meal out of and enjoy there service and atmosphere
You can tell the owners are passionate about food and ambiance
Look out back at the garden and you will be amazed at how big it is

The only disappointment was the grilled salmon was a little over cooked other than that everything was great!
My girlfriend and I love this place
This place is only a few minute away from our house and we visit it for brunch almost every weekend
This place is small, cozy, and every customer gets a personal service
The portions are just right and are always finger-licking good
If you are in the area, stop by - you won't be dissapointed
Because of a dearth of nice restaurants in our immediate area of Clinton Hill, when Kush opened up my friends and I ate there as often as we could afford
We wanted it to stay in our neighborhood!!! A year later, thankfully, it is only going strong
The food is wonderful and very affordable
Kush is self described as Pan African and their entrees really reflect it
Many exotic dishes served up elegantly
And the service is always friendly, it is simply a charming place to spend an evening
The downside is that the space is small although, it is beautifully decorated and I have yet had the problem of getting a seat there
Dont pass this one!
The latest hot spot in Brooklyn
If you live in the Clinton Hill/Fort Green or BedStuy area, it's a wonderful to eat
The staff is extremely pleasant and the decor is pleasing to the eye
The walls remind you of the evening sun and the floors are the color of sand
Its like dining in a mini Sahara desert that's been turned into a restaurant
Better Burger is my favorite eatery for a guilt-free burger experience
My favorites are the chicken burger with marsala mushrooms, baked fries (they are amazing)and the caramel espresso smoothie
I like knowing that the meat is organic and/or naturally raised
It is the only place where I let my daughter eat a burger
Knowing that the food is both better for you and tastes good too, makes better burger a must eat here now place!
This place is good if you like burgers, but are trying to be healthy
It's a little expensive, but worth it
I recommend the ostrich burger
Tastes just like beef but better for you
And even though the fries aren't fried they're good and crunchy
Better Burger is my new favorite hangout in the uppereast
The food is great and the smoothies are refreshing
My favorite is the pomogranate apple
I also looooooove their soy burger with cheese and marsala mushrooms
The beef and chicken burgers are also juicy and delic! They just started an adorable kid's meal which is great for my friends with teeny toddlers
Though I love the idea of a healthier burger place, this one was a disappointment
I waited about 12 minutes for my food at lunchtime on a weekday, even though there was no line
When I got back to my office, the bun on my burger was soggy, saturated with burger juice and had become inedible
The fries had no flavor and were dry and not at all crispy
More like old potatoes baked in salt
For $8
15 (no drink), I expected a little more
The Scene Mod furniture and the clean lines of Nordic design make this venerable Scandinavian restaurant feel very 21st century, with dark wood tones lending the rooms warmth, and cherry blossoms in vases offering a minimalist frill
An upscale business crowd populates the dining room; more casual diners enjoy the cafe
The Food Chef Marcus Samuelsson's dishes pamper the palate from start to finish
The divine, fatty essence of foie gras ganache--cake with a gooey, duck liver center--combines wonderfully with its octopus and smoked trout companions; hot smoked arctic char picks up the sharpness of a green apple horseradish broth and the earthiness of black truffles and grilled asparagus; and a "lobster roll" features pristine shellfish neatly wrapped in a tart, paper-thin layer of green apple
And a mellow goat cheese parfait with blueberry sorbet leaves diners feeling like they've just experienced an exhilarating, culinary spa treatment
Went for restaurant week and learned it conitnues for dinner in the care year round- GREAT deal for the dollar- shrimp toast and meatballs were divine and the chocolate peanut tort is worth going back for alone! Get the wine pairing- it is worth it
Great polite service- v
friendly- we had a doozy of a table next to us and the waiter never lost his cool or kind attitude
I recently went here and was not impressed at all
I had such high hopes, considering the restaurant has topped MANY review lists but overall the food was bland and the service left a lot to be desired
The only good things were the aquavit flight and the cocktails
While I miss the fountain and space of the old restaurant, the new locations is still very elegant and the food rocks!
Best Sea Trout I have ever eaten
you will never go wrong taking someone there
We were so looking forward to our dinner at Aquavit after reading great reviews and jeez were we ever let down
Decor was nice, service was overbearing and food left a lot to be desired
Staff pushed the tasting menu insisting that if anyone at our table wanted to order it the whole table had to order it, an all or nothing deal
At least 3 times we were told we should all have the tastng menu
Food was very dissappointing, staff was constantly hoovering around table to tell us EVERY ingredient in every dish, service was SO SLOW a 4 hour meal
I enjoyed the old space and had some great meals there
In the new location the food is great and service friendly but clueless
Drinks to go with appetizers arrived with desert (though complimentary
), dirty plates sat on the table 10 or 15 minutes, and the maitre d's obsession with getting us to order pinot (he pitched it 4 times
) seemed bordering on deranged, as was his desire to describe every dish on the menu in minute detail (we read the menu thanks
)
Perhaps it is just teething problems but with a min $75 menu this should be right
It's a shame the restaurant no longer has a waterfall, but the decor is nice nonetheless
The service is also good, though a little off
The waiters have a bit of trouble with English and sometimes it takes a little time to get their attention
The bread is very nice as is the butter/goat cheese spread
The herring sampler leaves a lot to be desired
The taste of vinegar overpowers everything else
The hot smoked salmon entree on the other hand is original and very pleasant
The prix fixe lunch is a great deal
I went here for restaurant week and even though there was a $35 prix-fixe menu, the bill came to $120 for 2 with tax and tip
The service is superior here
The decor and ambiance was very special, as was the carefully chosen music, wine list and Aquavit-based cocktails, however, I wasn't terribly impressed by the food, which is supposed to be the main attraction when going to an expensive restaurant
I ordered the tomato soup with goat cheese (the soup was way too sweet but the generous portion of decadent goat cheese in the center almost made up for it) and the swedish meatballs (the meatballs were savory and delicious, but textbook
The mashed potatoes, though smooth and creamy, were an exercise in overseasoning, and were so salty and buttery they bordered on inedible
) The desserts were the highlight, and were surprisingly sublime
Had a great experience
Food was amazing, there was a party in my mouth after every course
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
Came here for a bday party on Friday night and I was so impressed
The place is visually arresting
So beautiful, so trendy and so laid-back
We parked in the garage around the corner and had the restaurant validate our ticket for free parking
Our party had a semi-private table which was perfect for our affair
The food was great and the live salsa band and DJ were awesome, not at all overwhelming
The place wasn't packed, but there was a bar scene and a few salsa dancers who strutted their stuff on the dancefloor
Its not a club though! I will definitely, definitely be back
Haven't been to a place this good in a while
Good food, drinks, live music and ambience!
The name is derived from the Polish word for Kitchen
For one thing the place is cozy and elegant with crystal chandeliers,silk pillows on the banquettes and French chanson on the sterio
For another the service is more than friendly The food from the kitchen has a flair that makes it not quite home cooking ,Take the Ukrainian Red Borscht whose hot dill-flecked beet broth contained not only still crunchy fresh beet slices but plump white beans ($4
50) We also had wild mushroom in a light cream sauce were spooned over crunchy toast (9
00) and we ended with the Beef Stroganoff lean and tender in a sour cream sauce , we had a great time we'll be back
Reading the previous reviews and reading their menu online, I was looking forward to checking out this restaurant

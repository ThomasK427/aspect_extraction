Carmine's is a nice little unpretentious place next to the fish market
It's decor is a bit shabby in an old seaport bar kinda place, but that only adds to the experience I think
They have incredible garlic bread, not on the menu, but try it! Although their pasta's are nothing special, they do very nice traditional chicken and seafood dishes
Slightly overpriced and a bit of a shocker if you judged this place by looks alone
I've never seen anyone sitting at their bar
Definately a hold-over from another era
Worth trying once, if you are in the area
Kid-friendly too
I've been going to Carmine's for years
My most recent visit made me wonder what happened to the Carmine's I knew? The food was not good at all
We had to send back our clam appetisers
The chicken parmesan was overcooked and tough
The lobster oreganato was dry
The garlic bread was bland
To add insult to injury, the waiter could care less
I've been going to Carmine's for over 10 years now and there is a reason I keep returning: Mussels Fra D'avalo! Order them along with a cold antipasto and a few Rolling Rocks and you can't go wrong
Many of the other dishes are hit and miss and everything is a little pricier than it should be
However, the people are always friendly and I really like the old school ambiance
A small, crowded place where you have to arrive early to get a table
Not fancy, but plenty of atmosphere in this Fulton Fish Market location
The food is delicious, the portions ample, and the prices reasonable
Mediocre, inexpensive wine list
Okay
First of all
They serve you food on plastic plates
And the silverware is plastic too
We had to find out the hard way
We weren't given any without first having to get up and walk over to the hostess and remind her that we couldn't eat their low grade, out of the box pasta without utensils
Fortunately, there is a nice view of downtown manhattan and the seaport from where we sat to distract us from the mediocre food and bad service
It's too bad they ended up overcharging (almost double) for a sticky, flavorless pasta alfredo w/chicken dish without realizing it
Its really too bad because different management could make much better use of that wonderful location
Come for drinks
Leave for real food
I love this place
the onion rings are greasy and they're the one's with minced pieces, probably from frozen
But if you like those kind they are so good!!!!!!!!!!! and being on the water makes it that much better! and the rare roast beef sandwich w/ cheese and I think pesto mayo is great! but it's big so you could share
and if you get a soda get it in the bottle w/ a cup of ice, so good
The Seaport in general is my favorite NYC place and the Seaport cafe one of my favorite restaurants!
to drop by to pick up something quick
They make a great chicken parm!
Ever need a pie at 8am? My Daddy's can do it
The only pizza joint downtown that opens early
And the pizza is great and trvels pretty well
The Scene Charles Gabriel's Harlem restaurant is tiny, and it certainly isn't glamorous--plastic tablecloths and a large television are among the most arresting features of the decor--but it's friendly, and the food's great
Once you bite into the succulent fried chicken, you'll realize that's all that matters
The Food Charles' offers two plans of attack: takeout and buffet
Main dishes for takeout consist of whatever Charles feels like making that day, but the fried chicken is legendary, as are oxtails
Other specialties include salmon cakes, liver and onions, smothered pork chops, baked bluefish as well as sides like macaroni and cheese, collard greens and okra and tomatoes
The all-you-can-eat buffet (available for lunch or dinner from Tuesday through Sunday) features many of the takeout choices plus dishes like stewed beef, supremely tender barbecue ribs and a perfect potato salad
If you enjoy stuffing your face with extreme comfort food Southern style, then this is the place for you
I admit, the location may not be for everyone being located so far up Harlem, but I assume thats part of its neighborhood charm
The place is incredibly small, so forget bringing huge groups of people here because they just don't have the room
Buffetwise, it mirrors the restaurant's simplicity and size in its limited items, but all are very good
The macaroni and cheese, oxtail, fried okra, sweet potatoes, potato salad, and the fried chicken is finger licking good
Their desserts are also very good, freshly prepared and always served in the most abundant style
Service has always been attentive and very friendly, makes you feel like you're no longer in Manhattan
And with all of that for only $12 on the weekend, its worth the trip when you're in the area
I must admit that the customer service at Charles' was quite friendly
Unfortunately the two sides I ordered from the take-out section were not at all impressive
The collards were not well seasoned and the macaroni had a brothy taste to them with no traces of seasoning to be found
It was so unforgettable that I doubt I will be giving them a second chance
I went to Charles country style just to get a quick meal nothing spectacular, i had never been there before that night about a month ago but now I am a regular whenever I am in the area
the ribs sing to you the collard greens always taste just like Charles just picked them
The staff is friendly sometimes I don't want to leave, i would just go there for the hospitality of the staff if i had to ( but I would grab some oxtails on my way out LMAO)
This is wonderfull place that you would surely make a regular spot
This place is great
This is true Down Home Cookin no frills
This is one of Harlems Best kept Secrets and I hope it stays that way
And the ambience fits the food no frills - Everyone is a member of the family when they come here
Go and Enjoy all that is right in Soul Food!!!!!!!
I am not one to normally wolf down my food, but that's exactly what I do here! Everything is SOOOO good, from the fried chicken, to the candied yams, to the collard greens
Someone mentioned that the ambiance at the buffet restaurant isn't that great
I'm not sure what they were looking for
Sure, it's not upscale by any means, but the warmth of the staff, and the laid-back attitude of all the patrons makes the ambiance terrific IMHO!
You have to appeciate this soul food haven
I recommend take out(the ambiance isn't much)
The food is delicious, the service friendly, and I'll come here over and over again for a tasty, filling, low cost meal
I was born and raised in the south
I have prepared and eaten southern meals every Sunday for the well over 40 years and it's a great feeling and a pleasure to find a restuarant to seve home cooked meals that taste as if you went into the kitchen yourself and prepared them yourself
Charles Southern Style Kitchen in a gem and a real deal in service, price, portions
I looooove this place, the food is great, the staff is friendly and the ambience transports you to the countryside of the Dominican Republic
You will not be disappointed, try their Pia Coladas, tostones or Mangu for a true caribbean experience
The restaurant is good for celebrations, management works well to have you enjoy your time and festive occassion
Enjoy!
Let me start out by saying the food is delicious
Definitely try the broiled pork
The restaurant is set up like a tiki hut complete with rickety chairs and attractive bartenders
Our waitress was a bit cold but she was still attentive and food came quickly
I had to stare out waitress down to get our check and also we were charge
50 cents per take out container
Overall a really good time
just make sure you finish what's on your plate
Everytime my friends come visit me from Boston we have one place to get the delicious chicarones de pollo - MIRAGE
It is well worth the trek trying to find it (thank you GPS software!)
We drove for almost an hour in the Bronx trying to find this place with little more to go on thatn the name and general area! The ambience is a little dated and gawdy but the food is worth it! Hearty beans, perfect rice and I wont talk about the chicken anymore!
I was excited to find this restaurant, but my delivery experiences with them have not been great
On more that one occasion, they just don't answer their phone
When they do answer and take your order, the delivery time on average has been about an hour
I'm always surprised when they don't answer their phone, you'd think they wouldn't want to turn away business
One time they just said, no, delivery is out for 10 minutes and hung up on me

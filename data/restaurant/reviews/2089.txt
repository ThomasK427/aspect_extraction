My date and I ordered a few apps and drinks
The waiter said, is that it? like he was offendend we were not spending abunch of cash
My date asked for him to leave the menu on the table, we may order more apps
You could cut the tension with a knife
We ate and got the heck outta there! Food good, waiter very stuckup
Great atmosphere
there is something unique and special about this cozy restaurant
i was there this week (for the fourth time) and ate the cod and frisee salad
my friend had the pork and the risotto, and everything was delicious
not only that but the service was great
everyone i bring here loves it, it's like a gem hidden away in the west villiage, i feel fortunate to have stumbled upon it, and i know i'll be back soon!
I take a lot of my foodie friends here (we went through culinary school together), as well as my out-of-town guests
The food isn't ostentatious, nor does it try too hard
It is just good cooking
period
The atmosphere can't be beat and, together with the service, you feel like you are a regular and are welcomed warmly
This is the kind of restaurant where you genuinely like the management and hope they continue to succeed at what they do, because they obviously care
It doesn't hurt that they donate a portion of their proceeds to philanthropy in New York
My husband found this place three years ago, and we've had our anniversary dinner there ever since
The service is spectacular and the food is superb
We've tried several of the dishes and have not been disappointed
Some of the other reviewers have had problems with the manager
don't let this dissuade you from trying The Place
You won't regret it
The atmosphere/ambience service was great
What a friendly staff
It is indeed cute romantic
Went after Valentine's Day it was still decorated w/ hearts balloons
The food was good, not great portions, but the price is right
The only problem I had was that the fireplace only had candles lit in it I had specifically asked for a fireplace, meaning a working one
I didn't see any others
I ahve been to The Place 4 times
Everytime was a great experience! Good service, good food! The Place is a darkly lit romantic setting
I have highly recommended this restaurant numerous times
Great for a first date!
This place is one of my new favorites
Arrived here on a Sat
night w/ a reservation and were seated right away
You feel like you're in a cavernous lair in this almost underground locale
Service was top notch and the food was even better - my pork tenderloin was perfectly prepared with amazing seasonings and my friends were raving about the cod
This is a great place to take a special someone, or anyone who enjoys quaint, romantic places with delicious food
Perfect location in the Village too with so many great places nearby for after dinner
We will definitely be back
Went here on a dinner date last weekend
The host greeted us with such aplomb and humor that we felt immediately relaxed and ready for a romantic evening
The servers are very attentive but not hovering over you
Ella Fitzgerald was crooning in the background
My date ordered the steak which was excellent and not too heavy
I ordered the skatefish which was a bit salty for my liking and kind of reminded me of Mcdonald's filet-o-fish
But the ambience and neighborhood are so charming that its definitely a place you would take your special someone
My girlfriend and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary at The Place - we walked in and were seated promptly
The setting was quiet and romantic, the food was well presented, and the drinks put us at ease
The waiter was very friendly and hospitable as well
We shared a couple of appetizers (scallops grilled calamari) and 1 main course (steak), followed by a desert
In the end, we felt so welcome that we didn't want to leave
All in all, we are very happy with our choice to eat here
For lunch, he took me on a picnic in Central Park
For dessert, he pulled out a diamond ring and proposed
And for dinner, he took me to The Place
It was a perfect intimate hideaway-- an ideal spot to enjoy our secret before sharing the news with the world
The space is very small (25 tables, I believe) and some rather close together
The room feels rather like a cave
mysterious, hidden, and dimly lit
The food was wonderful, though the evening is, in all honesty a bit of a blur
I do recall that there was a nice wine selection and that the staff was attentive
We have been dining at the restaurant regularly for the past 6 years, the food is always great - the service outstanding, and the management always hospitable
We have had many memorable evenings here
The Place also donates 10% of its profits to charity
-Well done!
I had made a reservation the place several months ahead of time because of the good reviews
That day, we received a voice mail from the owner sometime before our reservation telling us to call if we needed to cancel because of rain
When we arrived, we were told the kitchen was closed
Needless to say, we were quite disappointed as we had a reservation
We didn't get an apology but were instead told by the manager thats what cell phones are for even though the message said only to call if we needed to cancel
I don't know how the ambience is one you are inside because we never made it
Any self-respecting New York restaurant would never provide such service and give us such a runaround
Don't waste your time on the place
I have been frequenting this place now for 2yrs and find it every time to be a great dining experience
The host is always gracious
They always finds us a place to sit quickly and are very attentive
Food is solid atmosphere is solid in the best area of the city
First Place go here for dinner especially if you want to impress a romantic
,
I took my girlfriend to The Place for Valentines Day and it was awesome
Thanks to some other reviewers i asked for the corner booth and it did NOT disappoint
They had rowed the ceiling with heart shape ballons, candles flickering, quiet atmosphere- the vibe was A+ romantic
The food was great and the service was impressive
I was going to take her to a real expensive ritzy place, im glad i didnt
I highly recommend this spot for any romantic evening
The food is excellent and the ambience is wonderful
It gets a bit crowded and it's a small restaurant, but that is what also makes it intimate
The staff is friendly and it's a perfect neighborhood restaurant
Not trendy or hip, just always superb
I've been to The Place many times
Made a reservation for a Saturday night and had to cancel that day
and I was scolded like a 4 year old! That's never happened to me!
I was so impressed with The Place
It seems like you are in another world down there
We stayed for a long dinner and were never rushed to leave
The menu items were great, although I think we liked our appetizers better than our entrees which were still good

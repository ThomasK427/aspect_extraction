Went for breakfast also recently, better for dinner
Enjoy!
What a shame the food is so very mediocre
It's location and feel had me so excited
But after two very disappointing eating experiences, I won't be going back
This is one of my favourite brunch spots!Brunch starts off with complimentary homemade corn bread,which is absolutely lovely
I recommend the cinnamon raisin french toast with strawberries and caramel sauce
the wait wasnt too long
20 minutes
which is pretty standard for most sunday brunch places in new york
meal prices are very decent too
the wait staff are pretty friendly
the atmosphere is very rustic and romantic with wooden floors and a fireplace
highly recommended!
love
love
loooove this place! It's on a beautiful tree-lined street in the Gramercy area
The wait for brunch is on avg
20-30 minutes/weekends
but oh so worth it! Their pumpkin waffles are fabolicious and the omelettes are heavenly! The hot dishes are served in a cast-iron frying pan with a side of friendliness from the waitstaff
And, although a lil' tight, the atmosphere is just so cozy
I've been to Paris Commune, Norma's, Sarabeth's, etc

this is by far my fav!
I went to this restaurant for the first time last weekend
It was the best brunch I have ever had! The service was wonderful - the wait-staff delightful and accomodating
I recommend the mimosa with poached eggs, toast and bacon to accompany the sassy smiles of the hosts
You will go crazy over the homemade breads that grace every table
My meal was absolutely scrumptious
and I must say the same for the manager's son who escorted me to my table!!! A must eat! PK Darringer
Ive eaten here a couple of times for dinner on Friday nights
When you walk in this restaurant for the first time, you would notice the overall simplicity of the place
Other guests might even say the restaurant in general is unattractive
Once seated inside, the service is excellent and the wait staff is courteous
The food varies from dish to dish but would range from okay to good
The Thai iced tea is good and the wine list is short but inexpensive
If you are looking for a not-so-crowded restaurant on a Friday night and good Thai food, I would suggest this place
There is certainly a standard here, I can tell
Not like Thai food at Bangkok House, it was totally opposited
It is a good Thai food here
I and my dining partner were very much enjoy the food here
I have been eating in this restaurant for years and loving it
However i went in there a couple of weeks ago and there was not one familiar face - i was told everyone went on vacation
I guess i should have walked out right there and then becaue that definitely strained the credibility of any sane person
But i stayed and ordered my favorite dishes - and unlike the 20 or 30 times i've eaten ther before, they were awful
Greasy, overcooked - one was burned
one was just inedible - the first time in my entire life I ever sent a dish back to the kitchen (and they still charged me for it)
They probably sole the place and no one is admitting it because a great restaurant cant go this bad this fast
I am so disappointed
Food was decent, but I would definitely recommend the Bayard branch in Chinatown
Do not order the mussels
Soup base was great, but the mussels must've been frozen for a while
it was too rubbery to be eaten
Mussels that unfresh should not have been served
Again, check out the Chinatown branch instead!
This is, without a doubt, the best Thai in the neighborhood (Stuyvesant, Gramercy, Murray Hill)
Authentic food at a good price
I usually take out, and pay $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner
Be careful when upgrading the heat, these people know their peppers/spice
Fast service and everyone is always nice
Highly reccomended
I actually like the Pong Sri in Chinatown and the one in the theater district
But this one
our food just was too greasy and didnt taste anything like the dish should
Go to the other 2
they are better
The food was far too bland and sometimes too sweet
If I specify spicy or extra-spicy, I expect to taste flavor
For NYC, this place is cheap, but I've actually had much better Thai food in Brooklyn
If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive and low-key Thai place this is a good spot
The food is authentic (read: Not Americanized) although the heat factor is kept to a range American palates can handle (a good thing)
And yes, I've been to Thailand several times and have eaten real Thai food just in case you've read other reviews saying only those who know nothing of real Thai food could rate this restaurant highly
Again, it's low-key but service was good
It's a simple place with a simple menu
Fortunately it's also simply delicious!
Alas, most people who gave this reastaurant high ratings must be out-of-towners who've never eaten anything exotic; and thus have no reference point as to what Thai food is supposed to taste like
The food was bland, even when asked for spicy
The meats were a bit off, probably not too fresh (both at this and the uptown location), one of the soups much too sweet, etc
Service, nothing special
Had a pleasant lunch there with a group of 6
The Service was en pointe and I felt like the servers were always aware of our wants, whether it was punctual refill of water, new napkins, etc
The thai Ice tea was great and the large noodle dishes like the radnar was delicious
The curry dishes were your standard thai cuisine
Overall, good buy and good eats
Possibly the best Thai in NYC (and I lived in Bangkok for 8 months)
Everyone I've ever taken here has loved the place
Great for vegetarians and meat eaters alike
Som tam (papaya salad) is tasty
Tom ka (coconut milk soup) can be made vegetarian upon request and it fantastic with just a bit of hot chili oil to give it a nice kick
All the vegetarian options are highly recommended but especially the tao hoo gra prow (spicy basil tofu)
Every visit I make to Pongsri in 2nd avenue the prices seems to go up for small portions
You're better off to the China town branch you can get a pad thai for $5
50 instead of $9!
The Scene This inviting bistro has well-worn red leather banquets, scuffed woodwork and amber lighting--it feels like a culinary relic whisked directly from the Left Bank
Hunker down at the bar or at one of the cozy tables and let offerings from local jazz musicians put you in the mood
The Food Despite the surfeit of Manhattan bistros, Jules manages to stand out from the pack--the dishes are charming, well-executed and occasionally innovative
While standards, such as the brandy-laden onion-soup gratinee and the wonderfully crisp and buttery croque monsieur, are sure to please, the more unlikely offerings, such as creamy oxtail ravioli, bring full-bodied flavors to the bistro formula
Top it all off with an above-average creme brulee
Good Food
Excellent Service

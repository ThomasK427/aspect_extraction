All NYC taverns should be like this
just re-opened with new owners
the service is fantastic and friendly
the prices are reasonable and the food is delicious and the bartenders all know how to pour a perfect pint o' guinness
it's got a great old time ambience
I was just walking by and I saw this hidden gem nestled in the heart of Times Square
Imagine my surprise, amidst all the corporate big name restaurants, to find a family run restaurant where you are treated like a member of the family
The staff is sweet and informative, the ambiance is appealing, and the cuisine is french country
My dinner started with a fish soup marseille, which was devine
Next course was Salmon in Beet Butter Sauce, superb
Two fresh vegetables, mashed potatoes, home made bread and scones served with your meal at a reasonable price
You can't beat it!
Ordered lunch at 11:09am, food showed up at 12:57PM
how long is that? 1 hour and 48 minutes! Finally sit down to eat container is broken and all the gravy leaked out
Okay, at this point I am starving and the wood on the table was starting to look good
I was so disappointed = ( Why o Why? it was greasy and did not taste like curry
It was that yellow fake curry like tumeric or fake saffron
It was horrible
The roti was dry, hard and bland
This place needs to close up shop and go back home
Where ever that may be
it sure is not the West Indies! Don't you think a true West Indian would know! Yes, I am
don't tell me I don't know what I am talking about
I eat this stuff for breakfast with Ma's pepper sauce from Trinidad

My wife and I often dine at Le Rivage before attending an evening performance
Best to arrive before 6:30 pm
The staff is friendly and experienced at getting customers out in time for the curtain
The food is always well prepared
Melon and proscuitto and escargo are great appetizers, the duck is always good and they make a hearty french-style beeef stew
This is a great place for pre- and post-theater dinners
The food is traditional, beautifully prepared and very reasonably priced
Where else can you get a prix fixe for under $25 that includes 4 courses (yup, they're so French they give you salad as well as a generous appetizer)? The wine list isn't stunning, but it has some good bottles and is likewise reasonably priced
Cozy enough to be romantic, brightly enough lit to go with friends
Friendly, capable service (the waitresses are Polish, the hosts French), Piaf and the like playing in the background, and pleasing decor make for a really wonderful experience
I went to this restaurant this past weekend, with my fiancee
We enjoyed the whole french experience
We have to bone up on our french though
I ordered the frog legs which seemed more like an appetizer than a main course
Glad I filled up on bread
I also had coquille soup which was wonderful; shrimps and scallops, in some kind of sauce
The frogs legs did taste weird, almost like chicken, but not close enough to where I did not rememeber what I was eating
My girl had the Monkfish
that was good, I ate some of it
A girl sitting next to me had duck, which was what I shoulda ordered
When I go back (hint hint), I will get the duck
Oh and the Chocolate mousse was extravagant! Service was somewhat slow, but thats time to enjoy your company
I know I did
Go eat here!
All of the Restaurant Row restaurants have to be good in order to survive, but Le Rivage outdoes them all: sumptuous entrees, wonderful desserts, and an appetizer display that'll knock your socks off
And all for a fabulous prix fixe that goes beyond being merely economical
If you're from out of town and doing the Midtown activities, this is the one restaurant you shouldn't miss
My wife and I have eaten at this restaurant several times over the past two years, both pre and post theatre, and never been disappointed
Also the prix fixe menu has far more choices on it than most of the competition in the area
We have tried a wide variety of the entrees and desserts all of which were very good
Pre theatre can get a bit busy but it never has affected the food, service or ambience and we highly recommend this place
You can be sure we'll be back
I browsed through the reviews of other patrons of this restaurant before I visited it today
The food is good especially it's a $18 lunch comees with 4 courses
You hardly find such a good value with such a tasty lunch in Manhattan! The restaurant is quiet and the service is good
I found the waitresses are friendly and very efficient
I'll recommend my friends to visit this restaurant and I will go there again! The veal is good but we don't like the salmon, it's kind of over cooked
i want to try out other main dishes next time
The menu provides a wide of food
I came to this restaurant for dinner, without a reservation
There was plenty of room
The prix fixe is a great deal
The food was outstanding
I've tried the baked mussels, the lobster bisque and the veal piccata
All were impeccable
I could not ask for better food, especially given that I have paid twice as much for food that wasn't as good at other places
The service was a little off
They were not as accommodating as they could be
However, the food was so good that I didn't care
The decor is very pleasant
I will be coming back to this restaurant and I wholeheartedly recommend it
The owner/family is wonderful
I ate in their resteraunt when I was a little girl and ate frogs legs happily when most kids would have never considered it
Now that I am living in the city and happily married the owner and staff still remember me and treat us like royalty
Why do they serve french fries? Because it's a traditional thing to serve in a French resteraunt - if you don't understand that you probably shouldn't be eating in such a wonderful place!!
Le Rivage is by far the best of the best when it comes to French food in NYC
The specials are always superb and the wine list is terrific
Great value and you are never rushed
Tell them you need to make a theather curtain and they will make sure you do
The food is excellent always
The fish dishes melt in your mouth
If you are a meat lover, you will receive your order cooked, as requested
The serves is impeckalbe
If you should arrive late
No problem
Let know you will that eight o'clock curtain call
When we visit New York we always include dinner at LeRivage
The location is great for pre-theatre
The food is always good and the atmosphere is quiet enough to have conversations at your table, unlike some places
The service is prompt and the atmosphere is friendly
We have always had a most enjoyable time
This is the ONE place we always go when visitng NYC from NC
The staff is friendly and helpful, the prix fix choices suit all tastes, the food is wonderful (especially the sweetbreads entree and sole bon femme), and the value can't be beat
We've never been disappointed with Le Rivage in 8 years!

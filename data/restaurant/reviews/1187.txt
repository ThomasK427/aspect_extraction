The sushi was excellent
The eel piece was very large and infused with the right amount of bbq sauce
Sushi was just scrumptious! Beware, the chefs pack the sushi pieces with wasabi so you don't need a lot of wasabi in your soy sauce
One major downside, the service is lacking
They put you water in very small cups and don't come around to refill often
In fact, it took me awhile to flag the waiter and when I did, he gave a bit of attitude
Even though they were slow in service, they had no problem handing us the check quickly
They neglected to ask whether we wanted any dessert
Anyway, if you can overlook the service, definitely come here because the sushi is good and the prices are very reasonable
The ambience is beautiful, the decor very peaceful
The waitstaff was pretty friendly and knowledgable
The All You Can Eat sushi special is great but also a pitfall for people like me who do not now when to stop
The value of it all was great
We came a little late so there weren't many people there
The sushi was amazing though
Very fresh and tasty
I would go back again but not over indulge as I did last night
The bar area has potential to be a happening spot too
The place was actually mostly filled with a hip, young Japanese crowd
Co co has real food
I was told that the owner chef has been in sushi business for over 35 years
!!! I thought I knew pretty much everything about sushi, but this guy made me realize that I was wrong
This is one of the rare places in New York where you can taste real traditional Japanese sushi, so you should sit at the sushi bar if you are a true sushi lover
Even if you are not, there are so many dishes that are truly delicious and INEXPENSIVE! The food here is soooo much better than Megu or Matsuri where your bill will be 5 times bigger!
The food, service and setting made for a perfect Fri night date
Everything my boyfriend and I ordered was ridiculously good
I'm psyched to find such a great place in Astoria
Service was great, but food disappointing
Grilled chicken with potato tasked more like roast turkey with giblet gravy
My husband liked his grilled scallops
Wine selection and desserts were nice, but I don't think I'll return soon
Perhaps it was a really off night at Le Sans Souci
We ordered wine and perrier and the waiter forgot to bring them
We reminded them
Apologies
Appetizers were good - we had the scallops and a salad
We ordered the duck and pork chops for entrees
The porkchop was a piece of leather - I mean in places barely pierceable with a fork
Additionally, the accompanying red cabbage and sauce were bland - the whole dish didn't work
The duck on the other hand was reasonably good
I politely sent the pork chop back and asked an extra plate so that my date and I could share her duck
Plate never came
We got the check
As we left, the hostess was apologizing to the next table for losing their order
Again - maybe an off night - but way off
my friend took me here last night and i absolutely adore the place! it's small and cozy with a real homey feel
i started with the french onion soup and he had the scallops appetizer
for entrees i had the duck which was absolutely delicious and he had the steak frites
dessert was creme brulee and assorted french cheeses
wine was the louie latour pinot noir then one i can't remember the name to
medoc? i'll definitely be back
it's a great date place
A waitress at this place once told me the name of the place translates roughly into without worries and the experience you'll have there lives up to the letter
Brunch is absolutely fantastic - I've tried everything and never been disappointed
Dinner is a tad dodgy, especially if you don't eat meat or fish
The fries are great
No detail is overlooked - even the bathroom sinks have a certain charm to them
They're authenically French in every way except one: the service - the staff (although at times spread thin) are genuinely welcoming, pleasant, and talk to you as though you've been friends for years
Very low-key
Honestly, you really should treat yourself to this incredibly lovely place
I've been to this restaurant about 3 times and always had a relaxing, delicous time
It is perfect for a long conversation over coffee- no rush to leave
The vibe is very comfortable and welcoming- the garden out back is very quaint, and the open doors in the front let in fresh air on spring days
The French Toast is KILLER- they add a little lemon flavor to it which makes it incredible
Although the servers seem a little under-staffed, they make up for it by remembering who you are and being extremely friendly
Its a definite trip to make- especially for the unbeatable prices
I was there the week before Thanksgiving with a friend
We did not make any reservation for a Saturday night dinner so we had to wait at the bar across the street for about 30 minutes, which was totally okay with us
It was a new restaurant and it got written up on NY Times the week before so I can understand the crowd
I ordered the curly endive with bacon and poached egg, and it was amazingly delicious
I had the mussel marinates and it was a little undercook, unfortunately
And the broth was very light
The french fries were nice and chrisp, and my friend loved his pork tenderloin stuffed with mushrooms (I think)
All in all, it was a very nice meal by Astoria standard
It would be an acceptable meal by other Manhattan French restaurant's standard
Excellent food, great service and a wonderfully cozy, comfortable low key ambience
I've been there twice and can't wait to go back
A most welcome addition to the neighborhood
I went few times to that typical and incontournable French restaurant and I can assure you that it is the next place you need to go
The food is so raffinee and the team so nice with you
I have not found yet another french restaurant like that in the city
Believe it or not
The prices are regular and you can enjoy a live band on fridays
I already have recommended Le Sans Souci to my friends and no one was disappointed
Will you be the next one?
This restaurant has been closed for well over a year, now
Not sure why it's till listed
The sushi /sashimi are fresh and tasty
I love the fact that they put the tempura flakes in all the rolls! Yumm
They have a clean fast environment! Quick deliveries too!
If you are an eel lover then this is the place for you
Best eel in Brooklyn and I know my eel
The Scene The corner space is head-to-toe windows, beckoning diners to this otherwise deserted block
Pretty women in vintage dresses and dapper men in wool blazers and Chuck Taylors crowd around the small bar, sipping quartinos of wine or freshly shaken mojitos
Friendly servers struggle to keep the handful of tables turning, so waits can stretch
The Food With dishes like "swine-o-the-week" and "box of rocks," owners and chefs Julie Taras and Tasha Garcia set a playful tone for their menu, but the hearty, meat lover-friendly dishes are anything but whimsical
Starters like grilled, sliced sausages--lamb, duck and pork--arrive sporting toothpicks for dipping into three savory homemade mustards; smooth, rich chicken liver mousse is smartly paired with sweet caramelized onions and figs for balance
Entrees are equally good, especially slow-cooked pork shoulder, tender and falling apart atop bright apple-cabbage slaw
Desserts shouldn't be missed, especially the caramel-y and slightly salty quince sticky toffee pudding
Little Giant is truly a giant in terms of its imaginative and constantly changing menu

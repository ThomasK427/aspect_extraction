By 7:05 it was packed
If you do what we did, you'll get a table
If you try for an 8:00 table, forget it
The place is interesting
The crowd is from trendy to normal to celebs
pretty young crowd
Anna Sui was sitting to my left
The food was great
We had baked oysters (good), prunes wrapped in bacon and grilled (very good) and the artichoke dip (very good) and I had a filet mignon with mashed potatoes (good but could've been more flavorful)
Overall, a very pleasant experience, although cramped and crowded
It's quirky and cute
Interesting location at the end of a non-descript alley
I say go for it
But get there at 6:55 p
m
They don't take reservations for parties less than 6
Not only do they enforce a Pre Fix menu at $60 a head for parties of 9+, but they do NOT inform you of extra surcharges for certain entree selections
The portions were generous, but the quality of food was not outstanding
I've had a better filet mignon at Outback
Not to mention, the cook apparently cannot tell the difference between a steak that is medium-rare and medium-well
No one from our table got their filet the way they ordered it
And I'm sorry but for a bill of over a $1000, they should cook my steak EXACTLY how I requested
I am never a complainer but this experience called for a bad review
Trendy, they say? I think not
More like eating in my grandfather's den with all of his hunting trophies hovering over me while I try to enjoy my over priced and over cooked steak
You think you've lived here long enough and know pretty much all there is to know about NYC until someone shatters that by mentioning Freeman's to you and you arrive and you see it packed w/ all the happening NYers and feel so left out
This place almost felt like a movie set, as it couldn't have been better laid out for a cool, quaint, hidden NYC gem
It's hip comfort food if that makes sense, it's quite alright and the portions are huge so don't over order
The artichoke heart dip shouldn't be missed
But this whole place is about ambience and it's as good as it gets
Feels like you are in London at Freeman's
I've been away for most of the summer and Ive been craving to go back to Freemans
Even though I'd been away, the host remembered me and welcomed me back
The wait, which can be long, was surprisingly short
We were told because we had arrived before the rush
While we waited, we tried a pisco and egg cocktail which was amazing! Ive never had a drink like it before
Once seated, we started with the meat pie and the reason for my return, the artichoke dip
Both were simple, fresh and unfussy
We then had the steak, chicken with succotash and a side of mac and cheese (so good) which were all amazing
I really love the casual friendly vibe and food of this place
Im going to be returning to Freemans more often now and will gladly become a regular
Although some people think freeman's is a place for the owner to cater to friends, I've never had that experience
During my first meal there (shortly after opening), the owner/staff introduced themselves and very welcoming
Drinks are great; food is wonderfully indulgent/affordable
Although waits can be a little long, the bar is big enough to have many people comfortably wait while sipping interesting wines and cocktails
Also, being nice/patient goes a long way; staff will more often than not remember you if you're not pushy
In a city where everyone is fighting to be in front, freeman's allows diners (if ready to turn off the competitive factor) to calm down and enjoy great food/conversation
It's worth the wait - plus if you don't want extra time and a fun place to chat with your date - then you shouldn't be going to dinner together
Go there; you won't regret it
Although the waits are brutal, get to this hidden gem early and you'll have a rewarding culinary experience with innovative cocktails to match
Been here twice on dates, first time had a table and a full meal, second time, sat at the bar with Tim the bartender (who recognized me from my first visit) who is a first rate mixologist and class act, and had some great apps
Service is great, prices are very reasonable, food is very interesting, loved the stilton cheese app, buffalo terrine, mac and cheese, and the pork is so tender its like ham
Great mixed crowd, young hipsters, middle-aged, les'ers and a smattering of yuppies
The people who don't like this place are probably from flyover states
The food was fantastic and inexpensive
The hors d'oeurves were by far the most exciting part of the meal--though a cliche, the artichoke dip is divine and the wild boar pate scrumptous
The main courses are extremely viscerally satisfying
For desert go with the bananas foster
If you have trouble getting a table come early on Sunday, otherwise wait at the bar and take advantage of the great winelist
You should have to wait for good food
Walking down the alley to Freemans, I felt instantly transported to another time and place
Inside, the space is quirky and fun
It was crowded, but we were seated quickly
The food was delicious and I enjoyed an excellent wine suggested by our charming bartender
Service could have been better, but it was beyond busy, so I give the waiters credit
I saw no snobbery or pretension at all, so don't worry about the bitter, party of one reviews below
If you are going to complain about cute girls getting seated first in trendy restaurants, you're definitely in the wrong city
One word of caution - just in case the animal heads on the wall aren't enough of a hint, be advised that you'll receive your fish au natural and staring up at you from the plate
If that bothers you, go with the filet mignon (delicious!)
What's with all these new trendy places with employees treating you like crap? My friend and I politely waited at the bar as the snotty host seated his friends and which ever cute girls came in after us
Finally, after I went to remind him that we hadn't evaporated, we were seated at a table squashed in the corner
Although it was still early, the staff clearly had other places to go, as was made clear to the few remaining diners by waiters stacking chairs on tables and curtly ending table service to go drink beers at the bar
Damn, well, if you really don't want our business, just tell us to our face
Quite a bummer
A little overrated, (aren't they all?), but pretty fun
The wait can be long and staff/owner friends will get tables ahead of you so be prepared to wait
Still worthwhile for the scene - 'I too can be lower east side cool! - look at my new/old t-shirt and sunglasses indoors!' It takes a lot of mousse for the tussled look, but they still come out in force for something with the tattered look
i agree, it was crowded but that just forced my date and i into each other's personal space that much quicker while waiting in the bar area
the place was warm and cozy and the food was delicious (i had the venison - which was excellent and unique, but i'm going back to try the lamb shank)
and the desserts MUST be sampled - the bananas foster was ridiculously good
just go and try it - you'll like it
Yeah, it's cool, but people with real cred don't do cool
You wanna wait a hour for a cramped table to eat mom's macaroni and cheese? Go ahead
Show off your moon boots, your uggs, your tiny Zoolander cell phone, your insert trendy accessory here
Puhleez
Save your attitude, cook at home, invite interesting people with depth and integrity, contributing to the world, rather than sucking it dry
In a nutshell, if you're not a friend of the maitre d' you're going to have to wait and see his friends seated before you (even though you arrived before them)
It's a place for the owner staff's friends, so if you're not one of them, you're in for a wait
Space is small, hot (steam pipe heating) but cool, and at least for now, crowd is downtown, hipster chic, but that's changing fast as word spreads
Food is like the venison meal you would have after a hunting trip with your uncle Ed in Minnesota, but if you're up for some lumpy mash potatoes and trout w/ full bone, you'll be content
Desserts could use some help
Bartender will treat you well if you are friendly, but well drinks are smaller than they should be
Yes, there was a wait, but we just got liquored up at the bar
The Aussie bartender made some mean Manhattans
Food when we finally sat down was homey, rich, and good (especially after all the booze)
We had a good time
It was a bit a scene, but that was half the fun
I plan on coming back
I've been to Freeman's 3 times
The first time was around 10pm and it wasn't too busy

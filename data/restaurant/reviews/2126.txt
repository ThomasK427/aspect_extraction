Okay Italian, not sure why all in this review are raving? Service was good and a pretty nice atmosphere but the whole fish special was not great (not to mention about the size of a sardine)
Pizza was good but not as good as many other places (try Gonzo)
This restaurant has a special place in my heart
First time I was there was Valentine's Day
This is where I was proposed to
Excellent food, great service atmosphere
Definitely should be on the top of your places to go enjoy an evening of Italian cuisine!
What can I say? Dragged here kicking and screaming having had 2 earlier bad experiences
I was astounded - what a change in atmosphere and more importantly, service
(Check my earlier review of 3/14)
The food was fantastic and the gorgeous Ashara and Mirlanda made us feel so welcome and so special
The complete opposite from previous visits
I am glad to report that they have got rid of that horrible guy and even the staff seem so much happier
I can now say that this has gone from THE worst restaurant experience I have had in NYC to one of the best in terms of both food and service
Keep it up - we will definitely be back
Chinese food designed for the American palate is usually greasy so you can expect that at Spades
The food is very tasty and they do have a short selection of steamed foods and brown rice
As far as service is concerned, it is not that great but their is a cultural difference in their modus aparendi
Their focus is on quantity not quality of service
In other words do not take it personal
I have eaten lunch at Spades a few times and each time I witness atrocious customer service
Today the hostess was positively frosty
Don't expect any special favors, but do expect to be rushed out the door
As for the food it is mediocre greasy Chinese food
don't waste your time
Chinese food so greasy, you can feel your arteries hardening
Great cure for a hangover or for too much health food
Friendly but busy staff and fast delivery too
Found this place from some review websites and was pleasantly surprised
Great kung pao chicken and szechuan dumplings
I love spicy food and they definitely know how to spice it up! We were only there for a light lunch and split our dish so I would love to go back and try more things! Highly recommended!
So much better than basic chinese - I recommend the lunch specials, a tremendous value if you split it over 2 days: entree, rice and soup - huge portions and great food
I'm a fan of chicken with garlic
Do your body a favor!
What a well kept secret in midtown! The food was delicious and very well executed
The service was very attentive
This is certainly superior Chinese food
The decor and ambience is not impressive but this is a place you go strictly to get a great meal without paying Tse Yang or Shun Lee prices
My Taiwanese friend told me her aunt travels hours from her home in New Jersey to go to this restaurant
No wonder, every food I had there was simply fantastic
But be aware, their dishes with two pepper signs -- which I love personally -- could make your hair stand
Fantastic, inventive, expertly prepared gourmet dishes
Never had a bad meal; everything is good
Never eaten here, but have frequented the bar and found the service and value to be excellent
Even better prices during happy hour
Everyone is friendly and people meeting each other, nice management and bartenders
Lots of regulars
Consistent
I've been to this restaurant for few years now and i never been fooled!! the plate of Chacuterie is really nice!(im french i know about charcuterie) my wife eat fish there all the time and it was always good quality (she's japanese she knows fish believe me) i always go for the meat and i did enjoy all my dishes so far (the cassoulet is great!!)
the service is steady and attentionate
the soufle Grand marnier is a must!! overall this a nice and relaxing place, good for date too
Good food; but for the price you should leave full
From the superb cocktails mixed deftly at the long bar to the well-executed dishes in the clubby dining room (or the more casual bar-side tables) this is a place to kick back and relax with friends or a date over beautifully prepared food served with professional care and lots of personal (but not overbearing) attention
Especially good are the bouillabaise, the steak tartare (and those sizzling, crispy fries!) and the lamb specials
A place to enjoy and come back to
A perfect place to end a hectic day or kick back with great jazz on Saturday nights
A quintessentially comortable resto (not really a bistro, in the Parisina sense) with uncomplicated and reliably tasy dishes -and some of the greatest french fries this side of the ocean
Great cocktails at the bar (and bar menu) but wine list could improve, esp
at low end
Attentive and very friendly staff both at bar and dining room
A keeper
I order lunch for pick up sometimes because it's close to my office
Today after I picked up my lunch and went back to the office, I had a voicemail from the restaurant
They had given me somebody else's order, even after they confirmed it was the beef szechuan I had ordered
They asked me to take back the wrong order because their delivery person was busy
When I dropped it off, they giggled and said sorry, like it was really funny that their customer had to even go back to deliver their food
I asked if they were going to offer something for the inconvenience and said so sorry, you can take some mints and laughed
Then they just ignored me
They have no idea of what customer service is
The service is horrible- the waiters, AND the managers have terribile attitudes and don't know what customer service is
And the food is
let's say questionable
Don't be fooled by the nice looking ambiance - they just foind a really good conrtractor and decorator
The last time I was there I ordered the General Tso's chicken for lunch and got what looed like popcorn chicken
I had these tiny chunks that didn't taste like anything! And when I spoke to the manager, he gave me an attitude and suggested I order something else next time! I was snubbed the rest of the time I was there! I've never been treated like that and won't be going there again
Do yourself a favor and skip this one
A great place to go in a group, family, or couple
They have great food - especially their duck and seafood soup are wonderful
Lunch time is always crowded with local business people, so go early, eat, and leave, so others can enjoy it too
Service is efficient and the food was served fast
One downside - not the best place for families with babies - it's very crowded, and waiters are moving fast around tables so little kids may find it uncomfortable, as our 2-year old did
Stopped in on a Friday afternoon, plenty of room
Great cocktail specials, a Manhattan for $5
95! I had two! Loved the extensive sushi and vegetarian choices, especially the Mock Duck
Friendly service and pretty Indochine-looking setting
Yummy Shanghai Chinese food, close to work - but with midtown prices
Lunch specials aren't bad, at $7 or so
Favorites include steamed pork leek dumplings, a vegetable dish consisting of snow peas, asparagus and green beans with a hint of garlic, and Amazing Duck - but the taste is as amazing as the price - $25!
Kind of a hit-or-miss as far as the food goes
For the Japanese food, the rolls tend to be better than the sushi (try the Xmas roll)
The Chinese food is pretty standard fare
Happy hour lasts until 7 and the 2-for-1 Sapporo specials are popular with the local after-work crowd
Amusing tidbit: There is perpetually a sign in the window indicating a bar tender position available, preferably a young woman
It's probably no wonder that none of these young female bar tenders work there very long
Went there for lunch the other day, good place to eat Chinese/Shanghai food in midtown for good prices too
Nice atmosphere and many business people go there for lunch too
Good service and I liked the food
Steamed Dumplings were good, as was the curry chicken I had
Meal for two was just $25 (incl
tax and tip!)

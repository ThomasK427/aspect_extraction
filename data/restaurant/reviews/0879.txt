The East Village location may be even better
I'm not sure what cuisine this restaurant is going for - if it's raw food - like a book in the entryway describes - then skip this trend
The food is first-rate awful - they managed to offend two countries in one meal - my husband's middle eastern platter (hummous, falafel, stale chips) was lo ta'im (not tasty) - and my mexican salad (bean, avocado, lettuce, stale chips) was muy repugnato
It wasn't cheap - and the waitress had an airy (malnourished?) look about her that kept us waiting 20 minutes for the bill
I haven't tried Ozu next door - but it's gotta be better - take my advice and go there - or keep walking up Amsterdam to Josie's in the 70s
The Scene Down a little alley and past the overflowing, convivial front bar area, the dining room glows in shades of peach, fuchsia and tangerine
Plush booths surround a glassed-in terrarium, adding a bit of air and spectacle to a space that might otherwise feel cramped
When it's crowded, the staff gets harried, which can take a toll on the dining experience at peak hours
The Food This gentle updating of Mexican cooking is very friendly to the palate, though some dishes weigh a bit heavy on the stomach
The dense, salty guacamole is absolutely superlative; a fava bean and goat cheese empanada is a light and delicious starter
Goat chunks, steamed to implausible tenderness in beer and coated with a thick, smoky spice rub make a memorable entree, as do enchiladas filled with roasted chicken and squash blossoms and topped with a light-but-rich pumpkin-seed sauce
The dishes here are okay but pretentiously named and overpriced for what you actually get
And for $12-15 for a margarita we expected at least some tequila in it, but neither my date nor I could taste or feel it - very weak - and I'm a lightweight
We had to request water and chips (tostades) and salsa three times (the third time my date had to go and track down the waitress) before finally being served (by the busser) and the place wasn't even a quarter full
Then it took another 10 minutes before the waitress graced us with her presence to take our order
And another 30 mintues to get our margaritas
So not worth the wait
So not worth it period
Too bad the food and service aren't nearly as nice as the decor
Great restaurant- from the great margaritas made wiht fesh lime juice and no mix to the delicious food
The plaintain crusted halibut was to die for! Everyone was very happy with their entrees
The restaurant is so pleasant and inviting
Can't wait to go back!
Okay, I LOVED my margaritas, chips and guacamole
But, I LOATHED my chile en nogada
A chile en nogada is the most decadent dish (in my opinion) in Mexican cuisine
This one completely FELL SHORT of my expectations
My friend's halibut with salsa verde was outstanding, but she was not too impressed either
I'd like to go back, but this time I'd try something less authentically Mexican and go for something American Mexican like tacos or seafood
Bless you Suenos
This place is great
Definitely start out with the cornbread
You'll be asking for more
It's one of bits you want to keep eating but stop yourself short because you're worried about filling up on the apetizer
worst margaritas in town,if you are going to order a battle of (white wine)they served hot
service very bad, it take 25 minutes to get my appettizers, when ask if the chef is in they said no,
I've eaten here a few times and I haven't been disappointed with the food yet! Each dish is a wonderfully unique and upscale take on traditional Mexican flavors
The drinks are tasty and the price fix menu is well worth the splurge, just make sure you're hungry
I highly recommend Suenos for a great weekend dinner!
The place is nice, relaxed, yet funky flair and the indoor/outdoor layout was very nice (the resturant is shoe-horned into a backyard, but is enclosed in a greenhouse, revealing an outdoors garden)
The portions are skimpy and it was irksome to get chips and salsa for the table
The guacamole was fabulous, but stingy! - they charged per person, (five dollars!)
They served a small-ish sized bowl of guac (creamy and salty
ummm), and handfuls of chips and soft tortillas
Tasty, but over-priced
My tuna was done perfectly and the mangotinis were refreshing
Others had the hanger-steak special and were very satisfied with it
The place is nice, if not extraordinary
Essentially, we had a nice experience except for the loud cackling multi-cultural party of eight seated below us in the open 'party room
' Didn't your mothers teach you about to how behave in public? They should have been cut off
Although I would agree with some that the service can be slow, my over all experience was outstanding
The margaritas were fantastic, made with fresh ingredients and great tequila, just like those I have found in Mexico
The bartender was charming and offered to let me sample different types of tequila and mescal
The food was fresh, flavorful, authentic and presented well
For a true Mexican experience, I would highly recommend Suenos
Had a reservation but was not seated until 45 minutes after reservation
Spoke with the manager about comping a round, after we had already paid for 2 rounds waiting for the table
He said he would get back to me and never did
We were seated in a hallway, not the main dining room
We told our waiter that the margaritas weren't very good, and he said most customers sent them back because they were too bitter
Next our server mixed up all 4 appetizers-all were mediocre at best and some undercooked
The main dishes arrived about 45 minutes after the appetizers-which were indeed better
We had no silverware and our waiter did not notice
We were largely ignored throughout our meal
The only thing that was brought with rapid speed was the check
Very warm atmosphere and wonderful cuisine to match
I had a great meal here, the squash soup was terrific as was my venison- cooked to perfection
The service was great and the wine list works well with the food offerings
Having been to Mexico numerous times and yearning for the same culinary experience, that is what Suenos delivered yet again
Go and enjoy!
Was really looking forward to dinner here -- I live in the neighborhood and had heard some good things
Service was good, except for a very long gap between appetizers (which came out too quickly) and entree (whick took another 45 minutes to arrive)
Appetizers were good, entree was poor (I had duck empenadas)
I was treating a party of four, and I realized how outrageous the prices were when I got the bill
The dining room was very cool ambience great, bar was quaint and neat, the staff was incredibly friendly
Our appetizers were incredible almost too big, kind of destroying our appetite for the main course
Both of our main courses, however, weren't all that great
just not that unique and eye-catch a taste or flavor, just sort of bland
Also the entree menu was very un-Mexican, it had all the usual staples from an American restaurant, which was weird
From that end it was kind of disappointing
The other knock was the entrance to the restaurant it was all these neon lights, as if you were walking into a 24hr deli, quite odd
because once you get inside it's very nice inside
Suenos has great food and killer margaritas but as indicated in a previous review, seems to have missed the lesson on customer service
From the call to make a reservation to the goodbye on the way out of the restaurant, staff is incredibly arrogant, annoying and condescending
I have been to Suenos at least 5 times (once for brunch) and keep hoping that the management will teach the staff that there are plenty of restaurants in the city that offer great customer service and that word of poor customer service is a sure way to lose customers and unfortunately travels like wildfire
Suenos is a little oasis, with it's unique and intimate decor, including a little table set off like a DJ booth in the corner of the dining room where fresh tortillas are made througout the evening
And the food is tremendous, melding strong flavors in a unique way, with the chef bringing her own stamp to traditional Mexican cooking
Although it is a little pricey, it is well worth the occasional splurge
The combinations sound good on paper but most dishes are heavy or muddy
Good quality ingredients but hit or miss execution
Oh and our server was arrogant and unhelpful
They seem to think they are the Mexican Daniel ! (The wrong idea since Daniels service is anything but arrogant) Perhaps it was just an off night
The food is very good -- carnitas were fantastic
Appetizers good -- great guac
With the exception of the cool upstairs bathroom, the decor is kinda old school cheezy mex -- pastels, etc
The service is ok -- some of the staff was busier with friends than with customers
The prices were a bit high for Mexican food, but the food was quite tasty
Overall, better than average
After much anticipation I was very let down with my meal
Though the menu sounds imaginative, it is executed poorly

They also need a full bar
The tab is a bit expensive for middle of the road Indian dining so beware
My boyfriend and I each had the tasting menus, which were fantastic
The waitstaff was pleasant, helpful, and attentive
The restaurant is cozy and warm and very clean
To be honest, I don't know a lot about Indian food apart from having a general liking of curries and spicy things
We found dining here to be enjoyable - the service was polite and the food was commendable
The food was alright but not excellent
A bit pricey for such a tiny restaurant
Everything was average
Ok the word Amma means Mom in South India so I thought this would have a nice motherly indian twist with a fushion flare
Well it so happened to turnout to be a total sell out to the non indian non food lover crowd
Sure it's different from normal indian food but nothing to write to your mom about and very pricey
I wasn't impressed and it wasn't SPICEY???? The quality of the meat was on par with your local grocery store
We hadn't had Indian food for awhile and we stumbled onto Amma while walking through our neighborhood
What a find! The place is pretty, very comfortable and the service is first-rate! And, the food? Outstanding! Everything was fresh, very tasty and beautifully presented
Chicken and lamb entrees were wonderful and the rice side (curry, tomato and lemon) was colorful and delicious!
I went to Amma a few days ago because a friend recommended it to me
I'm glad that I decided to go
absolutely loved the tasting menu
Not only did I feel satisfide with the amount of food, but the way the food was brought to the table and presented made me and my date feel welcomed
its worth the experience
I didnt get a chance to order from their traditional dinner menu
but the descriptions of some of the offered dishes wereenticing, and probably just as tasty
The staff is friendly, and seem to be very experienced
I had a chance to talk to one of the chefs and the owner!
fantastic people
very charming
all in all the experience was absolutely amazing
the location is great and the food is simply heavenly
A MUST GO
being indian i am very picky about finding good quality food
the menu at amma certainly piqued my curiousity as it is devoid of the typical chicken vindaloo and instead has the more interesting regional variations
the rice choices were very good as was the lamb, the fish and chicken disappointed as they did not live up to their namesakes
overall i will be back as amma provides a funkier and definitely more varied version of indian food than the standard cookie cutter indian restaurants
The food, wine pairings, the attentive service, the charming self effacing chefs/owners were a surprising treat in the world of Indian restaurants
The tasting menu was fantastic
Dynamite as I had heard on NPR
Try Amma, it will win you over and make you a new fan of Indian cuisine
My husband and I tried the 8-course tasting menu with wine pairing
He did the vegetarian and I did the non-vegetarian
The meal was Indian food that we have never had before: sophisticated, elegant and healthy
It's definitely a romantic date place
Not for kids or groups
My meal at Amma has now taken the lead as my all-time favorite culinary event
My friends and I spent 4+ hours partaking of the flavorful tasting menu
Not only was the food mind-numbingly delicious, but the wine parings were perfect! I recommend the seven course tasting menu (there is also a vegetarian counterpart on the menu); it's a great way to get a feel for what this unique restaurant has to offer
Everything from the Bhel Puri and the crispy okra to the lightly decadent mango cheesecake was perfectly timed and just the right amount
Please do try Amma - it is a remarkable restaurant
The experience was superb, surprising, unexpected, overwhelming, alas fattening
Reviews had us expecting miracles, but still, we expected less
Course after course, the chefs impressed us and kept our interest alive, even as our bellies got fuller
Wine pairings were inexpensive fine finds
Service, courteous/supplicant to a fault
Cheesecake was mucho mango-ey and light, the kalfi with citrus soup was rich, tasty, memorable and Indian from another world
NY Magazine discovered a winner, a first in what shall be a trend Indian cuisine should follow
Salute to the chefs
Salute to the menu and pairings of dishes!
Tasting - Passage to India will try again
large with variety
not tiring/tedious like degusatation menus can be
Food- fresh, authentic with flair  Sommelier - a pleasant surpise, voide of usual ceremony and fuss
limited, well chosen offering
Ambience - rich colors bracelet votives from India   Music- shade better than other Indian rests (read Tamarind/Dawat)
more fusion and modern Indian, less religious chants   Chefs (Mather of Dewan Anglo-Indian cookery teacher/food writer) - talented articulate  Service- Of the Old Indian school, spotting of professionals could add overall
Pros - unexpected treasure, makings of multi-location restaurant empire (Indian chefs going the way of Ducasse and Nobu??)  Cons: old reviews clutter wall of restaurant
owners ought to find value in discovery
enough advertising! far too classy for that
Religious sculptures in dining area and bar detract from otherwise contemporary air
Thanks to Gael Greene (NY Mag) and Citysearch for leading us to this unexpected Indian treasure
The tasting menu puts others offered at higher prices to shame
Pairings of tastes, textures and spices surprise with each course
Portions are ample but not overwhelming
Wines paired by sommelier are inexpensive and complimentary
Chefs are in and out of kitchen sharing their culinary gospel
I seriously havent been to another Indian restaraunt that can match the quality of service, food, and atmosphere that Amma has
I am a life long fan of this restaraunt and wish it much success
Good place to take a date
A little pricey for Indian food
Meat Entree's start at about $20 Veggie Entree's start at about $17  Overall good place to try
Don't know if it's a regular place though
the service was awesome ! the owner recommended a dish from his own menu, and it was heavenly- chicken bhosha or something like that
altho it was a little pricey, it was well worth it, servings were huge
the nan was amazing
mango lassi the best i ever had
sag paneer was an awesome mix of spices
i recommend this place highly
I commend the owners for making all the efforts to make this place into one of the most top rated restaurants in this city
Service is so good that you almost feel that you are at home
Keep up the good work guys
The meal was a complete Dinner and I could not have asked for anything more
A must visit place for all Indian food lovers
I found this place on Citysearch so I checked it out and it was great!! Great masala dosha!! Great service and the food was great and very reasonably priced! I reccommend this to all my friends now!!
Im a diabetic, thus I have to watch what I eat, however I didnt think that the food at amma's was oily at all
ACtually I love to food so much, I eat their almost twice a week
I reccommend their tandoori vegetables
absolutely delicious
I thought it was good, but not all that
I liked the mint paratha to start with, the kachori was also good, but spicy
We had the spinach with chickpeas- too many chickpeas- not enough Spinach (which was the best part!) The rice with fresh vegetables was way too greasy and fried

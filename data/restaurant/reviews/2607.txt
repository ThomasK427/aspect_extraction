I've been here a couple of times
It has always been a great experience
The staff and owner are very attentive and very accommodating
Some of the best Sake I have and the special rolls are amazing
We were so happy with this restaurant
The sushi was fresh and creative
Every aspect of our dining experience was enjoyable
The atmosphere is perfect and the staff enthusiastic
Better than any other sushi places in midtown west side
I would compare it to any of the higher prices premium sushi places in the city but the prices are rock bottom
I found the quality at least as good as Blue Ribbon and definitely better than Sushi Samba
GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!! YOU'll LOVE IT
I was part of the group with coffee4me
We did get seated promptly, but after telling us that with such a large party we should order as soon as possible, we did not see a server again for over 15 minutes! It took a long time for all the food to come, but it is disgraceful for 3 of our party to have had to wait another 20 minutes for their food
And then the wait for the check was ridiculous
We arrived at 6:00 which should have been plenty of time to comfortably make our 8:00 show, but we barely made it in time
The restaurant overall was great
I enjoyed the food, service, and Sake
I am giving the restaurant two thumbs up! I would definitely recommend it
We read too much into the reviews and thought to try this place over some other restaurants in the area
We were highly disappointed
The food was only so-so, the ambience was not the best - (we were seated at a table with a wooden beam taking up half of the table plus there was an electrical socket right next to my ear), and the owner does listen in to your conversations as mentioned by another reviewer
For my money, I would spend it somewhere else
This place had great service! The people were friendly and extremely helpful
We were new to Japanese food, and despite it being closing time, the staff took time to explain what things were, how they were cooked, and how to use chopsticks!
We had made a reservation for a pre-theater dinner
Our table was ready when we arrived, and we told the host, who was very pleasant, that we had theater tickets for that evening
It took too long for the server to take our order
The kitchen had difficulty preparing the food in a timely manner
The meals were not brought out at the same time
In fact, three of our meals were so late in arriving that almost everyone else had finished eating before they arrived
The sushi was delicious
The chicken teriaky was decidely less so
Much of the chicken was overcooked and dry
The rest had grizzle in it
For the price of the meal, the chicken certainly should have been trimmed better
The service was sub par
We had to stand up to leave before we finally received our oft-requested check
Unlike Bond St in decor (nor its deafening volume/prices!)
Raku is charming and will not burn hole in wallet (ea sushi pc avgs abt $2
75/pc, not $5)
White tuna is not found in most typical sushi restos, but Raku carries this-Yay! Toro was excellent! As a sushi lover and one who's dined the entire range, one can always come home to Raku
it's not pretentious
My wish is to have amberjack (a special yellowtail type) added to menu - but not many places in NYC do
The Veggie Sushi Sampler is creative/tasty - a pleasant surprise which will please vegetarians
Good portions hope they DON'T get any larger (like Yama's - too big!) - o/w, how else will one have enough room to try other unique treats?! This place has potential to be contender for places like Blue Ribbon but, thank goodness, w/o the ridiculously long wait
Bon apetite, mons amis!
I went to Raku for Valentine's Day and had a wonderful time
The service was beautiful and we ordered the chef's special selection (The Love Boat) and it was soooo good
There was a great variety and the food was flawless
Thank you so much for the great hospitality!
It's nothing like ruby fools and half the price of Nobu without the celebrity markup
Neo is just cold fish with fancy sauce compared to Raku
Raku offers up some of the best sushi we have had in
since I can remember
Everything from the Private Candel lit booths to the warm atmosphere
While all the sushi was fantastic, Go for the lobster tempura Roll as well as the crazy dragon or white dragon rool
OUT OF THIS WORLD
what we also liked was the warm rice surounding every mouth watering piece
Service was great
very attentive and no rush atmosphere
the owner make his rounds and will listen to any advice or special requests you may have
over all a great friday surprise for us
we will be back and even try their sister restaurant on the upeer west
For those who love shushi, they should try Raku
I didn't think it was that until I went to try it myself! Believe me, the review that was posted are true
Try the Crazy Dragon Roll, and the Tri-Color Roll!
This is one of the best finds in New York
Sushi high quality yet so affordable
I highly recommend the spicy sashimi salad, white or black dragon roll with the white tuna, and unfiltered sake
Very tasty sushi served with a smile
Owner Ray did his best to make us feel at ease, and was great in recommending a good sake
The fish was fresh, and the kick in our spicy sushi rolls was incredible! We will definitely be coming back for more some time soon!
I would highly recommend Raku
The restaurant is very comfortable and casual, very nice atmosphere
The service is excellent and very helpful
The sushi is outstanding
After trying out the various smaller sushi restaurants around town, I found Raku very refreshing
The sushi was great and the ambiance was perfect
The staff was friendly and the service good
I don't know where the Raku bashers were, maybe having an out of body experience at some other place, but they should try it again, but this time they should bring taste buds
My friends came from all parts of the U
S
(Boston, Washington D
C
, and Atlanta) to visit me up in New York City for the weekend, and I made reservations to Raku Restaurant for the first time
When we walked in we were immediately seated by the restaurant owner, Ray, who was as friendly as could be
He told us all about the restaurant and their specialties and helped us to select our orders
We had a large group, party of 8, and there was plenty of leg room for all of us at the table
We ordered many different items from which I would strongly recommend the White Dragon roll, White Tuna roll, Spider Roll, Super Sushi Combo, and Crazy Dragon Roll
To tell you the truth just about everything on the menu was splendid
For dessert we had green tea ice cream and sweet pears, which were both delicious!
I tried Raku based on their 9
8 rating
What a shock and waste of time and money
The sushi was sub-par
I eat sushi almost every other week, from mid-level places to fine dining japanese
This place couldnt compete with any of them
The fish was not that fresh
The selection was limited

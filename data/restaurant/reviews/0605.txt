Authentic guacamole made at your table (fresh, but not as spicy as we asked for)
The tuna and roast pork were outstanding entrees
Don't miss the lobster tacos - bite size, spicy, and delicious
Pistachio crepes stuffed with bananas for dessert is a winner and top it all off with a Mexican coffee
Steve Hanson has done it again
I went to Dos Caminos on the night it opened
The service was great
The table side guacamole was incredible - a must order! I already made rservations to go back again
You can tell that this restaurant is going to be great once they work out the kinks
The guac was great, but service was slow and the food was not amazing
We asked our waitress to recommend a few things and she said I really can't recommend one thing over another
Knowing Steve Hanson's restaurants
a few months from now it will be on par with the rest
I will go back then
The Scene Columbia grad students and neighborhood hipsters fill up the dozen or so tables in this minuscule Manhattan Valley pioneer
Named for the not-so-nearby A train, the restaurant's decor features a subway map shower curtain and dimly lit, painted brick walls
The kitchen, such as it is, is in the dining room
Smiley faces on the check and a hearty thank-you-for-coming handshake characterize the service
The Food Refinement is the key at quasi-Caribbean A
Most dishes feature one thing done well, with no frills
Confit of duck leg with spicy mango salsa is tender and crispy with a welcome kick, though the accompanying potatoes are bland
Three links of intoxicatingly seasoned rabbit sausage sit unadorned on a plate, and do quite well enough on their own
Vegetarian options are in relative abundance, considering a menu of eight or so items, but they tend to be lackluster
A surprise real winner
Choices are narrow, but the food certainly doesn't feel that way
I'm vegetarian; my husband a solid meat eater- and we were both asking ourselves when we had a more enjoyable, delicious meal
Read negative reviews elsewhere, feel they were penned by people who shouldn't be dining there in the first place- a bunch of snobs with misplaced expectations
Not romantic enough? (what did you expect? rose petals?!)
Food a let down? (sounds like a bunch of French purists to me
A is exactly as it sounds- cozy (it will be warm there on a typical summer night, you hear everyone else's convos), fun (think romantic subway), sweet hole in the wall with wonderfully divised food, kind helpful staff, and the price and byob makes it all the better
Spent our 1st
wedding anniversary there and couldn't be happier at our choice
This is a great (although tiny) place that serves really creative food
BYO allows it to be very inexpensive and a great find
I had heard about it for years but didn't go until last week
It deserves the good word of mouth it is getting
Bring your date and a bottle of wine! A brings a bohemian romance to the otherwise lacking upperwest side
The restaurant is not much larger than a car on the A train, which it was named after
Tables are close, so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons
The food was as creative as the decor and both worked
The duck was excellent
The help was extremely nice and did not rush us
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert, it was overpriced and fell short on taste
This place was fabulous
The interior, food, staff - every single thing
I will be back again and again
I've been to the downtown version - Ivo and Lulu - loved that as well but this one had a certain charm
I had the grilled avocado and the chicken dish - both delicious
We brought a bottle of wine and did not feel rushed at all to leave
You can not get a better meal for the price
Brilliant concept
Cheap and delicious
We live around the corner and have made it a point to try everything on the menu (there's only 4 app's and 4 entrees)
It's one of our favorite local spots
Sometimes we just go to have the brie-encrusted pheasant pate with truffle oil
It's addictive
No coffee or alcohol
Just tea and water
A is definitely not your typical manhattan restaurant
but that's what makes it so great
There are few BYOB restaurants in manhattan that are worthwhile, and A is one of them
The menu at A is fairly constant, but they do what they do very well
I enjoyed the duck pate (great starter) and the lamb
My boyfirend introduced the place to me, and we've gone back frequently since
This reviewer is so astute
A is a great find and perfectly situated in the area of Manhattan Valley known mostly to locals and adventuresome twentysomethings
So go check it out, and order the creme brulee
C'est magnifique!
I read about this place in Time Out magazine
They were absolutely right
It's a great find in Astoria
Great value
Great food
You can't ask for more! GO GO GO!
GREAT and INEXPENSIVE Italian brunch food! attentive waitstaff and one kind - and hardworking - chef
foccacia, eggs, pasta and pizzas - all ingredients taste very fresh and of high quality
delicious fresh oj and unlimited baskets of bread and olive oil
coffee (a little watery) for only $1! also unlimited refills
no dish on brunch menu over $11 - definitely worth the price
nb: cash only, small, no a/c
Consistent, good, cheap sandwiches in lots of varieties
Good coffee as well
The Scene  The owners of Flea Market, the French-bohemian haunt in the East Village, have recreated a Parisian street scene, Epcot-style
Faux storefronts lead into Cafe Charbon, a veritable Gallic bar adorned with aged-wood tables, white tiled floors and Gauloise-puffing bon vivants
Next door, Epicerie's casual dining room is playfully postmodern: Stocked with everything from French laundry detergent to fancy foodstuffs, it looks like a Target advertisement en Francaise
The Food  The daily changing menu, scribbled on chalkboards and translated by friendly, French-accented servers, features reasonably priced, unpretentious bistro fare
Rustic dishes outshine elaborate efforts: Creamy duck terrines and oversized bowls of mussels delight, but anise-scented escargot are under-seasoned
Crispy duck confit and bacon-wrapped mahi mahi are simple and succulent
The caramelized coconut-banana tart is worth the trip alone
This is a legit place to eat
My girlfriend and I ordered the prociouto and spinach sald, the chevre cheese with tomatoes, soup du jour, and beef carpaccio
All where above average and priced appropriatly
Service is very nice
I would eat here again if i had more time
I ate here when it first opened back in 2002 and, after reading the scathing reviews on Citysearch I was really bummed out -- the dinner I had wasn't bad at all
I hadn't thought about it again until a friend recommended their Sunday brunch
We had a party of seven and, although the service wasn't especially attentive, it was better that way -- we were all much more focused on hanging out with one another than having some fancy epicurian experience
The doors open, plus there is outdoor seating for smokers who like to light up after a meal on a nice day
And the brunch deal is a real steal -- ten dollars gets you grub, OJ and coffee which is just perfect for people like me on a NYC-work-in-entertainment budget
If you go on a Sunday you're privvy to checking out the pedestrian mall on Orchard Street

All should give this place a try, I'm sure you will be back many more times
I met my friend here for dinner one night
I had the sausage with sweet peppers, which were okay
I found the dessert interesting: red wine plum with marscapone; the wine selection was decent
Overall: there isn't anything extrodinary, but it was fine
The LES branch from Broolklyn, this is great place to drop in for any reason (I took my mom)
This place serves the one-two combo of simple but extremely well-executed dishes and decent affordable wine
My inner-oenephile was amazed to find a place as inexpensive as this serving reds chilled in a fridge
The attention doesn't stop at the wine and goes far into the menu with their spuntino (snacks in italian)
with extra, extra virgin olive oils and fresh ingredients
I started w/a apple/gorgonzola watercress salad, but I'm definitely stealing the idea of my mom's salad for my next soiree: fig puree/pecorino romano on watercress
We both had the pasta special (tagliatelle), and a top-notch lentil soup
all very well made
The red brick, tin-ceilings and dark wood talbes are perfectly cozy for a date, but quarters are a little tight, so go early
I found the service efficient, pleasant, and attentive
I can easily see why these guys got nominated for best new restaurant
I have been to Frankies 457 in Brooklyn at least 5 times for dinner and have always had an amazing meal
I couldn't wait to be able to walk to Frankies 17 to get my italian food fix
Thanks for opening another one nearby! I agree
the gnocchi is delicious and the cavatelli is even better! This is the place to go for real italian food
tight quarters - but great food! try the gnocchi - fantastic!
Unbelievable that our little unassuming neighborhood has given birth to a top class Japanese restaurant that ranks in decor, service and food with the established big boys - Nobu, Masa to name a few
From the moment you enter the front, you are led to a large and impressive dining room hidden away by a discreet wooden sliding door
How very Japanese
The restaurant's best kept secret is its $70 prix fixe menu
Not only do you get to pick your hot/cold appetizer, soup, vegetable and entree, they fete you with at least three amuse bouche appetizers
We got to taste, with compliments, Kumamoto oyster with caviar, pina colada and Kobe beefball wrapped around foie gras
There is none of the uncalled-for hype that seems to stricken new celebrity restaurants
The clientele is understated and happily so for all diners because now, you can enjpy your food in a wonderful setting without feeling surrounded by pretentiousness
(Caveat, the night we were there, it wasn't as romantic as we would have liked
three Aussie women loudmouthing their opinions about friends having casual intimate relationships and the latest UN office politics)
I think that this restaurant is getting the shaft
I have read so many reviews of both locations
Midtown and tribeca and all of them say great food and occasionally some that was not great but still good and the servers pace the meal superbly and you don't feel rushed
But they still only get like two stars
I say this first because I wanted whoever reads this to understand alittle of what was in my head prior to going to Midtown
When I went I went with three friends
I had the prix fix tasting menu at only 70 bucks was not a bad deal at all
my three friends each ordered off the menu
the food was great, and the pacing of the courses was perfect my prix fix courses came at the same time as my friends al a carte items came so we didn't feel left out of eachothers experience at the restaurant some of the best service that I have had in a very long time
well done
I absolutlely would give this place three stars at least
I have been waiting for sooooo long to have MEGU in Midtown
Finaly I tried MEGU Midtown last Tuesday with my girlfriend(she is always picky about food and ambience), it was FANTASTIC!!!!
We were so blown away with the quality and Value of Selection MENU, it was only $70 and worth worth worth
I heard that Megu is extremly expensive but i only paid $110 per peson
She loved it and we had very romantic time too:) Highly recommend this place
I just made another resevation to take my partner coming from Italy next week, he is another picky guy
will see
thank you MEGU !
I went with some friends who were dying to check out the new hot spot! We have previously dined at the downtown location, but this one in midtown was so elegant and cozy, we thoroughly enjoyed the evening very much
The food was excellent just as we expected, and we discovered some new dishes such as the zucchini okaki instead of the asparagus okaki which was really great! On top of that, they offered a tasting menu for $70, which is a new concept for midtown exclusively
I liked the fact that there were some variations from the downtown location, so it is more interesting
We will definitely go back
it is worth the trip!
Wasn't impressed by food here, considering hoopla and price
Decor is understated, extremely fine and elegant
Service impeccable, but a bit much for my taste (i
e
, sliding doors that completely hide the restaurant from view until they are ready to seat you, in order to add to the ooh, aah factor)
Miso soup very nice
not overly salty
Kobe beef carpaccio nothing special
Complimentary kobe beef ball in toasted panko bread crumbs sublime
Complimentary dish of little meguro pieces with avocado nothing special
For sushi, we got least fatty type of tuna (they offered about 8 grades of fattiness), and the hamachi
In both instances, I've had better elsewhere
Not sublime as great sushi should be
Shrimp sushi roll was very good
it seemed to have chopped walnut in it? For dessert we got the green tea cake and the warm chocolate cake
Both very good
I wanted to celebrate my husbands recent promotion and decided to try Megu Midtown
The evening started and ended well
The food was delicious, and the windows from floor to ceiling really lent great light and elegance to the whole event
The sushi was the freshest that I have ever tasted: in the city or anywhere! The food was fantastic, the service was attentive, and the plates were distinctly Megu
The wine selection was as comprehensive as the meals, and the whole experience was beautiful
I've been dying to try the new MEGU, and I'm happy to say, I wasn't disappointed
The menu is slightly different from downtown, but they still have my favorites -- madai salad with hot sesame oil, shrimp kanzuri, the diamond roll, the crispy shrimp roll
I love that they don't rush you so that they can turn the table
They'd rather impress their guests with good food good service -- which makes sense, since I recognized at a handful of important people in the room
Just makes you think, a professional, patient staff is worth every penny
MEGU's 2nd location is very different than the TriBeCa flagship -- It's the same quality food, but it's a totally different scene! If you're planning a big group celebration or just want drinks apps in a trendy setting, then downtown is the way to go
But if you're planning a corporate dinner for 4 (or dinner with the in-laws) then you may be better suited sitting across from the UN! With the gorgeous new dishes/glasswire, an award winning wine list, unique (but pricey) cocktails, and a very knowledgeable, professional staff -- it's an elegant experience that goes above and beyond
Make a note to go at sunset! The golden light filters through the large windows and you can't help but feel special for getting a reservation!
The new Megu in Midtown caught me by surprise
I have dined at the original Megu in Tribeca a couple of times and enjoyed it, however I like the new Megu better
Smaller in size, it felt warmer and more intimate and service was focused and unobtrusive
Some dishes I liked most at Tribeca were curiously missing from the menu in Midtown - the spicy breaded asparagus and salad with yuzu dressing come to mind - however more items are apparently to be added
As it was, the $70 prix fixe course offered plenty of choice (like luscious Kobe steak for a $20 supplement) and allowed us to explore different parts of the menu
Other highlights included spicy kanzori crab and excellent sushi
Dessert I found mediocre, but Japanese restaurants are not usually known for their sweet selection
Overall, we had a fantastic time and plan on returning soon
The food was exquisite and well spaced out between servings
The service was impeccable
The place is quite airy with nice views of the UN - ask for a window table
Go for the prix fixe at $70 - a great deal for the number of servings you get
I just wish this place had a dress code - It deserves it
I was here for dinner this past weekend and I have to say it was one of the best restaraunts I've EVER been to
I am a total foodie, having been to most of the 4 and 5 star places in manhattan
Food at Dressler was so delicious and fresh

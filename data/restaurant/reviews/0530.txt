The steaks are well-marinated and the chicken is juicy and tender! Too bad they don't deliver
Coming from Los Angeles I know what good mexican food taste like
After trying so many places in NYC for a good burrito I have finally found a place with a good burrito
Although a little pricey, its well worth your money
They have a happy hour too
$14 pitcher of sangria, you cant beat that
My guess is that this is the type of place that most people go to once and attempt to forget as soon as possible
Below average food, small portions and no flare for real Mexican food AT ALL! I paid $11 dollars and got a very small burrito with a bag of tortilla chips that tasted like they were fried in last week's vegetable oil
They didn't even include salsa
Avoid this place!
Fast, relatively cheap, and more for your money than Burritoville
Check out the chalk board for drink specials
As part of a group of nine, I was recently treated to a tasty/courteous/all access lunchtime
Order some basics (Chicken Makhani/Sag Paneer), but save room for one of the restaurant's recommended specials: we tried a red sauced chicken bbq'd in one of the kitchen's clay pot ovens
Breads were hot to the touch and several types of yogurt lassis were offered (mango was the table's favorite, but try a salt lassi for a switch)
Ask the owner, Kahn, nicely and you might just score a tour of his action packed kitchen space
Costs could be better - expect to be upsold by the hovering wait staff - and come for the authentic tastes, not the interior decor (looked a littel like Cheers!)
Give Curry Leaf and it's authentic South Asian cuisine a try
Duck yesterday's scene across the street and eat where it's all about the food
The Curry Leaf was my favorite Indian restaurant in New York, but unfortunately I won't be returning anytime soon because the service was so bad
I can say that the food is delicious and the value is great
However, I took a good friend there for her birthday a few weeks ago and was so disgusted with how they treated us I will never go back
Among a number of things, they rushed us through our meal and as we were finishing our drinks our server held a running vacuum at our feet until we got up and left
I can appreciate wanting to go home but it was 10:30 on the dot (when they close) and I had already paid and tipped very well
I can highly recommend the food, but beware when looking for an enjoyable dining experience
Although the food was good, the way our waiter treated us was so rude and bad-mannered that it almost ruined our night and he even asked us to give him a better tip!!! I would not recommend this restaurant 'cause it was not a good experience in general
As an indian person myself, this restaurant was well above average and the service was also pretty good
I have come here twice and not only was a generous proportion of food given to us the quality was also high
Both times we've received free dessert
The crowd is multicltural and the ambiance is clean and cultural
Definalety the best indian food in the Brooklyn area
This place has the best Indian food in New York, hands down
The waiters are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you
The food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly
My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we've always been given the highest service and often free desserts
If you're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good service, definitely visit Curry Leaf
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan
MMmmm
it was delicious
Service was slow, but the people were friendly
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation
I can't wait to go back
Me and my girlfriend had dinner their about two weeks ago
It was great food
Started off with a nice tall bombay beer
I recommend the Shami Kabob appetizers
Their two round friend lamb kabobs
Throw alittle mint chutney on them, and coulda swore that my mom was in the kitchen cooking them up
For dinner I got their sampler platter
(look for it its not that noticeable on the menu) I got daal, and chicken tikka, tandoori chicken, lamb vindaloo, with some other masalas and rice and bread
They also offer a strictly vegetarian sampler
If you like good Indian food, it definetely worth stopping by
Excellent lunch buffet for only $6
95
We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied
The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available
Just remember not to wear your best clothes b/c you'll come out smelling like Indian food
but it's well worth it!
Great Indian food and the service is incredible
The owner truly caters to all your needs
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them
Everyone was more then happy with his choices
Great food and the prices are very reasonable
Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet
Stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint)
Prix fixe lunch comes with entree, nan/ roti and basmati rice - a good deal for $6
You're be paying twice for the same option during dinner
My wife and I love us some Dakshin
Chicken Korma to die for, and also anything tandoori
Service is always excellent, and attentive
Get yourself a tallboy Kingfisher with your meal!
I highly recommend this gem! THe service is always outstanding, the seafood is always fresh and carefully prepared
I love the grilled calamari and octopus salad!! Must also have the Dalga salad
If you want simple fresh and carefully prepard seafood - look no further!
I highly recommend this great seafood restaurant
Fish they serve is fresh and delicious
Service is very good
The decoration was made thoughtfully
It's not a roomy restaurant
It's kind of small, but again, it feels good to sit there, eat freash and simple seafood, and enjoy the ambiance
I especially recommend anchovies!
Dalga has the most amazing fresh fish
I have become obsessed with the grilled calamari salad, which is delicious and alway served graciously by their outstanding servers
this is my favorite sushi (besides madybe blue ribbon) in the city
The food is always fresh and the staff great
Great space too
The last time I was there we had their hommade tofu which was so so good
I remember going to EN in the west village because they were supposed to be known for their tofu (and it was great), but Ebisu's was just as good
I'm reluctan to write this review because it's never too busy and we always get sat right away, but more people need to experience how great Ebisu is
EBISU always has fresh fresh fresh food
Especialy SUSHI is Marvelous
And waite staff is friendly and outstanding in service
This is the one
Ebisu is a toned down mellow place
Its not overpriced like a lot of other japanese restuarants and you can always expect fresh, delicious food

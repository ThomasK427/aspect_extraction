Staff/manager lied through their teeth the whole night
No A/C, charged others $10 or $20 for entry when they promised everyone on the guestlist would be comped all night, others were turned away, small venue, long lines for the bathroom, expensive drinks
Tries to pretend to be an exclusive club, when it is a lounge w/no caberat license
Only good thing about this place is the dj/music and the decor
Compared to NYC standards, it falls below avg, especially the food
This place is not going to last very long b/c their are other better places that are worth paying $ for admission
I regret not moving the party somewhere else down the street such as Duvet or Taj
Anywhere would have been better!
In the beginning it was pretty good
nice ambience, good drinks, good food and service
And then Bam! all of sudden karaoke started
I did read all the review and info about this place, it didn't say anything about karaoke
I was enjoying the ambience and having a quiet conversation w/ my friend, and then we started laughing, interrupted by loud singing voice over our heads!
out of surprise and awkwardness, we left right after
The whole good impression collapsed in a second
If you want to mix good ambience with some cheesy karaoke, this is the place to go, OR go there early and leave before it starts
This place doesn't know how to establish its own personality
I found the food at Via unremarkable, and overpriced, and the service was terrible
The waitress was inattentive and unpleasant
My group did not experience any of these complimentary drinks of which the other reviewers speak
I do not recommend Via at all
Had my b-day dinner here
Service was good, they tried to make us happy
It took them a while to figure out how to separate the checks though
The food is good
I really enjoyed it
The only thing I had a problem with is the appetitizer called Assaggi
There was no price on the menu and the waitress recommended it
I figured it wouldn't cost that much, comparing to the price of the other items on the menu, but it was $65
I can't even imagine appetitizers costing that much
Dang
Just to let you know, we didn't get any free shots
My birthday at Via was a great experience
The manager promised my party a table and bottle service and took care of it immediately as we all arrived
The owner approached me and got us a round of shots
Overall everything was very accomodating
I'll definitely try the food soon
Via not only has a great variety of food, but at phenomenal price! Me and 11 of my friends went here for my birthday and had 4 bottles of wine, appetizers, main courses, and desserts and each paid no more than $35
Our waiter was very attentive and kept bringing us free rounds of shots
And once the bill was paid, the bartender kept on giving us drinks
They really make the extra effort to make someone's special day that much better!
Its a total hot box in there!!! There is no air and everyone around you is sweating and complaining about the heat
It is a very uncomforatable place to be
The best new restaurant lounge I've been to in a while
Great hot spot in trendy Flatiron area
The DJ keep the crowd into it all night
Service is top-level
The place was beautiful
I will definitely be back to try the food
I came to Via for a freinds birthday party and I was really impressed! The service was excellent, the brick oven pizza was phenomenal, and the Pomegranate Martini was to die for!! On top of that, one of the owners brought a cake sampling to the table and helped sing happy birthday! I would highly recommend this space and am definately coming again!!
Dined at 24 Prince in the backyard garden
Very easygoing atmosphere
Food was very good with basic American comfort food dishes on the menu
It was a perfect meal for July 4th
The wait staff came by to check on us several times without being intrusive
The price is VERY reasonable for what you get
I would definitely return to 24 Prince
Great date place, too
If you're into very good quality food at a reasonable price, this is for you
If you're into people watching and pretense, head elsewhere
Came by last week with my girls, going by a recommendation
Lunch was great
It was hot out and the last thing we wanted was patio dining
We get there, and we were given options on where we wanted to sit
Well, I take my words back on the patio
There, we felt like we were not in SoHo
It was so relaxing, and it was cool and quiet
We spent almost 2 hours there
The menu is simple, yet tasty
The Salads are full of flavor, and big in portions
With my girls in tow, we practically tried everything on their menu, and we all agreed that we definitely will be back
Our recommendation is positive, and highly recommended
I have been coming here for a long time and I frequently browse this site to checkout other restaurants to try
I noticed some of the listings for 24 prince
I had heard the opening chef left several months ago also but for the past few months the food has been as good if not better (there are many new additions)
It has not skipped a beat
The backyard is great although it could have a bit more lighting
I highly recommend this restaurant to any new readers
There is not a better value in the city
I thought the atmosphere was really chic and the food was really good for the price and the type of food it is
It's not just boring regular old american food, these dishes have a twist to them that you don't find too often
The wine list had some great options on it too and the outside garden in the back is perfect for hot summer nights in Soho!
I went here recently and though it is not that expensive - 2 dinners, a bottle of wine and a dessert came to just under $60 - I wouldn't go back
The dinner portions were so small that you left still feeling hungry
The food was nothing special
The desserts were even tinier, -and- they put balsamic vinegar instead of chocolate on top of my chocolate cake! Fortunately the waitress was very ncie about this, and did not give me a hassle about taking the cake off the final bill
Still, I'd rather wait at Habana then go here again
I went here on a Thursday night with a friend and had a nice leisurely meal
Our waitress wasn't the friendliest, but we never felt rushed
I had the meatloaf with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans and a glass of wine and after-dinner coffee and yy friend had the mac and cheese, wine, and coffee
We both enjoyed our food and the bill was $50 plus tip
Dining at 24 Prince on a busy Thursday night, my friend and I were frankly appalled at the food we were served
Not only was the flavor of the food mediocre at best, but the culinary choices made by the chef are just plain wrong-headed
The steak in the steak frites was flavorless and the bernaise sauce served with it equally flavorless
The fingerling potato chips in the fish and chips are not fries as they should be, but a poor attempt at american-style thin chips, bland and soggy
The most confusing bit of the dinner was the taco-shell bowl on which our ceasar salads were served which tasted disturbingly like Doritos
One of the worst meals I've ever had
We will not be back
I went to my friends bday dinner last weekend at 24 Prince in the downstairs private room
It could not have worked out any better

It was so awful
Their fries suck compared to the cottage fried at JG Melon's
I've been going to JG Melon's for years and love it! They have the best burgers, cottage fries and bloody marys anywhere
hands down!!!
Best Burger in NYC, also wonderful cottage fries
Old time tavern is charming
Small, traditional, teriffic 'bar' ambiance, packed with fine upper east side people -- I ran into Mayor Bloomberg there one night with his girlfriend
The CEO of a giant cable network
Robin Byrd, once, too
I'm told one of the bartenders is the father of a famous movie star
Everybody is so nice and pleasant, erudite and talkative, it's just great
And, oh yeah -- best hamburger in the world, in my estimation
Can't tell you about the rest of the food as I have been there a hundred times and never eaten anything except the burger
And the whole place is ridiculously inexpensive for this neighborhood
Too big, no flavor
I don't see what all the fuss is about
Overrated
The burgers here are amazing
I would recommend this place to all of my friends
Having to wait a few minutes for a small table is worth the relaxed atmosphere and food
This quaint Upper East side burger and fries specialist
Locals swear by it
Our group concurred
Small place with Burgers like home
Great place
You have to try
The person above who reviewed the burger as bad and stringy must be a total idiot
This is one of the best places in New York
The burger is fantastic as are the salads, the fries, the bloody marys and the atmosphere which harkens back to a better New York
Anyone who does not like it is an angry person who is not likely to like anything including themselves
i had a burger here last night because of all the great reviews i've read
the meat was stringy and chewy and nearly inedible
the only flavor the burger had was on the outside, where it seemed to have been deep-fat fried
i think i had better burgers in the lunch line in elementary school
save yourself the disappointment, and don't even bother with this place
I was anxious to try JG Melon after I heard that it had the best burgers in the city and I would have to agree
The burger was cooked to perfection and the portion sizes were perfect! The cottage fries are also amazing and they are very fresh and easily addicting
The restaurant is small and it is popular so go early to avoid a wait, but it is well worth the wait if you are a hamburger lover!
This Upper East Side staple is busy
All the time
It can be intimidating at first, but once you snuggle up to the bar, while waiting for your table, it feels like home
A home filled with I-bankers, but home nonetheless
The key here is to understanding that you need to eat and get out
Have a great burger and cottage fries
Pay the man and leave
It's crowded and if you want to get a table, you wish they would just eat and leave
Oh, and try the Bull Shot
It's a variation on the Bloody Mary, with beef bullion
Sounds gross, but spicy and tasty
The burgers were small, but delicious
Match it up with some chili and you're good to go
What the place lacks in service, it makes up for in food
Stopped in for late lunch and had a great burger! The service was extremely unfriendly as if we were bothering her with our request for food and drink at a restaurant! You would have thought we'd asked for her firstborn child! Wow! Sorry to interrupt your nap,but the cooks are great-eat a burger! Nice outdoor seating as well
I had been a regualr a corner since I live downtown but I was up visiting a friend so figured I would give mellons a try-it was a nice place, good service, nice people, the burger was almost as good but the fries are the wavy disk type which can be good but need to be well done -would go back but not make the trip specifically- btw very upper east side place (for better or worse)
The menu here is limited, good burgers but that's about it! The food is average
I have never been disappointed with JG Melon
The burgers are delicious -- fresh, juicy and flavorful
The cottage fries are also delicious
I always start with a salad and then move on to a bacon cheeseburger and fries
I have never tried the chili, although I have heard great things about it
The service is a bit hurried, but you do get your order fairly quickly, as they clearly like to turn the tables over
The good news is that they are successful enough that they can afford to charge very reasonable prices
Quite frankly, JG Melon is one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan, and it's not expensive at all
The bar is also a fun place to come and meet friends or watch a sporting event
The burgers here are the best in the City
And the fries are amazing, too
Pair is with a spicy Bloody Bull and you've got a perfect meal
For non-beef eaters, try the turkey club or turkey burger
This is a great neighborhood place with lots of atmosphere
The bar scene is fun which helps because there's usually a wait to get in
All I heard about from a number of people was how great a burger one can find at JG Melon
So, one evening, in dire need of the best burger possible, I sing the second-hand praises of this joint to my companion and drag him up there
Thin, flat, dry burger on a thin, wonder-bready bun, with a limp pickle and some wilted lettuce and mealy tomato
Nasty
The fries are half-decent, but that's as far as I'll go with compliments
The ambiance sucks, too
I have been going to Melon's for my entire life, and believe me, these ARE the best burgers in the City
So good, in fact, that no one can resist their gerasy charms
Only at Melon's can you see a 70-something socialite take off her diamonds and pearls to scarf a juicy bacon cheeseburger and the amazing cattage fries! One of NY's finest establishments, it is well worth the wait
an execellent place to be and eat with anyone
I recommend it to anyone looking for a good relaxing environment
The Upper East Side graduates the next gereration Greenwich CT residents from this old Preppy bar with all kinds of charm
Always crowned and mildly friendly this place is one that could be called home
well maybe one a week
Great food including burgers, steak tartar and everything that is bad for us
No fluff and not trendy
wood, noise, beer, meat and loafers
Works for me
It's true! Whatever you've heard is true

Melon has one of the biggest, juciest burgers in the city
But, the little tiny area you are provided to eat it in and the realtively large prices you're going to pay for it might send you elsewhere for your fix
Very good Burgers
Very tight to sit
They really cram in the people but worth it Strange crowd
ALot of upscale white people but great food service is ok
So the staff might be a bit scratchy from time to time, but they're fair, and once you're seated and move on to the second tier, the service is fast and happy
The crowd is always diverse, the atmosphere is buzzy and convivial, the prices are to die for in the neighbourhood, yet none of this even compares to the burgers themselves
Without fail, hands down, no peer best burgers in Manhattan

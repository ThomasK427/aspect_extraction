I've eaten in both the Westside and Eastside restaurants once but have ordered take out from both places often
The resturants are both noisy are a great place to watch sports
I've ordered take out often
The Amsterdam restaurant consistently leaves parts of the order out
They readily give credits
Despite the corny Christmas lights and the really really loud bar crowd, Jimmy's got the best ribs in NY - the dry rub are fantastic
The swamp water leaves you wishing to take a trip to the bayou to have some genuine swamp water
This is to get some decent BBQ and a good place to watch a game
It's a big ACC bar durin college football and basketball days
Even southern boys can feel some love in NYC
Ribs and wings were pretty good, but a little small
Service is questionable
i've been going here for years, and the food has always been a highlight, always
yet something has changed in the last year
the food has gone sharply downhill
what used to be a place that served some very good south for your mouth is serving mass produced southern fare, with no local flavor or uniqueness
i would have bet my last dollar that the chicken fried steak i ordered ate had been in the freezer not 30mins before
i got a big grilled chicken salad with ranch that had ranch that tasted like literally nothing
that and a lot of the other dishes have for some reason gone very south, no pun intended
it's a huge disappointment
what used to be a place of great comfort food is now just like any other mass produced semi-chain
it's a shame, it used to be so good
This place is a home away from home for ACC SEC transplants
Your school's pennant will likely adorn the walls - I see Clemson's every time I visit! I have been to the Upper West Side (Amsterdam 80 something?) and Upper East Side (2nd Avenue 92?) locations several times each, and have never been disappointed in the waitresses' abilities to bring me frequent drinks with smiles, and the cooks to prepare authentic southern BBQ ribs and sandwiches
And all this at somewhere between Southern prices and NYC prices
fortunately a little closer to Southern
During football season, you can reserve tables or rooms, and if you have the numbers a little Southern courtesy, you can watch your team's game
Their food drink specials make it really inexpensive sometimes, the website is great, and they email you when they do something special
Brother Jimmys is a taste of the south right in NYC
go here to watch ACC college hoops or March Madness
guaranteed to meet other die-hard hoops fans
also they have great southern BBQ and great drinks such as Trash Can Punch
i was here three times since i rated the place in dec
and this place has fallen off
Ladies one the hot bartenders are gone, two the food is awful , three WHERE WAS ALL THAT FUN, and finally i do not know now who is more stuck up the bartenders on the westside one or the one on the eastside where we went last weekend and they have male bartenders that think there hot but there not, but want to say thanks to Tom
My husband and I were very dissappointed with our visit yesterday
Being from the South,an NC, my husband said the ribs were nothing like he had ever tasred,and were awful
The wait staff was more concerned with being Hooter wannabes, than waiting on customer
The bus boys were actually more attentive
Need to go back to drawing board
service use to be very good and fast
i sat and waitted for 20 minutes for food order
the girls were just hang out and talking to each other
what is up with the cheesey guy behind the bar i ordered a bud and he begins to flex and say bottle or draft are you kidding me
thought this was a geat br but i guess it isn't
last weekend and me and my my girlfriends were so bored with the place
the bartender took FOREVERRRR to get use a drink
the place was not that crowded or even if you can call it a crowd
someof my other girlfriends told my the same thing about jimmys a couple of weeks ago but they thought it was an off night, PLEASE do something to make it better
SO ANYWAY! i want to say i love your bar
thanks to the cute bartender for introducing my to some of the best guys i have ever meet in the bar
last night was great
This bar may boast being Southern and it is in theory but the food isnt too Southern
The Sweat Tea is good but not as good
The hushpuppies are mediocre
However, it is a great place to get some wings, beer and watch a Football or BBall game containing a Southern team
A downhome put some south in your mouth place
The daily specials cann't be beat pitchers and wings
pitchers and ribs, etc
Good prices, nice atmosphere a great place
The best all you can eat beer and wings ever! Come here for Monday night football and see how much you can put away
Ohh, did I mention that they also give you pork tips too! Great Food, Great Bear, Great Fun!
me and my girlfriends were there a couple of weeks ago and we danced on the bar and had a great time
your bartenders were probably the hottest two male bartenders in the city
we went by a couple of days ago and only one was working and we did not have as much fun
i hope the work together again
can you let us know when they work
there are sooo hot
love stephanie
yo i went to fsu and i love your place
been coming here sine i graduated in dec
waitresses are hot and there all pretty much awsome
love the energy from everyone in there especially from the bartenders there great
the girls are hot and the chemicals brothers have a blast
can't wait for football there i heard it is crazy wings and beer me and my froends are there
The Scene Confident, straightforward and comfortable, it's the kind of restaurant that feels like it's been around for decades
The mood is as robust as the signature two-olive martinis that typically begin meals
Red-leather banquettes and dark woods give the dining room the air of an Ivy League supper club--few restaurants in Manhattan scream louder for blue blazers and slacks
The Food Chef-owner Tom Valenti's food makes just as much noise; he cooks in a masculine, big-flavored, meat-and-potatoes style, rich with terrines, mustards, eggs and bitter greens
A bedrock understanding of good cooking underlies every dish: smoked duck breast is ignited by a sharp salt-and-pepper crackle and an oozing egg; juicy slabs of pork loin are wrapped in crisp bacon; perfect foie gras agnolotti is set off by oniony leeks
I have been eating at Ouest since it opened
Unfortunately, I live one block away
I've sampled almost everything on the menu and have never had a bad meal
It's a very attractive, cool setting
A small, popular bar at the front (with excellent bartenders) then a long hallway leads to the main dining room
Two smaller areas are tucked away on an open second level (good for celebs who need to hide)
An open kitchen completes the warm, open feeling
The place and the food are mature and adult, not kitschy or trendy
On a crowded night (usually every night) it can get a bit noisy, especially if you are seated at the side tables
(If you're a table of 4 and want to easily converse try requesting one of the hallway booths
) Although the menu has changed a bit over time, the quality of food and service has not
It's top notch
Wonderful wine list
The menu has just enough to satisfy any diner
A recent visit included the sturgeon appetizer (a signature dish), the arctic char entree (cooked to perfection) and the simple grilled tuna (which contrary to the name was full of flavor and appeal)
Along with 2 drinks and 2 cappucinos the meal clocked in at $110
If money (and my waist) were no object I would eat here every night
Ouest is one of the best restaurants on the Upper West side! Always full but always peacfull, this beautiful American style cuisine is just top notch
Great waitstaff
Try the goat cheese ravioli!!! MMMM!!!!

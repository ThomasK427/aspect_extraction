Walked by on a Sunday morn, ordered a b'fast sandwich with baby spinach, onions, egg whites
What a deal!
it was huge!
and then I decided at the last minute to add on a sweet
it was the best cheese danish ever!
Anyone from NYC probably won't appreciate the deli feeling as one should
It's more than food
It's the people, the ambiance, the interaction and the scene
This is one of those places that makes you want to think about New York, immigrants, the typical glorifying of the blue collar worker and the hardhats
Here you can almost participate in the play,without having to stay -you're a guest
This place got it
I love it
Don't count on them to actually get you your order or even let you know if it's not coming
We ordered a pizza and waited
and waited
After over an hour, we called them to ask on the status
Turns out the delivery guy couldn't find us (they'd delivered to us before without a problem) and, according to the guy on the phone, the delivery guy brought the pizza back all messed up
He didn't offer to send another one out or even that one - he just said I don't know what to tell you and suggested we order from someone else
We always tip really well, don't know why they treated us so badly
The pizza is also really greasy and not worth the money - you could do better - but no pizza at all after an hour's wait - you could do MUCH better
This place had been around for more than 20 years
My husband and I love this place for their vestede sandwiches (spleen with ricotta and another imported cheese), spaghetti w/ calamari, the pizza topped wit breadcrumbs and anchovies, seafood salad, rice balls, stuffed eggplant and other Sicialian specialties
You will only find these vestede sandwiches at this place and Sicily
They're very good and very rare! The old La Foccaceria was strictly Italian before but when they re-opened,they mixed Mexican menu for even more variety
Recommending Guacamole a La Mesa, sangria and their quesadillas
This place knows how to really serve great food! The prices are reasonable and the food is very satisfying!
All of the entree's at LA F
are tasty and delicious
I like the mussels, any of the veal dishes, the calimari, and chicken picata
You pretty much can't go wrong here
There is basically no ambiance but you make up for that with the prices
The house wine used to be solid but the last time it was substandard so maybe order a beer
When I lived in Manhattan it was a treat to go to the La Foccaceria
I used to get a cheese sandwich (I could never spell it!) It was so good
I don't get into Manhattan that often but when I do I make a special trip to La Foccaceria
The cheese sandwich is still on the menu and is just as good as when I was a kid
Besides the sandwich the other food is great
I had a bowl of lentel soup, and then a dish of tripe, ans a Manhattan Special to wash it all down
Everything I had was out of this world
My mouth is watering just thinking of it
If you ever get a chance to eat there you won't be dissappointed
The place is not fancy, but let me tell you the food is very very good

This East Village Bistro accents the Veruca Salt ideal of America
Typical of meat and potatoes that fuel obesity of New York
you can always enjoy a nice walk around the chic boutiques to burn those extra calories
Potato pate is extra eccentric with its beef flavoring

This McDonald's is in a unique stretch of 1st Avenue in the East Village- loaded with great, independent bars and restaurants
So McD's has hung a massive multi-story billboard above its entrance to make it stand out
The feel of this stretch of street is destroyed by the obnoxious facade, and I urge folks to get better food from one of the great local restaurants surrounding this neon monster
The Scene Cooing couples find some formality and open air up in the front room, while the subterranean back area offers hunkered-down seating for loungier dining
Local DJs provide a consistently funky yet mellow soundtrack for the experience
Be warned: Il Bagatto is no secret, and reservations are tight
The downstairs bar softens early arrivals
The Food This rustic Italian menu runs the gamut from homemade pappardelle to gorgeously braised meats
Openers include fagioli with tomato and shallot, sauteed spinach leaves with garlic, sprightly salads and ripe tomato-topped bruscetta
Savory homemade pastas dominate the appetizers, while main courses include tantalizing roasted chicken and sauteed veal
The revolving specials menu is in a menu in itself
This is my go to spot for Italian
The specials always impress
They take reservations unlike many of the other great EV Italian spots
Avoid this place at all cost unless you have a high tolerance for rude behavior from the host and all the time to wait to get seated
I went with my friends last friday and was told to wait for 25 to 40 minutes to get seated
I enquired the status after about 45 minutes and was told to wait another 20 minutes
The third time, after, an hour and a half of waiting, my friend went up to the host to check the status
The host's response to my friend was extremely rude and told her that he was tired of dealing with us and will not serve us
He ruined our friday evening
Will never go back again
CLOSE DOWN IL BAGATTO!!  BEWARE!! The owner and hostess are truly obnoxious
They usually accept your name on the guest promise seating in 45 minutes to an hour
After 2 hour long waits, if you politely ask them when you could get the promised table, the owner/host is VERY RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS, uses ABUSIVE LANGUAGE
, will refuse to give you a table and tell you to GET OUT GET OUT AND LEAVE HUNGRY he said
The restaurant does not deserve any rating, food aside
REFUSE TO EAT HERE TILL THERE IS A CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT
NEW YORKERS DESERVE BETTER!
Went there on a Friday night
was very impressed with the place
The crowd is mostly people in their mid 20's to early 30's
Very crowded and a little noisy, but it was a Friday night
The host there was very courteous, the same goes for the staff
Menu is smaller than some other restaurants, but anything that you choose would be excellent! I read some of the negative reviews here and got nervous
they are all NOT true! Nice bar area downstairs as well
Would recommend for a date night
Wine menu is extensive, many bottles under $40
Bottom line, you want excellent, tasty, affordable italian food, go here

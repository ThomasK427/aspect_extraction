The food is superb, the best in the city
Hats off to Steve the Chef, he puts it all together and knows what he is doing
It is a nice feeling to recommend Triomphe to others and entertain people there and know everyone finishes dinner with the same feeling - Excellent - right down to dessert
I can't wait to go back
This restaurant is near where I work and is great for small gatherings
However, if you are looking for a table of 6 or more the service seems to suffer
All of our appetizers and entress arrived to the wrong person and at different times
We had to hunt our server down when an entree not ordered arrived
If you are looking for solid good French cusine in a cozy atmosphere than this is the place!
A wonderful dinner
my companion had the seared corriander crusted grilled lamb rack in a port reduction with foie stuffed prunes and I had the buttermilk battered Atlantic cod fish
We were blown away by the taste of each dish
perfection
For dessert, we shared a wonderful blueberry pudding type cake(?), which, was equally impressive
The ambience, the service, and the food achieve a simple elegance
You won't find the forced mixing of as many exotic ingredients as possible that seems to be a competitive sport among chefs in trendy restaurants
You will find fresh, innovative flavors, and perfect preparations
The chicken is a rich delight
The sea bass is tangy and fresh
The filet is nearly fork-tender
The chef gets that perfect crisp-outside, juicy-inside taste with uncanny precision, and gives a pleasant flavor surprise in the seemingly simplest dishes
We have been to Triomphe several times in the last year
It's one of our favorites
The specials are always creative and they have a great wine list
Actually, I'd like to keep it a secret
An excellent pre-theater restaraunt
Great execution of classic cuisine with a contemporary flair
I went before the theater last friday and was so suprised what a great dinner I had
Everything was great from the amazing scallops to the friendly and curtious service
One of the best meals in NYC
I highly recomend Triomphe
Wanted to treat my bf to a nice dinner a broadway show for our anniversary
Decided on Triomphe b/c it was close to the theatre and it also got good reviews on citysearch and they weren't wrong! We got there a bit early and the staff wasn't ready for us but we didn't mind b/c we got to wait by the beautiful bar
The room is small and intimate, which was really nice for us and our waitor was so nice
I had the veal cutlet and it was amazing
I could taste each flavor one at a time in my mouth
My bf had the filet mignon quail (appetizer)
We ended the meal with carrot cake
The bread at the beginning came with butter rolled in herbs and that was so different and so good! Definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice night out
I was impressed!
This is my all time favorite restaurant to bring friends, family, and business clients! The staff, ambiance, and food are amazing! Their Tasting Menu is one of the best! Chef Steve is a gracious hostess and all around nice guy! Everything from the seafood, to the warm bread, to the Foie Gras, to the lamb is fresh, seasoned well and gorgeously presented
We dined at Triomphe on March 26, 2004 before attending a show
The three of us all loved the experience
The decor is muted and tasteful
Our waiter was informed and professional
The orange infused Martini I had was delicious
All 3 of us had fish dishes - I had the sole which was heavenly and my wife and cousin enjoyed the sea bass
The quality and presentation were flawless
We did not feel rushed although we had to make an 8:00 pm curtain
The restaurant is small and intimate and a perfect place for a romantic dinner
Definately come to this place for an out the way elegant experience
The waitstaff is great and the food is excellent
They have a private room that has a fireplace and holds up to 20 people
Dinner for 2 came out to about $125
Don't miss out
If you are going to the theater you MUST GO HERE!!! Gorgeous tiny little room
Quite romantic
A menu that blows my mind
The scallops with foi gras
WOW!! Is the chef single???? The service is friendly but not obtrusive
It is a bit of a sleeper after the theater rush goes through, so if you are looking for a place that's pumping this isn't it, but if you want an elegant, charming, adult meal this is a definate hit!!!
In Short Eatery's design is spare: High white ceilings, a cement floor and green banquettes
A small, well-populated bar sits off to the side
The New American menu is well-suited for snacking
Comfort foods abound, with dishes like baked macaroni and cheese, jerk chicken with mashed sweet potatoes, garlic roast chicken and a chili-rubbed pork chop with polenta
Desserts include cheesecake, warm chocolate cake and an ice cream sandwich with whipped cream
Eatery was great in every aspect
The food was really good, the Asian Chicken Salad is as good as people say
The Macaroni and Cheese was delicous, as was the seared tuna
The service was really good and we were seated immediately after arriving
Their drinks were good and desert was pretty good, although the chocolate banana egg roll was a dissapointment
I walk by eatery on my way to work every day, and finally found the time to try them out for dinner last night
All I have to say, is it was the best experience that I've had in a restaurant in a very long time
My job requires me to wine and dine my clients on a frequent enough basis, and I think I've finally found the perfect place to do it
Upscale, but casual, a great quality at an affordable place, in a generally unpretentious setting
After my friend and I were seated, we were greeted by a gorgeous waitress, who helped us make our way through the large selection of choices on the menu
She did a great job at recommending food and wine, and she kept us entertained with her fun personality
I had the tequila shrimp as an entree and it was delicious! Perfectly cooked, great portions
Everyone around me (including the staff) seemed to be having a great time
I certainly got my money and time's worth and I will not hesitate to dine at Eatery again
Eatery has long been one of my favorite spots for dinner, but being summer and all I hadn't been by recently
Was I ever surprised when I went by for dinner this week! They expanded the seating with a cozy new back section, added some great new dishes (I had the most fantastic j erk Shrimp and exciting maize crusted salmon) but kept everything that was good (amazing staff and Mac Jack!) My friends and I had a great time - the atmosphere was exciting but didn't encroach on us while we had our meal and drinks (which is better, the kiwitini or the watermelon martini?) Our waiter was so personable, explained everything for us and kept us entertained
This place is definitely addictive!
A bunch of my girlfriends and I were craving a hearty, fun-filled brunch after a late night on the town
We couldn't think of a better place then the Eatery
We walked into eager, hungry crowds and couldn't wait for our name to be called! The turnover was fast and we grabbed our Bellini's and headed to our cute new booth
As soon as we got our menu i knew i was going to have a hard time deciding if i wanted the eggs benidict, or better known as their famous E-Benne or the scrumptious Stuffed French Toast, i can never decide - Salty or Sweet? We were all tossing and turning so we decided to order a lot of everything and split it! (The only way to go)
This restaurant was perfect, a high paced, yet personal atmosphere where the servers where bubbly and ready to help our undeciding manner
I can't think of a better place to hang out with your gals, or maybe for others get together with family be it old or young
Price range is reasonable and quality is spectacular
I can't wait to come here for dinner, and give that menu a whirl! All i can say is my stomach was very satisfied!
After having a baby this was our first night out in months
Me and my husband we both loved Eatery
The food was great, the service outstanding
The atmosphere is just WOW! I will recommend it to all our friends
We can't wait to go back
Somebody recomended this place and I thought why not try it?
I'm glad I did
Great food,I had the steak, it was perfect
My friend had the ravioli and she loved it, the waiter was funny and helpful made the evening interesting

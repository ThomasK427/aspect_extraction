my boyfriend and i have had several great dinner dates here over the last year or so
we just had another one this past saturday
the food was amazing as always, and the sake was quite smooth
my favorite has to be the chinese sausage and sticky rice plate
cant wait for the next time
Man ! This place just does not disappoint !! Open for over one year, the atmosphere, service and food has not faltered in any way shape or form
A great date place and fun with groups as well
Still a good looking hot spot where the food is delicious, the drinks are great and music is fun
I recommend making a reservation even for two, as the place can fill up fast! Tapas do mean small plates so make sure you have enough cash left over to get home ! I need to go more often to try the specials
I rarely meet a restaurant that I don't plan to return to, but unfortunately Kuma fits into that category
The service and the fun atmosphere were wonderful
However, the prices of the dishes (about $8 each) are not justified by their quality nor their portions
Two of us ordered 6 dishes, as they recommend, and by the end of our meal, I felt as if I had just finished eating an hors d'oeuvre course
I am not kidding! Each plate can be finished off in 3 bites
I personally would have had to order 6 dishes to satiate my hunger, and like another reviewer, chose to finish dinner at the crperie nearby
I'm now obsessed with King's food
I want everyone to know that I don't eat meat, and full on licked the pork sauce off the plate
I could eat it every night for dinner and think about it all the time
Toast the chef and say thank u when u sit down because u and your tummy are going to love him when you are done!
I love everything here, the thai chili sauce is the best condiment ever! I want to put it on everything King serves
most items do not need anything extra, but the chili sauce is that good! Always order any vegetable dishes and the grilled baby octopus is amazing- His omelets are so not your normal egginess, but a taste and texture explosion! Enjoy and go often
This restaurant was wonderful! I went with a few friends after work and it was just the place! All the dishes we tried were delicious, but I think my favorite was the tuna tartare
The service was also excellent
I will be going back again!
I'd recommend Kuma Inn for couples and small groups
The small dining room has the ambience of a living room
The portions are indeed small, but well made and well presented
Especially good is the Hawaiian tuna and scallops
The rice is definately overpriced though
There are not many filipino restaurants in the Manhattan
(You'd have to go to the other boroughs for that
) In fact you can probably count on one hand the number of Filipino restaurants in the city
The addition of Kuma Inn, I hope, will finally bring Filipino cuisine to the forefront
If one must talk of Asian fusion, then one should look no further than Kuma Inn
It's great! How many places in Manhattan can you eat your food with a bottle of San Miguel? It's Filipino food done well and imaginatively!
kuma inn, a door down from suba, is a wonderful little surprise
reservations may be hard to come by because its so small
but its worth it
the ambience is lovely, the sake tasting definitely recommended (great portions, perfect to get you in the mood for the rest of the evening out)
the food could be better and the portions a little bigger, because you are definitely left wanting for more
but then again, if you plan on going out afterwards its probably just right
the crab cakes, pork and tuna tartare were very good
all in all, i rate it pretty highly and would take an out of town friend there to show them the under stated chic side of new york
Okay, so it's asian tapas
The food was okay, but nothing special
I think a really good Thai place or Filipino food place is better
The quality vs value proposition for this place just didn't make sense
After you order 4 plates of food, which turn out to have 3 or 4 pieces each, you are left with a bill which would have given you a full meal elsewhere
After our group ate here, we had to go to Taco Bell and a creperie to avoid pangs of hunger
Walking up the stairs and finding this hidden restaurant is like discovering a gem
Vibrant Southeast Asian flavor, fusion Filipino and Thai, accented with East Asian preparation
We ordered grilled pork, slightly sweet and tangy withachara, pickled vegetables that blended perfectly with the pork! Perfect with the Filipino garlic fried rice garnished with scallions
The Chinese sausage dish presented with Japanese style triangle-shaped rice garnished with black toasted sesame on top was delish
Excellent presentation
San Miguel beer, a Filipino beer, complemented the food well, stronger than a Sapporo
I haven't tried the desserts yet, but the mango ice cream sounded good to me
Worth it for the flavor and ambience
Friendly chef and waiters
Cozy (small, but comfortable space), clean, ethnic minimalist decor--lots of wood
If you are looking exquisite quality food and flavor, this is not the place for you
The salmon dish I ordered particularly disappointed me
High quality salmon has a multidimensional yet subtle taste; I got 3 oz of a very flat/farmed fish with too sweet of a glaze
I suppose it would be fair to say that everything I ordered tasted a little flat
There can be two reasons for this: either the goods were not as fresh as they should have been or the seasoning was off
I would like to assume the latter
My expectations were fairly high based on the comments of other people who came to the place
Honestly, I am quite skeptical of the palates of the previous reviewers
I would have been better off going to a real Japanese sake bar with more highly developed food pairings (and a knowledgeable staff)
by far the best new restaurant in the area and this includes the over hyped wd-50
every dish was superb
i'll be back
Recently dined @ Kuma with a group of 10
Staff was very accomodating
Service was adequate, considering the size of our group
Food was , but not out of this world
The laid back and friendly atmoshpere is the greater attraction for Kuma Inn
Once word about this place gets out, its going to be impossible to get a table in its tiny dining room, avoid the rush and get in now! The Asian tapas are the best way to eat, really fun for groups, and for the prices, the food was almost too good
The day I went the chef's mom was waiting on our table - this place is such an antidote to the shi-shi places in Soho, long live Kuma Inn!
Best hidden date place in the 'hood, to be sure
Don't go without the address written down
The food is asian-inspired-tapas and the superior sake/wine selection list is built to be a no brainer to match the food
It get's a little warm over by the open-kitchen area, but otherwise a foodies paradise
As with most asian inspired food, I favor the seafood dishes over the meats
but they're all good to be sure
I love this cute 2nd floor eatery, especially its name, which puns on the Filipino word kumain (to eat)
The staff is extremely warm and knowledgable, especially about the impeccably-served sake and surprisingly decent (tho' small) wine selection
My companions and I had a nice, inexpensive Riesling and a couple of icy Singha beers with our Filipino and Thai-inflected meals
Yummy dishes included a velvety, subtly spicy sole in coconut milk sauce, Filipino pork barbecue skewers and excellent Flip-style garlic fried rice
A good place for groups, but you'll need to be quick with the chopsticks because you'll all be fighting over the sole
(One thing--what's up with the chopsticks? Filipinos don't use them
and I didn't think Thais did either
)
Chef King is true to his name at this hidden LES gem
The tappas, sake, and awesome service make this a new favorite
Check out the cool bamboo art too!
Wonderful food and an excellent variety of sake! The friendliness and graciousness of Chef King will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy all over! Long live the King!
I went to this place when it first opened and since then I've been back three times! I especially love the seafood tapas and the sake drinks
All the dishes are fresh and creative
the chef even stops by to chat!
i've been there twice for the bagels

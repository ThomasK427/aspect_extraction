Since then, we've been back to try their regular menu and are just as impressed
Small intimate restaurant with excellent friendly service
All the dishes we had simple, well constructed favors (stuffed calamari with almonds, beet salad, orresheti (sp?) pasta with mixed sweet and spicy sausages, linguini with clams and leeks)
Deserts were fresh, interesting and homemade as well
Great, great, Italian wine list
Ask Vito to recommend a wine; he gave us several winers
Lovely! Greatest lamb of all times, superbe wine list (where do they keep it all?)
fantastic appetizers! They lowered their prices immensly, so that you practically get a bargain now (almost)
Alex and Vito are amazing hosts
Their staff is great too
Food and wine were delicious
Ambience: cozy, very romantic, great for wine and conversations
Don't leave without trying some of their dessert wines and their mocha cake--YUM!!! I'm not much of a wine person, but Vito (wine conniseur) has converted me
The best wine I've ever had! I'd highly recommend this place for that special occasion
The best service I've encountered in NYC
All of the necessary attributes for a romantic experience are not only present at Aroma, but handled to perfection
An intimate vibe, candle lit booths, expansive wine list, and a creative (not to mention delectable) menu lay the groundwork for a memorable evening
But what sets the restaurant apart is the feeling you get when you walk in; it's as though you've discovered a secret, intimate nook that nobody else knows about
It also doesn't hurt that the exceptional staff treats you like family, as owners Vito and Alexandra will make you feel like they are long lost cousins by the end of the night
i eat out in nyc all the time
and for a long time have thought that the city's best chefs begin their careers in the east and west village
that was true with the new famous chef at Veritas, Scott Bryant
Aroma has one of NYC's Top Chef;s and Alexandra and Vito make this one of my Top 15 Restaurants on this Island
bar none
Just sit at the bar and sip some amazing Italian wines
and have dinner by yourself if its a quiet evening
or grab 20 of your closest friends and head to their private wine cellar/ dining room
Aroma is what makes NYC such a great place to live//well done to Vito and Alexandra
Food was fresh yet dull, especially for the price ($12-14 appetizers; $22-$27 entrees)
We had asked for three flights of wine for about $15 each
We were offered to take three half bottles for about the same price
Were we floored when the billed came! We had orded two half bottles
One was $21 and the other was $42! The wine was good, though completely off the mark in what our server had described
Our duck was described as fall off the bone
We had to fight with it just to get some slices off
Of course we payed and tipped, but felt taken
Was it a horrible meal -- no
Was it worth the over $200 bill -- no
Was I satisfied -- no
Did I feel taken advantage of - YES
I had a wonderful culinary experience this Sunday at Aroma Restaurant
I come back from a ski trip in Colorado and i was hungry like a wolf
My friends took me to this lovely wine bar , where on Sunday they have a pre
fix menu
Incredible choices of wines, with caramelized onions bruschetta, pasta e fagioli, winter green salad, spaghetti polepettine, sicilian style meatloaf
Just incredibly good, i walked in barely standing, and come out feeling like a GOD
Alice and I stumbled upon this little pearl of a rest
Warm beets salad with gorgonzola delicious little balls
it's a genius idea, a savory sweet to start, I tasted my friend stuffed calamari and I could tell they where fresh and delicious
Some guy came to talk to us about the wines and he was genuinely excited ,we told him our budget and the wine was something i'm not going to remenber but deliciously different , and turned out to be cheaper
I had the most satisfying dish of lamb in a long time, the shoulder cake what a delicious idea with mush potato layer, Alicia went for the cod, crispy and great citrus flavor
Our bill was less then $ 150 with tip ,we had a great time, very good service a gracious host that showed us the downstairs with a communal table
Aroma we will be back
hopefully in the cellar
A foodie's delight--punches so far above it's weight (as a gustatory experience) that it is simply daunting to imagine how they have done it in only eight months and that they can do so and non-extortionate prices
The wine list is moderate in length, high in ambition and evolving
The hosts and owners are lovely, thoughtful and considerate!
We live in the neighborhood and eat at Aroma about once a week - the food is amazing (probably one of the top five meals I've had in my life)
The duck salad is out of this world and the lamb is superb
The owners, Alexandra and Vito treat us like family - they are really greats hosts
Make sure that you let Vito choose the wine for you - his choices are always spot on
Overall, I'd say this is my favorite restaurant in NYC at the moment - and I recommend it highly
The two bad reviews on this site are completely baseless - trust me, you'll love this gem of a restaurant
The other day a friend of mine took me to this little place down in the east village
I have to say ot was the best brunch I had in years
I had the salmon as an appetizer and the fontina omelette that it was to die for with a peach minosa
My friend had the polenta waffle and the melon prosciutto and it was also delicious
I will be back for more in the near future
We had a birthday party of 20+ the other weekend in their new private room
Alexandra and Vito were extraordinary hosts going out of their way to special order a case of our favorite wine, allow us to order from the full menu, and bake 2 fabulous birthday cakes
We had the room all night and enjoyed lingering well after the food was gone
All the food was wonderful, especially the duck salad, roast lamb, bolognese and tuna tartare special
Highly recommended for small or large parties if you are looking for gracious hosts, amazing food and of course fabulous wine
I can't say enough
Perfect food is hard to find but when a place is small, I've always found the food to be extra good and Aroma doesn't disappoint
From the Chef to the wait staff, you can tell they care
Wonder if the place was double in size if the food would still be excellent
What a great little find
Food was excellent and service was outstanding
Definitely recommend
My extra-picky friend I decided to try this place after seeing its profile on the food network, we're both so glad we did
Aroma is a tiny jewel, serving flavorful foods with impossibly warm smiles genuine gratitude for your business
My duck salad was savory and the chocolate ravioli intense, and my friend (who's rarely happy after a meal) kept saying how great the veal was, and what a wondeful meal in whole
A very wallet-friendly wine list completes the fantiastic dining experience
Although you're seating elbow-to-elbow, diners are all so happy, you easily make fast friends
Bravo Alex, Vitto Chris the chef
I'll return for to try the calamari!
Should be called Amore - because everything is done with love! The small cozy space presents a nice escape to the grind of the city
The service is personal and the wine selections excellent
Every course was delicious! I am anxious to return
Words cannot describe the flavors in these dishes- Straccetti Wild Mushroom Ragu, Graffiti Eggplant, Filleted Trout with polenta, fava beans and lemon sauce
WOW go and get a whiff for yourself
The ambiance is quaint, cozy, and warm and so are the hosts, Vito and Alexandra
They remembered me from the first time
Let them suggest some wines to pair with your food choices and you can't go wrong
The wine list is unusual and a refreshing twist from the typical Californian varieties seen everywhere else
This is a great spot whether to savor a full meal or to just sip some fine wines and nibble on aperitifs
What a gem on the lower east side
I'll be back for more and I mean that!
Stumbled on this little spot

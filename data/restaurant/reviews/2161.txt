Too good to be truth? go and experience it for yourself
you'll see yourself doing long commutes no matter where you are just to get a good zip of such excellent coffee
Trust me, I'm very picky when it comes to coffee and KEKO has just satisfied my most burning desire for the best coffee in Manhattan
I think worst part of all from this restaurant is the service
There were some food that tasted good but, most of all, taste of the food is below average
Waiter and Waitresses are like college students that they were more interested in tips then taking the orders quickly and serve the meals quickly
They were way too slow and the taste of food is so disappointing
This is the worst Japanese restaurant I ever been too
I think this is the reason why they didn't get 20% tips that I usually give
I gave a little over 10% for the tips
Even someone gives me a food certificate for the food, I don't think I will ever go back to that place again
I just ate at Restaurant Tokyo and the service was horrendous
It took them almost half an hour to get their attention to get our check, and when we tried to get the attention of a waitress, she rolled her eyes and rudely said one minute
Aside from that, the sushi tasted old as if it had been sitting out for a long time
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE
If you are looking for authentic Japanese restaurant, you have to go to Tokyo restaurant
Not to mention, sushi is not only Japanese dish
You wanna real Japanese cooking? Order today's special !! Trust me
FYI, they serve authentic suchi, too
I have been in New York City for 9 years now and this is the best pizza I have had anywhere in the City hands down
I agree with the previous reviewer
This pizza is fantastic! We order this pizza all the time at work, even though we are are 16 blocks north
It is that great
On top of the pizza being great, the prices are fantastic too! Skip the other pizza places when you are in this area and head right over to La Pizzeria! You will not be dissappointed
The baked ziti is great too!
Absolutely the best pizza in the area, if not in the city
Much better than any of the 'trendy' Murry Hill/Gramercy brick oven pizzerias
never have I seen a worse place for food or service it was terrible horrible miserable the food was lousy
We go here for lunch and love the pizza, the sauce is seasoned very nicely and the large slice is crisped to perfection
The people who work here are actually nice, service is wonderful and restaurant is kept clean
I like this pizza better than Bella Napoli and highly recommend it!
I got into Manhattan late after a flight from SFO
I was starving from the very limited amount now served on flights
The guys at the hotel recommended Imperial and they came to the rescue at my hotel at 12:30 am with a delicious, piping hot plate of chicken parmagiano + big ZD -- these baked rigatoni things
Recommended no-frills American-Italian for late night dinners in yoour midtown hotel room!
Great pizza!!!! Best we ever had
Excellent prompt late night delivery; even across town to midtown hotels
Definitely must try!
In Short The nondescript setting of this Italian institution may explain why deliverymen run back and forth transporting pies to midtown offices
The pizza is the specialty of the house, although there's an extensive menu of salads, pasta, chicken, veal and fish dishes
The pies belong to the thin, crisp-crust camp, and they arrive with fresh mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce and plenty of toppings (such as sun-dried tomatoes, pesto and zucchini)
We walked in to the place late after a weekday night of drinking
I asked them to bring our party of 4 their best pie
The guy told me to sit down and they would take care of us
We requested a good dry bottle of red, it wasn't great but the pizza was well worth it
They brought out the Grandma's square slice with fresh basil
it was AWESOME! We went back two more times that week!
best in the city no doubt and the grandma's square slice is even better then that
But the workers in there are rude and smack the pizza box down for no reason
Pizza is very good; the veal is excellent as is the penne bolognse
Go, this place does not miss
The pizza here is really great
I have my co-workers hooked on the pizza here -especially the sun dried tomato pizza
The sauce is sweet and the crust is delicious
goos pizza, and selection of pre made slices
Plenty of seating
Best pizza in the nabe
I ordered, hungry, from the office for Lunch
THe Pizza was better than I expected - crunchy yet chewy and not too thick crust and delicious
Salad is standard, but again, nice
There wasn't much decor and the food was line-counter style (think Sbarro's) but the pizza was DELISH! the crust was crunchy and there was a perfect balance of every ingredient
I will definately go back there!
I've tried them all, Aiellos has the best wings in NYC, possibly the world
Coupled with an assortment of other great food/prices, there is no going wrong
Without a doubt, Aiello's has the HOTTEST wings this Southern girl has ever tasted
I thought I could handle the suicidals with no problem since my tastebuds enjoy Tabasco, Crystal sauce, and most spicy New Orleans cuisine
I had but one wing and my mouth was on fire! Tears were running down my cheeks and my nose wouldn't stop running! But it was soooo worth it! Aiellos has other options (like a less spicy wing - yummy) and excellent pizza
Aiello's is not for the weak-stomached but well worth the pain!
Granted, there is no where else that I know of to get sauce this hot, but the quality of the chicken is atrocious
Dry and tough is not good chicken
Nothing there has ever even come close to impressing me
It is a good place to get food if you are in a hurry
Cheap but mediocre food
Ambiance and service  are below average
Not a good place for a special night at all
I think it is good take out if you do not want to spent much money
This place is truely amazing
Yes sometimes you wait for a table alittle longer or for your delivry order couple of minutes long but this place is truelly great
From its food, to the service to the OWNERS
How many restaurants can you say that about, where the owners are there and mingle with the customers
I have been a loyal customer since their early days, and this place is great
The food is amazing, the taste and the price
The decor is alittle cheesey but everything is great
No joke, this is the best baklava ever conceived by man! We've eaten there 6 or 7 times and have never had a bad meal
While the decor is average, the food is definitely a cut above
I strongly recommend the Yogurtlu Tavuk (Yogurt Chicken)
It is grilled chicken (really soft!) over pita with yogurt and tomato sauce over the top
Killer
You won't regret it
Also the coban salata (tomato salad) and pide (Turkish pizza) is excellent
Enjoy!
I came here twice
The service is quite good and the prices are reasonable
The dcor is very basic
I highly recommend the Mediterranean platter
It is better than some of the platters Ive had at upscale establishments
The kebabs are good and the mixed grill has plenty of food perhaps enough for two
The liver cubes are ok, though a bit over-fried
The tea and coffee are nice
The red Turkish wine is acceptable with meat, but cannot pass muster on its own

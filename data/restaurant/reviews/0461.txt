wd-50 may be tucked far away in the LES, but it's well worth the trip for their creative, artful cuisine in an intimate setting perfect for special occasions
the service was excellent and very helpful with our questions about the menu and the wines
the food was light, well-portioned, and created successful combinations of unexpected but intense flavors! they also offer interesting cocktails and specialty shots
all in all, my boyfriend had an amazing birthday dinner (complimentary cake and all :)
The food at WD-50 is innovative, well thought out and skillfully executed
You won't find boring comfort food or unimaginative dishes on the menu
This is a place for challenging your senses and experiencing new tastes and textures
And please, don't listen to any of the reviews here that claim the portion sizes are too small and the prices too high
You're not going to a chain restaurant in a mall
There is an actual chef in the kitchen preparing your food, and you're paying for his creativity and quality ingredients
You will not leave hungry, either
The clincher, for us, was the outstanding service from the waitstaff
They knew every ingredient in every dish and did not hesitate to answer any questions
I will definitely be returning to WD-50 again soon
i went with a foodie, a complete nonfoodie, myself being in the middle
the non-foodie summed it up with It's not fair that tomorow I will be eating average food again
The foie gras terrine was food alchemy, a surreal mix of ingredients that made perfect sense on the palette
My pork belly was southern food completely reimagined into something close to heaven, answering the question is fat a bad thing? absolutely not! As far as the portions, I left satisfied after three courses
Not bloated and gross, not stuffed, just completely satisfied
If you are not when you leave you need to reevaluate your eating habits
Our waitress was icing on the cake, witty, warm and passionate about the food at wd50
If she had prodded i would have ordered the entire menu, and loved it
Heard a lot about this place so was fired up to go, but was sadly disappointed
Interior is awkward and stark
Hostesses were sweet, but our waitress was anything but
The only time she cracked a smile was when she brought the bill
Menu had several fish selections (snapper, salmon, cod) but all were around $30 despite the fact that the portions would hardly fill a child's belly and the sides were 3 pieces of lettuce (literally)
Tables are also EXTREMELY close together which makes for awkward conversations
Much better ambience, selection and service elsewhere in the LES
Won't be going back to this place
We had high expectations, and concerns about the complexity of the menu before we went, but everything was really great
The three of us shares each course, and we all agreed that everything was delicious and just right
The service was perfect, and the only dissappointment was the wine list and the wine manager's advice
he has a lot to learn about his job, and pairings, and how to describe wines!
We Went there with high expectations and we were thoroughly pleased with everything
Superb service, relaxed atmosphere, and great food that featured some of the most creative (and odd) blend of flavors
It's a must try!
I took my Mother here for her birthday and we had a wonderful experience
The room and atmosphere is inviting
The waitstaff is super friendly and very cognizant
The menu and wine list are thought provoking and adventurous
The food blew us away
I have only heard great things (except for a few people on this site and they sound like miserable people in general)
Congratulations to the folks here for pushing the boundries of conventional dining
And for everyone else that doesn't get it
there is always the Olive Garden
For being a couple without connections in this place, we we're treated very hospitably to a great evening
The tasting menu experience lasted close to three hours and included six or seven food courses and three desert courses
As great as the first courses were, I think that this should really be considered a place where there are two equals in the kitchen as the sweeties may have even been more extraordinary than the salties
After being promtly seated by personable waitstaff(waiter Dave was without a doubt a highlight), WD-50 lived up to all my expectations and more
Those who have previously criticized the innovative food of Wylie Dufresne are clearly old fashioned, closeminded, and should stick the extra-large extra-greasy portions they are probably accomstomed to at Fridays
Wylie gives dining out an entirely new, rich dimension and I applaud his creativity
The Skate was delectable as an entree while the mango ravioli for dessert were like nothing I've ever tasted
it's been a while since I have seen portions so small at a downtown restaurant
sure, the food is tasty but leaving hungry is wee disappointing after forking out the likes of $14 for starter and $28 for entree
No sides to speak of nor a chance to order any
Great food but honestly not enough of it
Great service, seated promptly
Entire staff were very attentive and nice! Food was delicious and drinks great
never mind what grimes said about the decor, the food here, simply put, is important
it would have been so easy for wylie to do another 71 clinton and rest on his laurels, I applaud him for having the guts to raise the bar
whether or not you get his food, if you care about food and the direction food is going, you must try it
i thoroughly enjoyed everything i ate, white gaspacho of almonds, cucumber, grapes, manila clams and smoked paprika oil? incredible
cocktails, wine, desserts and service are all superb
The food is conceptually interesting yet curiously lacking in emotional impact
You don't walk out saying wow that food was fantastic! Rather, the reaction is more along the lines of what an interesting idea
I felt flattened by the experience as a result
Is it too much to ask for daring, cutting edge food that tastes terrific?
Only reason to go is Eben, the most solicitious bartender in NYC (now) with drink knowledge and ability to spare
The rest of the place might simply need new management
Go Eben, go!
Lot of hype for a perfectly fine place
Menu was interesting, execution was above average
Portions are tiny, prices are silly, service was mediocre, cocktails were excellent
Way too much hullaboo for a real middle of the road experience
I'd go again - if it were easy and not on my tab
But I'd definitely say go elsewhere - Craft, Gramercy, etc
- for that kind of money and pain to get a reservation
Really bold food ideas that require adventurous eaters to truly appreciate
We loved the food
But what's with the super high prices and the lousy location? And don't tell me that it's LES chic! That's just marketing BS
Okay, go there once to see what creative chefs can really do with food but then don't go back until they move to a better locale
I'm always intrigued to read bad reviews of a restaurant
They usually range from bad service to the portions were too small and the meal was too expensive
To the contrary, WD-50 does with food what many chefs are scared to do
break the mold and experiment
It's refreshing that in the chaotic ratings driven culinary environment of New York there are chefs willing to play with their food (and not just stack it and contort it with ring molds)
The wine list is excellent and offers many unique wines and while the portions may be on the small side, dare to splurge and try more
and who says that going out to dinner is about gorging yourself?! If you want heaps of food for $10 go to Fridays or something
I recently dined at WD-50 with a group of six
At the end of our expensive meal we were plotting where to go to satiate our hunger
All but one of us had an appetizer and entree- the portion sizes are small- not for sharing
The restaurant's decor was the only high point (cool bathroom and great booths) and there was some celeb gazing (Bobby Flay) The food was beautiful but simply not satisfying
I'm so happy Wylie finally got it together to open up, we were starving for some innovative food! The room is delightful and comfortable, the service knowledgeable and friendly
The food is, however, why you're there and it delivers! We managed to try most of the menu and there's not a disappointment in sight! I love the monkfish, the rabbit and what about that squid? Yumm
For once, the desserts measure up to the menu, bravo
the kumquat dish is a winner! The wines and cocktails complete the picture, delicious, fairly priced and well-chosen
Congratulations people, bloody well done
the food here was probably some of the best I have had in a long time, but the portions were extremely tiny
Had the duck appetizer which was ok, but really small for the price

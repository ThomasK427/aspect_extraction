There's no dance floor and it's a restaurant that tries to be a lounge
If you're looking for socializing then go somewhere else
The doormen here ask you upfront for cash if you wanna gain entry
Keep in mind that the restaurant itself doesn't charge a cover
If you don't throw these overrated goons money then they will make you stand outside until you just leave
Went here last nite for dinner with a couple of friends and not only was Katie Couric there sponsoring 8-minute dating, but the staff treated my friends and I like royalty
The atmosphere was nice, big and airy with a huge bar area
The food (we each had a fish entree) was good, and the waiters/manager made it worth the while
I'll definelty be returning and not just because of the free drink passes we scored at the end of dinner!
So the crowd doesnt have to travel far when they come into Midtown
Went on Friday night and to keep it simple, if you want to spend an evening with engaging people who don't stand around trying to look important; then this is not the place for you
The staff is ridiculously rude for no reason other that to add to the aura that you are somewhere very special, somewhere that you are privileged to be at
Really bad crowd
Give me a break; plain and simple don't go
A shame because the space is beautiful
Went Friday for opening night and it was a waste of my time
I was comped entrance but it was like pulling teeth to get upstairs to the VIP section
When I finally got upstairs it was a joke
No room to dance and everyone trying to look important
Ordered a bottle for $300, no big deal but I later found out that one of the managers told my friend that it was a 5 bottle minimum
Sure! Let me save you the drama, don't waste your time with this place
They think that it is a trendy hot spot but in reality it is a lame overpriced joke
You would think for a party of over 20 people, they would put us all at one table
they sat us at several round tables, away from one another
Then moved us to several long tables
Then proceeded to tell us that they couldn't take the order until every party member arrived
Rushed us through ordering, pressured us into ordering dessert/coffee, and then began picking up the tables to set up for the dance floor
the dancing started all around us while we were still eating
Not worth the prices
I really had no expectations about dining here - I mostly go downtown
But, Guastavino's was really special
Nice seating arrangement, very attentive wait staff (although slow) and the food (prix fixe) was very, very good
Good selection of meat and fish
Plus, you can't help but look around at the wonderful architecture
It's a Go
Went with my 2 children
the food was very good, the ambiance great and the waiters were excellent
Would definitly go BACK!
Went on a Fri night for drinks at the bar
Looked around and discovered almost everyone else was 35+
The bar area is not for anyone looking to meet and mingle, and may be disappointing for the twenties crowd
The bartenders were somewhat rude but made cosmos
Got out of there after 1 drink
But the high ceiling did add upclass air to this place
what a disappointment! the food was average and our waiter was horrible
It took forever to even take a drink order
When the spastic waiter finally stopped by our table, we told him we were going to order everything at once b/c we were getting pretty hungry
(having asked for bread at this point 3 times and still with out) He dashed off before we even finished the drink order! He apologized b/c they were understaffed and said a waiter was in the hospital - hey, not my problem!!! I imagine the manager has yet to be found because he was hiding all night!
We ate Thanksgiving dinner there on the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel
We were seated promptly (they even had a place to store my walking shoes)
The server and the chef went above and beyond to make a plain salad and a plain bowl of pasta for my son
Our food was wonderful from appetizer to dessert
The service was attentive but not obtrusive and the waitstaff friendly
Every one greeted us with a pleasant word
One price for dinner left for no surprises
I would recommend it to any one looking for a wonderful total experience
I had a terrible experience on what was supposed to be a night to celebrate the engagement of my friend of 20+ years
I was on a list for the upstairs which proved to be meaningless
I waited 30 minutes outside and then another 15 minutes on a second line inside to get upstairs
The gentleman who decided who would go up and when was as arrogant as they come
When I questioned the purpose of waiting on this line, I was asked to leave the bar
After 45 minutes, I was unable to enter the elitist upstairs and was unable to celebrate my friend's engagement
I will never EVER enter this place again and will tell everyone I know about this situation
Don't waste your time here
there are thousands of other bars in NYC that appreciate their patrons
I have never seen a blatant attempt by a restaurant to solicit letter writing?? Mix it up a bit!! All in all the food is lackluster, the service ok and the decor/space phenomenal
I always hoped the food would be better, it never performs
I'll give it one more shot then forget it
move on
Who else thinks that the recent reviews are questionable for this place? C'mon 10 reviews all on Nov 14, all 10's
Mix it up a bit if you are going to post fake reviews
Anyway, the place is not half bad, the decor rocks, and the food is alright
Not great food, but again, the space is pretty spectacular
The staff should be turned a couple of times or two, but overall it wasn't bad
A few weekends ago I planned my sister's birthday party at Guastavino's
I knew it was going to be a great place to do it because I have been there before and always enjoyed myself
Well I was NOT disappointed! We all had a great time and my sister was so happy that we celebrated at Guastavino's
I recommend it for a birthday party, it's so big that you can really get a whole crowd in there no problem
I am a regular fan of this place! Guastavino's is honestly one of the best places to go and be seen in NYC
There are always different and fun people to meet there
Guastavino's is not just a great restaurant but a fantastic place to go out on a weekend night as well
What a classy place
I walked in and couldn't believe my eyes
Amazing restaurant with great food and terrific service
Stayed into the night and it turned into a fun bar with great music and dancing, yet still held onto its class
Gorgeous space! One of the most impressive venues I have been to in Manhattan and I have seen a lot! Fun crowd on the weekend nights too-I danced a little, drank a little and had a great overall time
Great place for a big group of friends to go and large enough venue that you don't get clausterphobic
Serves great food as well
Went to Guastavino's a few Saturdays ago for my friend's birthday party and we couldn't have picked a better place than Guastavino's to celebrate
The atmosphere is incredible and the place attracts such a fun crowd
I have no complaints about my night there, I would recommend it to anyone
One cannot find (or build for that matter) a more impressive and beautiful space in Manhattan
Daniel Orr's cuisine is a perfect match for this setting
His bistro sesibilities are well rooted in the downstairs Brasserie
Upstairs in the Club his expertise and passions for his craft shine
I have lived in NY for over 2 years now, and this is by far the most fun I've ever had at a bar/restaurant
The people were extremely friendly, no loud music to drown out conversations
The decor was great, bar staff extremely friendly and prompt
I am definetly going to go there at least 2-3 times per month
I didn't get to eat there, but one of my friends ate at the bar, and it looked damn good

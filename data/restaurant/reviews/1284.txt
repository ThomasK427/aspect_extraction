probably the weakest was the potato salad
I agree with others that the brisket trailed the field, but my chicken was ok
Honestly, the pork blew them all away
And I'm sorry, we New Yorkers may not like it but white bread
very southern
like BBQ
After seeing this place in Time Out NY's best barbeque issue, I gave it a try
The food was great especially the pulled pork with Carolina vinegar sauce and the cole slaw
My wife had a 3 meat combo and there was so much meat she took the rest home
For dessert we enjoyed the key lime pie and old fashioned chocolate layer cake
They also have about 25 bourbons from the lowliest to the highest high end stuff
The staff is young and friendly, the room is nice, and the service good
People seem to either love this place or hate it
I love it
It's a nice little neighborhood bar that serves a delicious pulled pork sandwich and baby back ribs
More of a bar with a kitchen than a restaurant
I've been there more than a few times and haven't ever been disappointed
You can't go wrong with any of the 30 bourbons or maybe a Lone Star or Abita either
no atmosphere, $14 entrees on paper baskets (no kitsch involved just lacking), mac and cheese had no cheese, service friendly but didn't question less than half eaten food
Cafeteria food that lacked the charm and flavor of a cafeteria
Save your money
I went to bar bq after seeing it on the top of CitySearch's Best BBQ list
I was very disappointed
Honestly it wasn't good at all
I tried a rib and brisket combo w/ 2 sides for 14 bucks
I got some white bread w/ my combo which I thought was lame
The ribs were average
Plus, the ribs were small
The brisket was not that good either
I really can't believe how small the portions were when I think back on it
It's not cheaper than the city and you get a lot less for your money
One good thing about this place are the sides, they were quite tasty
So if you're looking to waste your money, feel free
If anyone has eaten at Bar BQ, please write a review, good or bad
Great brisket, pulled pork and even hot links
Excellent beer selection, great prices
Can't wait to go back!!!
Love this place
Ive been there a couple of times
I tried a couple of sampler combos which I really enjoyed
Hot sauce selection is growing which I like and the staff is friendly
I'm thrilled to see this little BBQ place open up in my neighborhood
I've been a couple of times and I've loved the food
The pulled pork is to die for and the chicken is tasty too
The sides are totally yum as well
Service was super friendly and it's a great place to relax, have a beer and some good barbecue
A great addition and I'll be visiting on a regular basis
Oh, one thing - Please get more of that amazing apple-wheat beer you had on tap recently
That was terrific
They should take out the BQ from their shamelessly named BAR BQ
This place is simply another neighborhood bar; there is certainly NO BQ when I ate there
PERIOD
The Ribs tasted like they were stewed or broiled first, and then grilled for 2 mins before being served to me
The Briskets were dry and, like the ribs, were completely without the smokey flavor of BBQ
But to be fair, the sides totally made up for the disappointment of the main course
And yah, my combo meal also unapologetically came with 2 flimsy slices of white bread
YES, straight out of the WONDER BREAD bag
I've never been to a BBQ eatery where white bread was served! I've generally have nothing against white bread; they are the best for PBJ (peanut butter and jelly) sandwiches
Now thinking back, I was offended as a diner to be served at this place
Great, simple barbeque food
The brisket is insanely good and the homemade sauces, both sweet and vinegar are offered, are addictive
Nice open space with a beautiful, vintage horsheshoe bar
Cute pigs and folksie decor, nice staff and plenty of parking
They also have a big selection of bottled hot sauces and for the fans of bourbon, there must be more than twenty fancy bottles from which to choose!
This might be the newest best kept secret in Brooklyn
While I love other BBQ places in Manhattan, I found this local establishment great
Not only is the atmosphere less hurried and more relaxing, it was affordable and the food was GREAT
This is an excellent place to take a family or celebrate a birthday
Staff was really friendly
I highly recommend this to anyone who loves BBQ or has wanted to try it for the first time
It's a fantastic thing to have an authentic, affordable and affable place to go for solid food and real drinks in the burgeoning Park Slope landscape of eateries and bars
Bar BQ will knock your socks off with every entree (pulled pork and the ribs -- go full rack, kid, it won't do you wrong) and the homey taste of the sides (love that slaw, them beans, and all that tater salad) matches up perfectly
Drinks are reasonable, and the selection of good beers for the menu is genius
Chef Turnitza, I'm yours! Also, the comfy seats and the big ol' bar (with a rockin' juke too) makes for a great atmosphere, friendly to eaters, daters and families -- it's a place where smart, good looking people in the know are spending there hard-earned leisure time, baby
So go already!
While visiting NY I happended upon this place
Very friendly and the food was GREAT
my only comment was I would like to see silverware
but it added to the feeling like you were in the south
the bar and atmosphere were great
I will diffently visit this place again when I get back in town
I had pulled pork, bar-bq chichen and ribs, baked beans, mac and cheese and everything was excellent
Especially the ribs
The pulled pork was melt in your mouth tender and the chicken moist and tangy with the outstanding bar-bq sauce I kept pouring over it
And they serve white bread with it all! The beer was cold, the service warm and friendly and yes, I was licking my fingers
Oh, the music was great too
English Beat into some 70's soul
I never had REAL Swedish food before
This place is tucked away in midtown
When I went for Sunday dinner it was quiet and the neighborhood was charming
They had outdoor seating and good waitstaff
I recommend the Swedish meatballs
It came with mashed potatoes and lignonberry sauce
Delicious
The portions were enormous and I didn't have room for dessert
They have a great little bar and have drink specials from 5-7 daily
I'm definitely going to go there again
I live near by and love coming to this place for brunch
The servers are friendly and go out of their way to make sure you're happy
The food is very flavorful, and I find myself always raving about it to my friends

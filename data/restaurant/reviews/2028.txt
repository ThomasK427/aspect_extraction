The best cupcakes in the worls! Please, who are they kidding
Maybe once upon a time
I was in there once before because I had heard that they serve sweets from old fashioned southern Recipes
May I tell you that coming from a South Carolina native their products are not at all the moist and sweet delicacies of the treats down under
I thought that i would return and give them a second chance only to realize that the cupcakes still weren't all that and that the staff was only ruder
Instead, they are dry, stale little cakes overly frosted with mulicolored not multiflavores icings that taste like sugar
The rude, overpopulated staff and cramped in environment did not make my experience any more enjoyable
I do not understand why people run here to choke off their dry, overrated cupcakes
Please, run the other way
yes, theres a cap-off on cupcakes, but for good reason! magnolia is a fantastic late-nite stop to make or experience to have when visiting (or living in) nyc
the buttercreme icing is out of this world and in generous portions
and you gotta love a staff with tattoos AND manners! mixing the old-fashioned with the new, a lovely stop
I called 2 days in advance to order cupcakes for a birthday party and was told, 'sorry we have a very high demand for cupcakes, we need a week's notice for an order' Are you kidding me?! But it gets better, the woman who works there told me I could come in and buy 12 at one time c/ that's not considered an order, but that's the max she can sell to one person
Obviously she is NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING $$$$ b/c then she told me I could get someone off street to come in and order another 12 if I really wanted 24
Um, no thanks I'll take my business elsewhere!!!!
Magnolia Bakery is completely overrated
The service is always slow and staff don't take their job seriously
The cakes are dangerously sweet and nothing else
If this is supposed to be as good as homemade cakes, it really gives homemade cooking a bad name
Surely, there are those who don't care about the quality but just want to see and to be seen there
How sad
The cupcakes at magnolia's are world famous as of the article in The new york times but although these cupcakes are excellent i would like to say that the people in magnolia's were very rude and another thing was that they were overpriced and this dessert place has very good food!!!
they have the best cupcakes i have ever had
this place is so, so, good and the cupcakes are not dry at all
i highly suggest coming here for a cupcake, some banana pudding or whatever it is that you're craving
they're also open pretty late which is great!
The cupcakes are totally overrated, I was highly disappointed
The icing is sweet, smooth and buttery but the cupcake was very dry and not sweet at all, very bland and flavorless
Without the frosting, it tasted like a childs really bad attempt to bake a cake, even with the icing it was not worth eating
I would have been better off baking my own from Pillsbury
Still in search of a great cupcake so if you know of any, just let me know
The goods are yummy, although I don't think they are worth enduring the horrible service
I've been there at least 5 times with different groups of people because they heard about this bakery and wanted to try it out
EACH timeI've been there, all my friends agreed that the staff were rude
One time a staff member knocked something over at the register and had the audacity to blame my friend and make a snide comment towards her in front of customers while she was paying
Well, i was really looking forward to this cupcake after everything i had heard
So here is what i though: the icing was damn good but the cake itself was not
It was dry and not very sweet, tasted like flour
I tried the yellow cake with the chocolate icing and with the pink icing and tasted a bite of my friends chocolate cupcake
SO, when you eat the cupcake you need to somehow get icing in every bite and make sure you have a big glass of milk with you
The red velvet cake: dry, unimpressive, maybe it sat around too long
Cupcakes: Ok, decent, but not any better or different than the ones your office mates tend to bring in
The worst is the service
that you can avoid at all costs
There's no southern charm here
I use to go there, cause I live down the street, and it was covenient for my sugar cravings
but now I'd rather go the deli and buy a snickers
When I tell you Magnolia Bakery serves the best cupcake I have ever had I am not exaggerating
There food is delicious
Whenever I walk by this dive and see all the sad clueless wannabees and tourists waiting endlessly to buy these choke inducing blocks they have the nerve to call cupcakes, I just laugh and keep on walking the few extra blocks to Out of the Kitchen
Their cupcakes are always fresh and trully flavorfull and their carrot cake is awesome
Next time you're in the neighborhood just walk on by Magnolia and go to Out of the Kitchen and hope they don't get an HBO cameo or they'll go down hill too
Magnolia cupcakes are pretty great, but sometimes it's just not worth the hassle and rudeness of the staff
The rude condescension just cancels out the joy of the cupcake experience
I prefer Out of the Kitchen on Hudson
The cupcakes are just as good and the staff is always friendly
I first tried these cupcakes at a bridal shower and loved them
The bakery is very old-fashioned, the self-serve is fun, and the cupcakes are delicious
It's true that most New York cupcakes that everybody fawns over are not good at all and the same is true here
The cake is always dense and not moist, and the icing is made of pure butter and tastes like it
Don't know why everyone likes Magnolia and the Cupcake Cafe and such for their cupcakes! What's good here is the banana pudding! Made like home with nilla wafers
YUM!
whoa! try the german chocolate cake
then get a cupcake for the next day
it's so delicious, kinda like mom used to make
so so good
on a summer night, sit on the outside bench to eat with a glass of milk
Icing: good
Staff: horrid
I always say I'm never going back, but then someone from outside the nabe says they love them so I pick up cupcakes for presents
The staff are hired for looks and what they wear
Too expensive, but that's the nabe
A little secret about New York's most beloved cupcakes; they're not that good
Really
No matter how many of the admittedly gorgeous, not-so-little things I've had foisted on me by well-intentioned friends, I remain unconvinced
No, they're *not* like mom's homemade at all
I never felt the need to scrape my tongue of residual butter or milk-flood my mouth to inhibit choking (on too-dry, too-dense cake) with mom's
If you like over-the-top, heavy-handed sweets, these are for you
If you want a cupcake that *looks* good, is neighbors with Marc Jacobs and has an HBO cameo on its' resum, Magnolias spot on
But if you're looking for something that actually tastes good, pass on the hipster cach and take your $1
50 elsewhere
(Perhaps down the block to Gristede's and a box of Betty Crocker ; )
seriously the best! and although the workers weren't fawning over me, they were still pleasant
but be prepared, this place is always packed! i have no idea why all these people are complaining
but hell if you've had better cupcakes just tell me where cuz i'll go there too!
I don't care what any doubters say, this place is my favorite
The best cupcakes, the best ice cream, not to mention banana pudding and other treats
My only regret is that they stopped making muffins which were fabulous
The place draws some serious crowds especially on weekend nights -- but definitely worth the experience
Who knew cupcakes could be so popular?
OK, so it might be crowded on the weekends, but make SURE you get some cupcakes or at least a cake
These delicious items will make you mouth water and make you coming back for more
If you can make it here and want something sweet, I HIGHLY recommend stopping by
I have NEVER in all my years of living in NYC encountered a ruder staff in any service industry establishment
EVERY time I call the bakery to place an order I am treated incredibly rudely- a minute ago the guy actually hung up on me
NEWSFLASH dude- you answer the phone in a bakery-check the rock star attitude- you ain't all that
What the heck? Do these people think they're the only game in town? Really people, better get nice, you're bringing the neighborhood down
If this place is so renowned, why not move to a bigger location? Instead of the cramped space where the line is crammed inside and the cupcakes are self-serve? Speaking of the supposed cupcakes, they are not that great
The only good thing is the frosting; the cupcakes crumble and fall apart the minute you take off the wrapper
The only reason I would return would be to sample the other desserts and if I have a large milk with me

Simply the best
From the coats and ties to jeans they all fit in here
Service impeccable
No reservations,then eat at the bar
The food extraordinary
with so many choices it is hard to believe this restaurant still gets rave reviews
Only thing best about Union Square is the negative attitude of the wait staff
Food far from wonderful
For people that call Union Square Carfe boring or dull I suspect that they are more interested in a trendy scene than an incredible dining experience
Union Square Cafe is the PARADIGM of good service
I'm so comfortable and at home there
The food is delicious (it never claimed to be Jean Georges) and an incredible value for the money
And the wine list is OUT OF THIS WORLD--small, but comprehensive and extremely reasonably priced
I once saw a bottle of wine priced at $230 on USC's menu that was over $700 on Danielle's menu
The staff is amazing and clearly genuinely care that you have a good experience
Dining out should be an all-encompasing experience that includes food, wine, service, and a warm, happy glow when you leave
USC accomplishes all that and more
Good place to meet friends
Not the greatest food bu heck it is in Union Square
Loud spot but good people watching
This place is fine and certainly doesn't deserves the praise of one of the best restaurants around
The menu is dull-American and there plenty of better places to go if you want a $60 dinner
We have dined at great reataurants around the world, many in NYC
This is amongst the best
The service and staff are just a delight
When questioning our server about a certain dish, she kindly brought over the Union Sq
Cafe recipe book so that I could copy the ingredients! The food is eclectic and well executed
After so many years, it still is a treat to dine there
I was disappointed in this restaurant
The service was pretty bad (waiter forgot drinks, kept us waiting forever between courses and for the bill), and the atmosphere was nothing special
It would be a good place to bring your parents but is not great for a date
The food was, however, very good
I had a fantastic tomato salad and some delicious tuna
I love the fact that a lot of the shopping is done at the greenmarket across the street
Nice enough restaurant, but I can't see why it's Zagat's Most Popular Restaurant in NYC
This place has a great atmosphere, and if you request a table, it can be great for large groups
They sat about 12 of us at a huge round table in a separate room and we had a blast
The bar is filled with hot, well dressed guys
but the waitresses looked like they were all dressed to go clubbing and didnt provide very good service
It would be hard for any restaurant as heralded as Union Square Cafe to live up to its monumental reputation
Gladly, though, USC delivers in spades
We were seated immediately, and began a wonderful dining experience that was never hurried by brusque staff
On the contrary, USC's sterling rep is earned as much by the incredible wait-staff as by the delicious food
Expensive, yes, but worth every penny
You will nver walk away disappointed only wanting to go back
A must dining experience
From the Door to dessert you will fall in love with the Union Square
A must have is the creamy Pollenta
Great Bar for lunch if you can get a chair
This was my first visit to the most popular restaurant in NYC and I was so impressed
The service was great, our waiter brought us an appetizer on the house because he felt we just had to try it, and he overheard us say it was my fiances birthday and brought us a dessert with a candle and decorated plate
The food was delicious
I highly recommend the tomato and got cheese salad and the lamb chops
Deserves every high rating!
one of the best meals i have had in a long time
The service was fantastic and the whole evening was fantastic
Cannot wait to go back!!
I recently ate here for the second time in two months
It is so refreshing to eat at a restaurant that does not need to be trendy or self-important to attract diners, but instead can rely on the quality of its menu and its unbeatable service
This is what dining is all about!
After all the reviews and the recent review from Grimes, I expected to have the meal of my life
What I got instead was decent food, served by a very well trained, but impersonal staff
My table order four desserts, the fig tart was really disapointing, two were average at best and one was worth the calories
Perhaps my disappointment was an expectation that I was going to one of the best restaurants in the City, what I got was an over-rated, over-priced average meal
Incredible dishes, beautiful atmosphere and casual enough to really enjoy!!
It's become the yearly spot for birthday dinners! The food is great, the menu is FULL of great choices, there's something for everyone
You won't be dissapointed!
Best overall experience in a Manhattan restaurant
Food was in the category of to die for
Service was very friendly, professional and prompt
Recommendations were right on the mark
It was solid all the way around
The total experience was more than the sum of its parts
I came to USC expecting a phenomenal experience
What I found was rude and blase service (it took forty minutes to even order a drink at 10:00 at night), so-so food, and an overall mediocre dinner
I'm from Seattle and work in the restaurant industry, and assumed that for being so highly rated on Zagat's (and owned by Danny Meyer) this place should have been outstanding
Not so
I ate at several other places while I was in town, and have to say that this was by far the most dissapointing
I'll take the restaurants in the Emerald City over this place any time
I took my fiance to USC for his birthday, and it was spectacular! We each had an appetizer, entree, and dessert, and every item was sensational! I am not one to spend $100 on a meal, but it was worth every penny, and I hope to eat there again soon
Be sure to try the black bean soup, Fried Chicken (Friday special), and Tuna Filet Mignon
Also, the service was well above par- they were extremely knowledgable, friendly, and efficient
After hearing the raves about Union Square Cafe, I decided to make a reservation there for a special night out with my boyfriend who was visiting from out-of-town
Maybe it was an off night, but we were less than impressed with this restaurant
We waited over 30 minutes to get our drinks (which were brought over my the manager) and we could not find anyhting that looked interesting on the menu
Next time I want to blow over $150 I won't be heading to this over-priced and not to mention pretentious place
The best dining experience in NY! I had the scallops and turnips and they were delicious
Each dish was better than the last
Loved it
Friend took me to USC after seeing a play
The service was impeccable and friendly
Food was unexciting although the calamari appetizer and chocolate-hazelnut cake with chocolate sorbet were a real treat! Cozy, private and relaxed, they make you feel right at home
Our experience at USC was by FAR the best dining experience we have had in new york city
The matre'd sat us underneath a flowering tree, in a corner booth so we could spend the evening watching everyone and being romantic the entire night
Just perfect the whole night
The service was exceptional
We were NEVER pressured
They brought over special touches like a pre-appetizer course and the spacing between courses was perfect
No, like the review says, it was not the most innovative cuisine I have ever tasted
However, the quality of ingredients and decidedly mature knowledge in preperation, seasonings, the matching of sides far outweights this criticism of USC

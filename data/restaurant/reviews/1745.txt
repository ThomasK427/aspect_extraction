I had a rich and delicious chocolate mini-cake and my husband had a creme filled pastry
Both were fantastic
but the best part was the very friendly man behind the counter offering suggestions and being very patient with us as we decided
I will return here again and again
In Short Owner Amy Scherber opened her first bakery on 9th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen in 1992
Next came this shop in the Chelsea Market, where most of the bread is baked for all the stores
Most renowned for breads incorporating olives, herbs, nuts, even prosciutto, the bakery also features cakes like Red Velvet and coconut cream
Sandwiches and salads are available for takeout lunches, and a brief brunch menu is also available at this location
to the delicious sandwiches and I think, for me, the best cupcakes in the neighborhood! [Seriously
try the vanilla cake with the chocolate icing!] The bread has nearly always dissapointed though
the flavor is somehow off for me and I've tried many varieties And you do have to watch the staff
I've had the wrong items put in my bag more than once!
i recently moved to the chelsea area and visit chelsea market everyday
i usually go to Amy's Bread, but not anymore
that's the slowest moving staff i've ever seen in there
i don't know what happened in the past month but the service sucks now
everyone in there seems to be taking care of thier own personal needs
i went in there to get a coffee but i guess the chinese girl is keeping it all to her self
i'll just go to Sarabeth's cause they have better coffee and service anyway
Bought some bread recently at the Chelsea Market Amy's -- the selection was limited and the staff slow, inefficient and surly
Got home to discover that two of the three mini-loaves they'd given me weren't the right flavor
The bread was passable but all in all, it's not an experience I have any interest in repeating
Numerous tiny desserts to choice from
Not a single miss to date
Highly underrated
My friend told me about my place and I just liked so much french style cakes! Especially I found the eclaires were exellent
3 dollars for 1 eclaire sounds quite expensive in Paris, but its tast just reminds me of my Paris!  I haven't bought french baguette yet, as it looked a bit diffirently, but I will try one day some croissants
This place is not always overcrowded, which is good for me, and there are places you can eat and take a good, real expresso!
one of the best French pastry shops in NYC
my personal fave for cappacino
Almond croissants mmmmmmm good
I go here 3 times a week on average
Also try Success and Napoleon
Good sandwiches and quiche too
This restaurant has been --around for years----I remember that you couldn't just walk in----now it seems you can
Why-------because it seems the odor of the bathrooms permeates throughout the restaurant above---------A lot of bleach in the basement bathrooms would go a long way to freshening up this place
BUT THE FOOD IS STILL GREAT
I wish every place was like Bruxelles
You can't beat the location and atmosphere
I have been going to Cafe de Bruxelles since 1994 by stumbling upon it
I find the food and atmospher to be wonderful
The prices have not gone up terribly in 10 years and even though it is a la carte the portions are of a good size
I will agree that the service is not always up to par
When it's busy you can occassionally sit for awhile to get more water
This has improved over the years
I have taken people from NY, TX and MO to this restaurant and they loved it
If you like Mussels a definite must visit!!
They have a fantastic Creme Brulee Tart not something that you can find elsewhere!
the mussels were excellent
the frites? okay
the waitress? ugh ugh UGH
she was just plain MEAN
she literally walked up to our table, stood there with an index card in her hand, looked at us blankly, and said NOTHING
my friend finally said um
hello? then the waitress sigh heavily, and mumbled would you like to hear the specials or what? we said yes, and then she read off the specials in monotone
um, ok
we'd done nothing to deserve this--we simply sat down and wanted to order
that being said, the bus boys were fine, the mussels were great, the beer, as others have noted, was too expensive
i won't be going back, and i'll tell all my friends not to go--you guys could have the best mussels in the whole world, but that waitress must be keeping a lot of customers away
Years ago, Bruxelles used to be my favorite neighborhood restaurant and had the all time best hamburger
Not anymore
This place is stale and the food only so-so
It needs to be improved/updated/enhanced and the beer list, which is largely Belgian, is way over-priced
What a cute little place! My boyfriend and I tend to just walk past it whenever we're in the Village, but last week, we just walked on in!   I have to comment, the waiters were simply delightful (and good looking! Sorry boyfriend
!) We ordered sweetbreads to share which I was assured, we're delish
and they were
The after dinner coffee was also the perfect compliment to the meal (I am not sure what they put in it, but it tasted incredibly smooth) and the check was totally reasonable
A great find and highly recommended
Thanks Bruxelles
My wife and I LOVE this place
We go as often as we can and the food is ALWAYS incredible
The sweetbreads are always perfectly cooked, the venison is tender, and the pommes deicious and cripsy! Definately one of our favorite restaurants
Delicious moules la escargot (mussels in garlic butter), charbonnade, and pommes frites
My friend had venison which he said was delicious, and came with a sort of crme de marrons--unusual but addicting
It's not particularly cheap, but you get what you pay for--charbonnade was $17 and it was an enormous plateful I couldn't finish (though I would have served some potatoes or noodles to soak up the sauce)
Good selection of Belgian beers, but they don't come cheap--lambics were $9
75 (Stella was $5 which isn't out of the ordinary)
The staff were very friendly and welcoming, but service started out great and slipped as it got later and the restaurant became jam-packed
I recommend coming early if you want a relaxed meal
By far the best pommes frites in town, with a wonderful tangy mayo
But the service was horrible
I'll give it another try and hope that I don't get the same stoned waitress
The Scene It's a good sign that many of Maroons' patrons actually hail from the South or Caribbean: They know the real thing when they taste it
Vintage photographs adorn the exposed brick walls of this eatery's perpetually packed two tiny rooms, and patrons can watch the cooks concoct their dishes in the visible, miniscule kitchen
The Food The menu is divided into Southern and Jamaican specialties, but the latter is the way to go
While soul-food favorites like macaroni and cheese, meatloaf and collard greens are perfectly tasty, the beef patties are piquant and tender; the fried plantains are sweet and syrupy; the crab cakes are fresh and peppery; and the candied yams are topped off with brown sugar
Remember to leave room for dessert: The hostess scolds you if you refuse to try the sweet potato pie
Went to this restaurant based on the favorable reviews from this site
Arrived right before the evening diners
No wait time
Sat at the bar, by choice, leisurely moved to the dinning room after a couple of drinks
Excellent happy hour, excellent hostess, wonderful waiter, fast service, and delicious food
The old photos on the wall add a nice touch to the decor
homey feel
Mixed crowd
Will definately add this restaurant to our list
Looking forward to going w/ a group of friends
The food here was so amazing
They serve delicious cornbread instead of bread before the meal
And although the desserts may be pricy at around $8, they are worth it

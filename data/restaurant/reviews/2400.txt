Not to mention delicious Tapas! Tapas! Tapas! You just can't go wrong here
I have eaten at many Manhatten restaurants, this by far is the worst
The food was tasteless
It seemed like the food was cooked several days earlier and was re-heated several times since
Earlier positive reviews must have been written by the owner
Eventually this restaurant will be out of business
If you want good tapas do not go here!
Had dinner their on Saturday night
not crowded ambience was good
food was pretty good
nothing crazy
its a solid place
There was an incident with something in my food where they need to replace the dish
what it was i wont say fear Factor because it can happen in most average places and you sometimes can fault the restaurant for it
However they did not take it off my bill or sincerely apologize for it
take it for what you want
Average
I spent the week in NYC this past spring at the Big East Championship and returned to Picasso's for the best dining experience in town
This place has the best service, great food, and can be as romantic or as fun as you choose
A truly private place for me and my family
Highly recommended!
Amazing restaurant with authentic Spanish food and some of the best service in NYC
Ask for Ishmael, he's gracious and attentive
A perfect evening is to sit at the bar, stuff yourself silly on gambas, manchego cheese, jamon serrano and wash it all down with some wonderful sangria
I used to be a regular when I lived in NY now I return every trip and send friends there
A must
It's all about the food and service at this quiet neighborhood gem
No scene
Just great Spanish food at unbeatable prices
The waitstaff and management can't do enough for you
From complimentary starters to a seemingly automatic drink refill, and aperitifs on the house, to the sit, relax, stay awhile treatment, it feels more like your dining at a friend's place
The tapas are delectable - don't miss the shrimp in garlic sauce or the spanish sausage in red wine
Careful, the Sangria catches up with you!
The food is excellent and the prices very reasonable
The ambience is quiet and laid back
The steak is huge (fairly decent quality) for 24
99 and the paella is delicious
Worth the trip!!!
My boyfriend found this restaurant online and we decided to try it out on our 3 year anniversary
The reviews were correct - the service from the waitstaff will make u think that u are at a 5-star restaurant
The food scores 9 out of 10; I had the seafood paella and my boyfriend had the porkchop special
We were both very pleased, but when the dessert cart rolled around, little did I know I would be having the best Napolean in the world
I would definately go back just for dessert
The service was excellent
I am a waitress and couldn't wait to be waited on
The best part was that I felt like i was waited on hand and foot and they worked so well together
Thanks Picasso and our waiter guillermo
Far from trendy or chic, this restaurant focuses on excellent service and delicious tapas
The staff is warm and friendly, and miraculously remembers you each time you visit
They wait on you hand and foot with fabulous, authentic tapas and superb riojas
all at a very reasonable price
We had tapas and while most items were pretty good, it does not deserve the hype we read here
In fact, we figure it HAD to be fixed! The atmosphere in this place was so dark, dismal and 70's fine dining-ish
There were creepy weird posters on the wall and not a Picasso in sight
I mean really, how about a Picasso?! This place needs a serious makeover
I can see why everyone gives this place a 10
The food is delicious, the ambience warm, the prices incredibly reasonable, however it is the service that really makes the place stand out
We had 3 waiters attending to us and they were all really paying attention to our needs
We never once had to ask for more water or bread - they just appeared! It is definitely not a place to go if you're looking for a hip scene as most diners were age 60+, however if you want tasty food and excellent service at a good price, this is the place for you
(You can even get a bottle of decent Spanish wine for $20!) Can't wait to go back and try the mariscada
NYC is becoming the home of the $7
00 sandwich - and PAX is a prime example of this
While most of the food was good - but not great - the prices were disproportionally high
The food is tasty
I had the Spicy Bar-bque Pork and it is very Delicious
Sung had the Soup with some spicy shredded beef and he gave it a 8 out of 10
Yubin had the same as I and he also enjoyed his meal
Overall the food is very good but the other reviews are right you need to go to K-Town to get better pricing
But if you work around the hood then this is a good quick fix if you are in the mood for Korean Food
I usually go to K town and for Korean food and I eat it often enough to know good Korean food from bad
I tried KoreaPalace because it is close to work but the food was just horrible
Their tofu stew was so salty and thick, I only ate a quarter of it and there was like 3 little cubes of tofu
Their bibimbab had mostly lettuce and hardly any meat and for 14 bucks I don't feel I got my money's worth
Their little side dishes were skimpy too
I got the hot spicy soup (YookHweJang) and it tasted great
Almost as good as mom's
My colleague got the Bulgoki Box, which had a lot of neat items to eat, next to the beef
Personally, I think the beef always tastes better off the grill, but if you don't want your clothes to stink, the Box is the way to go
The side dishes (panchan) were pretty good and I think this place is priced pretty reasonably for midtown
This was my second time there, so I have no complaints
The food is good, the atmosphere is soothing (piano bar and soft lighting at nite), and it's in midtown! Huzzah! Recommend the yookgehjang (spicy red soup), the bulgogi (bbq boneless beef), and the bibimbap (rice and veggies)
This is one of my favorite spots for lunch in the area
Nothing beats the Clay Pot Bibimbop -- fried rice served sizzling in a hot clay pot that caramelizes as you eat it
Hard to believe the negative reviews
The one minor complaint would be the generic dining room, but the staff is always friendly and the food is terrific
I wish I could say less is more
I love korean barbecue meats -- especially kalbi
But, over the years I have noticed that the portions gets smaller and smaller while the prices have increased a fair amount
The barbecue meats that we ordered at Korea Palace and side dishes were ok
We did not get any soup though, and you had to ask for the rice
The service was average, and it was a average experience
Service was horrendous the night we went for dinner
Large group that ate over $450 received very little service
Meat dishes are overpriced (go to K-town) and waiters have tendency to take away your dish before you are done (probably so that you order more)
Didn't bring out the little free side dishes until a Korean person came late and asked for it (this is RIDICULOUS at a Korean restaurant)
Almost felt embarrassed to take my business clients there
Not worth the bad service at extra high costs
Go to Korea town (32nd St btwn 5th and B'dway); much better food, service, and prices!!!!!!!
The ambience is nothing special but the sushi at this place is some of the best around

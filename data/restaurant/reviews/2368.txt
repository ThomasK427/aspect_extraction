The price was around $20 per person and included dessert, which was also scrumptious - and a fabulous deal! The atmosphere and staff are both charming
Try Zarela's if you want a unique and different experience at a very reasonable price
I went here a couple weekends ago with two friends
I'm a vegetarian and not very familiar with Mexican food, so went out of my way to ask the waiter that what I was ordering was vegetarian
The server, however, did NOT understand English and sent a dish with chicken
The restaurant was dark and the chicken combined with other ingredients so I did not realize his mistaken until after a couple of bites
I have been a vegetarian for 14 years so obviously this was deeply disturbing
Our table was clearly very upset and he was completely incompetent and unsympathetic to our situation
I do NOT recommend this place at all
I don't understand how a server can make such an important and fundamental mistake, especially when a patron goes out of her way to confirm that she is getting a vegetarian dish
Worst customer service Ever!!
I'm a huge fan of mexican food, and any other latin cuisine due to the fact that I'm hispanic myself and come from a huge family that loves to cook
My boyfriend and I have been on a quest to find a truly authentic Mexiacn restaurant in the city
No luck yet
My two favorite spots are in Forest Hills and Sunnyside Queens
I've read about Zarela and was looking forward to going
Margaritas, service, and chips and salsa were the only good things
Highly dispointing menu selction ,small portions , and you had to pay additonal for your sides which btw, were nothing exciting and far from mexican
We walked out of there so disappointed and will never go back
Better places in the city to choose from
Zalera and Vong are probably my top favorite restaurants in NY
I have been repeatedly going to Zarela for the past 5 years simply because everyone I have taken loves this place, including Sushi snobs from Tokyo and a French friend who owns a bistro in Paris
The menu at Zarela pleasantly surprises the average New Yorker's conception of Mexican cuisine
I usually seek recommendations from waiters who are very friendly and professional
Moderate pricing and killer margarita makes this place perfect especially for parties :-)
I am an avid restaurant goer and Zarela has been one of my favorites for years
After a years absense I went back last week with a group of friends to find that nothing much had changed there
The cochinita pibil (pork) and arroz con crema were amazing
I tried a little of everyone's dish and found that everything was delightful, especially the inventive specials
We had an assortment of desserts which were orgasmic
The servers were excellent
They were quick, attentive and accomadating even though the place was full
They were friendly and even charismatic
We were treated very well
Zarela herself strides through the dining room stopping at every table to converse with customers
Nowhere else in NYC can you find such a welcoming, unpretensious restaurant with such wonderful, authentic food
And don't forget to have one of their famous margharitas!
I love this place! Mexico, I have recently learned, has one of the most complicated and surprisingly varied cuisines in the world
Zarela is certainly a great place to sample extraordinary and surprising dishes like red snapper hash spiced with clove, an amazing pork shoulder dish and (a sometimes special) chile rellenos filled with beef picadillo topped with a nutty cream sauce and fresh pomegranate seeds--my favorite
For those more conventional fans, Zarela has juicy steak fajitas and the best enchiladas with Oaxacan mole ever! Unlike some of its pricier competitors, Zarela offers large portions and encourages family-style sharing
I recently recommended that we go there for our office holiday party and it was a big hit
An added plus are their margaritas--hands down the best in the city
My favorite is the frozen passion fruit-made with fresh lime juice!
A friend recommended Zarela's for a get together
Like any smart New Yorkers those of us who had not yet been hit City Search
There were some worries
The reviews are, after all, decidedly hit or miss
Our evening went well
While there was the occasional, For the love of God, where is our waiter? we didn't complain because he was playful and friendly
I have to agree that the margarita's do cause quite a hangover
It's worth it, though
I was thrilled to find they even had mango flavored, a particular favorite of mine
We weren't given a hard time about the minimum so I suspect that this rule is only seriously enforced on certain nights of the week
It's in my top 5 favorite restaurants, and I am know my Mexican food
I spent a mint at Rosa Mexicano and I genuinely believe Zarela's is BETTER
GO!
I waited tables for years, so I know good service, and the service is excellent at Zarela's
The waitstaff is not only attractive, but attentive-despite the business of it all! The Margaritas are fantastic, and the food is great
You won't find any Tex-Mex on the menu, because at Zarela you will find TRADITIONAL Oaxacan Mexican cuisine
Zarela Martinez introduced (and I use that term advisedly) authentic regional Mexican cuisines to the New York restaurant scene more than 15 years ago and, although imitated (but, unfortunately, not often enough), she has never been duplicated
If she can't get the true ingredients, the dish goes off the menu
Among the appetizers, the snapper hash is probably my favorite as is the Pollo Escabeche among the mains, but there are so many wonderful dishes that it would be fatuous to begin naming them
I was astounded that goodtipper complained about the service; I've always found it delightful
The Margaritas are other worldly
Zarela is a fun, buzzing culinary delight
The waitress was unbelievably rude to my friend and myself when she realized that we were ordering appetizers as our entrees
She even had the nerve to make a nasty comment in my ear when she grabbed our menus from us
Whats more is that manager was anything but apologetic for the disturbing antics of his waitress and seemed to like he couldn't care less if we ever returned
The irony is that had we not lost our appetites as result of the disgusting service we received, we would have ordered--and SPENT--more since we went there in the mood to run up a sizeable bar tab! All they care about is turning over tables
Zarela has been my favourite for 10-12 years but it just doesn't cut it anymore
It's not I that have changed, it's Zarela that hasn't developed
The food is mediocre and the service is annoyingly bad
Last night the head waitress showed some irritation when we did not know what to eat
Suggest something i sad
But I thought you were ready she responded negatively
We are as ready we'll ever get - so suggest something I said
She continued then in a moaning irritated way But I don't know what you like - spicy or what
Listen, I said I guess nothing on the menu is dangerous, poiseneous or untasty - so suggest something
She did
But one shouldn't have to be succumbed to such treatment
And the chips are not that good either
On our last visit to NY we ventured into our dining experience at Zarela's
the mexican culture surrounded us
Every dish was filled with fragrant ingredients
The strawberry margarita stayed cold, slushy through the whole meal
The food servers were excellent, however, lacked the mexican culture
Their pronounciation of various dishes needed some improvement
Overall and excellent meal and we will dining there again next month
If you're looking for Taco Bell kind of Mexican, this is not the place to go
They don't have much in the way of your standard burritos and chimichangas, but they do have great fish, meat, fresh salsa and guac
The trout (recommended by our super friendly waiter) was great even though it's not my usual favorite fish, and the duck was amazing
We had immediate seating for our party of 6 even though we were missing 1 for 20 min and plenty of refills of the chips with fresh salsa
Go for the margaritas over the sangria and you'll have a great time!
The margaritas at Zarela will make your night more fun than you will even remember--don't ruin that buzz with their mediocre Mex
The only thing almost edible is the steak appetizer but its not enough food to satisfy a Mexican craving
The red snapper hash is a gloppy mess that is strong on the salt and not much else and the entree options leave much to be desired
You could look at this menu for days and still not find something that even sounds appetizing
Do yourself a favor and start your night there with a few drinks--but leave when its time for dinner
The food is at Zarela is spectacular
incredible snapper hash appetizer

sunday at JG melon
hungover
nothing better then a burger and those round french fries
cant live without it!!
I've had burgers from NYC to San Diego, Boston to Provodenciales, Los Angeles to South Beach, Acapulco to Annapolis and by far JG Melons' burgers kick ass, by far the best in NYC and probably top 3 in the world
No Contest!!!!!!!
Although there is a bit of a wait, JG Melon's has truly stolen my cheeseburger-loving heart
I've been to many other places around the city, but they just don't compare!
there is little dispute that jg melons and corner bistro are the top burger spots in the city
we provide a side by side comparison
staff: advantage melons (kitty is a sweetheart)
sides: advantage melons (cottage fries) decor: corner B (no upper east posers) drinks: melons (have kitty make the bloody bull)
burgers good for past 20 yrs-there are never any surprises!
Best Burger in Manhattan! Bobby Flay's old hangout
Try the waffle fries
they are to die for!
I'll only go the Upper East Side if I'm going to visit friends or go to Melon's for a burger
Call me crazy, but I love their spinach salad, too
Great jukebox
Simply the best hamburger in New York City
Accompanied with a side of cottage fries, a cup of chili and a cold beer, it is the perfect meal
And to all of you nay-sayers out there
Melon burgers are juicier and more consistent than those at the (dare I say) Corner Bistro
If you do not believe me, try for yourself
Great crowd
Great ambiance
A true New York institution
The best burgers in the city and lots of local charm
It is a small place so it tends to get crowded and noisy during dinner hours but its all part of the experience, have a beer while you wait and enjoy the atmosphere
Hands down best burger in NYC, great fries too
The people that work there are also extra special, you have never met a warmer staff
Its a real find that shouldn't be lost
if you ever wanted to see those upper east solcialite ladies chowing down on a cheeseburger, this is the place to see it
The burgers are juicy, if a tad underdone, but order one level up and youi'll get about the right done-ness
The chip-fries are also delicious, and the chili is a great option if you're not in the mood for a burger
ok maybe its a little crowded and the burgers have gotten a little smaller
But they are still the best
In Short Photographs of sun-dappled East L
A
taquerias line the walls of this colorful Park Slope after-work spot, coveted for its worldly sandwiches, affordable Tex-Mex and sunny sidewalk tables
The Chinatown (grilled chicken, spicy peanut sauce, rice, ginger slaw and toasted coconut) and the North Beach (portobello mushrooms, ginger slaw and rice in a spinach tortilla) are sandwich favorites, and anything on the Mexican front--overstuffed burritos, cheesy quesadillas--fares well
I love this place
work down the street and eat lunch probably twice a week here
It's affordable and the servings are quite big
The best horchata too!
Great cheap eats
Try anything from the special menu ($4
50 i believe) and getting a great filling meal
The Scene The interior of Ess-a-Bagel, which opened in 1976 near the northwestern edge of Stuyvesant Town, has all the appeal of a breakfast nook at a Howard Johnson's, with a chintzy chandelier dangling from a drop ceiling and green metal patio chairs for seating
You want to make something of it? This place is also about attitude--even little old ladies aren't immune from the scorn of the guys behind the counter
The Food The bagels are big and meaty, with a fluffy interior and a good hard shell of an exterior
They're large and flavorful enough to serve as a meal on their own, but should you want more, the counter stocks such essentials as chicken salad, chopped herring salad, eggplant salad and a whole range of cream cheeses and smoked salmon
The bagels are fabulous
We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking)
They are the best bagels I've had
Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo
The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC
Not only do they have the freshest and most delicious bagels in the city, but hey have the absolute best whitefish salad on earth!
my favorite bagels and c
cheese in the city
once the bagel was warm and my c
cheese was melting
So good I can taste it right now!
Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels
Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY
The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great
The lox is always fresh too
Highly recommended to all!
Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel
We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem
The bagel was huge
They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy)
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND
I grew up on these bagels
The staff is no nonsense
The food options rule
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store
the bagels are: big, brobdingnagian, colossal, elephantine, enormous, gargantuan, giant, gigantic, huge, humungous, jumbo, king sized, leviathan, mammoth, massive, titanic, tremendous, whopping
best bagels in nyc
always fresh and delicious
so garantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread, but all the bagles are unbeliavably good
For my money, these are the best bagels in the city
And the whitefish salad on sesame is without peer
Great bagels, great cream cheese! There's a long line, but the employees are so great that you don't mind waiting a few minutes
The bagels are always hot and fresh
I took my mom along for our first visit to Ess a Bagel on Mother's day
I wondered if we would get attitude, but the only attitude we got was pleasant
the man who made our sandwiches even wished my mom a happy mother's day
We both enjoyed our bagels and will be going back!
Unremarkable is the best word to describe Ess-a, which is unfortunate given all its accolades
The bagels themselves are simply average, certainly bested in consistency and taste by not only others in NYC (Pick-a-bagel by the 77th subway for one), but by *gasp* others in assorted suburbs upstate
Sure, they have some good toppings that combine with the decent bagels for a tasty breakfast or lunch, but simply considering the quality and taste of the bagels themselves, you can do far better
The service might be a little ruff around the edges sometimes (just think No soup for you!), but the bagels are amazing! I live in the neighborhood and I'm a devoted customer
Kudos to the whitefish, lox, and veggie cream cheese
The rice pudding is also a winner
There isn't a better bagke ANYWHERE! I can't see how anyone could even compare another bagel like HH, which are all so average

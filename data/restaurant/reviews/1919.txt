Then the waiter was rude and got our orders wrong
we felt as if he was mad that he couldn't hang out with his friends behind the bar
We complained to the manager, who could really have cared less
We had to ask twice for them to turn down the blaring music (because we had trouble talking to each other - remember, there was noone in the place!)
and they actually turned it up
To top it off, it was very bland mexican-style food
Definitely one place I will never go back to
I'd rather hang out in a Chipotle
I went into Senor Swankys
at about 6:30 and without even asking was told there was a great deal for happy hour at the bar
and that even if i wanted dinner
i should have drinks at the bar first
how nice
the staff told me how to save soem money
i like that
so after a few happy hour margaritas
we ventured to a atble where the same guy was our waiter
we ordered fajitas
they wew great and the service was even better
i had a blast cant wait to sit in the outdoor cafe and have it all over agin
counting the days till spring!!!
This place is terrible
3 of my coworkers and I decided to venture to Senior Swanky's hoping to cash in on HAPPY HOUR
We got there a couple on MINUTES before happy hour ended, and proceeded to ask the waiter if we could order the drink specials
He then VERY RUDELY told us that Happy Hour was over! We questioned him saying that it wasn't 7pm yet - and he said that his clock on the computer says it's too late
Meanwhile - the place was empty - so empty that you could hear crickets in the background! We would've stayed and had margaritas and food, but he was SO RUDE
mmmmmmmmargaritas
what else is there to say about this festive happening mexican restaurant
my coworkers and I wandered in there for after work happy hour margaritas
well we got there at 5:30 on friday after noon and didnt leave until 11:30 pm
wow we had a great time the servcie was grerat and not only were the magaritas tasty
they were also strong
we ended up staying for dinner and it was delicious and plentiful
we are planning another afterwork bash next week cant wait
It's called Senor Swanky's, so we know it's not trying to be a fancy Mexican restaurant
All I want is a decent meal and reasonable prices, but Senor Swanky's offers an average-at-best meal at inflated prices
I live a couple blocks away, and have eaten there a number of times--if you're in the neighborhood, go to Harry's, Panchito's or (if you must) Caliente Cab
Avoid Swanky's
i was at senor swankys for a bachelor party on saturday night
we had a blast
they put the college football game i requested on the tv right by my table
,
bonus for that one
our waitress was very cool
she helped me navigate the massive menu
and directed me to the fajitas
steak
yumm
and the black cherry frozen margarita was like eating an italian ice
except by the third one i was feeling no pain
lol
the food was great,,,and the service was fun
the waitress,sat with us and took a fun photo with us,,,and gave us all sombreros to wear
what fun
we all looked os funny that a group of girls joined us from the bar
some of us shared food with them
some shared drinks
some shared hats
and some i think shared a little more
lol
cant wait to go back
After visiting the uptown location of Swanky's, we figured the downtown location would be good too
We stopped by over the weekend and were excited to find outdoor seating since it was such a beautiful day
We were seated promptly by the hostess and then greeted by our waiter with a smile
Chips salsa were served immediately
I had a negra modelo and my friend had a frozen margarita
This is a great place to hang out for drinks and people watch as the location is perfect on the corner of Bleecker LaGuardia
We only had drinks but we'll be back for dinner soon
I was walking in the villgae on halloween night, and i walked by this happeing packed place, called senor swanky's i thought funny name
but what the heck
it was packed
but the host was great and he got us a table right away,,,, we found out later it was Senor Swanky himself who sat us
its nice to see that the owner still works in his restaurant and still takes care of guests,,,we had a blast
my party of six got great service and had a fun time
the fajitas were outsanding and the magraritas were delicious
im sad it took me this long to experience senor swanky's but i will go back again real soon
and tell my freinds about it too!!!!!
Really have nothing good to say about this place
The service was awful even though noone else was in the restaurant
Our food took forever, the waiter got 3 of the 6 orders wrong and then the food was below average - which is saying something for New York Mexican food
With so many other spots to eat in the neighborhood, there really is no reason to go to this place
My friends and I were in the mood for some good maragaitas and some Mexican finger foods
Boy were we dissappointed coming here
The chicken salad had chicken that looked like it was microwaved sitting on top a bed of lettuce and a hard avacado
The chicken was broiled and contained no seasoning, which is uncommon for a Mexican restaurant
The guacamole was even all wrong, they were made with California avacados rather than the more expensive Haas avacados, which gave it a watery taste and consistency
The drinks were supposed to be frozen but they were watery, not to mention watered down
The servers were in Senor Swanky shirts and tattered pants
I would definitely NOT recommend this place to anyone else
We have been to a number of Mexican Restaurants around the city and this is by far the worst
The service was terrible, the food was awful (and arrived in under 5 minutes so it was hardly fresh)
We will nrver go there again!
When we ordered our Margaritas, the waiter said $10, so we gave him a 20 and waited, and when he didn't give us our change, we asked and he said - Happy Hour's over, they're $10 each
OK, then why didn't he say $20? So I asked for chips and salsa, and he tried to give me a quarter full dish of salsa that belonged to the people next to us!!!! So disgusted, we didn't eat dinner there, but felt compelled to drink our $10 Margaritas
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone
My friends and I have walked past Swanky's many times before but had never gone in
I'm glad we finally checked it out
We sat outdoors to do some people watching
Their location is a great spot on the corner of Bleecker Laguardia
We each had a couple of margaritas whic were excellent

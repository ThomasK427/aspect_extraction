You ask for an official receipt and they don't give you one
A friend asked for a vegetarian dish, and they said they can't have the dish the way she wanted
It was something she has ordered from the same place before and when she told them that, the waitress told her that she has been working there for 15 years so she knows better
I ordered chicken pad thai for takeout
When I got it home after eating 1/4 of it I noticed more than half the chicken was never cooked
It was pink
Me being a level headed person I immediately took it back to the restaurant discreetly so I wouldn't disrupt the other people dining in the restaurant
The male server behind the counter tells me next time in order to get a refund I have to bring the entire portion back
Somehow this was turned around to be my fault
I demanded a refund and I told him to be careful next time
He then procedes to threaten me and tells me I better be careful
Is this guy for real
This place is a dump
I wouldn't even feed the homeless people outside of the restaurant their food
Unless you want to be throwing up all night
STAY AWAY
What happened to the Lunch Special? The food is great but they're getting cheap with you
They took away the lunch special
the drinks are now served in smaller glasses with lots of ice
Come on!!
I've been going to Jaiya for years and years, even before they opened up a restaurant in NYC (it originated in Queens)
I don't think there is a better thai restaurant around
It definitely can get spicy, order it medium and it'll be hot enough, but the food is extremely tastey
Their fish in Jaiya special fish sauce and Crab in Jaiya special crab sauce are to die for (both different sauces), and the chinese sausage salad along with Tom Yum soup as starters round up a great meal
You can never go wrong with the Panang Curry and Pad Thai
For vegitarians, the tofu in basil sauce is awesome
I recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food
The food here is excellent, the service wasn't that bad when I went
All the food came out in a timly manner, and they met all our needs
It was defintely not bland food, all you have to do is ask for it to be spicy and trust me, they will make is spicy
I was literally sweating when I was eating
Good place!
If you want to go somewhere for so-so food where they treat you like you're unwelcomed, come here
Very good food, distracted service people
Location a pain to get to unless you live nearby
If you like heat, Jaiya Thai is for you
The restaurant is not much to look at, and the service can be off at times, but the food with roast your mouth if you want it to
Seating can be a bit tight, but then again, the food is the reason to go here
Best thai in NYC? Maybe
Worst service in NYC? Definitely
We had reservations for 6, but two of us were running late
From the moment we were seated, the waitress harrassed us about taking away the extra seats
I ordered a chicken dish, she brought me a beef dish
Upon complaining, she said, Oh, I thought you said beef
Then she tried goading me into taking the beef dish
Towards the end of the meal, she started pushing us out the door as quickly as possible
There were people still streaming in the door, but the tables around us had been there since before we arrived, and not once did she ask them to leave
We are white, they weren't
Hmmm
Regardless, we requested a dessert menu, which she never brought, and the 15% gratuity was slapped on automatically despite our protests of bad service
To the people who complain the food is too bland, maybe you shouldn't chicken out and get all the food 'mild'
The spicy thai style soup is amazing, and will easily clear up any sinus problems you might have
The rest of the food is top notch and if you get it medium spicy, that'll be enough for most people
Easily my favorite restaurant in NYC
Yes, the service is a bit spotty, but the portions are of a decent size, and the cost isn't all that bad
This place is expensive, tiny portions, and the staff is not nice
The curries are very bland for Thai, and I suspect this place only gets business because there are not a lot of Thai restaurants in Curry Hill
They also charge extra $ for rice which makes no sense since it is the cheapest thing to make
This place is lame
The best thing about East is that it is perfect for small eaters or people who don't like eating too much of the same thing
Watch as food rolls around the converyor belt for whatever tickles your fancy
A really good roll I had tried was a salmon roll that was wider than usual, had a slab of salmon outside of the roll and was sprinkled with fish roe
Can't remember the name of it though
Prices are pretty low and sushi is good
A definite must try
Bottom line, East is a staple of my diet
I used to live on 25th 1st, so it made sense to go quite often, but now I live in Queens still go--that tells you how great it is
You can either have sushi conveyor style downstairs or eat in style upstairs
Private tables, quiet, but not too quiet
It's great for a first date--amazing food for really great prices!
I live nearby and have been at least 50 times in the last two years
Consistently excellent, fresh fish at a great price, but you've got to go when they're good and busy or otherwise selection and freshness quickly deteriorate
The price to pay; Japanese restaurants are always strict about timings anyway, and I can accept that for such great stuff
this is a fun place to go with your family or friends
if you're the type of person that needs to try all the flavors in an assorted chocolate box, you'll love to dine by the conveyor belt because you can try all the variety of sushi and rolls
Conveyor belt sushi--such a novelty
I thought it was really cute
There is a pretty high turnover so the sushi was pretty fresh
They probably make them purposely small so you can eat more
Prices are pretty reasonably
I think they have the cheapest take out sushi in nyc
Also, you can sign up for an annual membership where u get 10% off
Service isn't that great though
It took them a long time to take our order and refill our water
We opted to be seated upstairs because the downstairs looked crowded, and although it seemed like there were many people upstairs, seating was still very prompt
Very good atmosphere with lighting and personal rooms for tables
My boyfriend and I were seated at individual tables with another couple in the same room - so don't expect anything too personal! Food was DELICIOUS - we didn't have a conveyer belt from downstairs, but the menu is separated into sections and is very clear with pictures and good pricing
Our servers were very friendly, but there was quite a wait for the food to arrive - perhaps too many orders to attend to at once? In any case, the food was well worth the wait for its reasonable price
A New York sushi experience
This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC
Everything I tried from there tasted wonderful and their prices are just awsome compare to the quality of food I get
fast and pleasant service and quality sushi, just a perfect combination
My japanese friends love this place too
Sure if you never had sushi before this might be a place you want to check out
There is a conveyer belt that goes around near your table and if you like what you see you take the plate off the belt
The problem with this is that if no one picks up the a dish it just keeps going around the room till someone does pick it up, therefore the fish I ate here wasn't fresh looked dry even
If you wanna check out the cool conveyer belt going around the room I suggest you go to their window and take a look from the outside and get some real sushi elsewhere
If you love sushi, this is one of the best deals in Manhattan
The food is exceptional for the price
I had a wonderful meal with a friend for only $18

They serve traditional German dishes with mind-blowing portions that engage the eyes and mouth in a gastronomical enent that will leave you wishing you had a wider belt
The meat dishes are always served melt-in-you-mouth tender
The more American fare has a straight-to-the-point simplicity that is always done expertly
As expected, the beer selection is perfectly in synch with the menu
The staff works the place like a finely tuned machine
One of the best treasures Queens has to offer, serving up tough competition to the better Manhattan eateries
Great ambience, nice people karaoke nights with Jonh Thomas is a wonderful experince
Cooper's is a neighborhood secret
Only the priveleged know that you can get some of the best wings in the tristate area for pennies on Tuesdays

and oh, the burger
big, juicy, flame broiled
need I say more?
Hidden on busy Myrtle Ave in Queens, best thin crust pizza in NYC
Don't pass on garlic puffs either
Sugar buns been around for 30 years and I can see why
Besides making an amazing cheesecake, they have wonderful Italian pastries
My dad's diabetic so he loves the sugar free cookies and cakes which even I have to say are very good
The Waterview is one of the best diners I've evr been to interms of the quality and taste of the food
Their omelettes are great, drinks are never watery and the eggplant parmagiana rivals most italian restaraunts (and you get a lot more for your money)
My only complaints are that sometimes after a Sunday morning rush, it's not very clean and we've also had the repeated problem of finding things in our food from other orders
I'm a vegetarian, which I always mention to the waitstaff and the manager
I always end up with someone else's meat in my eggs
The diner is so good otherwise that I continue to go there, I just don't order omelettes
The waitstaff is inconsistent
Sometimes great, sometimes so so, but it is a friendly place and as I mentioned above the food really is great
Try the greek spinach pie!
Upon entering, you won't see any fancy-shmancy stuff
But don't be discouraged
Once you pass the pizzeria counter up front, get seated, and order your food, you'll be delighted
The food is one of the tastiest I've encountered outside of mom's home cooked meals
I highly sugged the tasty (greasy) Fried Calamari appetizer that's big enough for me to order as the my main course
As I just discovered the Chicken Francese (butter lemon) Stuffed Pizza
Absolutely out of this world
And while you're waiting, the garlic knots are excellent and the hot bread is the best I have EVER had
Two thumbs up for Lenny's!!!
The pizza is fantastic and service is friendly
I've been going for years, and think its best around
Best Pizzeria/Restaurant in New York City
The best Grandma Pizza, with the best sauce
If you dont want to go to IL Mulino, or IL Gilio in Manhattan, this is the place to come everyday for lunch or dinner when in Queens
The food is fantastic, with great size portions and real real flavor
Great daily specials, the pizza is amazing, the food is tasty and delicious
I love this place and I live in Manhattan
No pizzeria on Manhattan can compare to Ginos
Not even close

Went to Danny's the other nite for their japanese food on the 2nd floor and had AMAZING sushi!! It was fresh and the slices of fish came in good portions!! I especially loved the new chef lobster salad
My friend had the hibachi and it was really cool watching the hibachi chefs cook the food right at our table
Our mouths just watered when we smelled the food being cooked and our stomachs agreed that it was DELICIOUS!! A must try when you're in the QUeens neighborhood!!
This place is not your normal chinese restaurant in Queens
The atmosphere was very elegant and remindered me of the nice places in Manhattan
I was with a party of 5 and was greeted immediately upon entering the place
Service was very pleasant and prompt
The food is OUTSTANDING, I ate my face off
They also have a full Japanese restaurant right upstairs
Gotta try that next
Great food, good prices, and friendly and helpful service makes Danny's one of my favorites!!!   My friends and I went there and enjoyed terrific chinese food the first time and went back to sample the japanese food on the 2nd floor
Both times, we left very satisifed with the food and the service
A must try is the sushi and the grand marnier shrimp appetizer
The food was very good on our few visits to Danny's
Service was good but did feel rushed on a busy night
Overall I thought it was a very nice restaurant with very good food
I have been going to Vincents for over 20 years and the food is still consistantly good
They have great clams and the best french onion soup
But it's all about the sauce
They have a wonderful tomato sauce
The real treat is their extensive dessert menu
If you like peanut butter they make an amazing peanut butter pie
My fiance and I went to La Nora on a tuesday night for a quiet dinner
We got that and so much more
The ambiance is fantastic
Candles on the tables, cozy furnishings and music at just the right level make it a great dining experience
The dining room is cozy but not cramped
The food was fantastic! I had blackened salmon and my fiance had chicken marsala
We both agreed it was the best dinner we'd had and we'v been to much more expensive restaraunts
We did splurge on $22 appertizer platter and it was WELL worth it
Everything was so fresh and delicious and I've never seen a more attentive waitstaff
Picked up pizza - got home to find it was completely burnt - ice cold - looked and tasted like it had been leftover from the previous day - inedible
They shd never have sold this pie!
This is some of the best pizza arround i went to FL for college and the first thing i did when i came home was go to New Park for a slice
Heaven
Going inside this place is a wonderful place
My friends and I love to walk around with this area and enjoy the sights!
this old fashioned pizza stop has been around forever, it has a special brick oven that makes the pizza come out charred gooey with lots of cheese
the best i've ever had
Some of the best Indian food I've ever had
No ambience at all
Total hole in the wall
Really great, reasonably priced food
I recently moved from Kew Gardens to Astoria
As much as I love my new neighborhood, the one thing I miss is having decent Indian or Pakistani food to eat
Mehak was my favorite place to eat back in the day (last year)
It was a hole in the wall, but I'd order from there practically every week
Their sauces were perfect
The chicken vindaloo and the chicken saag were top drawer
Those guys were so cool too
There's a nice renovated movie theater around the corner that shows all independent and foreign flicks
The whole neighborhood is really quaint, too
I couldn't think of a more perfect movie and dinner date

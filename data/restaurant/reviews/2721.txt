Food as very good as was the service
Waiters very attentive
Tried some old favorites and new dish's and none disappointed
Will go again this time not waiting for special deals
This is one of my favorite local italian restaurants
It has an exceptional menu and always has daily specials that are to die for
The service is exceptional the staff caters to your every need
I have been here several times and i always enjoy my dining experience
And even though it's usually crowded i've never waited more than 5 minutes for a table
I went here on Valentine's Day
The food was wonderful
There are many places that you can really get great meals but the pastas here were to die for
The wine list was also above average to excelelnt
The service was even better
You drop a fork and ten people pick it up
Not to mention the staff really makes you feel at home
The prices are pretty good as well
Deserts are also wonderful
I recomend the tartufo which was gigantic and delicious
Definitely coming back here
One of the two older Italian gentleman who are always at La Stella will greet, seat and serve you better than average food at this quaint restaurant
The Italian music goes great with the excellent wine selection
A must visit for any Brooklynite
This is one of the greatest restaurants I've ever been to
Their food is excellent, their service is wonderful, and the atmosphere is amazing, but to top it all off, the employees are very polite and patient
The owners are especially accomadating and sincere people
I'm 100% positive that you will love this place
Yes, this place is good, a cut above some of the other local diner food and a nice, friendly atmosphere
The Irish Breakfast is fun to try, I don't know if it is actually a good representation or not
But where they shine for me is with the omelettes - their selection is very deep with lots of good combinations of ingredients
I do find that they are in no hurry to settle up with you afterwards, you have to be aggressive if you want to get out of there
Cant believe this place isnt rated higher
Husband and Wife owners are always pleasent and accomidating, food is top notch quality made with care, and now, recently renovated to accomidate more tables and a young fresh feel
Great place
Small and quaint
Food and service is great
Friendly atmosphere, the guacomole is delicious, the enchiladas are awesome, the margaritas are yummy but can be dangerous because they are so good
I've been going to place since last October, every experience has been a great one
There also a man there that plays his guitar and sings for you
This is the only Mexican restuarant in Brooklyn that is worth the money
If you love Mexican food and drink then this is the place to go ! From large plates of fajatas to huge margaritas, and unbelievably fruity sangria you will be in heaven (mexican heaven that is ! ) I love the complimentary hot salsa and fresh chips that they put on the table !  The staff is extremely friendly and make sure that you are having a good time
On the weekends they even have a guitar player !   VIVO LA MEXICO ! !!
If you haven't stoppeb by already, this place should not be missed
The food and wine selection is superb and the chef brings it all together each and every time
The Waitstaff and Management take pride in delivering quality
The dishes are delicately prepared, the chef's attention poured cleverly into each dish to make it special
The fish is skillfully prepared and trust me, you will walk away satisfied
Enjoy!
Great for all you can eat! If you like to pig-out on Sushi, this is your spot! There is a decent Sushi selection on the all you can eat menu
At first sight, you think you may need an attorney before agreeing, but I'm sure they have had their share of all you can eat scammers
The sushi is not like other all you can eats where the fish is tiny and the rice a huge lump
Prders come quickly
The staff is usually low in number, so you'll have to wait a bit to get their attention
The space is minimal, but clean and pleasant
I have told so many people to come here even my friend from Japan and we all love it, especially when we get the room for all of us to sit in our own little world eating tons of good sushi! Oysters are yummy too!
This place is great, that's all that needs to be said
The sushi is very fresh, the place is not noisy, and all for 20 dollars for all you can eat! I eat here regularly with my girlfriend
Some of the better choices are tuna, salmon, eel, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, and eel roll
You will get seated as you walk in too! Please try it, I am sure you will agree
all you can eat is of great value if u are not looking for above average sushi
Sushi pieces are smaller if u r a 'buffet' customer and choices are rather limited and there's really nothing special on the menu
They use plasticwares to serve 'buffet' sushi, soup, salad and green tea, which is totally inappropriate for japanese food
The place gets a bit noisy, it's definitely not that much of a romantic place
Waitresses are nice but the guys are not that great
they don't even stop at your table when bringing food
but above all, they do have fresh fish, especially salmon and yellowtail
they were delicious
in terms of service, atmosphere and food combined, i would say it's about average
it's still good place to go if u r craving for sushi but don't want to spend a lot of money
I'm a regular at this nice, clean restaurant
The service is great and the sushi is the best I've had in Brooklyn
came here for lunch one day
i'm not a sushi lover but my boyfriend is and he absolutely loves the sushi here
and the price is just right, $20all-you-can-eat lunch special
it's a great deal
i ordered non-sushi rolls and enjoyed my meal
definitely plan on coming back
This place serves tasty sushi and sashimi
Try their eel (Fontana Dancing Eel roll) and Spicy Tuna and Avocado salad
Also Kani and Figi Salads are extremely tasty
Prices are affordable, which in conjunction with good quality explains why it's always so crowded on weekends
This is the best sushi place ever great deal 20 dollar buffet
go here
I went to 101 w/my friends for a birthday celebration
I read some reviews that were less than glowing and was going to cancel and go somewhere else
I am so glad I didn't!   The food was outstanding as was the atmosphere
Special touch -- my dessert plate had Happy Birthday drizzled in chocolate
Run don't walk and try 101 you won't regret it
Although the place had an actual makeover not long ago, the food or chef needs to be changed
Bland, overpriced and just not as good as it was maybe 10 years ago
The food is fresh the place is fabulous
Best time to go is after work around 6-7pm, before it gets crowded
A beautiful bar area w/tables in the front then a separate non-smoking dining room as well
The service is always good as are the drinks and the food and at reasonable prices
Enjoy
I am not an expert on Indian food
All is know is that I had a delicious meal with the most incredible rice
There was a lot of food and it was all excellent
I went on a Monday evening and it wasn't crowded at all
Service was great

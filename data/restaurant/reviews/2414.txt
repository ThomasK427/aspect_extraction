The room is absolutely amazing and your jaw drops as soon as you walk in
It is the quintessential NY space
You certainly feel as if you have arrived
The fod was just amazing
I had the rib-eye and my guest had the Bouillabaisse
Both were outstanding
The service was suprisingly friendly
I expected some nasty cold staff who thought they were as cool as the interior
To my suprise the waiter was friendly and knowlegeable
He seemed genuinely interested in our having a good time
A lot of waiters are actors though, well maybe he's one of the few talented ones in the city
The only drawback for me is the location
I guess now I have a reason to get up there
foos was great
sushi was very fresh
must try the sea bass!!!!!!!!!! mixed grilled seafood was average service was also excellent!!!!
Brasserie is every bit as good as it was in the past with updated improvements! We were warmly greatly and promptly brought to our table down the now infamous runway staircase
New design is breathtaking -- love the tv screens above the bar to spy on the door! Our server was fun and professional
He guided us to the Onion soup (as good as it ever was!) and Foie Gras (served with baked Lady apple was a great combination)
We then had the Filet and 24oz Ribeye
Best filet in NY and a steal at $29
I never thought I'd say it but the Ribeye is better than Peter Luger's! The J Pinot Nior (waiter's suggestion) -- the perfect compliment to the meal
As for desert -- don't leave without trying the Chocolate Caramel Dome! This restaurant landmark is still a best bet for a great meal
From the minute we walked in and were seated we had an amazing experience
The scene is sooo New York
Great architecture
Our waiter was so gracious, fun, and accomodating without being obtrusive, (such a rare occurence in NYC)
The filet au poivre was as good as any NY steak house and the Mauritson Zinfandel was rich, spicy and a GREAT bargain at $58
Beautiful desserts and a glass of port (at the recommendation of our waiter) topped off the evening
The only better looking than the desserts was the manager
(Dana?! I think the waiter said
) WE we definitely be back weekly!
Wonderful business lunch, exceptional service and management was always on top of their game
Went here recently and I must say that it was a big disappointment
Simply put, the crab had no taste, the Mahi Mahi was very dry bland and the mix drinks were not done correctly
The two good sides were the sushi and service
Very friendly service
The decor was cool but I've seen many other places with more chic style and a bigger WOW factor
Would not recommend this place
my first time ,at brasserie was only for cocktail,those are hight recomended to try ,so i decide to come back for dinner
Outstanding,food was great ,service very professionel and attentive,really like the decor alsoo
BRASSERIE,will be the perfect place for  VALENTINE S DAY, i definitely want to go back there
Having sampled a few of the top restaurant's Restaurant Week offerings, I must say how impressed I was with Brasserie's
Not just a crappy salad and piece of chicken, but interesting and delicious selections like the Peekytoe Crab Cannelloni, and the Rock Shrimp Risotto
Service was casual and attentive with a nice array of different beverages
It seemed to me that all the other diners were pleased with their food, and with the bargain price
I've had a nice time at this restaurant
The place was busy, so we had to wait about 15 minutes at the bar before we were seated
The food was a touch bland, but certainly good
We have not sampled the wines, but I am told that their selection is excellent
I felt that in the effort to make the bathrooms look futuristic, they have actually made them uncomfortable
The service was good, and I would consider visiting this restaurant again
Immediately after we ordered our entrees, our polite waiter chimed in with So will that be a soup or salad
? Naturally, this roughly translated to: Would you like a soup or salad that comes with the entree you just ordered?  Much to our surprise, the barely there salad for the two of us came to a healthy $19 extra on the bill
The salad was average, definitely not $9 worth each
Nothing was sub-par with the experience as a whole, but we left feeling a bit swindled
Buyer beware!
warm atmosphare in a cold futuristic scene
the food is good but not that good
yet, I will recomand the plce to my friend
Good place for solo diners, because the service is so friendly and the doorstaff is accomodating
Everyone seems to want to be in the main diningroom, but the side room is candlelit and therefore more inviting
The food is good to excellent, especially the short ribs
This place is done up in a very contemporary minimalist style, almost reminiscent of the 60s (although I wouldn't know that firsthand)
It as very cool colors, the staff seems to have fun and enjoy their job, the wine list is very, very good
Overall it is a fun place to go and spend a few hours
Back to the Brasserie last week and the food just gets better and better
For such a large and varied menu, the chef does an amazing job of making many very different dishes both attractive and tasty
Service was polite, efficient, and accomodating
Excellent mixed drinks and a wine list filled with great value at the upper end
While doing an Instantaneous Transformation seminar around the corner last weekend, I ended up going 3 times in 3 days at Brasserie: once for dinner and twice for lunch
Our dinner of steak frites and Beaujolais nouveau was perfect
Our waitress immediately brought a baguette and really really good butter on the table, service was good, friendly and fast
My 2 experiences at lunch were just as fine
The menu is so diverse that I didn't have any trouble finding something new to try
The frisee with lardons was excellent, the croque monsieur too
The crab bisque lacked crab, it tasted more like a fish soup, but as a fish soup, it was great! We had an hour for lunch, and service was impeccable each time
A brunch for four last weekend was a disaster
Setting aside the interminable wait for food, the cheese omelet opened up on the way from the kitchen to the table so that when it arrived, it looked like a large yellow pancake with a slab of uncooked cheese sitting in the middle
Ditto on the egg white omelet
Tiny portion of runny whites with a few mushrooms thrown in
Packaged fries
Eggs benedict very ordinary
Salad Nicoise unimpressive
Burgers burnt on the outside, thankfully cooked to order inside
Onion soup tepid and not flavorful (what happened? it used to be excellent)
When waitress saw we had hardly touched the food she presented the check and said nothing else
Busboys were clueless
What are we tourists here? Drinks are overpriced; wine list is good
Unfortunately, since it opened Brasserie has taken a slide in the wrong direction
I made reservations at Brasserie since I had the Dine out NY $25 Gift certificate
The atmosphere is a bit stuffy but I guess if that is what you like
The sushi appetizer was fine but I had a seafood combo main course which tasted like it was still in the ocean
sandy, very fishy and not good
My boyfriend had salmon and had the same complaint
We both reached for the salt b/c the food had absolutely no flavor
Dessert - creme brulee was average
I tasted an aftertaste, very eggy
UGH
Oh well, I wouldnt dine there again even if they gave me a $100 gift certificate

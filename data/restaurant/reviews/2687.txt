I stopped in to try some pastry the other day and was leered at by the woman behind the counter, who yelled at me for asking for help, then proceeded to ignore me while she yelled at another customer
Meanwhile the waitresses stood by with disdainful looks on their faces while a few other confused patrons lingered by, waiting for service
I don't care how good the pastries are
NEVER AGAIN!
This is the best Greek dessert place
You must order their baklava
Very reasonably priced
It's right off the subway
Terrific baklava, galaktoboureko, walnut cake, and cookies at ridiculous low prices (at least for those of us used to Manhattan)
Atmosphere and service are so-so, though it can be an interesting cultural immersion experience
This is a new restaurant with incredible food
It's literally a hole in the wall, with one cracked table and leatherette stools held together with duct tape, but the food is outstanding
They've got the best Kung Pao, hot and sour soup, WorShu duck, fried wontons, mei fun and chow fun
I've ordered about 10 times and I've never had an 'off' meal
They are also well-priced, have speedy delivery, the food is fresh (they use real mushrooms, not canned), and they offer small portions of just about everything, including the Szcechuan meals
If you have enough patience to deal with the horrible service they have here then you should definately try their brick oven pizza
It is amazing
As is the bread they serve you before the meal
There is one waitress there who is absolutely miserable, lazy, and extremely unpleasant
After seeing us in there a few times I think she TRIED to be nice but was extremely fake
The busboy there is very nice though and partially makes up for her
I hope he stays around because he is the only one with class
Regardless, their only pizza is the only pizza I truly enjoy, real italian pizza
but just a warning- my boyfriend and I don't drink out of their glasses
Noy very clean
We are new to the neighborhood and wanted to try something new
From the outside this place looks cute, however, once inside loud as a disco! I have been a waiter for many years and I can tell you that if bad service is given you at least apologize to the costumer
Not here! The food was late and the waitresses turned away in annoyance everytime you tried to flag them down
All we wanted to know was where our food was
I suggest going there on a weekday when maybe they are not that rude
The food was ok, average, nothing bad nothing great
This is NYC so theres much better out there
You have to try it
it is amazingly thin
They also use fresh mozzarella, and they also give you a warm basket of focaccia bread to start
Try the house red wine
Only one thing, try to avoid the only male waiter they have, he is not good at all, blames his mistakes on eveyone else, lousy service from him, gives you the wrong change
I can go on and on about him
Just ask Gustavo, the bus boy, he will get whatever you need
the bomb is their best hero, all Italian cold-cuts on that large hero with a boylens black cherry makes for the perfect meal
The best thing is that they open at 5am so when you're done clubbing you can eat a real hero instead of those lettuce sandwiches from the city
Service is also real friendly and fast
Also the best 6foots for the superbowl
They have the best sandwiches! It's worth a trip from Manhattan
Their sandwiches are bigger than your mouth and range from $4-$5
You can't beat the price or the taste
I highly recommend this deli! Although it's always crowded, the service is very fast
Everyone and their father goes there
the heroes are enough for lunch and dinner
They taste just like the heroes I used to have in Philly as a littel girl
Thank you God for leading me to this spot!!!
AKA Sandwitch Kings of Astoria! Best hero I ever had!
This deli is something special
Makes better sandwiches then anywhere else
For about $4, you will get more food then you can eat
My fav is the Roast Beef on a hero
Cold cuts are fantastic too
I like the way they present them
You know it is good when the firemen, policemen, and corrections officers drive there to get lunch
This place earns its respect from its quick and affordable take out / delivery
Each time I come in, its busy and lively
While I may live only 5 blocks away, the delivery is consistenly no more than 15 min and the takeout wait time is roughly 5-10 minutes depending on how busy it is
Very common of many local takeout joints in New York, its strictly cash only
They are very flexible, plus since they are willing to make things for you that are not on the menu
Had dinner here last night and everything was delicious
The seafood was so fresh
Had grilled octopus and grilled calamari as appetizers and red snapper for the entree
Everything tasted as though it was caught that day
Very pleasant atmosphere, not a quiet romantic dinner
Owner/Greeter were very friendly
Great staff/service
Reasonable price
Make sure you get the dessert, you will not be disappointed
I feel like my grandmother flew in from greece just to cook for me
The fish is fresh and delicious
The price is right and the portions are hearty
Need nothing else
This place is not recommended on Saturday early evenings
Food was below average
Bread had a oil on it so it was messy
Village salad had a lot more cucumbers than tomatoes most likely because tomatoes are expensive in US and they want to earn more taking advantage of people who don't know about Greek food
It did not have oregano and peppers therefore it cannot be called village salad
It also had only 2 olives in the entire salad apparently for cost reasons
Service was not good
The people who were known customers had higher priority than us
Prices are average for this kind of restaurant
Finally the restaurant was too crowded and noisy (Saturday around 21:00), but hopefully that's not the case on other days
I only order the chicken and lemon potatoes here -- they are to be seen to be believed, so yummy, you crave them after a day or two of first having them
The owner/manager is a very warm and friendly person and treats you like he knows you
Classic Astoria, classic Queens, classic New York
This is the best seafood place in Queens
servings are plentiful and evey dish is delicious (except for the lemon potatoes)
The peasant salad is a must, as well as the calamari (my favorite) and the red snapper
You will not be disappointed
trust me!!
I love this place
very casual, a great value, a wonderful owner who treats you like the most valued customer even if it's your first time
my roommate and i love to go on a nice night and sit outside
the stuffed mushrooms are a must! enjoy!
This place has good food thats a nice value; but either out outside, weather permitting, do take out or stay away!! It was so loud and hot in this place

Good Spanish cuisine
I found it quiet and cozy
Food was well done (especially the bread!)
Can be romantic
Place has some decent food for some decent prices with decent service in a decent atmosphere
I don't mean to be vague, but nothing really stands out at all about this place
I've been going here for years and it hasn't changed a bit
The food and service is great
Very lively, loud, but fun
The place is too small for the amount of clientele, but once you get over it it's cozy
Perfect for a Birthday
Let's face it, you go (or I should say, I used to go) to Arthur's for an inexpensive but acceptable steak and a good cheap beer, right? I have been visiting Arthurs for many years and have been moderately pleased (with some few exceptions) with both
But last night, -I gave up
20 bucks for a piece of gristly, unchewable shoeleather called our Steak and a $7+ liter of beer is where I draw the line
It's was one thing when the steak cost 14 or 15 bucks with a $5 beer, but now it just isn't worth it
Either grab yourself an angus berger at Bruger King or save your $$ for a trip to a real steakhouse like Rothmann's or Old Homestead
You'll thank me
Or - go to Arthur's for old time's sake, 'cause this joint won't be around much longer serving this meat
If you like your steak au povre or tartar or any of the other frufru ways to eat meat, don't go to Arthurs
But if you want a good slab of steak cooked just the way you ask in a comfortable atmosphere with no pretense and served with a giant litre of your favorite draft, take a trip to the nicest part of Hoboken and visit Arthurs on Washington Street
You can order two kinds of steak at Arthurs: 24 oz
or 48 oz
They also do a great lobster and their rack of pork ribs is simply succulent
Don't expect much in the way of fancy sides
If you haven't figured it out yet, Arthurs is a meat-and-potatoes joint with limited variations
But if you go make sure you try the onion soup and try to save room for some killer pumpkin cheesecake for dessert
This place is good but it is not as great as everyone raves
The service is terrible and the food is just ok
The prices are good though
Look'g for a place close to homenot wanting to venture into N
Y
for a steak that costs 3x's as much
We decided on Arthurs, part of the Mile Square town a
k
a
Hoboken
Since it was the Thanksgiving weekend there was no wait
Service was good
Mixed drinks were Casino Quality we weren't sure if the sides on our tables were left from the previous diners, but when our steaks (Only one choice on the menu) arrived
it was truly meat and potatoes
The steak was seasoned well, nicesoft and the food was hot
We've paid at the more expensive steak houseshave not been satisfied
We even caught a movie around the corner afterwards
Would recommend in a heartbeat
Just don't get dressed up (unless you want to be part of the collage of patrons on the wall)be prepared to put your napkin in your collar like the YOcals
Arthur's is a great place to eat if you are a real meat and potatoes guy
The French Onion soup is probably the best I have ever had, and the steak, while sometimes fatty, is very good
The beer is served in huge Stein glasses and the side of potatoes is really good
Definitely worth the price and a good place to meet up
I have been to quite a few steakhouses and this is one of the best
I have eaten here about 20 times and I would have to say that I have always been extremly satisfied with the whole experiance
The 24 oz steak is $14
99 and I have had great cuts, seasoned perfectly, every time
Get a Big beer to wash it all down and a side of potatoes and garlic bread
I am very critical of resturants and Arthur's is no doubt a steaks lovers place to eat
The steak they make at arthurs is a good ol fashioned man steak
No prissy little decorations or any of that other nonsense
You get a big slab of meat and some very tasty potatos
The steak isnt the best, but its far from the worse
Much better than anything youll get at Outbacks, Houlihans, or any place like that
I highly recommend it
If steak isnt your thing, i sugges the Cod or even the Lobster
Fatty and tasteless huge slab of the grease bomb meat
Side of greasy diner potatoes, but tastey
Gross steak
Warm Welcome, Very attentive service,Great Food Any time of the year
Beutifull Area great choice befor your tour around town or the big city
In Short The original opened as a speakeasy in 1926, and the other locations retain much of that atmosphere, with deep velvet benches and wooden tables topped with white tablecloths
Alongside the USDA-prime, dry-cut steaks, the menu features standard steakhouse fare: appetizers like shrimp cocktail, fresh oysters and clams, an array of salads, soups, pastas and vegetable sides, and non-steak entrees as well--filet mignon, lamb, veal and pork chops, lobster and more
Valet parking, you'd never find parking on your own), nice hostess, decent waiter
Excellent steak
Quality meat and cooked to perfection
the Sirloin is the highlight of the menu which otherwise is pretty standard
The bill was $120 incl tip, but for a Tues
nite out well worth it
Sides are large enough to share
I was here with my boyfriend last week
We debated not coming all the way in from Staten Island but it was so worth it
The food was amazing and the live entertainment was the best! I will surely go back
I think it could be a fun place to come with a large group of friends
The food was great but the live music was an extra special touch
It made for a unique evening
I was visiting NYC from Charlotte and staying with some guys in Hoboken
The food was great, I loved the place, It was one of the highlights from my trip
My buddies took me here before my bachelor party because they know I love Steak! The service was terrific and the steaks were great
It was the perfect kickoff to a great night!
I went here for my cousin's birthday dinner last night
They were so accomadating to our large table and had many menu items to choose from
It was great to visit a place away from the post college scene on Washington
The food was great and my server was really nice
I think the food is phenomenal! This is the best cuban food I have had in this area
Their brunch is great on Sundays and all their dishes are delicious for lunch and dinner
I have tried everything on their menu and its awesome
Every time I have brought someone with me to the restaurant, they have nothing but praises for this restaurant
The service is pretty good and the people are friendly
The only problem is that its small and you have to wait for a long time to get seated
But you can always sit on the bar which is not bad
Thats what makes this place special
you feel right at home
This place is not for the ambience sake but its for the food

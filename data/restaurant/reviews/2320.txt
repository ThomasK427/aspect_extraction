I mentioned the mistake but was answered there wasn't any german riesling any more
I had the endives salad, the filet mignon and an assortment of desserts
Nothing interesting about the appetizer
The meat was good but the sauce too sweet
Desserts were good, nothing more
The wine list is poor and expensive
I thought I would find more refinement regarding the reputation of the place
I was disappointed
We went (10 of us) for a family Thanksgiving dinner, and sat at the Chef's table
I cannot describe how incredible this meal was
It began with an amazing bread basket, and salads
The chef then entered with a special treat: a vegetable soup/flan served in a hollowed egg shell
CRAZY! Then came the main course: I had venison (unbelievable) and some of the others had Filet Mignon, Turkey, or Salmon
All were delicious and beautifully prepared
After we busted our shirt buttons, the very accomodating and entertaining waiter came back with news of dessert
Their dessert chef was world famous, and when the treats came, man were we sure why he was
Frozen chocolate custard, Pear Trio (sorbet, flan, etc) and tons of other delights
This was one of the best meals of our lives, and we reccommend Park Ave
Cafe with much enthusiasm
WOW!
Given its location, when a generous, 94-year-old client invited us for dinner at this spot, we expected to have to suffer through a stodgy menu
Quite to the contrary! Innovative, tasty, architectural creations were presented by a competent, friendly staff
Portions are generous ( she took half of her filet mignon home), so be sure to leave room for the chocolate desserts, any one of which suffices for two persons
A rare plus: although the place was full, the ambient noise level was just a civilized, happy murmur, and it was easy for us to converse without raising our voices
I really like Park Avenue Cafe and I have been there many times and have always enjoyed my meal
I recently went and had the most amazing Arctic Char! Everyone enjoyed their meals and the presentation is great
The portions are perfect and the atmosphere is very nice
The desserts are also a must
The pastry chef is well known and creates some masterpieces
This restaurant is always reliable and not too crazy with the pricing
The service has always been good as well
Went during restaurant week, food was good
regular menu looked even better
Presentation gets an A, the chef is very creative
The decor is quaint, Americana but lacks in ambiance or excitement
Service was ok
A slightly above average place at above average prices
I heard a lot of great things and was excited to come here
Now granted I did come during Restaurant Week at 10pm
The wait staff was not attentive at all
In fact they were kind of rude and snobbish
The food choices for Restaurant Week were boring
The regular menu though did look great
So, overall I think the food was excellent but the atmosphere is more for stuffy, older types
Not young people like myself
I don't think I will come here again
But would recommend to my parents
Went there for Father's Day brunch and was very impressed
We were seated promptly and the service was very efficient and professional
The food was very tasty - though the portions were a bit large - 6 HUGE pancakes
I could hardly eat half
Regardless, they were wonderful
The bread basket is a treat and the mimosas were well done
The decor is very cute without having too much kitsch
My only complaint is that we were seated on top of the table next to us, but it was a holiday brunch, so I can't be too critical
There is something terribly indulgent about sitting at one of Via Q's bare, picnic-style tables and paying as much for a three-course dinner as one would at world-renowned Cafe Boloud, three blocks north
And yet, the experience is incredibly satisfying
The pasta is consistently perfect, and the house salad one of the best in the city
If you're dining solo, you will feel completely at ease in the cozy environs; in fact, you're likely to see at least one other solo diner hunched over a book, sipping a glass of Chianti
Please note, however, that this review only applies to Via Q after dark; during the day, this peaceful oasis is rudely besieged by strollers, cell-toting real estate brokers, and Madison Ave power shoppers
Fell in love with this place the first time, but the second time, I was insulted, offended and embarrassed because I was accused trying to walk out without paying a measly $20 tab (we not only paid the tab but had left a generous tip)
If I wasn't with a friend from out of town, I would have been my loud and obnoxious self and told them what they could do with their $20 tab and would have taken my tip back
You can't beat this little known beauty
I recommend it for a quick breakfast or brunch
It has the appeal that only pure authenticity can bring, the same attraction that I feel in Florence when I see that oh-so-perfect cafe around the bend
At long last, an authentic Italian Caffe Bar/Ristorante here in New York City!!! The coffee is exquisite, pastry, gelati, all superb! Whenever I miss Italy (every day), I head for this place
Oh, as for the reviewer who complianed of high prices, fondue that conisted of bread and peas, and the old rich people eating poor food; try the Olive Garden over in Times Square
It's full of young people eating inedible food - this place is obviously wasted on the likes of you
I shared the Vegetable Soup to start, and I sampled both the Tentazione and Barbagia
What an excellent lunch
The soup was light and greatly complimented by the beautiful olive oil drizzled bread basket
The Tentazione was so delicious, the proscuitto/shrimp/pink sauce might sound weird but it works
The Barbagia, although might be a little too gamey for innocents, is pulled together with the red onions-the melted Camembert is so rich and sinful over the venison proscuitto
Service was also great
The espresso is as close as you will get to a real Italian espresso - the ambiance is authentic, and all of the waitstaff is charming, italian, and eager to please
It is pricey, but given the location that is not surprising
It is more desirable to go on a weekday during the day - the weekeknds tend to be overrun with folks from out of the neighborhood
We had lunch at this adorable little cafe and loved it
You can grab a quick espresso gelato at the front bar, or sit in the back to have delicious Northern Italian treats like bresaola and arugola panini, carpaccio, or even lasagna
The special tiramisu was the cherry on top
The prices were reasonable - we plan to go back! On a sunny day you could get lucky and sit at one of two tables outside
I love this place
It is best for prelunch and lunch! so cute
their sandwiches are a must! the previous reviewer must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed when he went
I have never had a bad experience, and believe me, i know my food and my restaurants!
Ok, it is very cute restaurant
Food sucks
I went there with two of my friends to have fondue dinner
It was about $30/person (2 people minimun) for fondue
Fondue has breads and kind of vegetables that you get at cheap diner
So we ordered Fondue and a Paella ($22), and it only had bunch of green peas
I expected more stuff in it
I ordered regular coca-cola, and they gave me diet coca-cola
Only rich looking really old people were there that night eating poor looking expensive foods
only breads and peas
I will never go there again
We wasted $70 per person for breads and peas
This place has so much charm! We sat at a little table tucked away in a corner in the back and had a full view of the restaurant - very cute
The food was really good but I wouldn't recommend this place to picky eaters
My only two complaints are that (1) our server was a real space cadet and kinda inattentive and (2) the sodas were really small; overall, though, I had a great time and really enjoyed my dinner!

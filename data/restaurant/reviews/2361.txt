If it seems like I'm nit-picking, it's only because I want to make it clear that this is an ordinary establishment, and that its reputation is not currently well-deserved
I visited this restaurant for lunch
The decor is beautiful
The service is very effective, but not fawning as some reviewers have described, and I am glad it's not
The food is very good, from the dumplings to the beef and lobster
I am told the alligator entree is not good at all
However, I enjoyed everything I had
Apparently, the apple pie is out of this world
This is certainly some of the best Chinese food I've had
Of course, it's also the most expensive Chinese food I've had
Despite enjoying the experience, I won't normally come here unless I am on an expense account or I want to impress someone
I have been to Shun Lee West and was excited to try the east side location
We were sorely disappointed
The staff had attitude, were slow to take our orders and we and the tables surrounding us each waited 30 min
to get our checks
Adding to our frustration was the exceptional service that regular patrons were receiving
Aside from the service, the food was OK
The soft shell crab was good, but not spectacular, the fried dumplings had obviously been frozen and thawed and were not reheated properly
Our entrees were the best part of the experience - the Grand Marnier prawns were very good and the sea bass was cooked perfectly with a nice sauce
For dessert the almond tofu was nice
For the high prices, we expected better service and more interesting dishes
I don't know if the people who have written some of thesereviews have ever dined out before?! Someone called the food 'not unique'
Most of the dishes on the menu are not served anywhere else,and those that are where served first at Shun Lee
The sauces are divine and the quality is near perfect
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Prices are through the moon for the chintzy portions
A sea scallop appetizer is $15
00 and consists of 2 scallops horizontally sliced to look like 4
The quality of the food is lousy and most of it was greasy
The service was snooty and spotty at best
Rude at worst
This may have been a classy place 2 decades ago, but for my money I'd rather go to a greasy spoon in Chinatown and be treated well
The elegant dcor of this restaurant makes it a great place to impress clients
Unfortunately, the hopelessly average food leaves everyone disappointed
The decor is beautiful, a nice blend of tradition with contemporary style
The full choice menu covers traditionally found dishes to ecclectic dishes
The presentation is extraordinary, and the food is better
All worth a sampling
I wish I could have everything in one sitting
The service is great
Knowledgable and attentive wait staff
A little loud, needs music
I was just reading all the poor reviews about Shun Lees and oddly my experience was completely opposite
The staff was attentive and amazing and the food was delicious
I felt like we were being completely taken care of and pampered
I couldn't find one thing to complain about
We did dine early in the week so perhaps weekends the staff isnt as personal or something
My office is around the corner so many times we will order take out late night from them and that is even amazing
I recommend the hack chicken appetizer and the duck entree - delicious
I saw some of the past reviews
KIller
I went there last night for a corporate dinner
Our captain was fantastic! She reccomended all fabulous dishes
The lbster XO was great as well as the peking duck
Definately try the soft shell crabs as an appetizer
The prices are a little high but , for authentic food, its well worth it
Let's just say, the Peking duck is extraordinary
The service is extraordinary
This is some of the best, most authentic Asian food I have ever had
I highly recommend it, should you have the means
Wonderful Restaurant, go to Din Sum (spelling) side of retaurant
Shun Lee Palace must cater themselves to the food critics because I certainly can attest that the service isn't for the people of the town
I've lived in Manhattan most of my life, but I felt I got better treatment from Big Wong's than I did here
The hostess was rude, my waiter was even worse and by the time I finally ordered and got my food, it was lukewarm
When the check came, I was actually happy to pay the bill
If I spent $50 to learn a costly lesson, so be it
I will not be coming back again
this restaurant used to be 1 of my favorites, but over the years, has gone downhill
the food isn't unique or satisfying to be unreservely honest, prices have increased (it's not like it was mid-priced to begin with), AND somehow Shun Lee has managed to hire an even more snobbish staff
save your money (and your appetite) and go elsewhere
A DISSAPOINTMENT
The snobby wait staff have no idea that getting water or tea should not take longer than 45 minutes
I ordered the roast duck and I was given duck with onions, a platter of 95% onions with 2 pieces of duck meat mind you
Portions are tiny and not unique
The dishes are are aim at people who can't tell distinguish authenticity
an insult a New Yorkers everywhere! Oh, don't expect to get your tea or water refilled for under 30 minutes
they took my tea kettle and never came back
The environment was an air of snob or snob wannabes
Good food is to satisfy your taste buds, good environment is to satisfy your comfort, and good money spend to satsify the entire value of your meal
Shun Lee satisfy none but the feeling of being cheated of a good meal
Confucius should have said, Better a humble home with hearty food than palace with a hollow menu
There's Oscar De La Renta china but the proof is always in the food that goes on top of it
I had dinner here per the invitation of a friend who works in the area
The food is okay tasting but what a let down for such a chi-chi establishment
I've had better meals in little less known places in Chinatown that makes you swoon for its real authentic cuisine
What you get is a dressed up version of food that you can make yourself and the carved animals out of veggies is small consolation that you ponied up serious moolah for a less than satisfying meal
I had to grab a hotdog on the corner when we left the palace
It lives on its past reputation and the owners friendship with influential food writers
I find the quality uneven quality and the staff indifferent except when pushing uninteresting but expensive dishes
I eat there with fans of the restaurant who order the same dishes they've ordered for ten years
I think the interior, while baroque for a Chinese restaurant, is passe
I really think people rave about the food to justify the cost
the food was good but there are better places to get good chinese food for less
beware of all duck dishes except for the peking duck
did anyone try the beggar's chicken?
food here sucks
too americanized and not subtle and exquisite as chinese food should be
The food
Delicious
The service

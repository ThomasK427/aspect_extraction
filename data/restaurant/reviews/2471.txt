Go, but with managed expectations
Great food, good service, comfortable atmosphere
Good place to go with a group of friends (order family style to sample more dishes!) Attractive prices too (entrees under 20$)
Personally, I'd suggest the duck dishes :)
Great, flavorful food
Speedy service
Nice, casual atmosphere
Upper Westside location is perfect
Is this what passes for tapas on the UWS? I couldn't understand WHY there were so many people in there
It tasted as if all the parts of the dish were cooked seperately and then thrown into the same bowl, only moment before serving it
We had to add salt to everything
None of the flavors melded together at all
We were in the mood for tapas and sangria on the UWS, read some reviews, and went to Luzia's
We really blew it
The homemade crab cakes were clearly out of a box and the chorizo was dry and served with yellow mustatd (at a tapas bar?)
Don't waste your time with the ham croquettes; you're better off with mozz sticks at the bar next door
Plus, there may or may not have been booze in the sangria
All in all, it's not worth it
Foods fantastic,Bartender and waiters welcome you and Al the ower is always there to help
These guys are great
I say is the best kept secret in NY
I stumbled upon Luzia's about two weeks ago, and I love it
Granted, there were a couple of cons
Some of the entrees are overpriced (not all)
And the first time I went, they were short in the kitchen
To make up for it, however, the bartender served us a bottle of wine, no charge
He's also Cuban and makes the best mojito I've ever had, as well as incredible champagne sangria
Also - the tapas menu isn't overpriced
Try the croquetas or the jamon serrano and manchego cheese (both are true Spanish favorites)
The churrasco is fantastic as well
I've heard that Luzia's ownership changed hands within the past couple of years
so if you haven't been in a while, go back - the food was great
And I hear they have Happy Hour from 4-7 pm Monday-Friday with free tapas
In response to an earlier poster, this is NOT a spanish tapas place!!! It's portuguese -- that's different
Anyhow, the brunch here is killer -- cheap, FABULOUS french toast -- fat slices with fresh fruit -- to DIE for and totally cheap! 7
95!!! Ditzy but friendly waitstaff, cheesy/campy decor -- great bargain
Beats the hell our of a lot of the more pretentious UWS brunch spots
One night, I got a craving for paella and headed over to this place with a friend
What a mistake
The rice was right out of a box (and undercooked), the sausage was too salty as were the shrimp, lobster and clams
I was disappointed
My appetizer of shrip in a garlic wine sauce was very good
For a Spanish tapas restaurant, it was a bit expensive and the wait staff were a bit rude
If you have a craving for paella and live on the Upper West Side, head downtown
The atmosphere of the place is nice as well as the location, but I found food mediocre and too expensive for the quality offered
I do recommend it for the 'ambience', for good portuguese food try others
The Scene This easygoing Upper West Side hotspot attracts hip local moms as well as the cool college set
They come for the impressive selection of beers, killer margaritas and perky (if overwhelmed) waitresses
Those seeking quiet inhabit the sidewalk seats, while rowdy revelers retire inside for blaring music and shots at the bar
The Food Ultimately the menu is just glorified bar fare: burgers, wings, chili, California-style pizza and Mexican favorites
Yet the salads are fresh and tasty--especially the Oriental chicken salad, which boasts crunchy Chinese noodles and a tangy, orangy dressing--and the mole sauce on the Mexican dishes is creamy and chocolaty
Tasty homemade apple cobbler a la mode comes in a tall, sundae-style glass
This place used to have such a great atmosphere and a friendly staff that always made me laugh with their quirky sense of humour
That was unfortunately the main thing that made me come back often
I've taken quite a liking to all of them and was disppointed to see all of them leave at once
I'd follow them into any of the new venues they work at because they always made me smile!! As for the place they left behind- it's slowly declining in all aspects
Hopefully, someone will see what's going on and fix it
Well I've seen a few reviews saying how bad the service in this place is and I totally disagree
I live in the neighborhood so I eat at the Firehouse alot and the service there is excellent
Whenever friends visit me from out of town, that's where I take them to dinner and they also like it because they also ask to be taken there
So, to those who complain, maybe it's the way you treat the staff that makes them that way towards you
This is the best place to be
The staff was very helpful abd quick
They were always avaible when ever I needed them
The buffalo chicken is the best pizza i've tasted
Also the buffalo wings are just great
The waitress are very courteous and professional
They are very attentive towards their customers
I love this place
It's a great place to hang out and have drinks
i love this place because i can sit down and eat with my friends and watch some sports also
the food here is great and so is the service
I live right around the corner from this place and have eaten there many times
I always sit on the patio because I like to watch people walking by
I think they have the best wings in town and I have tried wings at a lot of places
I also enjoy their buffalo chicken pizza
If you're looking for royal treatment by the staff, this isn't the place for you
I have NEVER had good service there
The waitresses seem to be unconcerned and slow
Surprisingly, the manager was the same way
If the wings and beer weren't so good, I'd probably never go back
Oh, and don't try ordering wings for delivery, because they always arrive dry and overdone
I don't know what you guys are talking about
Great party feel and the Bingo on Wed
pure fun
The chubby manager I met was great, him and the staff accomodated my softball team and friends with no problems
We felt welcome and will definitely be going back for the best wings, oh and the cute staff
The firehouse is a great place to just hang out and feel comfortable
they have the best wings in the city and the best house shots around
all for a lil price
i strongly recommend this place to anyone who just wants to hangout with friends/family and have a good time
The food at Firehouse restaurant is so so good! My friend and I started with the nachos
The nachos of red and gold corn tortilla chips with salsa, black beans, and the two cheese
Then we both ordered pizza
My friend had four cheese pizza and I had the BBQ pizza the taste was amazing and the food was fresh
I had so much food for such a great price
The chicken burrito was huge and I didn't even get to finish eating the whole thing
It was really good
With that I had a side order of sexy fries
The firehouse restaurant is a cool place to hang out at

Service is a bit lacking too during busy lunch hour
I usually go to Haru for sushi when in the Times Square area, but I thought I'd try Hakata Grill tonight for a change
What a pleasant surprise! The space (while somewhat hotel-like) is intimate and calming, and the service efficient and friendly
I felt like there were three different people attending to me, which is infrequent at these prices
I got the $25 prix fixe, which included salad, very passable (though superfluous) salmon tartare, forgettable shrimp shumai, a fresh and plentiful sushi entree, AND ice cream for dessert
The green tea was complimentary, to boot
To risk sounding like an ad, you just don't find sushi this good at prices like these in NY
I can't speak for their hot entrees, but I will definitely be back to Hakata in the near-future when in need of a sushi fix!
This is a great place to go for a good Japanese lunch
This is not somewhere I would go on a date, nor would I suggest going if you are looking for a trendy or fancy kind of sushi place
It is, however, good food for a good price
and their ginger dressing is fabulous
since this was only a few blocks from my office, my colleagues I gave it a try
we were greatly un-impressed
nice clean restaurant with modern decor, but the food is just so so
the sushi is actually not very good (we suspect it isn't very good quality)
even tho it was very crowded (sounded like a lot of regulars) we would rather recommend Raku on next block down or Blue Chili
Raku's sushi variety of menu are excellent
Blue Chili's pan asian selections also very good
so we gave it try, but it's Raku or Blue for us
truly pan-asian - a good variety but not traditional japanese
after reading the reviews, i had expected better
i know morgan stanley staff do a lot of deliveries/pick ups but i think it's mainly because they offer gift certificates for frequent buyers not because their food is that good
it's just ok
the sushi was a little disappointing, rolls ok
had better spicy tuna elsewhere
their noodle dishes are fine
SUM IT: try it once to judge for yourself, but don't read the hi reviews until after you've been there
better to order delivery/pickup so you can rack up the 'points'!  also, svc could be friendlier
lunch is crowded
We enjoyed Hakata Grill
The waitress was extremely nice and pleasant
The atmosphere was very warm and inviting
The sushi was great
We both had the Sushi set which included more than enough pieces
Miso soup was tasty
The prices are comparable to anyplace we've been in the country to get sushi
Must go for anyone who loves authentic Japanese food
Great food, service and ambience
Amazing background music
Very romantic
Ate here last night for first time was pleasantly surprised! Excellent sushi service, atmosphere a cut above NY's typical bright-light sushi places
To be safe, make reservations - we dropped in at 6:15 on a pre-theatre night almost couldn't get a table, but the hostess was very nice and juggled things around so we could stay
I'll definitely be back!
A really good place that is NOT overpriced, in the heart of Times Square - a SHOCKER! Hakata has great atmosphere, excellent sushi, and good waitstaff
What more can you want? Hakata is also great for a group
I love this place
The sushi was great
it melts your in your month
my waiter sucks
he was unattentive
but other waiters start helping out
so we were being served by a few people????? the overall service was good
Great sushi, melt in your mouth tuna and yellow tail
You must try the Hakata roll
Veggie sushi choices were creative and NOT run of the mill
The restaurant could use some TLC but didn't detract from the wonderful food
Needs a larger cold saki selection
perfect spot for pre-matinee luncheon
the sushi is fresh,but the salads,dumplings starters reveal a special creative touch
I can't wait to try the dinner menu
I'm almost afraid to mention the extremely reasonable tab, since it may belie the quality of the food
the owner/host is the best , making his diners feel special
you gotta try hakata
jbarie
This so-called Pacific Rim restaurant actually serves mostly Japanese dishes
I had a fairly decent bento box
Given the amount and quality of the food, it was a steal for $18
95
Nice service and bistro like atmosphere
Highly recommended
I had to arrange for a 7 person dinner so I took a chance on Hakata
As I walked in I was so pleasantly surprised with the modern and clean atmosphere
We ordered sushi and entrees and everythign was delicious
The sushi was the freshest I have had in NYC
The service was impeccable
They didn't bother us even after we sat for a good 45 min after we ate to talk
This restaurant has very good, very fresh sushi
A wide range of choices, very affordable
and the staff was very friendly
The interior is very airy and everything is done in a light wood, giving it a tranquil feeling
The only downside? This place doesn't serve dessert
I kid you not
So make sure to grab the mints on the way out
The Scene The team from nearby Druid's transformed this historic spot from shabby old-man's bar to polished pub without sacrificing its 1868 integrity
The original bar, carved from a single tree, remains intact as does the gorgeous mahogany paneling, tile floor, and tin ceiling
The hard-drinkers and dockworkers who once frequented the spot would surely be surprised at the new, well-groomed young clientele
The Food Despite the interior's spit-and-polish, stick to hearty favorites like the Swiss cheese-smothered filet mignon on a bed of buttery mashed potatoes and the creamy New York cheesecake
There's even a bar menu with burgers and shepherd's pie in case the old regulars stop by
Some of the artfully arranged New American dishes, however, feel out of place
Good quality, whiskey-cured gravlax stretching from a flatbread "tail" seems too fussily formed, and while the scallops in the seafood plate satisfy, the lackluster swordfish skewers and overly dense crab cakes disappoint
A perfect pint, with a shamrock in the foam, proprietor Donnchadh O'Sullivan knows how to pour the Guiness and keep the customers happy
We had lovely food and talk at the bar as we soaked up the atmosphere at this wonderful old NY tavern
Families, fresh off the Intrepid were enjoying the burgers and shepherd pie
Something for everyone
We'll be back
I only recently heard that this great place was under new management
I gave it another try, and it was great! The food was fantastic, the service great
I was happy to see the Landmark restored! The bad service and drunk managers are gone! We can all go back!
Here's what I like about Landmark: old New York feel, good menu that goes beyond the standard Shepard's Pie offerings but doesn't attempt to be too hip, beautiful old bar with no TVs, perfect lighting, and a charming and hospitable owner/bartender with a lovely Irish name I can barely pronounce

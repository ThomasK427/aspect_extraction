The only bad points were the stuffy maitre d' and the loud and pretentious table next to us (but that's not the restaurant's fault)
Just go for the food--it is exquisite, rich and light at the same time
It is wonderful for special occasions, and worth every penny (and you will spend many of those)
Fleur de Sel is on top of my list for the best French restaurant in the city
The food is amazingly phenomenal (the fois gras with fresh apricot puree and crispy poussin with mushrooms is to die for)
The deserts are amazing (kudos to the young pastry chef)
The service is very attentive and don't be surprised if the chef comes out to chat with you
Best wine list in all of the downtown area
This little hideway in the grammercy area will leave you feeling like you are in Paris afterall
My partner and I have eaten here several times since it opened and we have never been disappointed
Eric Mongno works wonders in the kitchen and the pastry chef is so talented that your a fool if you pass on dessert
The room is small which is great when you are tired of the mega-mall sized restaurants on Park
Great service, great food
we'll be back for more
small portions
I left there hungry
You need to eat before you go
The Setting The exposed brick and tangerine walls, flickering candles and tiny bar cast a formal mood across this cozy Park Slope trattoria, but the high ceiling fans and two glass walls (left open in warm weather) add a casual breeziness
Tightly-packed tables stay full far into the night, making the ambience of this local favorite more hospitable than haute
The Cuisine Sotto Voce's lengthy Italian menu showcases the kitchen's successful interplay of flavors
Crab cake antipasto, for example, gains piquancy from pimento cream and cayenne-spiked sauteed corn, while perfectly cooked homemade fettuccine is enlivened, rather than overwhelmed, by a delectable rosemary-scented cream
Meat dishes, like the tender veal medallions and pork loin over garlicky mashed potatoes, are simple and well-prepared
The fluffy Italian cheesecake ends the meal on a sweet note
Sotto Voce is one of the nicest restaurants in the slope, its pasta is always al-dente and cooked to perfection, their sauces are always creamy and not too heavy
Their spinach pesto penne is to die for!  The first time i went to sotto voce, we had a great meal and the waitress came over and gave us free limoncello shots that was from italy, and she said they were homemade
I love their lunch special, its $8 and includes a salad/soup/caprese salad, and pasta or meat special, with coffee/tea
The brunch is $12 and includes unlimited pound cake (homemeade) and mimosas, and complimentary OJ
I highly recommend this restaurant, its always packed but i never wait more than 5 minutes for a table, i love it!
I love this restaurant
I won't say I've loved every dish I've ever had there (I've had almost all of them) -- I thought the fettucine bolognese was a bit bland, and occasionally they neglect to put enough sauce on the pasta -- but overall, I just adore it
If you like chicken, the Pollo Portobello is amazing
Other great dishes: the eggplant and fresh mutz pasta, the fettuccine with chicken and artichokes, and for brunch, the french toast
Plus, I've never had a dessert there that didn't make me want to lick the plate
The atmosphere is warm and romantic, not stuffy, and the food is reasonably priced -- and much better than at a lot of the higher priced restaurants in the area
The service is also really good
Even when it's very crowded, the maitre d' tries to keep you informed of what's going on and when you'll be seated
The place is a gem
My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it was delightful, delicious and fun
Plus - we were sta next to Steve Buscemi - a Park Slope local
GREAT night
I enjoy the brunch at Sotto Voce
The partions are large - I mean 3 eggs are 3 eggs arent all chicken eggs about the same size? The salmon plate I sampled was covered from edge to edge with salmon - plenty more than the bread that was provided
I love the pound cake - sweet, crumbley and buttery, obviously made in house
Being a sucker for bloody mary's, I enjoy my Sundays at SV
Great outdoor space and great location but MEDIOCRE food
Brunch portions tiny
and my friends and I went twice, giving it a second chance
Don't be tempted by the unlimited mimosas/bloody mary's
They ran out of most of the specials one evening for dinner
There are so many fantastic restaurants in the neighborhood why bother? I'm surprised by the great revues
I've been dining at Sotto Voce for a few years - always great Italian at a great price
For a tiny space they are big on hospitality and service
Overall they have a great selection of appetizers and creative entrees
You can't go wrong
Tired of 5th ave, I walked up the slope with some friends to this little (almost cramped) trattoria on 7th
I have to say, it was worth the walk
I had a well executed Osso Buco served with soft polenta - a traditionalist dish at it's best
My friends had a fish special and a rolled pork roast in a puff pastry with a cream sauce that I thought was quite innovative
The wine list could use some help but at that price point
what do you expect
Desserts were yummy - a thick not too sweet apple pie and a lighter than air tiramisu and a perfect espresso - short strong like it's supposed to be
Like so many regulars at Sotto Voce, I love it! The food is consistant as is the friendly and accommodatingwaite staff
If you are new to parkslope, this is the best place for your dining needs
If you've been a parkslope resident for a while and have not been to Sotto Voce yet - What Are You Waiting For!! The Prices are low enough to eat there ever day
I'm ready to turn my kitchen in to a walk-in closet! Try the seafood pasta when even it's available - yum

sottovoce gets it
from when you walk in till you leave you are pampered by the staff
The food was excellent, ask the waiter to ask the chef for his secret specials not listed
one thing i would improve is the wine list but other than that i loved it! def recommend
My wife and I decided to try, without making reservations, on the last night of DINE IN BROOKLYN
The maitre d' informed us of a wait of less than 30 minutes which held true despite it being packed
He did acknowledge us every so often so as to let us know we were not forgotten about
The place was very noisy and tables are very cramped
However, we decided to order off of the Dine In Brooklyn special $19
55 menu and we were more than pleased
I had bruscetta appetizer, chicken francese and sauteed spinach
It was all above average and not skimpy considering the price
The warm chocolate cake for dessert was very good
Of course, with this being New York, this is not the best Italian
I do think it is well above average and we will probably be returning there
the slope has to offer
I've been going to SV for 4-5 years now and I can say that like a fine wine SV has just gotten better and better
Sure it's had it's off nights, but the staff more than makes up for it with their pleasant and freindly way
I was so happy that they now tha CC's Now I eat there 3 times a week
Sotto Voce's lunch menu is a real bargain
At $7
95 ( ok 8 bucks - I hate when they do that ) it sure beats Micky Dees! Where else can you sit down and have and appitizer, main course and coffee at that price
I like the Farfalla Salmone, nice and al'dente
First of all, my wife and I come to this simply authentic Italian retaurant whenever I do not cook; and boy do I cook! From the moment you walk in you are made to feel at home when greeted by Amed the maitre d'
He is one of a kind and does everything possible to make you feel at HOME
We love nothing more than to have him sit with us
Ditto that for Mario, ( an owner and chef) and all the waitstaff including the servers
How many ristoranti do you go to and get greeted by kisses on both cheeks!  The food is above all else consistant ( how many restaurants can boast that?) beautifully presented and never wanting
Oh
almost forgot, Sotto Voce is so simply good and the people so warm and sincere that guess who catered our wedding?!
I took my fiancee here on valentines day and we had an excellent restaurant experience
We were not rushed, the waiter's were friendly, it was romantic but yet social and inviting at the same time
The food was very good and the value was exceptional for a NY restaurant
Only down side was it was a little squished in there, but what do you expect on a big night for them (valentines day)

We had dinner on Friday, 04/29/05
March far surpassed our expectations! Truly! It's quaint, romantic, with excellent service and the food
wow
amazing! Amedeo, our server, was well knowledged not only in the food, but the wine pairing too
We can't wait to go back
After losing our reservation the staff at March called 24 hours later to apologize and ask if we would still like to dine there
After some debate my fiancee decided he still wanted to go, he made the right decision
The staff was truly apologetic for the mix up, the service was fantastic and the food and wine pairings were unbelievable
In the end March lived up to all our expectations of what high class dining in New York City should be
This is one of the quintessential dining experiences in New York
The food is wonderful, the menu allows you to experience all different food options and combinations
Save room for the walnut tart
it is wonderful! Everyone should treat themselves to this place at least once a year
Great food, excellent wine, friendly and helpful service
Prices in the stratosphere, be prepared to spend 2-3 times what you might in other places
The area where our group (of 5) was seated was cramped
While the ambience of the restaurant was romantic, it wasn't so for the two people in our group who were seated on the outside perimeter of the table, as the servers kept bumping into them
Typically, in top-notch restaurants, the waiter would mention the specials beforehand
In our case, the waiter mentioned one of the specials as he was taking our orders - it was too late by then since we've already decided what we were going to order
One of the desserts on the menu was a molten chocolate cake
I was disappointed when it was served, as it was actually a brownie-type cake - this was totally different from what I usually get in restaurants that serve such dessert
For the amount we paid for the meal, we could've gotten much better service and food elsewhere
This restaurant exceeded all my expectations
Excellent service, beautiful ambiente, innovative food, simply superb
Best Tuna I ever had
Interesting wine list with many reasonably priced choices
Yes, March is expensive but well worth it I enjoyed every minute
Tonight we were very excited about a private party
The food was good, unfortunately the service was very disappointing
They were not sensitive to our needs and dinner was unusually long (well over 3 hours)
When we did complain, it was clear it fell on deaf ears
In fact they continued to pour wine and serve food at place settings where our guests had left
We will never host a party at this restaurant again
Our dinner at March didn't do it for us
After being seated we sat sipping water for an easy ten minutes before getting any meaningful interaction with our server
When she came, she was very pleasant and polite but not overly knowledgeable about dish preparation, wine options, etc
At this level, I want my servers to know more than me about the food and I didn't get that sense
The food itself was all very good to excellent, but not at the level of breathtaking one should expect from a restaurant of this purported caliber
Some wine pairings were off (I'm always skeptical when the same individually matched wine is poured with two very different dishes)
There wasn't anything wrong with the meal, and parts were quite good, but in a city like NY there are too many better options if you're willing to drop $200+ a head for dinner
March is occasion dining in the purest sense, and my 30th birthday provided just such a reason to visit
I was not aware of the restaurant until we arrived but in some ways I hope that it remains that way as this joy should be kept suitably exclusive
The six course tasting menu with wine pairings was exquisite, the seafood pefectly complimenting the heavier meat dishes
The poached lobster and scallop ravioli excelled whilst the lamb and the smoky duck were outstanding
Sizes got larger with each course and left us feeling full but not stuffed
Service was impeccable, and the environment exuded quiet class
The love-seat seating at our table was an acquired taste, but ultimately made it easier for us to share our numerous different dishes
Not a cheap experience but the overall experience does arguably provide value for money
Roll on the next cause for celebration
We went to this restaurant with great expectations: the expectations turned into a major disappointment on almost all counts
The decor was pleasant, but the tables were way too much crowded for a restaurant of this presumptive caliber
The choices on the menu were very limited-discounting raw items, there were practically no appetizers The foie gras de canard was mediocre with a syrupy sauce
We ordered duck medium cooked, emphasizing that we did not want it rare -it came rare and cold, after a 35 minute (!) wait
The service was solicitous and polite, but inattentive: there was no apology or explanation offered for the delay, not even a waiter in sight
Perhaps this place was better some time ago -now it is but a ridiculously-outrageously- overpriced, pretentious fake - a restaurant to avoid
I visited March and Jean-Georges same week
At approximately the same price, Jean-Georges won hands-down
Don't get me wrong: the food was pretty darn good
But for $200 a head I expect perfection, and March didn't deliver this
We had a seven-course taster with wine pairings
Some dishes were superb (lobster); some good (veal); some a little odd (beef with Japanese cucumber)
The wine pairings were expertly crafted and well worth it; probably the highlight
Lows: Service was somewhat poor; waiter seemed to lost interest part way through the meal and didn't know the wines back-to-front
And the space seems like it was decorated by someone with lots of money but not much imaginiation
Great food, great wine, and impeccable service went hand in hand for our party of 7
Definately get the 5 course tasting menu with the wines
The best in New York City
Amazing multiple course meal will leave you satisfied but not stuffed
The problem with spending $125 per person on dinner is that one expects something exceptional
March was merely good
Out of 5 courses, only 2 could be classified as excellent
We were a group of eight and afraid to speak as the room was so quiet
We were afraid to disrupt other tables' conversation
I would not eat there again
The food is superb, and you will not find a more delicious foie gras
We had the chef select extra courses for us, and we were not disappointed
The dessert sampler is a MUST
I was warned about the price
The quality of the food and the exceptional pairing of the wines was so outstanding that I thought the bill was VERY fair! We spent $300 for a satisfying meal (no, not fill your gut with 32 oz
porterhouse) and top picked wines that gave us a nice buzz
NOT romantic because tables were too close together
Not a great ambiance (no music or attractive decor)
Overall a good culinary experience
Disappointed since I heard great reviews
way over priced for good food but not amazing food
wish i had listened to the reviewer before me on how 'mediocre' things were
i would goto daniel or jean george for the same price
and its not that romantic of a place so i dont know what people are talking about
Past visits were never remarkable (good or bad)
Since it is known as a 'special occasion restaurant', I decided to try again for a birthday
We arrived on time for our reservation, and were forced to wait 15 minutes to be seated (at a mediocre table), where they placed a bouquet for the birthday girl
The service varied from friendly and attentive to haughty
(Being stuffy and pretentious does not make the experience any more august)
The food is good, but not great
To start the meal the beggars purses are delicious
After that nothing else measures up
The waiter recommended I choose a bottle for the entire meal
This would have been fine except that, especially for a restaurant prone to airs, the wine service was too lackadaisical and while the wine list is reasonably priced it is rather brief and uninteresting
What an amazing birthday dinner (expense account style) We had truffles with egg, 125 year old brandy and an incredible wine tasting dinner
I even commented to the waiter (who needed a laugh) that the meal was orgasmic!

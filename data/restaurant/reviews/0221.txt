I wen to Bukhara with a couple of my indian friends
and i have to admit we all had an awsome time
The food was fantastic
I really like the decor
as a student of interior designing i was fasicanted by all the tradtional look
the wood furniture really brings a lot to the place
Our waiter was a very down to earth person
Even though it was busy we were seated by the waterfall seating and enjoyed a couple of drinks while waiting for our table
well that is all good time over here
i should bring my Gf here sometime
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks
As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here
I am happy i did the food was awsome
JUST AWSOME
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey
but overall i give it a 10/10
Bukhara grill is my Favorite Indian restraunt in NYC
whats not to like about it
The decor is one of the most beautiful decor i have seen
The wooden furniture is awsome
The service is awsome very nice staff
There is also a beautiful water fall/ seating
There is a terrace seating in the spring and summer
The best thing about Bukhara is well the food
Dal Bukhara is my favorite Dal
also the chicken makhni, the Pickled Mushrooms, lambochop and the all the kababs are reallly tasty
I took my boss to the restraunt and he fell in love with it
I usually try to go with my girlfriend atleast twice a month
Very Romantic place
And the owners are both down to earth people

I love love love this place
It is the only restaurant that I miss now that I live on the West side
I have even paid an extra $10 just to get them to deliver to me now!! It is the best priced, best tasting Indian food that I have tried in the City
I dream about the Dal Bukhara
The service is always very attentive and, when I lived over there, they knew me well and would make the dishes the way I liked them
Definitely worth a try because you will go again and again

Only Indian that charges astromically for the basics that are sually inclided free with the meal
like yogurt! Major nickling and diming going-on
The brunch is not the same :-( No array of desserts
Besides, they used to be much more accommodating when I used to request a jalebi paratha instad of a plain naan as part of the brunch price
Where's your spirit Bukhara?! Also, BUT PLEASE USE LESS OIL IN YOUR GRAVY DISHES!!
Omigod great
100% North Indian (not Central Asian despite the name)
The lamb chop (Adrak Ki Chaamp) and the Dal Bukhara lentils - best best best in the world
Service people seem to be mainly from Nepal and they are ultra-sweet pleasant guys
The owners are also around, two guys who actually worked at the original Bukhara Grill in New Delhi and both very sweet too
I think the chef is also an owner and it shows
The White House ordered its Devali (indian holiday celebration) dinner food from here - the owners told me they took all the food all the way from NYC!
I took a friend visiting from India here, he'd never been to the states and missed Indian food a lot
He loved this place, so it must be authentic :)
I did too, despite not having the authenticity to compare it to
The service is wonderful, there's a beautiful back balcony that's wonderful in the summer and spring, and the food can't be beat
It is rather spicy, though, so ask for low spices if you're wary of that
the atmosphere was good, the food was good
but the service was bad on this day, i waited for an half an hour for my food, then another 15 minutes for the bill
The Buchara Grill takes a different approach to Indian Cuisine
The decor and setting felt as if you stepped out of NYC and into India
The shrimp is amazing; the chicken is incredibly flavorful and spicy; the naan was delicious
My experience at Bukhara Grill is always great
beautiful enviroment
the best food
great service
i try to go atleast twice a month
I love sitting by the waterfall
I have checked out the buffet here several times, and I love it! By the way, the aloo tikki in the buffet is very cold
Recently, I decided to get a take-out
The food was horrible, and for $50 just for take-out, it was very expensive
I had placed an order well in advance, and had to wait for about 20 minutes extra, but they threw in a free dessert, which was yummy
But I will not go back here, unless I go for the buffet
I have gone to Bukhara Grill several times myself and have taken out-of-town friends there as well

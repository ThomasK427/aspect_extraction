we waited patiently until two hours went by
admidst our wait, a couple who walked in and were seated
witnessing this, we asked for our table to receive the waiter's reprimand of how he didn't want to deal with us! followed by a forced comment of your table is ready, IF you want to stay!!  we declined and simply left
the place was rude and unprofessional
we highly advise you to think before visiting
service was horrific! not recommendable at all!
Give this one a miss
Tasteless food in tiny portions, at $10 for an appetizer and $20-25 for an entree, this place was a complete rip-off
I went with friends and ordered their signature dishes which were appetizer dumplings (greasy) and tuna (tasteless) and my friends who had steak said that was overcooked and bland (despite it being advertised as being marinated)
Very very disappointed
Never again
My husband and I fell into this place after a long day of Christmas shopping
Every single dish we ordered was delicious, the venison was tender and great portion size, the Sweet Potato was absolutely to die for, and even the greens on the plate were the most delicious I'd ever had
The atmosphere was romantic, our waiter was knowlegable, and so friendly, he even brought us dumplings on the house! We'll definitley be back to this gem
This is a fantastic restaurant
The food is beautiful and delicious and the servers are attentive
It's a good place to go if you're looking for a quiet, romantic evening
They have a large wine list and also excellent coffee
The menu is short, but the food makes up for it
It's very cozy and I will definitely come here again and again!
while shopping in Nolita one day, i stumbeled upon this very elegant, yet cute and charming locale, the kitchen club
when peering into the windows, i was greeted at the front entrace and handed a postcard for the restaurant and invited to come in anytime
and indeed i did just that
i had a wonderful meal in this intimate yet lively setting
finally fusion food done well!!! i especially loved the miso marinated steak with huckleberries
and for dessert and wonderful linzer torte
served on this amazing plate, and coffee in an even more amazing cup -- food and style, like it was something we think about fourteen hours aday, yet pull of like it was how everyone dined!
The service was gracious and the setting cozy and warm, but this was the blandest food we've had in a long long time
The food deserved muchwas lower than the Zagat rating of 21 it received
Never had we had such mediocre and boring boring boring food at such high prices
Overcooked seared tuna and spanish mackerel
Salmon and steak were OK
Sides of tasteless veggies of purple cabbage and bitter mustard greens did nothing to enhance any of the entrees
So, contrary to the previous review, we applaud the service, but the food gets panned, especially at $20+ per entree
Overpriced, unimaginative food lacking any flavor or subtlety
It was a real disappointment and we will likely not return unless, maybe, they get a new chef
To start with the positive -- the food and decor are excellent
Now for the negative -- this place had some of the worst service I've ever experienced
The waitress took forever to take our order, we waited almost an hour for our appetizers, and then she asked us whether she even put the order in -- as if we would even know
Throught the meal, it took forever to get her attention and she forgot to take our dessert orders
Several hours later, I just asked for the check and got out of there
When I got home, there was a message on the machine because the owner realized that our waitress forgot to charge us for our wine
I couldn't believe that they had the gall to call and correct the bill after such an awful experience
Good food, but not worth the price or the poor service
The place is the old Elizebeth Street Cafe housed in one of the oldest buildings left standing in NYC
The food was truly good
Jen had the ribs, Routh had the chicken and I had the shrimp in a coconut sauce
The grilled ears of corn are served with a lime wedge, the yucca fries are nice chunks of yucca fried to a light golden brown perfection, and the frozen pear mojoito was fresh and minty
Even the sides of fresh green kale were delicious
The place is a little noisey at 8pm on a Friday, it's a bit cramped but there are a number of great little nooks and outdoor seating as well
Great for a romantic adventure or for a small party
The service was polite, attentive, not overbearing or intrusive at all
We had a wonderful, tasty time
What a sorry bunch of amateurs they have working in this place
It's hard to believe those people work for a tip or that they expect you to leave any with the mediocre service they provide
Is the owner of this place brazilian for real? They can fool people that don't know better
But I'm from Brazil and from the same city she claims to be
Let me tell you, they can pull brazilian food like that in NY, but back home I wouldn't give the food they cook to my dogs
It has to be one of the worse dinning experiences I have ever had in New York
If you value your money, don't go there
I drag my friends to this place for a snack every chance I get
I usually just order a couple of sides, which is great for me
Very easy atmosphere, but not great if you're in a rush
We ate here last night and thoroughly enjoyed our meal! The beef was slightly flavored with curry and was delicious as was the little 'cheese breads' appetizer
And the best flan we've ever had! The only drawback was that this Brazilian restaurant does not serve caffe con leche
we were shocked, and even more so as the mediocre waiter, tried to tell us that a latte is the same thing as caffe con leche
??? The busboy agreed with us, for the record
but being that the lack of great coffee is the only drawback, I still recommend dropping in here for some great South American food!
We had dinner here and the food was absolutely fresh and wonedrfully prepared
We had the beans and rice, cheese bread, corn with lime, and the yucca fries, and everything was great
The beans and rice I highly recommend
It comes with grilled heart of palm and fresh and tender kale, roasted zucchini, squash, and sweet potatoes sauteed in a great sauce
Everything was fantastic, and the menu had so many options to choose from! Although a little out of the way, if you're in this neighborhood, grab a bite to eat here and get some gelato at ciao bella around the corner
Small area but cheap little place
Great for first dates
Staff wasn't as bad as other reviews say
maybe I caught them on a good night
Candlelite at night
very romantic
Place looks rundown, but apparently it' nostalgic
Check it out
This is a quaint little spot with a few outdoor tables
perfect for lunch or an early summer dinner
The food is tasty and the sangria is amazing! I highly recommend checking it out
Three friends and I went on a busy Saturday for lunch
Although the service could have been more attentive, the staff was definitely friendly
I found the small restaurant cozy and cute-perfect for a weekend lunch
The food was a mix of sandwiches, salads and appetizers that were mostly healthy and had a nice Brazilian touch
It's a great place to take a small group of friends with different tastes
We all left very satisfied!
The food was mediocre, the service was abysmal
Absolutely awful
The place was not even busy, yet the staff did not even bother to ask even once how things were
It took them 50 minutes to bring an order of french toast and an omlette
There are sooo many great restaurants in this City - spend your cash at one of them and NOT Cafe Colonial
The worst service I have ever experienced
This was the first time I actually left zero tip
It took about 45 minutes to received my eggs
I had to chase down our waitress for the food and the bill
After handing over my credit card, she forgot about me again

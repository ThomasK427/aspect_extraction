overall, a great place to suggest it to all my friends visiting brooklyn
What a pleasant night it was! Some friends brought us into Brooklyn knowing that we're found of French Cuisine and we had such a great time that Bouillabaisse just become one of our top 5! We were seated in their so charming and homy garden where smooth live French music was playing some old French songs
The service was very nice and helpful regarding the interesting wine list and the blackboard menu
The food was excellent my friends had a succulent and so fresh Wild striped bass, the Bouillabaisse was different from Marseille but excellent, I had the roasted Organic Chicken (with crispy skin) served with some yumi glazed shallots
The dessert, some balsamic strawberry over vanilla ice cream which were obscure at the begining but maybe one of the best thing I ever taste
The manager recommand the wine for us and we even had a little wine class while drinking some rare, unusual but so great stuff
Sad to say, this was one of my worst dining experiences ever
I had eaten many times at Bouillabaise when it was on Atlantic Avenue and had good memories
We were seated in an area of the backyard that was very dimly lit, so that is was very difficult to read the menu
Service was slow and disorganized
The cheese platter was good, diverse and generous, though accompanied by an odd guava garnish
The beet salad was overdressed and very garlicky, so that you couldnt taste the greens
We waited over an hour for entrees, without attention or apology, even as patrons who arrived after us were served appetizers and entrees
After we decided to pay for our wine and appetizers and leave, I approached the overstressed chef/owner, who was hostile
The whole experience was very disappointing
Slow service and excellent food
The bouillabaisse is not the one served in Marseille, but different with a lot of work to do until eating
A recent party for friends took us to Bouillabaisse
Not being a fish-lover, I had an excellent filet mignon It is however a place for people who like fish
They accomodated our large party, and the waitstaff was helpful
I returned on another evening with a single friend, and again found it a treat
The filet was NOT on the menu, but my friend had the bouillabaisse, which he found delicious
The waitstaff recommended the perfect wine to go with our meal, and that was because she was one of the owners, and had purchased the wine herself from friends in France
I live in Manhattan, but would definitely travel (by car, unfortunately, it is not too near any subway lines I know) to it again
I would recommend sitting, in the rear lower dining room
as it is more comfortable and quieter than the front area
Food here is amazing
Everything seems very simple, classic and perfectly executed
There's nothing new here, it's all about great ingredients and great cooking
We tried the poached pear with gorgonzola and the spinach, endive, tomato and chevre salad for our apps, both were just right to get going
For our mains we had the seafood combo, which is basically a bouillabaisse for those of us who don't like saffron, with a tomato base; and mussels mariniere with a garlicy white wine broth - ideal
We also had a bit of a succulent lamb shank with dates
Nothing here is overpriced, the service is excellent and the space is so comfy
Plus you can't beat the romantic location near the harbor
I've only been here once and had the seafood gumbo and not the Bouillsbaisse
However, I thought the food was great
There is a leafy quiet garden in the back that would be great for a date
Plus, there is a good selection of inexpensive wines by the glass
It's always worrying when the title dish of a restaurant falls flat
The seafood in the bouillabaisse wasn't fresh (it had a strong fishy smell), and while scallops were undercooked, the cod was overcooked
Both the seafood and the broth were bland
Perhaps some of the non-seafood dishes are better, but the bouillabaisse definitely wasn't worth the price
The seating area is nice, particularly the garden area, but the service is uneven at best
I am accustomed to French restaurants cropping up in my neighborhood and other people raving about them
All but two have been lost on me and this one - which given it's predecessor I had high hopes for - followed suit
In fairness, I can only comment on the brunch - but that experience is enough to keep me from coming back
The seating is cramped, the service was at best inept and at worst rude (we had several players and none seemed to be able to take the order correctly) and the food was truly mediocre
There are far better places in Carroll Gardens to have brunch - including the diner
The Scene With its bamboo fixtures, wooden benches and tables, flattering saffron lighting, and accommodating, personable service, owner and chef Lan Tran Cao's neighborhood Vietnamese spot balances tradition with modernity
An open kitchen creates drama in the rear of the restaurant; up front, groups of friends can linger over bottles of wine
The Food The menu features soups, sandwiches, noodle dishes and at dinner, full entrees
While the banh mi here is double the price of its superior Lafayette Street brethren, pho lovers will find a fragrant beef noodle soup that, while not nearly as generous a portion as is normally served, tastes of fresh Thai basil and long simmering
Even better is the bo nuong, char-grilled beef over rice noodles
But Lan's shy spicing leaves most dishes, including chicken stew with coconut milk, eggplant and lime leaves, and perfectly tender short ribs, just short of great

A lot of these so-called review are written by Vietnamese folks and it simply doens't make any sense to me
Most Viets would not eat out in Tribecca and you would read between the lines
most of these Viets critics folks gave it more or less samke kind of reviews (?)  2
The owner (Lan Cao) claimed that she has worked at restaurant Bodard in Saigon
Hmmmm,I grew up 2 blocks from the original Bodard and let me tell u this
there was no VC allowed to live in Saigon, let alone working in one of a well-known cafe! I guess that why we (the Southerners) lost the war to those Commies :( 3
She also claimed on the restaurant's website that she has owned/operated 2 restaurants in Sydney-Australia
Well, guess what she didn't mention the names of these restaurants (?) Here comes the kicker, ladies and gentlemen
I went to HS/College in Sydney for 7 years and my Viet's friends (in Sydney) and I couldn't find her name anywhere in Sydney ! 4
And last but not least, for your reading pleasure, I shall present you all the final nail for the coffin
you can read all about this Lan Cao lady at shamelessrestaurantscom (courtersy of her chef) I am just tired of all these people trying to take credit as restauranter for something that they know nothing about
It is an insult to my culture and my profession (I am a FB Assistant Director for a major hotel in Soho)
It's time to stop these so-called restauranters/liars from misleading the public
FYI: Bao noddles (Michael Huynh) is another moron that spent more times kissing up James Beard Foundation than learning how to cook or should I say
stealing recipes from a clueless Vietnamese cook in a little Viet's take-out joint in Queens ! Feel free to email me for really good recommandations of any Vietnamese restaurant in Manhattan
Just remember, most of these places would have 3 to 4 great dishes on their menus
In the mean time, don't let these fools telling you a bedtime story :-)
We ate here Saturday night; the place was busy, a little loud, the wooden benches were slightly uncomfortable
But the waiters and hostess were very nice and didnt appear hassled
The appetizers (crispy spring rolls, Ha Noi pillow dumplings) were pretty good, but the entrees were outstanding (Bo Nuong, and pan seared red snapper with crispy tofu, cilantro, fresh tomato, basil, lime sauce I could drink the sauce!)
Banana Flan for dessert was excellent as well
I will definitely go back; I want to try everything on the menu! Ill be eating here often during the Tribeca Film Festival for sure
I found Viet Cafe around the holidays and have been back many times since
The food is truly excellent, unique and tasty, not to mention the great wine selection
I specifically recommend trying the crispy spring rolls! I would recommend this place to anyone
This is now my new favorite restaurant in NYC
My co-workers I have been to Viet Caf twice and have really enjoyed our experience
It had a soft glow from the lights, a certain coziness aspect to the restaurant, making for a very amiable environment
The food was delicious and the portions were an ideal size, not too large, yet not at all undersized
Additionally, all of our meals arrived to the table steaming hot and right on time (We were impressed by the large selection of vegetarian cuisines!)
The prices were also very reasonable, including all of the prices for wine
We were greeted with wonderful servers each time; they are helpful and pleasant, but not intrusive
The servers were also very well-informed and were able to make great recommendations
I have no doubt that we will be back again
Last month, I enjoyed a friend's celebration with 10 people at Viet Cafe
Not only was the service very attentive, but we were certainly not disappointed with the great menu and food presentation
Our party was able to have a leisurely meal with appealing and tasty dishes coming out throughout the evening (I especially enjoyed the Caramelized Salmon)! Paired with a great wine list, Viet Caf is a restaurant in NYC that is highly recommended
Wonderful in every way! I have been to Viet Caf numerous times and have never had anything less than an excellent experience
There is almost always immediate seating if not, the bar is fun to sit while you wait! The food is innovative and mouth-watering; try the lemongrass crab cakes and the duck rolls
The decor is trendy and fun, without trying too hard, and the lighting is subtle
with a dim amber glow
Viet Caf is great time with a date, a group or just by yourself!
I just ate at Viet Caf for the first time and I absolutely loved this restaurant
I went with four other friends and we had a great table in back
The noodle dishes, Spring rolls, and salads- all had excellent flavor and were great to share

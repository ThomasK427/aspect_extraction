Just don't go in, keep walking until you hit Crispo's or another place with a less talking parrot parading in the restaurant in her bicycle, telling you all her troubles
STAY AWAY
Told us we needed reservations, we arrived to 3 people the whole night
Walking into Cynthias, Cynthia hersrlf welcomed us and offered a romantic(and it was) corner table for two
We loved the jazz
We shares the mussels appetizer they were so great and the sauce soaked in the delicious bread divine
I had the hanger steak cooked to perfection and my date had the chicken i really could not decide which was better
Cynthias mashed potatoes so very good i can not remember any better
we skipped desert to full but  I will go back soon
Everything about this place was wonderful
We ordered lamb which was perfectly cooked and tasted awesome
I find that most Kosher restaurants are average to good, but this has been the best I've eaten so far
The only drawback is that it's a little pricey
This place is just as fabulous as all the other name bistros, but no lines, no attitude
It's romantic and food is great
I'm hesitant to even write it up lest it get crowded from the buzz, but it's such a great place I had to weigh in!
My friends and I wanted brunch on a suffocatingtingly hot Sunday in the city
Deux Amis provided a nice respite - cool, calming, pretty inside with authentic waitstaff (read: french-speaking) and very good authentic bistro fare
Everything from the eggs benedict to the mussels and even the hamburger were done well and very tasty
There are many french bistros in the midtown area, and I wholheartedly recommend this one
I went on a date with my boyfriend to this very romantic, special restaurant and we had a great time
If you are looking for a break from the norm of 'trendy' overdone restaurants, look no further
This place is a gem!
Went there a few weeks ago around 8 on a Saturday night
The place was empty, which made us a bit wary, but we really enjoyed our meals
I had a huge tasty curry soba soup bowl, with chicken, for under $10
My boyfriend had a Salmon bento box, which had at least an 8 oz piece of salmon, and 2 tuna and 2 salmon sushi, which were fresh and generous sizes
He's got a healthy appetite, and he was full afterwards
Fave was the mochi with ice cream filling - green tea, mango, and red bean were the choices we enjoyed
No alcohol, just soda and tea, plus apps, and our bill was around $40
You can't beat that for a Saturday night!
I've been dining at El Charro for 16 years now, and altho they retain the fajitas and salsa and chips from its Mexican days %) YEARS AGO! the owners are Galician, and this place is authentically spanish! Try the Pollo Ajillo, the always perfect Calamares Fritos, or any of the nuerous fish and seafood dishes
Galicia is nome of the best seafood in Spain!
and you will not be disappointed
El Charro is kid-friendly, with a couple of menu choices even the pickiest children seem to love, and the Spanish wine list is reasonably priced and excellent
Always on my TOP FIVE list of where to eat in New York!
I have been coming to El Charro for 15 years and I have never had a bad meal
The chips that are on the table are homemade and delicious-order the guacamole as an addition, it's worth it
The Sangria is amazing, definitely get a pitcher
or two
I love the shrimp with green sauce, but nothing I have had has ever disappointed
Service is great and it's a very cute, romantic setting
I go to El Charro on a regular basis with my roommates
The service is the best I have experienced anywhere in the city
The waiters are friendly and attentive, always willing to go the extra mile
The sangria is sensational
order a pitcher because you won't be able to get enough - - if you call in advance they will soak the fruit for even longer
The portions are large, so I suggest sharing with friends
I always get the lobster tails - - they are cooked in the most amazing lime butter sauce I have ever tasted
Don't pass on dessert!
Please don't believe the category in which this restaurant is listed here
This is a Dominican restaurant! You will find the best churrasco IN ALL OF MANHATTAN AND ANYWHERE NEAR! I am not talking from my heart when I say this; there is nothing particularly special about this place, but the truth must be said
I have eaten churrascos in many places, big and small, and this is without a doubt the best I have ever had
I cannot comment on other dishes, but they certainly look good
The service is standard; don't expect to be received with a smile and professioanlism
just asked to be seated and ask for what you want
I also recommend the cortadito, a espresso with just enough steamed milk to cut the sourness of the coffee
Ah, El Paso Taqueria
That bastion of authentic Mexican food in Spanish Harlem that earned raves by white reviewers, leading other gringos to nervously venture to Spanish Harlem and pretend they're trendy to pay too much for food that is only marginally better than the place around the corner
But really, El Paso is the home to the $50 pitcher of margaritas
At least tonight
Maybe tomorrow it will be the $48 pitcher
Maybe the $60 pitcher
You see, when they cross out the price a few times on your bill and write new numbers, it's pretty clear they're making it up as they go along
Sure, you can try to dispute the bill, but even cries of locals are unsuccessful
Don't blame the waiter -- he didn't make up the price (allegedly) nor does he see the profit on what was $5 of tequila he sighs
Instead, just pay your bill, start a fight and storm out, vowing to return to order the reasonably priced appetizers that are a meal in themselves and to avoid the overpriced entrees that are a sure sign that this place has not only jumped the shark, but that it will charge you $50 for a small piece of that shark that would cost you $2 at the bodega across the street
I love this restaurant
I've been eating here for years
Try the Enchiladas Poblanas, they are delicious
Great place to watch the World Cup, too
I live around the corner from this place and this it is a great value for a great price
The food is authentic traditional mexican, and tastes great
The service is fast
The only this I don't like about this place is how tiny it is
Girls do not bring a large pocketbook if you are going to be dining here
This was a great place
true Mexican food in NYC
I had been longing for it since I left my home state of New Mexico
I not only enjoyed the affordable good food, but the atmosphere reminded me of home
I went there a few weeks ago and was sorely disappointed
The food was not as good (still more authentic than 95% of Mexican places in NYC), the menu had been revamped for non-native eaters and prices had gone up accordingly
The biggest disappointment
the atmosphere that reminded me of home no longer existed
The restaurant was filled with people who knew little or nothing aobut Mexican food - I heard many of them pestering the waitresses for mild dishes (why eat it if you don't really appreciate it's)
Luckily, I now know of other real Mexican places
that's where you'll find me eating nopalitos and drinking horchata
I live down the street, and I love coming here after work for the excellent tacos and a few cervezas
Last night, though, me and a friend were charged for ten beers when we only had six
We pointed it out, and the two waiters that had been serving us looked puzzled and made a big to-do of taking off the extra beers
Normally I'd chalk that up to an accident, but it was the fourth time something like that has happened to me at El Paso
Etou is a total gem! My reluctance stems from the fact that once everyone finds out how great it is I won't be able to get a table
The food is eye-poping, delicious, inventive and always very fresh
Sometimes the food takes awhile to come out, but when the masterpiece arrives you understand it's worth the wait
My biggest fear is that it will not be discovered soon enough and close
They also deliver and the food survives the trip pretty well
The front part is well-geared to families, while young lovers can neck in peace in the back
Just a few blocks north of Haru, the food is better, the service faster and much friendlier, the sushi more creative and cheaper -- this is the most underrated sushi restaurant around
The music could be picked up a bit, but this place overall is a 10!
This is hands down, the best sushi around

The service was terrible
The food took an hour to come and there were probably four tables with people
Blah experience
The Pink Pony's brunch is among the very best in the city! I love to go there on weekends and have the delicious french toast (made from baguette slices) or the granola with fresh fruit, sometimes I am so torn that I end up getting both! The cafe au lait is delicious and the atmosphere is so relaxed
The music is eclectic and ALWAYS GREAT, their juke box is filled with the best music of all genres! The Pink Pony is one of my favorite places to just sit back and hang out with friends, I hope it doesn't get overrun by people!
The food is decent but the crowd is screwy
I see the same people hanging out at this place everytime I walk by or go in
I think the Pink Pony has started some kind of Euro-trash cult
Don't these people have anything better to do in their free time than hang out at a French cafe? Maybe this is why I don't understand Europeans
I love this place
Relaxed and comfortable
I didn't realize how good the food was until I went for dinner the other night
We had the specials
Mine was sea bass with this olive paste sauce
Really good
The sauce in particular was really tasty
My friend had a sesame salmon that she really enjoyed
The details are charming and the staff is really nice
We also had a chocolate cake that was moist and rich
Loved it
fun place, reasonable wine list, good, friendly service
MISERABLE BEEF BOURGIGNON
actually, the food was not so impressive in general
the pate i had as an appetizer was pretty good, but it is not like they made it there
a nice place to go with friends
i've never had an unpleasant experience here
the service is friendly, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is comfortablenot self-conscious at all
it's one of those rare places where you can people watch for hours without being bothered
it also provides the pleasure of viewing the beautiful trendy LES crowd without the pressure of proving your own downtown credibility
the food is light healthythe turkey, cheese apple sandwich is perfect, so is the pateand you must try the tomato portabello mushroom soup if it's the special that night
order coffee after your meali think it's still only 99 cents, and it's great
plus, they serve Coke in the little green bottles
juke box: james brown, the zombies, nina simone, satie
very, very good pleasant stuff
While this place looked nice and cozy, our experience here was absolutely awful
Although almost the entire back room had tables available, the owner made people wait to be seated while dragging waitresses around by the arm and loudly telling them they were doing things wrong
He made waitresses re-seat people in the middle of their meals- they had to pick up everything and move a few seats down-- for no explicable reason! He insulted customers and yelled, telling them to stop arguing with him
although they were asking reasonable questions like how long will the wait be? and Could we sit down at one of those empty tables? We had reservations but still couldn't be seated, so we left
The waitresses were apologetic and embarrassed
I don't recommend this place unless you're in the mood for a little masochism- it's certainly run by a sadist
Poor staff
In Short Waitresses in shiny tan nylons and tight, orange, '70s track shorts serve up beer and pub grub at this proudly "tacky yet unrefined" sports bar-restaurant
Tables are packed with men of all ages, from high-powered suits to college guys in baseball caps
While salads, sandwiches and shellfish are on the menu, most folks order chicken wings--available in six levels of spice intensity, from mild to super-hot 911
The worst women that I have seen in any hooters nationwide, miserable and none too pretty either
it should not be over 100 degrees either!
The buffalo chicken tenders are the best! And the cesear salad is not bad
the food is ok and the legs are awesome!!!!!!!! a good place to hang out and watch a game
Nothing beats being served platters of shrimp and wings and pitchers of beer, by the HOTTEST waitstaff in NY!!!! Great prices for so much eye candy!!!
Go figure, my girlfriend likes this place, I don't (hmm
)
The wings aren't buffalo style like I hoped: they're breaded and deep-fried, then put in a sticky, yucky tobasco-y sauce
Yes, hard not to look at the waitresses (and they're really good servers), but as I'm reminded by everyone who knows Hooters, they don't rank anywhere near the girls at the Hooters locations South of the ol' Mason-Dixon
I'm still searching the menu for something I like
At least there are many TVs for sports, that's the only reason I allow people to take me there anymore
The Scene In the warm months, Cafe St
Bart's occupies the capacious tiled terrace of Saint Bartholomew's Church
The handsome church looms to one side, the Waldorf-Astoria is across the street, and midtown's soaring office towers are visible in every direction
The crowd is a mixture of tourist families from nearby hotels and professionals enjoying the air
The Food The menu is solidly Californian with touches of Mexican and Southern flair
Standout entrees include grilled baby lamb chops in a piquant minty sauce or batter-fried okra with a spicy dip
The notable array of refreshing drinks includes raspberry lemonade, an assortment of smoothies and iced teas, and a black cow ice-cream float
Cafe St
Bart's has wonderful outdoor seating
I was there on a Friday night and a band played while we dined
The food by New York standards is fine but nothing more
I can think of many other restaurants that have better food
Cafe St Bart's main draw is the outdoor seating
If not for the great outdoor space, I would say to pass
It is by no means a cheap restaurant and for the money you could get a better meal elsewhere
So if you really just want to wine and dine outside the place is a good spot
Also note, they only serve beer and wine
I ate here last week and loved it! The ambiance IS amazing--a truly lovely only-in-New-York space
And the food was delish
I had the shrimp appetizer--spicy sauce was great and the breading was light/perfect
But the best thing of the night was the steak
Forget what it was called, but it had some kind of onion puree on top that ROCKED and the steak was a grass-fed organic type and very tender
Perfectly cooked, too: crispy outside, pink inside
And it came with blue-cheese mashed potatoes
YUMMMMMM
This was my frist time at Cafe St
Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was
When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips
I highly recommend Cafe St
Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service
I tried to make a reservation and was treated horribly by the receptionist(s)
Although the first person with whom I spoke took my reservation down, when I called back to confirm, my reservation had been lost
I would have taken this news reasonably, but I was promptly scolded for even thinking that I could get into this restaurant on less than a week's notice
The owner repeatedly interrupted me as I simply tried to ask a question about timing (to see if I might be able to re-schedule)
Honestly, given the reviews that I had read about the subpar food at Cafe St Bart's, I was only planning on going for the outdoor ambience
But with the horrible service I experienced, I won't make that same mistake again
With so many great options for food in midtown, don't waste your time on a restaurant that can't find time for you
9
5? What for? For Park avenue I expected so much more
The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about
Definitely Highly NOT recommended
Had brunch with 3 friends here

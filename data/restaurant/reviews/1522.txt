I had Jambalaya for $20 which in hindsight would have been $20 that I should have just ripped to shreds and saved myself the trauma
Total bill was $54 for 2 and that was a smack in the face
Bad enough to make me want to come here and write about it
just hanging out with friends and it's so familiar, every one there is friendly ! come all
2nd Avenue Deli has nothing on Goodman's
The best pastrami in the NY area
This restaurant specializes in Pakistani cusine
The best food I enjoyed here include: - Beef Keema Naan [Highly Recomended] - Nihari - Naan with sesame seed - Koftas - Seikh Kababs - Chana - Halva Puri - Paya  You can easily make this your regular eat-out place, because of low rates and high quality
Service sometimes takes longer, but its worth the wait
I love the eating at Ibby's
I first tried it last week, and has been going there since, every other day (I guess it helps that I live in the area)
I've heard the buzz abt this place for a while, but was always skeptical
You've got to try the Shawarma! pair it off with Tea and a Baklava for a fulfilling meal
I also like the Falafel and chicken kebab
You really can't go wrong in this place
The ambiance is nice, the ppl are friendly, you can sit outside when the weather's nice
The food price is very reasonable
Ever since I moved to Jersey City I've been looking for the food the I usually enjoyed at home
My friend recommended this place called Ibby's
At first I was doubtful that I would be as good as my mom's
Promise not to tell but boy I was wrong
The tahini sauce was just like the one my mom used to make at home
The falafel was ten times better
But my favorite has to be the chicken kebab with a little bit of there hot sauce! And of course you can't forget the desserts, the bakalava is so sweet, and the nemoura forget about it , it's out of this world! I suggest you go to Ibby's and treat yourself to the good life! THANKS IBBY'S!
Have been going to Komegashi for over 10 yrs, the sushi is excellent and so are the people!
When looking for a contemporary Japanese restaurant, I found a real good one to my satisfaction!
I had a tremendous dining experience at the Flamingo
The food was great and the staff was exceptionally friendly
I would recommend this place to anyone
I was brought to this wonderful little restaurant by a couple of good friends, and that's when I was introduced to one of the best local restaurants in Jersey City
I was hooked to their three different kinds of croquettas immediately
There are ham, chicken, fish, and spinach kinds, and they are all good
For entree their beef cubes are fantastic, as well as their fish
Oh yeah, it's a BYOB place
So, come and bring your favorite wine
I live in Manhattan, and my friends no longer live in Jersey City---but I've since come back for more croquettas
I had to send back my iced coffee twice to get some ice in my glass, but my Aztec omelette was excellent
Towards the end of our meal, a server came out, apparently our orders had been double-filled
I really do hope they work out their service problems, because the food is excellent, but the staff have no idea what they're doing
I went here on a cold rainy night when I was craving mom's rice and beans
The food here fit the bill and more: I ended up eating so much that my stomach hurt! Definitely try the pernil platter and the batidos (milk shakes)
The food was perfectly seasoned and the beans made me want to cry for joy
There is a good mixed crowd and nice decor to boot
Who would have thought this cozy, low key restaurant turned out to be one of the best Italian food I ever tasted!!! It was my first time there and I had the Veal and it was fantastic
The complimentary salad is awesome and the potatoes and veggies are excellent
I would come back to eat again
No matter what you order from the menu is excellent
The only thing that I would not recommend to people is getting pasta on the side with their dinner as the sauce is not that good which is suprising for an eatery with such delicious food
Get the potato and vegetable's on the side, which is much better
Appetizer, dinner, a small carafe of house wine, desert and coffee will only run you about $80
00 with tip
Portions are generous, they serve you a wonderful house salad at no charge, and their bread is excellent
Since it's a small place, it's best to get there early for dinner as the wait can be quite long if you don't make a reservation
Having just moved here from a friendlier place and time--let's call it Texas--, I found this place to be just GREAT!  I visited because of a recommendation
returned because of the food and service
and became a regular because it just starts to feel like family!  Everyone is really friendly
The food is delicious and the portions are huge! Prices are very reasonable
The small dining area has a warm, cozy, at-home feel
(They have a larger room for parties
) The place is conveniently located, but hard to find the first time (that circle on 1-9 is kinda confusing), but once you've been there, it's easy to get there
They have a TINY parking lot that's hard to get out of
Park on the street, or in the bigger parking lot across the street
Unassuming storefront, simple interior with the ubiquitous 'Gyro Girl' posters--don't be fooled! Larry Joe's can boast some of the best greasy thin-crust pizza around
Their other dishes are also great--the subs, the lasagna, and the gyros are standouts
How good? All the local cops seem to eat there
Cheap too!
they prepare the best Italian cuisine in all of the tri state area
eat there atleast once a week
food is great with a great price
have never been disappointed
On a recent visit to the River Palm Terrace in Fair Lawn, we ordered the porterhouse steak, for two
When it arrived, we were surprised to find that they had had served us a T-bone steak with a separate piece of fillet mignon on the side
The difference between a T-bone and porterhouse cut is in the amount of the filet mignon (tenderloin) side of the bone
When I complained about this to the manager, she curtly replied that I was wrong
She further stated that all restaurants do this and that we should be pleased that they included the extra piece of fillet mignon
They will not have another opportunity to pawn off a T-bone cut as a porterhouse at our expense as we will never return to this restaurant
I was introduced to Good Times from my cousin, thought it was a diner
Actually it is better than a diner
This place is beautiful and classy! I love the shiny metal ribbon that wraps around the exterior of the restaurant
The one of the managers I met, Cindy, she made me felt right at home
She has a bubbly personality and shes also humorous! The food is great there, very tasty
If you go there, you MUST try their Tiramisu
My goodness, it is so good that you would want seconds! The bathroom at Good Times was clean and the sink is hot! If you need to freshen up, there are amenities for you to use
So you will always look great before or after your meal
I must say, as a picky eater and diner, Good Times is where you can relax and have a good time!
A little hard to find but worth the effort - great food
Best pizza around
Neapolitan style thin crust but strong enough to handle all sorts of toppings and extremely tasty!
In Short Festive decor of colorfully tiled tables, vintage photographs and sunny Southwestern accents welcomes an all-ages crowd at this informal hangout
Youngsters and their parents pile into dining room booths; casual business types toss back margaritas and watch televised sports at the bar
The menu features mild versions of Lone Star state favorites, from double-basted baby back ribs and steak fajitas to red-beef chili and deep-fried onions
Nice place to go when you are at work on a Friday afternoon, and want to go out for lunch
I just like the Chicken Cripsers! I know they are no good for my heart, but once a month or so, won't kill me
I hope (lol)
Try the El Presidente Margarita, you will only need one if you have to go back to work, but maybe two of them other times
Provided there is a designated driver
This place is outstanding - the young and personable chef/owner has a deft hand at just about anything that he puts out
The homemade raviolis are my favorite, and the braised meats, risottos, and polenta preparations are second to none
Great Food, but BAD area
Make sure you get your Order to TAKE OUT and get to your Car and drive someplace else that is safe to eat it

The bruchetta's thick and crusty country bread readily soaks up the juices from its ripe tomato topping
Rigatoni pasta with slow-cooked ragu is served perfectly al dente, and shares a light, sauteed onion sauce with pillowy Parmesan gnocchi
Uncle Michael's tasty and heavy-as-gravy red sauce coats the polpetonne's giant meatball of spicy meat loaf
Feathery whipped cream saves the unsweetened apple tart, but goes best inside a delicious tiramisu
been going here for 5 yrs
my favorite italian restaurant in the city
pasta is always very good, especially the black spaghetti
ambience is great; elbow to elbow, like being in europe
it's a long wait but the waitstaff has always been friendly
can't find this kind of joint for a good price in nyc
I went at 6PM with only 1 other person both times I've eaten at Frank's, which seems to be a good trick - I had none of the problems with waiting, rushing, or poor service that others have reported
The service was friendly, patient, and helpful
The waiter even gave me a taste of wine to sample
My favorites are the mussels and the fish soup
They serve a perfect rustic bread for soaking everything up
Frank's is a great treat - excellent prices, good value
Check their website to see the daily specials first - the regular menu is a little limited, though I hear the salmon is excellent
I was only a little disappointed in a pasta with baby clams - just not enough seafood for the price
But besides that, I look forward to sampling more of what Frank's has to offer - in the early evenings
We had a party for 12 a few weeks ago and we waited an hour and 15 minutes for our reserved table
Then we were told every five minutes that the table was almost ready and to go get drinks atthe bar next door
Food was good, but not worth the wait
Extremely poor service, waitress walked in on me inthe bathroom, because that's how they get from the basement to their kitchen
You be better served going to the Olive Garden in Times Square
Don't say I didn't warn you if you decide to go with a large group of 3 or more
If it's just 2 people, maybe a mere 30 minute wait is possible
I don't want to give the impression that this is a busy place, but that they don't have enough room to accommodate more than 40 people at time
A month ago I ate here for the 1st time, thought it was good basic food at a great price
I brought my bf last night and was so disappointed!  our food never came at the same time
i got my appetizer
5 mins later he got his
as if to even things out, he got his entree 5 mins before mine
i ordered pear and gorgonzola salad
i received a dormroom presentation of sliced and peeled pear circling a chunk of gorgonzola
my entree chicken was dry n'salty, the mashed potatoes chalky
his pasta was worse
I'd said that the meatballs were delicious last time; he ordered rigatoni
based on flavour, the sauce was poured out of a large red can marked heinz
this may explain the complete lack of wait for a table
maybe it was just an off night, but I won't be back to find out
I'm still recovering from lack of circulation
The space is so redicuously overcrowded! Do not go in parties larger than two!!! Food was excellent, but if you have a larger party prepare to sit on laps
I've been going back to Frank because I enjoy the food and while the service has never been exceptional it hasn't been bad either
until my last visit
I went with a group of friends we made reservations and were seated promptly upon arriving at 7:30pm
Once seated our waiter informed us that he needed us out by 9:30?!? Just a little rude
Rushed is an understatement, we ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees and were out of there before 8:30
Because there were 8 of us the 20% tip was included in the bill - unfortunately the service we received did not deserve such a tip
I will miss the food, but with all the great restaurants in NYC I will NEVER go to Frank again!
Frank is one of the only restuarants that reminds me of my 1 year stay in Italy
The food is not fussed over, just simply good rustic Italian
I highly recommend the polpette (big meatball with potato and parmagian gratin) Although it is hard to get a table especially on a weekend night, there is a comunal table which always proves to be a good time
The service isn't great, but the food is worth waiting for!
I've been a customer of this restaurant since it opened
Yes, you have to be patient to get a table and with the service at times, but I have to admit, it takes even greater patience to work here
NY restaurant go-ers, esp
those with a date can be the rudest people on earth
So, some people don't like it here, fine - go back to your what's in magazines and choose another destination
Leave this place for people who are at home here and don't need need to be seen at the latest hot spot
We'll keep coming back!
I am Italian
Its refreshing to find a real italian trattoria in NYC
Here I feel welcome and at home
Trattorie in Italy are informal and casual neiborhood places to eat
They are not about annoying service, they are about warmth and authenticity
Frank is all of these things and more!! I am surprised no one here mentions a wine list that rivals some of the best list in Italy
Its incredible to find $10 pasta along side rare Barolos, Barbarescos, and Brunellos
I am so impressed to find a place like this in a money oriented souless place like NY
this place could charge three times what they do but they don't
Thanks for one of the best meals i have had in NYC
A friend and I sat at the bar on a recent Friday night
The bartender disappeared every five minutes to smoke cigarettes with nearly every female in the establishment
He spent more time standing around outside than he did behind the bar
Not once, but twice, did the host have to call him back inside
It's fine if you want to pick up girls, but please do that on your own time
We got so fed up waiting around, we left
Judging from the other recent reviews written on here, bad service seems to be the norm at Frank's
The value is good for the food but all i have to say is that it is NOT WORTH THE 1 1/2 HR WAIT at a TINY, LOUD, CROWDED WANNABE-HIP HOLE with a SNOBBY RUDE MAITRE'D who holds dearly onto his clipboard acts as if it were the waitlist into heaven
more like HELL! We ended up going to underrated Italian place next door which had great service and good food
Problem at this ecletic little place is that it is an insiders hang out and you cant get a table if you are not in an acting class with a waiter
Food is OK, and scene is great, but please find a way to service new customers
They dont need new customers
Always crowded
The food is pretty good
Not great, but pretty good
It's a shame that this place has probably the worst service that I've ever encountered
And you have to wait over an hour for a table -- if you're not pals with the staff, that is
But with friends like those who needs enemies? Seriously, the service is so bad and the attitude so offensive that the good food is just not worth it -- it's not like you can't get food just as good at many other restaurants
I'll never be responsible for contributing another dime to this place
The staff is disrespectful and rude because this restaurant is always crowded
This is very shortsighted, as most places in New York don't stay crowded for very long
I won't ever be a part of that crowd again, and neither should you
You deserve better
the famous food is delicious, but not worth the rude, disorganized staff
My friends and I waited an hour and a half when quoted 30 minutes, asked for water twice to two seperate people and never received it, were served out entrees before we could even begin our appetizer
The entrees were also delivered one by one with a span of 3-5 minutes in between each delivery
Once we reached the halfway point of our dinner, the check was dropped off as if to move us along
This is the worst nyc dining experience I've ever had! The bartender has a nasty attitude, and it took a party of two 1 1/2 hours to get seated while party after party of the hosts 'friends' were given seating immediately
The pasta was undercooked, bland, and somehow the salad my friend ordered as an entree didn't arrive until 10 minutes and several complaints to the waitstaff after the UNDERCOOKED PASTA DISH
When I told the waiter the food was okay, he corrected me and told me it was the best in the city

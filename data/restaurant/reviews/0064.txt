) Not only do they do the shabu write with good ingredients, the sauces are both great, i recommend sesame for the meats and the other one for vegetables
The appetizers are also great; i love their original chicken tofu gyoza and their bibimbaps have great flavor
I'm having my birthday there this year because I know nothing beats the great-tasting food! The set menu also comes with the best green tea icecream
I recommend going before seven to beat crowds
This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area
I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan
Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu
Always popular, always full, always a wait
I love the place
Just wish they'd expand
I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more! There is usually a wait but it is well worth it
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh
The fried rice is really good too
The staff is also attentive and friendly
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time
Great service, great food
Prices are in line
Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down
But too far east!
Shabu Tatsu serves 'shabu-shabu,' the style of Japanese tableside cooking named for the gentle sound of boiling broth
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles
Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks, swirl them around, and eat
At the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup
It can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it
Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods
The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy
Satisfying
I am Japanese-American, so I would like to think that I know a thing or two about authentic Japanese cuisine (and Hot Dogs too)
Takino is a bit pricey, but the food is just as it should be
Tasty, delicate and prepared with great care
The sushi is finely made with care and NOT rushed- so expect to take your time or go somewhere else
The entree menu is not diverse, but the items on it are all very good
There are others around which cost less, but splurge and enjoy your meal
I've been going to Tapas Lounge for a few years, and I absolutely love it!!!! The sangria is incredible, and the tapas have always been consistently delicious
The decor is beautiful and romantic
And, unlike most loud, crowded tapas places, there's enough room to sit back and enjoy the environment (while still being able to hold a conversation)
Similar to other reviews that Ive read, I wish that I wouldve visited your site prior to going to this restaurant
In any case it has urged me to join Citisearch and write my thoughts about this place that is truly disgraceful for what a tapas bar experience should beFirst of all the menu leaves a lot to be desired, it is very limited and not quite representative of a tapas restaurant
The raw materials were definitely on the cheap side, the chorizo was so blah and the paella was completely tasteless, clearly made from a frozen one
To make matters worse, the smell in my clothes from the poor ventilation has remained in my clothes for days
Service was ok, price was not
Bottom line: Avoid the joint!
Having read several bad reviews, I was in no rush to go to Tapas Lounge but when a former NY friend was visiting from LA said we had to go, I went
Wow! What a waste of a night
The sangria was good but no where good enough to rationalize the $45 it cost
The tapas were good but the sizes were beyond small
Three shrimp for $10?!? No wonder why there is a two tapas minimum per person
As nice as the ambience was, this is one place I will not be going back to
I can't believe people go to this place
The size of the dishes is tiny, the drinks are all over priced, and they push bottled wine on you over and over again! Who wants wine with their finger food? Not me, and I will never go back there again! The place was jammed, and the boy who was apparently the manager seemed to not care about his over worked servers
I've lived in Spain for a year and traveled widely across Zaragoza, Leon, Cuenca, Barcelona, and Madrid
Tapas are normally small and unless you can afford to buy 5 or 6 tapas in the $8-14 range (each) accompanied by a good bottle of Rioja wine, you should opt for more americanized environments such as Xunta or Rincon de Espana
A larger portion is a racion
The Spanish Moorish architecture and external ironwork are unique
The dim lighting, couches, and soft Medditerranean sounds in the background are the major draw
It's a great place to bring a colleague for drinks, a group of friends with eclectic tastes, or a special friend you want to relax with
I suggest you order the Patatas Bravas (spicy fries), the mussels, the jamon serrano, and el pollo andaluz
Yes, it's expensive and the waitstaff is not Spanish
however, the experience is anything but ordinary
I have never had such bad service at a restaurant
**** I HAVE HAD BETTER SERVICE AT MCDONALD'S
****  The food - mediocre, at best
Small portions; overpriced
I will never EVER go back to this restaurant, and I will certainly discourage those that I know from going and wasting their time and money
The host was rude, ushering my party to the bar
We stood there with our coats in hand, wondering why no one offered to check them
Our server didn't care in the least as to how our experience was
We seemed to be no more than a nuisance to him
And a minimum of two tapas (dishes) per person? Please, how classless
I won't go on
I'll just say that it was BAD, BAD, BAD
Don't go - it's such a waste
Had dinner there last night and got TOTALLY SCREWED!!! Small, WAY OVERPRICED tapas and a small, sub-par paella
I lived in Madrid for a year and was appalled at my treatment
Manager an arrogant jerk
$15 for tiny Kir Royale, and $10 for a glass of table wine? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!
Good for an after work date
The only thing they require is to buy two dishes per person
Each cost around $8 so that makes it $32 and not including drinks! Small decent portions though
Try their spiked lemonade - delicious
Oh, and no tables, all are coffee table height so put the hanky on the lap
WARNING: THE SERVICE IS ATROCIOUS AND THE FOOD/DRINK IS ABSURDLY OVERPRICED
Run, don't walk, away from this mediocre restaurant
After spending $250 for a few tasteless tapas and subpar sangria ($40 a pitcher!), our party of four was promptly asked by our waitress--not more than 1
5 minutes after we paid the bill--to relocate to the bar because another party was waiting for our table
Instead of letting us finish our 1/2 glass of sour sangria, we were urged two or three more times to leave
A cocky, arrogant and shockingly condescending manager (all of 22 years-old) then told us we should leave the restaurant if we wouldn't move to the bar
Let me add that there were other available tables
In sum, the service is horrific and the food is bland--very disappointing for a place that looks laid back and inviting on the surface
Each time I'm in the city, I try to get to the Tapas Lounge for dinner
This time I took my father and it was still the best tapas around, as far as I'm concerned
(The romanesco sauce for the fried calamari is to die for!)
Wonderful romantic ambiance and a satisfying meal at a reasonable price
The service is a little slow, but I doubt I'd have noticed if I'd been there with my boyfriend and not my father (my dad's comment - it's a make out restaurant with all the low seats and dark lighting)
My only caution - don't pay for a hookah here, nowhere near as good as Sahara East
Also - you really should make a reservation, regardless of whether they will be busy
They seat you faster that way
The Tapas lounge offers a nice romantic ambience
It's dim, with medieval, dungeon-like decor and cushy couches surrounding glass coffee tables
It's a great place to sip sangria by candle light

The ribs were top notch and the portions were perfect
A lesser priced luncheon meal was the same size as a regular meal anywhere else
The total cost was delightfully inexpensive and the service was efficient and cordial
Ask for Andrew M
if you want a good lunch experience, he certianly did it for me
If you want to go to a fun place where eating and drinking won't cost you a week's paychek, then this is the place for you
Great for hanging out with friends, a night out to dinner with your mate, or even by yourself would be just as good
The drinks aren't watered down, the food is always hot and good to eat, and the atmosphere is truly a NY experience all the way around
Just make sure you have some time on your hands because it stays crowded and the waitors and waitresses are always EXTREEMELY busy!
Love the chicken and ribs combo
Its my favorite
The fish platter isn't bad at all
Shrimp are a little salty
I plan to try the new coconut shrimp next time
(23rd Street location)
Hopefully all BBQ's offer the FROZEN APPLE MARTINI
Its to die for!
From the Texas size Margaritas to the dinner selections, Dallas BBQ is about value
Sure, it's rather noisy, and you will most likely have to wait a bit to get a seat, but when it comes to value, Dalls BBQ can't be beat
One of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head: it's the margaritas that make this place great
The food itself is so-so, but I've had one or two summer evenings sitting outside sipping their alcoholic lovelies that I wouldn't trade for anything
I went to the location on 2nd ave by St
Marks Place
The food was very bad and the service was bad! They have these things called Sticky Wings, they are huge chicken wings about the size of your hand or bigger
They are 98% bones and skin with only a tiny hint of meat and the honey sauce was just honey poured all over them
Disgusting! The ribs were below diner grade, you can get better at just about any NYC diner
The service was pretty bad
She came by the table once and disappeared
I had to get up to look for her to PAY the check! If I had to stand around any longer to pay I was going to walk out! What a waste of time and money!
I like Dallas BBQ's at the Times Square location the best
The food is good
It is inexpensively priced
The wings are unbelievable
Try both hot wings and esp
try the honey wings
The alcoholic drinks are brought to you with a fantastically nice presentation!!! Nice spot for a group of friends to hang out
Good for a family sitting too
Definitely an after work spot
There's nothing exceptional about any of the food in this Texas-size feeding trough, but it's all tasty and it's all reasonably priced
Plus the Texas-sized alcoholic drinks wash it all down with a nice buzz
Best BBQ in town for a cheap price
And the oversized texas size drinks get you a nice buzz for under $7
00
Now it recently expanded menu there is no need to be limited to chicken, ribs, and burgers as in the past
Now you can even have steak, a variety of salads and fish and shrimp
And yes the combos you can have your ole favorites along with one the new additions
The Early Bird Special is super--you get 2 meals for a great price
The Onion Loaf is truly fantastic, very tasty
The fruity Texas size margharitas are fabulous
Be warned--the food is GREASY, but it's what you expect at a BBQ joint
They do pack you in next to other patrons, which is annoying
It's sort of an NYC institution
None of them are attractive in anyway, and the food is certainly not good for you
But you get good grease food for cheap,a dn they have great BIG drinks, it will always do in a pinch
Try the pina colada with a shot of Barcardi 151
The Scene Since 1990, this over-the-top Italianate dining room, with lavish floral arrangements, classical moldings and long white tablecloths, has made uptowners and expense-accounters feel right at home
Now, a long antipasto table--positioned along the heavily trafficked entrance--entices with cheese and roasted vegetable displays, and there's a fresh coat of paint on the walls
The details, however, aren't all four-star: Wine glasses are clunky and service can be rushed and rote
The Food Chef Mark Strausman's lengthy menu is full of Tuscan favorites, but it's best to stick with simple dishes like spaghetti with well-seasoned meatballs and the beautifully marbled, rosemary-rubbed Tagliata steak
Some dishes show carelessness, such as overcooked polenta in the osso buco and under-seasoned ravioli filled with carrot
Sadly, changed over the summer time to something dry, cold emtpy restautant
Quite surprized that lunches are no more available here
Service needs to be brought on the same level as it used to be
That is the best way to describe it
delicious and great service!
Quietly classy gourmet experience, excellent Italian food
Two people visiting from Italy were in our party, and even they had only good things to say about this restaurant
This was my second time to dine at Coco Pazzo and the consistancy was impressive
The food, as with my first experience, was very tasty and satisfied my hunger
The Scene You could be at a brasserie on Paris' Left Bank, for the setting has all the accouterments of the real thing: oversized mirrors, ornate chandeliers, brass railings and roomy banquettes
Contributing to the romantic scene are discreet servers, who know when less is better
Because of its slightly out-of-the-way location, it draws an older crowd
The Food Chef-owner Jean-Michel Bergougnoux, formerly of Lutece, melds the best of classic cuisine with modern accents--some of them surprising
Luscious seared fois gras arrives with a corn crepe and sweet rhubarb confit, while tender pork tenderloin gets a textural boost from roasted macadamia nuts and porcini mushrooms
You won't find a better choucroute garni in town--sauerkraut, potatoes and assorted sausages--and the thin-crusted apple tart alone is worth the trip
I went here for my birthday a while back and I LOVED every minute of it
The staff was amazing, took pictures for me, surprised me with a birthday cake etc
Our waiter was hysterically funny and attentive to our needs
The food was yummy, cocktails was amazing, desert was delicious
Kind of pricy but - it was my birthday
We had a birthday group dinner there
Menu selections were limited
Food tasted like any other food, nothing special
Didn't even taste French
The duck and lamb chops were okay but then again, how can they mess up grilled meat? We brought our own cake and they charged 6-dollars per person for plating
We dined at L'Absinthe on January 7th and found the restaurant to be first class in every way
We were promptly seated at our reservation time at a romantic corner banquette although the restaurant was very busy
price
We enjoyed a special delicate asparagus soup and a lobster salad with shaved black truffle, celery root and diced green beans
For our entrees we selected traditional brasserie plates of coq au vin, steeped in a delicious red wine, and steak frites
The strip steak was exceptional and the potatoes were light and crisp
The bernaise sauce added to the flavor of the dish

The patrons are generally older and very well dressed, this being the Upper East Side
The ambiance and decor are of 1890's Paris, the Belle Epoch era, and are quite charming
We will certainly return as there are many more offerings we wish to try
MY WIFE AND I JUST CELEBRATED OUR 5TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY AT L'ABSINTHE
WALKING THROUGH THE DOOR WAS LIKE LEAVING NEW YORK BEHIND AND ENTERING AN EXQUISTE RESTAURANT IN THE MIDDLE OF PARIS
WE COULD NOT HAVE SELECTED A BETTER RESTAURANT FOR OUR ROMANTIC DINNER
THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, BEING PROMPT AND ATTENTIVE

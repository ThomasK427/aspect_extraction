They must not be used to large parties, even though we tried to make reservations ahead of time
Also we called ahead to get the OK if to bring in a cake from the outside
We were told there was no charge, yet they charged $1 per slice that night! The prices aren't too pretty, though reasonable for the area
Maybe ODM is more pleasant friendly on a weeknight with just a few people, but please don't try to bring in a large party on a weekend!
The best thing about ODM is its vast selection--vegetarians and meatatarians eat side by side without issue
The funky decor is pleasing, too
When it first opened, this was a favorite
Tasty Southern cooking at inexpensive prices
It's stayed farly cheap, but the food quality has declined
Everything is overcooked and tastes the same
Service is molasses-like
Great jukebox and beer list, though
The Scene The trio of owners behind club Opaline struck this Alphabet City success with funky bistro-style restaurant
Named for the vintage Bakelite receivers displayed throughout the dining room, Radio Perfecto has the sleek appeal of a diner
Wacky design touches--like sconces fashioned from antique flashlights and power drills--and a year-round garden add to the laid-back ambience
The Food The relatively inexpensive menu consists of dressed-up staples such as spit-roasted duck with Bing cherry sauce, house-baked empanadas and rotisserie chicken with hand-cut Belgian fries
The less adventurous can find comfort in juicy burgers, buffalo wings and chicken burritos
The food here is consistently good - the service is not - but it seems that they're getting busier than they can handle, good for them, bad for guests
My advice is to go before 8:00pm to get consistently good food and service
Went to brunch on a Sunday at 1pm
They were out of spinich for their spinich omlette, we waited for a long time for our food and when it came it was the wrong thing
The food was nothing special - fries were out of the freezer (not homemade) and eggs were average
Waitress was very nice but not impressive
The food was good
The $2
00 appetizers and drinks from 6pm-8pm is definitely a great value
The service was great and the atmosphere was pretty good
The service was fabulous!
My friend suggested Radio Perfecto to me, since I'm new in the neighborhood
It was a totally chill, fun place to hang out which had surprisingly good food
I was expecting an average meal and was really pleased to get an awesome dinner - and it was pretty cheap too
I'm definitely coming back - especially when it's warm enough to sit in the garden!
I always enjoy my trips to Radio
Whether I'm on a date or having a party with friends, the food, service and atmosphere are always great
Perfect place to have a great inexpensive meal and then stick around and down a few cocktails
I highly recommend it, and your wallet will too
this past sunday i wanted to take my out of town guest to a hip avenue b brunch spot
all the usual suspects were overcrowded with long waits
radio perfecto however, had loads of tables available
being hungry, we decided to try it
what a mistake
the french toast was burnt, the pancakes cold, and the service atrocious
next time, i'll wait for quality
They only give you 2 empandas for $ 6
95 - doesn't seem right
The Argula-portabella mushroom salad was great!  The Philly cheese steak was average and the hamburger was over cooked
The skinny french fries are pretty good
i had dinner at radio perfecto on a rainy Friday evening before checking out the Nuyorican Poets Cafe a few blocks away
what a cool vibe! vintage radios decorated the walls and they had some funky blue chairs from the 70s (designed by Eames?)
the roast chicken special was fantastic and i love the world music they played
all together a cool vibe! will go again when i just want to chill
if u eat late it does get a bit loud so go early if you can
:)
I had a great time two weeks ago, really didn't know what to expect
I heard so much about the place thought I would give it a try
The food was really good at an amazing price
Very Funky decor but not to bouzchie more authentic artsy east village, and decent service to match
Hmmmm, sounds simple to me
Don't see why a lot of these people get so worked up when your paying so little anyway?
Everyone just needs to chill out
the food is good, and if you're one of the few people who actually takes the time to not ignore your server, the guys and gals here are actually pretty witty and fun
They're easy on the eyes too
It's not as chic as some, but it doesn't cost as much either
If this is your first time in the East Village, it pretty much sums up the experience
take that however you choose to
The burgers are underrated
I went in to Radio Perfecto to check out their Phat Tuesday deal that I saw in Jest magazine
It was great! So much food and beer for such a great price, not to mention a very relaxed, loungey atmosphere
The place is cool, the staff was great, the food delicious
I will be back soon
I just had a really good time at Radio Perfecto on Avenue B
I'd never been there before, but everything was so good, I wonder why not
The food was good and cheap, our waitress was adorable and the atmosphere was really fun
I'm definitey going back
Food was not very good and took a long time to come
Service was weird and slow
All in All it was expensive for what it was, and there's lots of other choices in the neighborhood
Quite and cozy
Cute little restaurant tucked away in the east village amongst stylish vintage clothing stores, neighborhood Iglesias and your everyday ordinary people
Good food
Penne and Vodka was great!
but the food and service are atrocious
It's too bad that a place supposidly known for it's chicken can be upstaged by Boston Chicken or Popeys
Maybe if the staff was a little more attentive and friendly it would have made up for the sub-par food
However, this was not the case
Never again
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, and more wonderful
great live music, delicious booze, and the damn sexiest bartenders in town
The best comfort food ever
If you have never tried it, take the time and visit
the ambiance is serene and smooth, the food is delicious, and the price is right!
What a fun little step back to the 50's
AMAZING wings and desserts in addition to a fun and comfy menu
A place you should make you business to check out!
HAD DINNER THE OTHER NIGHT WITH A FEW FRIENDS FROM OUT OF TOWN, WHAT A DELIGHT
RADIO HAS ADDED A MARTINI MENU WHICH IS FABULOUS WITH MANY TASTY OFFERS, LIKE THEIR APPLE MARTINI , AND THEIR CHICKEN WITH PESTO DIPPING SAUCE WAS FANTASTIC
THE SERVICE WAS ALSO QUITE NICE, ALWAYS GREETED WITH A SMILE
GREAT PLACE TO BRING OUTTA TOWNERS TO GET A TASTE OF WARM, FRIENDLY , NEIGHBORHOOD AMBIANCE
It's worth a trip to to the village from Brooklyn to have a great brunch
I was not disappointed

That being said, I've gone here over 10 times, service is always above excellent and the food is delicious and the chocolate souffle is crispy on the outside and melty goo on the inside
It's a dream
Ambiance - it's sometimes a little bright - but the service and food make up for it
Roy's is a really good restaurant in a neighborhood with few good places to go
The service is always impeccable
The waitstaff has a genuine friendliness that creates such a great environment dining here
We've been to the one in Honolulu and the New York restaurant doesn't compare to the one in Hawaii but it is still a good restaurant
The ribs entree is great
The cocktails are unique and really strong
The chocalate souffle is average
Dined at the New York location of Roy's this last Friday and came away a bit disappointed
We had been looking forward to eating here because we are quite familiar with the flagship location of Roy's in Honolulu
There were many good points to be made, including the great service (thanks Carla) and the wonderful cocktails (I highly recommed the Mango Martini and the Roy's Aloha), but the food overall was mediocre
The appetizers were the exception
We really enjoyed the bbq ribs especially! Perhaps those who have never dined at Roy's Hawaiian locations wouldn't feel let down, but unfortunately we were
Roy's was fantastic every time I went
The appetizers are amazing especially the spring rolls
I have tried different entres and they have all benn good with strong seasoning but not overdone
The spicy fusion flavors of Roys is not for those with a meek palate
Roy's is one of the few restarant capable of rendering fusion cusine that works
After reading a few other reviews and based on my own, long experience with Roy's, I wish Citysearch would ask someone else to do their editorial review
Daniel Rosenblatt got it all wrong!!!! The food at Roy's is not only adventurous in spirit but sublime in taste
And this is not your typical, haughty, 'tude-with-taste NYC establishment
Roy's service outshines that of five-star places
They really do treat the diner like gold
A wonderful place where you get what you pay for!!!!
We went Friday night, even though it was storming, and had an amazing experience
The big eye tuna tempura was phenomenal and the macadamia crusted mahi mahi was delicious
The drink menu was almost extensive as the drink menu
Our waitress, Stacy, was friendly and very knowledgable of the menu and wine list
I can't wait to return!
That's what the hosts greet you with
Everyone was extremely helpful
The food was absolutely delicious with bold flavors
It was very different from anything I have ever tasted
The menu made me want to taste a little of everything
Roy's is not for people who don't like to try new foods
And speaking about helpful -- I called to get directions to the establishment and I got a recording instructing me to leave a message with my phone number and they'd call me back
And they did, with a very detailed message
I can't wait to go back
My wife and I went to Roy's just the other night for our anniversary
Business seems a little slow, I would only assume of the tragic events of 9/11
The service was excellent, every person that greeted wished a us a very Happy Anniversary
My wife and I went to Roy's in Maui and Kauai last year and fell in love with it
Living in NY we wanted to relive the same moment as we did a year previous
The food was right on the money, just like the Roy's in Hawaii
In fact the food was actually better then the the Maui location that we went to, Kauai still takes the rank of number one
I had the honey mustard short ribs, we also ordered a salad before hand
Thumbs up for Roy's in NY
Thank you for making this special night just right
Happy to say that O'Hara's is back after being closed for 8 months (9/11)
Wanted to see the changes
Food was much better then I had remembered (smaller menu) Great place for lunch
The service is fast and friendly
The crowd at night is mixed and well blended lots of tourists
Great Juke box
Definitely recommend to stop by if you are downtown
I drink like an animal there on a routine basis and man, what a party it is! A popular hangout for local daytraders making serious money - even if they don't dress like it
Plenty of mullets and and angry, drunk ex-navy seals to keep you entertained
I work in Lower Manhattan, and (understandably) since 9/11, reasonable lunch-time dining options have become a bit more limited
Champ's is reasonably priced and the staff behind the grill and deli counter are friendly and polite
But after today, I'm done
Their cashiers have the poorest attitudes going
Just plain nasty and foul, not to mention unhelpful
I don't need to patronize an establishment with such substandard service attitudes
I'll brown-bag it if need be
And I've had unsolicited conversations with two coworkers who've also stopped going there for the same reason
Better open your eyes, Champ's
If three of us in the same office think this, what about the rest of downtown?
We dine out often around the city trying new places and we considered this to be average chinese restaurant
The food was not bad but not anything impressive
It were a bit pricy for lunch
The service was very good
Do not be turned away by the terrible exterior because inside it rather nice
PC Garden is a rare find
we're all so used to fast food Chinese that it's great to be reminded how good gourmet Chinese can be
The friendly staff make you feel right at home
Great ambience as well
Cool atmosphere
Try the dumplings and wash them down with one of their cool Polyenesian drinks
You won't be dissapointed!
Take a step back into a blast from the past where the food is good and the drinks are strong
Restrooms are clean and comfortable
Great cantoneese and mandarin food
Fabulous owners
Very friendly and good service
Open on the weekends which is rare in the financial district
Great food! Great Mai Tai! Great overall!
I used to eat here once a week over 4 yrs ago and it was good food service
I retired and 4yrs later I went back and they still remembered me and the food was still good and THE SAME PRICE
you get a filling portion and clean area to eat it, or take it to Hudson River in good weather
In Short The Irish restaurant at Saint George's Chapel offers pub fare such as Buffalo wings and potato skins, as well as more traditional selections of Shepherd's Pie and Bangers and Mash
At dinner, expect families dining out and worker bees catching the game on the big screen TV
Retro liquor advertisements and saloon-themed paintings decorate the restaurant's mahogany and jade green walls
An intricately carved bar, Persian rugs and roaring fireplace add ambiance
I went to Morans with my husband last week and what a find
Its like a hidden treasure
The interior is old style, elegant dark wood with the front kept in its original state of when it was a chapel
The staff were so nice, its as if they really like working there
The food as even better try the salmon welington!! Its definately worth a visit and I cannot believe I am the first to write a review about it!!!

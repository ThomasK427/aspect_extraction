I would go back for the food though
The food was mediocre, the service was snotty and inattentive
The crowd was mostly older, business people
It was not romantic at all
And for all that--it's expensive
Location street that is bascially 2 blocks long, its a hidden gem in Manhattan
Bar has a nice layout with a colorful blue background
Ambience in dining room is nice
Only thing is center tables can feel a bit uncomfortable as you feel lik you are the center of attention
Food is great with 4 course pre fixe or 7 course pre fixe
Overall the best food was the pasta
The Service was so bad I almost walked out
I had to get up and ask the Maitre'd to take our order
When my boyfriend asked for tomatoes on his salad, they acted apalled and put-upon
Questions about the menu were treated with snide or snobby comments
Never again!!!
I took my wife here for dinner
tucked away in a downtown street and is nestled between apartment buildings
The entrance way to the restaurant puts you into the bar area which was forgetfull
but the interior itself was very nice
The service was very prompt and helpful with wine suggestions
We ordered off the prixe fixe menu which allows you to pick any item off the regular menu or add 6 dollars to asterick items
The food was very good and besides the smaller portions, the goat cheese and greens salad and the tossed spaghetti was very tasty
The cod was very good but a bit soupy in vegetable juices
The desserts are decadent and they even bring over a few delicacies from the pastry chef
all in all a very good meal but when the bill came
it was a bit pricey
All in all a good experience and great service!!
The tasting menu was fabulous, but of course all the good things have extra cost associated with them
They tried to sit us in the aisle tables, where we'd be banged all the time by passersby, but we got a banquette table which was fine
Decor is cool
Service needs to improve at these prices: I had ask for bread, our plates took a little long to come out
Nice to try once, would probably not go back unless someone else was buying
I am usually a big appetizer person - but I was amazed how good the entree was @ L'impero last night! cacimpero plin (fontina, meat, truffle ravioli) was to die for! sliced dry aged sirloin was so tender and flavorful, too
would def go back there again soon to try other entree
Had a great meal at L'Impero
Was seated promptly by pleasant hosts and hostesses
The waitress was excellent in providing explanations and fulfilling requests
The prix fixe menu is an awesome deal for dining out in New York, being $52 for four courses
Highlights of the meal include the mushroom fricasse, ravioli, homemade spaghetti, and the baby goat entree
Nice warm ambiance within that subdues the dining room murmur when it gets crowded
Would definitely go back!
Trendy ambience in a very soft and restrained way, which makes this place 100 times better than other trendy places in town like 66
Sophisticated all the way - the decor, the lighting, the food, and most importantly, the outstanding wine list, organized in a very hepful navigation
Stunning, eclectic collections at relatively reasonable prices
It shows that the owner knows what to put in the list to pair with the food
I can see how some reviewers view the service as not up there - but I could not care less
The services are friendly and attentive, if not perfect
This place has SO many other positive attributes combined that I really can ignore occasional service glitches
A place for sophisticated diners and those who KNOW wines - by no means who only drink expensive bottles - instead, those who have a real passion about food and wine matching
Their website is sharp
The place is beautiful
The service is great so was the food
The roasted Portuese sardine appitizer was absolutely AMAZING
The spaghetti w/tomato basil and the ricotta raviolini w/baby tomatoes were very flavorful w/o being too rich
Branzino was great
And I topped everything off with chocolate soup w/creme fraiche panna cotta rum zabaglione --SOOO good!!!
A dreat dinner,the food was excellent, except for a few items, the service was very good except for a few items, and the presentation was excellent
Don't get me wrong, I thought this palce was great, but they just need some work in the service areas
For example, we had ordered a 2nd bottle of red wine, the waitress gave me a new glass to taste the wine, but filled up my existing glass (mixing two different bottles in one glass)
My mother had the orchettee with clams and it was very salty
The restrooms - 2 unisex stalls for a place that hold 100 people, I waited on line a lot
Lastly the waiters and bartender should learn to have argurments in private and not in front of customers
But the food is excellent and inexpensive for the type of portion
Try the Capretto- wow it was unbelievable!!
L'Impero is just below the top-notch right now - It's just a bit too noisy and crowded, and the dishes lack the spark of genius in their conception and the precision in their execution which characterize the the very best NYC restaurants
That said, I feel that we New Yorkers have become awfully jaded in our expectations
L'Impero's food is, as others have described, really nice haute Northern Italian and very fairly priced - a refreshing thought! Worth a visit, particularly if you live anywhere nearby
I had high expectations before eating here
I have eaten at many many places in NYC - especially Italian
L'Impero is in a class only a couple Italian places in the city can attain
The food was divine
The service did not meet the standards of the food or the beauty, but is fair
The creativity in the menu choices were a welcome change
BUT, the old fashion Pasta with Tomato and basil is unreal
Something so basic, but the flavors were sensational
The Tangerine Crisp dessert was a wonderful ending to a great meal
Sweet tart and just enough
One of the top 3 in NYC!
i agree with all the following reviews about the food, excellent
everybody at the table enjoyed their food and the cheeses at the end were fantastic
unfortunately i suspect we got the same waiter who ruined another reviewer's dining experience
he was terribly condescending and unhelpful
if you go, make sure you dont sit in the seating against the wall or else he will serve you and ruin your experience
My friends and I had the $49 prix fixe dinner, which includes appetizer, pasta, entree, and dessert
It was such a deal, and the food was fabulous
Between us we tried a bunch of dishes, each better than the last
I loved the salad with truffle oil, and the raviolini, as well as the sea bass
The duck and foie gras agnoletti were delicious, as were the octopus, loin of lamb, and sirloin steak
I tried sweetbreads for the first time - good, with a taste reminiscent of foie gras
Nice atmosphere, professional service
Perfect serving sizes
This is a wonderful restaurant
The ambiance is alluring and the food!!!!!! What can I say
the food is MAGNIFICENT!!!! Chef Scott know exactly what to put together and how to put it together
I have never had anything I didn't like there and I've tried a lot
I have dined in many good (4star and higher) restaurants in NYC and this was one of the BEST experiences
The food was superb and the service was even better
Our server could not have been more helpful and more attentive even though it was obviously very busy (Saturday evening)
He helped us select the perfect wine and answered all our questions on the menu with a great deal of knowledge

but who cares
it was for charity, right?!  Now to the meat of the Tasting Room: So, my native New Yorker friend and I go Tasting Room and we are very impressed by the small/quaint atmosphere
As for the food, we had the Lettuce Salad with Feta, the White Fish and the Roasted LambAll very good and recommended
However, we also had the Porcini Mushrooms and they are worth dying for
Seriously
I used to work in a restaurant and I made a point to notice how they made them
I asked my NYC friend what she thought and she responded with I will definitely eat here again!  And by the way
they have a GREAT wine selection
Service and friendliness were both perfect at this quaint local place for foodies 'in the know', but there were plenty of ups and downs
While able to secure a 10pm same-day reservation for 5 on a Friday night, we still ended up waiting 45 minutes to get in
That was greatly helped by a free round of champagne while waiting, and we appreciated the gesture
The menu is informatively presented with facts about the ingredients, and is divided into Starting and Sharing plates, which allows one to sample a few items during the meal
And the dishes were between adventurous and interesting, for the most part
That is, what was left of them
The downside to arriving late in the evening is that many of the dishes are no longer available; the food is fresh and supplied by local growers and farmers, and it appears that only the best ingredients are purchased
But there is a limited supply
Hence, of 9 Starter plates, only 6 were available
The green salad is a bit overpriced at $7 - it's somewhat simple
The veal was an utter disappointment: dry and grey, generally uninspiring
Moving on the the main dishes, we were astounded at how small the portions are
Again, a different veal dish arrived, with the same unfortunate result
The duck breast however, was exquisite: rich, soft and bursting with flavor
The Tasting Room is for serious food lovers, but not hungry ones
If I am to pay $30 for a plate billed as an entree, I do expect to be filled to a limited degree
Wine lovers will be very pleased with the wine list
My favorite New York restaurant
Adorable space, funky art on the walls, friendly, earthy staff, a fabulous wine list and AMAZING food
The best part is that you get to taste different things and everything is unique and outstanding
A truly special dining experience
The Scene A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices
You'll spy locals partaking in a familiar part of the Dumpling House experience--chatting with the friendly owner Vanessa Duan, that is when she's not bossing her frying staff around in Mandarin or packing up the joint's never-ceasing flow of orders
The Food It's hard to resist the plump, sizzling allure of the hearty boiled and fried pork dumplings
But regulars know that the sandwiches are the real star here: Choose between super-thin slices of cold cured beef or creamy tuna salad (tossed deliciously with peas), stuffed between fat, steaming-hot wedges of freshly fried sesame scallion bread and generously topped with cilantro, pickled carrot, and a pungent mix of black malted vinegar and soy sauce
For a savory take on the soup and sandwich meal, try the hot and sour soup
Where else in NYC can two dine for $5? For $5, you get 2 cans of soda and 15 dumplings
On a nice day, just dine in the nearby park
Dumplings are excellent and also love the sesame pancake with beef ($1
50)
You really can't get any better value than this! Place gets crowded quickly and service is not the greatest but for the price, you can't complain
need i say more? 5 dumplings for $1 or a YUMMY sesame pancake for only 50 cents! where else can you get a WHOLE MEAL for these prices? it's hot and tastes great, and your wallet feels just as heavy afterwards!
On my first night at my apartment in TriBeCa, i ordered pizza from Caf Amore and have been in love ever since
They have excellent sauce, speedy delivery and great cheese
Highly recommended!!
There were a variety of toppings available and the staff was very accomodating of any combination requested
Delivery was fast
The location did not allow for dining, but it's a good place for lunch
The staff was courteous
Kosher Creations staff did everything they said they would and more! The food was amazing and the service was warm and friendly! I highly recommend them
The pizza here is so horrible
The cheese is glopped on really thick and the sauce tastes like it came right out of a tin can
Couldn't you guys do something with it first
HORRIBLE pizza! As a matter of fact, alot of the pizzarias around here serve horrible pizza
Hands down to LB Spumoni Gardens in Brooklyn
On a recent outing to Brooklyn, my friends took me to this place
Absolutely wonderful! You guys can learn from them! Yuck! One word for your pizza! YUCK!!!!!
Don't expect Italian dining when you come to Fat Sal's
You can sit down and watch TV with the cooks, or do like I do, and take it home to eat
The pizza is simple and tasty
But, my recommendation is the clam sause pasta
It is absolutely delicious, and affordable
By the way, the cooks and delivery boys are actually quite friendly, if you do decide to eat in!
This is quite possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life
The crust was insanely thin and soaked with oil
I ordered Pintaile's pizza last night for the first time and I really like it
The crust is thin and whole wheat and the ingredients are fresh and healthy
I ordered a canadian bacon and pinapple and a neopolitan and both were great
The service was speedy as well
It took only about 30 min for delivery and the pizza was hot and fresh
I will definitely order from here again and I like that fact that it is a healthier twist on pizza
I ordered from here last week
They have wheat crusted pizza made with really fresh and yummy ingredients
I had the Gobble Gobble, which was ground turkey, with lowfat ricotta, and fresh tomato sauce
It was delish and I didn't feel bad eating it
Their twist on pizza is heatlhy, but full of flavor
on a really cold day, stopped in for a quick bite- can't beat dollar hot-dogs; but they were diff't
i could see the crunchy casing on the ends
pizza looked good though, and the owner (?) was a nice guy
I had some friends in town last week, and I took them here, since there isn't much else in K-Town to go to
We had a blast! Within 1 hour we were talking to everyone in the place
The waitstaff introduced us to the entire bar
They have some great drinks
try the SOJU, Korean Rice Wine, around $20 a bottle, but well worth it
Great time, lots of attractive people, a bit expensive
I took a party of around 15 people here
And not only were was the waitstaff extremely rude
But drinks were $11 and in plastic cups
Don't waste your time
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you

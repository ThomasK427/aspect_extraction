WARM DOUGHNUTS mmmm
Delicious! Oh yeah and Liv Tyler was there too! A perfect NYC outing
If you're looking for a fun place to go with friends, there are dozens of other places in the LES
But if you like to feel like your important ordering $12 drinks and $5 White Castle burgers than this is the place for you
But the waitresses are hot
The food here is wonderful! It's great for groups- really fun atmostphere
The service is fantastic and the crowd is great
Overall, a perfect find
Cheers to Chris Santos for another great restaurant!
This is the exact type of place that New York City dining needs
An amazingly gorgeous setting, a fun atmosphere, courteous service, beautiful people, a bit of scene, yet totally accesible to anyone walking in
I came with a large party (9 people) and was told that our table wouldn't be ready for twenty minutes
Our disappointment lasted all of the twenty seconds it took the professional and genuine owner to escort our party upstairs to the most outrageously sexy lounge
Within two minutes champagne cocktails were served to us, and (FREE) appetizers arrived
We were seated within the twenty mintues and our meal was excellent
Our server did a wonderful job of guiding us through the somewhat tricky menu and the owner stopped by to make sure our experience was everything we had hope for
It was and then some
This restaurant is so beautifully designed and such thought was taken into the ambiance, from the mirrors on the wall to the sunken booths in the lounge
This does not even touch upon the service and the food
The coctails were imaginative and delicious, the food was exactly what the descriptions said it would be
I have eaten at Chef Santos' other restaurants and this is by far his best
The snapper tacos leave you longing for more, the baked oysters rockafeller were delicious, and the meatballs were just like grandma would make, if grandma made meatballs
My friends and I also loved the perogis and the cookie plate
Yum
Thanks, Stanton Social, for making food that's always been great just a bit better
My friend and I were roaming the LES for Saturday-night dinner and stumbled upon this place
We didn't have reservations, and showing up at 8:45 we were told it would be about an hour wait
The menu looked amazing, though, so we decided to grab drinks nearby and come back
We waited the rest of the time in the excellent 2nd floor lounge
Wow, am I glad we waited
The Ancho carmel glazed pork tenderloin was incredible, as was the fig and blue cheese pizzetta
We went with the server's recommendation and enjoyed the Warm donuts with three dipping sauces for dessert
Each dish had great presentation and excellent flavor
My out of town friend was raving the entire meal
This is a great place to take guests for a trendy New York dining experience
I will definitely be back again (next time with a reservation)
Have been 3 times and cant wait to go back
The lower east side is lucky to have such a special restaurant
The dining room downstairs is very comfortable and the lounge upstairs (where you can eat to) is awesome
But this place has more then just good looks going for it, Chris Santos fomerly of Suba and Wyanoka is doing his thing
With over 40 items on the menu, meant for sharing, this guy can really show his depth
The french onion soup dumplings are off the charts as are the meatballs and 3 types of sliders
I am in heaven! There are so many options you will want to go back to try them all
Great place for dinner or late night for a few drinks and something to eat, the kitchen will be open till 3am
This place has gotten better all around with every visit
Sadly, I've got no idea what this place is like
I wasn't invited  sob
I agree with the other reviews as far as the lovely decor goes, however the service leaves alot to be desired
After arriving promtly with our party of 18 we were told that our reserved table had been given away to another large party
The owner kindly gave us appetizers on the house to make our now, long wait, more pleasant, but of course they took forever to arrive and were insufficient
As for drinks, once the waitress finally took our order, we were left extreamly thirsty as drinks also took a while
The hostess, while very pretty and pleasant was quite useless in rectifying the situation
This is just a small taster of our experience at The Stanton Social
It may be a great location for smaller groups and I would love to go back to be able to change this review- but very much doubt I will dare
We arrived for a booking to find our table would be ready in 45 minutes
45 minutes passed and its now 10
15 and we were yet to eat
We were offered free appetizers to compensate
3 deep fried mums gone to iceland token efforts at buffet food later and our table still wasnt ready - Another 45 minutes we were informed
At this point we walked out
Suffice to say I will not be returning to this all style and no substance rip off merchants palace
Expensive, Terrible service and rubbish concept - hmm lets all eat tiny portions because we like to share
Rubbish! Spend your hard earned money elsewhere! (In My Opinion)
What a great place to eat and enjoy
the food was very well prepared and the staff always wore a smile, the design is beautifful, classic and modern all mixed into one
You have to try and see for yourself
Still seems like they are working out the kinks (long wait ven with reservation, etc
), but its a beautiful space with tasty drinks and pretty nice food
I thought the raw bar was especially good
Also, very well priced
The place looks wonderful, great setting and decor but the food was just average, nothing special and really it's just expensive tapas labeled as share plates
They recommend 2 to 3 dishes per person but it really isn't alot of food more than decor
The bar lounge is nice upstairs, the bar itself is beautiful but then after you order drinks and find that it's $12 a piece you get turned off
$12 drinks on the Lower East Side?  My meal and drinks came out to about $76 without tip, I had 2 drinks and 5 dishes and left to Rosario's for a slice afterwards to fill the gap
Definitely worth a shot (dine at your own risk) but not worth the value
If you're looking to impress people then go here, if you just want to enjoy a meal with fair prices
there are better options in NYC and LES
The meal was amazing (although a bit small for the big boys)
The French Onion Soup Dumplings were outstanding
The drinks were a bit small but tasty! Overall, a wonderful place that will be frequented by all Manhattanites!
The dim lights and wide space makes this restaurant great for groups or a romantic date
The food is impeccable, finally a trendy restaurant with a menu that won't intimidate inexperienced palates
Went there on the advice of a friend who was at the opening party and I was instantly impressed by the overall apearance and design of the space
Great atmosphere although a little noisy as is to be expected
Our server was extra cordial and attentive to us even though the place was packed
Our food and drinks were served promptly and both were nothing short of amazing
and the bill was not too spendy for what we ordered
Dont forget warm doughnuts and caramel for dessert!
In Short Pulsing ambient music and dramatic decor, including a large Buddha statue, up-lit bamboo and a fish tank in the floor, attract a 30-something cocktail crowd
The menu offers traditional sushi, including various tunas and sea urchin, as well as signature rolls like salmon-jalapeno and spicy crab and caviar
Entrees include steak or chicken Ishi-Yaki (served on a hot stone grill), miso- and sake-marinated sea bass and sake- and ginger-glazed lamb chops
A bunch of friends and I went to Aja last Saturday
Nice peaceful atmosphere
Small Tao-like Buddha
plus goldfish
The food was well prepared and well-presented
We only had appetizers, many of which were really good: the Thai Spice Chicken Wraps were delicious and spicy in a good way
The crab dumplings were average
The Wu-Xi baby ribs were the usual, but good
I don't recommend the Gold Coins

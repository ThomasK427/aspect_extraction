Will be back for sure
All I have to say is that this place is amazing
Great food, drinks, music, and ambience all for a great price
Also, I got a chance to meet the owner and he was really cool as well, and bought my group a round of beverages
All in all, a great place
This place has an exciting, modern atmosphere
The food is always amazing, really cheap, and the portions are pretty big, i'ver never finished my food
The bar is great too
I enjoy the loud music and the DJ, but it bothers some people
I've never waited more than 20 mins on a weekend, but you can have a drink at the bar and your name is called before you know it
Everyone should definately try it!
I've eaten at Song twice, and have been blown away on both occasions
Even on an extremely busy Saturday night, I was seated within 15 minutes
The food is even better- I've had the mango salad (an excellent starter), the shrimp kra-prow with sticky rice, and the sweet sticky rice w/ mango for dessert
All were outstanding
My boyfriend had the chicken panang, which he raved about
The food is so good, and for the price, you can't beat it
My favorite Park Slope restaurant at the moment
The food is excellent and fresh and incredibly reasonable
Song is fabulous, even better than the original Joya
The place is bigger and more convenient to people in the slope
I highly recommend the mango martini and spicy noodles
Amazing
The food is unlike any other Thai place in the city
They are so speedy with the food and you can see the cooks working their magic in the kitchen
Watch out, no credit cards accepted!
Went to Song the first time with a group of people
I was very surprised by how good the food was and the big portion for $6
95
The wait staff is attentive and the music is great
I have found my new favorite dinning spot
Like it's sister restaurant Joya, Song is utterly fantastic
Prices are the lowest in the slope for Tai (and just about any cuisine), the food is unreal, the portions are intense, and the atmosphere is killer (DJ spinning eclectic 80's, etc)
I went on a Friday night at 8:30 with 3 other people - we were seated in about 25 mins, which is the perfect amount to get a drink or two at the bar (which is also killer)
I have been living the the slope for 2 years, and not only is Song the best Thai restaurant, it maybe my favorite overall (for now
)
Plus, they have free delivery!
Everything about this place is great
The food, the ambience, and the prices!!! They make great cosmos
Who needs to go anywhere else when we have such a fabu restaurant right here in the Slope? Definitely try the spicy noodles with chicken :-)
The Scene Groups cluster at the dark wood tables in the bi-level space
Solo diners enjoy bar seats, especially those at the second-floor bay window
Ebony colored bamboo, smooth stone embellishments and an entryway waterfall provide an especially relaxing backdrop for a lunchtime respite
The Food The ubiquitous cooktops give a not-so-subtle hint for what to order
Though both soupy dishes seem similar on the surface, sukiyaki, which the staff cooks for you, is the more flavorful option, drawing its taste from beef, soy sauce, butter, onions, burdock and mushrooms
With shabu shabu, the diner must swish meat or seafood in a vegetable-heavy broth at the table
Carpaccio-thin pork and beef are best for the dish, as seafood proves unwieldy with chopsticks and chicken tends to end up with an undesirable texture
The soft serve green tea and sesame ice cream are exceptionally refreshing after either steaming dish
Great place to Drink, Eat and Enjoy one's self
I love the food which is recommended by one of the owers, Jenny
I love the bartenders, who are usually Japanese gals with very nice personalities and great looks
Also has Asahi beer on tap
good list of Saki and carries Jagermeister
this place was really horrible, i know they had some good reviews and thats why i went but i regret spending a cent and my time!!! NOT RECOMMENDED
My friend and I walked into Shaburi on a whim for dinner last night, and we had a great time
The decor was very chic, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was healthy and delish
I'm not generally impressed by very many restaurants, but this place actually impressed me
annoying management and a boring atmosphere with servers hovering over tables and an owner/manager that won't let her customers alone
the shabu shabu was interesting, though i was dripping sweat by the time i was done
this concept would work if the owners knew something about running a restaurant
or at the least, learn how to turn the air conditioning on
This place just opened 3/1/05
If you're sick of regular old sushi and want to try another japanese culinary tradition, head on over here
No place else in the city does authentic shabu-shabu and sukiyaki like Shaburi
If you don't know what that is, you must give it a try
It's best with a group of friends
Their appetizers are awesome too (I love the Carpaccio and Tofu salad)
Lunch is reasonably priced and comes with entree, soup, dessert and coffee
The coffee here is a must try: I was told each cup was individually brewed and it tastes it
Two floors, VIP room, full bar with sak-tails (sake cocktails)
Decor looks great
Wait staff is friendly
Give it a whirl before it gets too crowded
Instead of making the trek down to midtown or the village for rolls, I decided to try this place
I had the Chicken rolls - fantastic stuff
Two rolls for 7 bucks - now that is cheap
This place like most others is open late
I am vegetarian - so this review applies only to the veg portion of their menu
Their rolls are tasty and they will customize it for you - I ask for extra onions and tomatoes and ask them to add the spicy chutney
They have a wide selection of veggie options - Paneer (cheese), Alu (potatoes), Palak Panneer (Spinach and Cheese), Okra, Mushroom and Tofu
Their hot alu fries (potato chips) are very nice - just make sure you ask for them to be made crisp
I ATE at this place the day it opened
initially indeed it was good, but over the time it has gone worse to horrible
tonite i had paneer frankies AND THEY were HORRIBLE!!! the bread was thick, sticky, and the filling was non-existent
with mainly onions and tomatoes
maybe some paneer as seasoning!!!
and they have raised proces since opening
maybe poor columbia students go there for cheap eats but not worth it otherwise!!!
Delicious sandwiches - I especially recommend the tofu mushroom frankie
A great value and nice change from burgers and tacos
went on a saturday night arrived at 9, the place was empty
The service was HORRIBLE
the waitress was lost/confused
took her a really long time to clear a table for us then it took her a few min to realize that we didn't have a menu
The food was delicious, but way OVERPRICED and small portions
I asked for hot sauce more rice and that took her about 15 min to bring to us
was charged for the hot sauce and 5$ for a tiny portion of rice
I'm a big fan of dive spots, but this one was horrible
the bill came up to be 40$ (which isn't much BUT compared to the small portions, lack of service, no decor, it was way overpriced)
We left feeling ripped off

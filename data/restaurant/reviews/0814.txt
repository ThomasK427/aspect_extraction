I've ordered a range of dishes and the majority of them are pretty good
It really depends on what you order because some may be tasty while others bland
They have an extensive menu with some authentic Chinese dishes
Getting your meal can be quite confusing
It's always crowded and hectic with the employees screaming out orders that are ready
You basically order, wait, as soon as they call your order, go up to the register, pay and leave
So although not the best restaurant, you can find some pretty good dishes here for a great price
Where else in Rockefeller Center can you get lunch for under $5?
I am surprised that no one has reviewed Tulcingo Del Valle
It is really the best mexican here in new york
I spent a lot of time in Mexico on business and had a hard time eating Mexican food here in NYC because its all terrible
Until I was introduced to this place
Its Most authentic
Best tasting
Cheap
Very quick delivery
I found out about the place from a friend from Mexico City who loves this place - says when he's homesick he goes here for the pozole
Try the Cecina (salty beef) its a little like the sun dried beef in Monterrey, delicious
Great tortillas, pozole, tacos, etc
I've been working in this building for eight years and I've never seen a deli come around that charges as much as this place does for a basic lunch
A wrap and bottle of water costs over $10, which might be worth if it if their food wasn't just mediocre at best
On a pouring wet day they're convenient, but with other delis in the area that give you a sandwich, salad and a soda for under $6, I wonder why anyone other than the tourists would frequent this place
Another case in point: a Red Bull which costs about $1
99 in any normal deli costs a whoppin' $3
50 plus tax in this joint
Avoid it
Step into this place, and you will have no idea you are still in Penn Station
The raw bar is awesome and the bar tenders are some of the nicest people I have ever met
I always try to time my arrival to penn station to allow for at least a drink, if not a meal, at this venerable mid-town restaurant
After work, it's also a great place to meet people, after a beer or two, everyone starts talking
Located right in the heart of Penn Station, Tracks offers awesome drinks and lots of crowds
Also the bar food is awesome
It's my favorite restaurant in the city!! Swear to God! You'll love it
this is the best bar i been to
The staff is friendly
The food there is great
it is a must to visit there
It is a very happening place, great place to stop by before getting on the LIRR or meeting someone at penn station
it is a must to try
The clam and oyster's there are fresh
i was there a couple days back with a few friends
but to my astonishment the food there was excellent and the staff there were so friendly
the rolls they made very beautiful and tasty you will never expect a small restaurant with such low price to serve such beautifully made sushi which can be compared to those very highly priced sushi place in Manhattan
i was told that they have an even better place in east side brooklyn on Ave U i highly recommend this restaurant
i eat here frequently
whenever i have a craving for some katsu don, chicken katsu, udon w/ ebi tempura, FRIED ICE CREAM, dragon/tempura rolls, etc
the staff know me pretty well
i always get my fav
roll- the philly (philadelphia roll), the shrimp tempura roll, and boston roll
(all COOKED if you're curious
haha)
their sashimi (raw fish) is pretty fresh and good, too
their a la carte and dinner menus are always decent priced and good portions
a lot of bay ridge kiddos go there
it's yummy, the staff is oh-so nice and attentive
the music is never annoying, and good value
there's this one roll
sooo GOOD! it's battered on the outside of roll
deep fry for a min
and it's crunchy, chewy, and oh-so good
just like the fried icecream
a MUST-TRY!
Japanese restuarants are usually on the expensive side but this one is not
Sushi is quite tasty and the rolls are nicely wrapped
I order Ebi Tempura Roll and Rainbow Roll every time I visit
However, the only decoration in the restaurant is the handwritten Japanese words on the wall and a few banners
The food is really good the atmosphere is pleasnent and wonderful everybody is really sweet and great
Tony makes the absolute best cheesburger in Brooklyn, maybe the world!  The meat is always freshly ground, hand formed and cooked to perfection, with love! That's the main ingredient!  Bagels, bialy's, eggs, 'Knish Nosh' knishes (Arthur Schwartz says they're the best!) all kinds of rolls and breads and the freshest coldcuts
Hot foods selection every weekday for lunch
Unreal mac and cheese when they have it!
In Short Since 1964, when the first Arby's opened in Ohio, its roast beef sandwiches have been a popular hamburger alternative
The chain's signature red-and-tan color scheme and cowboy hat signage make it easy to spot
The menu features several variations on the classic Arby's sandwich--thin-sliced beef topped with barbecue sauce, cheese sauce or other toppings--as well as jalapeno poppers and assorted milk shakes, including the signature Jamocha flavor
This is a gem
Arby's did a great job with the ;seating and the 50's atmosphere thrown in with new age problems
Food is great, the jammoca sheke is tremendous but there is a highschool nearby and the place can get loud and packed
Best to come early or late and avoid them
Prices are what you would find in any other fast food returant, but it's style is unique and worth it at least oncei in your life to try some Arby's
The Scene Rustic touches like colored tiles and tin lanterns add charm to this aptly named spot in the heart of Soho
A hard-drinking, upscale crowd, holding conversations over loud Latin jazz music, packs the small, open dining room and attached bar
On busy nights, service is pressed to keep up
The Food The kitchen refines hearty Mexican classics with delicious results
Nachos pre-assembled and arranged in individual bites, with crumbled sausage and avocado on top, make for fun, mess-free eating
Shell steak is big and flavorful; shrimp sauteed in a powerful garlic sauce are sweet and succulent
Taquitos, with pork, roasted beef and other fillings, create a fine snack or an excellent meal when ordered in quantity
Some dishes disappoint, like watery ceviche and lettuce-padded quesadillas
But desserts, including a dark cinnamon-chocolate cake, tequila-soaked plantains and tres leches cake, are surefire winners
Great spot for drinks and comida from South of the Border
Bartender from Spain could mix a solid drink and waitress was a sweetheart
Check this place out
We went to their new location on Elizabeth street
The food was extremely bad and service was terrible
They brought us a raw steak when we ordered medium/well andthe waitress argued for five min that the steak was medium
Also the barmen is very new and he does not know how to make the drinks (yet!) I would not recommend at all
The restaurant is in a nice, quiet place in Soho
The biggest advantage is the outdoor seating
While I enjoyed sitting outdoors, the food was bland, and badly cooked
It was worse than any Mexican restaurant that I tried in New York
Furthermore, it was on the expensive side
It might be a good place to have a drink, but not for food

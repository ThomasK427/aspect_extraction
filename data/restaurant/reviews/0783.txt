Went for restaurant week (lunch)
The atmosphere is fantastic
Very welcoming
Service was decent
Food was very good
But, absent the pre-fixed menu prices, it's a little pricey for what you get
Chips and guacamole are extra, and pale in comparison to Rosa Mexicana guac
I had the ceviche which was superb
My lunch companion got a chilled corn soup which was just alright
I reccommend the fish, any kind
It was cooked to perfection
Overall, a nice lunch in a nice place
Would consider returning
Staff was extremely welcoming
The upstairs dining room is amazing
You really feel as if you have left the city
A lot of thought went into the design of this space
Try to plan ahead so you can make a reservation for the outside roof terrace
It's perfect
Our waiter was very helpful with our selections
Even though the entire dining room was packed, we still had amazing service
The food did not disappoint either
We all had drinks, apps, main course and shared deserts and it was about $90 each
but worth it
I walked by on Sunday evening and decided to check it out
My sister and I were so grateful for finding this gem amongst so many NYC restaurants
We had the swordfish dip, and lobster tacos which were delicious
the dessert was breathtaking the chocolate frlan is like non other
I can't wait to go back in the summer when the manager said they will open the patio
Okay, so I didn't love this place and I didn't necessarily hate it until the bill came
I don't mind paying such prices for a thoroughly enjoyable food experience
So how was the total experience? The service was excelente! Lovely decor, bright and airy upstairs (though I went on a balmy summer day, so it was a bit too hot to sit upstairs but otherwise I think it's the best seat in the house)
The mojitos were delicious and most of our appetizers were great
Entrees were another story
I was with a big group and I would say that most of us were just satisfied or unhappy with our dishes
Reading all of the reviews here I would be willing to give Pampano another try and hope for the best
I recently attended a birthday gathering at Pompano, and honestly, I had my hesitations
I thought it might be slightly stuffy because of its midtown location,but my party was warmly greeted by a welcoming host who sat us promptly
I'm not in love with tequila and didn't know if there would be an adequate variety of alternative cocktails
But, after a delicious mojito I was persuaded to try a hybiscus margarita that has changed my drinking habits
The wine was also superb (a manger guided us through the list and recomended a spanish albarino which complimented and enhanced our civeches and our seafood entrees) So many of the dishes were great for sharing and each with such unique flavors and characteristics
Pompano (and their staff) did alot to improve my skepticism toward midtown restaurants
Keep doing what your doing, I've got quite a few aries in my circle of friends
Went here for Valentines Day
Big mistake
The total for 2 people was around 250 bucs
Pampano should not be able to command these kinds of prices
The service was poor, they brought out the wrong dish twice
The steak came to the table rare to medium rare so I had to send it back
The baby red snapper on the other hand was dry and over cooked
The orangish soup we tried tasted like it had sawdust in it
They did not even ask us what we wanted for desert
Stay away from this place, its terrible
If you want to spend 200 plus for a dinner there are many places in NYC that are so much better
Look at the other negative reviews too!
The food at Pompano is indeed delicious - start off with the guacamole, the ceviche and filet mignon tacos make great appetizers and the fish entrees certainly will not disappoint
Delicious food, unfortunately the sangria was a disaster
Service was extremely quick, courteous and attentive
Romantic setting
I'm not from France, so I like to eat regular portions of food, not food meant for models
The food is overpriced, and the taste is ok at best
I orderd a Filet Mignon which was on the smaller side
I mean it looked nice on the plate, but I don't want to eat ART, I came to eat food
I also orderd the 3 cevishes, which is a combination of tuna, shrimp and halibut I believe, I mean come on are you kidding me, my 3 year old nephew can eat more that this
My wife orderd a dinner entre as well (forget what it was) and it was finished in 4 maybe 6 bites
Don't go here if you hate flushing money down the toilet
Amazing and Truely Mexican Food!!!  The decor is nice, the service is very proffesional
I LOVED IT!!!! Highly recommended!!!
Who could ever think that Mexican food was so different in the coast? Pampano offers a variety of fish and seafood that you would never have expect in Mexican Cuisine
Their dish presentations are great, with a contemporary feel, and service is excellent, attentive, warm, and professional
Try their specialty drinks, margaritas are made with fresh fruit, and order the smoked swordfish dip, it is a great alternative to guacamole
For entre, get the whole red snapper or the shrimp
And PLEASE do not leave with out trying the chocoflan for dessert, it is such a delight that it melts in you mouth
If you are expecting the abundant typical tex-mex food, Pampano is not the right place for you
Our experience was great
The staff is friendly and accomodating
We made a reservation for 7:45 on a Friday, we arrived there on time
We were asked to wait for a few minutes at the bar (this wasn't what we were hoping for, after all we did have a reservation ) The bartender was so we didn't mind the wait
Our table was ready shortly
We were seated in the upstairs dinning room, which is amazing
Our server asked if it was our first visit and it was
He described each dish for us
We decided to let him order for us
the choices were great
Everything was so good
tasty, spicy and fresh
If you don't mind getting your hands dirty the Camarones Talla are a must
I would go back in a heartbeat, and would not mind waiting at the bar !!!!
if you are looking for typical mexican fare you are at the wrong place
if you're looking for a mexican chef who gets rather adventuresome when trying to meld seafood and mexican spices vegetables
then youve come to the right place
i was very pleased with my meal, both my appetizer (scallops watermelon grilled catcus) and entree (halibut with mexican chorizo, beans spices) were both dishes i had never seen or tried before and both had excellent flavor
the service was very attentive friendly speedy
the two strikes against this place is that the portions are too small, we left a bit hungry and that in the winter time the upstairs room can be quite cold drafty given that it's designed for summer outdoor dining
great place, very different mexican meal
The only thing Mexican about this restaurant was their use of cilantro
Although the ambience was very nice, this trendy Mexican restaurant simply tries too hard
The food was nothing to write home about
The entrees were unimaginative, unappetizing, overpriced, and, to say the least, American with a hint of Latin cuisine
The cornbread desert was warm and soggy

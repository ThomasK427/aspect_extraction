A group of us went for a Friday night dinner - so perfect
The food was great, the service was spot on and the bill was reasonable
And how can you resist a place with such bathrooms?
What a lovely, cozy place
So warm
The scallops were simply amazing
And I had a salad to start with an air dried cheese and asparagus
Terrific! My service was great
Attentive, but not overbearing
My date had a wonderful time too
Her pasta was superb
Affordable and delicious wine
I'm looking forward to my next visit
My husband said to just get off the train in Little Italy and you will find something delicious
And did we ever
Va Tutto was friendly and intimate
The owner gave us wine recommendations and samples at the bar
The gnocchi was the best I have ever had in my life - melt-in-your-mouth good
All other gnocchi is now ruined for me
While walking around with out-of-town guests in Little Italy we all began to feel a little uneasy about the dining prospects as we had to walk in the streets to avoid the masses
But then we got off the main drag and found Va Tutto! It was by far the best dining experience I've had in New York City
We all shared our food because we each wanted the other person to know how good our dishes were
The Gnocci was absolutely incredible
I will certainly come back and recommend to others as well
Something has shifted for the better in this neighborhood favorite of mine
I always enjoyed the sweet garden and fine, affordable meals but it's evolved beautifully
What was always solid Italian fare has become something more elegant, delicious and overall it just feels so much more nourishing
In every way
The new Gnocchi are incredible
Too light and fluffy and yummy to be believed
Think more ricotta and less potato
Finally, I've found a great vegetable lasagna within walking distance
Hooray
The service is attentive, but never fussy
Oh
and I LOVE the Tiramisu Parfait
The perfect atmosphere to have that special date you've looked forward to for so long
I am not one to write reviews, but I just have to say what a great dining experience I had at Va Tutto
It was sooo refreshing to be able to sit in such a beautiful garden in the middle of Manhattan
We had a simple dinner with a super fresh arugula and tomato salad and some great pastas
We found the prices to be very reasonable and the service well informed and friendly
I really am suprised to read some of the negative comments
I found Va Tutto to be a wonderful neighborhood place with great food, unforced service and a magical garden
We'll be back
Hope the weather cooperates!
I had lunch here for the first time and was totally disappointed
They were out of few dishes, only to tell us 10minutes after we ordered
The staff had no idea who ordered what, bringing dishes to wrong tables all the time
We had to wait 30mins
for the appetizers, and the dishes weren't even hot
Not a single word when we were leaving
Will never return!
I haven't been to such a nice and cozy restaurant in a long time
The food is above average
I had the skirt steak and the argula salad
It was delicious
The veal chop looked great as well
The service was great
The outdoor garden was nice too
Restroom was clean too, an added plus
this place has totally delicious food, good wine, all at totally reasonable prices--but i would NEVER send anyone else here unless i knew the hostess would be off that night (fyi, i've been here a number of times and she has, unfortunately, always been there)
on an empty tuesday night, she made my mother and i stand by the bathroom (or, she offered, outside in the freezing cold) while we waited for the third in our party to arrive
(and no, they do not take reservations)
this woman has some serious social malfunction; she is nasty, petty, and totally disagreeable, but she is the only major negative if you're looking for good, inexpensive food downtown
From the minute we walk through the door, we were accosted by a hostess that refused to seat us in the empty restauraunt (we had a part of 5 with one person running late)
When we told her we wanted to order food, and get a glass a wine, she told us there were many bars and we should do that
NICE
Finally, we asked for a table away from the drafty door, but we were seated right next to the door
The food was ok, but then the bill came
Our great hostess blindly added tip to our bill--- She said it was policy for parties over 5
I asked
she conceded it wasn't written anywhere
She removed the gratuity, We left
As we were leaving, she had the nerve to make snide comments that tourists should make resevations or go elsewhere
Worst Hostess Ever!
This is one of the worst places I have ever been to
I usually do not bother to write reviews, but the management (particularly one woman) at this restaurant was so nasty that it is worth my time to post a negative review
There are so many good, affordable italian restaurants in the city that you should not waste your time with this one - it's not worth it
A friend recommended this place because of the pasta which wasnt all that bad
However, our experience was the worst restaurant experience ever
First of all, two of us ordered different salads with different dressings
We asked for a side of dressing but the waiter told us that all the salads just had oil and vinegar so we should just use the oil and vinegar that was on the table
We got our meals and my wife was supposed to have a white wine saucejust oil of course
When we told the waiter, he said he will have them put some more on
When we told the manager, she became completely defensive and started yelling at us
She was the rudest most irrational person ever, and outright mean
We got up and left and will never go back to this place again
I strongly recommend that you never go there
Once upon a time, I would have recommended this amazing Italian Soho restaurant to anyone and everyone
I live just around the corner and have tasted most of the dishes on this impressively copious menu
However, I recently invited my brother and sister-in-law to join me
When we brought to the attention of the manager that one of our meals was unsatisfactory, she engaged in the most intolerable, obnoxious behavior I have ever encountered from a restaurateur
Now, I would not even send my most hated enemy to encounter the wrath of its miserably-rude manager
I was a frequent customer, but now I will never return
This place was a great find for dinner
The list of pastas seems to run forever, and I considered just letting the waiter recommend a dish
The waiters, although very friendly, did not seem overly familair with the specific dishes beyond what I could read on the menu
Never mind, the my rigatoni with lamb, mushrooms, finocchio, and herbs was al dente and finger-licking good
This may be the best pasta I've had outside of Italy
The place is absurdly cheap for the neighborhood

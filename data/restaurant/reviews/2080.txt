and it's a slow sports night
--Drink Club is a roving group of NYC Drinkers
This is one of my favorite bars in the city, and I've never had a bad experience and have easily been there at least 50 times
The food is excellent, they have great drink specials every day of the week, plus happy hour, and a good juke box
Multiple screens to view your sport of pleasure
A 20/30 somethings crowd, and a great place for groups of friends
Highly recommended
In Short This simple spot buzzes on weekends as guests pack the booths and crowd the tables
Cheat on Atkins with the apple cinnamon breakfast bread or the equally tempting vanilla buttermilk pancakes
Or stock up on protein with egg dishes like migas, omelets and breakfast burritos
The cheddar jalapeno grits have a kick but aren't overwhelmingly spicy
Diners detect a touch a modesty in the restaurant's name because the brunch is all-around outstanding
I have been eating here pretty regularly for several years now and can say with confidence that it is among my very favorite restaurants in the city
The atmosphere of Good is unpretentious yet lovely and the food is consistently outstanding and inventive
This is a great place for a sophisticated, romantic meal (try an appetizer and entree, I recommend the bruschetta and the molasses glazed tuna- but make sure to save room for banana chocolate chip bread pudding), but it is also conducive to a casual meal- they have tasty burgers and spicy mac and cheese! In either case, you must try one of their specialty cocktails- they're not cheap ($10), but are made with fresh ingredients and are absolutely delicious
I recommend the frozen blackberry vodka julep for a hot summer day
BY THE WAY, go early for dinner (before 7) and you can try an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert for $25
For the quality of the food, you won't find a better deal
Brunch is tasty too- the atmosphere is far more casual and the pace is much faster
Be prepared to wait alongside much of the neighborhood
We live in the neighborhood and eat dinner at good on a regular basis
The food is consistently delicious and inventive, the service is reliably friendly (if we want to sit and drink a cocktail before we order it's no problem, if we're in a rush we can get served quickly), and the atmosphere is adult and unpretentious
It's great for celebrating special occasions or for grabbing a quick burger
I went with three friends on a Friday night and we had a great experience
Being health consious I thought I might have a hard time (my friends always rave about the comfort food at Good)
But there are lots of healthy choices--I had a tasty harvest salad and a salmon entree that was perfectly cooked and wasn't swimming in sauce
My friends had the pulled pork and the burgers--which they loved--and we all left happy
The vibe is relaxed and unpretentious--a nice change from so many restaurants in Manhattan
Maybe brunch is great--I've never been--but dinner was so much more than I expected, especially for the price
went there for brunch
service was excellent and the food was delicious
the stuffed french toast is highly recommended
I was surprised that this restaurant was rated so high
The decor was mediocre and honestly, I can get a better brunch at a Cracker Barrel restaurant
The side order of ham was way overcooked and dried
I could barely cut it with the table knife
The toast was toasted like melba toast and burnt in some areas
What a disappointment Easter brunch was! Gosh! I don't think I will ever return to this place again
There are SO many other nicer places to go to in Manhattan
My party of 6+2 babies turned into 7+1 baby and they didn't skip a beat
Half our party even arrived 25 minutes late and they still were able to shuffle things around so that we were seated comfortably 10 minutes BEFORE the last person in our party arrived
The staff was so supportive of us and helped us maneuver our stroller so well, that we tacked on an additional $20 onto our very reasonable bill (less than $200 for 7 brunches, plus drinks and desserts, including tip!!!), and we were so grateful, we even gave something to the hostess for being so nice to us
I will tell all my friends about this experience!! Kudos to you, Good!
Went for brunch with our daughter and boyfriend for our first meal in NYC and it was great
The Vanilla Buttermilk and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were delightful, perfectly done and subtly flavored
The B
L
T Frittata and Breakfast Burrito were also excellent, as was the atmosphere
Have bookmarked it for next visit
Went there yesterday for Mother's Day
We were 1/2 hour early for our reservation, but the host gladly seated us immediately
We ordered the bread basket with Cheddar Cornbread, Apple-Cinnamon breakfast bread, and orange sour cream doughnuts
We also had the egg platter, vanilla-coconut pancakes, and the Good signature breakfast (little bit of everything)
The food was spectacular and very reasonably-priced
The service was attentive but not overly so and very friendly
Bonus: FRESHLY SQUUEZED orange juice!
I've been here a couple of times-the first I was hungover and blamed the bland food on my own tormented tastebuds--the second, I blamed my grandmother's Italian heritage for spoiling me with a real Fritatta making theirs seem boring and uneventful
This time, I know
it's not me
It's them
With burnt breads, bland flavors (hiding coyly under beautiful presentation, this place is an overpriced pain in the wallet
I paid 50
00 for 2 biscuits, 2 omelettes and two coffees
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Lookout for the 1
75 charge for daring to order egg whites
Blech
This is another delicious find thanks to the Diner's Deck, my favorite new dining guide for New York City
Thanks to another fantastic brunch!
everything was fantastic
try the ginger pear martini, sweet and spicy
pork tenderloin is very tasty
green macaroni is actually a good variation on mac and cheese
go with a few friends so you can taste everything
:)
After a 40 minute wait for 2 people in the bitter cold this past Sunday, I was expecting a pretty phenomenal brunch from Good and they delivered! Although the wait was too long, the staff was cheerful, and the brunch was probably the best I've ever had
We had the daily specials - chocolate donuts and avocado/shrimp/chive omelets
The food made it definitely worth the wait
Good has an excellent brunch
Get the corn arepas with fried eggs and queso blanco
So delicious
but only if you like your eggs runny because that's how they're supposed to be for this dish
The jalapeno and cheese grits were delicious as well, and the staff super friendly
went for a late dinner a few saturdays ago and the four of us really enjoyed the amazing food (try the pulled pork!), drinks (watermelon martinis) and unhurried atmosphere
make sure you save room for the banana chocolate chip bread pudding- one of the best desserts ive ever had!! cant wait to impress others with this spot
Great place, this is my favorite moderate price restaurant in the south chelsea north west village area
Probably eat here 5x per month
Relaxed,
attentive staff, great food
My fiance and I went to Good this year for Thanksgiving and we were so impressed
The food was amazing, the drinks were unusual and definitely did the trick (butterscotch martinis!), and the service was friendly and laid back
The best part was that their seatings were scheduled 2 hours apart, so there was plenty of time to enjoy our fabulous 4 course meal
Pricey, but so worth it
We just moved into the neighborhood and decided to check Good out
Our reservation got screwed up but the manager swiftly bought us a round of drinks, righted the situation and we were seated and having a fantastic dinner (burgers are AMAZING) after only a minor delay
We'll definitely return
We stopped in here late Saturday night and had an unexpected excellent meal
The tuna with collard greens and carrot pancakes is excellent and the green chili mac-n-cheese is a tasty twist on a comfort food staple
Try the watermelon martini (fresh watermelon juice) and the Lulo daquari
Our service was good, and even if it wasn't, the food would have made such a shortsight seem negligible
I enjoyed my jalapeno mac cheese

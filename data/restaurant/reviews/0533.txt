The lunch menu is exceptional value for money
We order from Ko at least once a week
The fish is some of the freshest I've had in the city and the rolls and pieces are created and cut to perfection
We prefer Ko to it's much hyped neighbor Poke
Also, Ko is reasonably priced for the quality of fish you are getting
I highly recommend the Hawiian Role
Dined there twice
Yes, it's a little slow, esp on weekend
But it wasn't as bad as the previous posters suggested
The place does have a little relaxed vibe going on
And very romantic for dates
The entrees are great
It's not pretencious kind of food
We have fried chicken strip and meatloaf, and they're the best I've had in NYC
I think most who came here wanted to taste the food, and were not in a hurry to catch a movie or something
I don't know why, but the bar area is always packed
Maybe they are regulars who come here just to drink with the owner / host? Will definitely go back
I love this restaurant
I have dined at Kurio, several times
The food is wonderful
Everything is made fresh daily
It has this downtown flare uptown
Check out the Green Bean Tempura and the Lamb Chops and do not forget to order the Truly Molten Chocolate Cake! Sometimes the food takes a little longer but it is well worth the wait
It is a great dining experience!
I couldn't believe what a horrible time we had
We sat down at 8:45, our order was taken at 9:20ish, and our appetizers didn't arrive until after 10
We asked why it was taking so long and the waiter showed us the fine print on the menu
Made from scratch - PUHLEEZ!!! Spare me! It would have taken me 3
5 minutes to make veal chops taste that bad
The only reason we got our appetizers when we did was because husband had threatened that we would leave
Needless to say, we left after our less than appetizing appetizers and cut our losses
My girlfriend and I dined their this past Valentine's day and it was great!!!! I live in the neighborhood and had always wanted to dine their but I guess I needed a special occasion
Red roses were everywhere
We had a tasting -- 4 courses- she had the pheasant and I had the lamb chops
It was perfect
The dessert was a double chocolate cheesecake for two -- delicious
They even offered a wine pairing
The service was great, ambience fabulous and the food wonderful
We were quite impressed
It is about time the upper east side has a place like this -- a gem !
What a Find!
From the moment I saw the odd name in Zagats with a killer rating to the warm personal greeting of the hands on owner when I walked through the door with my date
The fare is simple but clearly fresh and intensely prepared
The dining room is warm and quaint with a strangely quiet energy
The waiter was knowledgable about the menu and spirits, and guided me to all the right items to order given my budget and occasion
The owner kept a vigilant eye on all the tables and made a point of checking in with each and every guest from start to finish
Hands on is the way to go! I definately reccomend Kurio to anyone who wants to impress a date and not break the house bank in the process
Whew! finally some warmth in the upper east side
I have dined here several times and I disagree with the last two reviews
Yes, the food takes a little longer to prepare
But if you have dined there more than once, and not on a busy weekend night, then you would understand that everything is prepared from scratch and made fresh daily
I have never had a bad meal at Kurio
You have to try it to understand
It is a small and quaint spot that does not sit more than 30 people
Since the write up in Zagats it been hard to just walk in on weekends
There are always flowers and I am told by all of my dates that the woman's bathroom is fabulous
Take someone's word who has dined there several times
Kurio is a piece of downtown uptown
Just remember it is a place to dine -- so relax and enjoy!
The food is terrible, the service slower than molasses
The Zagat gives them 25 rating for food
It must be a type-o
This is one horrible restaurant, long on aspiration very low on delivery Don't waste your evening!
There is something terribly wrong with this restaurant!  I planned a holiday dinner at Kurio and we ended up waiting two hours for the appetizers
The first bottle of red wine was served at a temperature of 75 degrees and after we complained, the second red was cooled in a bucket of ice water!!!  We waited one hour before even receiving the menus and the waitress/owner would get my attention by giving me a shove in the back from behind!!! This is no exaggeration!  This was a truly upsetting experience and I would advise EVERYONE to avoid this restaurant
Kurio is a hip, unpretentious and delicious slice of downtown uptown
A striking, somewhat exotic, hostess/owner tends the bar and tables along with her capable and friendly mother; her fiance and father bless the kitchen
It's an arrangement as unlikely but synergistic as the flavors of the food
Terrific, even sophisticated, delivered by smooth, capable, amiable service
My wife and I both agreed: the pumpkin ravioli in a lemon creme sauce (an appetizer) was the best ravioli we had tasted in some time
My wife's swordfish was cooked perfectly, accompanied by a flavorful, though not overbearing sauce
The shrimp I had, over and surrounding a bed of white rice, was excellent
Delicate, flavorful, and again, merely complemented by its partner sauce
Unlikely flavors coming together effortlessly
A really nice experience all around
And who would've thunk - on East 92nd street??
For a restaurant in the theater district, the service was surprisingly slow
Our food took so long to be served that we nearly missed our curtain
Repeated requests for the status of our order we're ignored and we were repeatedly told, 5 minutes or coming up
Needless to say, it took significantly more than 5 minutes for our order to be served
Kyma is amazingly spacious for a midtown restaurant, with high ceilings and an elegant, roomy feel
The food is fabulous -- delicious, creamy chicken soup, spectacular salads, great spanakopita, you name it
Best of all, there's an extremely reasonable prix fixe at lunch time -- and even at dinner prices aren't too steep
Service is also exemplary
Be sure to find your way to Kyma
I found about it when I went to the International Market on 9th Ave (right behind Port Authority)
They make the freshest Greek specialties
When I asked if their taramasalota was served in any Greek restuarant in NYC they told me about Kyma
The service is superb, the food, out of this world, and I recommend it to anyone who loves Greek food
Kyma is owned by the same owners of Ithaka in the Village
This is a great place to go for lunch or dinner for those who don't want to spend more than $15 on a drink and a meal
The sandwiches are divine, and the bread is obviously fresh
The setting is relaxing
(probably not for the very picky eater, but the staff is so nice that they will probably do what they can to help out
) A block from the Central Park 72nd St
entrance, and about 2 blocks from the subway
There is hardly a place better in this neighborhood for great coffee, light lunches, and a relaxing atmosphere
Very French!
Beautiful place to enjoy your coffee and a small lunch
The big, community table makes it easy to meet new people

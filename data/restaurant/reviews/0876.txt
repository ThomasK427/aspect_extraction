The menu always has something new to offer, and I am never disappointed
Just as good are the standards, you cant go wrong with the Steak Frites or the Fish Chips
Oh
and definitly save room for the sticky toffee pudding! Just a warning
it's a busy place, so come early and have a drink before you eat!
Schiller's has it all -- great food, drinks, prices, ambiance, service, and a lively crowd
I'd recommend the rotisserie chicken with a side of fries followed by the sticky toffee pudding, or try some of their fantastic fish specials
I once had a black bean soup there that I can describe only as a soup epiphany (haven't seen the soup on the menu since)
The funky bathroom itself is worth the price of admission! The only drawbacks are that it gets very loud so that you can only talk to adjacent people, and sometimes it gets so crowded that there's a bit of jostling for space between the bar patrons and the diners
Also, brunch is quite good but they don't serve alcohol before noon
We went there last night as walk-ins and were seated in under 50 min (not bad for Sat
)
The place is interestingly decorated and dimly lit w/old white tiles and yellow glowing flourescents
It's definitely crowded, loud, and people watching is a must
Drinks were good, but food was average
I had pork chops (a little dry/chewy) and she had the trout
Overall, both were fine, but not very interesting
Great place to go with a group of friends for the slick scene and drinks
love this new addition to the neighborhood
this place delivers, good food
This place is such a great value! The only bad things about is that if you get the wrong table you have a lot of people sort of standing around you while eating but just request a table in the back to diminish that
I had the grilled chicken with salad and it was really good as was the Decent red wine
Very trendy, lively atmosphere and can't beat the price
After many rave reviews, I decided to go to schillers for dinner with two friends
We made a reservation for 9 and got there at 8:30 to sit at the bar
There were no seats at the bar, it was too crowded to stand near it because of the location of chairs and several large parties
We were not seated until 10:15 and the food which came quickly was overall disappointing, uninteresting and not good
Great value in a convenient location, stellar service and excellent food
This is a great place to dine alone on those fun and adventurous Manhattan excursions to the lower east side!
We went there a few weeks ago with a party of three
We waited almost 2 hours to be seated for our 9:00 reservation
After repeately checking with the hostess and manager we were finally seated after 11
The place was so crowded that you could not move
The food was awful and like the other review we had butts in our faces and drinks on our head while we were eating
Maybe they were having an off night -- but we all agreed never to go back
This restaurant is fantastic
The food is delicious and the hipster crowd is fun (not snobby)
I particularly like the way they serve wine by carafe - you have to choose between ordering cheap moderate or expensive
The service is fun and friendly, and the atmosphere is great
My only gripe is that you really have to call 1 week in advance to secure a decent reservation -- but once you get there -- you'll see why
I went there for a fun business dinner and was not disappointed
Drinks at the bar were great
We ordered a shrimp appetizer that was fantastic
The cesar salad and hamburgers my companions ordered were huge
I ordered the salmon and it was delicious with a great texture
For 4 people with several drinks, bottles of wine, appetizers and entrees, the price tag was $170 before the tip
every dish intensely flavored left us speechless for a while
don't leave without trying the delicious ginger martinies and the succulent lamb shank
Schiller's has a cute bistro feel with some excellent food
Definitely go for the steak frites - signature dish that doesn't disappoint
We got some sangria and it was pretty good too
If you want good food in a young, casual setting without breaking the bank, this is the place to go
I have been here twice and both times ordered the Schiller's special steak fritters! Loved it in medium rare and pepper sauce
would not order anything else:-) Excellent wine selections
Ambiance
cant beat it
(my friend said it reminded him on London!) they might want to reduce the music volume so we can hear each other talking though
Otherwise
thumbs up!
While you will sit in very close quarters with your neighbors, we found the food to be very good and service to be VERY quick and efficient
Got everything we wanted out of the experience
The atmosphere is terrible too bright too loud
The chairs are very uncomfortable
We were seated inches from the bar and had to contend with people standing all around us waiting for a table
The food was terrible
I had the french onion soup which tasted like it had a cup of sugar in it
Why everyone flocks to this place I will never understand, there are so many better restaurants in the city
Schiller's is a quintessential restaurant--great for brunch, lovely for dinner
The eggs benedict are wonderful, as well as the homemade doughnuts
I went to dinner with a large group of friends; we had a wonderful time sharing fries, burgers, and eggplant parmesan (which, by the way, are a bit on the spicy side)
Don't miss out on an order of fries, and make sure to get plenty bottles of wine!
Schiller's in East Village has something warm in its design that invites each person in and makes them feel comfortable once inside
A more laid back approach than it's big brother Balthazar (though still with the same great fries and bread!), the prices are cheaper and the food is still great
The decor is 50s-ish, and think it works best as a lunch place
The bathroom, for what it's worth, was also very cool! Recommend Schillers for lunch, definitely, the food, price and decor are all highlights
On my third visit, on Sat night around 9, the maitre'd recognized me, welcomed me, told us there'd be about a 30-45 minute wait for a table for 3
He was right, but still apologized for the delay and brought us a round of comp froz marg's at our table just to be NICE
Dig that
Food was top-notch, I LOVE the decent red wine, and I had the KICKIN steak frites for the 3rd time
(Ignore the post below -- written by an employee from down the street, perhaps?) The crowd was stylin but not trying too hard, it's still L
E
S
come as you are, a touch on the young side for my taste, but that's fine
(It *was* a Sat nite
) It's absolutely worth the trip to the L
E
S
, for the food alone
The tight-packed bar guarantees some easy mingling and name-trading -- they were flirty and friendly
I am a huge fan of Mcnally
I have been to all of his restaraunts , had great steak frites
I went to Schiller last saturday at 6pm, right when they open, b/c i knew that was my only option if i wanted to eat before midnight
The snotty hostess wouldnt give us a good table,eventhough the entire place was empty
we realized that the menu changed and they took the GOOD steak off and replaced it with a Hangar steak that was absolutely horrible
It was marinated in some terrible tasting garlic flavor, that didnt mix well with any of the sauces, and was tougher then a leather shoe
I thought I could stop going to LES HALLES for a good steak craving, but I dont want to pay 2$ more for a leather steak when i can go right up the street for authentic and tender
We went to Schiller's and had a wonderful time
The servise was fantastic
Was very knowledgeable of the menu, had great recommendations
Service was fast and accomodating - let us sit at requested table

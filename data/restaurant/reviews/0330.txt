Unfortunately, it did not
First of all, the steak is clearly not as good at MarkJoseph
I have heard that the buyer from Peter Luger gets special treatment at the meat market every morning and usually gets the best meat in town that day
In addition to being inferior quality, my steak at MarkJoseph was completely undercooked
We ordered it medium and it came out purple
The one bright spot is the seafood platter
Excellent calamari, in particular
The service at MarkJoseph is decent but determined to seat you at exactly your reservation time and then they rush you out the door
It's noticeable
By the time you get down to Water Street, you might as just go to Luger's
So it seems like the comparison is between MarkJoseph's and Peter Lug
So I've been to both restaurants about a half dozen times
Mark Joseph's comes out on top
First of all, the service
I'm a regular working guy who likes steak
When I go to P
L
, maybe because I'm not Tony Soprano, the service is patronizing and condescending
Don't need the attitude, just a steak
Also, the side dishes at P
L
are very inconsistent
For instance, sometimes the spinach is creamy and tasty, sometimes it tastes like goop
At Mark Joseph's, the side dishs are consistently solid
Now the steak
P
L has good steak, MJ has good steak
Pretty much the same damn steak
can't tell the difference
So between the friendly service and the better menu overall, I've got to recommend MJ
MarkJoseph's has definitely taken over as the best of the best in steak houses
The hot seafood platter almost outshines the finest steaks in New York
but, only almost
Try the special MJ Salad
another winner
UNBEATABLE service from JB and his hand picked crew
Zagat's was right-on in that department
I've eaten in all the well know steak joints in NY
This place was disappointing
The staek was not on par with the likes of Sparks, Peter Lugars, Bobby Van's, etc
Perfectly ccoked steaks, great potatoes, creamed spinach, etc
EVERYHTING I'm looking for in a classic steakhouse!
We chose to go here as a starter for my bachelor party
I couldn't have asked my friends for a better choice
The food was simply great as was the friendly, down-to-earth waiter who was eager to help us with our choices, both food wine
Highly recommended!
I had done some heavy research on choosing a steakhouse to take out of town guests
This was the wrong choice
The service was poor, the steak was tough, and nothing was exceptional
We didn't get food poisoning or anything, but I was really looking forward to the meal
Do yourself a favor and avoid this place
I think you have to know someone who works there to have a decent meal
It's one thing if you don't spend a lot of money for a meal, but when you pay top dollar, it is like putting salt in your open wound
OK, I've never been to Luger's
But I can't imagine it's much better than this
Incredible, incredible steak--the porterhouse for four is unbelievably juicy and succulent
Sides are really great too
And you can get a table without too much difficulty
The Scene Larger-than-life prints of hillside grasses on the walls lend the space a clean, stylish air--think a Williams-Sonoma in full spring flower
Out front, a sidewalk cafe invites diners to watch the Soho traffic--both human and automotive--flit by
The Food The New American menu is as much about comfort as it is creativity
Meals generally begin in a pub-food vein, with appetizers like featherweight, perfectly salted fried clams and brown sugar-lacquered ribs that are good enough to take on any barbecue joint in the city
Entrees stake out more ambitious territory--honey-flecked pork over mascarpone polenta or halibut with a chilled salad of bulghur wheat and mint
Desserts such as vanilla cheesecake or a purse of warmed apples with caramel are simple and undeniably good
the space is roomy, but you never feel lost in the crowd
the result of very accomodating service
this and the food is what keeps bringing me back
i have tried numerous items on the menu and have never been dissapointed
i cant wait to go back
This place was a find in every way! Great food, service, ambiance! I will keep going back - and bringing friends - with prices like those, I can even afford to treat!
I can't remember the first time i went to Jane, but i can remeber the last--yesterday, and the next--tonight
My family and I have been coming to Jane for 5 years
It is our go to for dinners out when we want really good, upscale food at not upscale prices
Favorite dishes: chopped salad--a must--dill in the salad makes all the difference
Salmon tartar as an app is my husbands fav
The gnocchi is unbelievable when you feel like a little indulgence--definitely worh getting it for the table if only to taste
Flatbreads are wonderful too-goat cheese and carmelized onions--you cant get better
The fish are wonderful mains, as is the Jane Burger and the short ribs
Dessert highlights--milk and cookies--warm, soft chocolaty cookies and cold milk with a scoop if vanilla in the milk--I mean what could be better
The staff is wonderful from the host(ess)s, the the waiters and the bus boys
Everytime is such a treat
We've been there on all occasions-- random tuesdays to birthdays and new years
Jane has yet to disappoint
I obviously can't recommend it highly enough
I had not been to Jane in a while and returned to find it better than ever, although I was dissapointed to find that the city will no longer allow their sidewalk cafe
The staff and management are so friendly and really seem to try to make sure everyone has a good time
I had a steak with au poive sauce that was delicious for only $12! jane is a rare gem in this city: a friendly neighborhood place with great food at reasonable prices
Since 2002 I went to this restaurant at least 20 times
I have not visited in some months and when I returned for dinner yesterday I was shocked to find that I was treated extremely rudely by the host, he ruined our dinner and the mood
Suffise it to say that this will be my last dinner at that place, they will not stay in business much longer if they keep treating patrons like this
I agree with the other reviewers that the portions have decreased in size and the food is mediocre at best, the decor is showing it's age, wear and tear on the walls and the seating areas, the music is too loud for the conversation, the AC was not on in 80 degree weather and they did not have outside seating on hot April evening when all other restaurants had outside tables set up
Just awful
Went to lunch/brunch here with the girls on Saturday at noon
Although the place was hopping, the food was mediocre for the higher prices
The ambience is very average, kahki walls and oversized outdoorsy prints
Not a place worth finding and bringing friends to


New York is filled with better priced places with much more character
drinks were good

Other dishes are great too
Try their fried softshell crabs, cheaper than other places but the taste is never second here
Ever time I go to NYC, I will always have to stop by this place
It is one of my must-do in New York
The service is great too
They try to seat you as soon as possible
Don't let other big chinese restuarant rip you off
I've eaten here many a time
The food, while a bit greasy at times, is delectable
After sampling other Shanghai restaurants, including Joe's Shanghai, I find that this place's prices, service, and food outrank that of any other
The Shaw Lon Pau here is cheap and scrumptious
The decor is simple but homey
The place is small, so don't be surprise by a 5-10 minute wait
However, most patrons get takeout so don't be scared off by a crowd in front
But it is never so busy that you need reservations
Because of the size of the place, I don't recommend groups larger than 8, as seating might become a problem
There are many wonderful Shanghai style restaurants in Manhattan, but what makes them excellent is when they can make their shao lung bao dumplings just right so that it's not too chewy, not too soggy, and has the right amount of juice in it to tickle one's palate
Shanghai Garden is a family style restaurant in Chinatown where one must go to experience the flavorful juices which squirt out from their shao lung bao dumplings when one bites into it
There are lots of Chinese restaurants in the city, but not many that specialize in Shanghai style cooking
Of those which do, I like Shanghai Garden the most because the food is great and the prices are low so you can afford to go there when you're hungry to grab a quick snack without bleeding your wallet dry
In Short This trendy Thai restaurant is one of a handful in town offering cheap eats in a sleek, mod setting
Popular with a young and hungry NYU crowd, inexpensive curries come in all colors and heats with a choice of chicken, beef, tofu, shrimp or veggies
Other house specialties include whole grilled fish with tamarind sauce and crispy duck with mushroom and pineapple
Went to Spice Restaurant for dinner and loved my meal
It was a vegetable curry flavored noodle dish which was very good
Also, for desert I had the fried banana and vanilla icecream dish
Both scrumptious
The waitress was perfect and very friendly despite the hub bub that surrounded us
The only thing is that the bus boy hovered, it felt, while we ate because he wanted us to get in, consume the food, and be on our way
Granted there was a wait but it's hard to enjoy food, let alone begin the digestion process, if you know you will be booted out the door
Booted may be strong but you get the picture
Despite this, I would recommend the restaurant because the food is worth it
Spice is great Thai food, love the inexpensive appetizers
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes
Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating
Its worth the wait though
All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere
I have been to spice three times- twice during lunch and once at dinner
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu
I love this place
The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down, rushing you out
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch- I dont mind
The place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently
Great food at reasonable prices
For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings
It's usually packed for good reason, esp
at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles' heel
My co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery, only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered
However, their popularity has yet to slow down, and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation
and so cheap! I crave it and have been to all three locations countless times
A friend and I decided to spend our one hour lunch break at Spice
My friend has been there many times and was eager to introduce me to her favorite Thai restaurant
Upon arrival the hostess chatted on the phone and didn't even make eye contact with me to at least acknowledge that I was there
After about 5 minutes, a man I would presume to be the manager comes out, takes out names and says that we would be next on the list
My friend and I waited
Gasped in disgust when a party of two AND THEN party of three was seated a head of us
Then we waited some more
The food was decent, the atmosphere loud and trendy, and the staff completely oblivious
Not a great experience
Spice is sleek, modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the food was slightly disappointing
The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places
You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting
You have to love Spice
Great thai food and very inexpensive
Tough to get space with a large group and very loud
Great for a quick meal
Don't expect to sit here for a couple hours and relax
If you want quick, great thai food - this is the place
I waited two hours for my food and still did not receive it
The hostess was not apologetic, and I would still have had to pay
I just moved to NY from LA and this place was super COOL
Awesome lego wall, bulb chandelier, and retro chairs not to mention the awesome DJ selection playing over head made this place one I'll return to
Highly recommended
I went here for lunch and got their lunch special
It was great - everything was delicious and fresh
For about 7 (including tax), I got a decent sized serving of an entree, an appetizer, and rice
Portions of the entree were not huge, but were certainly large enough to be considered a good value
Also, they gave me a full pint of rice with the meal, which I couldn't finish, having already eaten the 4 delicious vegetable dumplings and the excellent chicken with ginger and pineapple stirfry
I did takeout, so I can really say that much about the service - although my meal was probably ready in 5-10 minutes - pretty speedy, and the staff seemed nice
Will definitely eat here again for lunch and maybe for dinner (the prices for dinner are reasonable too)
The Spice on 8th Ave (not sure about this location) offers a lunch special that for 6
50 you get an entree and an appetizer
The service is always fast and the food is always delicious
Good for dinner too! Fast Delivery
I love this place
Not only is the food amazing, but for the price and the decor, you're totally getting a bargain
The creative menu has so much to choose from, and you can't help but want to go back over and over again
i LOOOVE this place
I live right around the corner, and i eat there at least once a week
The service is phenomenal and the waiters are very nice
The pad thai is excellent here and pretty cheap for the meal that you're getting
Its a really hot spot right now, its always packed and a lot of hipsters go here--- so it makes for a fun atmosphere
I would recommend the spice caesar salad for an appetizer
DELISH!
Spice is definently one of my favorite places to eat
I've had every appetizer on the menu and the martini shrimp should not be missed

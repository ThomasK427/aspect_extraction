Fusion is one thing
throwing flavors together that aren't in sync with one another leads to disaster
A friend and I arrived on a Wednesday night
The place was empty except for one table, but they were just having drinks (red flag #1)
We started with the kaffir lime meatballs, which took 20 minutes to arrive
They tiny fried meatballs ere still bloody, just plain uninspired and gross
The black bean lasagna looked like canned cat food dumped into a bowl, and the braised squid over couscous? HA! It somehow pooled together seriously disgusing flavors into one dish
The squid was very old--growing up on the stuff, I know it should be tender yet firm to the tooth, but this stuff was dry and scarily chewy
And the tomato sauce tasted like spaghetti-o's sauce--syrupy and cloyingly sweet
A solid restaurant with CONSISTENT food is the mark of success
If you know an exotic dessert lover who wants to be transformed to another place take them to Monkey Town
The main courses were exotic, casual and fine but the desserts
culinary heaven
We tried two - both amazing - the Chocolate Curry mouse with a caramel center wallows in your happy spicy thoughts for days to come
The other was like a pistachio crust cheesecake??? with a pomegranite sauce
Not describing the ingredients well but to kill for
Desserts here are a ritualualist spiritual or sensual adventure you must return back to
Leela Lounge on 1 West, 3rd Street, just off Broadway is on of my favourite haunts lately
Discovered by a few friends one lazy evening
we walked into a warm welcoming home away from home
the place is done up beautifully in a golden orange hue with amazing intricate and detailed artwork on its walls, huge mirrors to enhance the warmth exuded by its host and athe place itself
The food is simply too delicious, one has to go and taste it
Though an Indian Restuarant, the menu caters to the taste buds of people from any part of the globe
believe me! Its the place to Lounge and enjoy a few drinks and then make your way to a hearty meal
yummy!
Totally unique, upscale Indian at affordable prices
What a find
Great bar, atmosphere and service
Chef makes and creates fresh matching chutney sauces for each dish
Try all of them
Love the lamb in particular
This place has it all, nice place to eat and hang out over the weekend
Good mixed crowd, good food and service
This place is a real gem, and I cannot believe it took me this long to find it
I had to check it out after reading reviews here
We had samosa and chicken leelapops for appetizer, and chicken tikka and tandoori vegetables with paneer for entrees
I cannot believe non-potato samosas can be this good! They added mushrooms and peas
Chicken Leelapops were spicy and yummy - the best! The chick was very very soft, and this is the first Indian restaurant where I felt that chicken was well-cooked
The entrees were equally good, and healthy - no cream, and less oil
The total alongwith a bread basket came upto $50 - a steal in NY
By the way, entrees are served with dal/lentils and rice
I celebrated my 21st birthday at Leela Lounge and i would highly recommend it for parties
It is a gorgeous space, the food is delicious, the staff is extremely friendly, and the drinks are well priced
We had a great time drinking mangotinis, eating samosas, and getting henna tattoos!
the lunch here is very good and worth the money
one can enjoy this place at night with a big group or a date
First of all I have to say, the food was wonderful
Samosas are amazing! BUT there were some really strange things that happened while my friends and I were dining there for my birthday
My friend ordered Lamb Korma, and was told by the waiter, You don't want that, try
instead
My friend ended up getting the korma anyway, and loved it
The same thing happened when we tried to order appetizers
we were told to get something else, and had to argue with the waiter to get what we wanted
VERY STRANGE
It took forever to get our bill when we asked for it, even though the place was pretty empty
and they tacked on an auto 20% gratuity for 5 people (we asked them to take it off)
All of this being told what to do, and having to argue for what we wanted did not make for a relaxing dining experience
Well they're right about being able to eat the desserts your going to want to try them all
Don't miss the Baily's dessert or the Creme Brulee
I tried the tilapia dish done with just enough coconut flavor to complement but not hide the flavor of the fish
you'll scoop up every last bit of the sauce
The atmosphere is chill with good music
The bar area is spacious with a few tables where you can hang with friends and sip a Leechee martini and share a few apps
Definitely the next hot spot in that neighborhood which, until now, had nothing going on as far as a cool night-time spot
Great place for a big group
Check it out!
II went to Leela Lounge last night and had a terrific experience
The ambiance is immediately soothing and sensual, and the staff extremely friendly
The best part, of course, was the meal
We had the tilapia and lamb; both dishes had delicate yet bold flavors
The nan (try the garlic) was really light- we ate the entire bread basket!  Also really love the presentation of the food-each meal comes with rice, daal, and a side salad
And for dessert? Could I be happier with a dessert that has Gluco Biscuits? In fact, they are all fabulous
Best Indian food I have eaten in town, and I have tried them all
Loved the place! Very interesting (and tasty) variations of Indian food entrees, solicitous and knowledgeable staff, and, yum and different desserts
The chicken  drumsticks (appetizer) is superb and do do ask the chef or the staff for dessert reccomendations
The space is great and the bar - generous! :) Must try (AND you'll go again! )
On my first visit to Leela Lounge I was surprised at how comfortable and romantic the place was
Everyone was extremely friendly, the lounge area has great snacks and fantastic drinks with a very social atmosphere, and the restaurant has some of the best and freshest Indian/Asian food around
The prices were reasonable and the service very prompt
I have been back several times with various friends and they have all loved it
My suggestion is to get there before it becomes too popular
I am now a regular
The interior was very pleasing
Romantic, wonderful food resonably priced
A mix of trendy and traditional
A must have experience
I was surprised to learn that Leela culinary staff does not use any butter or heavy cream in any of their cooking
In fact, I was surprised to learn about the use of Olive oil in some of the preparations
We just hosted a baby shower for my sister at Alice's Tea Cup
What a wonderful location
The staff was fantastic, the food was terrific and the room was great (a little snug for 27)
The atmosphere is whimsical
Our waitress and all the staff were very attentive
They squeezed around our guests and the plethora of gifts without complaint
The Mad Hatter tea service with scones and tea sandwiches was delicious
Desserts also come with the service, but I was so full I didn't have any
We added on mimosas - very good, but pricey - it is NY
We received so many compliments on the shower, most on our location
Many of the New Yorkers said they would be going back
Next time we visit NY I would love to go back as well

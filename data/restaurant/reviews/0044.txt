The food and service was average
I would not return
Came highly recommended from a native New Yorker
we're so glad that we went! Very good food, nice staff, beautifully simple and elegant decor, and wonderful dining experience
We went at lunch and loved it-  Overall, an excellent Italian restaurant that is not too expensive!
This is the sister restaurant of Mario Pia up near the theatre district and it's almost exactly the same
Decor is simple yet functional and although the staff are not the most attentive in the world, you don't feel rushed and the food is good, hot with decent portion sizes and a good selection to suit most tastes
They even managed to do take out too
Find a 'Where' or 'In' magazine and cut out the coupon for a free bottle of wine - makes for a very cheap meal out
See, I usually don't pay much attention when people say the waitstaff are obnoxious and whatnot, but this time they are right
The food here, undeniably, is amazing for the west side
The goat cheese and sun dried tomato ravioli is great, the bread may be a little weak, but the calamari is nice
However, the people working at this restaurant seem to hate themselves and the diners as well
I asked for a coke, like a soda, and it took my waitress five minutes to understand what the hell I was talking about
She was actually angry with me or something, I never said anything to her, I said please and stuff, but she was off the bat completely rude
Same thing with the other people that brought me stuff
Great food, but try to ignore the people working there, because they are going to ignore you
WIthout doubt, the worst service I have ever experienced
Our waitress had no clue about the menu and (after we had ordered a bottle of wine) told us the kitchen was closing and stood guard until we ordered
Our tepid appetizers arrived faster than a Big Mac and our main course before we had half finished our apps
Then the staff began to drag tables around the floor, slam the shutters next to our window and place every chair on the tables around us
Then followed a long staring match by the entire staff (who had largely changed from their uniforms) until one employee apologized for the 'rushed' treatment
The manager refused to speak to us and, needless to say, we were not offered dessert or coffee, just the bill
A terrible restaurant - go anywhere else
Simple but great decor, good and inexpensive food, pretty friendly staff!
Puttanesca is one of the best italian retaurants in nyc
We have been eating i n nyc for 49 yrs and finding this food and service is like a gift
Most restaurants in nyc are just ok and expensive
But Puttanesca has food that is so good you can;t stop thinking about when your going back
The prices are so inexpensive I wonder how they make money
The ambience is like sitting in a painting of beauty, such artistic design like a David Hockney painting
The service is so polite
Very noisy because it is so crowded
But you get use to the crowds because your having so much fun
I strongly urge reservations
So hurry you wont be sorry
Try the blk fettucine with the lobster or the cioppino
You will love it
I never write reviews, but I consider this one to be a public-service
The host was rude
Yes, there are many waiters per customer, but what does it matter when they give you attitude every time you ask for something? The fresh mozzerella appetizer had to be the runniest mozz I have ever had, and the accompanying tomato was so over-salted I could barely eat it
I ordered the pepper-encrusted tuna
He said they didn't have tuna, so I ordered the blackened sea bass
I received the tuna
Or should I say slight-tuna-filled-pepper
It was so overseasoned (as was the salad beneath it) that I had to stop halfway through the entree just to blow my nose
To top it all off, this place takes only AmEx, and they snicker when they have to inform you of that fact
Try any of the 3 other Italian places on this corner
Loving Patsy's down the block, but not loving the prices, decided to saunter over to 56th/9th- 3 Italian restaurants at the intersection
Could not believe two were empty (Saturday night at 6:30) Puttanesca was packed
My PO5 was seated promtly (w/o reservation) and treated to an amazing dinner
There is no waiting area, so we had a crowd hovering over our table, this is just testament to how many people want to eat there
Fresh pasta was a little too soft- not unexpected on a weekend evening rush, the standard pasta was perfect
What I liked the most is that the staff listened attentively to what I asked for and my meal was prepared EXACTLY the way I asked, what a treat
My last suprise was the bill, 5people, 4apps, 6entrees(3 specials) +wine and it came out to less than $150!!!! Now I know why the other restaurants were empty
THIS RESTAURANT BY FAR HAS CHANGED HELL KITCHEN 56 ST
THE FOOD AND SERVICE IS BETTER THEN MOST RESTAURANTS, THE PRICE IS LIKE EATING FOR FREE
THE QUALITY IS FOR THE MOST PART 100 %
THE RESTAURANT DOES GET CROWDED VERY CROWDED ON WEEKENDS BECAUSE IT IS SO WELL KNOWN
Early bird diners will find it to be more relaxed and less noisy, The waiters,managers
owners will give the shirt off there back to make you happy
I know because I dine there many of times maybe 200 times
Im the owner of a mercedes dealership on the west side and these guys always treat me my family and clients with great respect
I would recomend this place as a palce you will love to know and always will return year in and year out with everyone you know
What a find
This was hands down one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had
Do not eat at this restaurant
We did not receive what we ordered, the food was cold, and the manager was extremely rude and arrogant
He did not even know his own menu, nor the prices of his food, and had the audacity to ask what my problem was when the check was wrong
I have visited many of the N ew York City Restaurant Restaurants and have always had a pleasurable experience
The food is wonderful and reasonably priced, (so hard to find in NY) and the wait staff is very attentive and helpful when choosing an entree
I was suprised to read the disfavorable review left about Puttanesca
I highly reccomend visiting and seeing for yourself!
If there were no seats at any other location in midtown, then this will do as a last resort
Don't be fooled by the crowded dining room
The room is filled with out-of-towners who would likely not return
The man alleging to be the owner couldn't be more rude or disinterested in your dining experience
Save yourself the frustration and dine across the street!
puttanesca has great service with such flare and all the waiters are so happy your there
not to say the food is just wonderful,you must try puttanesca for its a great find
This is an absolutely great restaurant! The service is outstanding
Not only did I have one waiter but it was like I had four
Anything we needed they were right there for you
The food was wonderful and the desserts are even better
Highly recommended and will return!!!
this puttanesca deserves awards to be able to make the food and service with these prices is a miracle
Don;t forget the beautiful room they designed
you feel like you in a very expensive restaurant until you get the bill
The food taste so good i can;t wait to starve myself so i can return to eat more of there fantastic pastas try the cioopino
well we chose puttanesca just walking down the street,after seeing the boats
What a great surprise perfect pasta and fun time
Try the clams with pasta it tatse perfect
Next time we come to the city we will return and we will tell our friends
Puttanesca has a great price-to-gourmet ratio
The patio atmosphere is cozy and verdent, good for a date
Pastas and their sauces are rich
The gnocchi was especially good
The waiters are good but they seem overtaxed most times I've been there
The Scene Unpolished but cozy, with red walls, arty sconces and deep, comfortable booths, Raga calls little attention to itself
There's a downstairs room for parties or busy nights

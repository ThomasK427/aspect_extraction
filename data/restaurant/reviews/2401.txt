They are also very accomidating -- for example; when ordering the Chirasi they ask if there is anything you don't like, and then substitute with something that you do like! Prices are reasonable compared to others with comparable quality
Service is prompt and friendly
I highly recommend this place!
The service was great
Small place
Great food
Very good tempura
Very good atmosphere
I eat all over the united states and this is now one of my favorites
I just took a friend to dinner for his birthday at the Steakhouse at the Monkey Bar
It was my first and last visit
You may as well just extend the bar into the restaurant since it has already penetrated it with loud music, loud voices, and a remarkable amount of cigarette smoke
Further, the inattention and incompetence of the staff would be less apparent in a dimly lit bar where guessing at which of two people gets every item would not be inexcusable
Nor would people notice the number of things falling on the floor, the long disappearances of the staff, or the other members of the staff in suits who ignore the diners as they talk loudly about repairing the dishwasher or just walk in and around the restaurant
Good food - almost as good as its sister restaurant The Strip House
However, the service is terrible and it ruins the experience
There are too many good steak houses in the city to waste your time and money here
I went here for lunch the other day
The food was actually pretty good, though perhaps not quite as it should be for the price
The setting is intesting and the installations are cool
The main problem was the service, the waiter first brought us the orders for a different table (they looked good though) and it took them forever to check in on us again
With some more staff this might be a decent lunch option, I can't comment on the bar scene here
is best to go here
for the price the food was just ok
quite crowded/noisy/cramped
svc was not very good or attentive - they definitely need more wait staff - not a very good experience
SUM IT: if you must go tag along on someone else's tab
bar scene if you like to be squeezed in wait to be serve
A guest from Montana wanted to get a NY Strip Steak while she was here, and New York magazine wrote up Monkey Bar as a good place
We were unimpressed by both the treatment and quality of the beef
She had her NY Strip, while I chose the filet mignon, medium rare
What i received was of a very generous size, but lacked any pink within and was very dry
A third party at our table also had the mignon, ordered medium, and received charred
the sides were passable, but not as large as implied
the waiters were condescending
The Montanan enjoyed her strip, but responded no more enthusiastically than at Outback
Both of us prefer the steaks we've had grilled by a rancher at the ranch
what you order is what you get--not even a leaf of lettuce comes with the steak
A very comptetent bar
the staff are always polite and pleasant, the ambience excellent, a good selection of wines and beers
I normally eat at the attached restaurant rather than the bar, but the odd bite i've had has been very competent
Overall recommended
Not only are the bartenders great to look at they are also friendly and extremely skilled
I have to say this is the best bar I have found yet in manhattan
Like eating at the zoo
A packed bar and snotty clientele can literally ruin your night at the otherwise fine Monkey Bar
Menu is tasty but not spectacular
The Scene Nestled in the heart of the Upper East Side, Serendipity 3 could hardly be in a snugger, safer or more mainstream spot
The clean white walls, complemented by Tiffany-style lighting, create a welcoming, easygoing warmth
The Food The restaurant is primarily a dessert spot, but the food--which is served in portions as generous as the desserts--is simple and tasty, from soups, salads, crepes and pasta to hot dogs and burgers
Nonetheless, the real star remains dessert--sublime, sinful and massive
Aficionados swear by the frozen hot chocolate, made from no fewer than 14 kinds of chocolate ground into a rich slush
Linger over a root beer float or watch your banana split melt into milky oblivion--your kids will be blissed out in creamy sweet abandon
Serendipity is always a ridiculous long wait
I would not recommend going there for dinner
If you can, try to make the lunch hours or else you'll be crammed with a bunch of tourists on a snowy manhattan day
Or even worse; a hot and sunny manhattan day
However, the restaurant has a lot of charm, unless you get seated next to the angry people on line
I can guarantee that would make it an awkward dinner
If you don't get seated upstairs or towards the inner part of the restaurant, I would say to just leave
I go there purely for its ambiance and how close it is to central park
The desserts are good and I don't think they're overrated
The strawberry sundae is heavenly
Bring a mate though because I find I can never finish a dessert by myself
The dessert prices and overall prices are reasonable
For food, I would recommend the meat loaf
This is also a very kid friendly place so bring the whole family
The service is average but the frozzen hot chocolate is definately a cut above
Enjoy
I am not sure why this place is so highly regarded because it is certainly not worth it
We knew about the long wait (2-3 hrs) so we put our name on the list and then went for dinner
Even then, we waited for at least 1 hr after our 1
5 hr long dinner elsewhere before being seated
Then, as others have pointed out, once upstairs, there were at least 3-4 tables empty
Must be a NY thing to have long lines to build anticipation
Anyways, all this would have been worth it had the desserts been what all the hype says they are
They are not
They are just a big mush of a whole lot of sugar, ice cream, and cream
If you have an incredibly sweet tooth, then maybe this is your thing, but it lacked any of the subtle richness and pleasure that a good crafted dessert should have
Seriously, a spoonful of sugar, cocoa powder, and crushed ice would be as good as the frozen hot chocolate
There are so many nicer quaint places in the city to enjoy incredible desserts and coffee without the wait that everyone in our group was left scratching their heads as to why this place is so famous
We had a party of 7 at 4:00 on a hot Saturday afternoon
We were there for dessert only
We were told there was a 90 minute wait, but to check back after 45 minutes to see if it might be moving quicker
We did - and were told there would be another 45 minute wait
The indoor waiting area was jam packed with people standing shoulder to shoulder so we waited outside
Since they only call your name once - and only inside, we had to keep going in and asking if they were getting closer to our name
The manager was very snippy and outright rude
By the time we were seated - after the full 90 minute wait - customers just arriving were being told of a 2 - 3 HOUR wait! Once seated at our talble we realized there were 32 empty seats at about 6 tables upstairs and several more downstairs
When we asked a waiter for an explanation of the long wait with some many empty tables he had no answer so we asked for the manager
When the manager arrived at our table it was explained to us that first of all, those tables are reserved and second of all, we only have one person bringing the food up and down the stairs
He was so rude that customers at surrounding tables actually dropped thier jaws in amazement
We had heard that the desserts were so huge you could share them with 2 or 3 people, which we planned to do
Until we were told there was an $8
50 minimum charge per person
The frozen hot chocolate was good - not certainly not worth all of this!!!
I always take my friends from out of town to Serendipity
The past few years were great
The hosts and the servers were always very friendly, helpful and accomodating
This past weekend, I had to take my uncle from Texas and a friend from Memphis and both times I had horrible service

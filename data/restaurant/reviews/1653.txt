Good date spot, too
Highly recommended, Pop is loungy good fun all around
the coolest place to go and chill at any time or any day
I loved the place
There's great seating - comfortable couches and chairs - and unobtrusive tables
The music was a bit loud for my tastes and could have been more varied, but no one else had a problem with it
The food is delicious
Especially their individual-sized pizza (which is still big enough for sharing)
The drinks are tasty as well
Also, they don't rush you, which is really nice when you simply want to lounge
Had an early meal there prior to a show, and the 4 of us were amazed at how terrific each item we were served tasted and was presented
Everything from the appetizers to the salads to the entrees was simply superb
Highly recommend this spot for great food at a suprisingly decent price
Staff was friendly in their garage mechanic jumpsuits, and the atmosphere was cool but not pretentious
I love this restaurant
It never disappoints
That's why it is a neighborhood favorite--it's so reliable
You can't go wrong here and it's moderately priced, to boot
(Not cheap--but a good value
) Nice ambiance
This is a fabulous classic Italian restaurant--no glitz and glamour, it's an older crowd--but delicious food, excellent service, and low-key, quiet atmosphere
Everyone in our party raved about their food (fried zucchini appetizer is superb, veal, chicken in marsala sauce) and we definitely plan to return to this neighborhood gem
This is a lovely restaurant with wonderful people
Linda and Louis are both excellent hosts and have become good friends to me and my family
We celebrate many ocaisions there and have always had wonderful food and service
I can particularly recommend the fish dishes which are always excellent! We always start with fried zuchinni and calamari and which is the best in the city
Although the crowd tends to be more middle aged than just married, Paul Jimmy's has been a favorite of mine and my husband's ever since he took me there on our first date
He proposed there, and we had our rehearsal dinner there, and will be celebrating our first anniversary there
The egplant rolatini are standby, as are most of the veal dishes, always tasty
The Scene Dojo's perennially-packed sidewalk tables and spartan dining room are flush with the hustle and bustle of St
Mark's
Budgets beats aura, judging from the daily throngs of hungry students from nearby NYU
The plain but clean space formulates urbania's perfect school cafeteria
The Food In such inelegant surroundings, the healthy food menu isn't so much "new age spa" as vegetarian on a shoestring budget
Soy abounds, in all forms: as firm patties, pure squares of glistening tofu, and something called a hijiki patty--mixed tastily with shreds of seaweed, then fried
Where soy leaves off, yakitori, noodles, hummus, salmon and ginger-dressed salads fill the gaps
The chopstick salad--a pile of cold soba tucked underneath crisp leaves--is chock full of freshness, and the salmon/vegetable platter is tender if bland
Stick to the restaurant's strengths -- burgers taste like an afterthought
You get what you paid for
Cheap food
Fast
Quality reflects the price
But you cant beat the prices either, esp
in NYC
Good for a quick eat
I used to go here in HS, was a great place for good foor and cheap eats
That was a long time ago
Now, the food there is substandard
For example, the okonomiyaki which shouldn't be a difficult dish, was bad
Didn't like the noodles an dhow it was put together
Especially since this is St
Marks, and there are places that make it 10 times better for around a $1-2 more
Also, I've seen small rodents there, TWICE
The first time, I saw it was when I was actually inside the restaurant and leaving, and as I see the tables outside, I saw a rodent running around
The second time, I was across the street, and saw this couple with a rodent running around their feet, AGAIN! To see a small rodent run around TWICE in/around the same restaurant
oh come on, give me a break
That's just plain gross
But it's up to you
It's cheap and has variety, but they have rodents and I personally think they're dirty
(of course things could have changed in a year?)
I stopped here with some friends for a few beers during Happy Hour and found a table outside
After we were sitting, we were informed that you must order food to sit outside (there was no sign)
We had already eaten but we decided to order an appetizer for the table
The waitress then told us that we had to order $2
50 per person of food (we ordered about $1
50 per person, $1 short, and had already ordered $10-15 of drinks)
She brought the manager out who then talked on the phone with someone about it while staring at us like the matter needed discussion and it took about 25 minutes and asking 3 times to get the fourth drink we ordered
The waitress and manager were extrememly rude for NO reason and then had the gall to add a 20% tip to the bill because we wouldn't order food (which we did anyway)
It was CRAZY horrible and all we wanted was to hangout and spend lots of money on beer
The manager even told us not to return after we paid our bill
don't worry
The food is good and cheap, but does not make up at all for the bad service we got last night
I understand we all have bad days, but her attitude sucked, she was condescending and negative to the customers
I'm never coming here again that's for sure
This place has me addicted to the soy patties--it comes with a sweet carrot sauce on top
My non vegetarian friends have enjoyed both the beef the turkey burgers and we all love the cheap prices
Every once in awhile I'll getting a craving for the delicious peanut noodles and evertime I go here I have to take an order of them to go
Just don't order a the sangia--it's weak
My friend and I had a good, cheap meal at Dojo's East, but the paying the bill ruined the experience
The server at the bar gave us the wrong change, and when we asked her about it, she got incredibily defensive and started to yell at us
She insisted we must have put the bill somewhere
She left in the middle of the discussion and started to complain to the patrons at the bar about us
When we asked to see the manager, she loudly told him how we took five dollars and hid it somewhere
The manager was nicer, but not more helpful, he told us that he would call us if the register was over five dollars
He never did
All that fuss over five bucks! Cheap restaurant or not, I have never had an experience like that
What kind of restaurant hires and encourages people so abusive?
I am a true regular to Dojo East
The waiteress knows what to bring me every time
CHICKEN CUTLET DINNER! Homemade tasty breaded cutlet very light and crisp
tahini dressing to die for
I always bring a 1/2 pint home for $3, yummmm!  Service is fast getting food
You need to ask for your check
Place is known for it
Great place to spend a sunday reading a book or chatting with friends after your meal they don't bug you to leave
If you're picky about tofu, like I am, you won't be disappointed at the firm chunks floating in the rich, vegetable-laden miso soup here
Comes with warm, whole wheat pita bread -- a perfect, filling lunch for under $5, including tip!
This is a great quick place to eat
The service is average, the food arrives quick and it's scrumptuous
It isn't gourmet (duh!) but it's such a nice place to crash with old friends if you just want to eat somewhere ultra casual

Joe and Diane know many of the customers by name even when the place is full
Where to begin
It's not that I had a bad experieince at this restaurant, it's just that nothing about it sticks out
I'm writing this review because a friend of mine asked me how I liked it I couldn't remember
I had to actually go back walk inside look at a menu to remember this place
Then it hit me why I forgot about it--because it was boring
The atmosphere was unexciting, the food was typical edible at best the staff lacked enthusiasm
I was in here about 2 weeks ago a server spilled some sticky sauce on my purse
She said opps never apologized for ruining my bag
I talked to the owner he fakely apologized
He didn't comp me my meal, offer dessert or offer to pick up the bill to have my purse cleaned
It's not that I wanted something for free, it's just that a jesture to do so would be nice
As far as the food goes-it's average
Just your normal run of the mill asian restaurant trying to be unique trendy
It's not
Delicious, delicious and delicious food! You'll enjoy the best Korean/asian fusion food and some really unusual drinks
The place has the coolest owner and the sexiest chef and they treat everyone with a warm personal touch
I had a great time!
The atmosphere grabs you when you walk inside- sort of a cross between Auntie Mame's basement and the culinary equivalent of deco
The food is amazing, and has been varied every time I've gone
A new menu is coming in, so I guess there'll be new faves to try
The drink Soju itself is a wave- smooth as water but can overcome
It can be the perfect date place, lounge-y, or homey
If Soju was in Manhattan, it'd be cool; because it's in BKNY, it's cooler
Went here after a wonderful evening at Floyds
The server didn't know his menu, couldn't offer any recommendations was completely unattentive
The food was even worse
The yard bean entree was bland didn't satisfy my appetite
The soup came with the broth in a teapot, but the lid fell off the minute I poured it
The hot tea was horrible, so watered down I felt like I was drinking hot water
The only redeeming quality was the decor, which was lit by candles that glowed against red walls
This place is a sinking ship
Great alternative to your favorite other Asian restaurant that you may have tired of - Japanese, Thai, Chinese - because it incorporates many different flavors into its menu
Cozy and warm indoor atmosphere and quiet and tasteful outdoor area
Several varied sauces and seasonings come with every meal so it's easy to adjust the heat to your own personal preference
Unique drink menu
Very professional service - attentive, not over-bearing
Very tasty food
Good and fast service, short wiating time for food
Extremly good for the price
So my boyfriend I finally went to Soju after walking by it almost everyday
Boy were we sure glad we did
He ate the happy family I ate the shrimp (the server's suggestion)
The drinks were too easy to drink, the food was amazing and the service was friendly
Best part was the banana custard with coconut
I could eat 10 of them!
Went in on a whim last tuesday
The cute long brown haired waitress was helpful and recommended that I try the sojuitos
Having never tried soju before I was impressed
I then tried homemade dumplings the waitress brought me several homemade sauces (try the sweet one)
For dinner I ate lettuce wraps that came with different grilled meats and condiments for me to customize
My friend ate soup that was so fresh the broth was poured onto the soup in front of us
After stuffing ourselves with the best meal in months our server suggested dessert
We shared a bannana, coconut custard thingy were in heaven
Everything from the drinks to the food to the service was phenomenal
The people knew how to treat their guests and the ambience was calming (candle light)
Before leaving the server gave us takeout menus
Did I mention she was hot?
The place is hip, the food was a balanced fusion of Korean, Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese ingredients, and they had flights of Soju and Sake
The specialty drinks were great too
I had the homemade Kimchi and sauces and I was in heaven with all the new flavors I was experiencing
I felt like I was in a cool place in Asia
Soju is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood
The food is soooo tasty! I have eaten there a few times and have not been disappointed
The service is friendly, comfortable atmosphere
Once you have been there you will go back again and again
The owners Joe and chef Diane make you feel at home
This place has a wonderful warm neighborhood feel and the food is amazing!
Received a gift basket from Arte as a gift - wonderful selection of foods - delicious too - creatively packaged by a talented employee!!!
This new gem on Columbus has been my stop everyday before work and sometimes on my way back
They have the best coffee and bake goods in the area (the muffins are a must try) and the service is very affable
The items offered change periodically so I always find something new and they have very creative options to the so boring chicken and salad that you find eveywhere
If you need grocery they have a whole line of hard to find Italian stuff
I love it!
If you're looking for a gourmet treat or something special to stock your kitchen (and you don't want to be knocked over at Fairway) try this tiny place
They are friendly and knowledgeable
Some of the oils I haven't seen anywhere else
I've never had such a horrid dining experience in New York
There were only 2 other tables occupied when we sat down and still it took the waiter 20 minutes to take uour order and another 30 minutes to get our salads
My caesar salad had no taste whatsoever and my firend's artichoke salad had even less
Another 45 minutes later and our sandwiches came out but they were the wrong order and the waiter gave us so much attitude and argued when we didn't want them
We could barely get him to fill up our water glasses and get a drink while we were waiting, he spent all his time chatting with another table
He even had the audacity to follow us out of the restuarant yelling after we left (and paid the full bill)
I like Mangiami a lot it's better and even more intimate then being in a good friend dining room, the food is straight forward with good quality ingredient , i had the breasaola and a penne pasta
the bartender/owner makes a mean caprioska
cool vibe and live dj with really well suited beats
It might be a better find of Freeman down the street
Straightforward rustic italian fare well made with high quality ingredients
Excellent value considering the quality of the ingredients
Definitely recommend for lunch or dinner
Simply a great place
laid back vibe with broad selection of loose-leaf teas, great coffee and top quality food
Met some friends there so we hung out for a while sampling alot of things (curry chicken salad sandwich-mmm; Communitea salad; portobello mushroom cheddar panini, homemade brownies - yeah!)
Music was awesome
Has huge front windows so can watch the world go by and free wifi, newspapers, games, magazines
I really enjoyed my meal at loside, and always have
I have yet to have a bad experience here
The food is tasty and the service is awesome
Terrible place
the most horrible service

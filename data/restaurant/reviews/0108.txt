The food and ambience was so impressive that I took my date there the following week
I recommend the short ribs, watercress and Kimichi pancake
Also, the cosmopolitans I had were delicious
Gotta go at least once! -GNG
If Japanese hibachi is what you're used to, Korean BBQ is not for you
Unless you want to leave the comfort of you home to cook your own food for $50 that is
Don't be deceived by the happy hour specials because those yummy cocktails on the menu are not included
This place valiantly tries to make Korean food both trendy and less foreign
For those of you who have never tried Korean food before, this might be a good way to start developing a palate for it; for those of you who are Korean food veterans, you all already know that K-Town's where the better stuff is
On the up side, this place doesn't grill their meat on tables, so you won't be smelling like your dinner on the way out with your date (it's a great date spot)
This place was okay but sitting there amidst a young, predominantly non-Korean crowd, sampling my boyfriend's vegetarian jap-chae, I longed for the bustle, no-frills atmosphere of the true Korean shik-dang experience, where practically every dish is infused with meat or fish something or other
It's a good place to go if you have vegetarian buddies who want to try Korean food or if you want to introduce someone wary of ethnic flavors to Korean cuisine
I would have rather slurped some bibimgooksoo at Hanbat, downed some smoothly seasoned kongbiji at Chodanggol or even munched on some chewy Nakji bokum at the Mill
The food service was great! Good ambience as well
Would definitely recommend to others
How disappointing
I came here not expecting anything amazing, yet I was still underwhelmed
For these prices--and this place is NOT cheap--I was expecting delicious--if Westernized--versions of my longtime faves
But what I received fell way short--medium-sized portions of flavorless modern Korean food served to people who don't know any better
And what Korean restaurant makes you pay for banchan? I suppose it's acceptable if your customers don't know better and assume that these are appetizers rather than an integral--and free--part of the meal
But what disturbs me the most is that this place doesn't seem to be trying very hard--the food was sloppily prepared, thus the flavors are way off--either too sweet, or in most cases, not spicy enough
It doesn't even seem that there's a real Korean person actually cooking or at least supervising the food preparation in the kitchen
This is the best korean food in the city! No comparison to the sometimes greasy and over sauced Korean restaurant in midtown and you won't find a more chic or sophisticated Korean restaurant
I'm korean and I have to say this is the freshest and cleanest Korean food I've had next to my mom's
The spicy pork ribs are out of this world! Spicy and succulent and it just falls off the bone! The spicy squid is also a favorite of mine; it is spicy and sweet with out being to oily and the squid is soooo tender
You have to try their great drinks too! I can't say enough about Do Hwa
Can't wait to go back!
What a great Restaurant! Some of the best Korean food in NYC, real homestyle cooking! Also, they have a great bar with specialty drinks that are amazing! Great place!
wow
what a great place
The quality of the food, the scope of the menu, amazing
I was impressed with the seafood portion of the menu, along with the variety of soups
What an authentic Korean restaurant, one that understands there is more to Korean food than BBQ! (although the grill dishes were very good, too!) If you haven't been here, GO NOW! you will not regret it!
Met a friend here for dinner, it was the first for both of us and we loved it! Funky, hip, fancy, darkly lit, modern decor, with a nice breeze flowing through the large window at the front of the restaurant
Our waitress (with a cool tattoo on her arm) was cute and friendly! Expensive food, but as a Korean-American, I can tell you that the BBQ ribs and spicy seafood soup were excellent
Good with a group of friends, *maybe* for a date, but it's kind of noisy
A bit upscale, but with a friendly staff
Do Hwa is the best Korean restaurant I've encountered so far in NYC
Yes, the BBQ beef (bulgogi) is a little too pricey but the food overall is delicious
I also love the modern decor as well as the terrific service
As for whether the food is authentic, I am Korean and I think it's pretty darn authentic as well as delicious! Bottom line: yes, a bit pricey but great food in a great environment!
If you want traditional Korean, you must go midtown
But this place is great for a downtown Korean restaurant - delicious food, good ambience, fantastic bartenders, and rarely a wait
I've been there countles times and am never disappointed
Sit at the bar and enjoy
The Scene It's difficult not to fall for this tiny, soulful restaurant, set across the street from a small East Village park
The atmosphere is one of homey sophistication; decor includes a tile floor, wobbly wooden tables and a huge spray of pink flowers atop the bar
The largely female kitchen crew and service staff go about their work with pride
The Food Chef-owner Gabrielle Hamilton works out of an open kitchen the size of a bus shelter, turning out hearty, elegant and seasonal New American cuisine
Whole roasted branzino, a well-charred rib eye steak and roast suckling pig are typical dinner entrees
The popular weekend brunches are exceptional--standout offerings include a hearty rendition of eggs Benedict and the single, plate-sized pancake with pears and raspberries
An expertly made bloody mary completes the experience
I've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all
Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting
The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had)
I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY
You walk though a narrow door and are transported to a world of simple but truly delicious food
It's gourmet, but tastes and feels homemade
The head-on shrimps with anchovy butter had me licking the plate
The sweetbreads were by far the best I've ever had (and I don't even like sweetbreads)
The buttered radishes were crunchy and satisfying
Everything they do here is unique and scrumptious
I will be back many many times
I frequently entertain clients at Prune
They offer a great menu for an exceptionally reasonable price
The views of the lower East Side are spectacular for my out-of-town guests, as is the food and the friendly, attentive service
I don't get it, what's so special about Prune ? not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out
Over price, and small portions
Its more of a diner than a restaurant my friends and I will never go back
A WASTE
I have to agree with the previous reviewer
I don't get it either
Not impressed with the food
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant
Zero ambiance to boot
Shabby chic
and that was the food
This hole in the wall had the most overpriced sub par food I've ever eaten
I can't believe they have the nerve to charge those prices
The rib eye was a joke
A huge portion tried to make up for the fact that there are no sides unless you pay for them
I thought $29
00 was enough to cover a little piece of something green
The NJ tomatoes were a joke
Big (again) slabs of nothing but the tasteless fruit
I've had better from my back yard
I haven't even started on the room
Looked dirty, not cute and cozy
At least dim the lights so you can't see how bad it is
It was so bright I thought it might second as a helipad
Save your money and your stomach
Too many other great places to go to rather than waste it here
With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees
We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable
No plans to return anytime soon
The hype says Prune is the haunt of off-duty chefs
So, perhaps our expectations were too high

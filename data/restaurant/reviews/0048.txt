Small quaint place on 2nd floor, the restaurant set up efficiently uses it's space
There are 4 sushi chefs working including a newly added woman sushi chef (a rare sight indeed!)
Bathrooms pleasantly nice clean
But, how is the food/sushi? Very good
Sushi is consistently fresh, service pleasant Sushi rice is a bit hard
Other foods were fine
Did not try their 'infamous' Kaiseki offering, rather spend extra $ on more sashimi
Regulars abound at lunch so get there early
Weekends has a good showing
1/2 price saturdays! weekdays dinner lot more $
Service could be better
The SUM IT: Do try this place at least once
Recommend the small 8-10 seat front room if you can reserve the space or the sushi bar (main dining room is tight)
Best value is the sushi/sashimi lunch combo - get the large for double pieces on sushi!
Half off everything on Saturday dinners! Food was great
Was kind of weird to wait in the stairwell for seating, but was definitely worth it!
A friend recommended this place
Went on saturday night for half price special (everything 50% off!!!!!!)
I showed up with 3 other people at 6 pm
The place doesn't take reservations and was already packed
On saturdays, this place offers a tremendous value in the half price special -- again everything on menu
However, this comes at the expense at potentially long lines and slow service
Go early and get there before 6pm
Sushi was good quality
Not the best, but definitely respectable
Excellent quality for 50% off
Sushi was fresh tasting, with nice variety in the standard 10 piece platter
Rolls were well prepared and generous in contents
Definitely a fantastic value
Not in upper echelon of sushi joints, but definitely better than most
Go early
I have only nice things to say about this place
I was seated promptly and the service was excellent
My date and I had the small room all to ourselves so the ambience was wonderful
They quickly changed the table cloth and chair after I knocked over the bottle of soy sauce (I hit it with the menu
oopsie!)
The prices recently went up but this is Manhattan folks, expect your wallet to be bruised up a little after a good meal
I'll take quality over quantity any day
Loved the green tea ice cream!
The sushi was delicious and fresh and they didn't short you on the pieces of fish either
Delicious soup and a very relaxing atmosphere
delicious and super fresh sushi! ask to sit at the suchi bar so you have a chance to speak with the head chef
this place is certified to serve the poisonous blowfish!
heed the advice of previous reviewers
sushi rose has fabulous fresh fish, wonderful house sake, and some interesting and inventive sushi combinations
eat here
you WILL like it
Sushi Rose is home to the most impeccable fresh fish I've eaten in the city
The sushi practically swims up to the warmly lit, modern sushi bar with a smile
Thanks to the wonderfully attentive service and traditional Japanese atmosphere, Sushi Rose deserves the nod for finest sushi restaurant in all of Manhattan
Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for dinner, assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook
Everyone treats you like you were part of the family
We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes
Two people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu
We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house
They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table
A great experience!
Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter
The wine list is excellent
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave
Wonderful at holiday time
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly
The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal
Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house
I suspect this restaurant is what Rao's would be if it hadn't turned exclusive
The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not
I'm constantly impressed by the waiters-- true professionals who seem to be having a great time
The decor is a bit cheesy, and the owner doesn't seem to mind when a regular feels like smoking an illicit cigarette (grrr
) but I guess that kinda adds to the charm
The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber
The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be
Save yourself from this awful place! I went to this restaurant for a going away party for a dear friend of mine
We were a party of five
The waitress literally bullied us into ordering immediately
When we were halfway through the meal, they began clearing plates without asking us when the plates still had food on them
We were in shock
I asked to see the manager and explained to him that this was poor form and that we were not finished
Hovering over me, he explained that this was his restaurant, that other people were waiting, and we needed to get out now
We quickly paid, of course leaving no tip
The waitress saw this and began berating us in front of the other customers
My wife went to the front cashier to ask for the manager's name
The manager saw this and came running over and physically intimidated her
I stepped in and asked him to back away
He and two waiters then literally pushed me out the front door cursing me! I'm still deciding whether to bring criminal charges for assault
For the love of God, please don't support this awful business
There are so many other good Korean restaurants in this neighborhood
I am in a state of disbelief over this incredibly negative experience
We were a table of 8 and the waitress practically bullied us into ordering when we weren't ready
She only appeared at the table to hurriedly sling around the BBQ, then she disappeared
The dishes were plucked from beneath our noses even when we weren't finished
The orange slices signalling the end of the dinner was brought to our table even though we were still eating the main entrees
The bill of course was delivered soon after without our prompting
Not 5 minutes passed before the server actually tapped us on the shoulder and, I swear to god, ASKED US TO LEAVE because they had a reservation
Won Jo's extensive menu features a myriad of both Korean and Japanese dishes served 24 hours a day
The banchan is probably the best in the entire city and worth a visit by itself
Soups and stews are done especially well here as are the long list of noodle dishes

I recommend the Mamao com camarao salad with shrimp
During a weeknight, it wasn't crowded, but the servers kept coming up to check but didn't disturb you
Aside from the food, the best part about my visit was the couple having a serious argument a few tables away - wonderful dining drama
It did seem, however, that they took their time in between courses
It's pricey, but worth it
Went there on the Friday night before Memorial Day
Place was kind of empty but I can imagine it was because everyone was out of town
The food was flavorful and excellent; the service outstanding
Our waiter actually recommended a cheaper wine than the one we were looking at which resulted in a larger than average tip
The cirucs theme was nice (my date loved it) but I still don't know how that relates to Brazil
This juxtaposition was irrelevant as we had a great time
I highly recommend Brazilian cuisine to anyone who wants a change from the plethora of Italian and French resteraunts in Manhattan
Highly recommended!
Circus - a Brazilian restaurant on the Upper East Side is a delightful place
Right on Lexington Ave there is space for a couple of tables right on the sidewalk
The staff are friendly and pleasant, the food is different and cooked well and the price was not as bad as many other places in the area
For dessert the crepes are to die for! Another friendly neighborhood restaurant but the Brazilian twist makes it a great change
This place was great to bring people from out of town
The food is unique and different and the decor is fabulous
I went to dinner at Circus tonight
It's a nice mid-sized restaurant (though the American circus theme for a Brazilian restaurant is a little perplexing), attracting more sedate chic crowd
The food was very tasty, the wine list respectable and the prices quite reasonable for the neighborhood
My complaint was with the service-- our waitress was rather pushy and visibly annoyed when we didn't order appetizers or dessert
Don't expect to be amazed, but overall a safe bet for a pleasant evening
Would make a good date restaurant
The place is nice, food is good, given there are only 2 other brazilian restaurants in the city anyway, it is not very meaty, which is good, decent spread out menu, good food
service was good when I was there
worth a shot
nothing extravagant!
This is pretty much the only light Italian restaurant in the city and it is really good! You can tell when you eat the food that it is made with less oils and cholesterol-laden ingredients, but that is not a bad thing because it is good
You don't walk out feeling blotted and regretful
Great place to grab a casual dinner, meet up with a long lost friend, or share a bottle of wine with a long time lover
Recommend the grilled calamari, black ink squid pasta dish, garlic bread with cheese (warning: a lot of garlic!), and pesto pizza!
Favia offers really good Italian food at reasonable prices
If you are in the mood for a pizza but want to avoid the fat and calories (or at least cut down), Favia makes a delicious lite version
Definitely worth trying
No complaints here - Favia is consistently reliable with great thin slice pizzas and a variety of pasta and italian- style meat dishes
Very casual, you can come in after shopping at Bloomies for a light, easy meal
And it's all low-fat (or so they say!!!)
GREAT RESTAURANT
WONDERFUL FOOD
THEY HAVE AN EXCELLENT LUNCH MENU
THE OUTDOOR SEATING IS WONDERFUL ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON, ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER
PERFECT IF YOU ARE SHOPPING AT BLOOMIE'S GREAT ITALIAN RESTAURANT AND THE PRICES ARE REASONABLE
THE WAITERS ARE REALLY UNDERSTANDING AND HELPFUL
I TOOK MY BOYFRIEND HERE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND WE WERE SEATED AT A CORNER TABLE IN LIKE A PRIVATE ROOM BY A WINDOW, IT WAS VERY ROMANTIC AND THE FOOD AND THE SERVICE WAS OUTSTANDING
THE WAITERS WERE VERY ATTENTIVE AND FRIENDLY
I ALSO RECOMMEND THAT U DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT HAVING A PIECE OF TIRAMISU,IT IS THE BEST I'VE EVER TASTED! I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK
My boyfriend took me here last night for my birthday and it was so much fun! We sat alone in a private dining room which I would highly recommend if you can get it
The service was great, really old school
The baked clams were delicious and so was the chicken marsala
There wasn't a single thing that could have been better
I took my fiancee here for her birthday last year, and we instantly fell in love with the place
The service is outstanding and the food is delicious
I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to go on a romantic date
I recently ate at Isle of Capri with four other friends and had a delightful dining experience
The food was excellent , but I was most impressed with the service
I highly recommend
Got hungry and happened to be in the area
lucky for me
What a fabulous little place
The staff is friendly, the handmade pasta is scrumptious and the prices won't break the bank
All in all a wonderful dining experience
How sad
Poor average fare
Sggy Standard Milanese
Staff that wanted the order taken by 9
20 on a Saturday night for the kitchen closing
Great Wine List
for value
But the whole experience was of '70's gone wrong
Underdressed vs casual locals with tux wearing waiters
A maitre D who has been there since '54 (his words) but lloked jaded and bored (mine)
No, they need to spruces up
Not re invent, just remember what a decent local place can be
Until then don't go
Sad decor
I have been going to the Isle of Capri for almost fifteen years and it is unwavering in its fine food and family-like service
There are dishes that you won't find on many Italian menus and the braciole (chicken or beef) is as close to my Grandmother's as I have ever found
My wife loves the chicken dishes and I have never had a special request that they have not honored
Sit near the window and get the best of a sidewalk cafe experience without the noise and the dust!
I finally tried Isle of Capri last nght for the first time and I live right next to it
I thought the food was great and simple and they had so many choices
I had the caprese salad and then veal picata and both were great! The atmosphere is a little old, but if you get to sit at the window, it is very nice
The service is great and the waiters are very attentive
This is a nice neighborhood italian that i will definitely go to again
Not only is the food mouth watering but the services is overwelming with a touch of class!
I wanted to find a nice place to eat that was near the Four Seasons Hotel
I read your review on the Isle of Capri and it was a very good review but there was only one
For all I new, that review might have come from the owners son
We went last night
By the way we were treated they most have thought I was the owners son
Great food, Great service
But the rating giving it a 10 was a little askew
The rating should have been 10+ RMC Ken Kelly, USN, Retired
Love it
I always go with out-of-towners
Get the paglia fieno
this place no doubt has great food, but the atmosphere is awful
if you are younger and looking for a fun, upbeat time, do not go here

Even better than the service though, is the food
The Hanger steak (MUST be ordered with the mustard sauce) was completely amazing, and the terrine and pear appetizer that my date ordered was absolutely phenomenal
We both had three courses and shared a great bottle of wine, and the bill with tip still fell well below $150
If you enjoy hunting out great French spots in NYC, definitely pay Moutarde a visit
I feel that I give restaurants a fair chance
But I've been to Moutarde three times for dinner and I consistantly receive slow service and mediocre food
The room is designed where noise bounces causing everyone to scream louder to be heard
The decor is fussy and a Disney-fied idea of being French
All this would be dismissible if the service and food was up to par
I appreciate a chef who likes to take chances or can do classics well
Unfortunately, my dish was completely cold and the leeks still had sand in them
And I'm amazed that the chef created a duck breast dish so flavorless
It seems that the chef doesn't know how to marry flavors well
Like I said, I gave the restaurant three times (usually because someone in the party wanted to try it), and trust me there will not be a fourth
The food is completely mediocre
I ordered the tuna tartar app that contained so much gristle that no amount of chewing could masticate
In fact, there was so much gristle that the chunks of tuna came out of the kitchen still all connected together
The ratatouille that came with my entre was nearly devoid of any flavor
It is appalling that they charge as much as they do for such unremarkable fare
The food was so bad that my dining companions did not even finish their meals (but I'll leave it to them to complain here for themselves)
I don't understand why people are willing to wait as long as they do for a table here
The food is horrible
The prices are high
Don't eat here if you like food
We took some family there last night (Party of 4), and were seated at a cramped table
We asked to be moved and they sat us at the only booth in the restaurant
As we were seated, a part or 5 or 6 showed up and a waiter came and asked us if we would be 4 or 6 at the table
After telling him we were 4, he tried to guilt trip us into moving instead of just asking (Well, I guess the guests will just have to wait 2 hours while you eat, since you're sitting in the only booth in the restaurant
) He hemmed and hawed awhile until finally we just got up and left
Given the level of service and the average quality of the food, there are FAR better places to eat in Park Slope (Cocotte comes instantly to mind
)
Four of us had lunch at Moutarde last week - there were two other tables, two other tables
We ordered one crepe, two omelet dishes and one salad; it took one hour to get our food
Our server was very nice but she never apologized
We liked the food and we're new to the area but we'll never return
Since moving to the neighborhood over a year ago, this easily the worst service I have experienced in the Slope/Heights/Cobble Hill/Brooklyn Heights area
On my first visit, we walked out after waiting for ten minutes with no sign of a maitre'd
Chancing fate again on a second visit, we waited for close to ten minutes, again with no sign of a maitre'd, though we were eventually seated by a server
Once seated, we were treated to an epic wait before a server appeared, followed by bungled orders, delayed food, and a room that seems to be designed to be as loud and uncomfortable as possible
In fairness, once the food arrived, it was uniformly excellent, but there are other places to go in the area for food just as good, with service that matches
Great outdoor seating and the prettiest bartender in Brooklyn
Highly recommed for warm summer nights
My husband and I have visited this restaurant many many times, as the food is good, but since the service is so terrible we will not go again
One evening we had out of town guests with us, who have just arrived after a long trip
And it took over 2 hours to get our meals
Other tables came and went while we were still waiting on salads
When the manager was asked for things did imporve but 2 hours to get our meal
not good
After reading the very good and very critical reviews on line of Moutarde, were very surprised at how good the service was on a Mother's Day
The restaurant was packed but the service was quite fast, with no pressure to free up tables, and very friendly
Prices were reasonable, certainly comparable to other bistros in NYC and to upscale restaurants in Brooklyn
The menu was interesting and varied and the food was ok if not great
The house wine was drinkable and the appetizers and desserts quite good
Servings were generous
My only complaint was the noise
When the restaurant is full the noise level is quite high
Best to go outside of rush hours because of that
Adorable looking place
Great tasting, well priced menu selections
Very sweet attentive staff
Sometimes very busy but always accomodating
I love this place
It doesn't get better than this for a nice, simple brunch
Moutarde is a cute place with great food
The service is friendly, though, it can be a little slow
However, one great thing is that they'll never rush you
I had dinner there last night and sat there eating, drinking, and reading for 2 hours without any rush
Their wine is good and the food is solid
The steak frites are great, so many fries that you can't even finish it
Not a good date place, as is can get loud and is quite bright, but a good place for a solo meal or nice meal among friends
It's also family friendly
The food is a bit cheaper than several area restaurants, but tastes great! We got seated right away
The waitress was polite and we were served very quickly
I love the atmostphere and the decor
I've been there for dessert and it was very slow, but brunch is spectacular!
Where could I start? This place has such aweful service, I will NEVER eat here again
The so-called manager was absolutely rude and un-accommodating
The food is sub-par at best, a mediocre wine list
After numerous mistakes in the orders and by the wait-staff, no applogies
just a smug attitude by the rude manager/ownder (or whatever the heck he is
those of you who were unfortunate enough to go there know whom I speak of)
Never eating here again, and will never recommend it to anyone
If you're tired of the long waits for table at nearby place, then head to Moutarde for a delicious meal that won't keep you waiting
We've been there several times and enjoyed excellent food and service every time
I've only been to Moutarde once, for brunch, and I had a thoroughly pleasant experience
The service was attentive, professional, and friendly
The food was very good, although I admit that the brunch menu was not very adventurous
Our waiter brought us a basket of croissants hot from the oven which were melt-in-your mouth delicious
The decor was very faux authentic, down to the zinc bar, and reminded me of a brasserie in Paris that I used to visit often
Everyone in our group vowed to return another day
Moutarde passes for more than an eatery
Outside of the flavorful cuisine and comfortable seating area there is a stylish bar upfront that provides refuge from the cold, especially if you like Hot Apple Cider
I went on a Sunday night and it was quiet
I thought the quality of the food was good
Overall I thought the service was good, the price was right although the decor was a little over the top
The pannacotta was a real gem, the server offered great wine advice, and we never felt rushed
However, sometimes the mustard in every dish wasn't at subtle or as well incorporated as I would've expected, the espresso tasted of burnt coffee beans and the hanger steak was medium but with a charred outside
I've had brunch at Moutarde twice and both times my egg dishes (Benedict, Wild Mushroom Omelet) were almost perfectly prepared
The price is right too, all egg dishes were under $10
But then there's the sluggish and absentminded service: twice someone tried to serve us something for another table and it took a long time to get our check

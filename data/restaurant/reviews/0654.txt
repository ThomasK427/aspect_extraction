It's small and intimate without being pretentious
Also, both the bartenders and waitstaff know how to treat customers well, from recommending a meal to buying regulars a free round
both Tom and Kevin, the bartenders are great
Caleigh and Robin are awesome as well
I have frequented this place since it opened
their menu has gotten substantially better, and the beers on tap are not matched anywhere (even though there's only 6)
I highly recommend it, though the food is on the dryish-thickish side
What the hell, it German!
Their backyard dining option is nice, but the inside (and front) seems to have some kind of under construction look (and smell) to it
The menu leans very much to the vegetarian side of the fence, so it's a bit unusual
The service, however, was very absentminded
After waiting 20 minutes after the check came, I had to go find someone to pay
Not someplace I'd go to again on purpose
ok, I went to Melissa Blue this past Friday night
It was surprisngly crowded
It was me and my girlfriend
We started off with the vegetarian buffalo wings
They were good
I didn't know what to expect
Reall good though
Then, we both had burgers after
I usually get burgers at wnother spot up the block
BUT I liked the added something they put in the burger
I couldn't tell what it was though
Since it was raining on Friday we had to sit inside and not in the back outside area
We are going to check it out later this week if the weather is nice
Overall I guess I would give it an above average rating
They need to get beer on tap rather than bottles
I went to a party at Melissa Blue one night and very much enjoyed eating and drinking in the back garden patio
Its close to my apartment which is nice
I think its a good date place if you eat in the patio in the back
A little corner of France in Soho, the cuisine is creative and tasteful, on several day a week they have live performance that literrally transport you to Moulin Rouge
The service is attentive friendly and yes French
I would recommend this place to my dear friends and loved one for a fun dining experience ,romantic and french nostalagia
This new restaurant is a find to share with special people
Happiness and friendship reside here
This is an exceptional restaurant
I am never disappointed
There are a lot of greek restaurants in the city and most of them do the cuisine a serious disservice
If don't love greek food yet, come to Tarverna Roumeli and let them disabuse you of any doubts
To top it all, the prices are very reasonable and staff incredibly courteous
This place is worth the trip from Manhattan
The kontosouvli (pork dish) and garithes tourkolimano (a shrimp dish) are both amazing
Also, always check to see if they have yoghurt for desert
It can be a life altering experience
I have spent many an enjoyable evening at Roumeli Taverna, and find that the food is exceptional, service always courteous and responsive and the decor reminiscient of the Aegean
My favorite dish is Kotopoulos Stithos, which is marinated chicken, with lemon potatoes and a medley of sauteed mediterranean vegetables - absolutely fabulous! I highly reccommend the intimate atmosphere for coulpes or parties
This place is grat, I live across the street and go all the time
The portions are very large and the service is fantastic!! I recomend the chicken milanese
Its the perfect date night palce, its very true you can never judge a book by its cover, because i walked by it a 100x with out every going in
Im glad I did!!  Cheers
The decor is truly depressing and the service is very rude and curt
Expect to get average food, a big bill and lots of attitude from the service
Brio Forno is a much better option
The food here is great
Fresh pasta with simple sauces are my favorite
The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly
The prices are reasonable
Worth a visit even if you aren't in the neighborhood
This place has gotten even better
It was cute with good food when it first opened, but in the last year ZaZa has expanded with a back room and outdoor garden
You can't see the extra room or garden from the sidewalk--which makes them both all the more nicer and private
The food is reasonably priced and I've never had a bad meal here or anything less than great service
I live in the area, so I eat here often
you might miss the garden! As you walk on First Ave, this place looks like a real hole-in-the-wall with very few people in it
But, there's a second room behind the front section with a neat garden room after that
It really is a pleasant place with a comfortable, open feel
And, the food??? Excellent! Salads are a little different and very tasty and the pastas and other entrees are fabulous
The fettucine with peas, potatoes and pesto is terrific! This is definitely a place you'll want to try again and again! The food, the ambience and the service are all first-rate!
I work near this restaurant (York Ave
) and I was happy to see it go up
This area needs more places like this (good food, inexpensive, nice decor)
I have been there three times already and I think this is one of the best, most affordable italian restaurants in the city
You really should'nt miss out on this one!
Tiengarden has funky hours and not much room to sit down, but the food is so delicious
unlike a lot of other animal free restaurants, you can get really good food that's NOT DEEP FRIED
The one dude that always seems to wait on us is super nice and helpful, and the food is so good that you'll love it even if you're a diehard carnivore
My experience at the Sequoia was one of the worst New York easting experiences I have ever had
The staff were all over weight, unkempt, inattentive, running around, there was only one waiter per 15 tables
The potatoes were undercooked the salmon was under cooked, cold and looked microwaved
The acoustics were horrible as I could not even hear my friend next to me
I almost got up and left as the happy hour bunch started to taunt a co worker to chug chug chug
If you want to empress a girl friend or anyone else for the matter forget it
If you want to get a good cocktail and view clueless tourists then this is the place
The Sequoia NY is NOTHING like its sister restaurant in Washington, which is a shame
I think I will never got to another Ark restaurant again
It was just appalling
Sequoia was very disappointing
The food was blah, my pasta was cold
The view was boring
We had a 9:30 reservation
By 11:00 the staff was putting the chairs on top of the tables and we felt rushed to leave
I'll never go back
We went for Downtown for Dinner 2002 and this is NOT the way to get people to eat downtown
The bread was cold, the farfelle had no flavor and when we sent it back and ordered the fish, chicken was brought to us-- my friend is a vegetarian
Someone needs to tell the chef that pumpkin cheesecake is not regular cheesecake with pumpkin flavored whipped cream
In addition, we weren't sure who our server was- had our choice of three- and the wrong check was brought to our table
I don't consider good amience looking at Champs Sporting Goods
In Short Boomerangs, Aussie flags, kangaroo portraits and faux aboriginal art honor the homeland's wilderness, but Outback delivers a polished version of rusticity with varnished blond-wood booths with matching wainscoting and casually uniformed waitstaff
Besides more than a half-dozen cuts of steak, diners can pick from large-portioned entrees like ribs, chops and shrimp or chicken "on the barbie

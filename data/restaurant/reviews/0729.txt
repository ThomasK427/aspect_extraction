Otherwise I'd make reservations somewhere else if it were up to me
I love Jean Georges, but maybe he should stick to French cooking *shrug*
I had a great evening having expected the worse given the reviews
The service was attentive, the food was very good and served promptly
I thought the bill was cheap
The interior is so relaxing, and the non-waiting staff very pleasant
66 has great food and some good drinks, but the desserts are lacking
It is also a little pricey for what it is, but it is good
I ordered the crispy garlic chicken and the scallion pancakes and my friend ordered the spareribs and the sirloin
We also had an amazing veggie fried rice
The dishes were good and the rice is a must, but I have to say that I like the food at Mr
Chow a little better
The scene at 66 is more appealing to me and the space is wonderful and I will go back
Food had no presentation
Didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food
Could have had better for 1/3 the price in Chinatown
People seated next to us had the same opinion of the restaurant
Host and Hostess was quite rude
Looked at us like we were from outer space, when they themselves look that way
Would not recommend anyone to go
You will not be missing anything
Ordinary Chinese food at extraordinary price -- frog leg tasted like (overcooked) chicken; shrimp-foie gras dumpling only tasted (not-so-fresh) shrimp; tapioca is too watery
They hang up on me when I tried to reserve for a communal table and gave us a big attitude when we showed up at door 6pm without a reservation
Besides, I hated waitress uniform
Definitely not going back again
i went there last night and thoroughly enjoyed 66
the atmosphere was very nice
super trendy but not rude waitstaff
it was a pleasure, i plan on going back and when i do i would request a seat near the fish tank
the food was good but must be carefully ordered
i definately recommend the shrimp toast and dumplings
service wasn't very good, but the waitstaff made up for it by being very nice
I can see 66 has been planned with the most current restaurant consultant thinking about how to make big dollars with an ethnic place: cool, minimalist decor and furniture; good tunes; funky drinks; communal table; lots of pre-opening PR buzz; big name chef; ethnic cuisine that's been refined for urban palates
Well, like most formula places they always seem to leave out the most important ingredient from the food and the place: soul
Plus the cooking is very uneven -- pretty good the first time and then pretty forgettable the second
Check it out once to see what's up, then leave it for the out of towners who don't know any better
So overhyped: the only crowd here is wannabes
The food is overpriced and the service is pretentious
Dont get the lobster - $$$$$ - it comes as a tiny serve and the blackbean sauce is definitely not made by anyone skilled in asian cuisine
The prawn dumplings dont even have real prawn inside - just reconstituted rubbish at $7 - skip the dimsum!!! the room is too big and cold and the lighting is cheap - they must have just bought harware store dimmers for the switches
go once but you'll regret it
Reservations a month in advance
Seated at a table for four with three people seated next to us with the third person's back lying up against our table
Food brought to our table that we did not order
Wine spilled on the table
Not done swallowing our appetizers, when the entrees started rolling out
The night manager, , friends with the party of three, not charging them
Not caring about our seating complaints
Not his area
Jean George should be embarassed with his staff
The food blew
The entrees were served before the appetizers! My local takeout chinese is MUCH better
But we were seated next to Steven Tyler
So pick your priorities
Food or scene? I'd rather eat
I have to say
with no reservations and a packed house
we got lucky
There is no bar so therefore no place to wait except the lounge that was packed so after wondering where to stand the hostess grabbed us
and sat us down
I almost felt bad for all the loungers
who were waiting an hour
The dumplings were delicious, and the exotic cocktails
refreshing
The design was a little too cold and hollow
with all the sounds reminding me of my elementary school cafeteria
Made the mistake of taking an 11PM reservation
Seated late, and they were out of at least 6 mainstay dishes at that time
if you're going to be open late, you need to know how much food to order! They clearly are working out the kinks, but the worst part is that I got NO satisfaction from management--but I did get lots of attitude
I guess they figure if you actually take an 11PM reservation, you're a glutton for punishment
Food was decent, although we wouldn't have ordered half the stuff we did since they were out of everything
Don't go there past 10PM!!
Had a great meal, amazing service and the scene was awesome
Jean Georges knows how to please his customers time and time again
Try the shrimp appetizer and then the Duck for main entree -- place is family style so only go with people you are willing to share with!!
CRITISIMS ARE GIBBERISH
THE PLACE, PEOPLE, MUSIC, DRINKS
ALL AMAZING, RELAXING AND FUN
I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH CLEAN, FRESH AND FLAVORFUL CHINESE FOOD: SCALLION PANCAKES WERE LIGHT AS AIR, SHRIMP TOAST SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST LIKE THIS ANYWHERE ELSE, SQUAB WITH ASIAN PEAR WAS EXPLOSIVE AND REFRESHING, THE RIBS WERE THE BEST iVE EVER HAD, AS WAS THE EGGROLL AND THE AMAZING SESAME NOODLES THAT'S MORE LIKE A SALAD THAN A PASTY MESS
LEMON CHICKEN WAS LIKE SAVORY CANDY, DELICIOUS WITH BROWN RICE, LOBSTER NOODLES WAS INCREDIBLE, TEMPURA BASS WAS SO CLEAN AND LUSCIOUS I COULDNT STOP EATING IT
PEKING DUCK WAS RUBBERY BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY FAILURE, EVEN DESSERTS WERE INTERESTING AND DELICIOUS
THIS PLACE CANT BE COMPARED TO PLACES LIKE PEEP, OR PINGS, IT IS CLEARLY MORE SOPHISTICATED AND REFINED
IT IS A MUST FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN DISCERN FRESH, FOCUSED AND GREASLESS FROM THE MSG MASSES!
Jean-Georges Does It Again - upscale, trendy, great service, fabulous presentation, high prices, and very dissapointing tatse
The food is just average
Nice bar seen
In simple words, I HATE 66
Playa-hating? Ph-leeze
There're better playas in this city of fine-dining than this pathetic establishment
I'd always respected Jean-Georges until I came here
Better Asian-influenced drinks are at Thai restaurant Peep on Spring
Great sake listing? Therere a million better places for it
The decor is something, but were talking Jean-Georges
The food shouldve been at least edible
Appetizers looked fun on the menu, disastrous on palate
Do they know Dim Sums more than just dumplings? And, where's the alleged French influence? Whatever the twist they supposedly have added is nothing new in Chinese cuisine (maybe except foie gras)
The waiter named Yuki had the nerve to lecture my friend, whos a sommelier and cocktail consultant, on how cocktails can NEVER be too sweet for aperitif
It was also comical to see older clients chowing down this nonsense food while Ludacris sang, I got Ho's
Gimme a break with all the negative reviews
The worst thing about the place is the service, which is efficient but a little clueless

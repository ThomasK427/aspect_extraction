You know, I actually like the look of this restaurant but I was dissappointed with my overall experience
It was too bright and the food just wasn't good enough
I love, love , love thai food but the sauce for the lobster was too perfumey
The crab appetizer was a bit bland, the edamame ravioli were deliciuos but spartan
My friend's Branzino was very good but like I said it was just a bit off
Made me want to go out for some good thai food
Great food, imaginative (the chef likes ravioli!), but sterile environment
Also, can you see through the bathroom door?
After eating here! I left forgetting if I had just eaten the food was so bland
I would not return there at all
We arrived 5 minutes prior to our 9pm reservation and weren't seated until 9:15pm
Once we got to our table it took 15 minutes for them to even bring a menu
At the tables on each side of me I overheard the waiter saying I'm so sorry it was to your dissatisfaction and I'm so sorry but we're out of that
Then the busgirl knocked a glass of water right into my lap! No kidding! Not ONCE did the waiter check-in to see how we were doing
I had to ask the manager for a knife (they brought me a butter knife for my lamb!)
Great food, but tiny portions and inexcusable service - disorganized, amateurish and definitely overpriced by a long shot
Went there the other night with my friends after reading Adam Platt's review in the New York Magazine
We loved everything about this new place, from the food to the decor
We had such a good time that we stayed behind to drink (and dance) at the bar lounge which has an open view to a garden
In many ways, this place is like a smaller version of 66
The menu was interesting, a twist on asian fusion
I had the foie gras which was tasty although very small
The scallop appetizer and lobster main course was very good
I think the design was elegant but too much on the cool side
actually it reminded me of a trendy bathroom interior
I would not call it romantic dining, felt more efficient than anything else, although their service was not that efficient
I think since they're new they were still sorting a few things out
I would probably not return, I think Annisa is a better restaurant and it's nearby
I recommend this for a special night out or if you make a lot of money
Jefferson is somewhat pricey, but I thought it was well worth it
The menu is really interesting and the service was excellent
The portions are somewhat small, but I didn't go home hungry, by any means
I liked the decor immensely, but I'm a fan of a clean space
I don't have too much sympathy for people who show up 20 minutes late for a meal and leave stinky reviews when they're not seated
It's inconsiderate to the restaurant and to the other diners
The portions in Jeffereson aren't huge, but the food is SO rich and satisfying, a proper dining experience for any gourmand
If you think the portions are small, order up a storm and you'll find this is a standard-priced expensive restaurant
The waitstaff are surprisingly uninformed and unintelligent, and I say this even though I liked my waiter
The seating is a little cramped but very simple, classy and comfortable
Nothing about this restaurant made us think it will survive
The minimalist decor is boring, not sleek
The service is both sloppy and disorganized, although this may improve with time
But the food was mediocre at best, from appetizers to desert
Nothing special
A wonderful addition to the neighborhood
Jefferson's spartan style is distinct and elegant
The aesthetic follows the precept less is more, while the food finds its own with interesting ingredients and sublime flavors
I am unclear as to why other reviewers mentioned small portions; I dined with two other companions and all of us were pleasantly satiated at evening's end
The wine list was also inviting; we enjoyed a superb Malbec from Argentina
Although still getting to know their way around, the staff members were very attentive and delightful
My wife and I had the best dining experience at Jefferson last night! The black silky chicken is out of this world
the scallops can not be prepared better
The virtues of the restaurant rest in the quality of the food and the thoughtfulness of the architecture
If one wants to stuff oneself, go to McDonalds! Don't change anything!
Although the decor is stark and boring, the food is full of flavor
The only problem is the entree sizes should be the appetizers
The wait staff is very nervous and seems slightly impaired
We had to ask for bread (which turned out to be a mere tasty cracker)
The lamb chops, although good, were literally four bites of meat, a tiny puddle of parsnip puree and a dot of something green-all for $26
Totally New York-overpriced and aggravating
Great place if you're dieting
I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of minimalist restaurants that don't feed you
Jefferson is a beautiful restaurant, but I'm going there to eat
The food was delicious but the portions were small
The manager came over to our table at the end of our entree course to get our review
When we said we thought the portions were small, he said he would note it
No explanation, no nothing! I'm not going back soon
Very serene, yet bustling environment
Good lighting is important
Food is delicious
Staff is anything but pretentious, as one would expect from a new restaurant
Michael was our waiter and was gracious, fun and professional
The apple potsticker dessert was delicious
Good bar crowd and welcome addition to the Village neighborhood!
Four of us dined on unusual preparations which were all excellent
Portion size is on the small, healthier side
The calorie content is also sensible, but the food is flavorful and fresh
Room ws about 1/3-1/2 full, but already noisy
The apple beggar's pocket dessert was less effective than other offerings
Lighting level too low for half the table to read the menu
Delicious, Fun, Serene, Nonpretentious, Attentive --some of the adjectives to describe Jefferson
I'm dubious of reviewers who gave ratings when they were 20 minutes late, did not get a table, but somehow tried the food! The contrast between the asian-influenced dishes and the simple but thoughtful Scandinavian ambience is unique and unmatch in NYC!
If you appreciate subtlety, a sense of refined elegance and sophistication, this place is for you
Unlike most NY cookie-cutter restaurants, Jefferson offers delicate and delicious food and a unique spatial experience -- where else can you find their shimeji mushroom dish and the spectacular skylights w/views to Jefferson Garden? I can't wait for their lunch and afternoon tea in Spring such that I can enjoy the room in a different light!
This is one of the most special restaurants in the city
The food is amazing and the decor is absolutely fabulous (not to mention the crowd)
My wife and I felt like we were dinning in the Four Seasons tasting the cuisine of Jean Georges! Yeah, the service seems a little off but you can tell the staff are trying their best in a new restaurant
started out with drinks expertly prepared by the jovial bartender who concocted our potions to our whim
as we leisurely soaked in the warm inviting ambiance, framed by japanese cherry blossoms,(or were they plum? no matter, they nonetheless were a graceful respite from the howling frozen wind of the wintery night), we were treated as invited guests by the beautiful hostess, reminiscent of catherine zeta jones- without the pomp
from our strategic corner table, we could fully appreciate the glowing amber light which reflects so graciously off human skin
the pleasant low hum of conversation inspires intimacy
this is obviously thanx to an awesome acoustic design, cleverly incorporated into the architectural space
food
i have no words to describe the delicacies for the palate, eye and soul
My friends and I had a wonderful evening at this new neighborhood delight
I'm very glad to see it doing so well
We had to wait a bit for our table, but as we were late, it was understandable
The hostess and bartenders took very good care of us
Great lighting and decor
This restaurant seems to be somewhat unpredictable

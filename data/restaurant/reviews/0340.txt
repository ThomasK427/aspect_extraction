You don't go into a sushi restaurant and say it's bad because they serve raw fish
Okay, end soapbox
I did really enjoy my meal here and do recommend it
This was my first time having Ethiopian food, so I don't know how the restaurant holds up as compared to the real deal, but once was enough for me
Most of the food has a vinegary flavor (I think because of the injera)
The lamb was tasty, but all the vinegary stuff going on around it was
different
The restaurant was small-ish, but very cute
I can't say that the waitress was overly attentive, but she wasn't horrible either
I did find it surprising that, at a restaurant where you eat w/your hands, we were not offered wet naps (at the least)
I'd recommend going just to try something new, since it's not particularly pricey
I LOVED the Ethiopian wine (we tried the one from Axum and ended up ordering two bottles)
It was so delicious that I'm on a hunt to purchase a bottle for my personal stash
I can honestly say that I love all kinds of food, thai, italian, different african cuisines etc, however Queen of Sheba had to have the worst food I have ever tasted
My best friend and I had the Dodo wat heres was the less spicy and because I love spicy food mine was the hot, the food was tasteless, lacked flavor and the chicken that was in the entrees seemed like scrap
We saw others eating what looked like chicken breast which I guess is what we should have had but the food was just bland and down right awful
I love trying new foods
The more exotic the better
However when I am trying something completely foreign to me, it is essential that my server be at least remotely friendly and helpful
NOT the case here
When we would ask a question we were luckly if we got a one word answer
We felt very out of place
When our food came, even though we ordered completely different dishes, it all came on one plate
No clue what was what it just looked like different colored mush in glops around the tray
Meat in the middle
No silverware
We assumed from watching other diners the bread was to be used as a scoop
And the gloppy mush was completely tasteless
The food is so delicious
So many spices, so flavorful, and unforgettable
I love Ethiopian food and I think Queen of Sheba is the best Ethiopian restaurant in the city
The restaurant is small but cozy
The food is excellent
For you meat lovers, I recommend the Doro Tips (chicken) and the Gomen Besiga (beef)
For you vegetarians, all of the vegetarian dishes are excellent
Be prepared to get your hands messy!
The flavors are subtle, not like what you'd find at other Ethiopian places in the city
The injera has a wonderful flavor
And they can accomodate to your tastes
I love food to be a bit spicy, and they accomodated
I highly recommend Queen of Sheba
I live in the neighborhood and I've tried several Ethiopian restaurants in Manhattan, this one is one of the best
Definitely worth the trek to Tenth Ave
The food was quite delicious, and the ambience was authetic--baskets as table-tops
I loved the vegetarian options, the lentils pureed chick peas, and my boyfriend liked the lamb
Plan to order a lot of food because the portions are slightly below average size
The buckwheat bread is wonderful and they give you plenty
The Euthopian beer is good and worth a try
The bathrooms are clean, but I did see what looked to be a cockroach in the dining area
We already knew we loved Ethiopian cuisine and were delighted with everything about this restaurant
We chose to sit at a mesob (Ethiopian Basket Table)
Although the chairs were not the most comfortable, it was so much less boring than the standard tables (which looked very nice, too)
The basket tables are now in the rear of the restaurant and are perfect for two people
2 of us shared the meat and vegetarian samplers and both were served together on the same large tray which perfectly fit into our basket table
Every bite was wonderful, but the green beans were truly fabulous
Our food was served promptly and hot (we were there at 6 PM on a Saturday)
The servers were very friendly and dressed in beautiful white cotton costumes (native to Ethiopia I assume)
I would return in a minute if I only lived in NYC
The food here is delicious and very reasonably priced
I had never tried Ethiopian food before, but it is so good that I now consider myself an addict
I very much recommend try the uncooked beef
It sounds a little scary, but it tastes fantastic
I would not recommend this place to anyone who does not like spicey food
Good food, pleasant wait staff, and a warm and inviting environment all at a reasonable price
A good bet for Ethiopian food
If you've never tried Ethiopian food before, this is THE place in NYC to do it
The menu is great and, when you look at the amount of food you gett, the value is fantastic
The owner is very friendly and an Ethiopian native who is happy to make the rounds to make sure that everyone isi doing well
For good Ethiopian food in NYC, Queen of Sheba can't be beat
This is a wonderful little restaurant off the beaten track
The food is delicious and fresh and the atmosphere is relaxed
A cozy little place to get away from the stress of the city
9 Years ago I ate Ethiopian food and thought it was the worst thing you could put in your stomach
I have been proven wrong after eating at Queen of Sheba
The food was fresh, well spiced, and delicious
I'd go back time and time again
The Jazz band on Thursdays is a great touch and the ambiance is very cool as well
This is a keeper
Cold food? It's probably supposed to be that way
Queen of Sheba has earned its spot as my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in the city, on the merit of it's consistant excellence
Excellent kategna, authentic ingredients, and great atmosphere- it is sleek and romantic, but familial and welcoming as well
The food is truly spectacular (both the cold and hot dishes), the spices are a delight, and well worth the trip to 10th Avenue
Eat here
It's wonderful
The service and ambience were very good
The food was cold and I have eaten better Ethiopian food at another restaurant
If you want to eat good Ethiopian food, I would try another place
(Maybe, it was an off night
)
Cozy little restaurant with nice atmosphere and very friendly service
We didn't have reservations and had to wait for maybe 40 min
The managers compensated by giving us free appetizer
Delish food to a good price
I am definitely coming back to this place!
Eat at the traditional African Basket Tables for a different experience
The overall atmosphere is great
There was even some cool live music starting up as we left
The Food was GREAT! However, be warned
2 entrees and an appetizer was way too much food for 2 people
Had a great dinner!

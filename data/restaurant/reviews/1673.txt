I found it hard to choose because everything looks so yummy, so I bought a little of everything as much as i could possible
The place looked really nice and service was very helpful
Great creative desserts and drinks
I esp
liked the cappuccino/cocoa/chocolate gelato drink
I've never been disappointed with their desserts, whether dining in or taking out
The service was excellent and the servers were very patient and friendly
This is a classic NY place that everyone should try at least once
it'll become one of your favorites!
I love that this place remains after 106 years of serving new york, and still holds that close relationship with its customers
Venieros is truelly unique and I greatly appreciate all my experiences there
Eventhough the desserts are great, the service holds it back
Not able to handle groups larger than 2 efficently
Occassional rude service is really disappointing
Too bad
maybe that is why the takeout line is so long??
The deserts I tried here were absolutely horrid
I don't think I finished mine, nor did the person I went with
And it's not like the place is just nice to sit around and talk either
Why do people like this place so much?? I don't understand
I say Bleck~!
This is my favorite pastry shop
I am a native New Yorker who has had desserts all over and this is the best
The Tiramisu is to die for,and the strawberry shortcake is awesome
I come all the way from Queens just to get a slice of Tiramisu
I always get the strawberry cheesecake here!! It is absolutely divine
with the clear gelatin on top
the cheesecake stays good in your fridge for a couple days
I don't like to spend money on desserts
but with Veniero's i HAVE to splurge
soooo goood!!!! mmmmmm
i can remember my first time tasting a Venieros cake; it was my birthday, i remember it was the best strawberry shortcake i ever had
it had actual chunks of strawberries inside and outside
the whipped cream ws solight and the best ever and has been ever since
i stand on the long lines for the best pastries in New york and my favorite cake the scenery is also great with an excellent staff and nice music
when i was a little kid the staff used to give me a free cookie everytime i went in
today that same friendly service has stayed the same making me a life-long devotee
nowadays i find myself buying cakes from Venieros for every single occasion possible; birthdays, business meetings, christmas, fridays, my wedding etc
the staff if great as you get to know them and make friends with them
i also bring my dates here because the ambience in the cafe is so hip
much cudos to the Venieros family for staying the best
i hope you win
Veniero's is the last gem of pastry shops
Adequately sized portions and always fresh, they shame some of the other dessert shop who present much smaller rip-off portions on nicer plates that don't even taste as great
It really doesn't make sense why there aren't more Veniero's out there and less of the ovehyped places
The Scene This place is past its prime but still trying hard to remain a scene, with striking retro decor, blaring music, dim lighting--and a waitstaff made up of out-of-work models whose snootiness and famously bad service is both humorous and irritating
The crowd is a mix of late-night NYU students, hungover brunchers looking to be seen, and various Union Square passers-by
The Food The most dependable route is to stick to appetizers--the cheese bread is quite good--and drinks
The bar does yeomanly work with cocktails, strangely excepting the acrid house caipirinha
Most of the dishes here are unmemorable, alternating between Brazilian dishes, like the thick, fishy moqueca stew of head-on shrimp, toughish scallops, and clams, and crowd-pleasers like char-grilled hamburgers and veggie burgers
The "gaucho" steak is large, lunkish, and likeable, though hardly prime; Brazilian churrasquino--grilled beef sandwich--is bready and tastes mostly of onion
I don't get the hating on this place
The waitresses are beautiful but extremely busy
Once you talk them up, they're sweet as hell! My service was amazing, I came with two of my friends and when my party increased to 8 they were extemely helpful and accomodating despite the fact that they were swamped
The food was satifying but the mojitos were spectacular and a good value
However, the mango margaritas are surprisingly where it's AT
I love Coffee Shop for a fun night with your friends
A group of us have been to the Coffee Shop at late nights and the service is always terrible
Just because Lauren Hill got discovered here does not entitled these waitstaff to act like they are better than serving people, because they are not all that attractive or friendly
We have had one waitress bring out a meat burger and serve to a vegetarian, who ordered a veggie burger, and was not at all sorry that she had made that mistake
Another waitress messed up on our orders, and had the nerve to charge us extra when she corrected the error
As we were done eating, we saw a big insect crawling on one of the tables, and she even had the nerve to bring out the bill to the customers eating at the table next to the insect
At late nights, gratuities are included, so the waitstaff does not give a damn about anybody but themselves
They need to get real and realize they are not going to get discovered with attitude as such, and do their job right
One a good note
the food is not too bad if you go for lunch/dinner
I work around Union Sqare and came here for lunch - don't bother going if you value good service
We had to get our own knives, forks and napkins, the food didn't arrive quickly, they kept on giving tables the wrong food, a homeless guy asking for money came around all of the tables while there were no waitresses around (which was for the majority of the time)
Upside: my salad - tuna with some kind of wasabi dressing - was pretty good
Good food, but the bartenders are these 21 year old girls and the service is terrible
Management: Hire some experienced bartenders - we had to ask several times for every order
Often there was no one at all at the bar near us
When I called one over and asked for change of a $20 to tip them, the girl said, We can only open the register for a sale
I said, Well, do you want a tip or not? Lame
I was going to review this place and then realized it was a complete waste of my time
A washed up place, owned by a washed up model with employees that will never get a chance to be washed up
As completely awful today as it was 10 years ago
It reminds me of a Valley Restaurant in LA
Seriously
The place is cool
It's very West Coast but the staff is a joke
A bunch of Barbazon Models who take themselves way to seriously and the people who hang out there are kind of faded and dated
I went once late-night and it was OK
went yesterday because I needed an easy place to get a mojito and a bite and was just appauled by the rude hostess and the people were so fake
70
00 for 4 mojitos, a salad and a wrap in a half-dead diner? Please
The coffee shop is worth your time
Not only are there totally hot people who work there, but there is also a great feel to the restaurant, one that is difficult to find in New York City
With dim lights and its star-studded clientele, the coffee even tastes better
Undoubtedly the worst service I've ever encountered in New York
And it's not because the servers are aspiring models
Because if that is actually the case, they're worse off than they are as servers
If your friends persuade you to check this place out, I suggest that you order all of your drinks, apps, entrees, desserts, and the check up front, because you'll never see your server again
And then I suggest that you get new friends
im pretty amazed at level of awfulness for service
i never knew the reputation behind this place, so when we waited for 20 mins without a waitress, we finally just got up to go and THEN a waitress was suddenly eager to help us
Who do these hosts and waiters think they are??? This is not some hot new club, it's one step up from a diner
I got to the reastuarant and waited on the line to put my name down
The host was away for about 10 minutes when there was a crowd of people waiting to put their names down
When he finally returned to the host station I asked for a table for two

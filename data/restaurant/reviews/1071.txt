The place was too small and not cozy
I would recommend trying the appetizers, but skip the lasanga (what they are known for)
Four of us went for dinner, and were all disappointed by our food
Two of us had salads, which were just lettuce in a bowl and the other two shared a vegetable plate which was some chopped up carrots, string beans, and potatoes in some sort of lemon juice
For our entrees two had the meat lasagna which was too buttery and creamy and the other two had the shrimp gnocci which was HORRIBLE
It seemed as though the cold cuts/cheese appetizer was popular
We did, however, enjoy our wine, which the waitress recommended
The deserts appeared to look okay, however we paid our check (in cash only) and headed to second ave deli for coffee and desert
We all agreed that hot dogs would have been a much better choice
Go for the ambiance, but not for the food
While we had to wait a while for a table due to the somewhat packed conditions of the restaurant, the staff made the wait worth it by checking on us and even bringing out a complimentary glass of wine
The BYOB feature makes the meal a deal and there may be no nicer waitress in Manhattan
The food was really good
I would recommend the Jeeb dumplings and the drunken noodles
They were really good
We got a few different plate and shared, but those were my favorite
The place is cute, but a little too small
I
This restaurant covers all the bases: location, atmosphere, style, value, service, and delicious food
The Phad Thai is a popular favorite as is the massaman and green curry
The prices are a great consider all the food you get
The food's presentation is outstanding as well
Great for a small, intimidate group party and expect good service and good food
I eat at Galanga, and order out delivery from Galanga all the time
Very efficient service, fast and friendly
Most of all, the food is excellent! I would recommend it to anyone
My friend and I found Galanga completely on accident
Now I'm hooked and usually make the trip across the Hudson to eat there at least 2 or 3 times a month
The food is delicious, the atmosphere is cozy, and you simply can't beat the prices
If you like spicy, then try the Drunken Noodles and wash it down with a cold Singha beer
Don't forget a Thai Iced Coffee before or after your meal!
Best Thai in the city
Food: Amazing! No bland, tasteless dishes here
The pad-thai is quite savory
The duck salad is amazing
You can taste their attention to detail
No full bar
Wine and beer
Ambience: Small, but they make it work
The lighting is nice
Very hip
P
S
Bathroom is quite clean and enjoyable :)  Service: Usually 2-3 wait staff, which is acceptable, as the place is small
Servers are friendly, and the food is prepared in a timely fashion
Do not bring your credit card, as they only accept cash
Value: This is what completes the package
Value is something of a lost art in the New York restaurant/bar scene
Here you get amazing food, at a clean, fun place, without having to worry next month's rent!  Overall
Check out this place
I now compare other Thai restaurants to Galanga
The food here is excellent
Try the Shrinp Fried Rice with lychee! A friend of mine loves the west 4th grilled chicken
The service is also speedy and friendly
I almost don't want this place to get too popular
It isn't very big
almost
This is a jewel of a restaurant
The food was among the best, if not the best period, Thai I've had in the city
Ambience is great, decor is modern and clean yet warm, and the service was fantastic
All they need is a full liquor bar and cocktails to match the food
Also - cash only right now - assuming that's temporary
It will be a pity once it's discovered b/c the space is small and I'll never be able to get a table again
Probably the best Thai food I have had in NYC
It's only been open for a few weeks but I have already visited 4 or 5 times
Very friendly staff and a great location
I stumbled upon Galanga on a Sunday afternoon, not typical of the standard tourist fare restaurants around West 4th Street
Galanga was a cool calm oasis with a surprisingly extensive menu, reasonably priced with quiet efficient service
Only beer and wine are served but the cool decor and tasty food make up for that and there are a myriad of places near-by to grab a 'real' drink afterwards
Whenever I am in this area, I go to Taksim
It has a great vibe
The staff will talk with you, not just take your order and run
The food is simple and delicious
Try a few small dishes to get some variety
Great Turkish beer
Definetely my fav Turkish place in the city
If you have never eaten there, you have to give it a try
This place has become one of my favorites! Everybody knows everybody, the staff is always so friendly
the food is always fresh and they have the BEST falafel sandwich in new york for $4 dollars! This place makes you feel like family
Can't say enough about it
Small and very casual - don't go to Taksim expecting ambiance
DO go to Taksim for tasty, inexpensive, and always reliable food
The service is friendly and prompt
A great spot for a laid-back after-work meal with friends
Amazing food, very friendly people
Definetely taste the lentil beans as appetizer and lambshnak for the main course
Prices are great
You could even enjoy Turkish beer with a lot of foam on top :)
I was amazed to find such a highly rated midtown restaurant (8
9 citysearch, 21(F) Zagat) in midtown with $10 entrees so I decided to try it for dinner
The place was very busy
We had to wait a bit for a table
The service was very spotty
We had to remind the waiter of what we wanted several times
The decor wasnt much to speak of
All that aside, however, the food is pretty good
The tarama (codfish caviar) was excellent, though a bit too salty
The lamb chops were pleasant
I was told the chicken kabob was good
The Turkish tea was very nice

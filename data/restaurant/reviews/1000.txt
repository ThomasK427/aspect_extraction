He ordered the Caesar salad, which was laughably small
Really it consisted of baby, uncut leaves that you could count on your fingers
The taste was fine, nothing bad nothing great
Definitely not worth the cost
It was pretty funny trying to gauge from the waitress whether dishes would be filling enough -- she basically winced and said most dishes would not be enough, and you'd need to get more
We won't be back- there are plenty of other tasty, filling options in the neighborhood
SP is a great spot
Yes, it has been discovered
Yes, it has been invaded by yuppies
Yes, its expensive
Everyone's complaints are not far off
However, if you expect any different than you are fooling yourself
If you think portions are too small, go back to Applebees
The plate sized apps are perfect
Alot of food does not make something good
The burger is very good
If you want a great burger go to a burger joint
The Gnudis are indeed fantastic and everyone orders them
The Devil on Horseback is also amazing
The service is smart and though they can be overwhelmed with the crowds, does a good job
The host/hostess' are young and attractive so what can you expect from them? Professional service? C'mon, they're eye candy give them a break
Glorious food is what you wait for, and SP serves up food worth the wait
Know what you're in for and enjoy the experience
I had dinner here with a friend who lives in the neighborhood
We went on a Saturday
knew we were in for a wait
but only had to wait 1 drinks' worth before we were seated very graciously
Adorable waiter and good food
I would concur with many reviewers who say the gnudi alone is worth a visit
We were seated next to some obnoxious women who bogarted the server's time and attention, so he bought us drinks
Perfect experience actually
I think some people who hear a lot of hype go to a place almost WANTING to have a negative experience
A little patience goes a long way
I had read good reviews about the place, so a friend and I arrived early Sunday evening for a light dinner
The host ignored us for 15 minutes and only came towards the door after 5 other people entered the restaurant
Despite the fact that I had called earlier in the day and was told that the place didn't take reservations and there were several empty tables for two on both floors, we were told that there would be a 30 minute wait
Strangely, the 5 people that came in after us were seated right away
I'm not sure when a no-reservation policy became a certain people will get served before others regardless of who got there first policy, but that certainly seemed the case
It's unfortunate that in this city, when a restaurant starts getting publicity, it inevitably buys into its own hype to the point where it cannot even provide what are commonly recognized as bare minimum standards of service
It's too bad as I live a block away
If the food and beer had lived up to its hype, I would have most certainly become a regular
ALTHOUGH we waited 2 HOURS
yes 2 hours we were seated a table for 2 when we were 4 PEOPLE! We were told for LARGE parties of 4 this is what we offer
since when is 4 a LARGE PARTY??? Dude, nice hair but you are 22 and obviously have not worked the door at Restaurants in NYC very long
do not kid a kidder
ANYWAY once we got a table worthy of $32 entrees we were VERY HAPPY with food
APPS were amazing
VERY small for $15 but yummy
good BURGER
The crowd is a little YUPPIE for an EAST VILLAGER
but I tried to remember it was a Saturday
next time I would go on a MONDay for a less BAD Blonde Highlights and Gucci bags
Cute Waiters who actually knew what they were doing
worth the wait But do not go in hungry you will wait forever and Spend $250 and still you are a little hungry when you leave unless you had the BURGER of course!
my friend and i came here for an early sunday night dinner, prepared for a very long wait
surprisingly, there was no wait (maybe because it was mothers day) and we were seated right away
per the waiters recommendation, we split the sheep ricotta gnudi as an appetizer
the gnudi (dumplings filled with cheese) were topped with a rich cream sauce and a sprinkling of brown sugar
i normally shy away from sheep cheese, but this ricotta was mild with only a hint of sharpness
for the entre, we split the skirt steak, which was tender and cooked medium rare
it was well, though simply, seasoned with salt
the thinly sliced steak was accompanied by small sweet roasted beets
bill came to $56 for the two of us
i would come again if i didnt have to wait 2 hours
head to magnolia bakery (just around the corner) for dessert!
This was the 2x I've been to the Spotted Pig
In December 2005 and it was great
This time - May 6th, 2006 it was awful!! The problem with the Pig is that it's been discovered and so consequently the staff and chefs don't seem to care anymore
The place is packed, they don't take reservations and waited almost 2 hours
(The bartender upstairs was GREAT though)! They seemed apologitic at first but I could tell they didn't mean it, we were served burnt stale bread and only after we asked for it twice! The olives were the size of a flea and not much flavor at all
The food when it finally arrived was good though - and ALMOST worth the wait! If you go, don't go hungry, have the Gnudi and or the Scallops - Amazing! Other than that prepare for the snotty and the long waits
unfriendly unbritish and no food is worthy a snotty attitude
This is the only trendy restaurant in New York that actually lives up to all the hype
Although it's crowded and service can be spotty, the food and aqmbience are among the best in the city
The sheep's milk ricotta gnudi is especially delicious, as are the desserts
Appetizers are called plates and are about $12-$16, but are not big enough to share
That is what the very best restaurants charge
Is it a fair value to charge $15 for an appetizer in a pub?   The burger is $15 dollars
It is dumped at the table, sans silverware, salt and ketchup, by the uber-trendy food runner ( who happened to be more attentive than the server on my second visit)
When I ordered, I asked the server to skip the shoe string fries and bring a side of polenta ( $6 more )
Guess what arrived? Fries, no polenta
Not a big deal
This is a pub and I am ordering a burger right? Wrong!! The burger is now $21 with the side, and with a beer it is $28
Add tax and a tip and you are up to $36 for a burg, beer and side
First, please understand I've been to the pig probably thirty times
Unfortunately I went for probably the last time this sunday
took ten minutes to place our order 2 cocktails (~$12 each), and some snacks
olives ($2
50) Almonds ($2
50) and roll mops(5
00) which the server described as sardines and nodded at the table next to us
well they are herring actually
Drinks came fifteen minutes after ordering, about three ounces each in a martini glass
ten minutes after that I chased the server down to find our snacks
a half hour after ordering we finally had our snacks
drinks were gone of course and we had two small bowls of olives and almonds that used to be free
Server was checking himself out in the mirror the whole time
I wish I would have been pickpocketed instead
it would have been less painful
I went here because the person treating wanted to go (although I've wanted to try it)

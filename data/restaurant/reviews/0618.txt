go
but don't rush
Also a lot of kids
for the pizza i guess?
We ventured into Otto for lunch just a few days after the doors opened, but prior to it's official opening, to find a very warm and pleasant atmosphere with very warm and helpful staff
The waiter took his time to explain the offerings and made some suggestions that we found to be excellent
The food was very fresh, tasty and well presented
We very much enjoyed the experience and will go back often
Fine establishment which should be held at the highest regard
Living in the neighborhood, I was excited to have a local Mario Batali restaurant to be a regular at, especially because it was going to be pizza and a block from my bed
I went 'opening night' and after waiting 40 minutes, the hostess had messed up her wait list due to a convoluted (but cute) Italian city table system they have contrived there
The appetizers are reminiscent of Lupa (of which I am a huge fan) meats, seafood, and veggies, but the main course pizza falls far short of average
I waited two hours for an ice cold pizza that was no better than bar fare, or a bad quesedilla ($85
00 for two I expected much more
) The restaurant (the old Clementine) is too big, and too nice for the food they serve there
I wish Otto luck, but unfortunately I will never go back (unless the menu changes
)

The Food Chef Scott Romano delivers three rousing New American courses wrought with seasonal ingredients and splashy techniques
Appetizers impress: Sweet shrimp-corn soup with ethereal basil foam; blood-red pepper-seared tuna over buttery mashed fingerlings with hard-boiled quail eggs; tender carpaccio, piquant with olive tapenade and pickled vegetables
Entrees are more elemental: Moist roasted chicken satisfies comfort cravings, and NY strip comes with crispy fries
Bolder appetites will appreciate port-glazed salmon with robust horseradish-bean puree and spicy chorizo-stuffed skate balanced with caramelized vegetables
Flourless chocolate cake and scooped tiramisu are simply satisfying
I had heard pretty good reviews of Kitchen 22 so I was excited to try it - boy was I in for a disappointment
The menu is VERY limited and the food descriptions very misleading
Our waitress was cold and inattentive
The food itself is mediocre at best and why does everyone get the same desert? Does everyone have the same taste? No! Basically, this place is terrible
Honestly, with all the great places in New York why waste your time?
We arrived on a Thursday night at 6:30 and were seated immediately (they don't take reservations), but, this small place filled up very quickly, and the bar was overflowing with people when we left
Obviously, a popular place for the young professionals
The prix fixe for $25 offers multiple selections of starters and entrees, the desert is the same for everyone
Our starters were very good, and the most unusual was the fried green tomatos
The entrees were less impressive
The aritchoke ravioli was uninspiring, but elegantly presented
The fish entree was tasty and recommended
All dishes were attractively plated, and the atmosphere a little noisy for across table conversations
This looks like a great place to take your date if you want to impress them, and not spend a lot of money
ahhhhhh, this place makes me long for those days when I was single, young and unattached
The 25 prix fixe meal is surprisingly good
The hummus rocks
It is a small place so be prepared for a wait if you don't have any reservations
The food is basic -- nothing exotic and there's nothing on the menu that you can't pronounce
I went on a date with my boyfriend to Kitchen 22 this past Friday
We called to be put on the waiting list at 6:50PM but were not seated until 9:00PM
However, during the wait, the restaurant manager accomodated us by giving us complimentary bar food and by also giving us excellent service when we were seated
They made sure we were well taken care of
The food was quite good
The egg toast appetizer was delicious and the seared salmon was very good
$25 for 3 course cuisine is unbeatable, even cheaper than restaurant week! Despite the long wait for a table (they have a no-reservations policy, wait list only), we ended up having a great night and will be back
I have been to Kitchen 22 several times with only great experiences
The $25 prix fixe can't be beat and the wine list is also a steal
I laso enjoy grabing a drink and a quick bite at the bar, the sliders are fantastic
My boyfriend took me here for dinner one night and we thought it was great! We were seated immediately and the waitstaff was very sweet
Everything was delicious and the meal was timed perfectly
Definitely worth the money! My only advice is to check the menu before you go
Our estimated 45 minute wait turned into a 75 minute ordeal - when we complained, the host's only response was a mock-apologetic it happens
Once we were finally seated (the last seating, but by no means close to the restaurant's posted closing time), we were rushed through our meal (the check appeared three minutes after the dessert did)
We won't return
Went to Kitchen 22 on a Wednesday night
Restaurant atmosphere was cool
Quiet enough to have a conversation, but not dull
Not really a bar scene either
The food was good, especially for the price
It's a trendy menu and the wait staff is very attentive
Free coat check too!  Would definitely recommend
Good first date or friendly dinner spot
Not too pricey, not overly romantic
Went there last night
Host and waiter were very friendly and polite
We had excellent service
Food was better that average but not fabulous
For the price however it was a great deal
Cocktails were only $7
50, which is a deal for a place like this
The 3 course pre-fix makes it easly to decide and will likely have something on it for everyone
We had 3 people in out party and come dessert time the wiated brought us one of all 5 desserts to same
Definately will go back
I had been looking forward to going here for quite some time and it totally lived up to my expectations
The food was really good and presented nicely
There were good choices on the menu that it was hard to decide what to choose from
The server was attentive as well and friendly
I think it is one of the best deals in NY and I would go back!
They change their menu every week so before you wait the hour plus make sure to take a look
We went on a Friday night, the menu choices were horrible, the food was tasteless and not even worth the $25 price fixed meal
The butterscotch pudding looked and tasted more like mustard than dessert
They had some nerve too, while we were waiting they would not even let us order an appetizer at the bar
I was lured in by the prix fixe deal, but wary since I'd read some of the more negative reviews
My starter was excellent -- a hearty veal crepe that almost could have been an entree had there been two
It was savory and rich, delicious with a glass of merlot
My mustard seed crusted salmon was more interesting than tasty -- a mismatching of small sides (4 small chewy gnocchi) and a carmelized onion/celery dollop
The tiramisu was good, and a nice end to the meal
Wines were a bit on the expensive side, all things considered
The service was fine and friendly enough
We went on a Monday night and didn't have to wait for a table
I might go back
I wouldn't give it an 8 or a 9, but anyone who's rated it as a 1 or a 2 probably has a grudge for some reason
Beautiful interior, friendly service, unique menu, great bang for your buck, good wine selection and a *new* options
Can't beat that in this town

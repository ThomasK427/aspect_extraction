a rare thing for NYC restaurant in this price point
not to be missed
This restaurant has all of the ingredients for a good time - great atmosphere, great food drinks, great space and with all that, great prices too
Service was a little but flawed, (they brought us beers without the glasses brought the main course out before cleaning off the appetizers) but nothing that would ruin your evening
Conducive to larger groups
Anybody who wants to go a nice, trendy yet casual place and wants a menu to please all palettes will not be disappointed
Essex lounge is one of the best places for brunch in NYC
Not only is it a cool spot with great music and ambience (yes it does get a little noisy

but it is in LES
Very trendy spot, what else would you expect?), the service is good too
The food is excellent, I recommend the chicken-apple sausage, (to die for!) and unlimited mimosas! (Well the menu says three per person then there is an additional charge but I haven't seen any of the wait staff count yet
Especially with a large party)
Because the spot is so popular up you may have to wait depending on the number in your party
It is never a ridiculous wait no more than 30 minutes, in the meantime you can chat with your friends and start the week-end off right with a signature drink from the bar! Salut and Enjoy!
went here on a saturday w/ 4 others and had to wait a long time for a table, but the service was polite
energetic atmosphere but too noisy for my taste during brunch
my dish (scallops with potato pancake and mixed greens) was tasty but the scallops had some sand in them
but i recommend the potato pancakes and the french toast
value was about as expected
gets really busy on the weekends but is in a cool area
Food is good, Bar is excellent, great value, nice atmosphere
I would highly recommend
Love this site -- I use it every day for lunch
I especially like the ability to keep a personal list of favorite orders and restaurants
I found the customer service was helpful even on occasions where I've had a dud order
Consider me a repeat customer
They screwed up my order and there was no phone number on their site
I had to submit a form and then they never got back to me! Complete bummer
I've ordered online from other sites and it works fine as long as thet have good custoemr service like seamless web or others but I have to hate on delivery
com
The the service was so convenient and reliable
They have a varieties of menu selections in the area near you which makes it easy and fast with just a few click away!
I recently visited this place
The first thing you should know is that there is no alcohol served at this establishment
So dinner was served with pineapple juice
You can BYOB
The food was ok but definitely nothing to write home about
I had the ropa vieja and was not impressed
I've had better cuban food and because I've had better, I can't recommend this place
If you haven't had really good Cuban food, you probably won't know the difference
The menu does not have much variety
I have dined at the Azucar in NYC (no relation) and the food was so incredibly fabulous that this place pales in comparison
I also think the food is overpriced
Would I go again? No
The truth is there are too many other places that serve exceptional cuban food for me to come back to a place that didn't do it for me
Not worth your time!! The service is horrible, I waited 1 hour and 20 minutes to get my food, I have problaby visit every cuban restaurants in NJ and this one is the worst
I have been going to Azucar for about 5 years and I have never once been disappointed
The traditional Cuban food is refreshingly TRADITIONAL! Delicious and hefty portions are what you can expect
The restaurant decor is 1950's Havana - very romantic
Wonderful! The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable
They accomodated my engagement party (60 people!) and everyone loved it
Although they allow cigar smoking, there is a non smoking section as well
The cigars actually add a certain charm to the place
Highly recommend trying!
What a great place ! The food was phenomenal and our server recommended a perfect bottle of wine with the curries
It was quite a bit noisy though and we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated eventhough we've made reservation earlier before, but the wonderful food and the exceptional service made up for it easely
I can't wait to go back here
Unfortunately the place is too small , so I only be able to visit on special occasion
Had a memorable birthday dinner here
Servers were friendly and accomodating
Food was delicious not to mention the wonderful ambience
Definitely a recomendations to indian food lovers
I have been to Spice Cover many times, and I've always been very pleased
I am in the food business, and this is one of the only places that I return to again and again
The atmosphere is one of the most peaceful and least tacky of any of the places on Curry Row, and the servers always refill water glasses without even being asked
Though I've never brought a boyfriend, I also think it's quite romantic
But it's the food that's exceptional; it's some of the freshest and most delicious Indian food I've ever had
Sunday through Thursday there's a 4 course prix fixe for $9
95 that's a marvel of a bargain
Exceptional
Couldn't use words to describe this place
What else could you ask for from the great services to the deliciously prepared meal paired with a wonderful ambience
It's just a great value to dine out with friends and family
No wonder everyone rave about this place!
no service  bad and cold food  and very pricy  could use a new chef
My roommate and I discovered Spice Cove a few months ago, and we have been going as often as we can for lunch since then
The lunch special is cheap and includes several courses, and everything tastes great! The decor, for the price, beats out the other Indian places on 6th Street, and the waitstaff is very accommodating and friendly
Went for dinner last Sat and was greeted with great hospitality
The waiter was friendly and we were seated comfortably by the window even though the whole place was packed! The food was interesting(it was our first time trying Indian cuisine) and we loved the food for the rich spices and flavor that were used
The crab cake appetizer was amazing, also the cardamon spiced roasted duck salad were incredible
Not to mention when our entree came, which was the lamb bhuna and beef tikka masala were not dissapointing as well
Every dish here was a new experience and the flavors exploded with every bite! We enjoyed the food because it's different and it's obvious a lot of care goes into making each dish unique here
Service was good; food was great
I would definetely recomend this restaurant to everyone and make this place one of our favourites in NYC!
On a street with a slew of Indian restaurants, I definately recommend Spice Cove
The food was delicious, vindaloo was spicy, portions were decent sized-- we were not stuffed, but we were very satisfyed
The $9
95 prix fix is an amazing value! The service was wonderful and the timing between courses was perfect-- we were not rushed, as in many restaurants, but we didn't feel as though we were waiting forever either
Just a great dining experience!!!
The food is AMAZING! With such incredible food and stylish decor, you'd expect the price to be much higher, but the prix fixe lunches and dinners are more than reasonably priced
This is an new exceptional Indian restaurant on Curry row
The food is very good and the service is great
Everyone here is extremely polite and helpful
Plus you also get a lot of food for a very good price
The ambience is very impressive and cozy
Well done! One of my new favourite restaurants in NYC
Had the prix fixe dinner there today for $9
95 and what a deal! Everything from the starters to the dessert was delicious and the service phenomenal
We asked for the table by the open window - very nice on a warm summer's evening

Nice location, nice village space
Everything was fine, the pasta sauce was wonderful -- I think they forgot to cook my ravioli
Probably worth a second look
I posted the 1st review of this restaurant (Perfect Pasta) and I just wanted to let you know that, 1 1/2 yrs later, it is still the BEST pasta in the city
Tonight is Valentine's Day, if you're looking for a great meal by candle light, you've found it!
Any Italian place that can make pasta taste interesting different HAS to be good
This is a great neighborhood staple, or a good place to take a date
Romantic but not overly-so, rustic interior, casual local crowd
Good portions for the price, too
Nothing fancy, but the price is right
For a simple italian dinner out, this is a great choice
When the weather is good, eat outside on the sidewalk
The pasta dishes are great
This has got to be the best place to go for an regular night out
The pastas here are amazing! Al dente perfect, with the perfect amount of sauce
The service is fair and the restaurant is very comfortable
I've never had a bad meal and recommend this place to everyone
I can't stand this dungeon
Who said go when the place is quiet during the day? It's always quiet because it's awful
Located in the middle of bustling midtown and in the middle of a bustling corporate building, the serene atmosphere inside verdict is a welcome change
They had great food, good service and beautiful decor
It reminds me somewhat of an old boys club where investment types talk over major deals and wine but, I throughly enjoyed the experience nonetheless
Definately go for lunch when the place is relatively quiet
The Scene Bringing to light the harmonious appeal of Japanese sushi and Latin ceviche, along with a shared taste for brisk, fragrant drinks, Sushi Samba offers a meeting of cultures that is bright, simple and energetic
Inside the colorful geometric exterior, a full crowd of downtown trendies, international fashion types and unassuming professionals gather in fuzzy red booths and around the central sushi bar
The Food The tantalizing selection of sushi and even finer marinated ceviche includes basics like yellowtail, salmon and fresh crab, and a variety of special rolls
Drink selections encompass over 34 sakes (most by the bottle) and Latin cocktails like the mojito, periodista and special "sambatini," which changes each night according to the fresh fruit and garnishes in the house
Went there for a friend's birthday on July 19, 2006
The service was horrendous
We paid the bill and left
The waitress didn't know what she was doing
She ran after us ACCUSING we owe her $20
She counted the money in front of us 2 blocks down from Sushi Samba Park and found out she calculated it WRONG
How ridiculous is that?   The place was noisy, small and crowded
The food was subpar
I expected better
I could get similar quality at my local sushi restaurant
I DO NOT recommend this restaurant if you want a good time and good food
I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
with all the hype about this restaurant, i'm surprised at how disappointed i was with my experience
the servers continuously tried to rush me and my date, which is extremely unfortunate because they interrupted conversation numerous times
furthermore, the food itself was just blah
the yellowtail ceviche was so-so, being masked with onion and too much soy sauce, it destroyed the flavor of the fish
then, the chirashi was a pathetic attempt at a meal: 6 thumb sice pieces of mixed fish ontop of 6 small beds of rice is not equivalent to $20+
the only good thing about my meal was the beautiful hostess and my sapporo, which was twice as expensive as it should have been
My last day visiting NYC, I went last night to great Thai food ( Tiny Thai ) and today I had lunch at the unique sushi samba restaurant
It was a great lunch again
Great value meal
I was happily surprised by the number of vegetarian options, and by the curteousness of the staff
It was honestly one of my better dining experiences in the city
Great experience-- if you can tolerate the wait for a table and the close quarters
I have eaten here about 10 times, and sampled nearly everything on the menu
I have never had a bad meal or service (on a couple of occasions I waited past my reservation time)
Yes, it's expensive and the room is loud
Mercifully, they have moved the bar next door and added a lounge, where partyers hang out while they wait (imagine the chaos when the bar was located in the corner of the dining room)
But I don't mind a crowd when I am surrounded by happy people (a testament to their skilled bartenders)
If you are looking for traditional sushi, I recommend you go somewhere else
If you are looking for creative sushi, trendy latin/sake themed drinks, and a variety of appetizers entrees, and desserts, make a reservation and bring your credit card
I love this spot, great food, great drinks
The crowd is beautiful, you definitely get an eyeful at this place
The atmosphere can't be beat
The staff is friendly and fun! JD you're the man!
As others have noted this is really latin-japanese fusion, not a sushi place
Unfortunately none of the dishes my companion and I sampled exhibited any fusion at all, but merely a schizophrenic mix-and-match of different cuisines
Yes the sushi was very good, but we paid for that
Coupled with the fact that we were seated just inches away from neighboring parties on both sides made this experience largely forgettable
Don't try so hard to make me feel swanky--work on the fundamentals instead
Its a joke to see all the idiots that walk in and out of this place thinking they are cool hanging out at Sushi Samba
The food is horrible, the scene in done with and washed up
Why don' they put a red carpet with velvet rope outside
All the Hummer-limos can drop them off
It was horrible
All bridge and tunnel crowd
Food was expensive and horrible
Ok, my fiancee and I went here last night
We'd been to the one in Miami before, but our first time to Park Ave location
It was a Monday night and the place was half-empty
The snooty hostess just stared at me blankly when i asked for a table for 2
And then I asked her if there was a wait, and she said yes and tried to sit us at the bar
Then my fiancee spoke up and said no, we'd like to be seated at a table as soon as possible
So then she showed us right away to one of 4 empty tables right in a row
I hate places like this, that give you such an attitude, when they're not even busy
However, the food was very good
I recommend the yellowtail ceviche and the miso chilean sea bass
ok food, high prices, space too crowded
food was little different but not worth the $100+ check
TWO hours for a sushi lunch is crazy! A party of two waited 10 min for a waiter and lunch when the place was empty
Our sushi, which was sitting at the counter for 20 min, came out before the soup and salad
We sent it back and waited another 15 min for the soup and salad
The check took another 20 min to get
For $45 for lunch I COULD NOT believe haow terrible the place is
The food is the olny thing that saved me from freaking out! and the bus boys were the only reeding thing about the place
Constant green tea refills
Thanks for Nothing!
this place is too packed
regardless if you have reservations or not, you still have to wait
which sucks!  overpriced sushi/latin flair
ambiance was alright
drinks are too weak
the food's not bad, but the restaurant is way too small and loud to have any conversation

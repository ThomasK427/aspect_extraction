A'mangiare is a pizza shop/restaurant in Bronxville, NY with a dinner menu of Italian cuisine
I visited the restaurant on 7/24/02
I found the prices to be extremely high in comparison to the portions you receive
I ordered scungilli and calamari marinara over spaghetti which was not listed on the menu
They were available separately at $14
95
I was charged $17
95 for my order which did not come with a salad
It was severed on what can best be described as a very small platter
I have visited many Italian restaurants throughout the years and have received the same order on a large full sized platter with plenty of pasta and always included a salad
I do not recommend dining at A'mangiare unless your accustom to paying a lot for little
Coromandal is the best indian food I have ever had
The service was great and the waiters were knowledgeable about everything on the menu
I went there and had the calamari which was unbelievable and also a fish curry which was also great
I tried this restaurant because it was mentioned in a Westchester Magazine, they said that you had to try the calamari
So i did and all I can say is that this was an unbelievable dinner, you have got to try it!
Wonderful food, the best indian ever
Fresh ingredients, spices are excellent
Great fresh, tasty, authentic Italian food
Not to mention the crispy brick oven pizza
Their bread that they make themselves is also excellent
The price is right for the amount of food given and the quality is among the best
You get Quality and Quantity for a cheep price, can it get any better
A suggestion is try the fish, any kind, it's all fresh and top notch
Excellent for the family
Becareful though you might miss it though because it's on a side street, looks small but it's not
this restaurant excels in all aspects
the food is delicious and a great value
all entrees include soup, salad and a dessert offering flavors that will not dissapoint
all this accompanied by a chef who will undoubtedly make you smile
what more could you ask for?
We went to celebrate a friends b-day @ EDOs
It was great all the chefs come out and sung Happy B-day in Japanesse, gave em a piece of cheesecake and took a group pic
The food was awesome and the chefs put on a great show
You get a great bargain too because they give you an appetizer eentre dessert AND free refills
great place! Cant wait to go back =)
I recently went to Edo's to celebrate a friend's birthday
We had a great time
the chef was awesome! The drinks were great! Be warned though
if your entire party is not there they will not seat you and they will give away your table
Overall a great experience!
We celebrated my cousin's birthday at EDO's on Saturday
The food and service was absolutely fantastic!!!! I can't wait to go back (and I will REAL soon) to eat the great shrimp and lobster!!!
It has everything you expect from this type of Japanese restaurant
The food is excellent and the attentive staff really takes good care of you to ensure a nice dinner
The drinks were a surprise in that they were prepared very well and is more typical of a nice New York City bar
Everyone will have a good time here
Get seated in the rear, and dine on great antipasto
Try any dish and you will be happy, especially the veal
The ambiance could use a pick up but it in Pelham, so what can I say
The staff is very attentive and will treat you right
Friday nights are busy but any day in the week you will not need reservations
We love this place! It's a great neighborhood restaurant, except we don't live in the neighborhood
However, we travel out of our way to enjoy the pizza ambience
The staff keep a constant banter going - great entertainment! The ambience isn't all that fine - an upgrade in the decor wouldn't hurt, but if it changes the recipe it isn't that important
Usually don't write these things but wanted to check out this place before going to my friends rehersal dinner
Since I'm a member checked out this place on this site
After reading one of the reviews didn't know what to expect
P
S
the place is awsome
The food and service were great
I also went to the restaurant's website when I read it was rundown, etc
, They have a really cool website with pixs
The place is beautiful
pics are worth 1000 words as they say
Do the Sauerbraten
My grandmother is German and this was the real deal
My guests and I had a great evening at Gebhardts, from the moment we arrived to the time we left
the staff was very accomodating to all are needs, the food was fabulous with a wide selection of american to the german food that they specailize in
the piano player was also exeptional which also made the evening a relaxing one
I would highly recommend this restaraunt to anyone who would ask
I was recommended to gebhardts, and I am glad I was
from begining to end my family and I had a great time
the staff, the food and the piano player was wonderful
I just thought I would let people know about this restaurant my family highly recommends you should come and enjoy yourself
I went here for my dad's birthday and it was a complete nightmare! We got seated right away but had to wait 30min for a waitress to come by, just for bread! Then it took forever to place our orders and for our food to come out
The bill comes and I noticed extra charges on it
I politely asked the waitress to explain these charges noting that the menu was misleading and she got frustrated mad and then told her manager
Both of them came back to our table and starting raising their voices at me
I dine out a lot and I never had a waiter and manager treat me this way
All they said was that the bill is set and that was it
I was so furious that for the first time in my life, I didn't leave tip
STAY AWAY from this horrible place!
This little Italian restaurant has consistently very good food and great service
It's a little expensive, but has a wonderful feel inside and usually won't disappoint
I guess it's really the people who go to Daruma who ruin the experience
It's loud, obnoxious and just plain Great Neck, but the food is fantastic
I'm a big fan of take-out from there
If you're not a regular, plan on waiting a while for a table
I first heard about Daruma on the news - apparently many celebrities and olympians love to frequent it (I even saw Sara Hughes when I went)
But if that's not enough, the food was absolutely out-of-this-world! I ate at Nobu just two weeks prior, and even their (renowned) sushi didn't compare in freshness and taste
Also, the waitresses were VERY amenable and friendly (ask for Amy if you're worried about this)
The ambiance was quite nice
even the sushi chefs welcomed me! I consider myself to be a sushi connoisseur, and I can truly say that Daruma is the best! BTW
their website is darumaoftokyo
com (though I hear they're soon going to renovate it)
PS
I suggest their Futomaki, Lobster, Fantasy and Spencer Roll!
The food is soso

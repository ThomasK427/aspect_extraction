Everything starts out with bread and a platter of carrots, celery and radishes to munch on
The waiters are donning maroon half jacket and bowties and look as aged as bar
The food is fine but made better by the retro (w/o meaning to be) vibe
It's got a lot of style, is real NYC and sticks to its tradition
Love it
I wandered into this place for the first time a couple weeks ago and have been spreading the word ever since
I don't know who had bad experiences there because every time I go the sushi is terrific, the service is attentive, and the bill is so low you walk out feeling like you pulled one over on New York
They could do a little work on the ambience department, but other then that the place couldn't be more money
If you live in the West Village and haven't tried this place yet you are missing something
Funayama has to be one of the few places in the city that makes sushi large enough to get you full within a few bites
The all you can eat option for only $23
10 is a smart option for those big eaters out there and the sushi is definitely delicious
The service is attentive and constantly checks to make sure everything is taken care of
The interior of the restaurant is nicely lit, surrounded by appropriate decor
Beware, if you don't finish your food, you'll be charged
My girlfriend and I just ate here for the first time
She is a sushi conesseur
I like it A LOT, but I'm still learning
WE BOTH LOVED FUNAYAMA!!! Go for the Mon
Thurs
all you can eat
and come hungry
The sushi pieces are HUGE!! Eel is great
The waiter was cool and told us to take our time so we could get more out of the all you can eat
Plus, the tables aren't too close together
that's something I've been noticing more and more of in NYC restaurants
I left in one of the biggest food comas ever
Good spot
I'm definately going back
I tried the all-you-can-eat-sushi Thursday
The sushi is big
However, the fish is tasteless
The service is very good though
If you are a sushi lover, I don't recommend you to go
For $25 a person you get unlimited access to a huge variety of Sushi
The portions are huge and the quite good
It's not the best sushi in the world but definately good
Eel, Salmon, Tamago (the egg stuff) is all pretty good
The food won't make your heart stop but it'll feeling plenty full and satisfed
Regarding some other postings, I never had a problem when I went
Don't be swayed, I woud def
visit at least once
The one time I went here for the all-you-can-eat special, the service was laughable
It took forever to place an order, and then at least 1
5 hours to actually get some food
The best part was that I ordered eel, saw another table actually get some eel, and then asked where my eel was when my food was brought without any eel
The answer, and I'm quoting exactly, Eel? No more! Hilarious
Whenever I walk by the place, I think, Eel? No more! And also, I don't go in
i went to all you can eat sushi night, and i will definitely come back
they serve monstrous portions of sushi
big enough to eat in 3 portions
their all you can eat menu was very decent
not just tuna and salmon-- you can also order mackeral, yellowtail, halibut
the waiters seem a bit disoriented however
they kept forgetting about our beverages
The best kept secret in NYC
Great food, service, and easy on your wallet
I would recommend this to anyone that likes sushi
My wife actually had me drive two hours the day she gave birth to our daughter to pick up sushi from this venue
If I had to pick one word, I would say yummmmy
Good quality, outstanding value
It won't give you a life-changing experience, but Funayama is a solid neighborhood contributor
I've only gone and will only go for the all you can eat on Monday and Thursday
While they recently raised the price to about $25 per person, if you can eat a decent amount of sushi, it's a great deal
The quality is very good
Not Tomoe good, but still very good
And you can eat as much as you want, picking from about 20 kinds of sushi and 20 or so rolls
The service is fine--the food comes pretty quickly
The ambience is nothing special, but with all that fish you'll be eating, who cares what's hanging on the wall
Yeah, I know, McDonalds doesn't have sushi
But the sushi at this place is terrible
You'd be better off at McDonalds
Dried out fish, so old I could barely chew it
Nasty tasting stuff
I've been eating at Funayama for over a year, and it has never disappointed
They have very inspired rolls (favorites = Winter Greenwich), and the fish is always fresh, and served in large pieces
To the reviewer earlier who mentioned that 'warm' rice and fish are good for bacteria growth, he or she has obviously never been to Japan and has never actually ate good sushi (instead preferring the refrigerated kind), for if the rice is made fresh (as it should be), it will be WARM! Duh
but I digress
If you are looking for a delightful sushi experience in the Village, few others (notable exception: Aki) can compare on freshness and value
The ambience could be better, but go for the fish! And the staff is warm and friendly
I have eaten at Funayama several times with groups of all sizes
Each time, I had an enjoyable experience
The rolls and cuts of fish are large, which is half the test in the all you can eat challenge
If you don't finsh you have to pay for what is left
Since my meals have always been tasty, finishing has yet to be a problem
Service is nice and attentive and management makes everyone feel at home, even during the first visit
Large pieces of fish over huge mounds of warm rice
hotbed for bacteria growth? Manager says that's how they make it here
Left without finishing my dinner
The sushi there were quite big, but they were not that fresh
Also, the fish that they served were low-quality that they were almost tasteless
I would prefer some of its rivals in the district
I love this place the sushi helpings are great the service is wonderful and the eel special is the best in town
Theres no reason to go anywhere else unless there are single men hanging out in the other spot
This place is a MUST eat here ;-)
All my friends know where they can find me on Wedensday nights - Funayama! I can taste my yummy and free! Spicy Crunchy Salmon Handroll now
Funayama's is a really great deal considering the freshness and size of the sushi and sashimi, I simply can't go anywhere else for Japanese food
If you are looking for all-you-can-eat sushi, then try Funayama on Monday or Thursday
I didn't think the sushi was the best I've ever had but it was certainly the best all-you-can-eat
The pick list has some interesting items that differ from most other places (octopus, salmon roe, etc

My husband and I went to Bouley on a saturday night in october
The food was overall really good but variable depending on the choice of the meal, which for such a renowned and expensive place, was unexpected
The service was bad, honestly : we could feel the stress of the waiters coming every 2 minutes to check if we had finished our meal, filling our glaces of water etc I think the management should emphorsize on the importance of being relaxed and show some savoir-vivre more than forcing their staff to fill in glaces etc
The decoration is cosy but lacks of elegance
I suppose that Bouley has since re-vamped their service since the last reader reviews - because I cannot remember the last time I had such great service
We had 4-5 various servers - the manager visited our table several times, and everything was timed perfectly
We got to thank the chef pastry chef personally
The food was incredible - we had the chef choose our menu and everything was so fresh and delectable
Bravo!
while the food was very good, the service was terrible
the staff was unattentive
the waiter never asked if we would like more drinks, we had to flag him down and ask him and then when he brought them he forget two of them
if bouley expects us to pay top dollar for the food, they should offer top dollar service
in my opinion, the poor service ruined what would have been an otherwise wonderful dining experience
I just ate at Bouley
The food was very good, inventive and exciting
However, the service was a bit lacking
I think the food will carry them until service improves, but if it does not, NY diners will not eat there, and the Staten Island set will fill the tables
Yeah
Dined at Bouley for the 4th or 5th time this past weekend
Once again, we were thoroughly impressed
Our only criticim, which is minor, is that it would be nice if they had a few more options on the wine list in the $35-50 range
too many over $80
I have eaten at Bouley several times (Lunch and Dinner) and love the food, service and decor
The food is well prepared; full flavored, a bit exotic, and the presentation appetizing
The deserts are wonderful and creative
This is absolutely my favorite restaurant
The only down side is room is a little bit dark
I was a little apprehensive because of the strict reservation requirements (faxed copy of credit card and $50 per no-shows)
The food was delicious, particularly the duck
Overpriced, but worth it
I had an outstanding experience when I took my parents to Bouley this past Sunday evening
The food was superb, especially the Buttermilk and Black Truffle chicken breast, we commented about this dish the entire next day
It was so moist and full of flavor that we had to ask our waiter to explain the preparation process to us
The desserts were outstanding and the wait staff was informative, friendly and attentive
I recommend this restaurant for anyone who enjoys a complete dining experience with exceptionally good food
Our third visit to the new Bouley proved again that this dependable establishment provides highest quality, very inventive plates at tasting-menu prices that are high but fair under the circumstances
Expect to leave happily satisfied (not stuffed)
Some folks might have found the friendly service a bit too informal, although we found that the pace gave us time to appreciate (and rest between) the courses
We look forward to returning as often as we can find excuses for doing so
We dined at Bouley on Saturday night and it was excellent
The sample appetizers were great and the Sashimi tuna app was also wonderful
But the lobster really convinced me that Bouley is a new favorite! The chocolate dessert was to die for!
we recently went to bouley for lunch on a saturday
$45 prixe fixe, was very well done and enjoyed
HOWEVER
when the bill came and i realized that they charged $16 for a mimosa, i felt a bit insulted
having lived in new york city for a while, i'm used to high priced drinks, but $16 for a non-brand-name champagne drink is absurd
i could see $9 - $12, but $16 really left me feeling a bit mugged
My experience with Bouley Bakery was excellent, as was mine with Bouley
While the dining room looks a bit different, it still offers the same romantic setting
Service is great and, last but certainly not least, the food was amazing
The prix fixe is the way to go; everything is great
We were there for my friend's bachelorette party
There were five of us
The food was great
The service was excellent
The atmosphere was comfortable
We had a very enjoyable evening
I definitely want to go back again!
I've been to bouley a number of times now
I brought my family when they came to town and they understand what fine dining is all about
they were delighted at the ambiance, service and food
I enjoy this place more and more each time
We went to Bouley recently to celebrate a very special occasion, and had a fantastic experience from the moment we arrived
The staff was wonderful and attentive, and every course of the tasting menu was excellent -- be sure to try the lobster with baby bok choy, mango and papaya
The ambiance was very warm and romantic; we will definitely come back
A few girlfriends and I make a practice of enjoying living in New York by dining out a few times a year at the top restaurants in the city
We visited Bouley in December and had one of our top five meals ever! Service was attentive and helpful and not the least big condecending
Food was delectible
Mr
Bouley, who we had the opportunity to meet after our meal, was pleasant and charming to us despite being harried cooking for a full house
We will definitely go back!
Great service--not overbearing, but friendly and patient
The chef sent out several extra dishes for us to taste
after booking reservations at Danube, only to show up and not have any tables available, the Danube somelier graciously called over to Bouley and got us a table for immediate seating
we had no idea what we were in for
the service was excellent -- warm, informative and entirely professional, the wine list beat Danube's hands-down, the food was incredible, and in perfect proportions: delightful appetizers that were only one bite, but what a bite! (so we ordered more), our main courses were perfect (rich and saturated with flavor), and the desserts were palate-blowing, accompanied by excellent ports and followed by dense blasts of espresso
I'm sorry others have had less than stellar experiences here, because we had a wonderful time, and we're looking forward to going back again
thank you, Danube, for overbooking
This is the best meal I have had in the city
Great ambience, wonderful service and amazing food make this place a must try!
I was eager to try Bouley
Booked Saturday for my 11th anniversary
Big Mistake
After 3 confirmations we were still seated at the worst table in my opinion
Menues were shoved in our faces
Had many waiters
Never asked what we wanted for drinks
I had to tell the waiternormally we have drinks before dinner Then our dinner arrived and while tasty, no lie my dish was 4, yes 4 bites
A joke at $ 38 for the plate
Dessert menues were promptly given to us which we turned down
Then an anniversary dessert came out to us
Nice touch but if we were getting a free dessert then why give us a dessert menu?? Had to get up and ask for the bill
Left and went to Carmines Uptown for dinner
If you want rushed, cold, uninterested service, and you are not hungry then this is your place
I booked reservations at Bouley 4 weeks ahead of time for a Saturday night seating
Once, we got to Bouley we were told there would be another 45 minute wait for our table
The restaurant overbooked the seating and there were about 70 people waiting for a table
We didn't sit down until 10

Perfect, Perfect, Perfect is all I can say about this restuarant
The service was speedy and polite, and the food was fantastic!!
It is so good! the food and service is great
the tables are a little too close together
but it never gets too too crowded
after dinner cookies are great too
very yummy
I went here for lunch and got the prix fixed menu
the rissoto was unbelievable and the berry cream sorbet dessert was amazing too
Very good service
From the atmosphere to the cuisine
everything was first class
Aureole is a must try! The lobster is amazing!
I have been going to Sushi Hana for years and recently they redecorated and the place has a funky, Mod feel to it
Kinda neat, and the layout's much better than before
The food is still great and very fresh, and the prices are excellent considering the competition in the neighborhood
This is my go-to place for good QPR (Quality-to-Price-Ratio) when it comes to sushi
If I want uber-fancy, I'll go to Sushi of Gari
For your nightly sushi meal, this is the place
Their lunch special can't be beat either
Sake Hana is connected via the kitchen to Sush Hana
It is by far and away one of my favorite cozy restaurants in the city
You can't see the sushi (or even the person you are dinning with for that matter), but trust me it's fresh
The toro never ever dissapoints
Try and keep this one a secret though, becaue the space in the sake bar is very limited
Grabbed a lunch here on a weekday and it was reasonably priced, well-portioned and generally well-prepared
They had a very nice selection of lunch specials, with a soup and salad included in most cases
The eel over rice was a generous portion and arrived with a side of oshinko (Japanese picked veggies)
The sashimi lunch box had very fresh fish slices, but the included fried dumplings were soggy and plain rice was a bit dried out
Overall, it is a great price for a sit-down lunch
On a nice day, it is great to sit by the large windows
If I lived in this neighorhood, I'd definitely be back even more often
sushi hana's sake bar, sake hana bar lounge sits around the corner from the restaurant, and is a great, little romantic respite on the UES
you wouldn't expect a place this charming to be there but it's a pleasant surprise
it is disarmingly quiet and very, very dark but once your eyes adjust sit back, relax and enjoy your drink
Fresh, tasty sushi EVERY time
Innovative rolls -try the Green Fuji, and the Yellowtail in ANYTHING
They often have good toro as well
It can be crowded and noisy so try to go at an off time
Also good for take-out, but they use lesser quality pieces of fish in the take-out orders, I noticed
Being an out-of-towner this place was easy to get to and parking wasn't a problem (lots of garages around)
On a sat
night (around 8:30pm) the wait wasn't bad at all - only 10-15 mins
The service was prompt and accurate
Wait and other staff was pleasant and attentive
The food deserves a special acknowledgement! Considering the price (average) the rolls and sushi were fresh, tasty and definately did melt in your mouth! Imaginative house specials added to the exotic experience we were looking for!
Better than Haru - and without the wait
A great place to bring out-of-towners
I go to Sushi Hana a couple times a month and I just love the place
Great food, reasonable prices, plus they have a cozy little sake lounge/bar to hang out at after dinner with friends
At Rafina you will find the most authentic tasting Greek fish, appetizers and main courses
I grew up in Greece and know what is real Greek food and what isn't! and this is the real thing
This place is Perfect! If you just moved to the city and you are little pretentious brown hair pony girl who's daddy is paying your rent and want to show the world how well you are doing in the big city, this is the place for you! I went here with my wife this past weekend, and I came to the realization why so many are fleeing the upper eastside
Matter of fact it encapsulates how obnoxious the UES has become
The wait was horrific, the food and service were fine, but the clientele was much to be desired for
Used to be pleasant
Now, unbareable
Management never wrong, even when waiter admits error
Acts as if you should be thankful to not pay for something they didn't provide that was ordered
Small annoyances have grown to complete dissatisfaction
I will go to any backwater nightmarish eating place before i return to this place
Food may be okay, but maintaining my dignity is more important
My first impression of Annie's was quite different from my second
The first time, I found the popcorn shrimp to be nothing special, and the pasta to be a bit bland
The second time, however, over a New Year's Eve dinner, I was quite impressed with my sea diver scallops and risotto
The atmosphere is lovely; twinkling white lights and a cozy feel
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone searching for sophisticated comfort food!
We had dinner at around 9PM on a weekday and were surprised that the restaurant (which is warm and inviting) was filled
The sevice (while the room was full) was less than stellar, but once half the room emptied, the service was much better
As for the food, everything we ordered was phenomenal: taste, presentation, creativity, etc
The wait staff is/was very accomodating when they were able to keep up with demand, and while Annie's isn't cheap eats the food was wonderful and the prices are fair
Very creative, tasty and worth a visit provided the room is less than half-full
Annie's has creative and fresh food
The brunch is better than any other in the city
The service is always friendly and prompt
This American Bistro is fantastic and not at all a diner
Say what you want, the service may be a bit slow, but only because every table is full for brunch
Why is it so packed? Because this restaurant offers HANDS DOWN THE BEST BRUNCH IN NEW YORK
If you don't go, you are 100% missing out
Only Saturday and Sunday have crowds, so if you can make it in there on weekday, definitely do so
Brunch is served every day until three (AND their best dish, in my opinion, the garden omelette, is on the dinner menu as well)
Dinner menu is good as well, perfect for a home-cooked meal away from home
Annie's is a good diner, the service is extremely slow, but the food is pretty good
I don't mind waiting for a table as the bar tenders pour a strong drink, and the Bloody Mary Mix is nice and spicy
Have ordered from them a few times, food takes forever arrives cold, I don't order any more
The tables are right on top of each other, the service is terrible, but the food is pretty good once it arrives
I've been to Annie's numerous times for brunch and have always been very impressed
The service can be a bit slow, but it's to be expected of a popular brunch spot
But, the food is excellent and the ambience is cozy and charming
Yes, there is a wait sometimes, but the comfortable atmosphere and french toast make up for it
A lot of the peolpe who dine here are repeat customers and there is a reason for it
Not sure where all the people who wrote bad reviews were eating at but it couldn't have been at Annie's
Food is hands down the best breakfast food in NYC and the service is great
very friendly wait staff
I've never had a problem
And yes the wait can be long but Sunday brunch is popular in NYC - you have to know when to go
Recently visiting the city on business I stumbled upon Mon Petit
Its easy to see why loyal regulars, international visitors, and faithful new patrons visit this exquisite classic French restaurant with superior cuisine, service, and charming ambiance
Whether you choose to sit outside or inside, you will feel as if you have dropped in on a cheerful party at home with close friends
In my opinion, Mon Petit is just that special, local place in the city that you keep coming back for more

It was amazing
My friend had eggplant parmesan, just as excellent
The service was great
Our waiter was very pleasant, outgoing, and in fact
cute! The price was so reasonable especially considering the quality of the cuisine and service
Can't wait to go back!
Sorry to post a negative comment on what was one of my favorite Chelsea restaurants
The reliably good food was overshadowed by the awful service on a recent visit
The place was not full, yet they were rushing us through the whole meal
Waiters and busboys were taking our water glasses and the tip tray off the table before we had counted the change
When I commented to my dinner date about the tip try incident, the waiter overheard me and confronted me about my attitude, in front of my date and other diners in the restaurant
We got into a heated argument and he actually told me to get out
It's such a shame that the bitchy wait staff has ruined what was otherwise a great value
As a former waiter, I know that some customers are a pain, however, yelling at a customer is simply not acceptable
We were looking for another alternative to our favorite local Italian, so we tried here one weeknight
The plalce itself is quite small, in a good way
The service was fine
We went for the specials and I enjoyed a nice Artichoke Ravioli that for the price was a good deal
But, the buzz kill was the check
There was an item called Sug
Grat
added to the tab at the bottom
This Suggested Gratuity was already included in the total
Mind you, we were a party of two, not ten
It also did not indicate that the suggestion was added in at 20%
When I questioned it, I was told I could re-calculate it by myself at any percentage I wanted -- fairly inconvenient and overall foolish
I have never seen a restaurant bill in this fashion
That was a deal killer for us
I've been to Cola's only once, but I've had enough dining experiences to know a good restaurant when I dine in one
This is a fine example of great restaurant management: great menu, super friendly servers, and great food at great prices
I had a great dinner my first time there and will definitely return many more times
and pass the word along
Surprisingly good food, very reasonable prices, comfortable atmosphere - in Chelsea? Amazingly - the answer is yes!
I have lived in Chelsea for the past 8 years and have been going to Cola's for the past 7 years
What an amazing and cute little restaurant! The food is great - always consistent and service is wonderful
The liguini vongole is amazing and the fish is always fresh
You will not be disappointed as they aim to please
The Scene The long retro-decorated space seems almost like two rooms: a lively window section and the more formal back area
The bar, adorned with two golden viceroys (men in service to the king), is hopping with Chelsea singles during happy hour
Couples and families stick towards the back of the restaurant
During warmer weather, there's some of the most plentiful outdoor dining in the city along 18th Street
The Food Viceroy is known for its sirloin burgers, which are juicy and monstrous
Most of the entrees are flavorful, particularly the gazpacho and wholesome turkey meat loaf
However, the lobster potpie may be overly buttered
People also flock here for weekend brunch which includes staples like fish-and-chips and roasted turkey with mashed potatoes
All brunch entrees are paired with a complimentary beverage
For dessert, the amazingly juicy green apple sorbet is a popular finish
we went to this restaurant twice, first time for drinks and second time for drinks and a couple of appetizers
the first time, we sat down at the tables outside, waited for 10 minutes for service
when it became apparent no one was coming we went to the bar and ordered our own drinks
the second time, we were seated inside at a table by the window, were given menu's by the host, poured some water and then we waited for at least 10 minutes, no one came to take our order (drinks or food), it wasn't busy, there were waiters hanging around at the serving stations
would not go back there
I had dinner here and when we first entered the amazingly decorated space we were greeted by an extremly fun host, cute too! We wanted to sit outside, and we were promptly taken to a table
The seating could have been more comfortable, but who cres we were cruising eighth avenue! The server came to us and was sooo hot, he went over the menu and specials with us
We ordered the infamous frozen cosmos and they were perfect! For dinner I had the grilled chicken and my friend had some tuna dish
My grilled chicken was delicious and my friends tuna was amazing
Our food came out quick, and the frozen cosmos went down quicker
Overall we had a great experience here, and the staff was HOT and FUN!
I've been to Viceroy many times as it's in my neighborhood and over the years the quality of the food has just gone down so far that I'll sadly cross it off my list of local places to eat
The space is great - roomy with a beautiful wood bar, but the food is just tasteless
I've only had bad service there one time, ironically, when the restaurant was making an 18% tip mandatory
!!! They have sinced abandoned that policy, but the quality of the food will keep me away
this place was the worst for service
i live in chelsea and love the people around me in my neighborhood
i went to this place for brunch and felt like i was being ignored
i will never go back to viceroy
they did not ever serve me what i ordered
It's sad b/c the space is very enjoyable -- however when it came time to bring out the dishes the waitress told me oh yeah, we ran out of that dish - do you want to order something else SHE WAITED UNTIL THE REST OF THE GROUP ALREADY HAD THEIR FOOD! There is no reason a restaurant with such poor service should be able to survive in NY
The oinly good thing: I tried all of my friends dishes, and I would say that one would have to go very far away from Manhattan to find food this bland
I guess I should be happy to have saved the cost of an entree
Oh, and the waitress was angry that we only left a 10% tip --- we were very generous!
Not bad for a lunch
I had a chicken ceaser salad that big for 14
95
I also got a tea, OJ and muffins
Definately a good deal
I had alittle wait but you'll feel good after your done
It s also very roomy
This place is perfect for a Saturday Lunch or Sunday Brunch with friends
Food is decent
The atmosphere and ambience and warm and wonderful
Greast mixed crowd
And the patio seating is perhaps the best in Chelsea
Some service improvements would put this place over the top
Not what it used to be
Viceroy used to be a great place to hang out with friends, eat some ok food in a really nice and comfortable atmosphere
The bartenders were terrific as were the waiters and so was the crowd
NOT ANYMORE! All the great bartenders are no longer there, the waiters stink and the crowd has gotten really dumpy
Food has always been just ok and it still is - it's not worth going anymore!!! iT'S OVER
Viceroy's the perfect lunch spot -- the tables aren't too crowded together, the service is good, and the lunch offerings are excellent, particularly the salmonburger (wonderful) and the salads
Dinner's a bit more hectic, and more pricey (though less so than in most nearby bistros), but still pleasant
The Scene The energy is warm, easy and pleasant--everyone is having a good time, and the feeling is palpable
In the front bar, boisterous neighbors and friends share bottles of wine; the large dining room, with its lovely painted ceiling and oversized portrait of a portly chef, is the destination for serious eating
The Food Pizzas are nothing short of excellent--perfectly charred, with a bend-y, thin crust
Pair them with a simple salad, such as grilled onions drizzled with olive oil, or arugula with sweet balsamic onions and Parmesan
Pasta lovers may be a bit disappointed: While the hefty bowls of pasta are fine, both the penne gratin and the pappardelle with lamb ragu taste like they're missing something
Among entrees, the porcini-crusted bass and the braised short ribs are standouts
And if you manage to leave room for dessert, the classic ricotta cheesecake is a very good choice
I had dinner on Monday night at Gonzo and thought it was worthy of the great reviews that other diners had given it
That's why it was suprising me to read the last review

or one with better selection of traditional Happy Hour food (four choices)
Neither food nor value are particularly good
They are friendly and try hard, but you can do better without going very far
My wife and I found this wonderful restaurant and had lunch
The service was perfect
The food was excellent and well priced
We felt at as if we were regulars here
Thanks for a lovely afternoon
i rellly enjoyed this restaurant because the waiters are really friendlyand you fell as if you were home there
I really recommend it to the people who read this
Iguarantee it will be the best food you will ever try
I would say it is the best food in town
There is not much ambience to the place but the sushi is fantastic!! I have eaten at may sushi places in the city and this place has the freshest fish at the best prices
What they lack in creative rolls they make up in the quality of the food
There is never a wait and atmosphere is low key
Good for those on a budget or just want good food
In Short Push through a crush of red velvet and enter this contemporary bistro, with its red-trimmed facade, antique lace curtains, polished wood floors, poster-lined walls and stylish crowds
The glass-enclosed kitchen turns out re-invented classics, like mussels gratin with a julienne of vegetables and light curry sabayon, roast chicken with mashed potatoes and chestnuts, lobster and artichoke gnocchi and slow-roasted pork shoulder with carrots and fennel
Food is incredible, service is stellar, and it's an all-around AWESOME place
Cozy, romantic feel to it
Great for a special occasion
In winter, I don't recommend sitting by the window - there's a serious draft
But the food made up for it
Mushroom ravioli is to die for
After 7pm, easy to find parking on the block
Make a reservation in advance
I hadn't been to Park Bistro in a long time, but was thrilled to find that it had changed owners
The decor was beautiful yet cozy, the staff - from the hostess to the chef who visited our table - were attentive and charming - but oh - the food! The Coq au Vin was to die for, so were the fish dishes
And their desserts were wonderful
French fare with a Meditteranean influence
A perfectly enjoyable dining experience
Highly recommended
Very attentive service - pleasant yet elegant
Nice attention to detail in the food
Seemed to use nice quality ingredients
One of the best of the French restaurants in town
Don't miss dessert
I only had two complaints: they didn't crumb my table and I had to look at bread crumbs through dessert
Lemon tart was delicious, but in Paris they would have used a touch of flame to give it a crispy carmelized top
Prix fix menu looks to be a good value
The atmosphere is very comfortable and cozy
The food was pretty good, but I don't recommend the duck(Overcooked)
Within walking distance from the Westminster (and anything else in MSG) and quite a find
Hangar steak like Paris (and highly recommenced)
Spanish influence in some dishes
Left bank bistro atmosphere; however, wine significantly overpriced and a disappointment for a French restaurant/bar
I guess the other positive reviews must come from the owners of the restaurant
My experience at Rungsit II was lousy
Two of my friends ordered chicken Pad Thai, which turned out mushy and visually disgusting
Another dish came with mexican yellow rice instead of fried rice
The service didn't help either
With a 9
0 rating, I'm concerned at the quality control to which the scoring is determined
I was looking for a reasonably priced restaurant with good food, and boy did i find it at Rungsit! They had really great Thai food at a cheap price
I got the pad thai with shrimp
yum! The restaurant had a nice atmosphere
The service wasn't great, but that might have been because we got there just before they closed
Very nice meal for a very decent price
The service was great! The waitress was very helpful and made good suggestions for our entrees
The food was served promptly but the meal wasn't rushed - we had plenty of time to enjoy the appetizers and our entrees as well as sit and chat while finishing up our drinks even after we paid
The ambiance isn't fancy, but still relaxing and pleasing to the eye
I will definitely go back
This is one of the finest inexpensive Thai restaurants I have been to in NYC
I have lived all over the world and this is still at the TOP
Good quality meats, freshly cooked, top spices
For both dine-in and take out!!! I highly recommend!
This Thai restaurant offers yummy food in a cute and cozy atmosphere
I dined here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night, and we were very pleased! I think this is an ideal place for a date, if you enjoy Thai food!
I have on limited trips to NYC had the opportunity to eat and recommend others to eat at this location
In fact it may be my favorite restaurant in America
Owners are hands on and caring, food is good, ambiance is tremendous
Overall it just makes for an enjoyable dining experience
Yes, it may be geared more toward the more elder crowd
But I can assure you that if the old heads like me go back again and again it is good
Because it is not inexpensive with an early bird special
No one that has gone there upon my recommendation has ever come back with a bad report
I am just sad that they are not located in my home of Nashville, TN
My girlfriend and I had dined at Villa Berulia on 10/17/05
The atmosphere and service were excellent, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the food
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either
I've read other reviews saying how bright the place is and I don't agree
I found it comfortable and cozy
I've also read how it's for the 'older crowd'
I suppose people over 40 need a place to go too
but I would go there no matter my age
I have gone to Villa Berulia since it first opened
Everytime we go to the city, we could have the pick of fine Italian Restaurants, yet, we always choose Berulia
Everyone that we have reccomended a try are never dissapointed
My daughters were young in age and they remember and now have gone with their husbands
John and Maria are fantastic hosts
Keep up the good work
His staff is great and wonderful people
I live and work in the Murray Hill area and can tell you that this is by far the best italian restaurant in the neighborhood
The fish and meats are the freshest in town and they will prepare your dish anyway you like, no questions asked
The vodka sauce and the tiramisu are the best in the city
The service is also the best around
This place will cater to your every whim and desire
It's understanable why this place has been around for such a long time
This place is how restaurant service used to be in New York City
The minute you walk in here, the attention given to the customer is immpeccable

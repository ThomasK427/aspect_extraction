The space is full of beautiful and normal people, lively and worth any wait
A group of my friends gathered at La Bottega last night for a birthday celebration
we were all disgusted with the service
The bus boy spilled water on 4 out of the 6 people in the party and was irritated when we asked for additional napkins
The hostess had such an attitude problem that she literally threw our coats at us at the end of the night
saying that they do not usually bring peoples coats to the table
This was only after another staff memeber had taken our coat check tickets from us while we were still seated
The server was pleasant and was constantly apologizing for the behaviour of the others
The bottom line is the food is good, the atmoshpere is great, but with attitude like that we certainly will not return nor recommend this restaurant
It is unfortunate because it does have potential to be a great
The place is adorable
fabulous ambience, decor, lighting
but they need to work out some kinks or this restaurant will stumble fast
The service was truly abominable - I made a reservation and when being seated next to a service area, I asked to sit at a different table
I was told that that table was reserved
I explained that my table had been reserved two weeks in advance, but they refused to accomodate
My food was excellent, but my friends' dishes were all too salty
Our waitress disappeared for lengthy periods of time so that we were forced to repeatedly ask the bus boys to help us
It really was a terrible disappointment - and a shame because the restaurant has the potential to be a great hot spot
This joint is completely overpriced and lacking in service
Perhaps that's why it's empty
Martinis are $12 plus tax
Beware the automatic 20% service fee at the tables
I guess that's levied because otherwise the servers would not get any tips
On the night we were there, the heat seemed to be on overdrive and we fled from the room like rats from a burning ship
The Scene The 12,000-foot franchise, with its countrified, distressed-wood bar, framed "Gump"-isms and stellar view of Times Square from its tourist-trafficked tables upstairs, is chock-full of movie memorabilia
Framed still images from the film line the walls, and Depression-era props perch on shelves
Smiling servers quiz diners with movie trivia, but forget to fill their water glasses
The Food Popcorn shrimp, peel-and-eat shrimp, shrimp po' boys--practically every Southern-style preparation Bubba ever conceived is available here, in huge portions for not much money
Kids will love the "Bucket of Boat Trash": crisp-fried, mild mahi and golden shrimp, spicy hush puppies and extra-long fries in an aluminum pail
Grown-ups should try oversized coconut-fried shrimp with sweet-tangy citrus marmalade, or ultra-fresh peel-and-eat shrimp boiled in beer
But stick with crustaceans: Fried chicken arrives dry, ribs lack flavor and clam chowder tastes very little like clam
Well, I've always loved the movie Forrest Gump, and when I found out about this restaurant, I just had to try it
I dragged some of my friends here, and we're all glad we went! I think this is a wonderful restaurant
The seafood was delicious, and the drinks were excellent! It may be a bit pricey, but sharing can solve that problem since the portions are huge! Our server was hilarious and very attentive to our needs
The trivia was great, and my friends and I answered every single question correctly! I had such a blast, and I look forward to coming here again!
IF you like Forrest Gump, you have to come here for lunch
Get the strawberry lemonade
Prices are good an it looks over Times Square
I fell in love with Bubba Gump's
I absoutely love everything, their food is amazing, especially the mahi mahi or the steak
The wait staff was great! I would recommend this restuarant to anyone and everyone!
my husband and i went to times square as soon as we got to new york and were famished
we were seated immediately, but were slightly dissapointed that we were put on a table at the back and didn't get as good a view as we wanted but that was the obly downfall
service is good although a bit in your face, we were asked every five mins if food was ok, but better that than being ignored
food arrived quickly and was hot and v good, just don't be on a diet if you are going to eat here as no real options for slimmers!! only thing that put me off is all staff join in to sing their version of happy birthday (which happended three times near our table!) so lots of noise, light hearted and fun but slightly cringeworthy for a brit!
it's a theme restraunt, so you have to expect that its going to be busy, noisy and more expensive than it's worth
It's fun though, the waiters are friendly, the clam chowder is pretty good, it's mild, like new england clam chowder is, the crab cakes are pretty good, the fish and chips are yummy, the drinks are expensive, as are all drinks in times square area
great for kids, forrest gump fans, and people that know what to expect
we went here cause it was late at nite (1AM) and were hungry after final exams on a friday night
So what the heck
We saw the combo deals in the window thinking the price should be reasonable
So we trotted inside
The ambiance was average
,, looked a little like a tgi fridays (i would have given the ambiance lower score however out the window was a view of times square) now onto the food
Small portions, we ordered the burger and chicken + seafood platter
the food was a notch above average but certainly not worth the $$$ (average about $14 a platter)  my friend ordered a mixed drink - unlisted on the drinks menu - which they did not know how to mix properly
the staff was friendly and festive
but overall its a tourist joint
i wouldnt not recommend blowing your money here
At noon on a Saturday we were told the wait would be 45 minutes; it was closer to 55 minutes
Once we were actually seated the overall experience was ok
Prices are what one would expect for Times Square, meaning they were way overblown with respect to what you get
Burgers and sandwiches run about $10+ and most entrees were right around $20
The quality of the shrimp was pretty good; anything non-shrimp, including some of the seafood isn't really worth your time
The staff was friendly but busy
In a city filled with much of the world's best food I can't understand how a place like this thrives the way it does
If you're going to spend over $20 per person, use a few of those dollars to go to another part of town and get a delicious meal
My boyfriend is a big spender so the prices didn't bother us any
The food was really good
He said his burger was dry but what did he expect for a seafood restaurant?! I had the item that they forgot to put on the menu; some very tasty fish over jasmine rice with shrimp
Deelish
The waitress was very sweet and entertained with some Forrest Gump trivia
She got me when I had to name the hurricane (Carmen)
But I got her back when I asked her to name Bubba's very last shrimp dish (the shrimp sandwich)
The wait for the food was a little long, but well worth it
I had a really great time and would go again in a heartbeat!
I went here during summer 04 and I thought the restaurant was great
Its relaxing, somewhere you can go with your friends for a good meal and good company
All these people who are complaining about the food and service are forgetting that it isn't the Ritz
I love to go out and eat at a place where I can relax and just have a few laughs with friends
The service was fine and the food was great
I had the bucket of trash which was awesome!!!!!! The atmosphere is great and fun!!!!! For a good meal and a good time, check out Bubba Gump Shrimp Company
I have to say this place is virtually no different than any other place big chain restaurant -- touristy, expensive, and downright crowded
Its practically a TGI Friday's with a seafood influenced menu
However, the food was actually a lot better than I expected
The appetizers were delicious, the entrees were plentiful, just overpriced
My bowl of pasta + (small) shrimp was a mere $21
95
The service was ok, but slightly pretentious
What was amusing was the incredible memorabilia of Forrest Gump stuff and southern items showcased all around the restaurant
This is also one of the few places where you can signal a wait person by switching a license plate to red for stop!
My wife and I dined here one evening while walking around the Times Square area
We had a wonderful table that was right next to the glass window/wall, which provides an incredible view of Times Square, since it is on the 2nd level
The service was pretty good, and the seafood was above average
Overall, it was an enjoyable and tasty meal
It is open late, which was nice considering that some of the other restaurants in the area close earlier than I would of thought
If youre out about in Times Square late in the evening and get hungry, this is a good place to go and have a good meal while enjoying the view of Times Square all lit up at night
I've been to many a Times Square tourist trap over the years and have been predictably disappointed by most of them
Bubba Gump's isn't bad

We Schlepp from uptown dying for the experience at least once a week
Summer-Outside seating a must!!! The Apt
Mussels are my Fav
the Fish dishes are the best
My husband LOVES the Lamb
Oh- The scene is't that bad either! This place is A MUST!!! TRUST ME I'M A FOODIE!
Which is exactly what I said to Mr
Silvano as I walked out of this place the other night
Yet another cash extraction machine posing as a restaurant
As a long-time New Yorker, I am ashamed to have been conned into frequenting this trap
wow, the food is amazing and the service is great! I will be returning to dine at DaSilvano
I know it sounds crazy but my husband and I always go here after a big night of drinking and eat the penne arrabiata
He gets it with veal meatballs and I just pile on the parmesan cheese
It's spicy and delicious
We always feel 100% cured of our hang overs after the meal
Great food!!
you must sit and look at the menu immediately otherwise leave
i asked if i could have a minute to look at the menu and the waiter told me NO as did the manager
they do not explain any of their specials which are in italian
i dont care what celebrities have been seen here, this was by FAR the worst service for such a limited menu of food i have ever seen
PLEASE do not waste your time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
foodwise i cannot complain because i never actually was able to eat
they did not let me read the menu because apparently their policy is read and eat and leave
not only was the waitor rude and unaccomadating but the manager as well
if i am in that much of a rush i will go to burger king where i will get better service for my money
honestly the worst experience i have had
Fairly prompt seating, although it was a slower rainy night than usual
We were seated and asked whether we want sparkling or still water
Never asked if we wanted wine or beer
We had to ask for a bottle of Prosecco and then had to ask again for a second bottle later in the dinner
The chalk board with specials was presented with no explanations
It is in Italian so luckily we had a couple people at our table that had a rudimentary understanding of Italian
Appetizers were brought and main courses almost right after
We had appetizers left on our plates and were asked if we wanted to finish that? The poor rushed service ruins the entire experience
The food is actually pretty good in general, and certain items very good to outstanding
I pity Bar Pitti
I am always in Italy for business and it toke me a while to find the perfect outdoor space to eat my Sat/Sun brunh with my husband butb i finally got it ! The food is real simple nice well presented and the wine list very very moderate
I really like this place and hope to can go back more often
Went to bar pitti for a friends birthday
the place was crowded and loud, and the lighting and decor made us feel less like we were in an authentic italian restaurant and more like we were in starbucks
the food was mediocre at best
the menu is very meat heavy and the pasta was just ok
do NOT get the chicken pate
it was inedible
the service was fine, though messy at times, and the reading of the specials was extremely fast and hard to understand
overall, was not an extremely pleasant experience
there are much better italian restaurants in NYC
After my wife had a reaction she has with MSG, I inquired as to whether they use MSG
I was shocked to find out they use Knorr broth cubes in just about all the dishes
The waiter, who seemed to be Italian checked with the kitchen and confirmed they do use the MSG laced Knorr cubes
He seemed to think it was ok to do so
Hard to believe in this day and age
The atmosphere was so incredibly warm and happy, and a little bit loud
The food was just so yummy (got the insalata toscano for appetizer and rigatoni pitti for entree)
it was a great size--not ridiculously large like most places, but just enough to leave you quite full
service was very pleasant too
and the prices are so affordable considering the quality of food
fun place
good food!
The pasta is amazing
Entrees start at $10
The wait is sometimes long, but its worth it
Get the Rigattoni Pitti
The only drawback is that it's cash only
Luckily, there are ATM's right around the corner
Before going out to eat, we reviewed this restaurant and found some of the comments on the service concerning, however we decided to try it
I found the seating prompt
The wait staff were very friendly, even explaining the specials of the day in detail, the atmosphere was positive
The food was plentifull and delicious
I would recommend to all
Bar Pitti came highly recommended to me, so this was a disappointing experience
Excellent food, but the service was unbelievably bad
I was being generous by giving a 12% tip
They just couldn't be bothered--obnoxious service
They didn't bring bread (whereas everyone else had bread--is it customary in NYC to ask for bread??), they didn't refill my iced tea, they weren't polite about setting down plates, and you couldn't even get grilled chicken added to pasta--meatballs only
Moreover, they don't accept credit cards and they were nasty about it! What restaurant in this part of NYC doesn't accept credit cards? Am I in Vermont or NYC?
The service was HORRIBLE
Our waiter (who also seemed to be the manager) dropped red wine all over me the contents of my purse and all he did was apologize quickly, hand me some club soda and avoid me for the rest of the time I was there
The food is also below average
NEVER, ever go there
Like most people said, the food here is great - authentic Italian with a sense of uniqueness by vieiwing the expanded menu on the blackboard
However, service here is really mixed
Since they are beyond busy, we had 2 waiters serving us during lunch
One was nice and friendly who did not mind translating the Italian menu and answering our questions
The other one was a total 180: since the place is cash only, we put down $40 for our $30
89 lunch and was expecting changes
20 mins passed and still no sign of getting our changes
When we asked about it, we got a loud announcement of they want their change, which everyone around us could here - ridiculous! Anyway, food wans't bad, serivice depend on your luck, and by the way, the plate and utensils
might want to wipe them before using
I was so looking forward to eating at Bar Pitti, i had heard great things
But from the second we sat down, the waiters were trying to get us out of the restaurant
we were asked for our order within minutes, and i was on a date, so clearly not in a rush
The waiter was completely obnoxious when we asked what he recommended and gave complete attitude about having to translate the specials from italian to english! I would not go back
I have always enjoyed the simple food at Bar Pitti
The pasta is very good, especially the dishes with cream sauce
The penne with turkey sausage and peas is quite deliciouso
The other dishes are all very good and taste home-style
The service, as others have suggested is fair, the servers do all they need to make you have a nice meal, nothing more
THey have delicious bread to start you off (which is a nice little treat while you wait)
Lastly, if you do not speak Italian, you should ask that they read you all the specials of the day, sometimes they are hidden little gems

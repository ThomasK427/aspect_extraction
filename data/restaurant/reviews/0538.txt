I ordered Seafood Ravioli and it was excellent
I totally recomend this place in the heart of gay Chelsea!
The food was very fresh and atmosphere very friendly and casual
Usually you'd have to go to Astoria for Mediterranean food like this
Highly recommend the seafood!!
My friend and I love the grilled calamari
It's so good we were cravying for more
The Nisos salad was just blend no taste at all
I don't recommend it
We also had a Reb snapper with lobster sauce
It was just okay nothing special about it
If you're planning to visit that restaurant, I would strongly recommend having 2 appertizers instead of a full meal
The Grilled Calamari was excellent; a pretty big portion
The fish was kind of dry, the server didn't even ask how I wanted my salmon cooked which was a bit on the dry side
The veggies were fresh and tasty
My friend had the snapper which was a bit too crispy for his tastes
Next time we'll stick to the Calamari and a house salad
With all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quaility and atmosphere
If you like seafood and/or Greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things
I love to mix and match diferent types of foods so the Greek Apitiser sampler is a wonderful counter to say grilled Tuna or a stuffed chicken brest
I have been going to this place since it opened and have never had a bad meal or service
It is a little pricier than the other stops on 8th so I don't go all that often but it is still a good value and I would highly recomend it
I came to this restaurant (which is a little fancier than your everyday casual place) after playing pool
I was with three other people and we were dressed down
I was still seated promptly and was given great service
We ordered about five dishes betw
the three of us, all of which were terrific
Went here yesterday for a quick bite to eat and sorely regret it
We ordered Yaki Udon and the Spicy Maki combo
The sushi was not fresh at all and the unfresh taste of stale fish penetrated into the rice
The Yaki Udon was soggy and did not have any pan fry texture at all
To top off this disgusting culinary mistake, they served canned pineapple for dessert
The pineapple had obviously been sitting in an open tin for at least a day because it tasted extremely tinny
This was the worst dining experience I've ever had in the city
I'm surprised this place is still open
I still have a gross fish aftertaste in my mouth
Been there twice -- regretted it both times
The first time I had udon, which was simply bad
I have been to Japan twice and and eat noodles from reputable Japanese restaurants frequently
This barely qualified as Japanese food
The second time, I ordered only appetizers, thinking they could not mess those up
I was wrong
Even the miso soup was bad -- seaweed was not properly re-hydrated, the whole thing was way too salty, and they served it with a spoon
The tofu salad consisted of iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, and 4 slabs of slimy tofu with a crappy carrot ginger sauce on the side
It looked and tasted bad
To top it off, the spicy tuna roll was simply inedible
It tasted like a sponge
If it were not bad enough already, the tea was lukewarm
I will not make a mistake in going here again
this place looks like your run of the mill sushi place that you see all over new york but they've got a fantastic chef that pull together sushi that will hold it's own against blue ribbon, bond st
etc
My wife and I have been here at least a dozen times and never once been disappointed
Outstanding and orginal sushi at great prices
I went to this tiny restaurant with a party of 12 (I was surprised they could fit us in the restaurant) and I thoroughly enjoyed it
It was very easy to have a family-style meal here with the chicken combos, and everything tasted great
We had so much food we could hardly finish it all, and when the bill came we were all shocked at how little we had to pay
Since it's so small be sure to call in advance if you have more than 2 people (we were a bit squashed anyway), but come with empty stomachs!
This is rotisserie chicken in the Peruvian style
Everything else pales before the chicken and the green sauce
I love the fact that the chicken isn't dried out and tasting like a mouthful of sand like many other rotisserie joints
The chicken here is usually moist and juicy, even without the green sauce
Then there's the Inca Cola
At first I thought it was an inside joke then I began to develop a taste for it
Decent sangria
Since eating chicken is usually a messy business, I mostly get it delivered rather than eating there and either leaving a lot behind or looking like caveman at feeding time!!!
party of 3 after 50 minutes of waiting we were told the next table was ours
the place is small, you can either wait by the wall, people bumping into you or outside in the street
A table of 4 was leaving
We proceeded to the table but were told that was not for us
that was for 4 people who came well after us
For us they were preparing a small table of 2 and pushed an extra chair to it
(facing the kitchen and bathroom) They refused to give us the table for 4
After 50 minutes of wait we left disgusted
Customer service at this restaurant is worst than bad
We also spoke to the manager, to no avail
Do not bother if you want to have a nice evening
it is not worth putting up with this kind of rudeness
So much food for so little money - and it's delicious, particularly the addictive green sauce
Delivery is reliable, although sometimes slow becuase it gets busy
But Pio Pio is well worth the wait!
My husband and I can't get enough of Pio Pio
Their roasted chicken is excellent and we love the hot green sauce that comes on the side
We also like the avacado salad
It's one of our take-out staples because of the good food, fast delivery time and the cheap price (for under $25 we have a dinner for 2 and with left-overs)
We have also enjoyed eating-in the restaurant which is cozy and cute
This place is gret for a first date, or a night out with your frineds, especially if you are paying
The menu only has a few items on it, but everything on there is good
I would try the Sangeria-- the perfect mix of getting drunk without losing it
Good place to take children
P
S
Try to go during off peak hours for optimal pleasure
All locations can come with an hour wait during their peak times
This is a one-of-a-kind Peruvian restaurant
We only tried fish dishes
It was very fresh and they serve a lot
The restaurant is not so big, yet the ambiance makes it very cosy and makes you feel like you are in Peru
The service is fast, and with no thing to not like it makes this restaurant EXCELLENT! The only negative experience was that the waiter didn't offer any desert in contrast to the variety of deserts they have
I ordered half a chicken for delivery which should cost $4
They send me a combo dinner that costs $18

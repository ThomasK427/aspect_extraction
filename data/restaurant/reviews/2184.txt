The best service I've ever had
Funny, outgoing, attentive staff, awesome cuts of meat, strong cocktails, great atmosphere you can actually have a conversation in
That's what you're paying for
If the prices are too high for your liking, you shouldn't have chosen a top-tier steakhouse for dinner
Go to Tads
Can't miss in this quaint Cafe-Grille
Wollensky's reputation, great service by waiter Tommy Richardson, and wonderful cuts of beef make this a fine pick before a show or during lunch
Casual dress, fair price
I'll be back!
We just had our wedding reception for 30 people at Maggie's on 4/15, and we and our guests can't say enough good things about Maggie's
Firstly, Victoria the manager was amazing, so professional and did not leave any of our important details to chance
The food at Maggie's is top notch!!! High quality, beautifully presented and excellent service
Whether you're looking for a place for dinner or a party, we HIGHLY recommend Maggie's Place!!!
Every time I come to this great little mid town gem, it just gets better
They`ve just added new flat screens and speaker systems so it`s awsome to watch the game
They`ve done huge renovations in the bar area creating so much more space for us to go after work for a pint
The barstaff are always friendly and aren`t shy with the buy backs
Always offering new/seasonal beers too
Lots of choice for someone who loves a great beer with fantastic service
I definately recommend this bar!!!
We tried Maggies for the first time last week
4 women-4 different tastes
Our lovely waitress (from Kildare) told us that they had just updated all their food and wine menus
We had a Seafood Cioppino, some little mini burgers from their munchie menu, a penne with grilled chicken arugula goat cheese and toasted pine nuts,and a scottish salmon dish
We had 2 beers and 2 of their new wines
WITH tip it was was only $100 bucks!!!! I can honestly say that Maggies will definately be visited again
There was a great crowd at the bar too
Tops are the crew here: Tory and Nick and the rest look after you
Great food, beer, music: atmosphere great at lunch and after work
Without a doubt the best Irish pub I've been to
Great music, stellar Guinness, good beer selection, and great food pale in comparison to the outstanding bar staff
Friendly and efficient, they always have time enough to chat
Watch out for Torah's bar tricks and NEVER put money on them
Usually plenty of space to move around, but rarely empty and always plenty of regulars to chat with; this place ranks amongst my favorite places in Manhattan
I hadn`t been to Maggies for a while since I relocated downtown
Most of the staff were new - but absolutely superb
The bartenders Tory and Nick were super-friendly, telling us stories of the Old Country and were very informed on their Irish single malt selection
This bar also hosts an impressive selection of beers
We had a tasty dinner on the outdoor balcony with great service from our hot waitress(in the hot uniform!!)
Definately check this place out !! you won`t be disappointed
Everything from the Guinness, to the food selection, and especially the service, is great about this little Emerald Isle gem in Midtown
This is the local bar we've all yearned for
MY FAVOURITE MIDTOWN WATERING HOLE
THE RIENDLY BARTENDERS ALWAYS MAKE YOU FEEL WELCOME AND PROVIDE EXCELLENT SERVICE
THIS PLACE IS GREAT FOR AN AFTER WORK COCKTAIL, AND THE FOOD IS AWESOME TOO
For what I thought was another Irish Pub I was pleasantly suprised when I went upstairs for dinner
Had the Buffalo Tuna and it was terrific! My waitress Sinead could not have taken care of us any better
Will be back soon
This is a great litle place! I hesitate telling anyone because I want it to be my great liitle secret
Awesome burgers and sandwiches for lunch and a fine dinner menu compliment this incredible gem in Manhattan
Love the bar! Get there early because they pack'em in quickly!
This glorified sandwich joint is a prime example of New York excess: Mangia is LUDICROUSLY overpriced
Having spent time in continental Europe, the food is certainly a reasonable approximation, but having to cough up $10 for a mediocre sandwich or $5 for a soup is beyond the pale - especially given the mean portion size and the crowds of bankers
To make matters worse, the restaurant is staffed by surly, mean-faced types with a limited grasp of English
Woeful
If you are expecting to be served like in a Real Italian Restaurant, You better think again
Perhaps, serving hummus instead of foccacia/olive oil/black olives will let you know that you are not in a authethic restaurant
(dissapointed) Over price for a lunch menu, including the lunch specials(be smart
ask, ask for the special price)
Service is fast according to lunch pressure time but, always a smile from the waiters is pleasant
from their helpers
don't bother waiting
We are regulars at Mangia -3-4 times, we usually get the delicious but overpriced telera ($
95 +tax) Today they said a customer complained the sandwich was too big so they are selling half a sandwich for $5
95 + tax, a whole sandwich is now almost $12 plus tax
They used to have the half Telera before, so this does not make sense
Today was the last day we went there
Too expensive and too crowded
We have an office account with Mangia and I ordered the Shrimp Ceasar Salad yesterday expecting the big grilled shrimp I have become accustomed to getting from Mangia
Well I got get this itty bitty little looked like frozen or can shrimp that was not grilled at all
Hugh disappointment! Are they going Down Hill? I'm thinking
Hey ever wonder when they get bigger they get worse, when they really should get better!
I eat here almost every night of the week
I really do love the food!!!!! The specials are always great, but beware, you'll be feeling them the next day---I always do
Take my advice: Eat here once, eat here twice, eat here every night of the week!!!
Great salads and pastas
The waiters are a little sarcastic and dry, but if you can get over their snootiness, the food is good
Excellent desert
A bit pricy for lunch
In Short This Manhattan mini-chain has been grilling them up and slapping them down for more than half a century
Remodeling has given the restaurants a more futuristic look, and television screens entertain the burger-munching crowds
Patties are served on toasted buns along with red relish, red onions and pickles
Fries are crisp, but there are plenty of non-burger options, including lobster salad, mixed salads and pie
Greasy food, grimy restaurant
Everything we had was saturated in grease and oil
The waitstaff were nice, though
Big portions, available seating for groups, yummy milkshakes and sandwiches
I've been there for lunch many times and the service is always cheerful and efficient
My co-worker and I went to Burger Heaven on a Tuesday on our lunch break
We arrived on the earlier side (around noon) and could not believe how fast we got in and out of this place--it was great! We were seated (by a lovely hostess), served (by a friendly waiter), and split all in a matter of about a half-hour
The food was quite good and the place was neat and clean
All in all, an impressive experience
My husband found this place and I wasn't too excited to try it but boy was I wrong
The service was excellent
The waitress when out of her way to help with our kids, like bringing cheerios for my 9 month old without us even asking
The food is always hot, fresh and to our liking
Best of all the prices are very reasonable
We've been staying in a hotel and Burger Heaven has delievered quite a few meals for us which is 100% better than the hotel food
If you are in the mood for a good meal at a fair price try this, you won't regret it:)
I believe this is authentic sushi

A BBQ sandwich with 2 sides for under $8? How can you go wrong?  If you go there, make a reservation
The place was packed, and there were a lot of people waiting for tables
And nobody rushes through a plate of barbeque
Yes this place had bad reviews resulting from the backlash from opening up
But these negative reviews are all true
The ribs were very dry and they are NOT the best ribs in NYC! What else can you expect from a mediocre chain? The parking is horrendous and don't even dare try to park in Fairway's lot! Security watches that lot like a hawk! They were on top of my car and ready to tow within minutes! This place is not worth the hassle of driving to
Delicious food, fast service, and affordable prices
Be sure to make reservations, especially if you are dining in a large group
The negative reviews for this place must have been the result of growing pains the restaurant went through after it opened
Food was BEST bbq I have ever had
We went Saturday night around 8pm and the wait for a table was 2hrs for 2 people so we ate at the bar instead
The bartenders were extremely receptive and eager to serve
The bar has a large selection of beers on tap,bottles or cans
We had the chicken wings as an app which were not your typical style buffalo wings,they were phenominal
For dinner we split a order of ribs with potatoes and maccheese
The ribs were unbelievalbe, they were cooked to perfection
I have never tasted a better batch of ribs anywhere
The maccheese was also fantastic which I highly recommend as side
I suspect word will travel quickly on this place,inevitably the bargain prices will be a thing of the past
I've been to this restaurant several times and have sampled a variety of items on the menu and have been overly impressed with everthing I've tried
If you are a fan of barbeque food, I highly recommend this restaurant, in my opinion, it's the best barbeque NY has to offer
Withr regards to the prior review which commented on the service: the restaurant is now accepting reservations for parties of all sizes
I would highly recommend making one as I too have had to endure some long waits before being seated
If you are not in a hurry however, there is a very pleasant bar area with a great variety of draft beers for you to enjoy while you wait for your table
All in all, this restaurant is a must try for any fan of slow-smoked authentic barbeque!
I have eaten at Dinosaur Barbeque several times and each time the service seems to get worse
The last time that I ate at there I waited over 90 minutes in line while people that arrived afterwards, without reservations, were seated ahead of me
I brought this to there attention and they apologized but then they continued to sit people ahead of us (friends of the hostess)
On a positive note the food is not bad


After reading some good stuff on this place I was expecting more
I felt that the meat had little flavor(ribs and chicken) and as result I had to use A ALOT of their bbq sauce (which is good) and the ribs were not falling of the bone
more like I had to tear the meat off myself
The sides were also lacking flavor
had the corn and beans
Pitcher of beers were fun and good selection
All in all I may be back to try their shrimp and pulled pork
but it will be a while
It is a good place if you and your buddies just wanna drink lots of beer and then have drunk food
We waited an hour to be seated and another hour for our food to arrive
Our meals unfortunately were really not worth the wait
Our main courses were downright not tasty and the pick your own side dishes sounded fun but were nothing special
Fun atmosphere and friendly service but we wouldn't plan on a return visit
Wow
I'd been hearing about Dinosaur for years from my friends from Rochester, and I have to say, it lived up to all my expectations- great beer selection, enthusiastic service, and oh my was the food good
Between the seven of us we sampled just about everything on the menu, and nothing disappointed (ribs pulled pork seemed like the biggest hits)
Since they had only been open a few days there were a few things that weren't on the menu yet, and it seemed like they were still having some problems figuring out the seating- other than that, everything excellent- definitely well worth the trip out there
We left stuffed and happy and already planning our next trip back
Seven of us went for dinner 4 days after DinoBBQ opened, three adults and 4 kids
We all love BBQ
Dino's was very good, certainly more or less authentic
They appear to use real meat smokers, and the ribs had the smoke tinged requisite color and taste
Sauce is good
Yet, I preferred the pulled pork, it is kicking
The sides were all good but, no mac cheese? Also, the wings were great, as were the fried green tomatoes and boiled Cajun shrimp
Prices for NYC are also good
They have about 2 dozen beers on tap
Although it was their 4th day they actually had their act together but, place was already mobbed
Great place
Finally the city with the greatest resaraunts in the world has a great bbq place
I've been to the one in syracuse a few times, and the only place I ever had bbq was in Texas, but that had more to do with atmosphere and price
So far I've only had leftovers from the Dinosaur in NYC, and even that was better than any bbq I've had in the city
The atmosphere is contrived - the Syracuse Rochester branches have more by the way of graffiti and kitsch factor
Here it's imported and incredibly PC
Where are the offensive bumper stickers? Attitude? Older biker waitresses in leather half tops? You could fit both the Syracuse and Rochester joints inside this one - the result is more 'Outback Steakhouse' than the legendary Dinosaur Bar-B-Que
Being kid-friendly is overrated
Thankfully the food is the same, for the most part, and it's de-licious
Some of the best stuff has been left off the menu: gravy, true mashed potatoes, chili as a 'homemade side', the Pappy-Slappin Catfish Strips, and the Dom Perignon (not that you'd order it, but the option was nice)
Regardless, definitely go
skip other meals that day in preparation
It's that good
Start with a lb
of the Drunken Shameless Spicy Shrimp and then move to the ribs
I've been to many bbq joints in this town and they are all dear to me in different ways, but Dinosaur brings it home
The staff cannot wait to help you, the ribs so beautifully fall off the bone, the Syracuse Salt potatoes are whole with buttery goodness on the inside and the baked beans have a spice in there that gets everyone talking, but is kept secret by the staff
You NEED to eat here
Best Ribs in NYC hands down
Do your taste buds a favor and go have a plate of Ribs, pulled pork, beef tenderloin and barbeque chicken like this guy did and then try to think of any other BBQ joint in NYC that comes close
You won't believe how good it is
Huge restaurant and great staff
I've eaten at their original Syracuse restaurant many times and was thrilled to hear about the NYC opening
The Dinosaur blows away all other BBQ in the city
Definitely worth the trip uptown
It looked really really good so a few weeks ago I asked the girls from work if we should try it for lunch
One told me that many months prior another employee went there and she ordered a pizza with sunny side up eggs on it
The server dropped it on the ground within her sight(!), picked it up off the ground and tried to serve it to her
Horrified, she demanded an apology and asked for the manager, at which point she discovered that he was the manager
So last week they decided that enough time had passed and that they would try the pizza again
They went and had a great lunch
They give you a little bowl of free olives and they have herb bushes that you can cut your own fresh herbs from to put on your pizza
Magical
They loved it
I decided to go today to pick up a mini pizza margarita
I brought it back to the office
Half way through I noticed something odd
They baked a friggin latex glove into my pizza
I immediately threw up
Latex is often worn to cover an open wound
I still feel dizzy from the experience

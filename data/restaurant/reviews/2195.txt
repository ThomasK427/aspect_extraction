I had a wonderful time, i ate, drank, danced
the service was outstanding, the crowd were very friendly and always smiling! the food took abit too long to get to the table but after it did, it was worth the wait
do i reccomend Giggles?, let me put it this way
i was back on friday nite! my hat off to this gem in midtown!
EVERYONE DOWN TO THE COOK IS DOWN TO EARTH AND VERY FRIENDLY
THE FOOD AND THE GREAT DRINKS ARE WELL WORTH THE BUC
BECAUSE OF THE DOWN TO EARTH FREINDLY STAFF AND PATRONS, STUFFY GROUPS ARE OFTEN INTIMIDATED AND CONSIDER THE CROWD LOW-CLASS
TRY TAVERN ON THE GREEN FOR YOUR GROUP
BTW EVERY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY THERE IS AN AFTERWORK PARTY! FYI  PARTY = MUSIC
Although there were about 25 empty tables, it took the waitress more than 20 minutes to seat us
After waiting a lonnnng time for her to come back for our drink order, and then food order as well, our meal finally arrived
Our burgers were overcooked, our fries were undercooked, and my other friends meal was served practically cold
I did not like the vibe of this place either, music way too loud, very unfriendly staff, rather all around cheesy place
I would not go back!
Went with a group of co-workers for a birthday celebration
Staff couldnt seat us, then they moved us, til finally our group of 20 left
Also, wouldnt allow sneakers
Something they certainly dont tell you until you are there
If you want to hang out in a cheesy restaurant and be treated like your money is worthless, this is the place to go! They must of forgot the golden rule of, the customer comes first
This bar is the worst in Manhattan
Very unattractive crowd, the hostess and manager are downright rude and nasty, the service is slow, the salsa music is so loud it is deafening, and the atmosphere stinks
I would not go back to this bar if you paid me
I am not sure I can describe in 150 words or less how HORRENDOUS this place is
The atmosphere is horrible - Latino music blarring so deafeningly loud (and it was only 6pm when I was there) that you cannot even speak to the person next to you
The crowd is unattractive and extremely low class, and so is the staff
The service is horrendous - the waitress who helped us was nasty, rude, and lacked interpersonal skills, and the manager is even worse
If you are looking for a laid back cool place to go for a drink after work in midtown, this is not the place
This place is extremely ghetto and does not belong in Midtown
It is absolutely horrendous
My friends and I left after 30 minutes - I would not go back if you paid me
This bar has the most low class crowd, the worst music, and the most unprofessional staff I have ever encountered
Stay away
It is a joke
Giggles is a great after work place, great location
I enjoyed the music, atmosphere and prices for drinks
Me and my friends have gone after work and had a great time
More of a Latin group, which was great
The guys were very polite with gentlemen manners
After 8pm it did get a little crowded, but it didn't really matter since we were having a blast
Bathroom was a bit small
And if you want a dinner table on a Friday night, you should get there early or reserve
Great place for lunch if you're in the Times Square area
Reasonable prices, good service and everything on the menu tastes good
Plus they have the best fries I've had in NYC
I've been there 2 Thursdays so far and it has been a blast
About 10 of us showed up after work and were promptly seated
The wait staff was friendly and helpful and after their shifts several waitresses partied along with the rest of us which should show you how cool this place is if the staff stays after work! Thursdays seems to be Latin night, but the DJ did mix it up a bit for the rest of us
Catch the GT crew on Thursdays for a great time(were the loud ones)
Inexpensive bar and restaurant with great food, strong drinks, nice music, and comfortable atmosphere
It's never been crowded after work and the staff is friendly
i go here on friday nights after work with a crowd
always have blast, the people and staff are all very nice
the drinks are worth the price ( nice and strong) and the dj from 6-10 plays a good variety of music from disco, hip-hop, house to latin
food is good, get there early though otherwise you might find yourself on line
when the night is over you it's early enough tko just go home or go somewhere else
I have been dining at Mr
Broadway for a very long time and they really have great food
The Sushi bar is always crampt busy and you can choose from fab chinese dishes or superb special Mediterranean grill meat and homemade cooking
Their Deli Sandwiches are huge and delicious and the portions are really jenerous
They deliver city wide and my office used them plenty for catering lunches and dinners which were also great
First and foremost, the service blows
After waiting 30 minutes for my take out order, they brought me a completely different order with the explanation that what I wanted wasn't available
So I ordered something else and that took another 30 minutes
And silly me I wanted forks to eat it with
That took another 5
On top of all this, every order was wrong
The food was disgusting
Just skip it
Slow-witted staff, glacial service, bungled orders and the food
atrocious
The worst mexican food I've ever had
The beans were runny, the rice was bland and only had peas and the enchiladas were unspeakable
I love this place
They make the guacamole right at your table and it is fabulous
Everyone is so welcoming
A truly authentic Mexican atmosphere in a very unexpected garment district location
This is probably the best Italian restaurant in the neighborhood
Nice ambiance
Very good service without being obtrusive
The food is prepared well, though the portions could be a bit more generous
The huge, spacious, cozy downstairs was a perfect place to have a large dinner with 100+ people, and the owner was wondeful and very accomodating! The staff was very attentive and polite, and the food was amazing - especially the tiramisu, absolutely delicious! Passes by the upstairs, and it's a great place to have a pleasant, romantic dinner, or just for some drinks and great Italian
All in all, this restaurant is fabulous!
Although the food and service is average, decor is nice and atmosphere is lively
Overall, it's a pretty decent restaurant (reportedly lots of well known ppl from the fashion industry like to go there)
The lunch scene is typically pack with business ppl, while the dinner time is much less crowed
Also, like many Italian restaurants, Arno offers good choices of dessert
The Scene The historical artifacts at this 120-year old restaurant impress as much as the excellent steaks and chops
Some 50,000 clay pipes, dangling from the ceiling, hearken back to the days when Babe Ruth, Albert Einstein, and Theodore Roosevelt puffed away
And though actress Lillie Langtry broke the gender barrier by suing for admittance in 1901, the clientele is still overwhelmingly male
The Food Meat is the name of the game here, especially if you are a fan of mutton: the legendary chop is rightly gamey and thick as a brick
Steaks are the most popular choice, however
The sirloin is beautifully marbled, a flavorful filet mignon arrives with firm, meaty scallops, and rich short ribs, stewed with carrots, leeks and potatoes, are especially wonderful in winter
A fresh lobster cocktail and tuna and salmon tartare are good light-meal choices
keens is old school great ambiance
the pipes collection and the fireplaces aren't your ordinary digs
the steak was fabulous and the prices were reasonable
better all around than wolfgangs or sparks
The best steak i have ever tasted was at keens
I got the filet mignon/lobster combo and it was DECADENT
the choclate mousse was also very very good

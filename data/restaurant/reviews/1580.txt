Of course we were promised by the manager at 8 that we would be seated within 15 minutes, and the same promise was repeated probably 5 times until we were finally seated
We ordered the toro tartare for appetizer and it reeked of fishy smell
2 further rolls were ordered and were subpar
Tempura was soggy and smelt of lukewarm/bad oil
Luckily, the shabu-shabu, which we had our main course was superb
Lesson: Service and raw food sucks, but shabu-shabu is one of the best in NYC
the food is great as usual
everything is super fresh and perfect
sometimes, the pleasant ambience is unsettled by the choice in music
if you could just tone it down just a tiny tiny bit
Catch them on a night they serve Kobe steak and you're in for a treat! It's not wallet busting either! Their Jalapeo sauce is worth the trip alone
If you go for shabu-shabu, the pork is the one to get
Start off with the tartare and ceviche as well
You can thank me later
I'm a Japanese who has been living in NYC for over ten years, and most of my pay-check goes to the restaurants
I love to eat
LAN is the best Shabu Shabu place in NYC, and not only that appetizers are as good as ones in good restaurants in Japan
If you want to taste authentic Japanese food, go to this place!
Lan has great shabu shabu
I don't recommend the steaks though
The teriyaki sauce(there's no such thing in Japan by the way) is too overwhelming so it kills the taste of beef
But I recommend their sushi and shabu shabu
You may be surprised, but their sushi is better than most of top notch sushi restaurants
I am meat loving carnivore and i think that the ribeye with the barbeque sauce was the best I had in NYC
I had raw sweet shrimp for the first time and is highly recommended
Good sushi (esp the salmon and yellowtail)
Very helpful and friendly staff
Lots of Japanese people, so it must be OK
Thank you for getting rid of that big TV screen
what a great way to start your night
Ladies, cash in on the $1 drink menu at Lan
These drinks are quite good and will get you buzzing after $3!! Not BAD in NYC
Food wasnt too good though
Stay at the bar and head out somewhere else
In Short The old world bar and enormous beer selection makes Silver Swan a popular spot with the after work crowd
German specialties, like oversized spatzle, kasseler rippchen (smoked pork chops) and apple strudel round out the menu
you'll love the beer selections, and the pretzels on the bar are fresh as always
Watch out for the hot mustard cause it packs a kick
Definitely knock you off your feet
Had 12 of us for dinner, tried almost all of the menu, every part good
The Silver Swan is a real standout in every way
Excellently prepared German fare at a very reasonable price
Citysearch says average 3 course meal at $20
This is not accurate however, $30-35 is closer to reality, but even at this it is well worth it
This has become my new German food spot it NYC
This is one of my favorite places in the city
I have never ordered anything from the Silver Swan that I have not thoroughly enjoyed! The bartenders and waiters alike are friendly, helpful and full of personality and the authentic German Cuisine can not be beat
Order from the bar menu and eat at the bar, and you'll enjoy some of the same great dishes from the restaurant menu at an even greater price! Try the goulash and any of the schnitzel dishes - you will NOT be disappointed!
to eat a good Schweinshaxe? No problem, the pork shank at the Swan will do just fine
Very tender and tasty just like in a cider bar in Frankfurt
Overall a great place to eat or just to hang at the bar
Never really too crowded which is a major plus !!
This is a good German place, if you know what to order
The potato pancakes are delicious, the salads are pretty fresh, and the Kasslerrippchen (tastes similar to ham) is a suggested dish
The draft beer is also enjoyable
It could use more atmosphere and lacks the authenticity of a true German restaurant
The Swan has a great selection of German and other imported beers
The stunning blonde Austrian barmaid/waitress recommended (without our asking) a perfect plate of assorted wursts and potato pancakes, served with apple sauce and sour cream for the cakes and hot and sweet Thomi mustard for the sausages
A perfect early snack with an Ayinger dunkel weisse
Go here for the beers and light eats, and you won't be disappointed
Very good wurst and sauerbraten
Large selection of bottled and draft beers
Service was very good too
Uncrowded on Saturday for lunch
A bit expensive I think, but this is NY
In Short Whether it's dinner, breakfast in the wee hours, or coffee and conversation at three in the afternoon, you can't go wrong with this always-open, always-crowded French bistro
The menu features specialties from France's culinary capital, Lyon, such as Quiche Lorraine, braised meats and soups
Hamburgers, steak frites and various salads are also available
I've been going to L'Express for years, until now a good old reliable meal
They just crash and burned big time
After waiting an hour and a half, a delivery man - with heavily bleeding gums - told me not to worry, that my meal had been replaced with fresh food, and that my old order had been RE-SERVED to another customer
Salmon, mind you
Proceed with caution
this is an old reliable place for me, i have been going there for years i love the old-world bistro groove and the bar is great for meeting people and their bartenders are really professional good cocktails
the food is decent for a late night nibble it beats any diner
I've been here twice in past 3 months and it is a decent place with decent food and nice ambiance
The lighting is perfect here
Today the bread here was especially good: sourdough loaf
but I was REALLY hungry when I got there
I had the burger with bluecheese
It was tasty and frites were good too
My wife's mushroom ravioli was so-so but she liked it
Tasted to me like raviolies swimming in Campbell's cream of mushroom soup
We shared a warm goat cheese salad which was good, but portion was small for $9
The waiter was nice and laidback unlike most NYC waiters
Overall, we had a very pleasant time
Least compliment I can give is you could do worse
Went on a Friday night
Food was bland : Duck Mousse, Salmon Dijonnais, Tilapia Fillet
Service was mediocre
Table layout was below-average
As crazy as this sounds, going late at night is a whole different experience
Recently, I went with a few girlfriends after a night out, and both the service food were excellent
The croque monsieur (which was complained about in another review) was fresh tasty, as were the other dishes served
In fact, the waiter was so nice attentive that he brought out a bday dessert for my friend -- for free! Fast forward 2 weeks later for a Sunday brunch it was a completely different story
I don't know what our waitress looked like b/c she never came around (not even for water refills or bread), the food tasted reheated (onion tart was bland the salad limp)
Happily tho, the fries were good
Service in this bistro/cafe was terrible
In a half-empty restaurant, the hostess tried to seat me next to the kitchen
My warm goat cheese salad arrived about 2 minutes after my appetizer-even though I'd specifically told the waiter that I wanted it second as my entree

Didn't have any wine, but there's almost NO markup on the wine list
The bang for your buck here is tough to beat
Server's were efficient, although not particularly charming
Decor was unique, quite cool and definitely worth seeing
Highly recommend Wild Ginger
The decor is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low prices
The lunch special is an asbolute steal
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience
The food was spicy and the drink specials were good-$5 Mojitos, but you could tell they were made quickly
Also, we were rushed to leave at 11pm and it was Cinco De Mayo
Then, we were given a flyer to have a free tequila shot on the way out and the bartender refused to serve us because they were closing, and literally ignored me and my boyfriend
We found the ambience unwelcoming overall
We tried it, and won't come back
As a big fan of tapas, I was eager to try Plantain after reading some good reviews
Fortunately, my high expectations were met! Though the restaurant has a discreet front, you are immediately greeted w/ a warm, tropical ambience
At the front of the restaurant, there is a decent-size bar w/ a sitting area large enough for a happy hour group
But the gem of this restaurant are the tapas and those who serve them
My girlfriends I really like all the selections choosen: seafood paella, shrimp cocas (spanish pizza), shrimp curry, plantain chips w/ various sauces
The sangria was the perfect way to top of our meal
I'll definitely go back for the salsa lessons the lunch box specials!
I was surprized to find this cute place after work with my girlfriends
I had no idea this place exisited! Once inside we were surprized to find a great bar and with our luck it was ladies 2 for 1 night! We also tried out the tapas and were blown away by the different fusion of flavors and spices
Although I would say it isn't traditional spanish/cuban tapas, which was my initial impression, but later found out it was Carribean influenced
Our cute and friendly bartender assisted us in choosing the popular tapas
The shrimp cocas pizza thing was amazing! I stuck to drinking the sangria all night, and my friends had the mojitos, margaritas and martinis and said they were excellent
I learned that they have salsa/mambo lessons in their lounge on Mondays which I'm earger to try
Can't wait to go back and actually have dinner
The food is OK, but the bartender accused me of not paying my tab! Even when a witness backed me up, she refused to admit she was wrong and had already taken my money
I have never been so humiliated! I will not return, too many other good places for tapas in NYC
Maybe because it was one hour before closing, the food came all at the same time ( appetizers and entrees all togheter
) Delicious, but I noticed the waitress was not happy that we ordered so many things
(maybe she had a date after work) Overall very succesful experiments with the food, but the service could be better
I originally went to Plantain to for a friend's b-day
everyone in the party loved the tapas and the drinks! I liked it so much that I decided to do my husband's surprise party upstairs (little lounge area, but not quite a lounge)
Service and management were fenominal, as was the food
I had about 40 guests upstairs and they kept the food/liquor coming, not to mention great latin music in the background
This is a small and cozy place- great for small parties downstairs or couples
I rented the upstairs for the party that I threw and did my own decorations
they did a great job
This place is a little diamond really worth trying out
I went to dinner there with my boyfriend and another couple, because I saw good reviews on nycitysearch
Honestly, I've had better tapas in other places
I didn't like the ambiance at all
The dance floor upstairs was small and had no ventilation
The only thing that was good was the service
I definitely will not come back again
Plantain Restaurant has a lot of class
The people in there, from the Manager to the waiters and waitresses, are very friendly and professional
They try to accommodate your every needs
This is a great place to meet new people
Especially on Monday Nights where they have Salsa Lessons and Spanish music
I was there New Years Eve for the party
I am not one to take time to review anything but this place is off the hook! WE paid $120
00 a person and drank top shelf booze all night long
The food kept coming all night long as well
It was like good sex that never ended
The owner,chef,and staff personally made it a point to come out into the crowd and make a personal appearance that was cool
I give this place a 10++++ for Service, style, atmosphere and food
Booze is the same everywhere although I do recommend the Sangria or Moheto drink
I will be back!
Plantain is a ray of light in drab midtown
The menu is extensive with a Latin American flair, the drinks are ample and bursting with flavor and the staff is first rate
Prices range from $5-$19 for Tapas dishes and $6-$25 for drinks and specialty liqueurs
By 10:00 the place is packed, so I'd definitely recommend making a reservation if you're a late diner
If you want to escape New York's January cold, run to Plantain for some tropical care
after watching citysearch's-review-i-decided-to take my girfriend for dinner at this cozy little place, being a tapas fan myself, i wanted to see if the menu lived to the expectations, boy!! do they have a small but awesome selection of tapas and drinks, i couldn't help but notice, a slight caribbean influence in the spanish theme
which gave a warm feeling to our dinning experience, we tryied the spanish cocas, a simple yet tasty appetizer, the ceviche was carefully prepared and had a great citrus-spice balance, the chorizo and patatas bravas-angry potatoes were a little spicy to my taste, but after trying their signature drink-plantain's punch- i couldn't help but to keep on trying some of their best offerings, our waiter carlos was very polite and quite eager to explaiin their menu to the last detail, great music selections in the upstairs lounge very romantic! we'll definitely be back
one of the best mojitos i ever tried,service amazing such of great staff in this place,and the food something else,i was specting different type of tapas but we got more than happy my mom love the shrimp ceviche,really original,but in my opinion the jerk chicken stole the show,great mofongo and muy rico tres leches,very happy for a place like this in my neighborhood,i never seen such of original drinks,i think we tried them all,and he sangria is just perfect,thanks for a great time and great food
Stopped last Thursday evening while in from Connecticutt
The place was alive with Brazilian band
Had drinks at the bar 1st
Though making drinks nonstop, our bartender ( later found out name was John) took the time to greet us make suggestions - my margarita was one of the best and my companion loved her mojito
John went the extra mile to seat us when the maitre d' was busy and offered dancing suggestions for later
Such service! Our waiter had lots of experience also, offering us attentive service, detailed menu suggestions and little extras like new napkins when ours fell
( Waiter's name - Tracy) And the Food? Superb! Creamy lobster bisque, tangy ceviche, interesting eschebeche and mouthwatering paella ( the evening special)
We finished with tres leche and a perfect cappucino
Definitely a place to visit again! Next time we want to try the chef's tasting menu
I liked this place even though it is not as chic as I thought would be from the impression I got at it's web site
The place is small, relatively well decorated, some interesting paintings on the wall
Second floor lounge was not open when we went
Latin music was played at perfect volume
Mojito was great with real sugar cane in it
Jerk Chicken with Mogongo on the side was fantastic
The service was great
Price was reasonable for NYC
This place could be a great party place if it has a large crowd with upstair lounge open for dancing
But for now, I would just go for the food only
I had my birthday party here on a Wednesday night
The restaurant wasn't overly crowded, and our group took up the back table for most of the night
The staff was very attentive and patient with such a large group
People kept coming and leaving, some even spilled onto other tables - it's a good thing it was fairly sparse
The staff was very very kind, and the manager continually checked to make sure we were enjoying ourselves
The bill was a little high for a group of recent college grads
The drinks ran from 6-10 dollars, and good, but not exceptional tapas from 7-12? However, overall- I was VERY pleased
I highly recommend Plantain to anyone looking for a good time, in a laid back, Latin artsy, customer friendly environment
(And be sure to try the Plantain Punch - so good! The perfect summer drink
)
This place definitely deserves much credit for their fantastic service
The manager is awesome and extremely attentive
The food is quite good and it's a mix of multiple countries/cultures

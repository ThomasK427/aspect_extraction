THIS IS THE BEST STEAK THAT I HAVE EVER HAD
We eat out often and have been to all the best steakhouses in Manhattan
Price was reasonable for 2 people for a great meal in NY
And the cream spinach was great also
We had the french fries which were also good
But I would skip dessert
from the no nonsense menu (steak only) to the bare bones furniture, this place is great
some complain about the service (what service?) but the steak is great, (just don't make the mistake of ordering well done!) and I have never had better
Peter Luger Steak House is without a doubt the best -- ANYWHERE! There are a few contenders (I have tried many other steak houses both in New York City and across the country) but I always come to the same conclusion -- if you want the best steak -- go to Luger's!
There are at least 15 better steakhouses in NYC than this restaurant that somehow manages to be simplistically pretentious
Appetizers were OK, steak was not as good as what I would have prepared at home on the grill
If you want a better steak -- and the ability to choose your favorite cut of meat (porterhouse only at Luger's) try Smith and Wollensky's on 3rd Avenue
If you want a nice steakhouse atmosphere with comfortable surroundings and a steak superior to Luger's, try Keens Steakhouse in the mid-30s
I don't know how anyone could claim to have eaten a better steak in New York
I've eaten at all of the usuals (Ruth Criss, Sparks, Mortons etc) and none of them come close to Lugers
People who complain about the service are nitpicking
I go here 3-4 times a year and am treated wonderfully everytime
There is no reason for a menu as there is no reason to order anything but the porterhouse, creamed spinach and hash browns
Also, the bacon appetiser is delicious
Everything here is superb: service, food, wine list, appetizers, and side dishes
Try the creamed spinach -- it's out of this world!
Peter Lugers, even the name makes me drool
The porterhouse steak on a sizzling plate drenched in butter makes other restaurants wonder isn't all steaks cooked this way
Cream of spinach is absolutely delicious and the waiters are true professionals
I've tried steaks in Chicago (Mortons, Gibsons, Ruth Chris, etc) and Peter Lugers tops them all
Make a reservation now since its a constant hot spot
Our family just had a great time at Peter Luger's
The food was excellent
Our waiter, Bernard, was pleasant and helpful
No looking down his nose when we asked for menus
The steak was great and the pecan pie with schlag was heavenly
Luger's may not be the fanciest of places and the waiters are true New Yorkers through and through but a better steak can not be found period
You will not be disappointed
Don't forget the unlimited sides of creamed spinach and the potatoes
Oh and bring your cash
No plastic here
Unless you have their own Peter Luger card
Applications are available on their website
Make your reservation months in advance too
I consider myself a true seak connoisseur having sought out and eaten in the best steak houses all over the USA
There is no question that the sheer quality of the steak in Peter Luger is so far above any other that there is no contest
If you are a real steak lover and want the absolute very best steak prepared in the very best way, there is simply no other choice
Peter Lugers has 2 locations here in NY, and to be honest with you, they are the 2 best steak houses in the tri-state area
The best aged steaks, not to mention the greatest steak sauce available
Should you go, get the steak for 2, cream of spinach and hash browns
You will not be dissappointed
Peter Luger's is truly overrated
The Staff is arogant and selr-impressed
The food is good but not fantastic
The place is crowded and noisy, which would be tolerable if the service wasn't so snarlly
Peter Luger Steak House may have good food, but certainly far from being number one in NYC
I think Lugers is entirely over rated
The steaks are just not that good
The Midtown steak houses including Sparks and Ruth Chris' far out taste Lugers
Although the sides at Lugers are delicious (the bacon is out of this world) the steak is entirely priced way too high
I would not recommend wasting your money here
With the ever increasing number of top notch steak houses in the NYC area, why settle for a typical 1
5h wait after making reservations at least 1 month in advance
Not to mention poor service, poor ambience , mediocre drinks cramped bar space while you wait
If your dropping that kind of cash drop it elsewhere
Everyone knows that this plays carries tremendous hype
This place almost lives up to it
The appetizers and side dishes are run of the mill
But the steak did not dissapoint! The porterhouse gets better and better with every bite
Plus the house steak sauce is awesome
If you are a premium steak eater
this place is a must
Also, who says that this place has bad service
My party were treated with world class table service
Plus they arrange car service to take you back home
The porterhouse is as good a steak you are going to find in NYC or the surrounding area
It may even be one of the tops in the nation
The steak was good from the get go and stayed good to the last bite
Service has a reputation for being gruff, but Steve was helpful, funny and generous
The lighting is what it is, and if you expect a nice frilly steakhouse, you've come to the wrong place
Luger's is what it is, and what it is is a great steakhouse
Get the bacon, the porterhouse, the hashbrowns and spinach
Then go home happy
TIP- keep the liquor consumption down and you can have dinner for a steal of a deal
i was not a big steak fan until i tried the porterhouse at PL
now i am a convert and am eagerly anticipating my next reservation there in a month
simply put the porterhouse is to die for
its got the texture of butter, comes already sliced, and practically melts in your mouth
i relished every bite and could have eaten more than my half of a porterhouse for 2
creamed spinach, german potatoes and tomato/onion slices are also excellent
fast before coming here and skip the onion rolls to enjoy the steak to the maximum
its da bomb!!
we suggest for first time peter luger visitors
in the evening when it's dark
to have dessert and coffee at the River Cafe
a short driving distance away
the view at night from brooklyn of lower manhattan and it's buildings and bridges is truly incredible unforgetable
The food is great
Mouth watering steaks
WOW!!!! $150 for diner for two!!!!!!! Just try it once in your life
For those of us who like some flavor on our meat, this is not the place for us
The steak is a high quality steak and is quite large, however there is no flavor in it except meat
One thing I will say is that you will not have indegestion, even after eating more than 2 lbs of steak
Peter Luger is the finest steakhouse in the world
Ordering a burger at that fine establishment is among the most inane actions that can be taken in this city

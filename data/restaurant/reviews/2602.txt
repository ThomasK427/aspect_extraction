The food wasn't good, atleast not for the price
We had filet mignon, and asked for it well done, it was so well done, that the entire outer layer of the steak looked like burnt charcol
The view was great though, and the change of view due to the returant revolving was awesome
I recomend this resturant only for a special occasion, and to go to just once
The food is marginal - not bad per se, but not what you'd expect at the price
The only thing worth recommending is the view: from the 47th floor of the Mariott Marquis hotel in the middle of Times Square, and the only restaurant in Manhattan that revolves
It's great to go once, see the sights, then that's it
We went on a Tuesday night, around 8:30 and the restaurant was basically empty so service was pretty good
We did notice they had a buffet in the lounge, perhaps that would be a better deal
I'd still recommend it, but with warnings
never go to a restaurant that is known more for its location than its food
its called the view because it overlooks times square
that's about the only good thing about the restaurant
the decor is cheap and tacky w/ its gaudy carpeting, fake mirror facets
the service was decent
the food itself wasn't bad
but w/ its price tag, it should have been better
very tourist
don't bother coming here
real new yorkers would never set food there
ny is known for its awesome restaurant and scene
this place isn't one of them
Let me sum up the menu for you
VIVA LA TOURISTA!  Lobster bisque? No lobster - only crabmeat
Steak medium rare? Oh So Sorry! Well done
The view? Unless your idea is peeping into the windows of office buildings, try someplace else
Wait - there is something nice I can say, the wine list is actually very good, and quite affordable
Other than that, Marriot can sit on this and rotate
The food here is bland and tasteless
We ordered duck, steak, and salmon, and even though these foods are pretty rich without much seasoning or sauce, this restaraunt still managed to serve them without any taste
In addition to that, this pompous, tattoed waiter with dark hair spilled 2 glasses of wine on two of my friends and didn't even apologize
Because there were 6 of us, we still had to give him 20% tip
There arent many decent restaurants near columbia, but at least the other places don't pretend to be fine dining places
Went there for lunch
This place must be more of a dinner joint, because it was quite empty
Our server (Dave) was able to man the bar and restaurant and provided great service in a very friendly way
The food was very tasty (I had the porkchops) and the room was nice as well
Big thumbs up, although if you like a more crowded atmosphere, you may want to go there for dinner rather than lunch
We went to Sam's after seeing the Lion King
Our experience was very favorable
There were 6 of us, we were seated right away and the service was very good
I had the pork chop special and enjoyed it, two others had the lobster ravioli special and that was also very good
Another had the calamari over linguini and that was just OK
Overall, I would recommend this restaurant
It added to a very enjoyable day in the City
We were running late for the theater and went in because it was close
It was packed, but we had a table in a minute and the service was great
The food was good, the piano player was good, the theater was good
Life is good
We had a great experience at Sam's! We were running late for the theater and I for one was all stressed out
We arrived at Sam's and were immediately seated
We needed to call the theater and our server (Elizabeth) not only got the number for us but lent us her cell phone to make the call
Once that was settled, we were able to enjoy a great meal, a few glasses of wine and the piano in the background before making off for the show
Great food, excellent Jazz and good location, and a very good bar
Went to Sofia's after an evening show due to the proximity to the theatre (across the street)
The service was slow and quite rude
I considered leaving no tip it was so bad
I was a server during college so I usually tip well but this was very poor service
Food was bland and small portions for the price
I wouldn't go back
Really, there are so many better restaurants in the city don't waste your time
The only (and I mean ONLY) positive was the atmosphere
There was some band playing soft instrumental music
My husband, daughter and I visited Sofia's on December 3 before going to see Movin Out
The staff was rude and service was terrible
We were told they had no coffee because there was no bus boy
I would not return to this restaurant
The play, by the way, was excellent
My husband and I visited Sofia's before a Wednesday theater matinee
We were seated promptly and our orders were taken quickly
The service was slow, but the food was excellent
Our main complaint was the service - our waiter was surly and slow
But the other servers seemed to be great
We have never been disappointed
You get good value and an above average dinner
It is perfect for a before theater dinner
Took a chance on this restaurant based on the reviews listed on this website, which are completely split down the middle
Bad idea
The interior had no ambiance whatsoever
I was the only Italian in the place and the Indian waiters were no go-getters
We went for Sat
lunch and ordered off of the special menu (soup/salad-entree-coffee)
Dessert was not part of that menu, a real disappointment, until you looked at the dessert cart
The cakes and pies looked like they had been there awhile
The chicken in the dishes we ordered were all dark meat
Overall, a bad decision on our part
Our group of seven had made a reservation, and we were seated promptly
Unfortunately, that was only thing prompt about the service
The place was only about half full, but we were basically ignored
We had to flag down the waiter even to refill water glasses! My husband's steak was prepared incorrectly, and the rest of us were almost done eating by the time they got his meal back out
Our waiter never once checked back with us, except to bring the check
The food was okay, but not worth the hassle
We will not go back
My husband and I dined here once
It was bitterly cold outside and Sofia's looked inviting and warm
We were seated promptly
However, our table was directly in front of the door which they had propped open so that the maitre'd could rope in customers
The icy cold air just poured in from outside and they didn't seem to notice
I ordered pasta with pesto sauce
What I was served bore no resemblance to pest

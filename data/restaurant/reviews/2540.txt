No appetizer for my girlfriend, and yet more eye rolls and a gnome-like snort
Our appetizers took an hour to arrive, and I got some excuse as to how the mussels take a long time to cook
They were also growing my salad
Third, the food was average
The wild boar pasta special tasted like beef stew
Not bad, but not great
Overall, a huge disappointment
I don't think I have received worse service anywhere else
First, it took around 45 minutes for our appetizers to arrive, and this was after we asked them to check with the kitchen why our appetizers (a salad and mussels) were taking so long
Then, the entrees arrived before the appetizers
The waiter was unexcusably rude and blatantly treated customers who were willing to spend more better
We saw his eyes literally lighting up with joy when the table next to us ordered an expensive wine
Guess what? Their salad arrived in 5 minutes
Food is good, but not exceptional enough to redeem service
I thought the food was very good but romantic I wouldnt say that the tables are basically on top of each other I could barley move
The food is very good though and so was the service
HAD DINNER THERE RECENTLY WITH SOME FRIENDS, THE MENU HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT, BUT THE FOOD IS JUST AS GREAT AS EVER
LOTS OF NEW ITEMS TO TRY AND ENJOY
LOVED THE SKIRT STEAK WITH THE BROCCOLI RABE AND THE PORK CHOP SPECIAL
WE WILL BE BACK, THIS RESTAURANT IS A GREAT FIND
Great homemade italian food just like at Grandma's on Sundays
Try to be seated in the cute little back room for those romantic nights
The papardelle with duck ragout is amazing
The service isn't overly friendly but they get the job done
Although the food was quite tasty, I cannot understand why anyone would pay so much for the uninspiring food with so little atmosphere
Unless you are deemed worthy enough to dine in the tiny wine celler room, you are left to sit in the main front dining room, which is not very romantic and pretty plain (minus the red paint on the walls)
The lighting was bad and there was not any music playing
It just did not do it for me, no matter how good the wine and food is
I was there with a group of ten people and we had the most incredible meal
We spent the entire evening swapping bites of our food and talking about how great everything was
It was without question an awesome dining experience in a charming neighborhood restaurant
I went to this restaurant a while ago with some friends
The food was good, not extraordinary, but good none the less
The waiter we had wasn't the best, in fact, he was kind of rude when we weren't sure what type of wine we wanted to order with our meal
The restaurant is also a bit small
From the looks of things, the better tables were being given to those who were looking to spend more money
We always stop for lunch here
Best pastrami in NYC
Who do these people think they are? Carnegie? Stage? Gimme a break! At half-price they should knock a dollar off
After dining at Divino's a couple of times I decided to have my daughter's baptism there
and they did such an amazing job
The food was fantastic, the wait staff was very efficient
The owner really took care of us in every aspect
I would highly advise upon this restaurant
This place is great for a first date
and on the weekend's they have entertainment
Good food and attentive service
A nice place to dine at your own pace
Not suitable for large parties but for a couple or a foursome it is ideal
Their risotto is world class
If you can, try to get Sal as your waiter
If a man on a keyboard is your idea of great live music, then this is the place for you
We were told by many people how wonderful this restaurant is, so we brought a group of 10 for dinner one Friday night
Disappointed isn't the word
They served our dinner family style (upon request)
which consisted of ONE small scoop of pasta and way too much fish and chicken
When we asked for more pasta, they replied, sorry, we're out
What?? We were also quoted one set price and when the bill arrived it was almost double that! The food was very tasty, but everything else was just awful
Perhaps it's better in the fall/winter when the Hampton crowds are back in the city? I don't plan on finding out
This small family restaurant lacks a little arm space when you cram 4 people into their tiny booths but it is well worth it for the food
Great portions of pasta and a really low price for a New York Restaurant! The service was friendly and we didnt have to wait long for our food
The wine was great too! At $2 a glass how can you go wrong with great Italian wine? I would definitly suggest this restaurant if you want to strech your pennies while visiting NY
In Short With its warm, cluttered French provincial ambience and courteous staff, Le Refuge manages to make the most casual visitor feel like a neighborhood regular
The dining room plays on woody bistro motifs; in warm weather, guests gather at one of a dozen tables in a lovely garden
The menu of updated French country classics includes shrimp couscous, roast duck with fresh strawberry sauce and a saddle of veal with morel mushrooms
Desserts include ice cream-filled profiteroles and excellent cheesecake tinged with raspberries
This Restaurant was very  Ask to the waiter or waitress to give you a table in the back room where all the romance of the place is situated with a so-called chimney!! And don't be fooled by the entrance!!! As a french woman just started to live in USA, NJ, i was particularly impressed by the quality of the food served in that restaurant
Tasty and absolutely delicious
I particularly recommand the feuillete d'escargot, the roasted duck with brocoli mousse and strawberry sauce, and for desert some profiterolles (with HOT CHOCOLATE)!!!' As beverages ask for a KIR Royal (it's not on the menu), but they would serve it if you ask
We were seated in the front room which was nothing special
I ordered the goat cheeese gratin for an appetizer, which came drenched in oil
We had the yellow fin tuna for dinner, which was alright
We expected to have a wonderful, romantic dinner, but ended up leaving the restaurant fumming
We had been given a gift card for $250
00
We tried to pay the bill with it, they would not accept it
Apparently the restaurant, was now under new ownership, however still using and banking on the past Le Refuge reputation
We asked for the manager, he said he couldn't honor it because he was afraid he would get into trouble
He was helpless, and appeared to not be any position to assist or too scared too
We left upset, confused and very irritated
Due to the service (or lack of) I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
Delicious French food, fish dishes particularly good as well as the steak
Very nice French wines
Service is very attentive, professional and hardworking (maybe even overworked)
Very cozy ambience, nice date place or for special occasion
I agree with the raters who suggested trying to get a table in the back - the front area does have a bar and it's somewhat of a high-traffic area
I recommend making a reservation
It's a great place to have some french food - the waitstaff is really friendly and helpful, and the food is stellar
It can get to be expensive, though, so save it for a special occasion  Also, the tables in the front are way too close together; when you make your reservation, try to get a table in the back
Nice atmosphere, great prices for New York
The food was better than I thought it would be from the simplicity of the menu
But beyond all that, it was the people who were the exceptional experience
Being a non-New Yorker, it can sometimes be daunting, especially in a French restuarant for a single diner
The service was warm, friendly and the food was better because of it
When it gets cold in Manhattan, my thoughts turn to Le Refuge on the upper east side
The food is always the best: meat, seafood or even pasta, the drinks are generous, the wine list has many reasonable choices, and the atmosphere is romantic bistro
You'll always get a yahoo who's never been there before who wants and can't get a special table, but make a reservation, get there on time, and you're in for a treat
There's a reason they're popular
And check out their pre-theater and early-bird specials!
I have eaten here many times, and have always had a wonderful meal

Harriet's Kitchen is mainly a take-out/pick up place
They have great roasted chicken and yummy sides
They're always super quick with the delivery and the prices are pretty good
this is the perfect place to go with friends or with your significant other
the smores are delicious and the coffee mugs are huge, allowing for the perfect sized portion
highly recommended for an after-theater snack
food is good too
Al Dente is one of our most favorite restaurant in the upper westside neighborhood
It's intimate atmosphere is perfect for a quiet dinner or a dinner for 6
We love the pasta Al Dente and their penne vodka
It's good value for the buck and we will definitely be returning!
Discovered Al Dente on our last trip to New york
We sat outside with friends on a plesant summer evening
The waiter was VERY attentive and helpful
The food was amazing! Will definitely return
RANCHO CAFE BEST PLACE FOR FRESH HOME MADE MEXICAN FOOD AND BEST MARGARITAS IN THE CITY
TRY WEEKSDAYS, HEAVY CROWD ON WEEKENDS
It's true, their mango margaritas are unique
The weak alcohol is NOT, however, worth dealing with a disrespectful staff
If you're in the mood for slow service, being ignored, and waiting for the bartenders to stop gabbing and actually notice you, then drop in
Outright customer disrespect truly makes for a bad evening
Take your business elsewhere! Check out Ariba Ariba on 9th Ave
I was visting a friend of mine from college to celebrate her 25th bday and we decided on mexican food
After being turned away from Mama Mexicos because they were crowded and the wait was ridiculously long we decided to check out Ranchos which was right around the corner from her apt
(We passed by it earlier that day) The wait was not long at all
We didn't even have time to finish our drinks at the bar before we were seated by the nice hostess
I've never had mexican before so it really was a treat, the restaurant is a nice size, i didn't feel like i could hear everyone's conversation
And yes the sangrias are worth the trip! Good place to take a first date, girls nite out, etc
I'm sure we'll go there again when we return to ny
Constantly great meal along with the drinks friendly staff
Love their music, so uplifting loud enough to forget about problems
Thanks for giving so much fun!
Here's a gem in Upper Manhattan
Decent food, good music, and attentive service
It's not the best Mexican food I've had, but it's far from the worst
No complaints except for a limited menu and very cimly lit
romantic??? The Sangria alone is worth making the trip!
My boyfriend introduced me to his favorite Sunday restaurant, Ranchos when I was last in NYC
IT was pouring down rain when we entered the cozy and warm decor of Ranchos
Then the music, the food, the Margys
all a 10
I could not get enough Margaritas, so he has promised not to go back to Ranchos until I return to NYC
(I don't think he can really wait
but I hope so) You can't go wrong at Ranchos!
Good margaritas and tasty food
Not many vegetarian options
There's a small area where you can sit outside which makes it worth the trip in the warmer weather
Better than Mary Ann's but not nearly as good as Mama Mexico
The Scene The room is vast, with high ceilings, rich cream-colored walls and photographs on the walls that lend a pleasant feeling of history
The service is vigorously efficient, friendly and accommodating, as suits a busy, festive restaurant like this one
The Food This is well-known southern Italian fare: pastas, chicken, beef, veal and so forth, and all dishes are served family-style in massive portions suitable for several people; even sides are entree-sized
But the food is surprisingly well crafted for such a large and casual restaurant: Baked clams are juicy and garlicky, stuffed artichokes delicate and well-seasoned, even the bread is fresh and delicious
The restaurant's one vice is a heavy hand with salt
If that doesn't bother you, try the savory rigatoni with sausage and broccoli, the tasty, ultra-cheesy manicotti and nightly specials like decent, if dryish, osso buco surrounded by a horde of gnocchi
This place is fantastic
The food is great, the service is better
Huge plates of food, endless bread, and the feeling of being in an old world restaurant/kitchen
This place is huge but, you do not get that feeling when you are there
Each dish we order was great, we were a group of 21 and the service was better than I could have expected
From appetizer to deseert and coffee, we had a great experience and cannot wait to go back
The service is exceptional and the food is quickly climbing the ranks as one of my favorites in NYC
Traditional Italian food, family style servings are huge and overall prices are very affordable- Carmine's is truly a gem
Definitely geared towards large groups (make a reservation) however if coming with a group under 4 or 5 the wait is not that long
this is no place to go for fewer than 4 ppl
i've been here numerous times and the food is consistently good
the value is wonderful if you end up sharing a few dishes with ppl
i LOVE their foccacia bread
it's what keeps me going back
try their chicken parm
i'd go back any day
it's really noisy though, bc the place is really spacious
i have never left unfilled
When you go to a place like Carmines, you must expect that food is not going to be spectacular authentic Italian fare
The place is great because of the atmosphere, which encourages obnoxious food consumption and heavy drinking (for the people there without children)
I have been to Carmines at least 20 times and I must admit that the food is good but nothing special but I have had so much fun every time I have gone there, that it is beyond worth it
The place is popular for sure and not just for tourists, but I doubt it is for the quality of their food
I love coming to Carmines! The food is good and the atmosphere is festive
The restaurant is extremely noisy, so don't look for romance--though there's a birthday being celebrated every 5 minutes
Note: make reservations or suffer the consequences
We had dinner reservations for 13 to celebrate my sister's graduation
A busboy grabbed two of our serving plates before we were finished with them
We tried to get his attention, but he apparently didn't hear us
When confronted, the busboy was dismissive
The manager's attitude was also unprofessional
Eventually, we found our waiter
He said, I can't control them
It's not my fault
How much food was actually left?, but that sounded like, Come on! How much food was actually left? My sisters have worked in restaurants
They understand the pressure, but they found the demeaning attitudes disgraceful
The manager eventually lowered the $280 bill by $40
My father told him and the waiter, You were rude and very unprofessional
We planned to order more plus dessert, but now we're leaving
People probably accept it when they rush you out the door
It's clear they don't need our business
Carmine's is great
We go to the uptown one more because we seem to get seated faster there
The food is always fabulous
If you don't like rich, garlicky food, this isn't your place
But, if you love a good variety of great Italian food, this is it! Everything I've tried has been excellent
And the service is always very friendy

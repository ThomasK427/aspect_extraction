Beer is warm with water
Not recomend at all
Pizza so good my wife and I came close to weeping
A little bit of a wait, but it was well worth it
The crust was so good that the pizza needed no toppings, but we got the #20 and it was awesome
Just remember that no slices policy!
On a recent trip to New York, I tried Grimaldi's, Lombardi's and John's
My favorite? John's
Patsy's in Harlem is pretty good too
Any trip to NYC must include a taste of real New York pie and you really can't go wrong with any of these
That was the best pizza i have ever ate
The service was great and the food was awesome
I love this place
I was just up there last month
it was soo good
the line looked long but we only waited for about 10 minutes
the staff were very friendly and the pizza was delicious
beer by the pitcher was awesome too! its nice to visit such established joints
Went to John's while visiting NYC
Actually saw the pizzia joint on a Pizza documentary on the Food Network
The show said it was one of the best that NYC had to offer and they were right
Great atmosphere, great service, great pizza
Can't wait to get back there for another pie!!!!!!
The saddest moment in my life was moving out of the city and not being able to have John's at least three times a week
Has to be the most amazing pizza ever made
Anyone who would consider putting grimaldis or lombardies in the same category does not know what a great pizza is
Went last night due to City Search Rating
People who rate ii so high must not originally be from NYC
I am an Italian from Bensonhurst, Bklyn and know a good pizza and John's does not cut it! Ordered a Sausage/Meatball/Mushrooms, result was dry sauceless pizza with plastic type mozzerella
Unable to distinguish between sausage slices and meatball slices which were both void of any flavor
Best Pizza anywhere, Lombardi's
Sweet sauce lased with fresh basil, Fresh Mozerella, Home made whole meatballs and sausage chunks- BEST ANYWHERE!  When in Brookly try LB, Spumoni Gardens
This NYC native moved out of the neighborhood years ago and hadn't been to John's in a long time
I recently found my self dwon town and couldn't resist it! I'm so glad I went in
John's still has the best pizza in all of NYC
The best chared crisp crust, tangy sauce and some of the best sausage I have ever tasted
This place reminds me of Naples
Go and order a small pie with sausage and mushrooms, when hungry you could probably finiish the whole pie!!! John's Rocks!!!!
This place probably has some of the worst pizza and service in the city
I just don't understand the hype
the last time I was there it seemed to draw a lot of tourists and a large bridge and tunnel crowd
Maybe that's how they stay in business
A lot of one-timmers from out of town
Lombardi's is better
Even Arturos
The best seems to be Nick's in Forest Hills
It's worth the trek
I hadn't been to John's in a long time, and was happy to find it is still as good as ever
I have tried all the others in recent years, but John's still has them beat
Plain and simple pizza that tastes great
I recently stopped in and tried the much-hyped pizza
I was NOT disappointed
It was some good pizza
I must say the service was slow but it was crowded
If your in the City try it
I've been to many pizza places and I can honestly say I've never had better pizza than John's
It's my all time favorite
I go there every chance I get
Unlike others here, I didn't have to wait
After a trip to the Blind Tiger (a great beer bar on Hudson) what better than some good pizza? Been wanting to try John's for a while now
The pizza was very good
hot and delicious
The sauce was tangy and excellent in every way
There was a bit too much cheese for my taste
I do believe that the coal oven adds a very unique taste which I love
I had high hopes, but honestly Totonno's (the original Coney Island location) still takes the crown
I am going to try Lombardi's next
Whatever you do, you really can't go wrong with coal oven pizza in New York City! John's is a nice place if you are in the neighborhood
but if you are a pizza connoisseur, check out the original Totonno's on Neptune Ave in Coney Island!
We dined at John's on a trip in the spring to NYC
Wow! Our dining experience was great
The wait was pretty long, but it was well worth it
The pizza was THE BEST!
The pizza here is decent, but nothing special
It beats Lombardi's, which some people seem to think is good just because of the fresh mozzarella, but Grimaldi's is better
The atmosphere is pretty good though and the service is friendly
I ate here for lunch today and was not impressed by the place or the food
The pizza was OK and the service was non-existent (after you place your order, that is)
I would've been really pissed if we had had to wait for a table
The bottom of the pizza crust was soft; not something you'd expect from a place prides itself on brick oven pizza
This place is a distant third to Lombardi's and Arturo's
Try those places first
The pizza here is fine, especially if you have a thing for brick-oven pizzas
That said, it's difficult to get a table, you can't order individual slices, and it hardly distinguishes itself from any other brick-oven pizza restaurant
The service is inattentive at best
Being from the south, NY pizza is a whole different ballgame
This establishment had the tastiest pizza I've ever put in my mouth and it seemed to have very fresh ingredients as well
Would recommend to any local or visitor!
The pizza here is incredibly inconsistent
The only time I had a decent pie is when it came topped with anchovies
Otherwise, often the crust is soggy - a big no no for real pizza lovers, and the taste bland
The last time I came i didn't even finish my pie - and then I went across the street to Joe's for a slice to satisfy my pizza craving
I have NO IDEA why this place has a following
It's borderline gross
Honestly, the best pizza I have ever had
The right amount of sauce, right amount of cheese, cooked just right, amazing
Recently in new york, visited lombardi's and john's
John's pizza was average at best
It seem like something that i could make at home
Coming from chicago (where i thought chicago style pizza was the best) i was proven wrong by lombardi's pizza

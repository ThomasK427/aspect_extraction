Mine came out totally burnt and COLD! I have never sent an item back, but when I did the manager was so rude that I didn't even want a replacement
I had to complain again to get them to take it off my check
It was embarassing and unpleasant and there are too many restaurants in new york to go back
after a few dinner at cercle rouge, I didn't understood how this restaurant was not known better than this
the dinning room was filled up, but not pack, you can go to cercle rouge have a table without waiting 1 hour like some places, have a very confortable dinner with good wine
the first night we were there Mario Batali was enjoying dinner with Joaquin Phoenix and others friends
Cercle rouge is definitely an address to keep in mind
i kind of expected iffy service given it's a new restaurant
i did not expect the menu to be so oddly and over-priced
there are a few selections that are reasonable but the a la carte menu (what they call their 1-2-3 menu) is ridiculously overpriced - $40 for a small sirloin when you have to pay for each side individually at $6 each is steep for a bistro in my opinion
they were also offering dover sole for $42 which i found to be almost silly
ambience is typical bistro - noisy, bustling and fun
i will probably go back just to see if they sorted out their issues as the food was decent but if everything remains status quo, not a chance
shame given the great location
Nice decor with a good buzz in the room
Outstanding patio
Food is good- not love the homemade steak sauce- nice wine list
Cheese plate was a great choice for dessert
Looking forward to returning
I had a great meal, they serve the best chicken wings I have ever had, it was a toss up between chicken wings or oysters and I am glad I tried the wings they are like nothing I have ever had before (trust me), I had the Steak and the sauce was excellent, very nice atmosphere and a great vibe, I will definately return
Been there twice - always think worth a second try if food is good
I definitely liked the vibe in the restaurant - the food is good with enough variety to please everyone - i'd say the portions were quite skimpy where it counts - meat whether fish or steak- and for those prices this is very irksome
Perhaps it's early and they will improve but service is VERY slow - took a good 25min for waiter to take our order on both visits and the second time I was one of three tables at a 5:30pm reservation so not like it was busy
The watchful manager /owner standing right over our table seemed oblivious to this delay and when I mentioned it to him, it seemed to roll off like butter on a warm croissant
The attitude could go
Comfortable with a good elegant vibe
Fantastic patio for people watching, lots of space inside for groups of friends without losing its intimate appeal, and perfect for a date
The staff is quite charming and really makes the experience
They seem to make a lot of introductions as well which gives it a friendly social air as people seem comfortable and relaxed as they mingle outside their immediate group
They could work on their desserts but otherwise the food is excellent and they really know their wine list
Cool space; baked clams appetizer was great
Host was very nice
We order the Cote de Beuf ($55 for 2 people)
We ordered the beef medium rare
The beef was terrible
Very overcooked and dry
The fries were soggy and tasteless
In my opinion, a french bistro has to nail steak and fries
The creamed spinach was watery and bland
The aspargus were good
Someone else ordered the salmon with sides of vegetables
That dish looked very good
When the waitress asked us if we liked the steak, we politely told her the truth
She was apologetic but of course didn't do anything like send the manager over or comp us dessert or an after dinner drink
Our bill come to just under $400 for 4 people with w/ 2 bottles of decent wine
I also didn't like the fact that the bartender didn't know much about the beer on tap
after several visit at Cercle Rouge, I can only recommend the restaurant to everyone who would read this, the food is as simple as good and the quality of the product are absolutely surprising
I would qualified this restaurant as the best casual dining in town
!
I stayed at the Carlton, the hotel in which the Country reastaurant is located
First night I was tired so I ordered room service
The girl that took my order, Gabrielle, was absolutely amazing in helping me with my choices, and let me tell you, when the food came, I was amazingly surprised at the taste and quality
Second night I went back for a drink and had something there to eat again, even though I was going to another restaurant later for dinner
Amazing food and nice atmosphere, I highly recommend it!
Beautiful setting with a most tremendous and well-executed menu
Desserts are quite tasty as well
Four of us who eat out pretty much every night of the week went on a whym to Country tonight
Aside from the fact the maitre de claimed the dining room was 'full', we were seated at a great table overlooking the lobby of the hotel and ordered the 5 course tasting menu
Though expensive (which every new joint seems to be these days), the experience was more than fantastic
We requested the 'surprise' tasting menu, everything at the decision of the chef
The service, the settings, the courses, the sommelier, the atmoshphere, all were top notch
An absolute delite for clients and parents alike
Every staff member was knowledgeable of their service and product
Every dish true to it's form and taste
Truly a satisfying experience
I would suggest this restaurant to anyone in search of a culinary experience
My friend and I went to have brunch at Country a while back and it was an incredible experience
We have a couple of friends coming into town next week and we thought this would be the best place to show them a truly NY experience
The ardently decorated cafe matches their alacrid service and invigorating menu
Everyone has too at least try it once if not for the menu, then for the atmosphere
An absolutely wonderful new restaurant
Being a fan of Chef Zakarian's Town restaurant at the Chambers Hotel, I was anxiously waiting the new Country to open it's doors at the newly renovated Carlton Hotel
When they finally opened after some delays, the wait was well worth it
Madison Square park area is becoming the new Restaurant Row
The Country fits perfectly to this new wave of fine restaurants
Cafe downstairs gives a casual yet refined dining and the main dining room upstairs gives you an elegant and upscale dining experience
Even the prices and the food ingredients and preparations are quiet different on each floor, the overall feeling is the same; extremely satisfied with the ambience, service and the food
an all-around wonderful experience, in my book
the menu has some surprising -- and delicious -- comfort food options
the wait staff was knowledgeable and attentive
and the setting was sultry without being too scene-y
A+
I dont know what yall have heard of this place but i was a bit disappointed upon arrival and throughout dinner
Firstly this is nothing more than some wanna be upscale food bc its really just seats next to the bar
the beet salad that i had for appetizer was waay overdressed w vingearette and the cod i think it was, was bland bland bland
dont bother w dessert bc it was disappointing as well
i had a pineapple turnover cake type thing and it was blah to say the least
dont go
the decor isnt all that, its loud and the seats are not plush or comfy by any means
disappointing indeed
I knew the food was going to be good, but this was amazing
The service was ok, but the food made up for it
Very disappointed
I had high expectation since I'm a regular at Town
But food was good, but service is someting that needs huge improvements
First, front desk people were bunch of snobs, services uneven, food came out very fast(even before we finished our appetizers)
These little things differentiate from the great restaurant to just another good restarant
I'm sure hotel crowd will help, but wondering with so many other great restaurants, why this one
I went to Country with my boyfriend on a Friday night after work
We were looking for something romantic, but more importantly, we were looking for great food

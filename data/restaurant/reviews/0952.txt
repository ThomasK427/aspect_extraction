I told him about and then he said sorry but they're small
I kept 2 and asked for the third later
Then for dessert I asked about the three cheese plates offered
He walked away each time to find out what they were
In addition he had no personality to make up for it
The food was good, the place looks cool but don't go to the bar
EVER!
The food was exquiste
Alot of nice layering of textures and flavors going on
The bar staff left a little to be desired but
if you are there for the food and the atmosphere then that shouldn't be to big a problem
Its also versitile in that it can be very romantic or a perfect setting for a large party, just make sure to book well in advance, unless of course you know someone, wink wink ;)
I'm a big fan of the Providores Tapa Room in London, so I was expecting Public to be good
It was -- at least in the area of food
Our waiter was one of the worst I can recall encountering in NYC in recent memory
He was utterly inattentive and lackadaisical; he brought the wine *after* the food; and there was a good 30-minute wait between the first and second courses
He forgot to bring us water (after we requested it), and we poured our own wine the whole time since he never came to top our glasses
Afterwards my friend had to have a little talk with the manager about him
The food was some of the best I literally have ever had, and I think that says a lot coming from a guy who loves to eat! We did have a short wait to get seated but we drank to our hearts content with the very friendly bartenders until out table was ready
Everyone was very cordial and explained the food in detail
Its nice to see staff that knows what they are serving!
The staff was so confused as to why we were frustrated, which is exactly the problem
Cocktails arrived 20 minutes after we were seated
The menu offered unique options and my friends enjoyed their food, but my lentil avacado salad was not better or more interesting than the lunch counter at Saks and my John Dory was overcooked
One guest was surprised to discover the leftover onions from the lentil salad in his chair
Wine had to be ordered twice, coffee 3 times before everyone was served
Only after reading so many raves on this site did I feel the need to speak up
Good thing the space is so interesting because that's all you get - oh yeah, and the bill!
The food is incredible and the atmosphere is a blast
The bar is terrific as well - definitely not an afterthought
Arrive an hour early to enjoy it before dinner
Then order the duck
Delicious!!
Public is young, hot and hip
The atmosphere is stylish yet amazingly comfortable and the food is unique, adventuresome, and flavorful, in short, the kind of food we mean when we say, Don't try this at home
That being said, unlike, most happening New York spots, the folks at Public make no attempt to attitude or snobbery
I felt as welcome here as Cindy Crawford must everywhere she goes
Everything tasted delicious
The fois gras was great
Service was lacking a bit
Our glasses were empty more than once
Two in my party ordered the scallop appetizer to split, and when it arrived, literaly there was like one scallop
The waiter could have told them it wasn't enough for two
The bartenders were really good, and made the most amazing rasberry mojitos
I would go back, can't let a waiter ruin the taste of great food
Make reservations
The space is really wonderful (cool little tidbits like mailboxes and books to read while you wait!)
Saw the place in the New York Times which had rave reviews of the food so had to come
Not exactly sure what the person below was talking about with the staff because the hostesses were perfect sweeties to our party and there were 6 of us! Really good food too
You can't really miss with the salad they make with avocado and lentils which is surprising good
Also loved the lamb
Didn't know this review format existed before so i am off to rate my other favorite restaurants!
While I enjoyed the drinks, the food was pretty average and the service was absolutely rude
This place is beautiful, but really needs to get its act together on the food and service if it wants to maintain its current buzz
The appetizers are really pricey particularly once you see the size (or lack thereof)
Really need to work on the waitstaff and hostess staff, both of which are inconsistent and badly behaved
Its another NYC flash in the pan
too bad, as its a nice space
Public has a terrific atmosphere for drinks, dinner, or both
The crowd is very attractive and the food is excellent
I ordered the Scallops appetizer and the duck as a main course and loved it!  It is a great place to stop in for a couple of drinks also - beautiful and large bar area and lounge where you can order food or just have drinks
We went there for brunch recently and the place is obviously very new
We asked the waitress about some items on the menu and she had no idea what we were talking about
Then my friend ordered coffee which never showed up
After he reminded her
she said they had run out of coffee and it needed to be remade
We asked to look at the dessert menu
and she said they had run out of desserts! When we handed her the bill
she asked if we actually wanted change back! They have a ways to go before they can actually serve a decent brunch
Amazing isn't even the word; incredible food, wonderful ambience, and great decor
I can't emphasize enough how great this place is for dates, drinks, or just private parties
Everything I ate was wonderful and very unique - it had a Spanish, Italian, and even African fusion; scallions, kangaroo, venisen, and other really interesting dishes, but done so well it will blow your hair back
One would think that with this review I own the place
I wish! Oh, and this is my first Citysearch review
that's how I feel about this place! :)
The Scene  Located in the two-floor space formerly occupied by Harvest, Lobo piles on Southwestern decor that tips perilously close to being kitschy
Sombreros and spurs line the walls; banquettes are covered in a cow pattern
Still, the space emits genuine warmth, thanks in no small part to the friendly, efficient waitstaff
The Food  Portions on the appealing Tex-Mex menu are extremely generous, but flavors tend to be on the mild side
Stick to chips and salsa or a bowl of fiery chicken soup for starters; the shrimp salad offers grilled shrimp atop a heap of iceberg lettuce
The "Sassy Enchilada," as well as burritos, tacos and tamales can be pretty tame--order them extra spicy if you want some heat
It all goes down well with one of the best margaritas in the neighborhood: The spicy ancho-chili version makes a strong impression
Their mac 'n' cheese is just about perfect if you're a purist - all it is, is soothing macaroni and creamy, almost sticky, cheese sauce
Sticky doesn't /sound/ good, but it's addictive
Oh, my waistline
Also try the Georgia bean dip and the vegetarian plate
I'm from Austin, and often find myself missing the true Tex Mex I grew up eating
After seeing these good reviews, I decided to see if it lived up to the hype
I visited the Park Slope location on Fifth Avenue, and was impressed with the menu, and that they offered chicken fried steak
In the dim lighting, I thought the portions were impressive and dug in
The steak tasted a little odd, but after a few bites that I noticed it was oozing blood
When I mentioned this to the waiter, he snidely informed me that that's how it's served
No, it's not
His snark continued when I asked for the check, thanking me for my patronage
I won't be returning
I believe I have found a new neighborhood favorite
The guacamole was delicious, the chips weren't greasy
The Bartender was accommodating and very freindly to my picky friends
I can't believe how good the food is for the price and portion size you get
I usually go on Friday nights because I don't think there is any better way to relax after a hard week then with some of the best margaritas I have ever had!!!!

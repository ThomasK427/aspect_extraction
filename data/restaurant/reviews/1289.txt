Tiramisu and a chocolate cake with a warm center did us in
The staff was attentive and nice
We had an excellent time and will defintely return
I may even host a party here
There was a large group in the back that seemed to be having a blast
This place gets my thumbs up!
I had dinner here recently and really enjoyed it! The staff was attentive and helpful without being overbearing
The food was very good
I would recommend the special salad with cranberries,pine nuts and rasberry vinagrette,the calamari was excellent and I had a veal dish which was delicious
The decor is simple but beautiful
there also was a very good band playing jazz
This place has a large dining area and would be a great place for groups and it is in the heart of the heatre district
good food and good service
great location for theater
we had an office party here and it was great!
we had dinner the service was good the atmosphere was romantic but the food was average
Went to Prima Donna this past Saturday evening before a show
We were a party of four and all of us thought the food was just mediocre and the service was lacking
The room was noisy and the tables were very close together
It took the waiter 15 minutes to come to our table to take our drink order
I ordered the flounder special - the fish was fresh but the dish lacked flavor
The arugala salad was also bland
A friend was served soup that was merely warm
Another friend ordered steak that he needed to put steak sauce on because it also had little flavor
The highlight of the meal was the warm chocolate cake
We all agreed we would not return
Stay away
Overwhelmed staff
With a ressie, we still had to wait for a table
Never took our drink orders
Small portions
Go elsewhere
I was attending this club for my friend's birthday and was DENIED entrance becuase they had seen me changing into my nice shoes
My friends both came out to reason with the bouncers and they said no go! We were on a list and it was this kids birthday for godsakes! And this bouncer that denied me entrance was wearing BRIGHT RED Sneakers, as if its ok to dress casual when clearly this is not that type of place
First, I find this hypocritical, and second, to be sending the wrong message
So if you feel wasting your time waiting on line just to be judged by a punk bouncer in red kicks, you got it right here!
Good Food, beautiful place, but at 9:30 on Sat night, there we 3 tables in the place! It was quiet and empty
This place will be gone by the fall
Too bad
totally amazing is how i would sum up my evening at providence
went there with my husband and the food is just out of this world
we had these vegetable goat cheese cakes and steak that melts in your mouth
the braised short ribs were flavorful and plentiful for an appetizer, the bread pudding is better than sex
as we were leaving we noticed that there was music coming from the room on the lower level
it was the triumph room nightclub and we had so much fun dancing all night
My husband threw me a fabulous surprise 30th birthday party on Saturday night and everything was perfect! The restaurant is beautiful with a very romantic and stylish ambiance
Our party of 30 began with cocktails and delicious passed hors d'ouevres in the balcony lounge and continued in the upstairs private dining room replete with full bar and lounge area for an elegant sit-down dinner
The tables were set gorgeously with candles and a printed menu at each seat
Guests had 4 choices of appetizer (3 different salads or calamari) and entre (halibut, spinach ravioli, roasted chicken and filet mignon)all were delicious! The dessert selection was a chocolate-lovers dream! The excellent service enhanced the sophisticated atmosphere
Marcello was a gracious host who escorted our guests downstairs to a reserved alcove in the club and the party continued into the night
What a great venue! Thanks again to everyone at Providence!
Providence is definitely NYC's hidden treasure
It gives such a warm and intimate feeling - very romantic
They have a great priced prix fixe dinner (3-course dinner for $35)
can't beat that! The staff is extremely pleasant with a wonderful attitude -- we didn't want to leave! So we didn't - after dinner, we went down to the nightclub where we continued into the night
Perfect place for everything - one stop dining dancing
I am so happy I took the advice of a radio stations recommendation to visit this restaurant
To begin my visit I entered into a most beautiful atmosphere
From the hostess who seated my partner and I for cocktails, to our waiter Lasco, everything was perfect
Wine choices were made to compliment our meal; the manager Sal was delightful and very professional as he visited each guest to ensure their satisfaction, and our food from appetizer to entre was to die for
I live in New Fairfield, CT so you can imagine a city event is a well-planned venture, and this restaurant will be visited again as well as recommend to my friends who like fine dinning with resonable prices
Thank you again Providence staff - you and your restaurant are a win win situation
Sincerely, SJS
Midtown was needing a place like Providence
Amazing food, attentive staff and great ambiance all makes Providence great for a date
My boyfriend flipped out over the raw bar and the steak was grilled perfectly
We are so pleased, we're thinking of having a large group dinner for our friends
Definitely need to check this place out!
I cannot say enough good things about my experience at Providence
I arranged a birthday party for 20 people in the main dining room and the experience was flawless
The table was ready before we arrived, the service was great and the food was delicious
Sal, the maitre d', took outstanding care of us from the moment we walked in until the moment we left
After dinner I reserved a table downstairs for bottle service and was given a larger area than I had requested
Our waitress in the Triumph Room was very attentive and we even received a bottle of champagne from Sal as a thank you for our business
I would highly recommend as an all-inclusive, great night out!
If youre planning on celebrating a special occasion with a group of friends I recommend dinning at Providence
The Major D, Sal is personable most accommodating
He catered to our partys every need
The menu had something for everyone, such as: seafood, steak and pasta; affordable prices with portions that wont make you leave hungry
The ambiance is fancy during dinning hours turned trendy; Providence turns into a club, Triumph (two other floors open up)
Our entire group was granted free admission to the club, it was great not have to try to get 12 people into a club/lounge after dinner; hence the review title
Ive been going out in the city for thirteen years; I consider myself to be a tough critic however this past Saturday I was impressed
My friends kept complimenting me all night for an incredible evening and all I did was make a reservation!
We went to celebrate our anniversary
We were bowled over by the beauty of the restaurant, the food and the sweet staff
Reccomended!
This is a fantastic place
We are familiar with the Chef's reputation from way back and were anxious to try her new venture
I wasn't prepared for the stunning atmosphere, so grand and cozy at the same time, very special for this part of the city
The food was as magnificent as we had hoped, service friendly and helpful, well-timed
The whole experience worked to make an enchanting evening for my small group of friends
To prove my point, there was a wedding proposal at the next table! (She accepted
)
We were lucky enough to get invited for New Years Eve and WOW this place was amazing! I couldn't believe it was the old Le Bar Bat we had grown up on
The space was so fantastic that once we heard they were serving dinner we decided to go one night and try it out
We've been back 3 times since - the food and the experience(s) just keep getting better!
There isn't a place like this in the city
Walking into the place seems like your walking into a lobby of a hotel
but once you get to the end of the hallway and see the dining room
it's quite a surprise

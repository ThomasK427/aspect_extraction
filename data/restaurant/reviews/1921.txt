Authentic Pakistani food
People are always friendly
Don't waste money on decor
Just straight up cheap, good food
The thing is, if you're exhausted after a whole morning and afternoon of shopping, Le Petite Cafe isn't home of the heartiest meal
It's a charming, dainty little niche of a cafe, not grand eatery
For a place its size, the American/Italian menu is rather large
But the coffees, lattes, especially the chai latte, are fabulous to sip on particularly from the window seats
Desserts are not baked on premise, but the assortment and quality of the baked goods are great
Pop in for something warm to drink and tasteful to nibble on
I have no idea why the 2 previous reviews are so bad! I have eaten here twice - both times for a quick lunch
You can get a fairly large portion of yummy pasta (spinach and cheese tortellini or penne with vegetables) for less than $10
the service wasn't bad, either
In fact, I noticed that the waitress kept glancing over at my table to see if we were ready for the check
She didn't schlep over and repeatedly ASK if we were ok, but I consider that a good thing
This establishment looks very sweet from the outside but that's about all it has to offer
I found the service to be mediocre (very unenthusiastic unless they knew you), the food was very ordinary too
While it wasn't horrible, for some reason, the whole expereince really turned me off the place and I doubt I'll ever return
To be fair, it probably isn't a bad place to stop for a coffee - especially if you can sit outside but I wouldn't bother eating there
This place looks like a cozy little cafe with nice character
Unfortunately it just sucks
My friend and I went in on a nice, crisp fall day and decided to have some apple cider
Apparently in Le Petite Cafe-land, apple cider means luke warm apple juice with half a stick of cinnamon in it
When my friend's chicken salad sandwich arrived, she noticed a nice crust, and it wasn't part of the bread
Whilst trying to send it back the manager said she would still have to pay for half the sandwich
Bad move on their part
We're never going there again, and now it's our mission to spare other diners from a similar fate
Consider yourself warned
My sister and I decided to have dinner at L'Ulivo
We were able to sit outside
Once we got seated the wait staff were very pushy
Instead of ordering a appetizer each and an entree each we decided to split it
We ended up getting both the appetizer and entree at the same time
I felt like they wanted us to eat and run
Leave NYC for the afternoon or evening and dine in Campania
Order the foccaccia basket to start and you will instantly be hooked
One of the best values for consistent quality food and a wonderful atmosphere
A surprising value in Soho and a nice date
Great food in a small, warm inviting space with great waiters
There's nothing more you could possibly ask for on a low-key, relaxing night out
Try the pizza, gnocchi they are excellent, staples such as angel hair pasta I would not order
everything about this place was awesome, except the service was so so
our bill came to 71 bucks for two people and that included a beer, 2 apps, 2 entrees 2 desserts and a cappuccino
we will def go back
Went here for a little get together
The place was nice and small and the dim lights gave a nice sense of the room
Although the food was in small portions, it was good
The waiters were nice and friendly
My favorite though was the dessert it was terrific
It is a bit pricey
I'm not the pizza person but L'Ulivo's pizzas are GREAT! Along with salad or any other appetizer its a nice meal! Simple tasty!
this is my buddy's girlfriend's favorite restaurant
it's right on spring street so it's easy to get to, although their name is difficult to remember i always seem to misspell it
my friend and his girlfriend get the same thing all the time; the shrimp salad and the salmon pasta
those dishes are good
my salad nicoise was great
they can't mess up the pizza
i got the gnochhi and it tasted like mush
my other friend got pasta with lobster it was average and he had to wrestle with the lobster as it was in it's shell
waiters are nice but aren't helpful with the menu, they like everything
it's obvious somethings were better than others
my recommendation is to get a salad and a pizza
wine selection and beer selection is below average
the prices were very reasonable so i definitely would go back for a nice lunch
this little cafe has a real italian the village cafe type of feel
it's quaint, cozy, a little small and cramped
the food was prompt and the coffee was good
the service was helpful and not at all rude
i probably wouldn't go back again because i think i could find better ambiance food somewhere else
Reggio appears to be a cute intimite cafe, look again
Recently, I passed the cafe and noticed nice atmosphere -People talking, writing, reading, and USING laptop computers
Came back later to do work with my small laptop when a man approached demanding do You know who I am? Confused I said no-he proceeded to say he was the cafe owner that I was not to use my comp
in his cafe
He was extremly rude and when I asked the waitress if there was a sign advising not to use laptops, she said no
The owner asked the waitress what I said and then proceeded to shout profanity at me from the entrance of the caf
Of course he waited till after i order the extremly overpriced coffe and dessert
SAVE YOUR MONEY- RUDE SERVICE, OWNER, OVERPRICED
try the italian bakery or many friendly cafes around the corner
The chairs are really uncomfortable and the space is a bit cramped
What more could make this place feel like a real Italian cafe? We went for brunch
the mozzarella and prosciutto omelette was really good but the eggs benedectine were below par
The coffee is great and the wait staff has a very laid back and casual attitude
The prices are phenomonal for the area! It's worth a try
The pastries were stale--too stale to finish! We were expecting the usual high quality one has grown accustomed to in city cafes
While the atmosphere was dark and inviting, it didn't make up for the disappointment
Our coffee was fine, but we felt extremely ripped-off by the experience
We told our server our desserts weren't very good, and she nodded in agreement
Needless to say, there are too many good cafes in the city to return to this one
I loved Cafe Reggio when I was in high school
Went back recently - the day of the Coin Ed explosion power-outage
it was better than ever
The food was great and when the bill for three came - I couldn't believe it! The prices looked the same as when was a school girl
Probably not - but
Wow! It had the same charm and magic
It's sad to say that I have to give this cafe a low rating, because I've been going there for years
However, my experience today has left me sad
The manager asked us not to play cards and proceeded to not provide a reason
What's up with that? No gin rummy? But you can read and write? What is the difference? Therefore, if you like to play any games, and prefer to be in with a warm, friendly environment, go elsewhere
For this place has changed
This is no longer the place it used to be

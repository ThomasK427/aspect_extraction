I wouldn't reccommend ever going out of your way for this spot, nor eating anything other than pizza
I once made the mistake of getting a Gyro from them - one of the many bad food decisions i've made in my lifetime
I was born and raised in Brooklyn and for most of my life I lived on Ocean Parkway (between Beverly Rd and Church Avenue)
Everytime I bought a slice or a pie of pizza it was at Korner Pizzeria
I've tried Pizza in all 5 boroughs of New York City and I can assure you this is the best
I moved out to California in early 2000 and everytime I go home to visit where do you think I buy pizza? My husband who's a California native also swears it's the BEST slice of pizza he's ever had
Pizza's always just the way we like it
Crispy crust, delicious sauce
Friendly service
Nice neighborhood pizzeria
Lots of faithful regulars
Not just pizza, heroes, salads, pasta dishes, everything you can imagine
It tastes like the food you eat at home for Sunday dinner
It's a real local favorite
Friendly, family environment
You will love it go back for more
They make you feel like family,and the food is to die for
I recommend trying Grandma's pizza beleave me your go back for more
I have been going to roocos for years now, sadly not as often as i'd like but thats what makes it special
The calamari, the penne and vodka sauce, the friendly service the parking and the open area kitchen to see all the action in the making! Dont be surprised if this place gets alot more press soon

I was there for the first time with my husband/kids for dinner
We all enjoyed our dinners
The atmosphere is great, casual dress code, parking on premises, tables and chirs are outside for your preference
ROCCO'S, THE BEST CALAMAR,AND ARTICHOCKE
I HAVE NOTHAD ANY BETTER
YOU WALK IN AND ROCCO SEATS YOU AND IT BEGINS
I WENT WITH FOUR CHILDREN MY GIRLFRIEND AND MYSELF AND IT WAS VERY REASONABLE AND STUFFED AS THEY SAY FORGETABOUTIT! IT'S JUST A MUST TRY!!!
Hidden in Borough Park, in Brooklyn that is not a tourist destination, Vostok represents a great example of Russian-Eastern restaurant
If you've been to Middle East then you'll know what I am talking about
It is not a luxury, shining restaurant with waitstaff in taxidos
It is a small place decorated in traditional Uzbeki style - you do feel like you are somewhere in Middle East
Food is great there, if you are a meet lover and love shish kabobs, nan, shurpa, manty ans somsa
It is cheap too
Word of advise - if you like Wolfgang Puck, Aqua, or other hip and trendy places - do not come even close that place
This is another world
I love this pizza shop i think they have the best pizza in brooklyn
the service is great, the men who work there are very nice
I like my neighborhood pizza better than both Di Fara's and L B
The crust is nice and crispy and the sauce and cheese go well together
The veggie delight pizza is also very good, though sometimes they don't heat it up enough
I haven't tried anything else there; I'm just talking about the pizza
One time I got pizza delivered and it took a really long time, but I think it was on a holiday or something
Its the best italian pizza made in a kosher parlor
The pizza is made by an Italian master pizza chef
There are tons of Savoy Bakeries around the city but this one is exemplary -- clean, well-run, amply stocked, well-staffed, and VERY inexpensive, it's a great local bakery
There are muffins and cakes to order, of course bu talso a wide range of buns, jello desserts, puddings, tarts and all kinds of little treats, artfully created and beautifully displayed -- you never know what imagainative new delicacy will be there
Staff is pleasant, too
there is nothing remarkable or fancy about this resturant
What makes this Sunset Park restuarant a true winner is the FOOD
This is the best roasted chicken on earth
along with the Beans, rice con gandules and the Yucca
This is a very local spot, with lots of merengue and salsa music
You can order to go,sit at the counter, also, there is table space in the rear as well
Worth the trip to Sunset Park!
It's a pleasent suprise to get hearty portions, comfortable seating and very nice service when the neighborhood doesn't yet offer more
This is the place to go in Sunset Park
This pleasant Bay Ridge diner offers one of the archetypal NY experiences
From the overstuffed menu to the placemats advertising spectacularly festive drinks, to the comfy booths, the decor signals -- this is indeed your grandfather's diner and thank goodness for it
Great Italian entrees, in super-sized portions, and lots and lots of sides, make this a local favorite and a solid diner classic
I have to admit, I didn't expect much when I came in here, though the storefront's a step up from some of the others on this crowded Fifth Avenue strip
But I was pleasantly surprised -- the food was fast, cheap--and definitely better than places like Taco Bell would have you believe possible
Well worth a try if you're in the neighborhood
I've been to take out places with better service and food
Came here on Chinese New Year with a large group
Arrive at 7:00pm, the waiters didn't give us our menus till an 1 1/2 hour later
We place our orders and waited for the food to arrive for over an hour
Meanwhile, people who came after us were being served first and we were still waiting
Finally, we complained to the manager and he told them to rush our food out
This is now at 10:00pm, 3 hours after we arrived
The food was undercoooked
The only thing that was decent was the steamed broccoli, but no one can ruin steamed broccoli!!! We left, paying for only what we ate and refusing to leave a tip!!! Never coming here again!!!
The food is good but the service is unbearable
The waitress and waiters pretend that they dont see you and when you finally get their attention, they are upset at you for bothering them
Typical diner food but good
Get plenty on food for the price
Needs to improve and make it more modern
Starting to look old and not taken care of
The place is nice to go to but you can always improve
The food is good and the drinks are OK but on the expensive side
Oh yeah, It took a long time to find parking!
The place was nice and my girlfriend and I definately enjoyed ourselves - but weren't blown away
There was a private party in the garden, which I'm told is rare, so the only tables for 2 were in the main room, it was so dark we could barely read the menu, but it was nice and kind of romantic
The abience is very nice
My girlfriend had a margarita she said was ok, and I had a soda that somehow tasted terrible, like the line was dirty
The chips were tasty
the steak and chicken fajitahs were good, a bit too much sauce on the meat for my taste
The other dish was arroz con pollo, the chicken was delicions and the rice was a greasy but good
The bill was low 50's, pricey for what we got
I had a good time and would go back, but won't rush to
I went to Casa Pepe on Saturday with a group of 8
First, our reservation was lost
but they were nice about it and got us a table within 20 minutes
I would like to say it was wonderful from there, but the truth is that the service was HORRIBLE
We waited forever to get our order taken
We waited FOREVER for the food
We even waited forever for coffee! We got at the restaurant at 8:00 and left at 11:30
Ridiculous!  I would recommend this restaurant only if you have extreme patience or if you're someone who can keep on top of servers to make sure things arrive quickly
If you can deal with that, then definitely go there - the food, while overshadowed by the terrible service, was outstanding
Our table gave rave reviews to the paella, steak, ribs and the beef chimichangas

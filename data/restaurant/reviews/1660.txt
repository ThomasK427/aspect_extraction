The millet pancakes come with fresh beet salad, which was delicious
There are four spaces to choose from (in the evening, when it is not as crowded as at brunch): the outside patio, the entry room (cramped), the inner room (friendly), and the back room (romantic)
For a date, I recommend the back room--unless there is a party going on, so ask first
My friends and I were regular brunchers at Orlin until we went with a group of 8
The service was horrible
They took my order but didn't put it in and told me it was my fault that I didn't give my order (but I did and received the drinks that came with it)
I didn't get my food until everyone was finished
The waitress dropped the check, didn't add gratuity, and reminded us that 20% is the usual tip (as if we have never dined out before)
We miscalculated the bill and ended up only leaving 10% (we planned to leave 20%) and the waitress made someone else follow us out to ask if everything was ok
We told her we made a mistake and would give more but since she asked, the service was terrible
She said Well, it is brunch at Cafe Orlin
I quit this place
check out the chocolate cake, with a glass of sparkling raspberry lemonade
i would pass up a margarita any night for the lemonade-it is absolutely divine
this cafe is a great date spot and is probally my favorite in all of manhattan
also-in the summer, check out the alley cat who walks on the awning outside and slinks between the tables
I've had brunch all over the city and this place is the best
Always consistent - the most perfect poached eggs, excellent service, and extremely affordable
Crowded, yes, but worth the wait
I went to the cafe not knowing what to expect
The place was great! We were seated promptly and the people are so friendly
The brunch was delicious (the specials are definitely worth the money)
I am from Miami, FL but I go to NY about 2-3 x's a year each time I visit the big apple, I have to make a stop at Cafe Orlin! I love the Huevos Rancheros the MUST HAVE - Pumpkin Pancakes w/Cinnamon Yogurt
YUUUUUM!! I recently took my friend who went to NY for the first time she agreed with me! It'll be our Brunch place for a very long time!!
this is a great place to dine with friends or even by yourself
It's laid back casual atmosphere is nice
The food is tasty
but the service is horrible
Let me explain
you get your water immediately, the food pretty quickly
but after that the waiter just forgets about you
if you want a refill on drinks, dessert, or anything else after you receive your meal, good luck hunting down your waiter! You'd be better off just telling them before hand that you'd like x number of drinks or that you will be interested in dessert after the meal
Still worth going though
I greatly enjoyed my meal here
This is the perfect place to eat brunch or dinner
Their food is mediteranean influenced and very unusual
I ate here several times and new comers are always pleased
The servers are very underdressed and a little bit strange, but give decent service
I highly recommend the mimosas here
Prices were affordable, service was good, and I was amazed at the flavor of the food
I have to say I wasn't expecting much from this St
Marks locale, but I was delightfully surprised
Went for dinner around 9pm on a Sunday night and sourdough bread they brought right away was warmed to perfection and delicious
My walnut crusted salmon was melt in your mouth delicious and my friend's falaffel and hummus were equally good
We sat outside and watched the passersby - cute, casual, romantic-y surroundings
Will definitely be back for another chill meal
This place is perfect
A five minute walk from home to some of the tastiest and best priced comfort food in all of NYC
Its not a scene, its a great neighborhood place where friends (and even family) can gather together for good times
Cafe Orlin has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants!
this is the place to go to meet up with friends or even for a relaxed date (not fancy enough for first date tho)
the food is great and the prices are very reasonable
try the mushroom ravioli, the hangar steak, indonesian chicken, chicken shnitzel and the curry split pea soup
Cafe Orlin ROCKS! They have tasty food, great coffee and tea-based beverages and an eclectic NY Atmosphere
And, best of all, (Some would say worst) youcan still smoke in the back room
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!
Cafe Orlin is THE most comfortable restaruant I can say that I have been to
Not only do I feel quite at home, relaxed, and happy whenever I go there; their food is GREAT!!! Their staff is wonderful
no fancy dressing, just relaxed and ready to serve their customers
Their prices are reasonable, and you should NEVER leave without taking a look at the desert menu
Cafe Orlin is a place to enjoy!!!
this place is the best
Food is great also all workers are sooooooo professional!! Nothing bad about this place!!
A place in NYC where you can eat nice food , in a nice environment , where they have a smoking section
and who's complaining about the waitresses being too slow?
At least , you can sit in peace there without having the feeling HURRY !!!NEXT!!!!
I simply hate it when they come and take your plate from under your nose and push the bill under instead when you're still chewing
HHhmmm
Americans should learn a little about table manners
So , for my part
Ladies
take it easy
you're doing a great job! I'm a regular at Orlin's each time i'm in NYC
Never I had a remark
not on the food , not on the service
The spicy tomato soup, the carrot cake, lemon chicken
and hell
the Omelette with cream cheese and salmon for breakfast is heaven!
The food is consistently good and there is enough variety to satisfy carnivores AND pesky vegetarians alike:-) My favorite is the hanger steak - done to med-rare perfection! The ambience is typical of the neighborhood, crowded tables and can be quite noisy at times but overall, it's a great place for a casual date or when you don't have the courage to try a new place and just want good, decent fare without the high price tag
Don't be in a hurry, though
The wait staff are WAY too funky to care about good service
In Short This bar is of the small, dark, East Village lounge variety, with plenty of couches and a super-loud sound system, which features everything from R
I had a birthday get together there with friends a Sat night
No Admission is a big plus , good atmosphere, bar tenders were nice
Drinks were not bad for NYC , though bottled beer is expensive
Music good a lot of hip-hop, some old school
Could use more raggae and raggaeton
It is a small place and it does get crowded
Stay away from DJ , he had an attitude
I have been hanging out at this spot for over 10 years and it has always had the same relaxed, laied back atmosphere
Just what you need
You can stand up and get your groove on or just sit and chill
I love that about this place!!
Nice place
The drinks were a bit expensive, but that's Lower Manhattan for you
The music coulda been better, and there were defintely some weirdos dancing in the back
The place does have a lot of potential
more hip-hop needed
The place seemed like it had some potential, though it was empty the night I was there
Seems like a great place to bring a group of friends if you're in the area

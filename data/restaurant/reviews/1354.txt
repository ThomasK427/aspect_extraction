It was a mountain of food
The pecan pie was great
I was very comfortable
I had a bit of a problem with the staff topping our wine glasses and charging us for a full glass each time
If we'd wanted a bottle we would have ordered a bottle
I reall thought that they were being generous on Thanksgiving
The bill came to $220
00 with tip
Way too expensive for this
It was supposed to be $58 prix fixe
It is a true pleasure to discover a secret hideaway where insiders can enjoy delicious food and drinks in a setting that is both grand and sexy, depending on the table you choose
The menu offers classic and creative options to satisfy all tastes--my favorite was the crispy battered Maine Lobster Tail! Try the Alchemist Cocktail for a great start to your evening and about 20 nice wines by the glass to complement the diverse menu choices
Divine desserts include housemade ice cream that changes flavors with the season
Everyone at the club trys hard to ensure you have a memorable experience and they succeed!
Apparently a new restaurants with lots of kinks to work out
The food was mediocre, at best
There is no salt and pepper on the tables
The music blares as though it wants to be a night club
A man in his late thirties came over and spoke to us about wine
He was accomodating and knowledgeable, explaining the list was still in progress
I hope so
Because now that wine list is the funniest list in New York
He seems to have the knowlege and skill to fix it
For the sake of the Dylan Hotel, I hope so
The one good point was a young waitress, who knew what she was doing
She appeared to be a true pro, but until they fix their other problems, professional servers like her will refuse to be embarrassed

I went there with 6 guests on friday evening expecting the same quality food as the other nobus like the ones in down town and LA
First, the atmosphere reminds me of the dimsum places in Hong Kong, large scale and posh but not stylish
very loud and huge dining room
not my favorite
very touristy
not a place for New Yorkers! Secondly, the food was very disappointing
I started with the ceviche nobu style
I couldn't tast anything else but ginger and vinegar
terrible
and the miso sauced cod, it was OK
(my favorite local japanese restaurent Roppongi has the same dish and actally tast better and half price)
and I had sushi dinner as a main dish,the fish was dry and paper thin(not appetiting!)and the rice was as hard as a rock
not any better than the sushi express fast food store near my work
obviousley they had no idea of the art of sushi,not to mention there was a cooked shrimp shushi on my sushi dinner plate in this upscale Japanese retaurent
And our last hope desert
I had bento box
again dry,chocolate cake wasn't impressive
Even fruits in fruit plate was terrible
they were not ripe
None of us was happy with our measl
almost all the food was salty as well
If you know about Japanese food, you won't like this place
It was a toal disappointment
I came in with friends on a Sunday evening
First we were informed that they wouldn't give us seating in the dinning room for 5 because only 4 of us were present (they weren't busy), then they informed us that they stopped seating in 10 minutes
No matter, we moved to the bar and ordered some sushi
I got an extremely limp California hand roll that I would have sent back in my Seattle sushi place, and my companion asked that they put Ikura in her Salmon skin roll
After about 45 minutes they came back to inform us that it was impossible to add Ikura to a Salmon skin roll
They are rumoured to have 7 sushi chefs on duty, although I haven't confirmed this, but that doesn't seem to be all that challenging a request
Anyway, Sushi was not good, service was slow, and the attitude unhelpful
Maybe it was just a bad night, but not a place I'd ever go back to
I took my girlfriend to Nobu 57 last Saturday for her birthday
Let me start with the two most important areas: Food and Service
The food was great with very unique tastes
We ordered a number of dishes, which kept coming one after the other in great order and timing, and I have to say that each one of them was magnificent
In addition, service was impeccable! Our waitress kept around the table in a very discreet manner to see when we would finish the dishes on the table so that she can place the order for the next ones! As I said before, we ordered a number of dishes, which at some point towards the end, we started feeling full
As soon as the waitress noticed that we slowed down, she asked if everything was okay; once we told her that we were getting full, but we still wanted to try the susho at the end, she said that she wadn't placed the order in for the last of the dishes we had ordered and asked us if we wanteded to move straight to the sushi
Let me tell you, I have been to some of the best restaurants in a number of cities, and nothing like this has ever happened before
It was truly as if we had our own personal waitress and cook for that matter
The ambience and atmosphere is very nice and unique
Very hip, stylish, hot! The crowd was also very ecclectic and hip
I have been to the Nobu in Las Vegas too, but I liked this one much better
Deserts were amazing, and they did not forget the little candle and wish for my girlfriend
The Drinks were out of this world! Overall, a great dining experience!!! If you don't mind the price, it's worth a visit
Great ambiance
The waitstaff was very knowledgable and freindly
The food was good but not Amazing
Fast service, good cocktail
Great place to see celebs
Half way though our dinner we realized Matt Damon was eating at the next table
No one in the restarant bothered him, Very cool to see he can just eat his meal at certain places
This restaurant has a great atmosphere
The dinning area is a large space that is well decorated
The bar on the first floor has a great ambiance as well
My table ordered a few dishes to share and I noticed that the service was extremely fast
I felt like we closed our menus and the first dish came out
When we were done with that, the 2nd dish was served immediately
Fast service is always a plus, however I felt a little rushed towards the end of our meal
Next time I think I'm going to add dishes onto our order as the dinner goes on instead of ordering everything at once
Overall the quality of the food was excellent and I will definitely return
I've been dining in Manhattan, as well as all over the world, for 50 of my 60 years
I've seen great restaurants, and I've seen garbage
This one is an interesting combination of both
The food is generally outstanding--a couple of dishes struck out, but mostly they were out of the park
But this is a factory for wannabes, and I don't wannabe treated the way the rest of the patrons here don't seem to mind--awestruck by pure 100% affectation, and service that wouldn't make it in White Castle (which, actually isn't all that bad)
The downtown branch is great
You'd be better off waiting to eat down there and have intelligent, well-informed service than going to this branch
Love the food and the service
The place is amazing
Best meal of my life, hands down
EVERYTHING was fantastic
I would go everyday if I could afford it
Must try

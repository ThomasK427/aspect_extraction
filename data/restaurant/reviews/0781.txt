the restaurant is bit on the pricey side but it's totally worth it and my friends and I highly recommend it thanks Yujin for making my friend's birthday memorable
I've visited Yujin several times and every time I visit, I'm impressed with its modern take on Japanese food
It seems that every time I visit, the chef manages to add new and exciting dishes to the menu and my experiences at Yujin have been nothing but pleasing and satisfying
the staff is very friendly and attentive
They also are well-educated/trained in the menu that they serve
Try the tuna tartar, one bite and you will keep coming back
Beautiful decor
Service was horrible
We made reservations and did not get seated until 20 minutes later
We order our had to remind waitress about several drink orders
Food was not served until an hour later
Other tables around were complaining also
Surely enough our food was served with missing orders
three out of our six orders were missing
The waitress didn't mention anything until after the fact
We ran out
sorry! Was frequently used
To top that off
I ordered dessert and it was they gave me the wrong flavor of ice cream
Couldn't she have told me before ordering
(oops, I ran out) We spent close to $300 for 6 meals got at the restaurant at 9:30 left sometime past 12:00 am!!! If I ever visit NY again
I would not ever come back to this place
Yujin has high aspirations, and one would expect service on par with their prices
They called me twice in 2 weeks to bump up our seating time from my original reservation
Upon arrival, we were shuttled to our seats without a word from the host (and not offered the option of checking in our coats)
We ordered the 5-course prix fixe menu
After the second course, our waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything else and if she could bring our cheque for us
I had to remind her that we hadn't yet finished our meal
When the third course arrived, we were not given any silverware
Our water glasses went unfilled for half the meal as well
Right now, I probably would not return to Yujin
Maybe these are problems with an inexperienced staff, but there are too many good restaurants in this city to bother returning
The food is so good here
Try the tuna and shrimp tempura
The chopsticks on the wall are great to look at
Yujin was fabulous - one of my favorite restaurants in the city
My boyfriend and I had pumpkin miso soup (delicious
that day's special, probably not available every night), eel tempura house specialty sushi (a little expensive but it was huge and so very delicious), tempura shrimp roll with excellent spicy mayonnaise on the side and rock shrimp dumplings (also delicious)
i'd highly recommend the whole red snapper dish as an entree
for dessert, you cant go wrong with green tea mousse tower and warm chocolate cake
all in all one of my best dinign experiences in the city
btw it was so reasonably priced too - a little over 100 bucks for two people
Fabulous food and passionate service! You will be impressed by the vast selection of sushi/sashimi (try the otoro), all served fresh and succulent
They offer unique specials (salmon with a pumpkin sauce in lieu of Halloween!) The presentation is meticulous, expressing a 4-star cuisine
I recommend the sushi/sashemi combinations and tell the server what you like
Great date place!
Delicious! Was impressed by the pleasant combination of food drinks offered here
Had a lovely time!
I've enjoyed my multiple visits due to the balance of the interesting modern design, attentive and knowledgable service, and the consistent quality and freshness of the menu
Getting bored with the mundane Japanese fare at those unexceptional sushi places all over the city? This is a great restaurant for those people who want to taste some creative Japanese in a hip atmosphere
It's a step above Sushi Samba in my opinion
Be warned that the prices are kind of high, but not as high as Nobu
and in my opinion the food is at the same level
I've been twice so far and love the ceviche, tuna ravioli, sea bass, and green tea creme brulee
Service is first rate and friendly
Fantastic
really great looking spot
the food was good, but not great
the sushi was way too small and pricey, but nonetheless very tasty
the shrimp dumplings in the corn chowder broth was interesting, but while the food was quite good, the experience was tuined by the complete breakdown of service
but i would go back b/c its hip and tasty, and maybe the service wont be so bad next time
I went to dinner at Yugin the second week it opened
The services was horrible, but as a result they comped us for all of our drinks (can't complain)
The food was really good
It reminded me of a more romantic Sushi Samba
I would definitly recommend going there once they get all of the kinks out
Yujin would do very well in outta-nyc
Overall was a pleasant but I wonder how long they would last in this economy w/o special elements
liked how every day spices brought out special flavors in simple dishes
i had tasted the followings: soft crab shells, rock shrimp dumpling soup, tuna tartar then had maki rolls
for main course, i had seabass with hijiki
and had tasted friends' dishes too
$3 per plate if you were to bring your own cake
Vera their pastry chef does a superb job in surprising you with awesome selection
somehow the place reminded me of Fresh, Commune and Blue fin combined a bit
overall i loved their friendliness and non-pushy or stuck up attitudes
And yes, their chopstick ceiling is an innovative idea  one more thing
I LOVED their cranberry juice
unlike other places, it was not tart
I have been to several sushi restaurants throughout the city- both expensive/high quality and inexpensive- and I must say that I thought the food at Yujin was right up there with the best sushi around
I have only one complaint- the service was too attentive
almost annoyingly attentive
I found it difficult to keep the conversation flowing around the table because the waiters wouldnt leave us alone (there were several waiters per table which was unnecessary)
Otherwise, I thought the food was great and I would definitely go back
i love haciende
it was my first time in there
everthing was excellent
Finally somebody got it right a steakhouse which is romantic and comfortable! I came to this resturant because it got Best new steak house in New York City in Time out Mag
and I am thrilled I did
One of the most romantic resturants in NYC
What a delight when our food
This resturant truly has the best prime sirloin! No butter like the other top steak houses do in order to trick you that the meat is good
I spoke to the manager who by the is Argentinian and he told me that the meat is grilled not broiled like most to resturants do in order to cheat! The empanadas were great and the gnocci was some of the best I have had! The service was friendly, knowagble and warm
Overall this is a small little gem of a resturant!
Ambiance: Upon entering the place you feel like Morticia Adams will appear out of the dark corners any moment to replace the wax dripping candelabra in the middle of the table
instead you get a very curt hostess who makes it clear that Spanish is not spoken here
Price: The lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $8
95 was a heavy fennel flavored Italian sausage like the ones that sell for $2
99/lb at the store
The real chorizo at any respectable Argentine restaurant costs about $2

Want to hang out? Try the bar
I first stumbled upon this great Spanish restaurant with a friend a few years ago, while roaming the meatpacking district
It doesn't loook like much from the outside, but once you step inside the cozy and romantic atmosphere lends to such an authentic Spanish feel, reminicent of tapas bars I frequented while traveling through Spain
There's a beautiful mural on the walls of the dining room- not many places like this left in the city
I go often and the food is consistently excellent, even their house salad dressing is something to write home about
I especially enjoy the Paella Marinara and the Chicken Villarroy
And don't forget the sangria- it's delicious
This place is great to go with a group of friends or to impress a date
You won't be disappointed!
The place is really crowded and noisy and the staff's emphasis seems to be on turning over the tables
The service was subpar with the waiters acting either indifferent, brusque or downright rude
If you can overlook that, the sangria is good and the food (save for the garlic bread, which seemed a bit charred) was excellent
We enjoyed a range of dishes, including shrimp, beef and paella
If you like historic places, this one's been around since the 1920s
My boyfriend took me to El Faro for our Valentine's Day dinner
Knowing the fact that I love sangria and spanish food, this place was pretty incredible
Because the restaurant is so old and small, it gave it a sense of authencity and underground-like feel; like you're actually in Spain
The eating area was pretty small but cozy
My boyfriend ordered the classic paella and I had a broiled sirloin steak
Both were terrific
I normally had sweeter tasting sangria, but maybe this is how they are actually made? It's pretty much wine and slices of oranges
Definitely a ideal place to be with small parties
And we ended it off with a mouth-watering Natilla
Over the years, I've frequently dined at El Faro and the food is consistent
Although their cuisine is flavorful, there is much to do about space and decor
All in all, a great place to chow down
El faro was awesome
i went with my boyfriend, who lives in Spain, and my parents, who had gone to El faro before and raved about it
i knew it was going to be a good time when we were waiting for a table and my boyfriend noticed that the El faro 'logo' was actually the city crest of La Coruna, the city where my boyfriend is from
El faro means the lighthouse, just in case you were curious
referring to the lighthouse in La Coruna (it was built long long ago by the romans)
anyhow, the restaurant is great
it was cozy and had a happy vibe
the waiters seemed happy to be there, which was cool, and they also had Estrella Galicia beer
we were psyched
the tortilla was good, the sangria also
over all, it was as close to authentic spanish dining as i've gotten here in the states
I've been visiting El Faro Rest
for the last 20 yrs
and let me tell you what a wonderful place is
If you want to know what a Paella, sangria, margarita is, you must visit this tiny but delicious and full of taste restaurant
Waiters, bartenders and every single person that works in this restaurant know what the customers like and always are there to make you feel good
No wonder this place is been in business for 77 yrs
and the way they treat people and specially us (new yorkers) I can bet anyone that they are goin to survive for 70 yrs
more
Once again thank you to all personal from El Faro Rest
for being so kind an hard worker
God bless you all and also your wonderful menu

I have been visiting El Faro for the past twelve years and every time is a different but awesome experience!!! The service is great, the atmosphere is accomodating and the food is Excellent!!! I recommend trying the new Malibu drink, excellent and perfect for the summer
This quaint old place feels like the 70+ year old family business it is billed as, but unfortunately resting on their laurels is something they have obviously become accustomed to
After sitting at the bar for half an hour waiting for a table (which I don't mind too much for a small place that does not take reservations), drinking some of the best sangria I have had in the City, we were seated
This led to the worst paella I've ever had, with pre-cooked tasting rice and dry tastless shrimps
Truly horrible
My wife had $20 chilean sea bass, which was so over cooked it was as dry as a chicken breast, floating in a swamp of tastless white translucent sauce
No-one asked if our food was OK, we had to wave for a waiter to send it back
We'll never be back
Went with high expectations
Loved the ambience
Food was delicious, but would have been much better if the shrimp and lobster had not been overcooked
Loved the garlicky sauces! Sangria delicious
Try and find a better paella or mariscada dish in NY
Be warned though - they like to use lots of garlic
Cosy old fashioned atmosphere and huge portions make it hard to beat
Their salad dressing (which they also sell for only $2 a bottle!) is unique
El Faro is the ultimate experience, combining good food with a great atmosphere and ever better sangria
Last time i was there on a friday night, a mariachi band came in and the waiters participated in traditional Spanish songs
haven't been there in a while but if i remember correctly the food was exquisite! try the paella with some sangria
you won't be sorry
I also wandered in here a few months ago and loved the ambiance: it is softly lit and very cozy with wooden floors and booths
But I was very unhappy with the food
I ordered ravioli which I think was priced and listed as a meal but turned out to be about 6 medium-sized pieces (they tasted pretty good)
Since I was still very hungry I ordered foccacia which turned out to be 3 pieces of very dry italian break that was burnt (to the point of being black on the sides and edges) with some bland mix of italian-like veggies
Overall, nice ambiance, but the food portions are too small and sometimes kinda bad
I wandered into this cafe very recently, and I found that it had a warm ambience about it
I would recommend the hot spiced apple cider especially, it is beyond belief; absolutely inspiring! The lighting, the space, and the color tones are all quite inviting
A must see!
I didn't dine here, but instead came here (12-20) for drinks and dessert after a disappointing experience at Cafe Milou a blocks away (you can read my review of that!) They have the friendliest staff here! It's a nice small cozy place, and they joked with me and my 2 friends
We kept ordering dessert, and they were so patient with us as we pressed our noses up to the glass and drooled
We decided on the tiramisu and warm apple crumb pie, which were both great
The rest looked good as well
Very pleasant experience
The Scene There's always a line out front at Da Silvano's--put it down to the owner, the celebrities and the sidewalk tables
Though service is occasionally spotty--especially in the summer when the sidewalk tables are overflowing--Silvano Marchetto generally keeps an eagle eye on his Tuscan establishment
The Food Appetizers like broccoli rabe with fennel sausage, mussels in garlic, oil and white wine or fresh, moist fried sardines are all outstanding, as is the long list of daily specials
Equally excellent main courses include a flavorsome pepper-crusted rare tuna and a boiled beef with cabbage that's the soul of comfort food
The roasted chicken breast is authentically robust
A pasta special with avocado and sea urchin is a rare disappointment--the flavors stubbornly refuse to complement each other--but many other reliable housemade pastas are available
The title above says it all
It is a fancy place, with good product, but it is tough to shell out such bucks for Italian, when you know you can get similar quality, with great ambience in little Italy
Also, the wine list does not have enough reasonable options
Went here on recommendations from friends who loved it
and glad we did
Sevice was friendly and efficient without being bothersome(always there when you needed them)
My wife had a delicious pasta dish and I had veal which was very tasty
It was a great people watching scene as well
Highly Recommended
The food was actually really good, we had the stuffed zucchini blossoms special as an appetizer
The verticle duck was quite good as well
The Bacala was much to be desired

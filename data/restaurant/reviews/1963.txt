take it from a cantonese girl who was bred on the best of chinese cuisine
its just not worth it
not even close
well, at least you get your moneys worth?
The last of the old time Cantonese Cuisines
I used to love to frequent a place called Lin's Garden on Bayard Street
It closed it's doors in 1990
This is about as close as you get to that feeling you got back in the 60's when after getting the munchies, was the kind of place you wanted to find at 3AM in the morning
Now 30 + years later, though the munchies are long forgotten and those 3AM Chinatown runs are too, it's fun to take that trip and relive it, even though it's now in a Minivan on a Sunday at 3 PM
You don't come here for decor, you come here for the food, which is exceptional
The prices are so low it's practically a crime, and it's unfortunately always crowded, but worth the wait
Note: If you're a tourist, have a stroller or a group larger than 4, do EVERYONE a favor and eat upstairs!
Even though it may be tiny, 17 Wo Hop (downstairs), is by far the best Chinese Food!! So many favorites
but Cantonese Chicken Chow Mein is amazing!!!
I went there after reading rave reviews from other people on citysearch and wasn't disappointed
Definitely the best Chinese place I've found in the city so far
The wonton soup was excellent and so was the chicken and brocolli
I suggest going with a big group cause the portions are huge and there's enough to go around to everyone with plenty to spare
Serving the tea in a glass is a little odd but that's about it
I still dream about the food at Wo's
I moved to the mid-west six years ago and miss the great food they have
Nothing nor no place can duplicate their Hot Sour soup, the Peking pork and a item not on the american menu called
Sizzling steak(chunks of tender steak with scallions and mushrooms with a brown sauce served in a hot pot
You have to ask for it, then explain it to the waiter who will give you a weird look but then write it down) If anyone from Wo - Hops is reading this, PLEASE, PLEASE, open a Wo's in Sioux Falls, South Dakota
I'm starving

the good food-cheap eats of chinatown (one of them)
you can't go with a bowl of wonton soup on a cold day and maybe some bbq pork over some white rice
this is a good place to grab a quick bite without having a heart attack when you get the check
Delicious meats for under five bucks, you can't beat that
They are cooked so perfectly, I always go there for take out
They also have great wonton noodles,congees, and rice dishes
Great cantonese fare!
Wing Wong has the best service in Chinatown
Waiters are friendly and quick to attend
No need for reservations
Food is deliciously tasty for a very cheap price
My boyfriend and I go there once a week
Its not Four Stars, but the food is great and service is fast
You can't find better cantonese noodles and bbq meats anywhere
i grew up in Chinatown, and as far as i remember
i always went to Wing Wong
They're quick and the food is always great
now they deliver, which makes it more conveniant
they were also featured in the newspaper, and the Foodnetwork also paid a visit
even my friends go everyday
This is the only Chinese restaurant we order from
It's always very good and gets there very quickly
They need to change the overall decor if they want to get a serious dinner crowd though
The Scene Franklin Station sits quietly apart from more garish Layla across the street
Couples gather at the diminutive tables over spicy bowls of curry chicken noodle soup, one of the single best interpretations of comfort food in Manhattan
It's difficult not to love the restaurant's quirks, such as the diagram-filled menus (the drawings look like the work of an eager-to-please fifth grader) and the unpredictable slide shows (during one visit, a series of verdant shots taken at French wine chateaux)
The Cuisine Though the curry chicken noodles alone make Franklin Station worth it, many of the daily specials and eclectic menu items also warrant a look
Watch for citric appetizers such as a salad of mango with shrimp and cilantro as well as more ambitious seafood preparations utilizing rainbow trout and Chilean sea bass
Wrap it all up with homemade chocolate chip cookies and an espresso
Any time I'm within 10 blocks of Franklin Station (and often when I'm nowhere even close!), I make a point of stopping in for a bowl of their chicken curry noodle soup
PERFECTION
Get a nice cold Sierra Nevada to go with it and you're sitting pretty
One of my favorites in NYC
Franklin Station is one of New York's best values
Delicious, well-prepared food, served in an airy cafe space where most entrees cost less than $15
The cafe is very close to the 1-9 Franklin Station subway stop, and has a pretty terrace for warm-weather dining
And the staff, reputed to be rude, actually greet regulars by name and with a smile
except for the generically bland decor, this spot is a first class restaurant, serving up authentic and absolutely delicious malaysian food
They also have great coffee and regular breakfast food, as well as tasty sandwiches
All this ensures that even if ur tryin to go with someone that doesnt like malaysian (or is afraid to try) they can have stuff that they def will eat
The afformentioned bland decor is more like super nice when compared to the dirty malaysian spots in chinatown too
Try the creamed spinach chicken and the mango squid salad, 2 of my favs
Yeah the service is curt, but its quick and accurate, which is all i care about
appetizers, and the selection was too small
Next time I go, I'll skip these courses
Nice selection of entres
The food was very good
Portion size was adequate on some entres, but skimpy on others
I had the Mango Curry Shrimp, and it was delicious!! And, the portion size was very good too
The Chicken Istimewa was also very good, with good portion size
I would NOT recommend the Papaya Boat or the Terenggaru Shrimp; not worth the price, especially if you're hungry
I went with 3 people, and they all enjoyed their meal
I had heard that the waiters here are curt
(They are
) They act as though they were working at one of NYC's most exclusive fine dining establishments
(They're not
) I kept my interactions with them to a minimum and focused my energy on the company and the food
The curry chicken noodles are flavorful without being too spicy; my friend enjoyed the mango curry shrimp
Making the experience unique and compensating for the rude waitstaff was a makeshift sideshow
I'm guessing that the washed out, thematically unrelated images would act as a perfect icebreaker if you were on a first date
The Scene Regulars revel in the hodgepodge feel of this neighborhood restaurant, where the decor and the cuisine are wildly eccentric
The bar room is almost tavern-like, while the rear multi-level tea room is more bohemian in its ambience
Service is well-meaning, but innattentive at times due to understaffing
The Food There's a Mediterranean bent to the menu--hummus, babaganoush and stuffed grape leaves are offered, as well as Moroccan chicken and spicy Merguez lamb sausage
Several of the side dishes -- especially the sauteed apples alongside the sausage, and the crispy coconut rice cake partnered with the pepper-crusted tuna -- outshine their main course counterparts, Though fresh and nicely prepared, most dishes could use a lighter hand with the salt shaker
And considering the restaurant's high tea program, desserts are surprisingly disappointing, especially the tough crusted nut tart and gluey tiramisu
I've been here a few times and always sat outside or at the bar
While I always enjoy the food I haven't always had the best service
Will I keep going back sure nice feel, relaxing drinks, good reasonable food
just not if I'm rushing to a movie
My friends and I were stuck in the city over the long Fourth of July weekend and we were looking for a place to have dinner and drinks
We were in Tribeca and found Yaffa's on Citysearch
I had always heard great things about this place over the years, so we decided to head there
Great decision! The food was outstanding and the place has a style and energy all it's own

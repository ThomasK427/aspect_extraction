The outer bourough couple next to us left their table between each cours for smoke breaks and the heavily made up woman bitched at the waiter for 10 minutes for forgetting to put a candle in her husband's desert
The piano player was pure cheese (he played Misty)
It was July and the fake fire place was blazing
The whole experience was horrifyingly awful
I felt like an old Hollywood star having drinks here
I spent hours talking with one of the regulars and listented to him tell me stories about this old haunt
The drinks were fine, but the bartender was very snobby
My future husband proposed to me here
He called them in advance and once he proposed, they were ready so they brought champaigne
they were very attentive, but on the other hand didnt bother us too much
We were seating by the fireplace and it was very romantic
Definately would recommend for a special occasion, but beware-a bit too expensive for small portions
Most romantic restaurant in NYC? Geesh I don't know abut that
Tremendous service, good but over priced food and a slightly gaudy, antiquey vibe does not make for such a mind blowingly romantic ambience from my and my girlfriend's point of view
If you go to this restauraunt I recommend getting the tasting menu, its a great way to sample many of the delicious items on the menu
Sure the place is somewhat romantic, but larger than one would expect and if you're not an aged playa, they'll seat you in the attic
The service adequately mimics upscale, but the executive chef fare is just that, an academic display of culinary knowledge
Huate brown suace if you will, liberally slathered around
Reserve early and grease whomever you have to to get seated down in the main room where you can hear the piano
60 bucks a head for bleacher seats and monotone entrees hinges on atmoshpere to exact a positive experience
This place is so romantic! Definitely one of the places in the city where many marriage proposals have happened! In a way I don't even want to go back because I don't want to spoil such a momentous memery
One of the most superb dinners I've had in New York
I recommend the taste menu
The service was excellent
Waiters weren't pretentious
The ambiance was very romantic and cozy which made the entire dinning experience more enjoyable
Perfect place to bring someone special
Highly recommend it
Yes, the ambiance is elegant but my idea of intimate isn't sitting on top of the couple dining next to me
The beef wellington is good, but doesn't warrant the price
Add in the fact that the place is tucked away in a seedy section of the village and you get a disappointing, overpriced, overrated experience
You can find much better for your money
We dined here on a Wednes
night and the restaurant was 1/2 full
The pianist was playing the theme song from Ghost
Other tunes to follow were Hill Street Blues and The Godfather
Equally painful, our waiter kept saying I'll leave you two alone now, (w/ a wink) which got increasingly annoying since we weren't getting engaged
Menu was either $65/person for the prix fixe or $75/person for the tasting menu
Monkfish and the steak were subpar
Dessert was a joke - chocolate souffle sank when the waiter cut into it! The staff was courteous but trying to push the romance card a bit far and VERY cheesy
In all, this was by far the cheesiest, unjustifiably expensive place we've been to after 3 yrs
in NYC
I wouldn't recommend the place unless you're looking to re-live a dining experience from your high school prom (yes, it's that bad, folks)
Great food and ambianice! I dined there when I was married and loved it so much that even the memory of eating there with my ex won't stop me from returning as often as possible
Here's to old flames and bright beacons!
The place is very romantic
Not flashy or gaudy, just simple elegance
It seems like every little detail has been seen to, From the lavish floral arrangements to great red wine glasses
The food? FORGETABOUTIT
The gnocchi my wife had on or last visit were the softest things I have ever ate
She loved the Free Range Chicken, and I always get the Beef Wellington
That stuff is like a religious experience
So flavorful and cooked to perfection
I will be making the 3 hour trip to NY on our 30th anniversary in June for dinner at my favorite restaurant ONE IF BY LAND TWO IF BY SEA
I had a very memorable night
The service, the elegance, the food
The intimate setting
It was a perfect evening and to top it I got engaged there
Truly a complete romantic package
Very nice ambience and delicious tasting menu
Good for special occassion like birthday, anniversary
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who's in the mood for a beautiful candle lit dinner! It gets better better every time I go! Truely one of the most romantic places I have ever eaten in
The chocolate soufflat is to die for!!
Yes! A very exciting, romantic, cozy, beautiful affair
We have committed ourselves to having our wedding ceremony and reception at One If By Land
We are so excited
We met with the event planner, Brian Sempel, and he is very pleasant
He seems to understand all our needs and desires for this very important day and will accomodate us in every which way he can
Again, we are excited to have our ceremony and reception at One If By Land
We celebrated my 27th birthday at the restaurant and we enjoyed every minute that evening in this beautiful, elegant restaurant which is most a very elegant, picturesque, romantic dining experience
We will update our review after our wedding day
Look for us!
Service was wonderful
Food was excellent with the perfect proportions
My reservation was for 6:30pm on Saturday evening and was never rushed at any point even though we were there for 3 hours
A perfect, romantic setup for an engagement proposal later in the evening
This incredible restaurant is one of those places that, well, ain't easy to find
Generally, I hear you need reservations weeks in advance, but I have had no problem just wandering in and getting a seat
The food is absolutely amazing and the service is impecable
While this Manhattan, candle-lit eatery is rather large for a West Village locale, each table will make you feel like you are alone
An excellent restaurant with excellent service
The staff is friendly and the food delicious
This would make for a good dining experience, but add the romantic atmosphere, flowers, candles, etc
you can't lose!
OIBL / TIBS has a beautiful room and ambiance BUT the food, service, and prices are below average despite the reputation
It does not live up to its reputation
Take your $100 per head and go anywhere else
Just fantastic! Reliable service, great food and the ambience is just right if you like the feel of an old rustic, colonial type place
Nothing but the best since it opened and still not too expensive
Maybe a few glithches but nothing to keep me going back again each month
The perfect romantic spot with a piano bar at night and winter fireplace
etta james sung it one if by land land lives it
you can't go wrong here
even if you tried
food atmosphere the place you want to enjoy food and the company you keep
It is refreshing to go to a place where they don't rush you out the door
The staff treated everyone with respect and gave us a fine presentation of food
After our engagemnt early in the day
It was important to the how do I Love thee part
This resturant did all that I expected more

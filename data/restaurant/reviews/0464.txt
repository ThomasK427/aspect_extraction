When in Florence, Italy, all I did was gelato-hopping
I love the thick texture and my kids love the zany flavors
Service is always pleasant
If you like strong coffee ice cream, this is the best in the US
Value isn't great though, you can get pints at Garden of Eden for less than the price of a small cone
When we returned from Italy, the first thing my friend talked about was incessant Gelato eating spree in every city we were in
Having sampled a few people's shares of gelato I can say Ciao Bella has it right
The gelato is firm and dense just like it is in Northern ITaly (as opposed to the really soft kind you get south which I think isn't as good)
As a chocolate fiend I prefer the Valrhona
Bliss
Malted Milk Ball Gelato - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful? Plus, you can grab a scoop and window shop in Nolita (the scoops will only cost you $4, but who knows what the shopping will)
You gotta try the pistachio ice cream - heaven on earth, even for people not enamored with pistachios
Root beer floats aren't that bad either
The Scene A steady crowd packs this popular sushi spot, which gets so loud that it's often impossible to tune out neighboring conversation
Don't be surprised when regulars start ordering items that don't appear on the menu, such as the spicy scallop rolls or the tofu-topped tuna sushi
Make like a NYC native and scout for recommendations, or else risk an expensive, modestly sized sushi special or the ho-hum menu items
The Food Ditch that edamame: the hijiki (cooked seaweed) and watercress salad offers a creamy, tangy, dangerously addictive surprise
Like any quality sushi establishment, Gari's raw fish is very fresh; highlights include the kanpachi (Japanese yellowtail; a firmer, slightly pickled-tasting version of the usual) and the buttery-tasting toro (fatty tuna)
For a colorful, not-too-sweet ending, sample the fried red bean ice cream in bright pink strawberry sauce
This is one of the best sushi places I've been to in NYC
It's absolutely wonderful! The sushi here is extremely creative, nothing that I've ever seen before
It's not the typical boring sushi that you find at most sushi places
The fish is not only extremely fresh, but the combination of ingredients in each piece is amazing
Master Gari really is the master of sushi
You can tell he puts a lot of thought in his work
The trick is that you have to sit at the sushi bar, order the omakase, and ask for Master Gari
I also thought the prices were extremely reasonable compared to other sushi restaurants of this caliber
Alone for 100 bucks, it is really overprice
The food is great, service is ok
It is not worth for that bucks
You have to increase the service a lot
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average
They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc
That's why you have to pay more for that
Hip dishes, unconventional, but not necessarily great flavors
Beware of the surprise dish, a very expensive sampling of sushi ($6 each piece), original fusion cuisine (i
e
: marinated snapper or monkfish liver tempura), but again, not necessarily the most appetizing
Used to be good with pleasant surprises but now it reminds me of the old steam engine
nostalgic memories but not really up for any fun trips
I was also so disappointed with this Sushi restaurant of good repute
Everything seemed overpriced for that quality of food, ambience and service
I've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but
The service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!
If you are solely into old-school sushi, you will not like it here
Every piece of sushi is reinterpreted with a twist- I love the way Gari complements each piece of fish with something you wouldn't imagine on a piece of sushi and have it come out so wonderfully! It's like a taste bomb of flavors
My husband and I had the omikase at the sushi bar
It was piece after piece of pleasant surprises
I think we sat in front of Gari himself but we were too embarrassed to ask
He would tell us the ingredients of each piece as he presented them to us in twos
It was a hit to our wallet but it was worth the experience
I'm dreaming now of when we can go back
There was one piece in particular with a tomato mixture on top that was so brilliant it haunts me today
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary
The sauces used are also not that exciting
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance
The NYC has available to it so many different vegetables, meats, and fishes; and Japanese cuisine has a number of unique foods and preparations all of which could have been used here with greater effect but all we get almost nothing of the sort
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged
Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull
My husband and I are 'regulars' here, and can't get enough
Their sushi quality is always consistant; however, we both prefer the east side location to the west side one
not only are the regular sushi they offer awesome and fresh, Gari's Special has the most creative combination of sushi and western ingredients and is always different
the waiter/waitress are very knowledgable on all the food offered
service is incredible
this place is the best place to get sushi in the whole city
five words to describe it: the best of the best
the food was great, and not in a ordinary sushi menu
Try Gari's choice and be prepared for a culinary Odyssey of the senses!
It's rare to find a place you like immediately, but this is definitely one of them
The normal menu offers many interesting choices (seared foie gras sushi being one)
However, finding a buddy/foodie who's been here before and ordering stuff not on the menu is truly where you get the holy grail of sushi (Good, Fresh, and worth it)
Omakase/Chef's choices are a MUST for the first-timers
Yes, it's a pricier prospect, but it really showcases this place's ability to wow you--and the real reason to come here from across the city
Gari gets top ratings for combining subtle sauces and textures to give the sushi Nobu-like flavors at Blue Ribbon/Yama prices
These guys got skillz
Sashimi and hand-roll lovers will also be in for a rare treat
Go between 5-6pm for better ambiance/service as they often get crowded
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic
Get the tuna of gari
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side
The seating is cramped
Decor is basic
Service is straight-forward
Sushi, particularly the omakase, is incredible
Gari knows what he is doing when combining flavors with his sushi and sashimi which I haven't experienced in any other Japanese restaurant
I wish the sake prices were a bit more accessible
No worries, it's really about the fish
Sushi of Gari has the freshest fish and the most creative and unnique tasting sushi in town
The seared toro sashimi or sushi are to die for
Definitely try the omakase set, not cheap, but worth every penny
my friends and coworkers always told me to go to Gari
and i finally did last night
my boyfriend and i were in love with every piece of sushi
if you go there, order Omakase, which is chef's choice sushi platter
on the menu, Omakase doesn't have a price, but it's about $50 per person
and you won't regret you order Omakase
it was very crowded on thurs night

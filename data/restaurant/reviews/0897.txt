Presented well, very sweet
However, by the end of the meal, we were just anxious to get it over with
This restaurant gives you satisfaction
Excellent dishes, polite friendly services, charming atmosphere and fantastic futuristic in 60's sense decor can guarantee you an unforgettable dinner
If you are looking for a New York In' place, you can't miss this one
Back to the future decor in a really cool room
I've been now for both lunch and dinner
Lunch was good people watching with some serious power celebs, but I prefered dinner to spend a little more time with my food
The flavors were clean fresh and focused
The chef really seems to respect the product
I loved the salmon ceviche and the foie gras was fantasic
For main courses there is a pork chop I wouldn't miss and my boyfriend loved his lobster
The desserts made us very very happy
BTW, the wine list has lots of hard to fine cult wines
The waiters seem to be on the ball and everyone was really nice
Its not cheap, but well worth it
I've been to Lever House for lunch and dinner and both were enjoyable meals
The room feels kind of like a cross between an old star trek movie and Barbarella (try to sit in the command deck at the back)
The service was quite good, one waiter was very funny and very helpful
The food is not amazing but it is pretty good and the wines the waiter helped pick out were excellent and reasonably priced
Overall a nice place place to go
How nice everyone is the moment I called for a reservation until I walked out the door
Everyone I encountered was so nice and so gracious, beautiful room and beautiful people, unbelievable food
My date had the duck app which was to die for and I loved the Halibut and the desserts were crazy good
I can't wait to go back to Lever House
I was nervous about going to Lever House because I thought it was going to be some stuffy pretentious power joint
What a pleasant surprise to find a fun, high-energy, beautiful restaurant
And of course it is great for people watching
The food was kind of food that makes you close your eyes and make happy noises
A melt-in-your-mouth white tuna tartare, a sweet and savory lobster tempura to start are sure fire, while I had a steak that was the best I've ever had
Don't forget to try the tropical fruit mojito (passion fruit??) and a great minty citron lemonade that was dangerously delicious
Absolutely first rate experience
If you would have asked me 6 months ago about Lever House I would tell you it is excellent and one of my favorite NYC restaurants now however I would say the exact opposite
When I went this past weekend the food was not prepared well, my bass was over cooked and my dates steak was tough
The service was horrible and overall it was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had! It is too bad because it used to be an excellent restaurant!
I'd heard many things in the past few months about this restaurant both pro and con, but my wife and I have consistently enjoyed the inventive food and cordial service at Lever House
Definitely worth the visit!
I've read mixed reviews, but I must say that this restaurant has served me a meal that they don't have to be ashamed of
Diver scallops were perfect, as well as the vitello tonnato
But don't expect a menu with original plates
It's mostly standard fare at high quality and very high prices
But price was not a problem, as witnessed by the capacity utilization (100%) of the tables
The right place for a good business lunch/dinner
After venturing to Lever House during the height of the buzz, I was pleasently surprised by the level of service and quality of the food
Now, after a return trip for dinner, the buzz has waned and the kitchen seems to have been outsourced to Applebees
My salad was virtually tasteless
However, I would have welcomed a second round of the salad after attempting to cut the sirloin
The Sizzler would have offered a far superior cut at a much lower price
This allegedly hip new restaurant gets an A- in service, and a C- in food quality
Sadly, the bread and garlic spread was the best part of the meal
The filet mignon was tepid, tasteless, and came with over-boiled vegetables swimming in a pool of meat juice and vegetable sweat
The sirloin was chewy at best, and the chef apparently added gristle at no extra charge! For this type of over-infused American fare, try a less expensive, less hyped locale further downtown
Considering how cold it's been in NYC this Winter, Lever House is not set up to deal with the cold
Freezing cold air was pumped into the dining room through the tunnel entrance causing most of the diners to get their coats from coat check
For god's sake - block that thing up so i can enjoy my average tasing dinner -- BTW: Killer Bar -- i'd go there for drinks (coat on) anytime
Yes, the building is historically important and the space is interesting
The food is okay but, not tops in the city
Noww that we've been fair on those points
Could the hostesses be more rude? There something to be learned from courteous service
The out of work actresses should adjust their attitude soon or they'll be booking tables on the phone for quite some time
The phone experience left me with a bitter taste
Enough of one that I put the time into writing this
Having dined in the Lever House, I know where all the money went--to the decor
Our service was exceptional, our food slightly above average
When a place is this beautiful, this hot, and this hip - I am usually skeptical
I am now a true believer
I was impressed: really nice, knowledgable staff, food that is well presented, thoughfully composed and delicious, and an interesting wine list
Lever House has it all
And no, evidentally you don't have to be a celebrity to be well treated
Was taken here recently for my birthday and although the place isnt quite romantic, its very cool and chic
Makes you feel like youre bound to see or be seen
The decor is minimal and modern - looks straight out of the future
The food was overall good but the apps blew away the entrees (carpaccio and duck recommended for apps - lamb for entree) - dessert was no joke either! Plate presentation was clean and well designed
Staff was friendly and knowledgable
We were even sat 15 mins earlier than our reservation
I would defintely return here :o)
Terrific Food, Service Marc Newson Decor
Hands down, the Best New Restaurant in 2003
a great, hip, good food place in midtown that will impress out of towners
very nice bartenders and hostess and good service, not too loud, alot of suits but very stylish - grown-up jetsons decor, a futuristic airport lounge feeling - loved it
As jaded NY diners, we are happy to express our delight at Lever House
Everything was superb, even after my menu caught on fire
A genuine midtown destination
I don't care about super-hip ambience, nor am I impressed to be dining in a room full of celebrities, (both of which apply to my eperience at Lever House)
What was amazing: incredible and unusual wines (impressive list), not-to-be-believed appetizers (I sampled several), perfect lamp chops, and hugely decadent desserts
And, the service was impressive, considering I was at the only non-celeb table in the room
In general, this was one of my better NYC dining experiences
In Short The top-grade La Marzocca espresso machine here is a strong hint to those in the know that Joe is focused on the quality of its coffee
The small space offers limited room to linger, but nonetheless a loyal following has sprung up around the shop
In addition to the array of coffees and teas, a selection of pastries--muffins, coffee cakes--are offered
This place has very good coffee, bagels and cakes
Unfortunately the service is terrible especially on weekends
Longs lines are one thing and could be bearable if the staff were more hospitable, got the order right occasionally and didn't spend most of their time chatting with their buddies in front or behind of the counter
The staff aren't very professional e
g
they tend to serve their friends and let them cut in line, further contributing to long waits for paying customers
Despite the good coffee after so many maddening visits we've sworn to never go back
You know it's hard to find a non-Starbucks cafe these days
Luckily, there's Joe's
I found it on Citysearch and couldn't be happier

Long wait but you know its worth it because the place is always packed
they take reservations and call your cell when they are ready
good service, fun place
you have to take off your shoes but atmosphere is great
What a totally unique experience this place is
You sit down in this benches hollowed out of the floor, sunken, and upon entry you remove your shoes and wear neat slippers
So you're in a different mood immediately
And I guess things changed since a review below from March, as they actually required reservations when I called recently just for a group of 4, tho they reassured me Mondays aren't overly busy
This is the perfect place to go to with a group
It's a great social environment that's reasonably priced and caters to larger parties
The fact that you can grill your own meat is also very appealing, as many people can be very picky with how their food is cooked
Best of all, the prices are great
So far I've taken 2 people here for their birthday dinners and they've each enjoyed it tremendously
My 2 biggest problems with Yakiniku West are the Loooooong waits on Thurs-Fri-Sat nights and that they don't take reservations, even for large parties
But that's not enough to keep me away
In fact, I'm going there tonight
This place is getting worse and worse
The service, (the waitstaff and lady manager) is so bad that I no longer visit here
The quality of the beef is very dissapointing too
It's not even worth to pay $10
If you are looking for a value BBQ, go to YAKINIKU JUJU where serves ALL YOU CAN EAT for $20
Better food and better service
I enjoy Yakiniku West for two reasons: It offers traditional Japanese seating and settings; and the food is very reasonably priced
Yakiniku West is a rare Japanese restaurant for not being about sushi (and I hate ALL seafood)
Although I wouldn't recommend getting the restaurant's cheapest dinner special: It's obvious the meat used for the under $10 meal isn't the same quality as that used when you buy the dinner special that's just an extra $2 more
But each time I've gone, I've been very happy with the service, with the meals, and the fact that they allow you to take your time to eat and enjoy your friends (several of whom I've taken; only two didn't like it)
It's a great place when you like different types of food but don't have the budget to afford the Japanese restaurant in the Waldorf-Astoria
Yakiniku West should be ashamed of itself
They have not only sacrificed the quality of their product but have offended good customers with an inept manager
They have offered dinner special for some time and I have found very reasonable
Last wk, we were shocked when the waiter brought the beef
We noticed the difference immediately-there was no beef but ALL FAT
We attempted to grill the beef which was absolutely inedible
We called the manager, but we were informed that they changed the quality of the beef because they wanted to save $
She offered no apology and no consideration to upgrade the meal
She walked away disappeared
I can't express the anger indignation we felt at her behavior and strongly suggest that YAKINIKU WEST be avoided
Shame on them for serving garbage
Shame on manager for acknowledging she was serving crap and doing nothing about it
This place has been a favorite among my circle of friends for years -- for $12, you can get a full meal with soup, salad, a large plate of meat and ice cream
With its expansive menu, you can also get sushi and any number of appetizers (including takoyaki -- the octopus balls that are popular in the little place down the street); and no other place is better to sit back with friends over beer and a good meal
The place is spacious and pleasantly spare in decor
Three drawbacks: a notoriously crusty waitstaff, difficulty getting a table because it is often so busy and because of the way the tables are laid out, difficulty seating groups over six (although, the converse is that groups of four to six are easier to seat here than most other places)
I have visited this restaurant several times over the last 2 years and have ahd a great experience everytime
Especially, it 's a great place to take out-of-town guests
You must remove your shoes to enter the restaurant
The sirlion is the best
In Short Just around the corner from 6th Street's India Row, this elegant eatery--with orange walls, soft lighting and high-backed banquettes capable of accommodating large parties--exudes a formal mood
Jacketed servers deliver a colorful array of vegetarian dishes, as well as classic staples, such as tandoori chicken, lamb biryani and goat cooked in yogurt and almonds
The vindaloo is one of the city's spiciest
i really like mitali east and my friend highly recommended this sister restaurant
i came here with two other people for sunday night dinner
the dcor is nice and the overall ambience was quite romantic
the three of us decided to split the beef vindaloo (($11), murgha tikka muslam (chicken tikka masala, $13), and the mushroom shaag (mushroom with spinach, $9), along with poori, stuffed naan, and plenty of basmati rice
the vindaloo was very spicy but it was so flavourful that i just kept eating
the masala was milder, with juicy chunks of tender white meat in a creamy sauce
the mushroom shaag felt slightly oilier but was nicely spiced
everything went well with the sides of carbs
theres a lot of variety on the menu and prices are reasonable
bill came to ~$55 (including tip) and we were extremely full
service was non-obtrusive but efficient
My wife and I go out to Indian on regular basis, but at one point I wanted to go somewhere romantic
This place was perfect
The candle lit tables were as if you were in a restaurant about to drop $100 per person
The service was great
The food was nice, not too spicy and very flavorful
Now you can go and eat a romantic Indian dinner
I've been going here for years and all I can say is the food is the BEST! I still have yet to find a place that serves true Indian cuisine minus the grease
Great spot for vegetarians! The place is always quiet and romantic
I'm a little apprehensive about the comments on the service - b/c every time I've been there the service has been up to par
Ok
so everything was bad when i went
the food was cold
really bad service took half an hour just to get a drink
20 mins to get me a plate
the waiters were talking amongst each other rather then working
so ya
i dont reccomened
I've been going to Haveli for years and they have had consistently good Indian food
The menu has a nice variety of options: vegetarian, seafood, meats, north and south indian food
I've always had very tasty, filling meals here
The service can definitely leave a bit to be desired, but the food is much better than its 6th st counterparts, and a little more expensive (but still very reasonable)
If you like your food spicy you should definitely let them know, their standard is relatively mild (for indian food)
Haveli and Mitali are real Indian food, not the mock-Indian greasy Bangladeshi crap which, in general, makes up 90% of the 6th street Little Bangladesh area
Excellent food, but quite definitely overpriced
I spent a year learning to cook Indian because I loved the Mitali/Haveli dishes so much, but got tired of paying $6 for a 50 cent dal, hehe
You get what you pay for
Haveli was a good neighborhood alternative to the embarrassing Indian restaurants that surround it; if you're looking for quality Indian food, best not to go to those
The food at Haveli, however, was quite good, if a little more expensive than necessary
It was the service, however, that ruined the dining experience: they simply don't have enough servers in the dining room to do anything efficiently
Ordering takes forever; food delivery takes forever; getting the check takes forever, etc
etc
With a few extra waiters and some consideration, it could be a pretty good restaurant
We were promptly seated, we were given explanation of the different foods and spices by our waiter
He was extremely friendly
Though, there was a little confusion w/the serving of the food, they quickly made up for it w/a complimentary Mango Ice Cream Dessert
It was excellent!
This is definitely better than Balucci's, its neighbor
The food was delicious and the chicken in the chicken tikka masala tasted like it was cooked in a real tandoori oven(a rare find)
The nan was a little too greasy, but the rice was good

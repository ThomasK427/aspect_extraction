and the steak can be questionable
But everything else on the menu is great!! The service is great, typical Irish charm
Don't be overwhelmed by the crowd in the front of the restaurant, there is a huge back section with a 2nd bar that always has room for more
We found Matts grill a few blocks from our midtown hotel
Thank God!!! my wife and I were visitng from Boston and the SOX were playing the yankees
We watched two games at Matts
The food was great ,the bar was fun ,the service was freindly and for New York the price right
If Matts was in Boston it would be my place
By the way it seems to be a yankees bar
I can not believe I am saying this but all the people(read yankee fans) were very nice and fun even though we were cheering for the SOX
The bottled beer that they serve here has to rank amongst the coldest that I've ever been serve at a bar in NYC
Food is good and prices are semi-reasonable
It's not a big place with a long bar and a few side tables
They have 2 flat screens (at each end of the bar) to watch games
Service is friendly, but not very attentive
Nice place to get something to eat and relax
Matt's Grill has turned into our local Friday lunch destination being i work in West Midtown
We like it, has a comfy environment though is slightly overpriced
Word on the street is the fries are amazing (which i have never had), the shrimp looked fantastic while the burgers and chicken pot pie were average
I had both
We were all very dissapointed with the service which was extremely slow
One of my co-workers almost chewed her arm off waiting
Its a great place for the neighborhood and on friday i enjoy hearing my coworker say It's Friday Kiiiiiid!! Matt's Grill!!!
We came upon Matt's grill after a Sunday matinee at the theatre
We were out-of-town tourists (party of six including 2 children aged 14 and 11) and found Matt's Grill just walking by
The ambiance was wonderful, service was great and the menu had something on it for everyone
The food was delicious! Perhaps during a busy period it wouldn't be that suitable for children, but a Sunday afternoon was delightful, service was great and prices were very reasonable
This place was cozy and the food was really good
Service was great
They keep you well stocked on drink!
Look no further for the best spot in Midtown
The atmosphere is fun and the service is spectacular
You will find many great items on their menu and will not go home disappointed
If you are looking for a few steps above a normal pub Matts Grill is for you
Try the Steak Sandwich and make sure to order the Chicken Fingers and Garlic Fries
Enjoy, this is one of our favorite places for a bite to eat as well as relax for some drinks
If your looking for a great place to grab a meal and a beer in Midtown West, look no further
Matt's Grill offers amazing food at slightly higher than pub prices
The fries are always perfect and the entrees hit the mark
Don't miss Matt's Angus Burger and the Cajun Meatloaf with mash potatoes
Every time I have eaten there, the service has been friendly and fast
The bar is well stocked with good beers on tap
The crowd is of mixed ages and gender
There is usually a game on the the TV's, and the music is never that loud
All in all, a quality place to grab some snacks with a friend
After waiting an extremely long time (the place was almost empty!), when the food was delivered, one of our party received the wrong dish
When brought to the waiter's attention, he named what the dish was, and my friend told him what she had actually ordered
Looking perplexed, the waiter went abd brought his manager to the table
Upon repeating to the manager that she had received the wrong dish, the manager asserted that she was wrong, and had ordered what she received, and walked away! I have never seen such cold treatment from an allegedly good restaurant guest in my life
My husband and I had a wonderful pre-theatre dinner at Ciro Trattoria last night
We were seated at a table at the window- had wonderful service, and a delicious meal for a great price
The potato-crusted salmon, and spinach panzanella salad were delicious We're looking forward to returning!
Very good Italian food, reasonable prices, good service
Two things that make this place a return visit: ALL pastas are cooked al dente + great bread basket (too bad about the cafeteria style foil wrapped butter pats)
My friends and I were visiting NYC for my 40th birthday and just happened upon Ciro Trattoria
The precious bartender took our photo, and the oh so nice waiter seated us right by the window
The food was great, and the ambience was soothing after a long day in an airplane
What a great introduction to the nice people in the theater district
Druids is in a somewhat scary neighborhood in the heart of Hell Kitchen
It is much cooler than the neighborhood with a fun outdoor patio and friendly staff most with Irish accents that are too charming for words
Outside there are nice but weird things on the wall encouraging brilliance and flamboyance
(Drink Club is a social group of NYC drinkers
We meet in a different bar every week
)
I made a brunch reservation for the 12 in the garden two weeks in advance
Not only did they open the place AFTER brunch was to have started, they did not accommodate us, and gave no apologies or explanation for their refusal to seat us
And they were rude about it, too!
Everything you look for in a neighborhood restaurant
solid food, comfortable atmosphere and friendly service
It doesn't look like much from the street, but between the warm, familiar decor and sunny back garden we always leave happy!
What else can I say? For the price they're OK
My go-to Japanese delivery for when I don't want to leave my desk at lunchtime
This is, hands down, the best Mexican I have had yet in NYC (and I have looked)! My wife and I are Dallas transplants and this place is the closest we have come to real Tex-Mex
Great chips and salsa (for free!)
The burritos and enchiladas are excellent and the margaritas can't be beat
It can be fairly noisey and the ambiance is not the best, but good Mexican restaurants are rarely known for the quality of the surroundings
Go to this place for great food
As for the negative reviews, I would never order fish let alone any type of seafood at a Mexican place
Order the the burritos, tacos or enchiladas and enjoy something truly delicious
Leave the snapper for a seafood restaurant!
The taco salad is especially nice for lunch
Light and filling
The decor is lovely
Not overdone at all
The small bar is a nice, cozy spot for Saturday night
Not hopping, not dead
Everyone I've been with has enjoyed the meal for taste and value
so the service is far from the greatest you will encounter, but the amazing margaritas and good food overshadow it
everytime my friends and i walk out of there, we bitch about the service but always go back because the food is so good and the place is so much fun
good shots at the bar as well
This was my first and last time ever going to this place
The service was ok
But the food was horrible
I didn't like my meal at all and asked for something else and they said no
Never had I experience this at a resturant before
The manager was rude and very stand offish
The customer does not come first at this place
Eat at your own risk
I was there 6/23 based on the previous ratings
I had Red Snapper that was so salty I couldn't eat it (and I like salty food)

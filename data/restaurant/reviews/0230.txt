The back room seats up to 70 and its so romantic with exposed brick and candles everywhere
The owner and staff went out of their way to make everything perfect
They even had arranged a car to take us home at the end of the evening!
I recently held my wedding and reception at Rialto
Our guests kept compimenting (and STILL are!) the excellent food, the romantic atmosphere, the gorgeous flowers, the wait staff, everything
More than anything I wanted our guests to simply have fun and enjoy a good meal, and Sam and his staff at Rialto did exactly that for us
It's so rare to see such enthusiasm these days
Sam truly loves what he does
Dine here anytime for a good meal in a romantic spot in a cute neighborhood, but especially if you need to throw a private party go here, because it's such a fantastic value
I've been coming to Rialto for 8 years now and have never had a less than perfect experience
The rare combination of solid service, great food and right-at-home atmosphere is a welcome change from much of the NYC dining scene
I've had hundreds of dinners at Rialto, done corporate events, and recently Sam did our entire wedding--IN MEXICO
Think Jean-George would do that for you? Think again
My wife and myself recently held our wedding dinner at Rialto for our a group of twelve family members
Sam and the staff at Rialto were so accomodating and gave us a dinner event we will always remember
Our table was in the garden room, which has a very rustic feel and has a very cozy and romatic atmosphere
The food was incredible from the appetizers to the dessert
Our guest had different dishes and raved about each one
The staff were very attentive and Mario was a great bartender-ask him to mix you something hot
I personally had the Tuna and Wasabi mashed potatoes which were delicious
Our guest keep asking us how we found such a good place
Sam was extremely helpful and patient
We can't wait to go back
We stumbled upon Rialto while searching for somewhere to eat last Sunday night
It was fairly quiet with few diners
Inside was dark with Large round leather perimeter banquettes and center tables
My main fish dish with mashed potatos was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection, my friend had the turkey burger which he thought okay
Service was good
This place has an unusual old house feel about it
Name isn't all that appealing but the food is worth it
I've dined and attended a few parties at Rialto several times
And when the time came for our wedding brunch for 40 people, Rialto was it
The premise is classy but non-pretentious, courtyard is cozy, rustic and nicely designed with exposed brick, summer foliage, with a nice tent over it
Our event was fantastic, the food was customized deliciously just for us, even the fruit salad starters were lovely
Sam had arranged special flowers for each table and decorated the whole place in such beautiful ambiance
The staff were so attentive
Even the house champagne was just perfect for toasts
SAM is the best--personal, patient, creative, and just the sweetest person you'll meet
I highly recommend Rialto as the place for a romantic moment for two, or a large party for any celebration! Where else will you find a quaint little place on a quiet, hip, block in lower manhattan?!
My fiancee and I have never been disapointed by the Rialto
It is a charming place
We 've been there 5 or 6 times in the last 2 years, and we never regret it! Sam and his staff are very accomodating and welcoming
The food isn't the most complex but it is tasty
The portions are not small, normally quantity doesn't go with quality, but we never been dispointed by the quality of the food
I highly recommend this unknown NOLITA
Sam was very accommodating in meeting our wishes for our son's wedding reception in the garden room
We had 60 guests and everyone raved about the service, food and comfortable atmosphere
Sam and his crew do a first-rate job!
I recently hosted a surprise party for 25 people at Rialto and it was above and beyond what I expected - everything was perfect
Sam was incredible to work with and made everything seamless and perfectly coordinated
He gave us the entire bar area to hang out in before dinner and then sat us at 1 big table in the back room
He took care of everything, including coordinating the delivery of my ballons and cake! Everyone was impressed with the food, service and ambiance and was asking how I found such a perfect location for the party
I would definitely recommend Rialto for a large party or a romantic spot for a date
I planned a birthday dinner for 7 and we were accommodated very nicely
Sam even set up a round table just for our group
The water refills were a little slow, but they were very busy
Overall a great night - and would highly recommend it for groups
A great NOLITA eatery on Elizabeth
Good Dinner, and Lunch, superb Brunch
Amazing side dishes, and pretty good drinks
Rialto is one of those places you stumble upon and boy, are you glad you did
Without any doubt order the Grilled Corn on the cob, w/ White cheese and spices
Delicious
Words can not describe our perfect night at Rialto
We had a big group for dinner to celebrate my graduation
The staff was so accomidating to our party, everyone was pleased, including my parents
The host was so gracious and had the table set beautifully in the garden
I still can not get over how yummy the calamari and bruschetta was, which was brought out before we even started our meal
The drinks were tasty, the food was delicious, the staff was unpretentious, and the price was right
Rialto is our new hang out for the summer
A MUST!!!!
Rialto always makes you feel welcome, the staff are wonderful and there is a great atmosphere when its full aswell as when its quiet
The food is sensational, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu
But what makes it the best is the cocktail menu - there is something for everyone
From there own twist on a cosmo to a french martini or havana cocktail - all are great
And if you are lucky brent or damien will mix you up something special of their own !!!
I booked a table for 22, based on the reviews from other large parties for Rialto, and was not disappointed
Sam was a delight to work with, and made me feel that he was more excited about my party than I was! Service was excellent, and although the food took a while to appear the wait staff handled the situation with grace, and everyone went home happy
The garden space must be charming in warmer weather, but still worked well covered over
Highly recommended
Top 10 best places in nyc
The garden is romantic and good for groups
The tuna is amazing
Sam is one of the nicest people in nyc
There is something about the lighting, the food, the music, etc that fuses together creating an enchanting and transporting experience
I wish there were more places like this one!
There's only one reason to come to this restaurant; the atmosphere
I highly reccommend sitting in the back room
The food here is decent, but you're paying for the atmosphere
This is a great place for large groups
Everyone was very happy with the food
Most of the dishes were reasonably priced, though the drinks were a little on the expensive side
It is definitely a good value for your money
My only complaint was that the place can get a bit noisy
Staff was very friendly too
Went here this weekend with a group of 13 and it was fabulous
Delicous food- calamari was especially fantastic, everyone loved their entrees, and dessert was great too
We sat out back and had great service, were never rushed
Great foods at very fair prices
Will definitely be back!

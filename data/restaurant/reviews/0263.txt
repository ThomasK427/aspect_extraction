My friend asked for a steak medium well, and it came rare
It was then reheated and tasted terrible
I actually received something that I did not order then the waiter claimed it was what I ordered
I'm sorry though I've never been to Italy, I know what Gnocci looks like
and it doesn't look like pasta with white cream sauce
This place will not survive long
The waiter with a dirty towel on his right shoulder might have to find another profession
As tourists roaming the east village on a slow weeknight, a coulple of locals recommended Gnocco's
I can understand some of the bad reviews
We were the only ones in the place
The cheese plate was overpriced, it had more pears than cheese
The main course was awesome though
It had a real homemade feel with mom in the kitchen, without professional experienced servers
This could all equal a bad experience if it was busy
Otherwise it was perfect for these tired Los Angeles tourists
A restaurant thats friendly and unpretentious, casual but nice enough to make dinner feel a little special
Great food and friendly, attentive service
We had a table for four in the lovely garden on a busy Friday night
Our guests were impressed with the food, as were we
The food was beautifully presented and tasting DELICIOUS
Great place - definitely recommend it
I recently dined here with 10 family members
We were squashed into a table in the back and the service was terrible! We specifically requested a high chair but when we got there they said they didn't have one
So I had to have my wiggly 2 yr old on my lap the whole ime! Two pizzas arrived about 10 minutes before the rest of our meals
Two entrees were WRONG and to correct it would have taken 20 minutes according to the waiter
so two people had to settle for something they did not want
Three desserts were not served at all
When brought to the wait staff's attention, two were served and the other NEVER arrived! The waiter disappeared after our meals were served
He lost out on what would have been a very generous tip
The service was bad enough that we'll never go back!
Simply the best, original italian restaurant in the East Village
pizza is amazing in roman style, prepared by truly roman born chef
I go there often because I feel like at home, in one of those little pizzerie in Trastevere, the heart of Rome
Ragazzi di Gnocco siete grandi, thanks for existing
I am Italian 100% and I have to tell you this place is really bad
after we seat the waiter asked for drinks and 3 of our choices of wine were not available
they had also finished mozzarella and the lasagna
so it took us 30 min to order
I was there with 4 friends and while 2 pizzas arrived proptely the rest took forever
Pizzas were really good just like in Italy but food suckd
25$filet migno was old and toped with an awful balsamic souce the reginette were made with a souce of terrible gorgonzola
we were charger 9$ for a side of prosciutto that was the worst I have ever had and we send the calamari back because they were stinky
service was alright however not relaxed because always apologizing for kitched mistakes
Just came back from taking an out of town guest and was completely disappointed
The food was bland and overly salted
Service, if there was any, ignored us
and the tables were dirty in the garden as they call it
Skp this restaurant for a better experience elsewhere!
I had to write a review (my 1st I use this site extensively) after reading the previous reviews
Went here a few weeks ago with an Italian friend who brought me because the food reminds her of grandmother's
Without a reservation and it was crowded, we were seated in less than 15 minutes
Our server was attentive, and our food was everything that it was supposed to be
I have recommended this restaurant to several friends already and plan to go back myself
Yes, it was noisy, but we got there around 9 and by the time we left, it had quieted down
However, we never lacked for service
I have to recommend this little restaurant on East 10th
The ambience inside makes it a perfect place for a first date
I arrived there at around 9:00pm on a thursday night with a couple of friends and we were promptly seated
We started ordering wine and, since we don't know much about it, we decided to let the waiter choose for us; we were pleased with his recommendation
The food was great as well (my favorite dishes: ravioli, antipasto di mare and especially tagliata)
I'll definitely go back
Hopefully with a date!
I recently dined here with 5 friends
While we had a nice table in the back, the service here was terrible! The food was okay, but I am sure it would have been better had it not been cold when we actually ate it
One friend's pizza arrived about 15 minutes before the rest of our meals (the remainder of our entrees did not even arrive at the same time), and our waiter half-heartedly apologized for the delay while rolling his eyes
And the place was not even busy! To top it off, we had to ask for our check four times, and the wait staff acted annoyed that we wanted to pay and leave (better than just leaving)
While this place could be good if theyd lose the attitude and get the timing worked out, they angered me enough that I'll never go back!
GREAT PIZZA! Even if I was there to eat some pasta, I had to try it, it smelled too good
If you go, try Tartufata
Attentive staff, with prompt service at all time
Don't miss the Gnocco with prosciutto!!
Just had the best Eggplant Parm of my life! Unbelieveabley delicious!  Hey, the serivice is easy going
don't go if you are in a rush or are a high-maintainance person
But if you can chill and enjoy your time there, then this is the place for you!  The Tartuforo (sp?) pizza is just to die for!  Go, relax, enjoy
Very dissapointing, good service but terrible food, basic mistakes, unseasoned food, falvourless beef, warm wine glasses, unfresh fish
A Barola sauce which was terrible, I'm not sure how they made a suace taste so simple and one noted
Very dissapointed and all for 100 dollars for 2 people
Waited ages for our main courses
They brought-out one of our meals 20 minutes before the others arrived
We had to ask them to take it back to keep it warm
I had to ask for my drink twice and it never arrived
Even water was tough to get
In general, the food took too long to be served after ordering
The service was polite, but there was just not enough of it
This all being said, once the food arrived, it was very good
This place is great whether on a date or with a group
They don't rush you out, and the food is affordable and good
Try to get a seat in the garden if it is nice out
The gravina wine is a good option and their new pizza selections are fabulous
Gnocco is hands down my favorite restaurant in NYC!
Being an Italian living in NY, I sincerely miss the friendly trattoria food that you find everywhere in Italy
the mid-price restaurant where to take friends and family! Well, gnocco is all that and more, fantastic affordable food, friendly staff, and a easy atmosphere!
I have lived E
Village for over 2years and eat in the neighborhood restuarants frequently
In all that time I have never been more disappointed
In fact I have never written a bad restaurant review
The food here was awful
My entre was so salty I could not even eat it and my guest was disgusted by a bad piece of fish
The tomatoes and mozzarella app
was awful

the meat was dark hard and the cheese was watery
Dinner was brought out before we were done with the appetizer
that was the last we saw of the waiter for almost 40 minutes
We were charged for a double shot of sherry
which we did not get; the owner was miserable to us about it until we left (pointing to us and giving us dirty looks)
This was, by far, the WORST experience I've had a NYC restaurant
I went with 6 friends and the wait staff was very accomodating and friendly (especially since we were late for our reservation but I called them to let them know we were on our way), the food was DELICIOUS (and this is coming from an Italian-American!) -- enough on the plate to be filling without feeling overstuffed and a great value for the money
With 2 appetizers, a few glasses of wine (iced tea for the rest of us) and 7 entrees, the dinner was only $180-something! All 7 of us truly enjoyed our meal
I recommend LE TRE VENEZIE!
We came here an expected it to be busy as it was still theatre time, the place was quite empty with little atmosphere
The waiters were average and not very attentive, the food was not cooked to order or undercooked and the wine was foul - at least the (free) bread was good - not good value for money
Stumbled in here after theatre
The veal parmagiana was excellent (and huge portion)
Everything else was so so
Service was worse than average
Great meal, was friendly, prices good, service better, all in all excellent!
Decor is lacking but food certainly isn't
Good range of choices
Waiters are v friendly will explain the food to non Brazilians
Caiprihinas are lovely v strong
A nice list of foods and strong caiprihinas make for a pleasant dinner
The dessert cart gets your mouth watering
Stop by if you need a change of pace from the regular stuff
Great Place, Great food! Superb drinks courtesy of Leo! Thanks Alfredo and Carlos for this place! A heaven for people who work in the area
Bife Acebolado is my favorite dish
If you want good steak at a great price (Brazilain Style) this is the place to go
To those who doesn't experiment with foods from foreign countries - do not go in there
To those who who knows what real food means - you are welcomed! Brasil is beautiful country with happy people and awesome food
You can find it on W 46 street in Manhattan
I live in Seattle and we have only one Brasilian restaurant
Lucky New Yorkers have a lot
Ipanema is one of the best
We felt like the restaurant was working hardest on getting us out instead of making us food
Ironically, there were 6 other tables behind us in eating, so the rush made no sense
The food was very rich, and ingenuitous (one dish served in a hollowed coconut), but it sat heavy in the stomach
The waiter was nice, but the busboys were a pain
Don't expect your water glass refilled
This Brazilian restaurant has no Brazilian beer-- Portugese is closest
There's GOT to be a better place that isn't Plataforma-style
I am brazilian and I love the food here! There vatapa and moqueca are amazing! the service was extremely friendly-and i lovee that they were brazilian so I could speak portuguese with them
The only thing was their farofa was mediocre, but then again I've never had farofa in a restaurant I was a fan of, my mom's is too good! Overally I highly recommend this restaurant!
I lived in Brazil for 2 years and enjoyed having the experience of going to Ipanema for dinner
I could not believe how much food they brought out to the table! I could not eat it all there was so much! The servers were great - plus it gave me a chance to catch up on my Portuguese
Great place!
I went to this restaurant for lunch with a few friends
The service was slow, and the food was mediocre for the price is about $15 and up for an entree
None of us were particularly exicited about our meal, I had the roasted chicken dish, and they had the steak
I think you can find a better restaurant for the same price range
This was a great brazilian restaurant
The food was great and so were the drinks
The service was good
I definately recommend this restaurant
This was my first experience with Brazilian and for the most part I liked it
Our servers were really friendly and chatted it up with us all evening
The atmosphere was very relaxed, almost like you were a guest in their home
Although this restaurant is small, it accommodated us and we were a large group
The food was good and everyone seemed pleased with their selection
We were all fans of the fried sausage
Yum, yum!
Ipanema feels defitently like you are in Brasil--with traditional Brasilian food and charm
George is an amazing waiter like a father
The owner is equally nice
The cater to your every whim and treat you like family
Ipanema is a great place; my boyfriend, who is brazilian, had certainly appreciated my choice of the restaurant to dine in, for he even sent me flowers at work the morning after the dinner! He definitely loved the food :)
Shrimps in coconut milk are delicious, though if you're not the real brazilian you probably will be full with less than a half of the dish
We will surely go back to Ipanema: me-for more caipirinhas, my boyfriend-for a friendly chat with waiters, in portugeese!
I found it on Citysearch
com and now can't say enough
Ipanema is a 10! The food is not only delicious but they give you SO much! You've got to have the Porteagues sausage
Their Pahela is so packed with seafood that no one fought to have some lobster
The CAIPIRINHAs are great, the food delicious, and the service friendly and efficient
Not being to familiar with the area I found it a little hard to find but it was a true find
I had some shrimp in coconut milk that was served in a hollowed out coconut, which was very tasty
My wife and I had a few too many Caipirinhas which made the walk to Madison Square Garden a challenge
I found out about this restaurant in July,2002 and have gone back 4 times since
Super Delicious food, love the coconut shrimp and the lamb chops, very friendly service
A perfect dining place for friends and family
JUST LOVE IT!!!!!!!
The Scene This narrow, handsomely decorated space in the core of the Theater District is host to an array of out-of-towners and business diners, drawn by the convenience of the site
Service can be disorganized
The Food Though the restaurant promises "creative Pacific Rim cuisine," dishes are more likely to be familiar Japanese dishes
The centerpiece of the menu is a range of sushi and sashimi "sets": standard pieces and rolls that are adequately fresh and reliable
Also available are a host of hot entrees: grilled steak, teriyaki chicken and broiled fish--snapper or striped bass--in a sweet brothy sauce
Some offerings exhibit the occasional nod toward Hawaii, such as the taro chip that the bland tuna and salmon tartares are served on
Caramel profiteroles make for a surprisingly satisfying dessert
Given that I work in the area and often order food at work, this is a place I will call often
The food is always delicious and the sushi has never been anything but fresh
The spider roll crispy tuna rolls are fantastic, the sashimi is very very fresh
Excellent value for what you get and a terrific place for a pre theatre dining
Definitely a reasonably priced stop in the Theatre District
Cute hostess and fast service
The fixed price boxes are plentiful and tasty
Teriaki chicken is excellent as well
It's small but cozy
Definitely do more business in take-out but you won't be disappointed if you stop in
Highly recommended
Overall, the food is good for its price
Good sushi and a good menu selection
Very consistent and solid quality
I am a little disappointed that it doesn't have a lunch menu as I find the overall menu a little pricey for lunch around that neighborhood

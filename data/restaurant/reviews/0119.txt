Unfortunately, it was terrible
I had linguine with clams which was way too salty and was undercooked
My father had zuppa del pesce which had such a strong fish smell that I almost couldn't eat my dinner
The lobster ravioli was bland and uniteresting
The only thing that was good was the cod
I can't believe Mario Batali even associates himself with this restaurant
The only explanation for its continued existence is that the clientele is mostly tourists because it is in the theatre district and and therefore they don't need repeat business
On a plus note - the service was great
After so many great reviews here, my bf and I went to Esca to celebrate my birthday last nite
The ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic
However, being foodies, we were utterly disappointed with the food
It is bland and nothing extrodinary
One of our apps came extremely overcooked and rubbery and we were asked if we wanted to switch apps
When the bill came, both appetizers were charged even though we had one bite of the first and it should not have served competely overcooked
They did take it off when we asked them to
I recommend the black roasted codfish, it was the best dish of the evening
Would not return for the amount we paid
No room at the bar and nowhere to stand
Have your cocktails elsewhere
The food, however, is very fresh
Try the Ricotta Gnocchi -- it's unbelievable
If you don't have to wait for your table, it's a delicious experience -- although a bit pricey
There aren't very many restaurant of this quality in this area (Hell's Kitchen) so ESCA is a name worth remembering
Works both as romantic and as a group of friends, they food is excellent and very fresh
The chef handpicks the fish everything we tried was fantastic
I totally agree with the previous reviews on service and food
Joe was not only charming, but was a wonderful guide to the menu
It's such a pleasure to have a server be so enthusiastic about the food he is helping people order
The raw fish appetizers were amazing -- all of them
don't miss the snapper
We were lucky enough to get a table outside on a nice evening with no humidity
Add the service and the food to that and everybody left very happy
We dined at Esca on April 19, 2005
It was our first time there and the four of us loved it
The server was professional and the sommelier was very helpful
Each course, starting with the crudo, through the grilled octopus and squid, to the pastas with lobster and main courses of sauteed skate, pompano, black bass and seared divers scallops, was superb
It does for Italian seafood what Le Bernadin does for French
The prices, for such high quality ingredients and cooking, are quite reasonable
What a lovely meal I had here last night! I am a big Mario Batali fan, and Esca, like Lupa and Babbo, did not disappoint
Service was impeccable and the restaurant itself is beautiful
I had the brodetto as an appetizer - amazing! I have never seen so many types of shellfish in one bowl, all fresh and cooked to perfection in slightly spicy tomato broth
My monkfish entree was also delicious, although my friend's scallops were a bit overdone
Cheese platter for dessert was nothing special (some of the cheeses were a bit dried out)
Though I didn't taste any of the crudo, all the raw bar options looked incredible
Another winner for Batali!
Cold, efficient service, without a smile, sadly misses the mark at Esca
The sommolier was just short of nasty
Too expensive for good, but not great fare
there are better places to dine
Simply, the service was great but the food was not up to par
Yes, Even the desserts
Not sure why I went
wait my girlfriend dragged me again
Seriously, The food lacked flavor of the Italian cuisine
I felt the dishes had some identity crisis
The ingrdients were asian but poor execution on the dishes' final presentation and coupling of flavors
This was my first Batali experience and I must say that it was an exceptional one
The restaurant itself is on the plain side as far as decor goes but the food is anything but plain
Do not come here with non-seafood eaters as the menu is almost entirely seafood
There are many, many excellent choices from the different categories (raw, cooked, pastas, whole fishes, etc
) but the chef's selection is the way to go
For $65, you will get a 5-6 course tasting menu encompassing a variety of raw fish, cooked fish, pastas, dessert, etc
and every single course was spectacular
Throw in an excellent Italian wine list and some delicious cocktails (the pomegranite bellini and pineapple cosmo were terrific) and you have an all-around excellent meal
It is not cheap, but a good NYC dining experience usually isn't
Catastrofic service great food
I have never been treted this poorly at any resturant the manager who took our orders was very condesending and belittled his customers his attitude and lack of professionalism might be good enough to work at DMV
Can not recommend
If you like fish, this is the place to go! This restaurant's specialty is beautiful fish in every style, including crudi (raw fish, Italian style)
There is garden seating available, which I highly recommend; the interior has absolutely no ambiance and is very small
Prices are moderate: average main course $28
There is an extensive wine list, and every kind of fish imaginable is prepared here
This is truly the best fish I have ever eaten--tender, flavorful and cooked in an elegant oil
I recommend you stick with their wonderful fish, and skip the side dishes and dessert, which were not so exceptional
The service was good, but not excellent; however, the waiter was initially huffy with me when my guest was only 5 minutes late, threatening to make me move! Although the atmosphere was lacking, I could definitely recommend a trip to Esca for the fish alone!
Visit Esca if you seek exceptionally fresh fare and creative pastas and side dishes served with a smile
This is a restaurant for people who can appreciate the nuances in using the right herbs and oils to bring out the best qualities of any dish
My fiancee and I took our friends there for their anniversary and received exceptional service
We each ordered different pastas, entrees and deserts and shared the dishes between us
Each dish was excellent
Esca is not for the pedestrian diner
It is also not cheap, but you do get that for which you paid
We will definitely be returning and sending our friends to experience Esca for themselves
Esca surrounds you with honest, intense, simplicity that focuses on freshness rather than meticulously sculpted presentation
I'm one of the most demanding people I know when it comes to food and service in a restaurant but I must say that I was blown away by the expert and cordial service, the inventiveness of the menu, and the beauty of the room
Batali seems to be one of the few Italian chefs in this town that understands that Italian cooking is much more than, 99 ways to cook a tomato
Highlights: Anything off of the Crudo menu; deep but not overwhelming Italian wine list; marvelous whole roasted fish for two
I recently went to Esca for lunch and was very satisfied
The salt crusted whole sea bass was moist, simple and delicious
Perfectly baked and deftly prepared by our servers
The service was impeccable
we never were in want of anything and barely even noticed their presence

Service was good and the fish appetizer sequence (starts with a wonderful oyster) was not tbe beaten
All food was excellent
Whoever is running this place should be hired to help out on all fronts with Babbo

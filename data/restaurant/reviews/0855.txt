But on tuesday, I ordered the deep dish pizza for delivery, and received a thin crust, which defeated the purpose of satisfying that craving
After calling to complain, they sent us a BURNT deep dish pizza, of which was not even edible
La Villa's quality is on the decline
I certainly won't be eating there again
Almost EVERYTHING this place serves is good
Your tastebuds are teased but the incredibly good garlic bread at the table
You absolutely must try the homemade meatballs as an appetizer! The calamari is equally as good
Everyone's entrees were delicious! The pizza speciale was great and so was the La Villa Special entree! I've been here before and had pizza with smoked mozzerella
smoked mozzerella doesn't belong on pizza
Keep that in mind
I wish we had room for dessert but it was late and we were all getting tired
All the patrons are loyal customers and you will be, also!
Having been to La Villa for dinner several times now, I have to say this place is awesome! Although on the weekends, there is usually a wait for a table if you go there for dinner, it's well worth it
The service has always been excellent (the staff is very attentive and pleasant)
The food is out of this world - everything is fresh and delicious! The servings are huge (you will most likely end up taking home a doggie bag)
The menu offers a huge selection from appetizers to pastas to the out of this world desserts
A decent selection of wines as well
La Villa is a great place for a casual, fun dinner with friends
THIS PLACE WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A FRIEND IN JERSEY
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON BUSINESS SO I STOPPED FOR DINNER WITH MY WIFE
ANYONE WHO KNOCKS THIS PLACE IS EITHER REALLY JEALOUS OR JUST DOESN'T KNOW GOOD ITALIAN FOOD
SAN MARZANO TOMATOES AND THE HIGH GRADE INGREDIENTS THEY USE THERE ARE ALL EVIDENT IN THE QUALITY OF THE DISHES WE SAMPLED
I TOLD LENNY ,WHO INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS ONE OF THE OWNERS,THAT I WOULD BE BACK
The pizza is almost as bad as the inattentive service
The pasta dishes are drenched in olive oil
My husband and I were there for the first time two weeks ago and loved it
It was a bit crowded and Noisy but I guess thats always a good sign
We went back last night and it was calmer
He loves the Pizza Margherita and I the eggplant Parm!
Its a beautiful place and with lovely wait staff
But, the food is wonderful and always fresh
We order for delivery more than we eat in because of our work schedule and its the next best thing
We always loved fifth ave for blue ribbon and moutarde and now we have a new love, La Villa! They salads and pizza's are fantastic and portions are out of control!! It gets crowded but lunch is cool and tranquil
We got delivery of a large pizza - cost was $20
00
The toppings were half off of the pizza, the crust was soggy, burnt, too much sauce, sausage tasted bland
Why can't SOMEONE in park slope make a decent pizza? This place isn't it
$20 for a pizza that is worth maybe $5? Never again
Go to Grimaldi's and forget about this place
I feel terrible for posting such a glowing review earlier in the summer - on our first few visits, the food and service was truly excellent
Having been three times since, both have steadily and severely declined
The last time we went, I was actually mortified at how poor the service was (25 minutes before anyone even came to pour us water after we sat down, and the place was EMPTY) and how lousy the food was - any corner pizza stand makes better pasta and pizza than this
Something happened to this place, and now, it SUCKS
SAVE YOURSELVES - DON'T GO - there are at least 10 fabulous restaurants within 5 blocks of this place
I went there based on previous reviews, and I am disappointed
The service was awful, the waitress was rude, and they asked for our order before we even had a menu
The food was so-so, there are far better restaurants than this
Don't even bother going there!
Once again proving that D
O
C means absolutely nothing
Sorry, this is no Nicks, not even the same ballpark
Can't hold a candle to Grimaldi's or Patsy's either
Not to say it that it couldn't be
They've got a sweet oven
They need to eat at these places and see how much cheese and sauce they use
La Villa uses too much cheese sauce, The sauce is so-so and the cheese could be better
The crust is a little too thick
If you're in Park Slope and you want a pie, this is your place, taking into account that pizza in Park Slope generally blows
We have eaten there quite a few times now and its always been good, fresh and wonderful
Prices are So reasonable especially for park slope and its a very nice place
It gets a bit crowded at night but I guess thats always a good sign
We actually enjoy eating there earlier for lunch definatly a more relaxed atmosphere
Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money
Can't wait to go back
This is a restaurant with wonderful middle eastern food
They have the best hummus I have found in the city, splendid breakfast sandwiches, the pink-mint lemonade is heavenly, the home-made croissants flakey, and the strawberry preserves unmatched
The catch is
you can often go into this restaurant full of culinary delights to find they are out of everything
And I mean, EVERYTHING
The lesson with Grand Cafe is always call ahead
If they have everything in stock, it is a guaranteed meal, if not, your visit will be full of disappointments
Italian classics and romance go hand in hand in this West Village trattoria and wine bar
In Short The red hued dining room and bar lead to a snug outdoor garden, laced in brick and ivy, that welcomes romancers
The traditional Italian fare includes grilled filet mignon or portobello mushroom lasagna, warm goat cheese salad and Mediterranean spaetzle
The menu caters to rack of lamb fans and vegetarians alike, with an ample choice of meat-free dishes complemented by an affordable and extensive wine selection that includes house standards and a reserve list
who ever has given this place great reviews is crazy this is not , not italian food, its pizzeria food, if you want italian go to po' in cornelia,too expensive , service inconsistent good looking place inside but thats were it ends
From the great reviews, I was expecting a little more
Went on a really nice night when every other restaurant was packed
there was no one in the entire place
It was good that we had the place to ourselves and the outside garden was beautiful
I had the penne which was delicious but I asked for it without mushrooms (and repeated myself twice) but it still came full of mushrooms
I didn't complain but it wasn't like the waitress was swamped
Oh well
Overall, it was decent, but I've been to much better
LEARN FROM MISTAKES!!! The meal wasn't acceptable
Decor is nice but worth $50 for a 2-course meal? NO! 10+ppl in our group, different entree for each, not 1 of us liked it
Every complaint was heard
Sole was bland, snapper was salty, lasagne was tough, clams were bad, penne was undercooked, duck - ick
After $58/pp, most of us left hungry!   Never compelled to write a review UNTIL NOW
AVOID THIS PLACE! Don't pay a considerable amout of money for an unworthy meal!  Also, they lie, I specifically asked if it was kid/toddler friendly
The person on the phone said Absolutely! LIE! They don't even have highchairs! Kid-friendly doesm't mean you like kids, it means that kids and adults will enjoy their meals without having toddlers sit on their laps while eating or requiring the parents to bring their carseats for dinner
WHAT A JOKE!!!!
I love Andavi even more each time I visit
In an area filled with Italian restaurants Andavi is a great find
The food is delicious and the service is excellent
I tried the veal cheeks
They were awesome

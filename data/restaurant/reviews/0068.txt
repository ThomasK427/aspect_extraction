Vatan isn't your typical N/S Indian restaurant as you can tell by the polarized reviews
If you're looking a spicy vindaloo or a tikka masala head to a curry house instead
For the rest, it is a great opportunity to sample a plentiful and varied menu from the largely vegetarian Indian region of Gujrat
The elaborate decor recreates a small village, centered around a large banyan tree
Most will find it charming/romantic while some a little kitschy (as all theme restaurants are)
It's just like being in India without the heat, cows, scooters, nosie and pollution - Hmmm
Expect prix-fixe thali style dining - they will bring more of any dishes you like
Keep in mind, Gujarati food is not known for being spicy - so if you like it hot, ask for VERY spicy
I think its great only in NY could you find something so authentic
ALmost 99
9% of Indian restaurants in USA or UK serve food that has absolutely no similarity of food you eat at home
This one is REALLY authentic (both in decor and taste)
If you go to any joint on Lexington, it is like going to Pizza Hut to enjoy real Italian food!!! This one definetly made mo home sick
The service is indeed bit uptight
If you're the tourist crowd I suppose you might like this place but by New York standards the interior is kitschy and the food boring(and I asked for extra spice!)
The service was ok until the place started to crowd up then I got the feeling they wanted us to settle the tab and go
No problem, I was bored by the food and the atmosphere too
Definately for the Disney crowd-they'll think they saved the trip to Epcot
New Yorkers have better choices nearby
My experience at Vatan was fantastic from start to finish
Unlike some of the other reviews here, the reservation was upheld, the waiter took the time to explain each dish and frequently asked if we wanted more of anything (which we did, several times)
The food was excellent (even for a die hard meat lover)
I would definitely recommend this place
Everyone is entitled to their opinion but all the 10 reviews are WRONG
I too couldn't get in the first time I tried because of a reservation mix up
I should have taken the hint but I went again with some friends(one of whom is Indian)
The interior filled with plastic palms and fake bambo isn't romantic as another reviewer noted-it's corny
My Indian friend thought it was an insulting cliche
He also thought the food rather one noted and rote
No way was it just like home
I agree with the previous reviewer who suggests going to Lexington Ave
This place can't touch the food at Madras Mahal or Pongal
MUCH nicer atmoshere too
Two weeks ago I was in the city with some friends looking for some traditional indian food
Being vegetarians they have everything we were looking for
Great samosas, tasty khichidi, and a great selection of wine
The price is well worth the quality and quantity of food
I would suggest this place to anyone who enjoys good food, beautiful atmosphere, and prompt and courteous service
I went there with a group of friends and found the service to be extremely rude and inattentive
The food was horrible and bland, servings were extremely small
They balked when one of my companions asked for seconds
They couldn't wait for us to leave
For the price they charge you, go somewhere else
feels like being in india, everything was great! the food was very good and the service was excelent
special and relexing
Gujurati style vegetarian Indian food--all you can eat, set menu
Excellent option for gatherings of family and friends
I came here with a small group on a Saturday night and was pleasantly surprised by just about everything inside! The interior is gorgeous (very Shangri La, complete with a tree and a wishing well), the food was very good and plentiful, the service was great, and you really cannot beat the price! It was also wonderful for those who have a hard time making up their mind what to order, because you get a little of everything and then more of whatever you liked
For those who don't like that you have to make a reservation, to the restaurant's credit, this allows the restaurant to remain uncrowded and seat you immediately (at least this happened to my party)
Would be great for a large group or even for a first date
I will definitely return!
A unique experience well worth the price
The food was good, not the best I ever had but very plentiful
The meal included several appetizers, main dishes, breads, and desserts
The decor was beautiful, all hand painted, waitresses dress in traditional costume and offer explanations of all dishes
A great introduction to indian cuisine, and lots of fun
I see I wasn't the first and probably not the last to get the shaft with reservations
I left a request on their answering machine with my number to call if there was a problem
Didn't get a call so I thought all was ok-they didn't have a reservation and wouldn't seat us for over an hour even though no one else was waiting and I saw several empty tables
I have eaten here before and the food is fairly good but why support a place that doesn't respect it's customers
? Sitting on the floor to eat is fun but just a gimmick
Just a few blocks away on Lexington Ave are several vegetarian Indian restuarants severing food that blows this place away
this place is great to go on a date or with a large group of people
the ambiance is very relaxing (i have never been rushed while eating here, but it may be because we easy eat out around 9 or 9:30)
and you sometimes get to eat under little huts (oooh)! the food is very good and varied, and you can ask for more of anything that they bring you
we noticed though that when you ask for your food hot, it is not much spicier than the medium, so that would be my one complaint
otherwise, my favorite indian restaurant in the city
A lovely, Zen experience awaits you in this narrow refectory space
No choices, no stress, no contemplating prices and calories
Instead, you sit and the gracious staff brings you a lovingly prepared, delectably spiced Indian vegetarian meal on a silver platter
Everything's good and the experience is one of the city's most relaxing -- after a meal here, you feel simply rejuvenated and at peace
The vegetarian prix-fixe menu is a tasty value
Even my non-vegetarian friends enjoyed the variety
The staff actually takes the time to tell you about each dish, so you'll get a lesson in Indian cuisine on each visit
The decor is tranquil and initimate
Great spot for a nice quiet dinner for two
Just don't plan on going on a Monday night, as they are closed!
I've been here several times, usually for a birthday party or some group event
The food is certainly better than average, a notch up from 6th Street fare
The waitstaff is friendly, if somewhat lackadaisical
The big draw is the atmosphere: The restaurant looks like it should be at Epcot Center--a convincing re-creation of an Indian Village
The Scene The consistent lines at this bustling Japanese "tapas" hot spot don't lie: Yokocho's fresh, reasonably priced comfort food and social atmosphere draw a youthful clientele of cultural natives and gaijin alike
A 20-foot grill, simple wood-furnished decor and hip Asian-American servers transport you to a lively Tokyo food joint
The Food The extensive menu ranges from top-notch Korean-derived barbecue (the succulent prime rib with bone sizzles in savory pepper-and-apple sauce) to udon noodles to Japanese stews
But the best offerings are the a la carte grilled items, such as the chicken with scallion skewers and asparagus with bacon rolls
Other small dishes, such as the fragrant sesame oil-scented raw spicy tuna, are excellent with a beer-sized mug of cold oolong tea
Also excellent is the okonomiyaki, a tangy cabbage, pork and shrimp frittata topped with bonito flakes and a dollop of mayonnaise
my sister and i always go for kaisendon and satisfy my yamaimo cravings
i'm not a fan of the okonomiyaki here but the prices are very reasonable and we always leave happy! seared fatty salmon is yumm and they have my favorite oo-long hai! HAI!!
love the food
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food
it helps if you know what to order
and you can't beat the prices
highly recommended
came to the restaurant with three friends on a quiet sunday afternoon
great looking place with a wide assortment of wonderful food
great yakitori, even better to try the raw crab and fried tofu
Very popular style Izakaya (Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes )
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers
If you like Sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try Yokocho

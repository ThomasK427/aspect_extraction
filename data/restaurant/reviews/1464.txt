in short, this is a pass
Perfectly reliable place for delicious food, especially if you live in the neighborhod
2 things you must try if it is your first time: Thier signature Je'Bon noodle soup and their salmon rolls
The noodles are infused with a fish and the fish broth was very tasty as well (and I'm not a fishy broth kind of guy)
The salmon roll was amazing
indescribable
Good decor and prompt seating
I was so hungry this night, and jumped into this nice looking restaurant
It decorated in an American style, dim light, romatic feel
However, I don't think it is worth the money eating Asian food in this place
The ice smoothies are so sweet that make you wonder how much sugar they put in
On the other hand, the soup was so clear and you taste no salt
The noodles are ok, but the food presentation is no good
I don't think I will ever go back to this place
Met some friends for dinner last night and we went to Je'Bon under other friends' recommendation; what an awesome recommendation it was
We had a bunch of scallop, beef, pork, chicken skewers, salmon rolls and kichinabe
It's safe to say that Je'Bon has a most mouth-watering menu; everything sounds so deliciously edible
I decided on trying the Je'Bon noodle soup for the main entree
The noodles are absolutely nothing like what I've ever had before, and I'm quite the food connoisseur
The noodles seem to have some fish infused in them, and nicely flavored
I'm definitely going back to Je'Bon with more friends
I don't remember the last time I've gone to a restaurant and enjoying ALL of the dishes that I ordered
Oh, did I mention they have a very interesting dcor and helpful waitstaff?  Je'Bon is a definite upcoming hot spot in NYC
THE TUM YIM SOUP NOODLE WAS AWESOME
NEVER HAVE ONE LIKE THIS BESIDE IN THAILAND
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SALMON ROLL KINCHINBA
TELL THEM THAT I SEND YOU
Strange decor, coupled with dishes that seem slopped together with no thought for presentation or subtlety, gave me an experience that I am not looking forward to repeating any time soon
Yes, definitely cheap with most entrees at $8-12, but either bland or strange tasting
The coconut milk sauce we had with one noodle soup was on the bland side - I had expected something like a laksa but nowhere close
And the braised pork noodle had a strange taste like it wasn't quite like anything I'd ever eaten before, and I don't mean that in a good way! The orange and blue lighting were just tacky as well
I have already went a couple times since it first open
I am just suprised by all the dish are unique and tasty
Kachinabe is a great first dish, the skewer is awesome, Poker/Chicken/Mackeral Skwers are all worth a try
Aberdine fried noodle really give a taste of HK fried noodle
But most of all, the Pork Tender Noodle is just the best, the broth is so well made and get me drooling every time i thought of it
It is hard to get around such Asian/Chinese restaurant in NYC with such quality and decor
I ate at this noodle shop around beginning of March
I believe they just opened then
Food and service was somewhat OK
This past Tuesday night I went back with 2 freinds and we were suprised
They had an expanded menu with some items I really enjoyed
The seaweed salad was my favorite
I tried the JeBon Hot Broth Noodle wihich they claimed is First in New York and it turned out to be a winner too
I also noticed they had added a line of Bubble Tea
My friends liked them very much
We went to Je'bon on the recommendation of one of my best friends and we had a wonderful dinner overthere
I love noodles and I can say that I can't find any better noodle house than Je'bon, special mentions are the siu long bao, satay beef noodle and the hot and spicy Tung Yum noodle soup, those are my favorite dishes! Great food, cool decor and the service is flawless
I live in Long Island and it takes me about 45 minutes to get to the city, but I think it is worth the trip and I can recommend Je'bon to anyone for any occasion
I go to St
Mark's a lot, usually for Japanese food
I checked out this new restaurant the other night
Being an Asian, i've always missed the soups that we spent hours and hours to prepare at home
Unfortunately, I can't find any good asian soup place in nyc, not even in Chinatown
So when I had the Braised oxtail noodle soup, I really feel back home
The soup has all the delightful taste of the oxtail and other ingredients
Recommended appetizer: ALL SKEWERS (they actually taste better than that of Yakitori, maybe because the meat is less burnt and being marinated longer so its more tasty)
They have a special dumpings dish worth trying
Like those Cantonese dim sum thing
Recommended dishes: Oxtail noodle soup, my friend said their satay beef noodle, wine chicken, and tender pork noodle were excellent also
I was with my friends on last friday and see a new restaurant in St Marks
I think they are coping Republic but the food is much better and special the Jebon noodle
It was fresh fish noodle, just like the iron chef in food channel
The noodle broth is very tasteful
We are going back again on this Firday
One of the better noodle house in the city!!! Amazing Broth, fish Broth is a must try
Great food and inexpensive
Definitely going back
Upon walking through the large stainless steel glass doors, I quickly became enveloped in the restaurant's young club like atmoshpere
The tinted brick walls had orange light panels glowing across and looking far back from my seat, an extremely well designed yet exotic art piece
After watching the dishes be distributed, I noticed each had a unique decorative scent and seemed as if the cooks pampered them to perfection in aroma as well as to the eye
The fish broth had every aspect of Asian Spiced noodles and a little more than just spice
One of the spacious restaurant found in St
Marks, offers a warm setting
Its a great value for trying various types of asian cuisine
I usually don't write review but read
I went to St
Marks last night with my friends for dinner
We wanted to go to Taisho orginally
but wind up Jebon coz it looked fancy from outside, so we gave it a shot
Can't believe that inside of jebon is spaciuos and hip
Their open-kitchen looked neat n clean
We started off with bunch of small eats (appetizer)
Wow, the skewers over there are so delicious
i can say they beat Taisho a big time
Rest of the appetizers were great too, like the japanese special fried dumpling and siu long bun
Too bad we kept on reordering the appetizer
thus our stomach were full n can't move on to the noodle part
Jebon, we will definitely go back to try out your noodles
salmon roll
omg its so good
i thought it was sushi and it was a spring roll
so good
love the brick walls
and the pan fried dumplings served in a pan
With so many restaurants serving food with tons of flavor, I must admit I will not go back here
It was not horrible
I finished my food
I did enjoy the chips and salsa
Guacamole was bland, just chunks of avacado with almost no seasoning

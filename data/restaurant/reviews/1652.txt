Now it's worse than going to a McDonalds'
The food is cold, it was probably sitting there all day and the portions are unusually small
I would highly recommend you to skip this BBQ and opt for one of the other locations, like 72nd street or 44th street
This is a great place if you are looking for a good hearty meal on a budget
My fav
the quarter white meat chicken with baked potato and corn bread = $4
95
a dollar extra gets you either honey bbq or regular bbq! And if you are into a drink
their Texas size Pina Coladas at $6
95 is the only drink you need!! Lots of locations in the city
the one on 23rd is great
the one on 43rd is really noisy!
If you like Dallas BBQ, you'll like this place--it's just another part of that chain
Moderately good ribs in a city in need of soul food
Go here if you're in the neighborhood, but don't go out of your way
I went to NY this weekend, and this restaurant was strongly recommended
I went, and I was very pleased
The ribs were EXCELLENT
I ate every last bit of them (aside from the bones, of course)
The sauce was great
The mashed potatoes were strange (they have sweet potatoes in them, I think) but tasted good
The macaroni and cheese was to die for! This is truly a GREAT restaurant with GREAT prices
Cheap, Great, and Tasty BBQ Style cooking are all things which charecterize this restaurant all set in a laid back atmoshpere with excellent service
Lunch or Dinner, Broke or Rich, this place is a must visit for college students and families alike
This was some of the best BBQ I've had! And finally, a place with beef ribs! I don't know what kinda sauce it was but the BBQ sauce was bangin
The prices were really unbelievable b/c they were so low
Everything was great
The only thing is the tables are close together so you could easily hear someone's life story
Other than that
no complaints from this satisfied customer!
This is a really fun place! The food is great, and very cheap
A great place to have dinner or lunch
I recently visited Royal with a large group of people
It was truly a great experience
This place could quite simply have the nicest and most attentive staff in New York
In addition, the food was delicious
The Tandoori chicken and the spicy shrimp dish (I think it was called shrimp Vanderloo) were my favorites
The decor of the restaurant is very festive
there are christmas and chili lights hanging from every single crevice
Very gawdy and FUN! The staff was superb and the outside garden was quaint and looked like a big Arabian tent
The group I was with had been there before and suggested that we bring our own beers, but the restaurant did serve wine
I would definitely reccommend it and will return soon
The Scene At the start of 2002, Pop unveiled its 70-seat back lounge, which has quickly become the private party go-to for sparkly celebs and the fashion set
Unlike the open-front dining room, the boldly banquetted back offers a more casual dining experience, complete with plush red benches and light blue pillow rolls, Knoll chairs, mirrored cafe tables and a generous display of Pop Art
The Food The menu of appetizers (or "pops") offers blue point oysters, tuna tartar and mini burgers
Entrees like tempura tuna roll with hot and sour soy and roasted rice are inventive, but not intimidatingly so--a light tempura crust tones down the salty nori taste that more traditional rolls afford
Standards like grilled filet mignon and roasted chicken strike a fitting balance of comfort and glamour, leading into treats such as Belgian waffles with banana ice cream
Picture this
First Date- Hot guy-Beautiful Restaurant-NO AIR!  When we were told where to sit, the host suggested we sit closer to the front-it would be cooler due to the opening to the street
Our waitress came over-very very sweet! I asked about the air-she said it had been broken for almost a week! I then asked to see a manager
About 5 mins later she tells me that he says he's busy!  Drinks come-NOTE-GREAT drinks!!!  When the food hits the table I ask the food runner-may I speak to the manager?  A young man leaves the bar from flirting with a girl-note again- dressed in Jeans that my 16 year old brother would wear-ya know 3 times bigger and lower than they should be
I mention it is VERY hot in the Restaurant- I know it's one more week whatever that means! I proceeded to tell him- we almost left before our dinner arrived
He said nothing just ,I KNOW Then he proceeded to sit with 2 girls 3 tables down to socialize again
We paid our 80 dollar bill then got the hell outta there
Thank GOD my date let me come home and take another shower-NOT KIDDING! Who is the owner that is allowing this manager to represent this place?
After a Sunday afternoon of wandering and shopping (and a horrible lunch earlier) we needed to find somewhere quiet to have a drink
Pop wasn't featuring the last game of the World Cup so it was pretty quiet
We were attracted to the special advertized outside
Our visit was highlighted by really delicious mojitos, tasty little mini burgers, and the ability to chat comfortably in the private setting of the back lounge area
Our waiter was fairly friendly and unobtrusive
Nothing earth shattering, but just what we needed
Pop is big, not mammouth but big enough to make you feel like you're walking into a wealhty friend's cool living room
The music is good but, there is no dancing
The crowd is attractive and the drinks are inventive
Overall, a great place to kick back with friends but not the place for wild night out
I liked the atmosphere a lot, it was like being in a dimmly lit room with unpretentious hipsters
Flirtinis Pink Panty Pull Downs are popular drinks ordered by men woman
The fried calamari, onion rings, fried chicken rolls w/chile aioli dipping sauce mini burgers are delicious finger foods to share
Wild mushroom truffle pizza is great
For dinner, the favorites: Chilean sea bass, filet mignon, tempura tuna roll, fried chicken, grilled lamb chops lemon fettuccine
Want a snack? Get a burger w/fries or a chicken avocado sandwich
The chefs are really cool about substituting things on your plate
If you want certain condiments (mustard, mayo, crushed red pepper) let the server know as you're ordering the meal- you won't have to wait for it
If a relaxing night is what you want, STAY AWAY from Friday after 9pm Saturday after 9pm
Theres a hip hop DJ that shows up at 10pm on both days
It'll be filled with a loud, young, dance crowd
We needed a last minute place to go to eat with friends
We were able to get right in
poss
because is was labor day weekend
We decided to share a number of appetizers
The truffle pizza was great
The mini burgers were good but a little dry
The asian shrimp appetizer was very good but the lobster nacho was nothing to write home about
But my wife really loved the flirtini that was on the menu
I really enjoy the ambience at pop, and the drink selection is strong
But I have to comment on the poor service and overpriced food
Our waiter was missing for the majority of the evening, and after asking several times for a glass of wine, we finally had to get up and get it from the bar ourselves
When he re-surfaced, he didn't even have the courtesy to apologize for not bringing it
The food is tasty, but certainly not good enough to warrant the cost
Bottom line: It's a good place to meet up with friends on a weeknight and have a few quiet drinks -- the service will certainly let you hang out in peace as long as you'd like, sometimes to a fault
ok so it's not 2002 anymore but I would still take pop over its trendy meatpacking sibling anyday! The staff is great again
The lounge is packed on weekends again
But the true pop experience is enjoying a quiet Tuesday nite when it's a little slow and you can sit there, relax with a friend or two, and enjoy the best mini-burgers in NY or that fabulous mushroom/white truffle oil pizza with your Flirtini, or in my case, Stoli Ohranj Cosmo
Had a party there recently
They reserved us a spot in the back that held the 35 people in the party pretty well
Drinks were average price for NYC and to reserve a spot in the back lounge there's a 2 drink minimum for each of your guests which can covered pretty easily
Music was nice, crowd was young, and there was porn on the projector
With excellent house cocktails (their nouvelle mojito kicks arse), an atmosphere that's hip yet inviting and a waitstaff that's surprisingly competent given that they're all so cute, this is a great spot for an after work cocktail or post-movie dinner (it's right around the corner from the Union Square 14 cinema)
It's spacious, refreshingly un-crowded and the food is above average

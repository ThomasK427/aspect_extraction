what a great place
I have been several times and everything from the fondue to the cheese platters to the wine is outstanding
Having lived in Switzerland I have high standards but this place definatly is WONDERFUL!!
Great place
Make sure to get the cheese plate in the beginning of the meal because you won't be able to fit it in at the end and you'll be missing the best part
Don't waste your time with the fondue, cheese was meant to be eaten full favored and raw, not melted down
And ask your server for matching wines!
Read a lot of the poor reviews on this site, a lot centering on poor service
We had a great experience at the restaurant, service was fine, nobody was rude
Food was excellent
Had the steak frites which were great
Next time we'll try some cheeses, we were too full after the meal to eat anymore
Hostess gave no introduction and was rude upon arrival
Waiter was inconsistent and never welcomed us to dinner nor with specials
Didn't even care that we were there
Food was average but only came ages after we ordered it
Tried to give a second chance with reservations for the following week and they happily refused to give me reservations unless I placed my Credit Card # over a fax
Horrible Customer First policy
Do not recommend at all!
unfortunately, although i love this place, the service really is terrible
lose the attitude, kids, you are WAY too condescending for your own good
The waitress also spilled on my lap and on the table in front of me and thought nothing of it
We cancelled the rest of our order, since we waited for so long
the manager came over to see what the problem was, and when told about the spillage, asked me if i would like a napkin for that with a wonderful smirk on her face
She argued with us as well that we had not been waiting very long
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?! It seems they dont agree with the customer always being right mentality
Anyway, the service was bad enough for me to take my time to write this wretched thing
Whatever
Came here with a friend on an early Saturday night
We sat at the bar and looked at the menu
The bartender hurried us along and told us not to order their first fondue, Swiss cheese
He said it was too sweet and boring
We ordered a couple of others, they tasted fine, but not anything that spectacular
Our wine was hidden away most of the time and they really made us feel unwelcome
As I said, whatever
The place was full of odd looking, overdressed single women and older gentlemen eager to meet them
Blah
Putting aside the cheese (which is better than almost all other restaurants in the city) for a moment, this is a great French bistro, with typical bistro entrees but also a number of newer, original concepts
Great service in the American (a little less formal but just as efficient) rather than the French tradition
Don't forget the wine list, which has a lot of reasonably-priced choices
The wine list and cheese selection are outstanding
This is the best place to meet a friend for a drink and share a cheese plate
I have had several meals here as well and would walk across hot coals for their mac and cheese!
This place isn't worth the money you will spend on dinner
Go for lunch, but call about a half hour before you go to make sure you have a seat
Even then, they will act like they are doing you a favor by having a table for you
The food is excellent, but the service is slow and unfriendly
The food cannot compensate for the ridiculous incident we witnessed while dining at Artisinal
We watched as an irate maitre d' actually snidely -and loudly- suggested that a customer try eating at McDonald's when he could not accomodate their party which had been waiting for as long as we'd been there (at least 45 minutes)
This same maitre d' was also rude to us during our time there and although the rest of the staff was lovely, he cast a cloud over our evening
I've read other reviews that have brought up several complaints about Artisinal
A few points of rebuttal: The restaurant is warmer than most restaurants because for cheese aficionados, the best cheese experience is when the stuff is served at room temperature
Traditionally, cheese is served at the end of a meal, which is why the waiters offer you the massive cheese list later in your dining experience (and sometimes you have to explicitly ask for it)
In other words, Artisinal is a hard-core experience
My husband and I dined there on January 24, 2004
I read a lot of great reviews so I thought I'd give it a try
Great cheese fondue and chocolate fondue for dessert
The main courses were rather sparse and nothing great
I had to ask for a cheese menu (since they specialize in 200+ cheeses)
I was interrupted by the waiter to say that when we are done with dinner he'd bring one
Gee
maybe I wanted cheese for an appetizer or course?  Service was cold, except for the hostess who was charming
A little pricey for cold service
I'll probably try others before going back
Though cheeses hit the mark, table service is an unfortunate afterthought
The scene: the now familiar erzatz bistro, namely, a set and not the real thing
Why is it that in Paris the dining room proportions and decor so often seem to fulfill some divine law, the service there moves like a ballet, where in the U
S
, Fawlty Towers comes more often to mind?  Venue never fails outright: raw oysters are excellent, salads honest and nicely-composed, the mains satisfying
One could spend many visits exploring the cheeses with the guidance of the friendly and sophisticated cheese master, this being the only reason for a visit to Artisanal
Unfortunately, kitchens efforts are not matched at table: service is perfunctory, disjointed, uninformed, and mostly-absent
Cheeses get short shrift by waitstaff, who all seem hurried
Dont go late as the lights dim suddenly at 10:40, the better to rush you out at closing
I was rather disappointed with the restaurant
I've read so many great reviews that I had to give it a try
The service was adequate at best
We couldn't understand of work of what our waiting was speaking
Not to mention the fact that he farely gave us the time of day, let alone the attention a restaurant of this calibur should
While the fondue and soup was great, the entrees were terrible average
but make reservations!  The food is delectable; truly magnificent
the gougeres and escargots are a must
Each entree is carefully crafted and it shows
ask your server or the sommelier to match a wine (off their extensive, great value list) and you will never be failed
Then, to cap it off, spend some time with the fromaggier and select from the world's finest cheeses and pates
(Oh, and the desserts are worth talking about, too)
You must eat the cheese fondue (I usually have a special one - my favorite was made with carmelized onions) with medium rare beef tips!! I have never had a bad experience
Once your nose acclimates to the pungent stench (of cheese), it is smooth sailing - great food and wine!
After dining at Artisanal and probably having one too many, I incorrectly added the total amount to be credited to my charge
After reviewing my card balance I noticed the mistake and Artisanal pulled out a copy of my bill and credited my acct for the mistake
It was a pleasure dealing with the management
Additionally, we all loved our entrees and the cheese plate dessert!!! Very enjoyable experience
Went here on a Sunday afternoon
The place is very nice and welcoming
This restaurant offers typical French fare, oeufs, steak-frites, salad nicoise, etc
nothing special, with the exception of the cheese menu
This is the real reason to go here
If you love cheese, they have a huge menu, which is delicous
Otherwise, they also have a good 3-course $20 brunch bargain
But I don't think that I would go here again for a meal, I would just buy cheese at the 'shop' inside and leave
Heard that Artisanal was the 'Cheese Temple of NYC' so being a cheese lover, I had to check it out

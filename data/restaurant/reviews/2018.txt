I thought i was in heaven
The next day went to john's, boy was i in for a shock
The pie had little flavor
The best part of john's was its location
I went to Johns because it is so well reviewed, the same reason I'd gone to Grimalde's
The difference being that Grimalde's tastes GREAT, and John's tastes BAD
The service was good, better than Grimalde's and I liked the vibe of the place
However, the great service, and a good vibe can't offset how horrible the pizza there was
I two main problems with it: 1) the cheese
Their cheese was not fresh mozzarella it was mozzarella and it was probably fresh, but that's not the same
The type of cheese they use at John's is no different from the cheese used at any run-of-the-mill pizza by the slice place
And there's too much of it on top of such thin crust, making the proportions wrong
2) Poor craftsmanship
Some slices had almost no toppings and others had far too much
The sauce, while good, was equally poorly distributed
Don't be fooled by the name
Come here for great pizza, but not for anything else
Aside from pizza, menu is limited
Very high ceiling (it's a former church) creates sense of openess (a nice change from the congested nature of nyc), but increases noise
There is a big difference between a popular pizza store and the best pizza store
I have found John's pizza to lack flavor in the cheese and have a bland sauce
NYC is the home to many weak pizza shops
I wouldn't say John's is the best in the world, as their popularity incease, their quality is slipping a bit over the years (go to Totonno's in Coney Island to experience that!), but you have to put them right up there among the top!  You simply can't ignore a great pie of John's pizza, and a picture of beer as probably one of the all time great New York gastronomical experiences! Being on Bleeker St
also helps!  The fresh ingrediants, that great sweet sauce! I'm getting hungry already
I've eaten pizza all over Manhattan (unfortunately, I've never been to Brooklyn, where I hear the pizza is best), including all of the top spots according to CitySearch, and this place is at best, so-so
I've eaten here twice (you can't judge a place on a single pie), and I had black olives the first time, regular cheese the next
The cheese, sauce, and bread aren't special
The olives were delish, though, and that's been tough to find in the city
Famous for the pictures of Robert Deniro in the window
Crowded
People were drinking red wine with their pizzas
Please
It's all hype
There is not a trip I make to New York that doesn't include a visit to John's Pizzeria to enjoy not only the outstanding pizza but the out of this world Pete's a Rolls(the sausage are my favorite)
Oh and did I mention they also have a great salad too
When I go it usually cost more to park than it does to eat!!!!!! Mid-town location  Thanks, kittycat872 from VA
Probably the best Pizza in the world, including Italy! Food is fabulous, atmosphere is great and price is fabulous
Excellent pizza
Wow
Ordered one extra cheese and one pepperoni for the office
Delicious even after a 15 minute subway commute back
Everyone here liked it
Excellent, excellent, excellent
I've passed John's Pizzeria many times, but they don't sell slices
I could not justify ordering a whole pie until today
I'm very glad I was in the area, and it all worked out nicely
One of the very best I've ever tasted
When in New York, John's is always a destination restaurant
We walk from updown to downtown
It is almost a pilgrimage
The pizza was terrific
The service was the worst I've ever had
We were given no napkins and had to ask 3 times before getting them
When server brought tab, we found out why service was so bad
Groups of 5 or more had tip automatically added
(We were a group of 6)
I'd go back for the pizza, but would make sure it was a smaller group
John's survives on it's rep for being the best
Besides finding their pizza to be just OK, I found that their service differs depending on race
John's is definitely one of the best, but their crust is just not as tasty as Patsy's
And I by Patsy, I only mean the one on First Ave in Harleem
When it comes to pizza places, John's put's the eats a in pizza!!! If you could compare their food to art, this food is the Louvre of trattoria style Italian food
The only pizza I ever ate that actually seemed greaseless
No globs, but gobs of taste through cheese
Awesome!
Have been gone from Manhattan for 19 years and the tast of a large pie, extra cheese and fresh garlic, fresh from the oven in the original section of John's still lingers
I visit here first on every trip back from Colorado
No mistakes or whammys
John's delivers, figuratively speaking
Gotta go to the joint
well worth the trip
I used to like this place
because it used to be open late when I lived around the corner on Sullivan street
I WILL say, it was the best LATE NIGHT pizza in town!  You must remember
ANY pizza in NY is better than anywhere else
The slop they serve up here in the San Francisco area should be called something else!
johns pizzeria offers great pizza at a reasonable price
the atmosphere is great, and the pizza is amazing
john's is the closest I've tasted to Chicago pizza (not the deep dish) that I've tasted out east
It's the BEST
John's Pizza is by far the best pizza in the country, let alone new york city
It is different from, but stands up to pizza from italy itself
its very good, its not a life altering culinary experience
brick open type pizza cooked like it is in italy
but sometimes they burn it
sauce is really tasty
The crust was the best but the mushrooms and onions part was sorely lacking in the salt or something
I added it and then was ok
There is much better pizza on Staten Island
Gennaro's
YUM! And I'm from the old neighborhood
Still had the same benches from 40 years ago
One of the best pies in the neighborhood! Sliced meatballs atop a chewy crust with just the right amount of cheese and sauce
Definitely go to the one in Village if you've only been uptown
My and my boys LOVE John's
It's got a comfortable, rustic pizzeria atmosphere, and plenty of character
Celebs flock to it sometimes, plus they've got tons of signed entertainment, politcal, and sports memoribilia lining the walls
Servers could be a little more alert, but it's nothing big
terrific pizza, close to work, ok service, tight seating, oh, did i mention the terrific pizza !
Very satisfying of its crispy, tastful pizza

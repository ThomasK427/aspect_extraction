We're good peoples too
Oh well, back to Villa Pizza or Song
I have ventured in on two separate occasions - found the cuisine, staff ambience are consistently impressive but disappointed that the place is a bit thin on the patron aspect
I enjoy a place with a bit more live action and wondered where everyone was
I saw them all at the other usual places as I walked my way over from 3rd St-- I suppose most folks find that if they go beyond South Paw they are going into unknown terrain
Back to the cuisine Yes! the Jerusalem bread is light, airy, sprinkled w/ Middle Eastern panache--along with a nice spicy full bodied red from Israel is outstanding
Your palate will be wowed with a brave French cuisine w/warm enticing earthy elements
I LOVE this restaurant! It is an excellent addition to 5th Avenue's restaurant row and worth the visit to Brooklyn
Miriam's has wonderful ambience, excellent wines, creative and delicious food
This is not your typical middle eastern restaurant
Miriam's serves sophisticated, contemporary and delicious cuisine with excellent flavor combinations
We love the appetizers like Jerusalem bread, amazing butternut squash and the mediterranean salad
Carnivores, fish lovers and vegetarians will all find fabulous options
2 favorites are the porkchops the baked tahini grouper
Brunch is also great! You should definitely try Miriam's you won't be disappointed!!
Was walking on 5th ave with a group of friends we decided to eat at Miriam for no reason but out of hunger
There was hardly anyone inside, but the place had a cozy morroccan vibe that made you want to decorate your house like it
I had the eggplant salad--it was to die for!!! Also ate the dorado it was amazing as well
My friend had the chicken shawarma delighted in every bite of it
Another friend had the lamb kabob said it was excellent and everyone agreed that the steak with sweet potatoe fries was phenomenal
The food was presented aesthetically and the waitstaff was attentive friendly
The owner stopped by our table to converse for a bit gave us a bottle of wine to try
He was a very nice guy made our dining experience special
The margaritas are not so special
The menu says that they are made of fresh fruit
Even so they are not well balanced and sour
They were also not blended through properly
The food was not so special for NY where there are many Mexican restaurants
For the price they charge you should get better service too
I made the mistake of not ordering an appetizer and it took 50 minutes to get the main dish
The pork dish was overcooked but the fish dish was not
I went to Centrico on a fairly busy Wednesday night and the service was outstanding
My friend, who is a vegetarian couldnt find any entrees that she could have and when she asked the waiter about it, he suggested a vegetarian risotto that wasn't on the menu but had the kitchen prepare for her
The margaritas were great, as were the guacamole and chips
I had the braised short ribs and they were amazingly tender and flavorful - I highly recommend this dish if you go there
The corn ice cream that comes with the molten chocolate cake is also delicious and goes suprisingly well with the chocolate
Overall, I had a wonderful time at Centrico - outstanding food and service in a casual atmosphere
After much debating back and forth, my friends and I decided to go to Centrico for restaurant week
Needless to say, we were very pleased with our decision
The margaritas were amazing, and so was every part of the meal
The plantains were heavenly, as were all of our entrees
The waitress was great and was very prompt about refilling the chips and guacamole
The desserts (particularly the sorbet) were also delicious
I highly recommend it
Let me just say that our meal here was absolutely terrible
This restaurant is extremely pretentious- they have daily specials, but only VIP's are allowed to hear them
We heard two different servers telling tables about these specials, and when we asked to hear them, they wouldn't tell us them
I guess we were not important enough to know, even though they had no idea who we were
The food was bad, menu very unexciting and drinks were weak
All in all, SKIP this place and go somewhere where EVERYONE can hear what the specials are
All in all it was the worst restaurant experience i have ever had in new york
i wish i could eat there every day, service amazing, the manager the coolest guy, i was there on a tuesday, the birria: out of these world, the real deal, my girlfriend now is in love with chef aaron, thanks mr Nieporent and mr Deniro, we need it a place like these, the real deal in tribeca
I enjoyed my visit to Centrico for a couple of reasons
Reservations weren't too hard to come by, the food is delicious and service was top-notch
We ordered the famous ceviche combo and guacamole
The ceviche was good but being an avocado addict, I loved the guacamole served with freshly fried chips
I had the spicy tiger shrimp and it was perfect
Being a spice lover, I thought the heat was right and the shrimp was incredibly fresh! However, my companions didn't enjoy their entrees as much as I did
The ambiance was subdued and quiet (we went on a Sturday evening)
The service was very good
The waiter who served our table was very knowledgable of the menu, which is always a good sign
My wife and I had a great evening there last night
We loved the cocktails, and like a previous reviewer my wife especially loved the Jala-Pia
We picked a variety of appetizers from the menu in lieu of an entree becuase we are both vegetarians (guacamole, plaintains, quesidilla, etc) and loved every one
The uncluttered decor of the restuant, high ceilings, and lack of tall buildings immediately outside made the whole restaurant feel airy, spacious, and wide open, a welcome change in the city
Service could have been a bit more attentive, the food was good with some dishes outshing others
The decor is too open and sparce and the mismatched chairs have no rhyme or reason
24
07 menu was a deal to try this hip tribeca restaurant but the wrong dessert was sent to the table
Have dined there twice now and don't know whether it's good enough to so again, the drinks are great though!
The only way I would go back is if I go to have drinks
I would not recommend eating there, especially if you are hungry
The food is very bland and the servings are very small
Also- the waitress specializing in tequila is very rude!!
Centrico is a welcome addition to the authenticy war that numerous local Mexican restaurants are waging; clearly, we the patrons are the winners! Having grown up in west Texas (really, almost a completely different state) I have been waiting for a Mexican restaurant that would bridge New York's culinary excellence and Mexico's unique flavor
The menu includes authentic faves (e
g
Pozole) and NY musts (your pick)
Granted, all the kitchen has to compete with in downtown are memories of the Burrito Bar and Burritoville
Nonetheless, this is a winner worth your visit
Two friends and I had a terrific evening on the terrace last night
LOVE the cocktails, especially the Jala-Pia, and the food is excellent - short ribs are meltingly tender and flavorful, grilled chicken is addictive, and the apps (veg
quesadilla, ceviches, frog legs) are so good it was hard to share
Our waiter was adorable and very sweet
So is Shannon, the manager
If you think Mexican food is just tacos and guacamole, try this place!
This place is a riot
I was just there last week and found it to be ok
Some person who looked homeless confirmed I was on the waiting list and after being greeted by the hostesses, was taken through the kitchen and then seated tightly in between 2 couples
Dark, fun atmosphere
Food was ok-corn and shrimp were great
Bar was dead and tables were definitely empty on a Thursday night which was interesting since they are always robotically stating they are completely booked
On our way out the crowd definitely was odd- it was all really frightneningly skinny people with tons of layered clothing to hide their bones and just kind of inhaling the taco smell-totally bizarre
Just last night I stopped in to grab a drink before heading to dinner elsewhere
Yet again another person who looked like they wandered off the streets and hadn't eaten in weeks had a clipboard and told us the bar was closed for a private party
We then called from outside to see if we could get in and we were told whatever the maitr'd decides is what goes
So if you are in need of good mexican but only plan on inhaling the smell of food instead of eating it - this is the place for you
But if you enjoy a nice meal and weigh more than 94 pounds you may as well try Mexican Radio down the block which has great portions, great food and leaves the pretentious snobbery to la esquina- which P
S
has been around too long already to keep up the lame velvet rope act

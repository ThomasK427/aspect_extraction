Ambiance wise it is dark, but stylishly decorated with couches bordered with tables that have a view of K-Town
The place is streaming with US top 40 and smooth Korean songs playing in the background
Service has always been great, very quick and friendly
A word to note: For some of the non-Asians out there, the comfort level may be weary since the majority of the patrons, staff, etc are Korean
This place is recommended in the company of another Asian / Korean
I haven't sampled their menu extensively
Mostly their burgers and fries via delivery to my office
Very good
Very quick service
I also recommend their shish kebab which I had when dining in
Atmosphere is small, flourescent lit, lunch counter style
Not much on ambience
Tony's is the favorite burger place at our office
Every Friday is Tony's day, and our lunch order is eagerly anticipated
The burgers are simply the best in the city, and they arrive very quickly and nice and hot
The fries and onion rings suffer a little in comparison, but are good
I'm not sure I'd want to sit down and eat at Tony's, but they'll always be the first choice for delivery burgers here
I never tasted my first slice of Ray's pizza
I was so hungry that I inhaled the slice my dad and I had gotten to share while we waited for the pie we were going to share with my mom and her family
My mom went to college at the New School and had filled my head with raves about Ray's for over three years before I got to try it
At any rate, it's now become a goal to find a Ray's quality pizza in every town in which we've lived, the search goes on
Tasteless pizza and everything else I've tried there
Slow service
How is this on the best of list? The real Ray's which should be on this list is Ray's on Prince street where you can get a huge delicious homestyle italian meal for a good price
Famous original is anything but
It is the most mediocre pizza in NYC
This pizza is AVERAGE to say the least in NYC, it is greasy
The crust is soggy and just yucky!
the name gets customers in only because they've heard the name Ray before
this is pizza for people who are new to town or just don't have any taste! its an example of capitalism: you can make money based on poor quality
i used to go to a pizza place on Houston St
that was so good
a tiny place however, the pizza was great
one night to my surprise the place was totally renovated and expanded
i figured the owner must have made money and decided to expand his popular business
i bit into the slice of pizza and it was horrible!!!When I left disgusted, I looked at the sign and the name was Ray's
No wonder it sucked
I found out where the original pizza joint moved to: He is right down the street on Orchid and Stanton Streets
I forgot the name, but I remember how good the pizza is
This is as bad as pizza can get
Canned mushrooms
Bland toppings all around
There is just no flavor to it at all
That's what you get for ordering from a chain
Go with an independent
It's the only pizza I will eat when I go to New York!! It is by far the best!!!
By far, the best pizza in the city! Many convienient locations
Go to Ray's today!
The ubiquitous nasty plastic cheese bread that passes for pizza in too many NYC establishments these days
Leaden, often soggy and covered with tasteless, plasticine cheese product
Anybody that thinks that ANY Famous Original Ray's is a Classic NYC slice is seriously mistaken
Ok, maybe classic in the sense that NYU students have probably been dorm-making similar concoctions out of Wonderbread, ketchup and government cheese forever
There are SO MANY great pizza places close by! Joe's Pizza is at 7 Carmine Street
only a few blocks away in distance, and a million miles ahead in quality
NOT THE BEST NOT THE WORST I WOULDN'T BUY IT AGAIN
There is NO substitute, and no better pizza than this 1 and only Rays Pizza on 6th Ave and 11th St in the Village
Once you go there you'll never go anywhere else
If students from England and I from LA have it flown in several times a year we must be crazy about them for some reason right?
This pizza would struggle to earn the adjective mediocre
The crust is far too thick, undercooked, gummy, and doughy; their sauce makes Chef Boy-Ar-Dee seem gourmet; and the cheese is so oily you could run a diesel locomotive for a week on the drippings
A slice of white bread saturated with ketchup and topped with Genuine Imitation Processed American Cheese Food Product would provide serious competition in a taste test
Friends don't let friends eat Famous Original Ray's
This Ray's is Ok if you're stuck in the neighborhood, but if you want excellent pizza, you could do better at Ray's on 6th and 11th, or Ray's on Prince Street near Bowery
Both places offer a better pie, the Ray's on 11th has the best cheese on a slice, and the Ray's on Prince has a pesto slice that will cause you to rethink your entire philosophy of pizza
But for the best combo of sauce, cheese and crust, I can't understand how this site can possibly overlook Stromboli's on University place
It's been my personal favorite for 25 years
This pizza is like lead - it is heavy - I was totally turned off - why is this so poplular?
Wack!!! They were pretty go in the 80's, now they use artificial cheeses and the dough is tough
The last time I was in New York City I had the best pizza in the world
And that's no joke I Live in NY
for thirty yearsbefore I left and when I came for a visit eat there and it has never changed
Thanks Joe
I tried this pizza back 15 years ago and I swear I have never, ever forgotten how good it was
All others pale in comparison
Rock on Ray! Melinda Toronto, Canada
They are so generous with the cheese, and the sauce tastes like one you would make at home, plus it brings back fun memories of days gone by!!
The last time I was there (10/24/02) I had a pizza with little taste
The service was good, but the food lacked any sense of italian ethniticity
The McDonalds of pizza
Everything that is wrong with pizza
New York used to be known for it's pizza now there's very few decent pizzeria left
It's seems the crappy tourist trap ones like Ray's dominate our neighbourhoods
It's a shame that we now have to travel to get good pizza
Breay, doughy, soft crust with huge amounts og cheap cheese
Radio Shack of pizza
My local Ray's seems to catre to the bums that hang out in front
I have always loved pizza, and ever since my favorite pizza place closed when I was eleven, I could never find a pizza that I really loved until I visited New York and discovered Ray's
It is by far the best pizza I have ever had and every time I go back to the city I cannot leave without having a Ray's cheese pizza
That is why I think that it should be #1 on your rating, not #9
Thank you
Best Pizza in New York City
Large plain slices with cheese
Pizza is good
Other dishes fair to good
The place is not very neat, but it is easy to get in and out of if you are short of time
Good, old fashioned pizza New York style
The Best! And, not expensive
great for big groups
No sauce, doughy under cooked crust, but the cheeze is good
Don't bother

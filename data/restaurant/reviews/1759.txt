The lowish ceiling and garden-apartment view of passing feet has claustrophobic potential, but warmth of service and environs makes it cozy instead
The Food The kitchen here loves to impress with cleverly combined, carefully wrought dishes
A chopped salad, incorporating fresh beans, tomatoes, enoki mushrooms, cress and quail eggs is beautifully presented and excitingly complex
A platter of merguez and linguica sausages with local sheep's cheese is likewise handsomely composed and dazzlingly flavorful
Filet of snapper, coated in browned tortilla bits and accompanied by a surprisingly light corn flan, is delicious as well
Only an arid couscous side and an alarmingly underdone pork chop--though delicious on a second attempt--fall short
A perfect pistachio creme brulee with embedded raspberries makes a fine dessert
Went to North Square on a date last night
I neglected to read the caters to an older crowd on the profile page, so was taken aback by the number of over 50s patrons
Though I understand why it's appealing to the older crowd, why isn't it more popular with those in their 20s and 30s?  Seafood entrees were excellent and was presented noticably well
The desert special was to die for
The service was excellent
I can't believe I hadn't heard about it from friends
I guess I'll be the one to circulate the good news!
Had my boyfriend's surprise birthday/anniversary dinner here last night
Everything was SO amazing
It made a special night - magical
Thank you SO much!
This is a lovely little restaurant - traditional decor and comfortable surroundings
I would say it's suitable for a romantic date or quiet family meal, as there is no bar so the atmosphere is a little quiet
The foods is excellent - not too fancy, plenty of choice and very reasonably priced
The service is spot on - the wait staff give just the right amount of attention without fussing too much
One of the good things about this restaurant is that you can order a la carte, making it perfect for those watching cals or carbs! We loved it and will be back soon
Solid place
Special striped bass was good and light, plated elegantly, and with original sides
Partner's snapper was not as good
Appetizer broccoli/leek soup delicious and kudos to the bread and olives to start
Nice cocktails and chill tunes in the background
Would return if I was in the neighborhood
Dinner at North Square has always been good
I'm not crazy about the name change (I liked C3), but hey, who am I to say? The food is almost always solid but creative, with few exceptions like a severely overcooked steak I had once
The wine list is also solid and fair and the dining room pleasant and not too dark
We are so grateful to two dear friends of ours that brought us to dinner one night to North Square
This lovely bistro is located in the Washington Square Hotel where chef Yoel Cruz is creating culinary magic in the kitchen
For an appetizer we had sumptuous grilled marinated shrimps
While our dinner included a grilled aged NY shell steak that was cooked perfectly and full of flavor and a wonderful pan seared saddle of lamb with fava beans, wild  mushrooms and rosemary lamb jus
Delicious!   North Square has become one of our favorite restaurants in NYC, where we can always find elegant food at very affordable prices
North Square continues its predecessor's tradition of excellent food at a surprisingly reasonable price
Great romantic date restaurant
I discovered North Square (then named C3) more than a year ago, and was immediately charmed
Since then, I've become a regular, brought my friends and out-of-town visitors who love the view over Washington Square Park
The food is creative, delicious and very well executed
The wine list is impressive, with many wines by the glass, and my favorite Belgian beer
The decor is warm and welcoming, and the service impeccable
The prices are very reasonable too! Ask to be put on their mailing list, they also organize special events like a recent mushroom dinner that was very interesting
I went to North Square for one of their special events, Mushrooms and Bonny Doon Wines
Wow, what a fantastic experience
Not only was the food innovative and the wine delightful the overall meal was dynomite
The service was attentive and the speakers friendly and informative
I will definitely be back for other events in the future
We went to Sunday Brunch and were pleasantly surprised by a mellow atmosphere, Live Jazz, and good food for the price
The downside--there was only ONE waitress and it was stressful just watching her try to remember everything
If you can relax and aren't in a hurry, try it for brunch
My tablemate enjoyed the Breakfast Tasting which includes a little bit of everything
They also had 3 different kinds of Eggs Benedict: one with Salmon and Spinach, the Traditional kind, and a Crab Benedict
Plus really yummy cranberry walnut bread and a good cappucino
I made a reservation on-line quickly got a call saying that the resturant was under renovation, but the kitchen was still open and was still more than welcome to come enjoy dinner in their lounge
We got there the staff was very friendly accomodating, the lounge was a little small but comfy for just 2 of us, I'm really excited to go check out the new renovations
Why is this rating so low?! This is the greatest sandwich place in New York City-- and I've eaten at them all
Where else can you get hot turkey breast, freshly carved and so warm it melts the cheese? And too many options to add to the sandwich (marinated red onions, spicy mayo, basil pesto mayo), I just let the counter guys take over
Delicious soups, homemade orange lemonade and delicious, soft, seeded Italian heroes
This place is spectacular-- and don't mind the surly counter guys-- they'll warm up to you once they get to know you
i recommend you do the take out routine
try the roast chicken
I held a small gathering of friends at Calidad for a nice Cuban dinner
The food was ok, decor was nothing spectacular, not really a place suitable for groups
The marinated steaks were dry, but the Chicken Marsala was ok
My only complaint was the awful service we received
Our waiter was extremely rude and unfriendly
When he was taking out our orders, he brought out a fish entree dish that no one ordered, but he insisted that we did order it, and refused to take it back
Then at the end of the night, he came and took away our plates when some people were not even done eating yet
The location is a bit shady, and is extremely hard to find parking
I would recommend take-out from this place but not to dine in
We just tried this restaurant and had a great evening there
The food was interesting, perfectly cooked, and beautifully prepared
Generous portions
No tiny servings of overly pretentious food here
The service was perfect and the owner/chef was there to check on how we were enjoying the food
Definitely a great find
Don't be fooled by the construction outside, this is a cosy, romantic place
bavette steak as tough as a boot, unpleasant waiter, disappearing coat check person -- this place certainly does not deserve a high citysearch rating -- never again!!!!
If you have ever felt uncomfortable in a French restaurant because you are afraid of misprouncing the menu then Cafe Loup is for you
It is probably the most unpretencious French restaurant that I have ever been in
The very friendly and helpful staff will more than likely mangle the word more than you do
Food is great as is the subdued atmosphere
The specials are always first rate with the steamed musles with garlic just about heaven
The house salad is worth getting just for the secret house dressing
There's garlic and anchovies there with a special something else
A French restaurant that takes its food and service seriously while doing all it can to give the customer a relaxed and good time
A great hamburger in a French Restaurant? YES! You won't be disappointed
Great food, service and value
Owner/chef is American so he knows a good burger
These days it seems every place you eat, is the same as the next
But Loup stands out - the crowd is older (this isn't a scene - thank goodness), the wait staff is pleasant, and the service was not rushed
Its a great place to go for conversation - the volume is low and the tables are not crammed on top of one another
We both had the tuna carpaccio and raved about its taste
The salads were a little dull but the carpaccio made up for it
I took my girlfriend here for valentines day
it was a great evening
I was seated promptly, and the service was attentive

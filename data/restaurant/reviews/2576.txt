Expect bite size pieces, the way sushi is meant to be served
The green tea is phenomenal
The service, while knowledgeable, might seem cold (actually they're just extremely polite)
I'm not one to write reviews - but the food at this restaurant was so poor I feel I have to warn others
$60 for the Shell Steak for 2 - you get 7 sugarsnap pea pods, 7 carrot sticks, a lukewarm potato and 6 small slices of average beef - this was the worst meal we have had in years
The lobster bisque was oily and heavy, the escargot sunk in a watery tasteless butter-garlic substance, and the service, while friendly, was sparse and below average
Ambience? There was none - it felt like a cafateria in an retirement home
A pity that tourists to NYC end up in restaurants like this when they want a big night out on Broadway
The city has so many great restaurants to offer -just not this one
arrived at 4:30 pm
two of us
extremely slow service
left at 6:10 pm
other people who arrived later were served first
owner's son did not explain anything
when I asked about the difference between the two steaks au poivre
he said there was only one
food very good
good value
would go back, hopefully with better service
WENT BACK ON 3/18/06
FOOD WAS VERY GOOD AGAIN
FRENCH ONION SOUP TERRIFIC, STUFFED MUSHROOMS GREAT
DUCK ENTREE GREAT
DESSERTS GREAT
SERVICE AT 4:20 SLOW UNTIL5 PM BECAUSE CHRISTIAN IS TE ONLY ONE THERE UNTIL THE REST OF THE STAFF COMES IN AT 5 PM
GREAT VALUE WITH PRICE FIXED DINNERS
WOULD DEFINITELY RETURN
This place is simply amazing
As a New Yorker I feel like I can rate this place is truly a unique find
The menus are always changing and the at home feel is relayed by the staff who really attend to their guests
My only suggetion is to make it here early because tables fill up quick before shows
Imperial Theatre (Les Miserables) is right next door which is perfect for the visitor looking to do the French-theme thing
We dined here before a sat
evening show, I'm certainly glad we made reservations
The place was packed, and after eating I certainly see why
The filet mignon was excellent, as was my lobster entree
We had a four course meal for three with wine coffee for 128
00 (before tip)
An excellent meal without breaking your wallet
My only complaint was that the tables were too close for comfort
Overall, I would highly recommend!
Went here for the prix-fixe dinner before catching a show
The breast of chicken had a gelatinous sauce and was accompanied by a bland rice and green beans/carrots
Sent the burnt soupe a l'oignon back
Waiter brought white instead of red wine
Took him 15 minutes to come back with the red
My recommendation is to go to 9th Avenue for pre-theater food
More inventive and better quality
If you're looking for tasteless thai food and rude service, this is it! I was thrillingly insulted by the end of my meal, a meal that i barely realized was thai
I did finish my meal, though, which does say it is edible, if it is the last restaraunt in NYC
I was there for lunch and I thought the food would be okay
I gave it a shot
It wasn't so bad, accept that the food just seem to cater to people who didn't like thai food
Unfortunately, the food was bland and the host was a bit rude
I won't be returning
Siam Grill is a cozy little neighborhood thai restaurant run by a very friendly and polite thai couple
I'm very partial to their curries, especially the red and the massaman (although lately I've been kind of combining them by adding potatoes to the red curry)
I around the corner and order from this place all the time, and I've always been very satisfied
This is the only Thai restaurant that I'v been to in the city where fried egg is on the menu
Many Thais top off spicy dishes with a fried egg, but in many places it's not on the menu and when requested, I will either get charged $1
00 extra, or get a strange look
Plus, the food is great, and as close to authentic Thai as one can get to homemade
As a die-hard Thai cuisine fan, I have eaten at Thai restaurants all over: NYC, San Francisco, Boston, Virginia, DC, Rhode Island
but by far Olieng is among the best
The food is always fresh and balanced in flavor, and the service is fairly fast
I don't recommend going there at lunch time, or Friday nights though - these are they busy time so you might have to wait for a seat, or service
A must if you are a Thai cuisine fan
I live in the neighborhood and eat here at least twice a week
The food is incredible, affordable and always fresh
The pad thai, pad see-ew and gaeng-panang are my favorites
Also, you can tell them how hot you want to make the dishes
Also, for dessert I recommend the Mango with Sticky Rice
I also always go with the Thai Iced Tea for a drink
The place seats about 15 people
The food and service is very good
I like the best Yum Ped (Cripy duck Thai salad ), Panang curry and Curry Puff and the service is friendly :)
My wife and I have eaten at every Thai restaurant we can think of in Manhattan, and this, believe it or not, is the absolute best
We usually get delivery, and all our friends rave about it as well
By the way, the name has changed to Olieng
Super-amazing, good and spicy
My family came for lunch prior to a theatre matinee
It was not busy, but you would not have known it by the service
Service was aloof, except for one waiter who seemed to understand his profession
The food was OK, but not as enjoyable as most Brazilian places
The beef was not a prime cut and actually rather chewy
I really was looking forward to the sausage, but it did not taste flavorful at all
The bacon wrapped turkey was very good
I do not understand the $15 tip that was automatically added to a party of five
It was not a percentage, just a straight $15
Strange
There are too many options within a block or two that are much better choices
I will not go back
I used to be a regular, quality of food and service have declined so much that I just can deal with it anymore
I wonder what happened
I love brazilian food I tried to go to every brazilian restaurants in the city
This one is the worst that I've been to
The service was slow the waiter was rude
There were about 5 to 6 waiters standing chit chatting they were very inattentive
Even though I wasn't done with my food they waiter was anxious to take away my plate!! The food was average nothing special about it

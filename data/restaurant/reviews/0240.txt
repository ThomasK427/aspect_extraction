Overdone concept - between the Buddha and the DJ playing the most BORING and UNINSPIRED techno I think I've ever heard
But have to say it matched the food and the service! Nothing special here
This appears to be more of a place to be seen than to eat
There are lots better places to go in NY
Let me just start with the good
the interior is beautiful and it is very trendy and lively
we made reservations for 7 for a birthday dinner on a thursday evenning and we were not seated until 8:30 pm
They also would only serve our birthday cake with a $6
50 cutting fee per person
We ordered an impressive assortment of their dishes including their $12/ounce kobe beef
the dumplings were horrible
no different than take out chinese
their Negimaki was burnt and tough to eat
far from the tender style that japanese restaurants prepare it
their noodles were soggy and oily
and the soup was sour and difficult to serve (we had to pour our own bowls with a dinky spoon they gave us)
we also had to claw our way out of the drinking lounge area and nearly got into 2 fights with drunk patrons who were pushing us
The food is very mediocre,overpriced chinese food in small portions
Same stuff you can get in chinatown for 1/3 of the price and 2x the amount of food
The plus about this place is the decor and the young blood flowing all around
Service is horrible, made reservations and still I had to wait 45 min
Great restaurant a great atmosphere for entertaining a client taking a date
I love the bar/lounge area even though it was a bit cramped
Tao USED TO BE great, their menu USED TO be impressive, the service USED TO be professional, prompt and helpful, and the bar USED TO be a great scene
Yes, it's always been crowded and yes, you've always had to wait for a table
THIS IS NEW YORK, get used to it
But, I agree with other reviewers that the staff will try any tactics to upsell and can be very rude, the food is highly overrated, the hostesses are completely unorganized and nasty - YOU'RE A HOSTESS, CALM DOWN - and the bar has become a singles scene
Not worth the aggravation
And does anyone think that big Buddha is tacky as hell? No wonder Madonna goes downtown these days
Our group of 5 ladies literally had to argue with our waiter that 2 appetizers to share were truly enough for our first course
He kept pushing for us EACH to order an appetizer, sushi, a main dish, and desert
Their portions are large, so our group was perfectly content with a few shared apps, a main dish each, and a few shared desserts
Considering we were drinking wine the whole time as well, we were very dissatisfied with the second-class citizen treatment we received
I took my best friend here to celebrate her graduation from college
I made reservations 3+ weeks in advance and we waited 30 minutes for our table
They gave us those tacky pagers you get at Friday's
They told us to go have a drink but the bar was so packed it was impossible
The food was very good, but overpriced
A disappointment
Tao is a unique restaurant
excellent food, to-die-for desserts! Beautiful decor and trendy bar
DEFINITELY make a reservation or you will be waiting for hours
but the bar is a great place to wait for your table
Wait staff is a little confused, however its worth the wait for the outrageous food
Enjoy!
Not only was the management and service completely un-organized, they were rude and pushy
The menu was highly over priced, and the sushi was some of the worst I have ever had
The entree's were fairly good, but not for the price tag attached to them
If you are looking to go to a place to sight a celebrity, this is it
If you are looking for great food, steer clear
Very good restaurant! but very busy
I wish it was a little easier to get reservations
This is hands down the best restaurant in manhattan
I have been to Tao over ten times and the decor is unique in the former movie theater, menu is diverse, food is tasteful, and service is phenomenol! Sat at the table next to Troy Aikmen one time
The hostesses could get over themselves, after all they are hostessess and the patrons are top notch lawyers, bankers, entertainers
When I bit into that fortune cookie I thought my mouth had died and gone to heaven
The other food (especially the seafood) was also wonderful, but the desserts! Ohmygod
for a reserved table? The atmoshere is cool here but it is tough to survive the slicked back host who hands you a beeper and tells you to wait 45 minutes past your 8 pm reservation
When I walked into this restaurant I was amazed with the whole atmosphere! The lighting was just perfect and the statues that were used as decorations were outstanding! It made me feel as if I were really in an Asian world! The food was absolutly amazing! Try the glazed sea bass- trust me you have never tasted fish as good as this! Also there ice cream and devil chocolate cake was mouth watering! You will feel staisfied leaving this place forsure!
Great Food, Outstanding Service
One of the best resturants I have ever been to
I LOVED THIS PLACE!! beautiful setting, great atmosphere, good food, friendly waiters
I would totally recommend this place to anyone wanting a good dining experience
For asian food the price is a bit much, but the surroundings definitely make up for it
I chose to go here on my birthday since I'd heard so much about it
The decor was as trendy and hip as I'd expected, but the food was rather disppointing
The menu wasn't very original, and the quality of the food was average
You're definitly paying for the ambiance here, not the service or food
Unlike others, I didn't have the horrendous wait for our reserved table
totally blowed my expectation
food was amazingly good, service was prompt and welcoming
definitely deserve another visit
I have been here several times and prob
go several more, the food it great, the martini's are great, the place is so trendy
it's guaranteed a good time!!
Nine of us visted Tao's in late december on a friday and had 5:45pm reservations
We were seated very quickly and the service was phenomenal! The ambience was so chic and trendy! The Taotini is to die for and the satay of chilean sea bass was out of this world!!! This place is definitley a must! I would go back over and over again!!!
To feel fabu-licous and since it was featured in Season Four of Sex and the City, five of us hapless victims decided to check out this restaurant
Our reservation was honored promptly and service was great but the food was lackluster in taste and portions were directly opposite to the size of the golden Buddha that defined the oh so dimly lit chic ambiance
You can feel actually fabulous since you are a bit lighter after paying the hefty bill
For a better Asian meal go to the cheap and hefty portion places in Chinatown where the Buddha may sit in a small alcove but your belly will be round and happy
By the end of the night, the seven of us were fighting over who could lick the plates and eat the garnish
Otherwise, if you don't mind feeling hungry, dissatisfied, and annoyed, the ambience is kind of nice
We had a reservation and our table was waiting for us when we arrived (albeit early for pre-theater)
Our server was outstanding
incredibly attentive
He cooked our Kobe beef (to die for) and was always right there, without hovering
The appetizers were excellent
I highly recommend the sea bass
Went with a girlfriend, waited for over an hour while we had drinks, food was ok, service was terrible
Interesting decor
Reservations are ignored
tao is a great place to come in a group if you are going to sit at a table
i would suggest to make an early reservation to avoid the crowds, it can get pretty chaotic
the decor is incredible, the giant buddah is so relaxing
how did they get it in there? the lounge area is a total singles scene, jam packed with people
the chicken satay is very good
don't even start eating the wasabi peas, they are addicting
all in all, it's a fun (crowded) place with good food and drinks
just don't go and expect to be seated right away

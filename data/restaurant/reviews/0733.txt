It was ok, the waiter suggested the two of us have a carafe
That was too much so we settled for a 1/2 of a carafe
When the bill came I noticed the wine was $29
00
I felt that the waiter should have told us the price of the wine before he poured it
My dish was a little burned but my friends was very good
Other than this experiance I like the restaurant
Okay, my parents were both born in Parma, and there are things here that I thought only my family made, and dare I say, some of them are even better
From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate, the dishes at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care
Not only is the food authentic, but the staff here are practically off-the-boat, they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine
Our busboy actually knew the little village in Emiglia-Romana that my family is from! And after we ordered our food, their wine guy suggested the wine that he thought would go best with our selections, and it was surprisingly not a high-priced bottle
This diamond in the ruff is definitely worth my 10-minute walk from the 6 train
Anywhere else, the prices would be 3x as high!
In a nutshell, this is the best Italian food I have ever eaten and ranks among the best food of any genre


period
It's a small hole-in-the-wall with about three outside tables and seating available inside
We ate on a hot summer afternoon
Since we wanted to try a little of everything, we ordered from the appetizer and entree list
Every bite was exquisite
The wine list matches the food perfectly
The price doesn't reflect the quality of the food
Although it's on a par with other top cafes, the price is about 1/2 to 1/3 of other places
For example, we spent about $120 when we ate at the Union Square Cafe (excellent) but only about $45 at Perbacco
Lastly, the wait-staff are friendly and genuine
This place is a gem worth visting again and again
Great food, lovely wine, and beautiful atmosphere
I wish I could eat there every day! Even though I do not care for white wine the selection the host suggested with our fish and pork chops was divine
Also, great apps
, and dessert too
I was transported back in Italy
I'm so thrilled to have found this restaurant
I've probably been about 10 times over the past year and have always had a great experience
It's very affordable and they have a very large menu that won't dissapoint
The staff is super attentive and friendly and has great wine recomendations
They'll alway's give you the opportunity to sample a couple bottles to choose which you like best
It's very reasonably priced for the quality of the food and service
Perbacco was the perfect beginning to a lovely evening
The reviews have hit the highlights; the wine list is amazing, food was superb and the staff was extremely courteous and attentive
This will definitely go on my top 10 list of nyc restaurants!! Oh, and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a romantic evening out!!
I loved the authenticity of this place-- the entire staff was Italian
It has a similar atmosphere to Il Buco, except the prices were so much better
Remember, it's CASH ONLY- something we didn't realize until after we ordered
But the food was great, the service wonderful
I highly recommend it
Yes, the waitstaff is certainly adept at picking the perfect wine for your food
however, they're also adept at offering the priciest option without telling you
Sly business, I suppose, but I can't imagine too many of the neighbors (myself included) having the money or wanting to spend it
I'd rather save up for the **** restaurants
That said, there's really no place I've tried in New York that replicates the purity and decadence of European tastes like this place
Their ingredients are so fresh and their recipes so pure that it's impossible to find an unimpressive dish here
There are several other wine bar/small plates places on this block and around the neighborhood, but none can quite match up with Perbacco
This is my favorite spot in the East Village
The waitstaff is friendly and are masters at choosing the right bottle of wine
The food is consistently wonderful! You should really try the meat stuffed olives and the eggplant appetizer is amazing!
I took a friend here on our first date
After all sorts of research, we decided to try Perbacco and made the ABSOLUTE right choice
The food and wine were great we shared a few of the tapas, 2 bottles of wine and had plenty of room for dessert (which was great as well)
The restaurant was very cozy which made for a great first date
I highly recommend Perbacco and plan to make this an annual event!!
Italian tapas and a good selection of wines in a warm comfortable environment
Service with a smile
The food is good but not extraordinary
From 1-10 I give the food a 7
This small place hidden on the Lower East Side has a very innovative approach to an Italian meal
The tapas comprise three pages of the menu and range from $4-10
A few of them could make a meal in itself
If you feel like having an entree as well, they have wonderful homemade pastas, risotto, and a few meat/fish entrees
Add on over 20 wines by the glass (only Italian wines) and a delicious dessert menu to end the meal
In fact, there are almost too many choices, but that gives you a good reason to go back again
Innovation is hard to come by in Italian food, but this small East Village newcomer is a true innovator
Try the cheese plate with sweet vegetable jellies and toasted foccacia
The Risotto Milanese (saffron risotto fritters) is also delicious
Leave room for fantastic dessert
Italian tapas that one can share
Is there anything better?
This cozy, hip Italian cafe is a step above the others in the 'hood
Explosively fresh and well crafted food
with beautiful attention to detail
A big plus are the Italian-style tapas
small portions but smacking with flavor! And the wine
bring it on! Lovely choices
If you have room for a main course
you WON'T be disappointed
And finally, they take dessert VERY SERIOUSLY
If you have anything
you MUST have dessert! Finally, a FRIENDLY neighborhood joint that is GLAD to serve you
Thank you, Perbacco
Refreshing!
Has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events
Staff is accomodating make sure you are satified
Willling to change TV's to meet customers preference of Sporting events
Sweet Irish bartender is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face
Although I moved uptown I try to stop in as often as possible for the GREAT cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit
From what I hear they have a great game room jsut added in the basement
still have not seen it
For what it is, this place is great
A great neighborhood spot with a casual, refined, and relaxed atmosphere
Perfect place to meet for drinks before heading down to the dark corners of the east village

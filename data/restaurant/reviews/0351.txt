It was great
Pasta was really fresh and cooked perfectly
I had the braised rib for my entree and it practically melted in my mouth
It was on a bed of polenta which was inventive and delicious
And the service was kind, though the door staff needed to relax just a little bit
Overall, I had a great time
I think the demographic for the place may skew just a bit older than me, but that's fine
The raspberry martini called The Fiamma was really yummy
The seafood was great
I never had seafood seasoned with rosemary before -- I really liked it
The little black box of chocolates to bring home was a nice treat for the next day
The waiter was not so keen to our needs
The food was not so good except for their pasta
I had a great time at Fiamma
it's an aesthetically pleasing experience from the start, with a warm, low-lit ambience and a flush of murmuring conversational energy from surrounding diners that heightens the feel of intimacy that Fiamma provides
the wine list was notable, the service professionally attentive, and each course of the meal was a delight
we shared several appetizers before moving into perfectly portioned main-course, and then topped it off with espresso, a gorgeous port and amazing deserts
the sommelier went out of his way to make certain we were very happy with our wine selection, and the rest of the staff were just as generous with their attentions, while also being discreet
will most definitely return
The music was extremely too loud to have a conversation with anyone in my party (there were only 4 of us)
I felt the wine list was overlypriced, as well as the food
and the menu doesn't have much to offer in terms of selection
My meal was OK, but the portions were very skimpy
The desserts, however were very good
the service was fantastic, they were very accomodating and educated
they are in a great location and the atmosphere is very nice
the only complaints that i have are the limited menu, come on, only one salad! and the bad coat check system
it made me want to run right out of the restaurant, very chaotic! kind of left a bad taste in my mouth at the last minute
however, the food was excellent! and the desserts were fanominal!! believe it or not, i felt like the desert menu had more selection
fiamma did have nice finishing touches prvoding you with petit fours and chocolates in a box to go!
This was probably the one of the best new restaurants in the city
The service was above and beyond
We were doted upon, never rushed and always accomodated
I highly recommend a visit and am confident you will enjoy the fabulous food, relaxing ambiance and helpful staff
THIS RESTAURANT HAS A CHEF THAT HAS TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE MENU IS VERY LIMITED WITH NO SPECIALS
IN ADDITION THE SERVING SIZE IS VERY SMAILL
THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT
TRY THE RAVIOLI WITH OXTAIN AND BEEF CHEEKS
IT IS GREAT AS IS THE TRUFFLED EGGS AND THE APPERTIZERS
THE DESSERTS ESPECIALLY THE BEINETS WITH DIPPING SOURCES ARE VERY GOOD
NOW CHEF WHITE EXPAND THE MENU
I recently had dinner at Fiamma with my family and we were all pleasantly surprised
The food was wonderful and we were lucky enough to be there when truffles were in season and their truffle dishes were great
The special drinks are delicious and the restaurant itself was nicely decorated and it was a pretty hip place
I will definitely go back and it is a great place for younger people who want great atmosphere and food for a reasonable price
Judging from some of the recent (inexplicable) reviews, it appears that the 'competition' might have been posting 'reviews' on this site
Nevertheless, as someone with no connection to Fiamma, I have to say that the food, service and atmosphere are all top notch
Just do a little homework and see what the professional reviewers have said
I have eaten here twice and have had two absolutely superb meals each time
The food, wine and staff were all fantastic
Highly recommended
Bland, mediocre, oversalted food, plus indifferent, nearly incompetent service
Overpriced wine list
Pretty room ruined by overly loud music and bad ventilation
Why is this place considered a hot spot?
I thought great! fresh pasta at a cool new place but the pasta was below average and the waiters were so snotty and spoke about the food as if it was AMAZING but it WASN'T! I just don't think it's worth a trip, especially as it's not cheap
Went to dinner at Fiamma last night
Was very good food
The pasta was just right, unusual and very flavorful
The salad was extremely fresh
The room was nice and not too loud
The place didn't blow me away as my best dining experience in NYC, but I had nothing to complain out, either
i went to fiamma a few weeks ago
After all of the hype, I was actually quite disappointed
The highly recommended mushroom salad was just that - mushrooms with greens
I expected more for the $15 price tag
My entree was so over-salted that i sent it back (and I generally LOVE salt)
My boyfriend was equally underwowed
All in all, the food wasnt all that the reviews and the $200 price tag (and thats with a moderate priced wine) made it up to be
The service, however, was impeccable
Always enjoy sitting at or in the bar area
No server or busser to clean table for 20min
1 frazzled cocktail server/runner/waiting on 4 tables in the dining room
Good help is hard to find but not THAT hard
The server was overwhelmed and forgot quite a bit about us, our order, our bill
I had to ask to spend money
An equally frazzled manager was of some help and apologetic and bought a round of drinks
The food was excellent except for the tuna carpaccio
Skip it, you've had it a dozen other times elsewhere
Scallops, yes Samantha, scallops were excellent
If anything it was like being in France
we enjoyed a looonnng dinner
The appetizers were stunning, the pastas oddly lackluster
And the design of the place is odd--getting to the bathroom from the upstairs dining room involves taking an elevator down a flight, then walking down another flight
By the time you return, your date will think you've skipped out on her
Food is solid
I had the grilled octopus, dry-aged steak, and almond cake with granita for dessert
But you can get Italian food just as good for a much cheaper price
This place is graet
The drinks were great
Actually the best dirty martini around
The wine list is very good
Our server could not have been more entertaining
The food was excellent
The bill was a bit high
but thats mostly because everything looked so good that I was forced to over order
Our delicious dishes were matched with attentive service and sleek decor
The garganelli was unforgettable! Its a class act!
its an excellent restaurant and has all of the things you would expect from an up-and-coming soho gem

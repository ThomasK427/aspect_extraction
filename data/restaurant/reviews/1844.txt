She acted like I requested a kidney when I politely asked to sign the check
I'm still angry that I stuck around for the full experience
I hope this place goes out of business
Very friendly atmosphere, a great neighborhood Nolita restaurant serving wholesome somewhat-rustic food
Great place to go for an intimate, reasonably-priced meal, and tends to attract the younger, hipper 'yet' unpretentious crowds
I LOVE this place
Althought it's a bit small, it has the best food ever
All the times I've been there I've never had a problem with service or the food
Perfect place for a first date or couples who want to go someplace intimate
the food was marginally good, but the service sucks and i will never go back there again
the manager was the most hostile and unfriendly woman i've encountered in all my many dining experiences in the city
she doesn't know the basics of customer service
The Scene Opposite an exposed-brick wall painted a lurid red hangs a painting of a lobster with a death grip on a fish
If you can stomach the vivid decor, there's little to complain about in this intimate and unpretentious Soho spot teeming with movie-star regulars, off-duty chefs and neighborhood Joes
At the teensy bar, a hip, lively and good-looking crowd chats with bartenders who are not beyond bringing in a television for the World Series
The Food This isn't your mama's comfort food: Expect to see foie gras, roast pigeon and beef marrow marmalade on the menu
Start with plump grilled octopus, crispy fried oysters or surprisingly juicy tofu-seaweed salad, rather than too-sweet barbecued ribs
Blush-pink duck breast and crunchy fried chicken--a house specialty--are both great choices
A strawberry sundae or the slightly bitter, very moist chocolate Bruno are both rewarding
I went with a party of 6, so I got to try a little bit of everything
Appetizers and entrees were all excellent; I truly cannot say I disliked anything
Service was amazing, they were considerate, attentive, friendly, prompt, and accurate
I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience here
This restaurant has quickly become our late night favorite, even though we live way uptown from it
The bone marrow and oxtail marmalade is wonderful, and I have yet to try a dish I didn't like
The kitchen is open late, and though you'll probably have to wait a while for a table, cocktails and the raw bar are available to help you pass the time
The staff is very friendly and always gives us impeccable service
I highy recommend it!
The food is truly unique and delicious
The highlights include the bone marrow marmalade on crostini, the fresh oysters and their succulent hanger steak
However, the cheese fondue had too much wine and not enough cheese, the escargot was too stewy and the salmon was very average
Service was attentive and prompt, however the wait is incredibly long
I've never waited for a table for so long! Reservations for parties under 5 people isn't allowed but their yummy cocktails and handsome waiters help soothe the pain
This is quite a chic and trendy chef hangout; I met the Iron Chef Morimoto when I was there
Overall, it's pretty average and I don't think it's worth the wait without reservations
Go earlier for easier seating if you can
after all the rave reviews, we were really excited to try this place
unfortunately, the setting made us turn around and go down the block
the music (generic thumping house) was too loud to have a conversation without yelling, and the tables are practically on top of each other -- making for cramped quarters
maybe we'll come back earlier in the evening when the place isn't packed to the rafters b/c it sounds like the food is incredible
HAD AN INTERESTING LATE DINNER LAST NIGHT ,THE FOOD WAS OUTSTANDING, STARTED W/ROAST DUCK SOUP, AND HAD TO TRY THE FRIED CHICKEN, (IT WAS ALL THAT WAS PROMISED, MY DATE HAD THE ESCARGOT, AND A LOBSTER DISH , AND WE FINISHED WITH A BANANA SPLIT, WOW! HIGHLY RECOMMEND EARLY OR LATE TO MY FELLOW FOODIES
We live in the neighborhood and in the 4+ years we've lived here - Blue Ribbon is always a win-win option
Yes - if it's busy - do expect to wait
but the bar is good in fact we love just hanging out with the bartenders there so it's really not a 'wait' in the typical sense
Food is always reliable and good, in our years of going there we've only had one bad dish
And - most importantly - our host and waiter immediately took care of us
Best bet is either go early [ pre 7pm ] or go late late am
The menu at Blue Ribbon is very different from any restaurant I've ever been to
With the menu ranging from items such as foie gras to hamburgers, there's something for everyone here
Since I Blue Ribbon does not take reservations for my small parties, we did have to wait a little bit, but it was well worth it
This place is pretty damn good
You'll have to wait a bit any given nite (40 mins for a Tuesday nite dinner at 8:45) but it's worth it
The onion soup and faus gior (i can't spell it) were very tastey
The rack of lamb cooked exactly the way you wanted it
The amtosphere is that of a first date type place with girls on the one side of the tables and guys facing the wall
as it should be
But the place was a little clever knowing that guys would face the wall and strategically placed mirrors so all you guys on bad dates can look around
Everyone was friendly and nice
They don't rush you out of the restruant and won't bring the check until asked for
Nothing bad about this place, while you wait try the raw bar or some tastey foreign beers they have on tap
This was an excellent restaurant choice for a relaxed couple who doesn't mind sitting at the bar for a bit and who enjoys delicious food
The fried chicken dish is expensive but fabulous, and a chance of pace from the usual American fare
The striped bass was fantastically prepared, and the wine was reasonable and excellent
The service was attentive and relaxed, and although a very small restaurant, it felt cozy and intimate
A good date place and definitely great for a small group of 4 or 5
After being told by a close friend that this was hands-down her favorite restaurant, I invited two collegues to dinner
The restaurant is tiny and doesn't take reservations
When they say the wait is an hour, expect to wait an hour and a half! However, a few glasses of wine at the bar took the edge off and once we were sat, we were abe to dive into a variety of treats: raw oysters and goat cheese salad
Our waiter brought the wrong dinner for me (shrimp provencal instead of the salmon) but then comped my meal with no question
The skate was delicious as well
Although I wasn't blown away by my first visit to Blue Ribbon, their hospitality and the lovely atmosphere will definitely bring me back
great big cheeseburger on nice bun with fresh lettuce and tomato and crisp french fries
Flame broiled taste
Eat it at the bar and wash it down with a sierra nevada on tap
Ask the bartender Will to have a drink with you and tell you about his band
Great place to go when it's not packed
I took my parents here expecting the food to be so great
The meal took forever, and the service was so bad
Not only did we have to flag the waiter down every time for every course or request, but they spilled our drinks twice all over the table - and once was hot tea
They also were dropping plates and banging things in the kitchen all night, it was so loud and there was never an apology
I had the chicken breast and it was terrible and the much-touted matzoh ball soup was mediocre at best
Don't need to go back!
A group of us went to this restaurant on internet recommendations
We were highly disappointed
The portions were quite small
My friend ordered a steak rare, and it came out medium well
The french fries tasted like they were sitting out for hours
The kicker is that we ate our meal at 7 pm, expecting the cooks to be on their game at that hour
The host was excessively rude
We had a reservation for 6:30 and arrived at 6:15
The host had already canceled our reservation without even giving us a phone call
He stated we were lucky to be served even though the restaurant was completely empty when we arrived
I definitely would avoid this place for dinner, but I heard that it serves after-bar hours
I guess that would be the only reason I would return do to a lack of other options
the brunch is tops, the service is wonderful, but the prices are downright expensive
look to bring the card with the most limit and be prepared to spend it
the other night i had a few drinks, 2 dozen oysters and 2 appetizers and it came out to over a hundred
for a full meal (as i've had before) expect a hundred a person easily
the brunch however is easier on your wallet and you'll leave a happy (full) camper
I love this restaurant

It was my first time trying sushi and I really enjoyed it!
I come to this restaurant for 4 reasons:   1
Kobe Beef appetizer 2
Spicy crab Pizza 3
Genuinely nice staff: bartenders, waitresses, chef and management, not the hostesses

Location  This place is truly a gem
I just hope it survives its own success and doesn't fall victim to the plight of other lesser known restaurants that became VERY popular and then went downhill
Also, wish they opened for lunch a little earlier
Great place
Worst service EVER! Waiter was awful, harrassing/bullying us to order what he recommended (or rather, INSISTED)
He tried to coerce us into ordering an expensive sampling menu; when we declined, he just wouldn't back down, repeatedly barking out that it would never be enough
We stood our ground, telling him we'd order this for now and play it by ear
More than attentive in bullying us BEFORE we ordered, he NEVER returned during the meal to check on ourtable! Our drink glasses sat empty with no offer to refresh them; we would've ordered more sushi rolls
if he'd only cared to stop by
We talked to the manager, who so politlely did NOTHING, saying that waiter was one of his best
I shudder to think of his worst! The cool ambiencegreat sushi were just NOT ENOUGH to turn the experience around
Ono will NEVER serve us again
I have been living in NY and going to restaurants here all my life
ONO was THE worst restaurant experience
The food is way over seasoned and really bad
The service is terrible
The waitstaff is nice but there aren't enough of them and they cant be as attentive as they should be
It's SO overpriced for what you get
If I'm going to pay $5 for a coke or $15 for a glass of house wine, it better be next to a plate of really good food and this just doesn't cut it ONO is Definetly a NO NO
And if you are going with a large group, FORGET it, they charge some sort of banquet charge on top of the service fee
They don't ask you how you want certain foods cooked, they just bring it all out and they don't pay enough attention to a big table
I never write these kind or reviews, but ONO was so bad, it is a complete NONO
Rude and careless service It started with the hostess who was very unfriendly and unaccommodating, which for a hostess should translate to rude and unprofessional
Then the bar tender gave me a hard time about a drink I hadn't picked up from the bar right away
The waitress was slow and forgot drinks and food we ordered
Worst Japanese Food The rib eye we had was full of fat and my friends and I didn't even touch the fish which looked dry and burned
Overpriced The check came out to 70 USD per person without drinks
Recommendation: Avoid This is my single worst restaurant experience I have ever had in NYC
My friends and I strongly recommend to avoid this place by any means
What a waste of time and money
The service was horrible; slow and incorrect almost every time
The food was good, but not for what we paid
We even spoke with the manager about our experience and he was rude
I've eaten at so many other sushi places in NYC, I would never recommend this one
The food itself was of good quality, but highly overpriced
The ambiance was nice except for the bright standing lights (upstairs) and the blowing A/C
Our waitress was friendly, but had to attend far to many tables to keep the service at a level that you would expect
We received orders that were not intended for us three times and there was a huge gap between the entrees
Nice evening (apart from some service aspects) but not a good value for the money
The restaurant itself is beautiful and the upstairs restroom holds a funny surprise
The food was fresh and flavorful, but didn't knock my socks off with the exception of the eel nigiri, which were wonderful
the food is overpriced, totally not worth your money
we ordered the kobe beef robata, it was horrible
i have never tasted kobe beef so rough and tough
it tasted more like regular beef with a huge price tag
the sake was very good, but the sushi was unbelow average
considering the prices that they charged, i was very disappointed
I went there to celebrate my boyfriend's b-day and I had the worst experience in a NY restaurant ever
The waiter was constantly puching us to have drinks, he told us that we were not ordering properly and insisted on bringing to the table his recommendations
We told him we only wanted some sushi and some barbeque items
He brought average sushi (actually the toro was unedible, too chewy) and we ended up leaving about 1/3 of the sushi pieces he brought because they were not good
We did not have any drinks, only water, and the bill for two people (two appetizers, three small barbeque skewers and an average sushi platter) came to over $250

I won't be back
The food was not good and the service just wants to overcharge you
Never again
Located in the Hotel Gansevoort this restaurant lives up to what one would expect of a restaurant in this ultra trendy hotel
Sushi is excellent and decently portioned, other food is decently priced
There is very little other than seafood so you have to be a true sushi lover to enjoy the food
Service was attentive but I felt lacking
While I was dining on a weekday there were numerous parties of 10+ obviously dining on expense accounts
While service was standard our waitress didn't stop by to ask how our food was or bother with us pretty much after our food was ordered
I wouldn't say service was bad but definately not up to elegant dining standards
I understand the need to fully cater to a big party but I don't believe everyone else in the restaurant should be ignored
The jury is still out
if you look for trendy Japanese restaurant, this is it! Food is great, interior decor is beautiful
price is very reasonable
Service needs improvement
Overall is excellent
My girlfriend and I walked in here on a whim on our way to the subway and stayed for 3 hours
The bar was uber-cozy - well lit and very stylish
Check out the little room with the red seats and candles and get a green dragon saketini - it's worth the NYC cocktail price ($14)
After relaxing in the bar we decided to move inside and have some food
The rolls were very good and the kobe appetizers were delicious
The staff was great personable, polite and very attentive
Granted, it was a sunday night but we were seated immediately and not rushed at any part of the night
Overall, I highly recommend both the bar and restaurant
I just wish that I had been able to get a room at the hotel as well that night
maybe next time
Highly recommended
Stopped in on Thursday night @7:30pm with reservations
Promptly seated on the upper level after walking through the restaurant to get up the stairs
Highly impressed with the ambience, music and crowd there
We order a whole slew of small dishes to share in lieu of the large entree plates
Each dish brought out was delicious and beautifully presented
I was very impressed
Only drawback was the server that we had, who pushed us several times to order a large plate which i suppose would have pushed up the tab by $30-50
But we were already full, so this was a major turn off
Overall, prices are acceptable for what you get, and I will be back again with my girlfriends for a trendy girls' night out soon
went on a thursday evening around 1030ish
we were seated promptly and were offered complimentary coat check
food was excellent, as was the atmosphere
they have a nice variety of foods, and unique dishes
food was average priced for a japanese restaurant in new york city

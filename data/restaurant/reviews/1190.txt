I had dinner here a few nights ago and what a disaster
The service was horrible and very rude
The food was so pricey and I left starving
The menu is VERY limited
Not many options to choose from
The owners must know some journalists giving them good reviews b/c this place stinks
I live in the neighborhood and watched this place go up
One NY Times Reporter claimed that the owners did all the work themselves
I know this is not true as I saw many Asian men working in there
Little Giant does not belong on the LES!!!  Save your money- unless you like paying for attitude!
superb food, great friendly welcoming service
can't ask for a better place to enjoy a meal
I have been here half a dozen times and am still making bookings to go back!
beware - I was supposed to have my birthday dinner here and the reservation was canceled by the owners the night before! I think they really wanted to turn over the tables rather than honoring a reservation that they'd accepted
I'm sure in time, they will learn better business ethics, but for now, no matter matter how good or bad the food I'm taking my business elsewhere and I suggest you do too
Service was lacking and food took way too long to arrive
Waiting for the drinks to come was also a disappointment because they were horrible
Sent my drink back and got back an even worse drink
I would stick with the wine next time
When the food did come it was a suprise
The goose was excellent and so was the pork
But I will not be back as there are other restaurants that offer better service and drinks
Don't miss the chicken liver mousse, the homemade sausages
Eclectic wine list with affordable selections
the room is sexy, lively, tons of windows, and the vibe is cool and homey
I was excited to check this place out, but disappointed when we arrived
We dined here on a Tuesday night around 8pm w/o a reservation
There are about 10 tables total in the place, but it still manages to be very unromantic
It looks like someone's open space apt that was only slightly converted to facilitate a restaurant
You can tell little thought went into the aesthetic and ambiance of the space so it is decidedly boring and unappealing
You have a full view of the teeny kitchen area from each table in the place
On the upside, although the menu has few dishes to choose from and most of them are meat selections, the food is well prepared and flavorful
Although for me, there are too many other great places in the neighborhood to come back to this one
The food and decor at this little restaurant are both great
Even though it's located in one of the trendiest areas of Manhattan, the staff is super-friendly and low key
Most of the clientelle is in their 20's-30's, but this is also a nice spot to take the parents to if they're in the neighborhood
I was here for dinner not to long ago
The people are pretentious and rude
The food was cold- the drinks are pricey
In Short The former Caf Lebowitz space has been reborn as an American bistro, serving comfort food favorites like roast chicken; grilled hangar steak; hamburgers on brioche buns; chicken, avocado and bacon sandwiches, and more
Brunch will be served daily and features chocolate chip and lemon-poppy seed pancakes, assorted omelettes, eggs Florentine, and tuna Nicoise salad
Among the signature cocktails are mint lemon drops and a "rum ginger," with rum and fresh pineapple and ginger
A couple girlfriends and I went there for dinner and cocktails on a Saturday night
Our food and service was great! The place was packed but this did not change our service
Our waiter was hot and very pleasent, and absolute must!!! Highly Recommended
I was visiting NY (from Los Angeles) for my Birthday last year, and my friends and I stumbled into Barmarche
We were seated quickly, though the restaurant is quaintly and comfortably small
The atmosphere is very pleasant with ambiant lighting, great for a date
Waiters are friendly and informative, and when our food arrived (fairly quickly), it was amazingly good! Do try the Crab Cake! Though it was a little pricey for the size, it is worth it! The main courses are really yummy, and the mojitos are great! We had such a nice experience that we met more friends there for dinner the following night, greeted with more great food! The owners were also working both nights and very friendly to the customers
It's probably more of an adult or older child atmosphere and not so much for toddlers, however
Have been to Barmarche for brunch, lunch and drinks and have always been extremely impressed with the atmosphere, the service, the food and the value
The drinks and friendliness of the bartends are also a draw
This place is a gem in the Nolita area - no pretensions, just a great place to hang with friends or have drink with a date
The place is absolutely adorable!
my boyfriend and I got there around 4pm on Saturday for a late lunch and we got seated right away but after we ordered, it seemed like they forgot about us
we waited for about 40mins until we decided we were going to leave since the waiter never came back to ck on us
the very nice manager came right over, apologized and comp'd our meal for us which finally came out 10mins later
the French onion was quite tasty but a bit sweet, I enjoyed my shrimp and avocado salad (wished it had more shrimp tho), and my boyfriends pulled pork sandwich was great
the manager was really nice, did the right thing, and even sent over free mimosas for us
despite the waiter forgetting us, Id still go back bc the manager was really cool and the food was good
maybe we went on an off day?
I recently went for brunch (remember to be there before noon on Sundays!), and wa surprised that they did not toast the English Muffin for the eggs benedict
I would think that they would have come toasted
sent them back and they toasted them in a jiffy! I think it ought to be an option (in my opinion)
First, they sat us right beside the window where the temperature was 10 degrees warmer than outside (20)
Then, dinner did not at all meet expectations
The starter (mushrooms with pecorino on pita bread) was nothing sensational but good, still: you CAN toast the bread, so not everything is softish pillowy
The main dish, salmon, artichoke, spinach tomato sauce was a disappointment
There ARE other ingredients than pepper
And not to have the slightest lemon dash with artichokes and no sweet hint with the tomatoes is a crime
While the salmon was salty but okay, I wondered how long you have to cook spinach until it loses all its taste
And if people do not have the dignitity to invite us to tea while we were sitting in the cold, with OUR JACKETS ON, but charge 7$ for it, you should not be surprised about a tiny tip
I recently dined at Barmarch with a large group of people for a friend's birthday and we all loved the food ambiance
The steak was out of this world as was the well versed wine list
We will surely be going back soon!
My boyfriend and I went to Barmarche for a 3 course pre fixe Valentine's Day dinner
We were seated in a comfy corner table for 5, just for the two of us
The ambience was very romantic, roses and candlelight everywhere
I loved the decor, very warm and cozy
We had a delicious 3 courses-- the sirloin steak and fries were amazing, and the shared chocolate fondue dessert with a glass of champagne was quite yummy and perfect for Valentine's Day
The dinner was completed with the sweetest gift from the restaurant, a clear plastic heart decorated container filled with chocolates and candy
The service was mostly very good, although a little spotty, but it was a busy night
We felt warm and welcome in the restaurant
I would come back any day and plan to soon
Very cool feel and beautiful, down to earth people
had brunch next to an Entourage Leading Lady and a real Scrub last summer
Recently spent a lovely Sunday evening there with live jazz band
great atmosphere for a group of friends
ask for the back table
so cute food was pretty decent, but it's more the kind of place you go to hang out than to eat good food
drinks were good and the waitresss was really sweet! recommended
Went with 3 others for Sunday brunch around 1pm
Was mobbed but maitre 'd was polite and in control
25 to 30 minute wait turned into 40 mins, but we were allowed to scope out our table before being seated, then received an even better table (maybe as consolation for long wait?)
The food was delicious
My red pepper/feta/caramelized onion omlette was phenomenal (though small-ish in size) as were the homefries
Other dishes we had included a cheeseburger with tasty garlic fries and a tuna burger with wasabi mayo and fries (yum!)
Reasonably priced (omlette was $8) but a bloody mary, though fantastic, was an overpriced $10 (especially when it's offered free elsewhere with similarly priced prix fixe brunch)
Perfect to bring out of towners or recover with friends from a raucous Saturday night
Service was pretty good, but not astounding

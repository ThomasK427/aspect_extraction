There are others with similar names, but only on Sushi a Go-Go
The rolls they served me looked like they were made yesterday
The steak teriaki was dry
I have gone here a few times and I think i can find a better sushi restaurant in the area
the restaurant is cute but the food is SUB PAR
my miso soup is always luke warm!
My friends and I recently had a great time at Sushi A Go Go
This is not typical sushi -- even though I like typical sushi just fine
The food at Sushi A Go Go is wonderful
The chef has a varied menu and it is ALL good
You won't find this anywhere else
I especially recommend the rolls
The service is prompt and courteous, and the check won't bankrupt you
I've been a regular customer of Sushi-A-GoGo for a few years
The food has it's own twist and I appreciate it
If you're open minded about the term sushi then you'll love it
The disturbing thing - tonight I watched as the manager of the restaurant scolded one of his waitresses in front of all of the customers in such a harsh way to the point that the poor girl was in tears
I've seen this manager treat people badly before and is very stoic to customers, but this was bad
I think that is a major reason why I always feel a weird energy there, which makes it a weird dining experience
I really love the food
The crispy lobster roll with mango sauce is just right
I'm going delivery
That manager has a major problem and I don't think I want to be around a guy like that
We went to Sushi a Go Go with 40 minutes to spare before our show started
(We made it to our show with time to spare
) There was a line to get in, but it moved fast
We were seated pretty quickly and the service was great, as was the sushi, which we found to be very fresh
The california rolls in particular were great, not your typical recipe
The '60's decor is adorable
We will definitely go back again
My girlfriend and I went there before the opera
It was fast and friendly
We had a great time
I definitely recommend the sake sangria
If you want sushi and you are on the upper west side, don't even waste your time trying this place
There was hardly any fish in my roll and on top of having no fish, it wasn't rolled correctly
The prices are absurd for the quality
As far as service goes, the waiter was fine but the waterboy spilled water all over my boyfriend's leather jacket and all over a girl's Louis Vuitton bag
The management didn't offer to comp either of our bills
All in all, this experience was negative and we will never go back! Try Ivy's on west 72nd or Planet Sushi on Amsterdam
My husband and I go regularly to Sushi a go-go and we've taken friends from out of town and have always had a wonderful time
The sushi is just superb
The space is small, but the mod decor really perks it up
This is great food
nuff said
Incredibly over-priced menu
The service was good, even though the place was packed within 15 minutes of my arrival
The food is great but cost twice as much as any normal Japanese resturant
If you want to eat at the trendiest sushi place with the cutest waitstaff, this is the place
Other wise save your money and go to a Japanese restuatrant down the street
Despite the institutional design we were pleasantly surprised by the food
The service was another story
It began when the waiter broke a glass of red wine and I ended up with wine and glass shards in my lap
This was followed by another diner getting smacked in the head with a plate as we were being served
As if that wasnt enough, after another in the group mentioned that a portion of the sushi on her plate was not what she had ordered, the waiter came back with chopsticks and started to remove it (as she was eating!) We were very understanding and tried to make the most of the night but were surprised that no one offered to make good
(No dry cleaning, no bill adjustment)
All that was offered was a replacement for the glass of wine
Regardless of the good food, I cannot recommend this place
Don't let the outside appearance fool you - their sushi is the best! They have so many different kinds (I love the white tuna!) and the service is good
It's hidden on a quieter street by the Time Warner Center but you should definitely try it if you like good, quality sushi
My sushi experience here was very positive
Our waiter was very helpful
A little crowded since it was a Friday night but lively to put it nicely
The fish was very fresh--definitely higher quality than most stuff you find in lower Manhattan
Decor was modern minimalist, not your average traditional Japanese sushi house
It was refreshing to meet a sushi chef who actually spoke Japanese
The special rolls were delicious
I would return to this restaurant
This is not a restaurant I will go out of my way to eat at, but I certainly enjoyed my meal there
The decor is sparse and elegant, the service warm (though my waitress was occasionally difficult to find), and the sushi fresh
The superb eel more than made up for the watery green tea, and they were kind enough to give me complimentary ice cream for having me change tables early on to accomodate a large party
If I happened to be in the Columbus Circle neighborhood around dinnertime, I would definitely go back
The decor is what initially got me in the door
It is so nice and clean and bright, unlike most inexpensive Indian restaurants
Definitely my favorite on the UWS and I have tried 8 or 10 others
The food is quite good
I like the saag and the chicken makhani
Excellent prices and big portions
I always take my whole family here when they visit
Ironically, the best waiter in this Indian Restaurant is a Sri Lankan named Rodney
Great service matches excellent saag paneer and chicken vindaloo
The yogurt shakes are tasty and the orange decor is pleasing to the eye
Great buy and probably the best Indian cuisine in that neighborhood
Fresh ingredients and homemade soups impart a comfy warmth to the work day
Only drawback is pre-set sandwich menu
Overall Great Lunch Choice
Clean environment
Decent Salad Bar
Plenty of Sweets
I have been going to Toasties for a few years now
When they first opened their prices were less and they included a soda and chips
Now the price is higher and does not include either
However, it is hard to find good places to eat in the wall street area
I still go here because their food is still very good
Word of advice
It gets crowded during peak lunch hours but if you wait to long some of the prepared food is gone
My fiance and I accidentally found Turkuaz while walking up Broadway last spring
We fell in love with the place instantly and have gone back a few time since then
So when we decided to have a pre-nuptial celebration dinner, we naturally chose Tuarkuaz and we could not have been more satisfied
The manager (Hkan) was great in helping pick a menu within our budget and gave us a prix fix menu that had a variety of entrees, unlimited appetizer and the most delicious dessert I have had in a long time

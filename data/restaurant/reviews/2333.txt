After you are full you can dance the night away
The downstairs lounge: the jazz musicians were great as were the drinks, especially the watermelon martini, and the seats were quite comfortable (always a welcoming addition to a bar)
It was fairly smoke filled, which could cause a problem for some people, but my biggest complaint was that the service was particularly slow
The restaurant: the salmon and the lobster ravioli were quite delicious and the service was polite friendly
This place could never qualify as a neigborhood hangout
Its overpriced the food is mediocre and it just plain reeks of corporate management
I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE FOR OVER 2 YRS
I HAVE BEEN A PROUD PATRON OF MERCHANTS FOR OVER 5 YRS (I HAVE BEEN TO ALL OF THEIR LOCATIONS AND NOT ONCE HAVE I BEEN DISAPPOINTED)
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE PREVIOUS REVIEW MEANT
THIS PLACE IS WONDERFUL SERVICE (FRIENDLY AND NOT RUDE), FANTASTIC AND DELICOUS FOOD, GREAT PRICES AND PERFECT SETTING TO FIT ANYONE'S MOOD
THIS IS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES TO HANG OUT IN NY
ESPECIALLY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD
I WOULD SUGGEST THIS TO EVERYONE, EXCEPT THOSE WHO HAVE NO TASTE, CLASS OR STYLE
I ate here last night with my family, and it was great
The service was attentive and the portion sizes were perfect (on the larger side)
The stuffed mushrooms were a great app (1 order per person!) and the Agnolotti was tasty and abundant
Their tomato sauce is fantastic
I would definitely go out of my way to go there aganin
My wife I have been eating at Il Vagabondo's since the late sixties
We grew up with 1st
generation Italian cooking(like home) we always received great food, great service, great value
Most time's the great chefs give us advice as to wher to get this spice or that cheese
We really feel like we are invited to somebody's home for dinner
The Veal is usually great the pasta is super
Go spend a couple of hundred more at the hotsie totsie joints
you can't get better

Il Vagabondo is a rare gem
I recommend it to any friends who'll be in NY
The staff make the difference - no menu needed, great service a knack for making us feel at home
Plus the opportunity to play bocce! Even though we're not regulars, this restaurant is a must whenever returning home
I've ate at Il Vagabondo several times, and each time gets better
There is a certain nostalgia when eating there
I sit next to the bocci ball court everytime, I love it
I always feel like its somewhere Michael Coleone would eat
The Chicken Parm is a must-try, its some of the best I've ever had
Went here on a recommendation from a regular and enjoyed it
They were friendly and the food was very good
We had chicken parm and eggplant parm, green salads, calamari, and sides of pasta
Good food, good prices
The waiter recommended a nice moderately priced wine and we loved it
He kept calling us bella! Anyway, we were seated in the casual area (we went there after a Yankees game so we were wearing sneakers, shorts) right next to the bocci court but Charlie the maitre'd showed us the rest of the place too
We will definitely go back
I had a wonderful meal at Il Vagabondo
I went with the very simple spaghetti and meatballs, and they were of the best I've had! Went with a group of 6 and we all had a great experience
The service is attentive without being pesky
The waiters and hosts make you feel as if you are a regular
We had a very memorable dinner and will be returning to this restaurant
also the veal parmesean was great
best gnocchi i've had
not a great atmosphere, but the food made up for it
worth the money, as we had lots of leftovers
Go on Wednesdays or Saturdays when the have the Veal Osso Bucco
It's THE BEST
Also the gnocchi with bolognese sauce can't be beat
Can be noisey and service is sometimes not Great but always acceptable
A little bit of Italy right here in NYC! It felt like we were at a small local restaurant in Italy
The atmosphere is interesting to say the least
The bocci (sp) courts inside the restaurant add something I've never seen before
The food is excellent, made to order, service was great
The food was traditional, delicious Italian food
The Bocce Ball dessert was tasty and fun
Everyone should try it at least once
A scrumptous, chocolate covered ice cream ball
There was something very clandestine and romantic about the lighting and small tables next to the bocce ball court
The light sound of bocce balls hitting together and the low key conversation made for a very comfortable dining experience
The service was professional and courteous
Ever hear about that line about Middle Eastern hospitality? It's true, here at Sultan
All the wait staff is attentive to every single detail
The food is absolutely amazing and the portions are nowhere near stingy, outright generous
The manager makes you feel as if you're at home
It's a gem
An absolute gem
The food is unreal, the service is beyond stellar, it's one of my favorite restaurants in NYC
The GM attends to every detail
The Scene If you're from the Upper East Side, you'll probaby run into your neighbor from the co-op here
The dining room is full of celebrating families and couples double dating
A low ceiling, crooning piano player, and dim lights profer coziness
After all, it's just a neighborhood restaurant at heart, though one with limousines outside from a few blocks over
The Food The menu is vast
Some dishes, like the spaghetti puttanesca and rigatoni amatriciana, are reliable, if not a bit underwhelming with their unimaginative sauces
The best bet is to order carnivorously
The veal chop, touted as the "Best in New York" on the menu, is close--it's grilled to perfection
Veal ossobucco is tangy with meat that falls from the bone
Be sure to order a side dish--the garlicky broccoli rabe is a great choice
Desserts are all homemade, and the usual suspects--tiramisu, a napoleon, cheesecake--are all reliable
From the minute we arrived it was a fantastic evening, the waitstaff were so nice and accomodating and there was even a man working downstairs at the bathroom doors to open them for the customers and offer toiletries
CLASSY!
The food from the entrees to the cakes for dessert were great
It was a great friendly and cozy atmosphere and well worth the NYC prices
I highly recommend and can't wait to return with my family again
Food was great service was good definitely would go back again!!
I have been told to go here for years
I wasn't overly impressed with the food or the ambiance
However, the service is impeccable and that made it worthwhile
We went there for my boyfriends birthday, after walking past about a zillion times, due to living just around the corner, always commenting how we must go there, it's always packed with smart looking people! After an excellent martini at the bar we were seated and antipasti immediately placed in front of us, yummy! There are lots of specials aswell as an extensive menu, our waiter was charming and very helpful
I had grilled lemon sole with the most amazing creamed spinach I think I have ever eaten, my boyfriend had the veal and relished every mouth full! The wine was great, the tiramisu (with birthday candle) was tremendious! It's not cheap but you do feel special eating in there and it's Italian food as it should be, simple but full of flavour
We were extremely disappointed by their inferior food and rude and disgraceful service
My 5 clients/guests actually commented about the horrible, unprofessional behavior of the waiter and manager
Even the bartender was rude! To make matters worse: The wine list was terrible and then

We highly recommend it!
I just love this place
Tucked away below street level on West 10th Street in the Villlage, The service in this cozy spot is friendly, the ambiance relaxed, the music oddly Cuban, and the food - absolutely delicious
Try the salata di patate and the Bolognese sauce
I have been a loyal fan of this restaurant for more than ten years
I have celebrated many special events and have sent friends as well as strangers off of the street here for the charm and wonderfully unique food
The specials menu is usually as extensive as the regular, more traditional menu
It is always difficult to choose whether to go with an old standby, or a new and inventive dish
I am NEVER disappointed
Tonight my partner and I decided to have our Valentine's Dinner here and we were not the only ones that had the same romantic idea
My only fear in writing this is that I have always thought of Tanti Baci as a well kept West Village secret, but tonight I just can't keep it to myself!
well my husband and I had a crappy day all around, everything was going wrong, from driving into the city, finding parking, and suffering from hypoglycemia
We got to the restaurant and it was a small cute place in a basement
the service was slow, but well compensated by the delicious food, and our waitress who made our time well worth it
the place is romantic and exciting, the music had a latin feel to it
which i found really enhanced the ambience
if you like good food, and dont mind feeling a little cramped this is a good place to go, and can order the works without feeling too bad about the tab
oh by the way the house wine by the bottle was like 23 bucks from australia
it was delicious
Its worth it to go just to hang out w/ the staff, the well portioned, well prepared food from the hand-authored authentic menu is an added bonus
I was there last night with a group of 8
evrery single dish was perfect
We had a great waiter and great service and i just can't say enough about the place! It is small and cramped but what a great opportunity to get to know someone who you will never see again
Thank you Tanti Baci! We loved it!
I come from a southern Italian Family and have ALWAYS been disappointed when I've eaten at Italian restuarants
But then Tanti Baci entered my exisitence
I had the GREATEST MEAL THAT I'VE EVER HAD (Aside from my Grandmothers) The food is quite traditional Italian and at same time excelent The food is SO flavorful that you have to wait about 3 to 5 minutes after every bite to fully get the flavor and depth of the food
What else can I say? Its other-worldly!
I met a friend for diner here last week and I can't get the food out of my mind
The bread they give you when you're seated is so fresh and has some sort of pizza-like flavoring that is delicious
I ordered the wild mushroom risotto and it was amazing
Definitely going back!
I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical as walked down the stairs into but was pleasantly surprised by the cozy atmosphere
I was there on a Tuesday night so it wasn't crowed and found our waitress very helpful suggesting some entrees
I went with a shrimp asparagus ravioli which was amazing along with scrumptious tiramisu
My boyfriend and I also went here for Valentine's day and had a totally different, great experience
It was cozy and there was one waiter, but it was not overly crowded or slow -- much worse can be easily found on Valentine's day, are you kidding? We were smitten with the flower room, it's antique mirrors and lights and the volume wasn't too loud to talk quietly
Our raviolli was fantastic as was the bottle of red (one of the cheapest on the menu), and the tiramisu was the best I have ever had
Having caught a glance at the downstairs area before we were seated, seeing how dark and cramped it looked, we were thrilled to be seated around the corner and would love to go back on a normal weeknight
Also, in the summer, it's the place on 7th that has the cutest little tables and tealights outside
My boyfriend and I went here for Valentine's Day and were seated in the Flower Room - around the block
The restaurant was cozy if not extremely cramped
We felt like we were sharing a table with the couple next to us
There was 1 waiter for the entire room, so service left something to be desired
Anyway, we ordered from an extremely limited and overpriced menu
Both of our entrees were cold, and my Lobster and Scallop Ravioli left me wondering where the seafood was
I would not go back here, especially for a holiday, and I wonder how CitySearch rated this a great holiday restuarant
Just went there last night on a recommendation and it lived up to everything that has been said about it
In a basement in the Village you wouldnt no it existed if you werent looking for it
Great ambiance, great food, great service
One of the best restaurants in the city
Situated in a basement in the West Village, Tanti Baci is the perfect location for quite dinners for two, or a small group
Exposed brick and dim lighting create a respectful privacy between what would otherwise be closely seated guests
The whole experience is excellent: my boyfriend and I went there for an intimate dinner, and found the pasta al dente, the pesto flavorful and the server knowledgeable about the wine
In fact, I remember drinking a terrific house red
From the familiar greetings of incoming patrons, we determined that regulars frequent the place -- and for good reason! I highly recommend!
I really liked this restaurant, the food was really good and they have the BEST fried calamari I have ever tasted!!!
i loved this place! my boyfriend and i just walked in as we were passing by and we loved it
the space is a little small but that's the charm about it
food was great!
I realize that some people hate this and other overly accliam it as the best italian - you are both wrong
For those of you checking it out expecting itto be 5 star look at the prices they should be an indication
I personally love this place (maybe not so much in the summer as its in the basement) but to get to the point its a LOCAL village restaurant cheap and cheerful and it delivers that's it purpose not gourmet
I like it just because of that everyone else - you are right go to the other italians in the village and leave this palce for the locals
I recently took my boyfriend to this restaurant for his birthday
I wanted a place that combined great food with a romantic atmosphere
The restaurant is very small, but very cozy
With flickering candlelight, and soft Italian music playing in the background, we were charmed
We had a 9 p
m
reservation, and by the time we looked up, it was 11 p
m
My entree of ravioli stuffed with broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent
The authentic Italian menu and wine list offer something for every palate
My boyfriend could not stop talking about the wonderful time he had
Of course it was the company, but the restaurant was the perfect accompaniment
We will definitely be going back for an encore!
or it used to be a secret little place! Always busy, sometimes they take reservations sometimes not, but the food is always good and the atmosphere cozy
POrtion sizes are irregular -- if you're hungry stick with the tortellini, because the other pastas are very small portions
Get there after 7pm on a weekend and you'll have a 45-minute wait! GReat place to take out-of-town visitors for a truly New YOrk-y Village-y dining experience
The bolognese was great, the homemade pasta was perfect
The waitress made wonderful suggestions and kept us very entertained
We went on saturday night to this great place, and i can tell you that here you can have the best food for the money they ask, and the service is so friendly and amazing that you want to come back
Thanks to the waitress' advice from Barcelona, we ate a amazing rissoto
Tanti Baci is the perfect little West Village Italian Restaurant
It is a great place to come if you are looking for a good italian meal without all the fuss
Very quaint and simple
The food and service just don't get any better
The Daily Specials are always delicious
And the prices are very reasonable
I will definitely come back
Let me tell you something
You can really endulge yourself in this restaurant
I have eaten in many places in the city, and one thing is for sure, the food isnt always tasty, but theres a pretty good chance the prices are way up there
The quality of the food that you get is excellent despite the low prices at Tanti Baci still amazes me
You can really dine like a star, but you dont have to be one
This adds to the atmosphere of the place, bringing together a variety of clientle
The food was out of this world, and you dont have to be rich to experience it
This is a very good neighborhood cafe
Nothing out of the ordinary

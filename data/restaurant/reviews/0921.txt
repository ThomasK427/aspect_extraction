i was starving
until the appetizer came
If they improved the service it would be awesome
Took my girlfriend to Lucy the other night thinking it was Mexican
I was surprised to find out that it was now serving Latin cuisine
I was looking forward to having guacamole but was informed that Lucy no longer makes it
I felt let down until the waiter recommended we try something called chorishrimp to take our minds off the guacamole
WOW
Chorizo, shrimp and tomato salsa over sweet plantain puree with plantain chips
We then had an aphrodisiac clam ceviche (special that night) and the hamachi ceviche from the menu
Both incredible
We continued on to the seafood stew and beef tenderloin
Again, incredible
Finally, we ordered dessert, cafe tres leches, which our server said was in the NY Post
Dynamite
From beginning to end, the food and service were impeccable
When I left I couldn't remember why I wanted Mexican that night
Can't wait to come back
I don't understand how the first drink on the drink list could be SO BAD! The worst mojito ever - not sure what they are calling mojitos but not like one I have ever had
We reluctantly tried Lucy again, since it's so close to home
Again, a painfully slow dining experience
It was Saturday night, but some of the table's were empty, so there really was no excuse why it took 3
5 hours for four of us to dine
Reservations 8:30
We sat at 9:15, with empty tables in the retaurant
It's a nice restaurant, in a huge space
The food was good, (I had the seared tuna), but as with our first vist, painfully slow, and not worth the wait
The waiter offered a round on the house for the wait, but of course, added it to the check, and didn't remember the gesture
Nice
It's a nice place to go if you want a lenghthly dining experience
Don't' go if you're really hungry or have after dinner plans
There are too many restaurants for us to go back
I've been to Lucy at least 5 times in the last 4 months and have referred it to a number of people BUT went last night with a couple from out of town and was totally disappointed with the drink menu ($12 for a small capirinha! and not enough choices; they didn't even have one that was on the menu); the appetizers were delicious but again SMALL and expensive) but worst of all the service was the worst I've ever seen! We had a smart mouthed waiter and had to call him or others over for everything from drinks to spoons for dessert
The food was still delicious but PLEASE bring back the guacamole!
I can't understand all the negative reviews Lucy has received
My experience has been nothing but EXHILARATING
The service provided by the BARTENDER was ASTONISHINGLY PROMPT
The bartender was refilling our drinks before we were even finished with our current drinks
The bartender had lots of brilliant ideas on introducing us to different types of drinks
I strongly recommend this place to any group of friends who are looking to have a GREAT TIME!!!!!!!
Never have I come across more authentic Mexican cuisine with an infusion of New York City glamour and charm
From the moment the lively music lured me in to the gorgeous and vibrant interior to my exit, while I was pampered by the expert staff, and feasting on the INCREDIBLE and extremely reasonable gourmet food -- I couldn't help but forget I was indeed in NYC and not in my own villa in Mexico
I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone searching for a dining experience out of this world, and something that EVERY NEW YORKER MUST EXPERIENCE!!!!
This is one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants I've visited
It covers only one floor floors - but with a great ambience - make sure you have some drinks in the lounge first
And afterwords of course
Lucy has a great range of delicious food - we sampled the guacamole with chips and the butterfly fish as appetizers, they were great and inexpensive compared to the other dishes at other mexican restauranta, but this is about the best fish you'll ever taste
salsa and chips, tacos, salada and other dishes were all spot on
My favorite Margaritas was on the list so I was an even happier man
Service is informal and pleasant
Our bill came to about $80 with tip, which was great value for an excellent evening
We got there at 10pm and were the last to leave at 1am
I'll be back
Thanks for everything
last friday my friends and i decided to go to lucy for diner and we just loved it!! we are planning already when we're going back the food was very exotic, is was just excellent, the decoration is something that you don't see every day in the city, and the music goes just fine with the restaurant
To be seated we only waited 10 min
and we got our drinks, and all the courses at the perfect time
the waiter couldn't have been nicer and he was very helpful explaining the dishes and making suggestions, we loved everything
the service was very good and even though they were very busy they made sure that all of us were ok, even the manager who was very friendly and came to our table to see how everything was
lucy is one of the best restaurants in the city, you'll love it!
The place looks nice on the inside, very stylish decor and ambience
However, once you sit down and realize that you are paying a small fortune for small portions, you may want to save $2 for a slice later in the night
Service for our group was extremely poor: waiters forgot food, charged for more entrees than were ordered, did not refill drinks through the entire meal, and were dreadfully slow
The group spent so much time pouring over the bill trying to figure out how we had been overcharged that we left frustrated
However, the food, once you get over the price, was very good
Went about a week ago with a large group of friends
We were seated and then proceeded to wait about 15-20 minutes to get menus
After getting our menus, we waited another 5 or 10 minutes
then had to go and find someone to take our drink order
Basically we were treated like crap and had to wait WAY too long for everything
Athough the food was ok, it was relatively expensive
I'm pretty sure I will never go back
I have to say this restaurant has probably the best decor of any restaurant in the city
from the red tiles roofing built into the ceiling to the color top of the bar to the seating even bathrooms
this place is cool, cutting edge and fun to have dinner in
food was phenomenal, one of best mexican places in NYC
waiter couldn't have been nicer
Shouldn't be missed
I must admit I'm a foodie!
and I've been following the pastry chef Alex Asteinza for many years now
I first met him at Cena about eight years ago, and was amazed at the creations he contrived
The thing I like about his desserts is that they don't just stick to flour, sugar, fruits, and chocolate
He incorporates anything from herbs, to chiles, to BACON to bleu cheese! and they actually work
I met him twice and I tried to understand how his mind/palatte works and all I can say is it's ingenious
The desserts I recommend are difinitely the plantain with rum, the chocolate with chile powder and the bunuelos!! I must also say that the D
F
Margaritas were awesome and the picaditas were delicious!!
If you are looking for a play to chill out and have fun you may want to try Lucy!!! We had a great experience with my friends today
We order a lots of appetizers and drinks, the drinks were out of this world
The best mojito I ever tryed are from Lucy
The music was great, the all place was incredible
I will come again next saturday with more friends
Venue: Its nice, no doubt
Food: Presentation was great, but quality not so
Spicy shrimp salad was nearly flavorless
And the shrimp for my shrimp taco was overcooked
Service: Destroyed the whole experience
Our waiter was quite pleasant, but UNBELIEVABLY slow
It took 1/2 hour to greet us take our wine order
And then another 1/2 hour to bring the wine! But the worst was the number of mistakes on our check

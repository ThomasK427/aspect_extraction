I don't get to Little Italy often so for a change, headed down with a few friends recently for dinner
I was referred to this place by another friend, and what a great recommendation
I'm very particular about not only food, but service
Lucky for us, both of these were great! Extensive menu selection, declicious food and very good service (didn't rush us as we schmoozed over dinner)
If you find yourself in Little Italy, definitely check this place out
I dont get some of these bad reviews,
yeh LittleItaly is a bit touristy, but it is nice to sit outside without a bus driving by when your eating
I had a great meal, very relaxed table
overall a great change from crowded midtown options
Had dinner there recently and was impressed by the caliber of service and menu
The wait staff attending to our table, the food wine were outstanding
here's alot ofoption sin the area but add this to your list!
during the week i went with 3 of my friends to little italy to have a dinner
we sat out side on a big terrale of CASA BELLA restaurant
wow
the food was outstanding every thing is great
the staff was so freindly and helpful
the atmosphere was amazing speasialy the music
i will always come back to CASA BELLA where i got the best meal in my life
simply the best in little italy
I went to Casa Bella to have dinner with some friends of mine
We had a great time
The atmosphere was nice, the waiters were friendly and the food was delicious
Can't wait to go back
this is one of the best restaurants in Little Italy - since I have lived in the area my whole life i been to many retsaurtants on Mulberry St and by far this is my favorite
the waitstaff was prompt and attentive, and the food was delicious
It is a must go
My friend and I, went to Casa Bella Saturday night
We had such a good time
We had a drink at the bar before dinner
Very nice
Our dinner was excellent
The waiter was helpful and cute! We were able to relax and were'nt rush
Go check it out
My friends and I had a great expereince at Casa Bella
We were treated as if we were the only customers in the restaurant
The food was delicious, true Italian style
There is a lot of competition in Little Italy and I am never sure where to dine
I am happy to say that I now have a true favorite in the area
Save room for the desert, they are extra yummy
We went to Casa Bella to eat and watch the World cup
We went with no reservation
The entire street was packed with people
a line to get in the restaurant
But we were seated within 20 minutes
How lucky did we get?! We had an amazing dinner
The entire World Cup experience was fantastic! My favorite ITALIAN RESTAURANT
The service was okay and the food was fairly good (I had manicotti)
The best part though was the dessert
I eat in Little Italy all the time, and this place has the best tiramisu I've ever had
the food was crap
the service was crap
the management was evil
do not eat at this resaurant if you want to have any happiness in your day
I have unfortunately been here a few times
The first one was fine
Not memorable
The second time I was here, my friends and I found the food to be too salty
We also didn't like that the service was lounging around staring at us, as if they couldn't wait to pounce on our tips
When it was time to pay, we didn't want to split our big bills, but we managed to put down a somewhat satisfactory tip
However, I guess one of the waitresses didn't think so
She comes over and says to us, You know that it is 'social law' to tip at least 15% right? So ok
the tip was a bit lower than 15%, but for her to come over and tell us? That is just rude
I'm from the same SouthEast Asian region that this restaurant's food represents and while there are regional variations that I'm not particularly fond of, they are authentic
What I liked about the Char Kway Teow here was they used pork fat instead of oil like it's done back there--you can taste the delicious crunchy remnants in the noodles
The Hainanese Chicken Rice, Hor Fun with Egg Sauce, Nasi Lemak and Lorbak are very authentic (having eaten the original in Penang island itself)
The Beef Rendang is a bit iffy but some may like it
I always bring friends there to introduce them to food from home
Growing up, I live in SE Asia region for 10 years
this Penang branch has the most authentic taste in the city
I found my old favorite here: Pork With Dried Vegetable + Rice
may look unappetizing to some, for me, it tasted like a comforting Asian stew
Food was good, ambience was nice! I recommend it for both food and ambience
It has a nice menu as well
I tried some other Malei restaurants, but this is by far the winner
The food is great, and considering the fact that it's in Chinatown, the decor and ambiance also is not too shabby either
Very delicious and creative food with variety of ingredients
And you can't beat their price
The food is much better than the SoHo branch
It is also cheaper in price
It's more meal and less foo-foo
This restaurant is my first choice for Malaysian food
the service I got on August 5, 2006 was the absolute worse service I have ever received in new york or any other city
Let's begin where thing went wrong 1) sat down, ignored for 10 minutes until someone asked us what we wanted to drink 2) another 10 minutes passed by until someone brought us bread
meanwhile, in these 20 minutes, other patrons are seated, given drinks and wine, and have their appetizers
Request for olive oil and vinegar are not honored by waitstaff 3) after ANOTHER 15 minutes, the rude waiter who doesn't bother to explain to us how the family style dishes work, decides to finally get our order
We are unsure of the family style dishes, and the waiter doesn't explain, we end up ordering 4 dishes for 6 people that did not satisfy at all 4) after another 15-20 minutes, the waiter comes out with 4 plates
He realizes three of these plates are not our order and leaves the 4 plate at our table which is also not our order
This 4th plate sits at our table for 5 minutes, but no one at our table touches it because we know it's not ours
He comes back takes the plate and brings it to another table
This can't be a healthy practice, what if we touched it or coughed in it? etc etc
5) after another 10 minutes the food FINALLY comes
small portions, average food 6) we ask for the check, the waiter says, ok, and 5 minutes later asks if we want coffee or dessert
We say, check please and the waiter acts as if this was the first time we asked him 7) 18% service charge
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
I am retired now,but I have traveled all over the world for business
I went to La Mela on July 15,2006
It was a crowded Sat night,yet it seems that the waitstaff were expecting me
While waiting for 3 more diners of my party to arrive,the waitstaff brought a chair for me to sit on
(the street was closed) in the street

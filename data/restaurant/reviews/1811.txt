We were a group of 6 people
Its a small place and gets crowded, but the food was great and service was prompt
This place is just great
Very small and intimate, but that adds to its charm
The food is top quality, very flavorful and well worth the moderate price
The staff is extremely courteous and knows how to take care of their customers
After ordering a pitcher of sangria, two tapas, and an order of paella, the restaurant bought us a round of port wine (and they've done this each time we've visited)
Totally recommend this place all around
Highly suggest you sit at the bar for added atmosphere and generally friendly people
Really tiny place, just like tapas bars should be
Delicious, traditional tapas
Don't pass up the solomillo
The sangria is pretty good
I love the guitar playing and the whole feel like you're in Spain
ate here on a recent sat
nite
I had a reservation, but since the place is kinda small, we were seated at a reserved seat at the bar which i wasnt' too happy with
prefer a table to a bar stool any day
we were promptly seated at a table since one had become available
Tapas were very tasty as is the paella
Didn't love the sangria but it did the trick
Service was good
but rushed
All in all, a solid choice,
i'll be back
There are so many tapas place in NYC now, but I always love this place and it keeps me coming back
Try all Tapas (all of them are yummy) Sangria
It's very crowded after 5 and weekends
el cid really had authentic spanish food
the mushrooms and the croquettes were fabulous, and the beef was really good
if u go in groups 2 paellas are more than enough, the portions are gigantic
only thing about this place it is REALLY crowded and the seating is really tight
go when it isnt too busy!
I have been raving about this place since my first visit! Everything we ordered - and we ordered a lot - was extremely good
The service was also excellent - the waiter kept our food coming in perfect timing
The whole atmosphere was very comfortable and enjoyable
If you are more into the scene than the food, you'd be better off hitting Flor De Sol or another trendy Latin place, but if you just want delicious Spanish food in a low-key atmosphere for a great price, Spain is always the answer
My boyfriend is from Nicaragua and loves the Paella and after having it here, I cannot enjoy it anywhere else (unless he makes it for me and even then, Spain might edge him out)
The staff is friendly and while the atmosphere is nothing special, it's not the worst place to eat either
Like many places in NY, there are no credit cards accepted but with these prices, that should not be an issue
It's
The food is the best and as soon as you seat it starts to come, the Tappas are really good, the sangria is one of the best and trust you will love the Lobster, if you go to New York you have to go to this restaurant
If this restaurant was a movie, it won't garner an Oscar nomination, but will definitely be a Box Office hit
Expect to be fed and satisfied
Not for the connoisseur but well worth going to!!! The Paella Valenciana w/ Lobster at $18
50 good for 2-3 people (with the free tapas, you will be full) can't be beat!
I have been going to this restaurant with my family for the past 25 years and have always been delighted with my experiences
Although the atmosphere may not be trendy enough for some, Spain more then makes up for it by serving the best sangria and steaks in the city(paella too)
The free tapas have been the same for years, they are authentic and so delicious
I love them! There is no need to make a reservation for small parties, but if if it's going to be a large one call ahead
I highly reccomend giving this restaurant a try, you'll get a fabulous meal, great drink, and a tiny bill
I've been going to this place since I was a kid and will continue to go back always
The food was average
It was freezing cold out and it wasn't all that warm in the back dining area
I was cold! Don't sit in the back room in a cold day
Service was prompt
Servers are friendly
Good Sangria
The lady's room was clean which is a big plus! I would go back there again
tried finding an inexpensive place for spanish food since we were in the mood for paella and i found Spain Restaurant
1st of all, when you walk thru the door, it smells like damp towels
the tables are in the back and the ambience was less to be desired
right after sitting down before ordering the waiters brought out free appetizers: ribs, salad, and mussels
the ribs were really salty and so was the salad? the mussels were tasty tho but still pretty fishy
we ordered the paella valenciana and it was pretty bland
dont think i would ever go back
I've never been to a restaurant and paid so little and gotten so much
For $15
50, I got the Paella Marinera which was beyond filling in itself, but before it even came, the waitstaff provided more than ample appetizers for my group that by the time that the meal came to us, we were so stuffed, we could barely finish up the meal
Definately recommended to anybody who wants an excellent lunch or dinner, doesn't want to spend a lot, and isn't too picky on restaurant ambiance
Sure, the place isn't sexy but for $20
00 or less, you can be STUFFED like never before
Worth trying for an inexpensive neighborhood meal
Give it a shot
Spain is one of the best kept secrets in NYC
I have been going for the last 10 years and the food is always delicious
Remember that cash is king here, no credit cards are taken but the prices are more than reasonable
The entrees are large and lots of free tapas at the beginning of the meal which means you are getting big bang for the bucks!
Yes this restaurant is cash-only, and yes it's not the most chic atmosphere in NYC, BUT the ample food, friendly service and unique ambience make it worth the trip
I had an excellent time there a year ago and again last night
The waitstaff brought us so many free tapas (chilled mussels, spare ribs, chorizo, sauteed shrimp) along with our house salad and bread that we barely had room for the entrees
The wine selection is limited but reasonably priced, relative to other NYC dining experiences
The dining area can get a little noisy but that adds to the Spanish cantina atmosphere
The service was attentive and friendly
The entrees were enormous and very well prepared
I recommend perhaps sharing some of the main course selections if dining with multiple companions
See you soon at Spain!
The restaurants overall feeling is that of a cheap cafeteria
The food is not well presented and insipid
The service is overall unfriendly and rude
The owner asked to walk two blocks to an ATM to retrieve cash
I DO NOT recomend this restaurant
I've gone to this place, geez a million times , on dates with groups
It's a great place the paella sangria are awesome and I love love love the free tapas
The funniest thing though is how I once tried to describe it to someone new
My first words were Okay it may look a little scary
lol
The ambiance of the place could use some work
It's been around for ages and I think they never changed the decor
(kind of like your grandmother or great grandmothers house

Do try the fries, believe me they are good
Could not believe the ripoff
Boeuf Jamon was a fried egg on a skinny piece of boiled ham, overcooked and tasteless
ok, so i heard great things about pastis and was excited to go

what a let down
while the wait staff was kind and attentive, the service was extremely rushed
the food was average, i would recommend going to another french bistro and save yourself $20
it was way too crowded, i felt like i was in my neighbor's lap
not to mention that the waiter offered putting a scoop of ice cream on my dessert

i could understand an additional fee for a scoop of ice cream, but an extra $3
50 for a golf ball size scoop is ludicrious
The food is OK
Service is poor and the place is so damn crowded
DO NOT sit in table by the bar, it is unavoidable that you will accidentally be bumped and spill food on yourself or worst yet your date
There may be no better new york dining experience than sitting in the sidewalk cafe and watching the world pass by
The perfect place to eat before or after apt(my new favorite new york drinking hole)
The bar is hopping and full of great looking downtowners
Seated indoors and out, mostly at small tables are satisfied diners enjoying things like roast lobster with garlic, monkfish stew (absolutely delicious), a buttery halibut that was sensational, a stew, steak/frites, a caesar salad with bacon to make it just a little more special and, of course the side of frites with mayonnaise
The place looks convincingly French brasserie and Keith Mc Nally knows how to please his customers
When he saw I was cold, a bottle of wine was delivered
On another occasion a free dessert was offered
They aim to please
Start with a kir
Even the glass of wine was great (the sancerre)
Pastis is a more casual and relaxed version of its soho cousin balthazar
Located in the meatpacking district you can always find hip trendy folks, some euros, and New Yorkers who know a good thing when they find it
Whether going for drinks or steak frites, which is excellent, you can always rely on Pastis to be an entertaining time
It works for both a date spot, as well as a place to hang with a group or friends
The staff is nice, and the setting authentic - you can forget it's the meatpacking district and pretend you're in paris
The food at the best is mediocre,the house wines are bad,cappuccino awful
Other than the food and the wine,the place is good
Great location,nice outdoor cafe and friendly staff
I loved it
I have been a long-time fan of Balthazar, and Pastis has one underlying commonality
the French authenticity that is exacted with precision from the decor to the food
From the opaque windows to the aged look of the white tiles that were probably painstakingly placed on the walls, it's a wonderfully transporting dining experience
The food was very simple, yet very tasty, too
Traditional bistro fare that hurts your wallet less than its more-refined sister restaurant
The waitress was not as friendly as I would have liked, and the kitchen was a bit slow, but the service itself was impeccable
I would recommend it
In addition to having the best fries in the city, Keith McNally's Pastis is one of the most pleasant environments to have a meal
Luring an attractive crowd with the occasional celebrity, this casual version of McNally's Balthazar restaurant has a feel good decor and a wonderful sidewalk cafe that's prefect for summer
Hits on the menu include the steak frites, braised beef, salmon salad and croque monsieur, with liver pate and oysters as terrifc appetizers
Also, on Saturdays and Sundays McNally imports a wonderful Panier basket filled with cakes and sweet breads from dowtown Balthazar and which are available until 4:00 PM
This is a truly wonderful and fun place, although you do have to speak a little loudly as the decibels, as in all McNally restaurants, can reach epic proportions
Went the other night and couldn't believe how much better this place has gotten! The food was uneven for the first years but they have gotten it down now
Can't miss steak frites and truly wonderful, fresh salads
A peach bellini to die for!
I took my best friend there for her birthday and besides an unusually enjoyable 15 minute wait (we were so engaged in coversation with other patrons it was almost sad to sit) the place was perfect
It was a little crowded but from the hostess to the waitress the service was great
The food was delicious
I plan on going there as often as I can
Atmosphere and the food are great
Can get crowded sometimes, but no different than other popular places in NY
The food at Pastis is prepared absolutely flawless, simple and perfect
Everything from the tasty peasant bread, the refreshing Gazpacho, the Steak Frite, Halibut and amazing Beefsteak Tartatare(which had no anchovies
yummy!)
If you can manage to get a reservation
EAT HERE!!!
Good people-watching
Very friendly personnel
Not a good menu, but hey, can't have everything
Good place to just hang out
Pastis is what it's suppose to be
That is a working man's Bistro with traditional dishes well prepared and inexpensive
In addition it has a great bar scene with great house cocktails
It also has two outdoor dining areas
If you have a bad time at Pastis it probably because your not having a great day
Went here with some new friends and out-of-towners - the food was good but wasn't cooked properly
Fun bathrooms and good bar area - have to try it again before I write off the food
Pastis is a perfect, charming neighborhood French bistro with affordable bistro fare
The steak frites are great, as are some of the seafood specials
But it's the ambience that is the draw for me---sipping red wine and sitting under the red awning on a warm night
there's nothing better
First time I have ever been
I was a expecting a nightmare hotspot with poor food and crappy service
I was pleasantly surprised to find the food excellent and the staff friendly and accommodating
the omelet and onion soup very delicious
i would recommend that you go mid-week to avoid overcrowding
Still a scene even after all these years, you can still count on Pastis to draw in models, fashionistas and media types
Pastis is sort of like a Disneyland version of a French bistro, right down to the distressed mirrors and other iconographic touches
Pastis is a fun place if you want a scene and bistro food that is fairly decent
You have all your regular suspects on the menu: croque monsieur, snails, blanquette de veau, etc
Tiny complaint: they need to use gruyere in the French Onion soup
In Short The atmosphere is low-key, but baseball games on the TV above the bar and blaring salsa and merengue on the jukebox provide constant lively entertainment
Enchiladas, tacos and burritos come piled with cheese and guacamole and are accompanied by huge sides of rice and beans
The restaurant also offers more exotic fare, such as cow paws soup, octopus salad, oxtail stew, lobster in hot sauce and more
They'll even make you a cheeseburger
ENA is the quinteseesntial 'divey' neighborhood restaurant
The service is average, the ambiance is laid back but it a great place for Comfort Mexcian/Caribbean food (if such a thing exists)
The food is very tasty, portions generous and the prices great
Highly recommended if you want yto have a meal and no Hoopla
Great food but the service was dreadful! the two waitress's looked like they had been sucking on lemons
The service was dreadfully slow (the place was only half full) and a smile would have been nice
But the food and drink when it came was fantastic, huge protions and a even better price
I would highly recommend it if you don't mind your food behind slamed in front of you and you are not in rush
I used to live nearby and ate here at least twice a week
The food is tasty and the margaritas are the BEST in the city

The sevice is always friendly and commendable
I eat there at least twice a week
Always fantastic! I highly recommend it
Nice try
They got me because they do work with animl adoption, and I'm a sucker for lost dogs, so I went in (I bet they get lots of dog lovers to come in)
It is a trap ! The food is well bellow average, and the prices are well above what you pay on the Upper east side, I must say the crowd was the best thing they had going the night I went, it seems like they all knew each other, I must have missed something, I don't know, maybe I'll try it again sometime,maybe in a less crowded night the service will be a little better
but then again
I don't know
I love fetch and I go there almost weekly
The penne with pesto and grilled chicken is amazing (and even better the next day for lunch!) Customers photos of their dogs enhance the warm, cozy, and inviting atmosphere
The service is attentive yet relaxed
I have never felt rushed, always get prompt water refills (etc), and the food comes quickly
(Please note in Manhattan I always have to pay for coke refills :) I have brought many people to Fetch for dinner and they all love it! I also have to commend Fetch on their commitment to helping unite dogs with loving homes through locals orgs such as Animal Haven
I've been to Fetch a few times for brunch and the place is great for a quick meal
I've brought my family and visiting friends on Sunday and we've always had a great time
I'd definitely recommend trying them out

to raise a family, I was introduced to Fetchs on the Upper East Side, a pleasant surprise
The luncheon and dinner menus are varied and tasty
After several visits I was invited to place a photo of my little girl Gretchen, the cutest Jack Russell in the world, on their walls joining a large montage of other adorable four legged Best Friends
On my last visit, the local animal shelter was given the use of the restaurants outside tables and chairs to help place some of their homeless citizens hoping to situate them in loving arms
Fetchs commitment to animals is only surpassed by the savory entrees they serve
Their dedicated work in the community should be applauded
I look forward to my next visit

I went to Fetch because I passed it and didn't know any better and had a terrible experience
Not only is the decor subpar (dog pictures adorn the walls) but the service was slow and the menu uninspired
But if you take nothing else from my review, get this: The waitress kept offering to refill my soda and when I got the check at the end of the meal, she had charged me for all 11 sodas that she refilled between me and my guest
Free refills are standard practice these days, especially when the waitress takes it upon herself to do so
Overall, this was a terrible place with a terrible meal, flavorless steak, and ripped off in the end
I was very disappointed
Fetch is my new favorite place to go
The staff here is friendly and accomodating
The food is delicious and the atmosphere is warm and inviting
This place has a great big, beautiful bar that I love to bring friends to or go by myself, and the dog photos on the walls, which I believe are brought in by customers, make it so fun to look around!
I had a blind date there the other evening and was nervous about the ambience
When I arrived, there was the most beautiful friendly blonde greeting us at the door
We had the best meal ever!!! I will most certainly go back
Fetch is the home of United Steaks of America, the best cheese steak outside Philadelphia
This place has it all- a great atmosphere, very friendly waitstaff, amazing food and a litte something else
Don't let the dog motif throw you off, it is a gentle and wonderful touch to the restaurant
Fred's has become my favorite neighborhood place (speaking about the one on 3rd Ave)
Been there 3 times, its OUT! I gave it chance after chance, each time, BAD!! SUSHI was horrible
I can tolerate a lot because sushi is my favorite food, and i have gone to lots of fast food
It was just TERRIBLE
I have had their Unadon (eel on rice) - super small portion for the price
Their chicken teriyaki tastes bad too, any grocery store can make it better
Service is SLOW! Pricey because of the area
DONT DO IT!! BAD!! BAD!!
now called nikki sushi, sushi is OK
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac! oysters/tempura goog
but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection)
lunch is busy
SUM IT: local investment bankers like it, try for yourself at least once
Since moving into the neighborhood, we eat here 1-2 times per week
We used to eat in, but more recently get delivery
Much better value than more flashy NYC spots and the sushi will be fresh!
Unbelievable and very fairly priced
Sashimi and specialty rolls (3rd ave roll is a must) are unreal!
We waited almost 2 hours for our delivery and we live only a few blocks away
We started calling around the 45 minute mark and were told that the delivery guy just left
We called a couple more times every 15 min
with no good answer as to what the hold up was and we had to re-order
We also wanted to speak to the manager who they said didn't want to talk to us, so we walked down there to tell him what happened
He was very unsympathetic and offered that we pay $3 less for our food
We said that's ridiculous and he threw our food away rather than keeping 2 customers! Luckily, there was a normal and polite sushi place across the street
Ever since the first time I went to Iron Sushi by chance, I've returned faithfully atleast once a week to feast on their sushi
This place
to put it crudely - ROCKS!  They have an interesting selection of jumbo rolls, their appetizers (the pepper steak melts in your mouth) are delicious and everything is so reasonably priced you can't stop eating
The sushi chefs have a great sense of humour, service is excellent and I love the fact that everyone feels comfortable to walk in sweats straight from the gym
Iron Sushi is one of the best things about living in this neighbourhood
A word of advice though - they get so much business that they sometimes run out and make portions smaller than they should be
I've only experienced this once but try going on days when seafood is delivered to ensure generous portions
so many Japanese restaurants in the city focus on the sushi, and neglect the rest of the menu
Kazusa serves delicious sushi, but I very rarely eat it because I'm too busy trying all the other inventive and tasty things on the menu! and while the decor might not live up to New Yorkers' expectations of a Japanese restaurant, I count that as a plus - this is an elegant, comfortable restaurant that is totally unpretentious
Kazusa has become one of my favorite japanese rest
in the uper east side
You are seated promptly, and you have great fish at a great price
The atmosphere needs a kick, and the music doesn't fit the ambiance, however the sushi, shashimi, and tempura dishes are great
The other day I had a whole broiled squid and it was amazing
Take someone here and it won't cost you a fortune
Kazusa offers innovative cooked-food as well as fresh, tasty sushi, all at reasonable prices without the snotty attitude at Haru and other Upper East Side spots
The sushi chefs are well-trained and create fresh exciting works of art
Try the Omu-rice (a chicken and rice dish wrapped in a thin omelette) or the Kushiyaki (Shishito Peppers are Tasty treats) if you like kitchen dishes
DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE
Kazusa started out as being an easy place to get sushi without the hassle of waiting
It is not a super trendy or social hot spot, but it is very clean, very well managed, and the people who work there care about their customers
This is a place that will survive and is now a neighborhood hang-out
Why? Because the sashimi and traditional Japanese dishes are absolutely excellent
The sashimi quality and cleanliness factor rival NObu-without the pomp, the arrogance, and Californiazation
The suhi chefs know their stuff and call their customers out by name
Skip the take-out, and head for the suhi bar
This is a place for after-work, a quiet friendly date, or any of the above
I love Kazusa!!!!!!
The food is some of the best japanese I've had outside of Tokyo
The ingredients always fresh, and always very tasty
The waitstaff is friendly and attentive; and the decor is pleasant in an Asian-minimalist style
This place is in my neigborhood, so I stop by often, and I've never had anything but a great meal with great service

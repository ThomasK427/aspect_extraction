Well the ambiance, decor cigar roller make up for the lack of service Cuba is able to provide
The Sangria the live band helped to shorten the 2 hour wait we had for our 9 pm reservation
Mind you, a reservation that was made over 6 weeks prior, confirmed, reconfirmed the same day
Staff apologies aside, the restaurant is best for small parties off nights
The main dining room gets more crowded as Happy hour progresses
All in all: Good food, Great price, less than stellar service
what a great place! the ambience is fantastic; we were seated in the back room which was really cozy and well decorated
the mojito was the best i've ever had, and they have a good selection of Chilean and Argentinean wines too
the appetizer we shared [pototo balls stuffed w/ cheese] was delicious, albeit small
get one for each of you! great seafood selection; the red snapper on a bed of plantains was the best thing i've had in a long time! my friend loved her steak, and even though shes not a vegetable lover, they were the first thing off her plate! The portions are just perfect - you'll finish your plate AND you'll be satisfied
especially if you try the desserts - the flan was delicious as was the chocolate souffle
the bill, for two came to 90 WITH tip
absolutely worth it for such a great night!
This place is excellent
I had a great time
The inside is very cute, the pictures dont do it justice
Our server was polite and the service was fast, a rare combination in NYC
He greeted us with a smile and made us feel very comfortable
The mojitos here are AWESOME! This was my first time eating at Cuba but it will not be my last
I'll be back
We went to Cuba with a party of seven on Saturday night
We were early for our reservation but they seated us right away
Our waiter Tony was the best, fast, courteous and made sure our pitchers of Mojito and Sangria were always filled
The food is outstanding from the appetizers to the desserts, we were all stuffed and happy with the savory Cuban flavors
The band rocked the house and sang Happy Bday to my friend and got everyone in the place involved
They even served her a Flan with flame shooting sparklers as her candle, it was so exciting
Hand rolled Cigars are given to all patrons and they were great
My husband smoked it that night and raved about it
Truly an outstanding time!!! We will definitely be back!
The host was very accomodating and our waiter was so friendly
We had a large party and was originally seated downstairs
However, we wanted to sit upstairs for the entertainment, so they moved us and we were seated promptly
This restaurant has great menu selection and extremely reasonable prices
I recommend the Suckling Pig and Paella Valenciana
Also, if you go there, try not to be seated too close to the musicians
We were seated right behind them and since the place is pretty small, we had to shout to hear each other
I had a party of 15 this last saturday at the downstair room called Hemingway
The mojitos were terrific, the music out of this world, service cordial and friendly, something very unusuall in this days
The only problem was the manager who introduced himself, as Jorge, aproached our table in numerous time asking if everything was right, something that became kind of annoying, until I noticed alcohol breath coming from him
That explained everything, although, I'll absolutlly come back
The place is exellent as the food, it has a special atmosphere, It's the hot place in the Village, last friday I tried the Hallibut and it was exellent, It was one of the best fish that I have ever try
The staff was really great, everybody smile, and you can feel how happy everybody was
I will recomend this place to everyone
If Cuba changed its wait staff's attitude, this place could be a really great restaurant
The waiter became visibly irritated when we didn't want to order any drinks at the start of the evening
I don't know, I guess he really likes serving drinks and us not ordering drinks just ruined his evening
My wife ordered Paella Valenciana but got Paella Marinera
I didn't want to make a big deal out of this so I just let it go
We ended up actually wanting a couple of glasses of wine later in the evening with our food but I figured if this place gets so hung up over drinks and they can't get the food right, better to save my money and spend it somewhere else
Oh, you should have seen the look on the waiter's face when we told him we didn't want any coffee after the meal
The service was horrible and painfully slow
Our female server was RUDE, had ATTITUDE, and SARCASTIC! My mother is from Cuba, and my family came from LA to visit me, so we made the mistake of coming here
it really put a sour note on our experience
There are many other great cuban restaurants in the city
try ANY other one!
I had a farewell party on Friday night for 14 people, and was a little nervous simply because I'd never been there before
Although I made the reservation the same day Ricardo, the manager, accommodated us and gave us a special party room at the back
We all had an awesome time and all my friends loved it
We're definitely going back
Mojitos and the sangria were the best I ever had in the city
The food was delicious and our waiter was great - very friendly and fun
The music and the ambience made us feel like we were in Cuba - was a great experience overall
The hand-rolled cigars at the end was the final touch of excellence
As a Cuban , I really recomend this restaurant
The food and drinks are very good
like in the real Havana !!!!!!!!
The live music and the cigars are a plus
And If you want to know about the real Cuba , talk to Sergio
this has been the best cuban food,the live music,the best mojitos in town,the sangria rocks,,service is great,they make you feel part of family,go to cuba you wiil love it
What a great place, just like Zagat 2006 mentioned it
Caribbean authenticity comes to the Village via this new Cuban Really the best Mojito's, Ropa Vieja, Live music the hand-rolled cigars
I had great time with my friends
Thank you CUBA!!
Went here for Valentine's day this year
Food was very good
Live music was excellent (purchased the CD)
Romantic and lively at the same time
Hot and sexy
We both had a really great time
too bad we eventually ended up breaking up anyway, lol
Resevations are recommended as they have become fairly popular
Went here for a birthday party and felt like I was in a cave
Nothing is CUBAN about the rest
The food is average, anywhere spanish food
The tostones with mojo were probably the best thing
The Sangria is awesome
Cool that you can take your own cd's and play them yourself! not sure if this is the case on the weekends
Will come again, but not expencting extraordinary service
It's Saturday night, about 10:00, and my girlfriend and I are waiting for a table
Cuba is a small, crampt, cozy ;), place and when the hostess offered to seat us at the table next to the hostess stand/front door/manager I asked politely that if it weren't to much trouble I'd wait for the next table
She glared at me and said it would be a long wait
My outrageous request translated into her refusing to give me a table
When I left the manager gave me lip service
It must feel good to them to look down upon people
It was well worth the wait, the best Cuban food and Mojitos that I had in a very long time
(I had the Red Snapper)
Most of the Cuban restaurants are the same, Cuba's food was very unique, out of this world!! I really recommend it
The live music was enjoyable and the hand rolled cigars made the experience authentic
I will go back this week
I just wanted to send an email to say thanks so much for making my sat

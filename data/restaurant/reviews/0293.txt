Go here
I can't help myself, but stop at FB whenever I am on 23rd St during the day
This place absolutely rocks for lunch or even a cheap and quick dinner
The assortment of sausages is large and inventive
I love the choice of toppings from crunchy onions to yummy kraut and unique ketchups and mustards
The place is cheap, quick, clean and tasty
For dessert skip over to KrispyCream next door
Yes, it's expensive
Yes, they probably need a few more people in back serving up the grub
And yes, it can get a bit crowded
All of this is true
What is also true is that this place is one-of-a-kind with consistently tasty food and a surprisingly amazing choice of beers, lambics, etc
Eat here once a month, at least
Tasty good
Yum! The BEST hot dogs in the city! I love the prarie dog
And they have really good fries
The decor is cute, too
Truly one of my favorite discoveries in Manhattan
If you like hotdogs, you've never tried one like this
Although the ingredients/toppings may seem bizzarre, they definitely work together
The beignets are greatest with dipping sauce
A great selection of tube steaks, fast service and people who seem to actually enjoy what they are doing behind the counter! The lemonade is great too
The dogs here are ok
I appreciate the fun toppings but you really can't beat two hot dogs and a crappy drink for under 2 beans at Gray's, European-style or not
Their hot dogs are somewhat large, tasty, and reasonably-priced
It's not Gray's Papaya, but I don't mind paying a few extra bucks for a better-tasting meal
Cheapest , BEST and Freshest bites
Veggie dog options with all the great toppings a big plus
Awesome frites and onion frites
Friendly service
Best 10 minute snack in the city
I am addicted to their fries; the dips are fun AND the best part is I can eat hot dogs here - I am a vegitarean and the vegi-great dane is so delicious!!! Believe me - its one of those foods that you get addicted to and once you try a great dane - you will want to go back to get another
Really Nice staff - wish it was a bigger place but the guy at the register told me they were in the process of creating new F B's throughout the city
YAY :-) Open near my office on Broadway and 62nd please
Growing up, I never really was a fan of hot dogs
but i have seen the light! F B does a great job with gourmet dogs
Add cool design music, a european flair a beer - you are all set! I recommend the garlic dog
my favorite -- but honestly, you can;t just eat one kind - they have many great selections
We have enjoyed the special atmosphere offered in this delightfull restaurant
Normally everything is cheap; yet this is a different kind of story
We loved it!
I love the fries!!! NOt greasy, crisp and tasty even when delivered
is it lunch time yet?
On a recent trip to New York, I had a chance to eat at your cool restaurant in Chelsea
I was so impressed I went back every day that I was there
Every hot dog is amazing, especially the one with the crispy onions and cucumber slices - YUMMY! The Steak-Frites were righteous, the beignets were better than in N
O
and the little blue bottles of Champagne with a straw were perfect
What a great little jewel you guys have
By the way, I don't know who does your music but one of you has really groove
Thanks and PLEASE come to LA soon
We need you!!!!!
This place is the real deal
Not only are the hot dogs unique and tastey (the healthy dog is my favorite) but the chicken frites and swedish meatballs are also great
Sure you pay a little more than for a NY street dog -but the service with a smile and quality food are well worth it
FB is clearer the leader in pommes frites and hot dogs
It is clean, well designed, fun, reasonably priced and has a great staff
This is perfect movie date destination
My kids go crazy for this place
They are (and so are we) addicted to the great fun
The service is super friendly
Thumbs up!
My 3 year old son loves the name FB as well as their sweet potato fries hot dog
he starts jumping up down as we near the restaurant
I like their clean and friendly environment and the affordable price
This place is my dream snack stop
I am a big hot dog fan, and a bit picky, but these are by far the best dogs I've ever had
A wide range of hot dogs, (as well as other items) for every type of person
Incredible fries and onion rings
Stylish, great music, intelligent staff
I hope they make it a chain
Much better than sitting at a coffee shop with lower prices
Here you know you're getting quality food
Their fries are good, the veggie dogs are good, but this place is not cheap
I can't bring myself to pay for a $3
50 hot dog only to find that I'm still hungry
you can get a combo meal which consists of a dog, fries and a drink, but you'll still be paying $7 with tax
For that kind of money, I'd rather go across the street and get a healthy and filling burrito for less money
This is a great stop for a cheap and tasty lunch in Chelsea
I'm a vegetarian and was estactic to find a wide range of veggie dog options
The pomme frites and sauces are excellent
Fast and friendly service
Highly recommended
scrumptious hot dogs and cool interior and pleasant staff, as well as good beer to go with it all
I find myself going back at least once a week, trying to order someting different but always ending up with the Gaucho or Farm dogs
Don't skip the mixed frites
With a wide and inventive range of hotdogs and sausages, FB takes fast food to a whole different level
The salmon SeaDog, the spicy Gaucho Dog and the FarmDog are just three great riffs on the conventional dog, and, for the more traditional, the standards (chili, cheese, etc
) are available and excellent, too
And the frites--particularly the zucchini frites--are beyond compare
Fast, cheap, and delicious -- and the staff in the bright, Curohappy space are uniformly delightful
Dogs are man's best friend
I have to disagree
I thought the food was wonderful (including the catfish tacos)
I also had the scallops which were divine along with the steak salad
Overall a great date place!
its not the greatest service, its really slow and i thought their special, the catfish taco, was really GROSS! and i love fish normally!
The Scene The tiny dining room--with just five tables--is pleasingly like eating in a rustic kitchen: Greek packaged foods decorate the shiny white walls, and customers bustle to and fro
The waitstaff can be brusque when it's busy, but the atmosphere is generally comfortable
The Food These are simple, hearty Greek dishes with minimal frills

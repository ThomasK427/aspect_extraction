Sichuan should be the main draw, with basics like smoked tea duck and double cooked pork available alongside more intriguing dishes like sliced conch and "Bad Smell Bean Curd
"
I'm from sichuan, this is the restaurant I recommend going
food is delicious, the affordable price makes it more attractive (most items ~$10)
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot
my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy
But people from Sichuan will die for it)  - Chongqing Hot Pot, chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan, now became an independent province
This is also where I was from
:)
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read
Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you
I don't think I would go again
I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC
It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown
If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables
my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu)
Be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it!
If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place
They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food! The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner
The sauce was watery and tasted heavily of MSG
(I was thirsty as hell afterwards
) My companion's entree didn't fare any better either
(Both our entrees were not from the AC section
) His cabbage with baby shrimp came also with the same watery sauce, and no real shrimp, but dried, reconstituted shrimpthe cheapest thing you can buy
He was terribly thirsty after the meal too
What a ripoff! Don't go there!
This branch is run by the same chef as the Chelsea Grand Sichuan branch; dishes we have ordered so far at both Lexington and Chelsea branches have been prepared identically
Major reasons why it gets a higher rating from me:  1
it is less crowded and the service is better (including more personal), 2
the menu is longer, and includes great things like huo guo (aka hot pot or nabe) that are not found at the Chelsea branch
The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese
The fish here is so fresh and the quality of the preparation is really wonderful
The place is very small and sometimes the service is not very prompt, but they certainly make up for it with friendliness
The staff seems genuinely enthusiastic about the food they are serving
Because Y's is AMAZING
The seafood is incredibly fresh
The service is excellent
The atmosphere is serene and pleasant
Both the sushi chef and head chef demonstrate their artistic skill and food preparation prowess in each and every dish
We are regulars, and over and over again the fare is consistent, innovative, and delicious
The quality of your meal will equal its price
Choose to eat here and you will never be disappointed
Great Sushi for a great price- The Sushi deluxe includes fish that you don't typically find in platters
All dishes are fresh and well presented
Appetizers are creativity assembled
The maki is delicious because of the abundant amount of toasted black sesame
Desserts are great- Green Tea ice cream actually tastes like green tea
Staff is courteous and attentive
Overall a great dining experience
We are becoming regulars!
My friends and I enjoyed an amazing dinner here the other night
The fish was the freshest I have had in a long time
We had no idea such a gem was in the neighborhood
The food is excellent, great quality and quantity
The service is very friendly but a bit slow
However, they make up for it in complimentary sake and appetizers
A must eat at restaurant if you like Yasuda and Sushi Den
Hiden on the side of first avenue at 73rd St, this small delightful Japanese restaurant is a surprise find! We visited at least ten times from New Jersey and value is consistently there
Run by an owner of a major fish wholesaler, this place has all the fresh ingridients needed, including toro, fatty tuna often hard to find in a smaller restaurant
Good friendly atomosphere and cozy ambiance makes it such a delight to be
The food and presentation is well balanced with the price
The restaurant has consistently given us the over-all worth for the money
The appetizers are always innovative
The dishes are exceptionally prepared and presenation is wonderful
A great place to eat sushi on the upper eastside
I was in Brooklyn to go to D'mai Urban Spa (check my review on that if you're interested
) and after going through Citysearch to find a restaurant nearby, I picked Mulino
I had a nice lunch there, but it's nothing to write home about
They have quite delicious bread and my salad was nice, but the gnocchi were a little bit heavy
good pomodoro sauce though
Still, it's not very expensive at all and it's decent Italian food
I just wouldn't go out of my way for it
My boyfriend and I were in Brooklyn suddenly we got hungry and asked to where we could find a place to have authentic Italian Meal
We were recommended Mulino's
As we walked in the resturant, a gentleman open the door to heaven
He sat us down, and was kind enough to inform us of the special of the day
He highly recommended Lobster Fradiabolo and Lamb Chops with Broccoli Di Rabe
We decide to take chance
After we were done with the meal, Giovanni told us of the very special dessert
We couldn't get enough of this place, everything was to our perfection
Now we tried the Pear Special, which was amazing
So to complete our meal he brought us a whole bottle of Sambuca on the house
We couldnt believe that a place such as this one existed
The expierence felt as if we were really in Italy
I've been to many Italian restaurants in Brooklyn, and I gotta say that a rare few come close what Mulino provides
The ambience is quite cozy and somewhat romantic
The service is attentive and friendly and the food is incredible
What's more amazing are the reasonable prices
Every ounce of delicious mouthfuls is worth every penny
I often go for the specials, but my all time favorie is the angel hair pasta with white clam sauce
This dish is tops and there isn't an Italian restaurant anywhere the cooks up this dish the way Mulino does
I go there at least once a week
I just can't get enough of this place
Mangia and Buon Apetit!!!
The food here is great and the prices aren't bad
The staff, though, is something else
We tried to order the earlybird prix fix and they charged us full-price

Both of us thoroughly enjoyed both appetizers and entrees
The escargot was amazing, the portabella appetizer was great, the steak frites was great and the crabcake was not only great but was very generous in portion
With a bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees +tax and 20% tip I left around $100
worth every penny for a great dining experience
Very enjoyable
Easy to get a table
Always greeted with a smile
The food is always fresh and delicious but I wish the menu would change more often
Good value
Service is usually great but sometimes I get that 1 waiter who forgets he's on duty
the maitre d' wore a fisherman's sweater warmly greeted us
this was just the start of a very memorable dinner
the fries are fresh and the mayonnaise is undoubtedly gourmet if not homemade
the onion soup was superb: quality gruyere cheese lots of onions, the way onion soup should be (unlike so many soups that have more bread vs
onions)
the rack of lamb practically melted w/each bite
and the lemon crepes were marvelous
everything - from the attentive service to the calm, sophisticated, simple atmosphere to the quality food - was first-rate
the prices are very reasonable
i will make sure all my friends come here
We went here with a large group
The restaurant is big, yet cozy
The service is fantastic, and the food matches
The she crab soup, the escargot, the entrees, all delicious
And affordable! It's casual french food at it's finest
because I'm afraid that my favorite restaurant will become too crowded for me! Cafe Loup is that rarest of places -- it has great food, reasonable prices, sweet but efficient staff, AND a comfortable, comforting ambience
It's my go-to place, whenever anyone asks me for a recommendation
Even vegetarians can find good choices here
And the desserts are great
unbelievable! excellent apps
, incredible margaritas (at a stuffy french place?) and killer service at a modest price
on my personal top 10 for manhattan list
Mullens is best described as your standard Irish bar in terms of setup; bar in front, tables and booths along the wall and in back
Everything else about Mullens is far more appealing than any of the other 'standards' in Chelsea
Drinks are cheap and well made by knowledgeable, friendly bartenders
The crowd is a mix of regulars, hipsters, travelers, young and old
The conversations are always entertaining and this bar has that vibe that makes you come back again and again
Its hip but not trendy
The food is good (not great) but certainly hits the spot if you find yourself here to enjoy any of the other already mentioned amenities
This is one of the few Pubs in the Chelsea area where you can seat eat and drink with the Bartender's and leaving there feeling lighter, the wonderful personalities of Ed and Patrick the Bartenders make it an experience that every tourist and local person she has at least once, but let me say if you go once you will return with more friends
When in NYC on business for the magazine, The Blondie Review, we stay at the Chelsea Savoy
The absolute best place to meet and eat, conduct our business and enjoy the atmosphere of the Chelsea district is at Mullens Pub
My special favorite is their Burgers, but their menu is loaded with other great foods
The service is good and the prices are reasonable
As far as I know, the bartender has never made a bad drink and the beer is ice cold

The Scene Though often called a "gay restaurant," East of Eighth caters to a diverse clientele, ranging from the flamboyant bar crowd to straight-laced retiree couples from the nearby apartment complexes coming by for the early-bird special
An extremely sociable staff makes everyone feel comfortable
The outdoor garden is open year-round (heated in winter)
The Food This international-eclectic menu includes some stellar standouts--most notably, well-made thin-crust mini-pizzas
The four-cheese version cleverly combines fresh and smoked mozzarella with goat cheese and Gorgonzola
Grilled firecracker wasabi shrimp with miso is a house favorite--a generous helping of piquant glazed shrimp surround a mound of basmati rice and snow peas
Most menu items, however, are standard variations on general American cuisine (meat loaf, chicken potpie, pork chops)
Portions are hearty and drinks are stiff
My boyfriend and I recently went to East of 8th for dinner on a Saturday night
We were seated at a nice, private table
The corn bread (among the several varieties in the bread basket) was delicious
Our waitress was very attentive and gladly helped us to make our food selection
We had all small plates, calamari, mussels, pot stickers, crab cakes, and an assortment of italian meats and cheese
They were all fantastic
We would definitely go back to East of 8th
We went to East Eighth based on the reviews here on citysearch and that it was close to a birthday party we were attending
Fist of all, the decor is awful
Everything about it screams cheap! The crowd was very unattractive as was the waitstaff
It took about ten minutes to get out drink ordering after sitting down and once we recieved the bottle our waitress never once refilled our glasses! The food was like grocery store food rehated
We ordered several of the small dishes for tasting and not one was tolerable, and each was worse than the next
We ordered dessert, since we had not eatten much of our dinner, and even the ice cream had that cheap frozen food section taste
Please don't go to this restaurant, it is a waste of time and money
There are so many better places to try in this city!!
I had dinner in the back garden here this weekend and liked the overall atmosphere
You wouldn't even know you were in Manhattan! The service was a little bit slow, but given the surroundings it wasn't a problem
Last but not least, the food was good and the white wines by the glass were nice
The food was delicious! And they had a fixed price menu that was a great deal! The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great!!!
Went here with a date after reading the great reviews given to this place by other users
What a disappoinment! Nothing special about the hush puppy sized crabcakes that tasted like something out of the box
My date had the pecan crusted salmon and I had the chicken pot pie entree
There was no amount of salt or pepper that you could put on the food to make it even tasty, it was totally bland
How can you screw up salmon?!? Great atmosphere and romantic but make sure you eat before you come here
The food is wonderful, the service is the best and the ambience is comfortable! One of the best kepts secrets!
AFforadable gourmet meal, that was a bit light on quantity
Pizza lacked appeal, although the description pulls you in
The title says it all
This unpretentious restaurant has a great menu and great service
Definitely worth trying
It's a standard brunch, but in a nice enough setting in a fun neighborhood
The all-inclusive price is just right! The various Benedicts are quite good
The service here was slow but very friendly and the food more than made up for it
A good deal for a lot of tasy Japanese food
Also, there are lots of non-sushi options (but the sushi is good too!)
The atmosphere is friendly, spacious, and upbeat
The brunch menu is a real steal, offering a free drink with your meal
I wouldn't order the cheapest steak, however - you get what you pay for there
The breakfast menu is reasonable and the food delicious
The staff is friendly and the service okay
The menu is ample but the environment non-greasy
i've always liked this place-- solid food, huge menu, nice atmosphere whether by yourself or with friends
Last night i ordered take-out from them and they messed up my order
I wasn't furious or anything-- it happens to everyone-- but i did go by today to tell the manager
He was so gracious
i didn't expect anything except we'll work on that, but he insisted on refunding my money

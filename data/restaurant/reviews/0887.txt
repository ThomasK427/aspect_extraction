Price for 2 was $66 with an appetizer, (2) glasses of wine and (2) entrees
not bad for NY
tribeca bread is quickly becoming one of my favorites
the ambiance is just fantastic with the open but intimate set-up
and the food is exquisite - from the pasta to the highly recommended grilled squid
one should go before it gets too crowded
The Scene A brightly painted mural and exposed kitchen lend this tiny space an airy feel
If you don't get a table, grab a seat at the counter, right next to the cherry-red Jesus figurine perched atop the soda fridge
Waiters are friendly and quick on their feet and seem to know half the clientele
The Food Shaped like pita bread, only thicker and made of corn, the arepas here are generously stuffed with a variety of fillings
Start simple, with black beans or one of three cheeses, then move on to something more adventurous, like portobello and tofu, or a zesty tuna salad
The standout is the delectable stewed meat and plantains, even tastier with a splash of homemade hot sauce
Deep-fried empanadas have fewer filling options, but are big enough for a meal
Save room for the tres leches cake, crowned with dollops of browned meringue
Arepas are always good and this place beats waiting for one from a dirty shack in a corner of Caracas
The are crunchy on the outside and yummy on the inside
The pabellon is the most popular with beans, plantain, shredded beef, chesse and i believe avocado (I can't believe they fit all that in such a little thing)
The sauce available at the table is good in it and is not too spicy but rather sweet
There are other arepas which are to die for
Chorizo with jalapenos
Soft cheese with avocado and plantains
Tomato, soft cheese and balsamico
Empanadas (turn-overs) have a crust too thick for my taste
They are worth trying though, specially the Cazone (baby shark)
Their juices are natural and great
Usually mixed (passion fruit and papaya, sugar cane and lemon)
The place is very small but they opened a bigger room next door and left the original place as take out
(I dont know about that, I got used to the place as it was)
Staff is very friendly
Almost everyone is from Venezuela
The owner is this hard working Venezuelan reporter who last I went in was expecting
Good luck to her and her child
Never been to Venezuela but this food is amazing, the arepas and cachapas are the best
service is ok but the food makes it up to you
The food is really good
I think cachapas w/guayanesa cheese is the best thing in the menu
Arepas are good but sometimes they're a little hard, which makes me think that there are not as fresh as they should be
I love Venezuelan food!
The food was pretty good (guacamole with fried plantain chips, arepas with pork, chorizo, eggplant, onions, etc
) and they had alot of really good beverages (rice and cinnamon drink, papaya juice, etc
) and the prices are very reasonable
There was a wait of 30 to 40 min on a Saturday night- the place can hold about 20 customers tops
Next time I'm just going to do take out instead
The waitress/hostess seemed a bit sad when we told her we weren't ordering dessert (those arepas are deceptively filling!)
The brunch is a great deal--eggs, beans, fresh salad, fried cheese, the best cafe con leche outside of south america, and fresh squeezed tropical fruit juice for $12! The coconut shakes are amazing, as are all the juices (like passionfruit and a strawberry/blackberry blend)
They've got the smallest tables I've ever seen, which actually aren't big enough to hold all the food, so you're engaged in a balancing act to figure out where to put down your glass
Friendly service, nice vibe
After recently coming back from a business trip from Venezuela, I decided to take my wife out to dinner to get her to try some of the wonderful food I had there
I took her to the Caracas arepa bar
Unfortunately, the treat for my wife became a mistreat
While the place is uncomfortably small, the service was just terrible
The waitress there had the kind of attitude that she deserves to get a penny for a tip
We had the pabellon criollo and some arepas
The beef on the pabellon was basically kind of dry and just didnt taste so good
The arepas were hard and did not feel so fresh
I just felt embarrassed as I tried to show my wife some of the great food I had in Venezuela
I will no go back there again!!
The place is tiny, so not good for big groups, but it's got great ambiance, we went there with a group of 4 and had a fantastic time
The food is delicious, and great to sample a bunch of different things
Highly recommend it, can't wait to go again!
This place is unbelievable
the food is really yummy, it taste like your mother was cooking all day long!!! We came in, and we waited about 20 minutes to be seated because it is a relly small space but our server came out every 5 minutes to tell us to be patience that a table was about to leave
When we sat down, I felt like we were in some place in Venezuela
the food was amazing, the atmosphere was really cool
and the prices were really great
If you enjoy good food and humble atmospheres
Caracas is the place!!!! Handmade food!!!
delicious arepas, great vibe, funkiest decor and the cutest owner in the universe
This is the real thing
they have real ingredients and their food is really fresh
no doubt about it
The cheeses are incredible
They can seat 20 people so try to go before or after rush hour
I've been to Caracas at least 10 times over the last year or so, and the food is always delicious
Great flavors, interesting specials and soups, plus they have a terrific $10 brunch special that covers many of the best dishes in one serving
I think the reviewers who complained about the wait for food should take another look at the size of their kitchen, it's microscopic
Makes sense that they would slow down when things get busy
However, I would agree about the service being somewhat lousy
If you're friends with the server then you'll be fine, but if you don't know them (like most people) they can be a bit slow as well as cold
Very un-Venezuelan
Although the place is super tiny and you'll have a hard time taking your coat off without knocking your neighbor in the head--it's so cozy and the food is so good! Come early enough not to have to wait outside for a table and bring at least 3 people so you can have the window seat! The chicha and cocada drinks are sooo yummy
The appetizers are better than the main arrepa dishes--loved them
Comfort food at it's finest
If you tend to eat healthfully, this is not the place for you
All of the food is fried and grease-laden
I ordered the fish Arepa thinking it'd be light but it too was drenched in oil
Also, don't go on a cold night
It's so small that you cannot wait indoors for a table so you must leave and come back and you'll be seated by the door (because all seats are by the door) or window and its freezing
And the bathroom has no heat
Pee before you go
This place is truely cosy
For some reason the place makes you feel at home
The food is great, especially the Arepas; They are AWESOME!
Encouraged by a couple of friends, today I went to this restaurant sure that I will at least eat some good latin food
but not only we have to wait more than 30 min in the cold to enter, we also have to deal with the rude attitude of the waitress, who as other people mentioned here: was nice only with the people that she already knew
We were always the last to be served and had to wait for more than 45 min for a pair of not so good empanadas
The arepas were not bad, but in general the food was not so fresh and the service deplorable
In conclusion: the waiting and the price we paid were not worthed
Putting a new spin on cozy, the tiny restaurant Caracas makes up for its studio-sized habitat with empanadas and arepas that will knock your culinary socks off
Tucked into an arepas lightly fried corn casing are the savory fillings of your choice, from the shredded beef, aged cheese, and black beans, and plantains of De Pabellon [incidentally this writers favorite] to the fresh avocado and chicken of The Pepi Queen

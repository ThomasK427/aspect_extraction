everything from the vegetables to the potatoes tasted perfect
Our server was slightly inattentive but very friendly
Overall, highly recommended for a date or a relaxing night out
Went on a Monday evening and although empty, ambiance was great
Felt like a quaint restaurant in Europe
Our waiter David was knowlegable, polite, attentive but not overbearing
Made us feel pampered without being intrusive
Porter- great as well, keeping our glasses full, table clean, food coming at the right intervals
Vitello Tonnato (a perfect balance of a tuna/mayonaise sauce, veal and capers) and Polenta with Porcini Mushrooms- a very surprising pleasure
We topped it off with Suckling Pig (charred on the outside-succulent, flavorful and juicy on the inside) and spaghetti w Lobster in a Cherry Tomato/Garlic sauce (fantastic!)
The whole experience-warm, fuzzy, arousing
Wine list is extensive
We were surprised by the variety of quality wines available from Sardinia
Our waiter topped us off with complimentary Grappa
If your looking for an authentic, country-style Sardinain/Italian meal in a warm/relaxed and casual space, Assenzio is perfect
Good music, too!
I was really excited to try this place after the high Citysearch ratings and great reviews, but I have to confess, I was sorely disappointed
When we arrived on a Thursday night w/o a reservation we were seated right away The host was from Milan and was very friendly
However, our waitress was MIA most of the night and kept forgetting things so we had to keep asking the host to find her
Wine selection was not the best - they serve only Sardinian wines which were not Italy's finest in this case
Between my friends, we tried the sea bass, the seafood ravioli and the steak, none of which were very good - very bland and lacking in a distinct flavor
This place is ok if you live in the neighborhood, but if you're looking for noteworthly Italian, this is not the place for you
This place was amazing
When we showed up (without reservations) they told us it would be about a 20 minute wait-- not bad on a Saturday night
Ten minutes later we were informed it would be a little longer and they brought us (party of 4) glasses of champagne as an apology since the bar was packed
An unbelievable meal followed (highpoints: extremely fresh jumbo shrimp, to-die-for olive oil/rosemary/nutmeg 'dip,' tender wild boar with juniper berries, a wonderfully creamy tiramisu, orgasm worthy chocolate mousse)
They even brought out complementary glasses of dessert wine
Service was comparable to Grammercy Tavern (except think half the price)
By the end of the meal, we were shaking hands with/hugging our waiter as we stumbled/rolled out the door
Everyone in our party rated this as a top three (at least) all-time meal
But please, don't go
We've decided we don't want to share
I don't even know what to say about this place
everything was perfect and I mean PERFECT!!!!!!!!!! mouth watering food, attentive service, seductive music, homey atmosphere
thanks
you make me feel like dancing
The atmosphere is great, the decor unique, and the food will make you lick your plate! No kidding, I really love this Sardinian East Village jewel
True, sometimes it gets busy, but start a bottle, and be merry :) or just go next door, there are other great places near by
We went to Assenzio a saturday for the first time with a party of six and since we stepped in we've been pampered from all the staff, always attentive and smiling; even if the place was quite crowded they let us stay to enjoy our afterdinner drinks and the owner even sat with us for a tour trough grappas, he explained us the differences between aquavit and grappa and also the origins of the Sardinian filiferu aquavit
This is a real dining experience, not just a place you go to stuff yourself with overcooked pasta while they rush you out
Way more than food!
It was my first time there and I was a little concerned about the vibe; it seemed that everybody knew each other for a long time and I was worried to be forgotten in a corner but after a few minutes I was one of them
They made us feel like at a high school reunion (but only with the cool people from high school, no nerds
) Food was really good, fresh and not boring like other Italians, nicely presented and prepared with quality ingredients
I have to go back!
I've never been to a restaurant with a staff that was so rude and unaccomodating
Arriving on time with a reservation, I was asked to wait until a table became available
I was told by the hostess that a specific table would be mine once the customers left and I waited 45 minutes for that to happen
I was then told that the table was going to another party and I would have to continue to wait
My group informed the hostess and unapologetic manager that we were leaving, and got only a rude shrug in return
Unless you are fluent in Italian and discover you are a long lost relative of the staff, I don't recommend going here!
My group of 5 had a 9 PM dinner reservation, and after waiting an hour, we still hadn't been seated
The worst part was that the hostess kept telling us that our table was almost free and that we were just about to be seated, but after an hour, she finally admitted that they were overbooked and that she didn't have a table for us and didn't know when we would be able to sit down
The manager was incredibly rude, unprofessional, and unapologetic and we finally had to walk out
I wouldn't come here again if it were the last place open in NYC
i had the short ribs which were ok
the papardella and the gnocchi were excellent
I started going to Assenzio several month ago and at the beginning I was going there for the incredibly good food and the relaxed mood, but lately I found myself going to Assenzio just to talk to him
I don't know his name but he makes me feel like I am flying (and he has beautiful nipples
)
I love you Assenzio!
the owners are the nicest people ever, good wine list, good food, generous portion, great ambience, comfy,
best of all, I went with a friend, and though there were just two of us, they let us sit at a table for four people; I hate when I get cramped into claustrophobic tiny weeny tables,
Will definitely go back!!!
The food was wonderful
No silly 'vinagrette' or whatever
Lemon/oliv oil the way it should be
Service was attentive, helpful and friendly
Its a bit noisy and tight, but that should be expected
But, I really don't have anything negative to say at all
I definitely intend to come again
This place is such a find
Just walking around on an early spring day, my girlfriend and I started to review the local places' menu and found Assenzio
The ambience is very typical of trendy restaurants yet highly comfortable and you already think about coming back just to relax
The wine list is adequate and slightly above moderately priced
Order a bottle when dining with a group of four
The menu is varied enough for anyone palette with a slight inclination for Italian
The dessert are a bit average but after your meal, you will barely have enough room for it
Walking down east fourth street one cold evening, my mother and I stumbled upon this adorable restaurant, and felt as though we were transported to Italy
The tuna carpaccio seemed as though the fish had been caught two minutes before, and the bufalo mozzarella was the best I've had in the city
Our entrees - the pappardelle with mushrooms and truffle oil, and the branzino -- were equally amazing
Our charming and extremely friendly waiter topped off the whole experience, and as much as we want to keep it our secret, it was too great to do so
The only negative aspect was that, for some reason, the place was extremely cold
Nevertheless, two thumbs up!
Went for lunch after Asimov's positive review in the Times
I love Italian and expected to be impressed
The space is great
Perfect for the block
Unpretentious, inviting, cute
The food was very disappointing
Vitello Tonnato appetizer had no taste and apparently no Tonnato
Felt like I was eating turkey breast with mayo
Pasta main was black linguini with cherry tomato and calamari
Way, way overdone paste and rubbery squid ruined the whole dish
To be fair, I realize I was there for lunch and that the food is probbably better at dinner service when a full kitchen staff has arrived and prepped, but I doubt I'd return to find out with so many other options in the neighborhood i already trust
Finally an Italian Enoteca like the ones you could only find in Tuscany, try the cheese selection with honey and a nice glass of sardinian wine
I was blown away by the Pumpkin soup served with toasted pecans! This place was great, I had dinner with friends of various diet requirments and all found something to love about dinner at Pulse! The menu is varied, as is the selection of wines and Microbrews
And everything looks really cool on the plate
Our server and her team worked together like they had been doing this for years and all the while with smiles on their faces
The lighted ice rail in the bar tied in the majesty of the view of Rockefeller Center's ice rink out the window

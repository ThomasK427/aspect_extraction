It was so crowded though people at the bar and the bar so small people were basically standing right over us which was annoying
I dont need to see people staring at us eat wondering what we got
Mind your own freakin business and order a drink
Service was pretty slow when I needed a new drink
Can someone turn on the air conditioning so I dont feel like a purdue turkey in an oven on thanksgiving ?
After hearing so much about the Bond St
, I finally got a chance to experience the buzz
What I found out was that my wife and I had been there when it was under construction
The sushi was excellent
I had not had sushi that melt in my mouth for a while
It was definitely a very romatic place and a place for people-watching
I will come back again and again for the sushi; however, the appetitizers were just so so
I was not so impressed by the decoration
Nice leather sofa, but so what
Mega has better design
Only if Bond St
had Sapa's interior design, or Sapa had Bond St
's food
Amazing sushi (the best tuna sashimi), cocktails and ambience
I recommend this place for dates, dinner with friends, anything!
the food was average at best and the service was far worse
My date and i left hungry
my boyfriend took me there for a fancy birthday dinner and it was really yummy! the risotto appetizer was REALLY good and the sea bass entree was pretty yummy too
the sushi was ok
i wasn't that impressed
we got 2 rolls - lobster tempura which i wouldn't go for again, and the shrimp roll with some kind of curry sauce
that was good
i would get the shrimp one again
anyways, i would definitely go back - but for a special occasion cause it's kinda pricey (as expected)
I took my girlfriend here for my birthday and we had a great time
Sushi was great and so was the service
The Soft Shell Crab Roll and Lobster Tempura are awesome
I would definetly recommend for a date
Price was not too bad, especially for a restaurant of this level
Obviously if cost is your main concern, then you'll probably spend more time on your calculator watch adding up your dishes than enjoying the meal
On the other hand, if you want expensive and overpriced, go to MEGU
Bond street, after so many years is still NOT passe' and offers a fun atmosphere, excellent menu and staff (both here and Miami)
The crowd, often a nouveau riche/eurotrash Wall Street blend, has lost its luster (as well as some of the interior) but overall it's still a great environment for date or small groups
Absolute total waste of extra money
If you feel like paying extra for them to turn the lights down and give you a rock to put your sticks on - then go
However, if you're going out for good sushi, just remember that for the most part, it really just gets more expensive
The quality is not remarkably different
Go to Yama
Bond Street has become the yard stick by which I measure all other restaurants, sushi or otherwise
The ambiance and atmosphere are great
If you are going for a romantic dinner, try the second floor dining area
If youd like a bit more fun, sit at the sushi bar
The sushi chefs have interesting personalities, interact quite a bit and seem to enjoy their work
The service has just the right balance of attentiveness and discreetness
When you find that your sake glass has been filled and you didnt notice the waiter doing it, you know the staff has been well trained
And, the sushi is unmatched anywhere
Really
Surprisingly, the non-sushi items are also superb
The ume-soba is wonderful, the Chilean sea bass is done just right, and the filet is great
If you are getting a bottle of sake, Id recommend the Maebo; one of my favorite sakes
We tried the chef's tasting menu that was perfect
Perfect blend of flavors, perfect portions, and perfect presentation
A+ for the food but the wait staffs need to educate themselves better
bond street sushi is not worth the high price you pay to eat there
don't go there if you are hungary cause the portions are minute
if you have a special roll to your liking that you would like to order forget about it cause they will not make it for you
the ambiance was great but thats all bond street sushi had to offer
I've tried many highly-rated sushi places and this one is the best
However, I haven't been to Nobu so perhaps Bondst
is second place
I'm not sure if it's #1 but the sushi is delicious, fresh, and comes paired with wonderful, exotic sauces, which combinations are clearly well thought-out and executed
Went to Bond St
on a Monday night to try the sushi
Upon seating, was very rushed by the waitress
Tried the Omakase menu sashimi and although the fish was good, the portions were pitiful
Been to Nobu and Blue Ribbon many times and have always left full and extremely satisfied
left Bond St
and wanted to go to Wendy's (ended up at Magnolia Bakery
) Especially disappointing was the otoro
All in all, this place is a joke
DON'T BOTHER
too many other good Japanese restaurants in NYC
I have a few well heeled friends that frequent all of the best that NYC has to offer
Il Mulino, Nobu, Etc
and they were right
I was told to prepare for an outstanding sushi experience and this place was a can't miss
The staff and ambiance were understated, yet gorgeous
The front door staff was courteous and treated my party with more attention than I expect, and of course the sushi was second to none
I can now go to Nobu for the entrees and save my sushi jones for Bond St
It was somewhere between our waiter not knowing what sushi came as part of the tasting platter and the copious amounts of wine that he spilt while trying to pour me a taste that I realized
the service here? not so great
This was followed by various wacky hijinks: overly sweet foie de gras, lack of extra ginger/soy sauce, minute portions even for sushi, appetizers arriving at different times
I could go on, but reliving the experience traumatizes me
just say no
Well, this place was one of the selections for the girls' and I monthly G
N
O dinner
but it sort of sux that we wanted pizza after dining here
(well most of us) i guess if you're Cameron Diaz, a Supermodel, or simply watching your weight, then it's the place for you
But if you're a normal eater, well just pack a sub or something in your purse
The good thing is that it never fails to come up in conversation when we are all together so although, we were empty in the bellie, our mouths are full of talk about how hungry we were
the sushi was good and the service was not as bad as some would have you think but the crowd was more business than hip, more wall st
than style
big tables in the corner were great for six of us
Definately one of the best sushi restaurants in NYC

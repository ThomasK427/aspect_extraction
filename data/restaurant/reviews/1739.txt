The food was average, but the portions, or should I say rations, would be scoffed at by even the most famished of man
My lamb chop looked like a spec upon its plate; its size tantamount to an appetizer anywhere else
While we all like to be served and doted on attended to by knowledgeable and friendly staff, lets not forget the deep underlying reason we all go out to eat is to satiate our hunger-which Eleven Madison failed to do[/p]   As beautiful as the high ceilings and other features may have been, at a restaurant, one is paying for their stomach to be satisfied, not just their eyes
In order to compensate for the paltry offerings, we were bombarded w/ small deserts and treats throughout the meal, including a rum cake when we were exiting-perhaps a desperate attempt by the management to retain customers they had just robbed?   Eleven Madison would be ideal for a dieter-but anyone w/ a least a fraction of a normal human appetite will leave wanting more
I left feeling cheated-my wallet was empty, and so was my stomach
Anybody giving this place a favorable review probably either was dispatched by the restaurant or were duped into thinking scant servings on fancy dishes and a tasty parting gift are worthy replacements of a filling meal
After my experience at Eleven Madison, I felt it was my duty and obligation to warn any potential diners to take their business elsewhere
Lastly, before I draw scorn from EM apologists in realizing that this review sounds like the ravings of a fat man (no offence to the overweight), Id like to add that Im only 140 pounds with my keys in my pocket
The food was very good, although definitely not close to the best I've had
The savory was better than the sweet
Service was, again, very good but not excellent
The portions ARE small, so if you are looking for a hearty meal, look elsewhere
but true foodies should try once, on someone else's dime
Wish I had been able to try tasting menu - but one of our party was not having it
Great ambiance
I went last night with a friend from out of town
I had read a great review in Time Out and decided to give it a shot
Well, that review lived up to everything it said
A meal here is not for those in a rush, or for those who don't like to ask questions of their waiter when they don't know what something is on the menu (I did it a lot)
The menu is honestly, a little much, but our server (Allison) was amazing and the overall service impeccable
The food was wonderful and the serving sizes and pacing, about perfect
I was taken there for dinner as a treat for my MA graduation from my mother, who was visiting from Europe
I expected the price to be high, so I am not complaining about that per se
However, the food was horrific
We were going to have the duck, but they had ran out of it I guess that night
So, we ended up ordering two main dishes, which we could not even finish (not because of proportions, but because of taste)
The food is too eclectic and even more eccentric
Definitely not a restaurant for someone who is hungry
The service was impeccable, no complaints about that
Finally, the deserts were really great
Nice atmosphere too
So, basically, the food is just way too extreme taste-wise
In general, an okay restaurant
Wish I had gone elsewhere, really
My fianc wanted to treat me for my B-day, so I gave her two options, either The Tasting Room or Eleven Madison Park (EMP)
Because of TimeOut NY's review she chose EMP, and although it set her back about $300, I'm sure she hasn't regretted it
We had a 6+ course tasting menu
Everything was fabulous! We chose the Spring (veggie) tasting menu, but it also has a Winter and Summer
The dullest dish we had was gnocchi with some specialty mushrooms, and that was still great
The novelty of the tastes were beyond my ability to remember them
Many meals were delivered by two servers, besides having a waiter to oversea the process
On the way out, someone grabbed my girlfriend to give her a small complimentary cake
Pretty boring place - just over-priced without any flare to show for it
We didn't expect much and didn't get much - ture to the reviews
It appears anyone can walk in off the street and get a job as waitor/waitress
All in all - save your money and have better veiws and service at the Shake Shack across the street in Madison Square Park
Went there for Valenties Day with my boyfriend who flew down to take me to dinner
Shocked that they were out of all of the seafood dishes except for the scallops- no tuna tartare, no lobster, a complete disappointment
From such a high end restraunt I would expect them to be prepared for such a day
Only consulation was my esspresso martini and my boyfriend
Went during restaurant week
Got pasta appetizer that was very good
Then got risotto w/wild mushroom, cippollini onion, and slivers of soft cheese
It was beautiful! I also tried my friend's braised short rib - also sublime
Desserts were good but not phenomenal
Atmosphere is nice, but bit formal feeling perhaps due to architecture of building itself, which has an office/bank feel to it
I used to work in the building it is in and would go there often for lunch, so I never really thought of it as a dining option
I recently was there for New Year's - not a favorite time to eat out, but it was one of the few places that did not have a special menu and restricted seating times
It was a delightful experience and we had a wonderful meal to boot
I can only imagine what it is like on a regular night
I would certainly go back anytime- especially on New Year's Eve
11 Madison was actually better than I expected and I had heard good things about it
The place was overly crowded, the seating was very comfortable and the room was very interesting as well
I thought the service was a bit much, but I guess that's what you get in a place like that
On to the food
I was very impressed
The menu was interesting and very well prepared and they made a good margarita, always a good test
I would recommend 11 Madison pretty much anytime, though the romance factor wasn't through the roof
Aside from the attractive dining room, there is no reason to bother with this restaurant
Judging from my experience on Sunday, August 14, 2005, food was merely average, and the beef for two arrived cold
Wait staff paid little attention to the progress of our meal, seemingly distracted and simply disinterested
Our server never bothered to inquire as to whether or not we wanted coffee
a totally unforgiveable mistake
When spending 200 dollars on dinner for two, a standard of service and quality beyond that of any Manhattan corner diner is requisite
Shame on Eleven Madison Park
Celebrated my birthday at 11 Madison Park and throughly enjoyed the experience
The food was amazing and was complimented by the best service I have ever experienced
The only thing missing from this experience was more room in my stomach
I highly recommend 11 Madison Park
Remember to save room for the tastiest and sexiest desserts I have ever had
My boyfriend and I went during restuarant week
The service started out decent but once our entree's came and our wine glasses were empty, we were not asked if we wanted more wine
Also, our water glasses were empty for about 15 minutes and we had to ask twice for more water before getting some
The food was pretty good but the service not so much
I expected more for a restaurant like this
We won't be back for a long time
If a restaurant offers three courses with three plates each, make sure your party is no more or less than three people and order everything
Adopt the 30 second rule and coyly slide around the dishes
After everyone has tasted everything then you have the option to keep or trade back a plate you would like to finish
Viola, you successfully will have tasted everything the kitchen has to throw at your fiscal palette during restaurant week
It was a Thursday night and our 10 PM reso was seated promptly
Our excellent server Leo was able to hold banter with my chatty party
No black linen available so dress accordingly
Every dish was served in a timely fashion
The back waiters cleared the table with precision
Presentation and quality was excellent
I finished the evening at the bar with a most excellent Makers Manhattan Up
Thank you Tom
I dined at Eleven Madison Park with my boyfriend last night and I was very disappointed with our experience
Yes, the food is delightful, with bold, complementary flavors

The only complaint I might have is that the staff is very friendly with each other and while not all bad they tend to forget theyre waiting on people
My beer was empty for 6 minutes
I found the restaurant to be inviting though with the pictures of dogs all about and the decor and lighting to be very pleasing
The bartender seemed to be in very good spirits and was happily chatting with the locals at the bar
If youre staying at Affina Dumont hotel this place is convenient
I am a relatively easy-going customer, yet by far, this was THE WORST dining experience I have ever had in New York City, hands down! The waitstaff was negligent, incomptent, and worse yet -- RUDE
It took us a half hour to get menus, and then the owner kept running over to bring us things we hadn't even ordered -- and then tried to CHARGE us for them
All the customers around us were miserbale too -- getting the wrong food getting it late
Someone at a nearby table stopped over at our table to confide, Is this not the worst service you've ever experienced?
and we could not agree more! When we mentioned our concerns to the owner he was smug, arrogant and disrespectful beyond belief
I am a dog lover but a Barking Dog hater for life!
You would think a place called Barking Dog would allow dogs in the restaurant, but of course not
what a gimmick! most restaurants with outdoor space will allow your dog to sit with you outdoors anyway
i guess dog friendly to them just means they will allow your dog to sit next to the table
The hostess or waitress was very rude when she told us no dogs were allowed
food was terrible! waitress had no expression and kept forgetting to bring sugar, ketchup, etc
AVOID THIS PLACE!
I think this is the cutest place! I am not even a dog lover, but the dog pictures all over the resturant give the place such charm
The pancakes are so yummy! I have only been there for brunch, but it is delish!
What ever happened to service with a small? and can they handle groups over 6? The seemed from teh get go, unaccomedationg, subborn, and unfriendly
The hostess did not even hand us menus
The bus boy had to bring them over and he put a stack on the table
Overall gave a bad vibe for the ambiance
Would not return, bad impression
A real surprise in a neighborhood full of standard NY resturants the Barking Dog stands out
Jason the bartender is friendly and can direct you to the evenings specials don't miss the toasted ravioli
John and Lisa the owners are extremmely pleasent and make you feel welcome
The place has the trending edge of a hot NY resturant coupled with service and reasonable prices
We ordered the fried chicken (so disappointing, batter is bad, not even crispy!) and fish chips (so-so)
Waiter never came by to even check up on us
Onion rings were decent though (different batter from fried chicken batter)
Barking Dog will have a corner where you'll feel welcome
The food is good ol' comfort food: tasty, eclectic, and abundant
The attractive wait/barstaff will extend VIP treatment, yet the place is casual enough for you to have breakfast as you would at a diner
The manager is very attentive and well-versed
The owners, a couple, are at hand frequently enough
If you choose to hang out just for drinks, you'll find laughs at the bar
If you bring guests, the decor inspires plenty of conversation
If your date happens to be a dog (the 4-legged kind!), their outdoor cafe comes complete with dog bar (read: water dishes) for different heights and lapping capacities
The portions, sometimes too overwhelming, will no doubt ensure that you'll have to take home, dare I say
a doggie bag!   I am a Murray Hill resident and dog owner
We needed this place!
the greatest expresso and gourmet chocolate
setting in a five star hotel-le parker meriden lobby
fast service while you can browse wonderfull gifts
set up for fast,fast take out service
I happend to come across this great little secret place while passing through the beautiful / trendy Parker Meridien hotel lobby
The epresso I drank was absolutely the best I've ever had
I didn't want to write about this place, because I don't want this spot to become to popular so I can have it all to myself, but the owner is such a nice guy, I thought I would do my part in spreading the word
The state of espresso drinks in this city is sad indeed
It's not just inconsistant finished product (often not hot enough) and consistant mediocre flavor of the drinks at you know where but everyone making espresso drinks in the chain stores seem to think lattes areespresso o laits with no foam(caps and lattes both have foam-it's the proportion that differs)
I can't convey the joy when I found this little gem of a coffee bar in the lobby of the Meridienne Hotel
Espresso with real flavor(not overroasted) and Lattes made with the right mix of milk and foam and the price no higher than Starborings
Their staff is a joy and they also sell interesting hard to find products/gifts in their shop
Stand-up only but perfect for take out
The Scene Inside the small, streamlined space--with its rough-hewn wood paneling, low candlelight and cushioned stools by the back bar--you'll find this sweet Clinton Street restaurant
Dining choices range from three-course, ingredient-themed tasting menus or a regular, seasonal a la carte menu
Chubo lets you reserve ahead, making the long banquettes and young, fun vibe ideal for large parties and first dates
Service tries to keep up with the quick-paced kitchen
The Food The international menu combines Asian, European and New World flavors
Hits include starters like tender, pepper-flecked squid with carrot and ginger; simple honey-mustard jicama; and rich duck phyllo rolls balanced with sweet plum drizzles
Entrees include rich goat cheese-mushroom shumai; miso chicken breast with gnocchi; and London broil with onion marmalade
Among desserts, the luscious green-tea panna cotta and miniature chocolate molten cake with homemade ice cream are winners
Chubo is one of those amazing culinary gems
I've been hear on numerous occassions and am always impressed by the service, the food, and the overall ambiance
The seasonal, rotating menu is always inventive but just incredibly good! The space is intimate and charming and the prices are very reasonable
I've never had a bad experience
Went there Fri night with reservations
Very attentive service
Calamari appertizer is subperb, just the right portion and WOW tastes
Squab was great
Partner has veggie dish, was totally blown away by it
Very calm vibe
Not following the regular LES pretentious trend at all
Highly recommended
They phoned me to confirm my registration, giving only a 2 hour confirmation window, subsequently cancelling my reservation
They over booked and dealt with it poorly
The title of this is about the dessert, but overall, this was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in the Village
Every dish presented a new taste and a creative combination of flavors
We've had their 4-course March special, Duck Duck Duck, which as the name suggests, had 3 duck courses followed by dessert
The foie gras sashimi, duck ravioli, and duck breast were all delicious and beautifully presented
But the best part was the dessert, the zucchini pancake with red bean paste, topped with spicy icecream was one of the most amazing tastes to mark my palate
And did I mention the coffee comes in individual french presses? I can't believe I haven't heard of this place much earlier
The food is below average, the price is sky high
Service is average, this restaurant doesn't even worth a try
Through a friend's recommendation my husband and I dined at Chubo
Well I must flair, this is a fantastic little restaurant
Our food was delicious, good service and by New York standard pricing, modest
A true find!  In these days of over stylized, over hyped mega restaurants it's comfort in knowing that restaurants like Chubo are open for buisiness
We were thrilled to try Chubo after reading good reviews and looking at its eclectic menu
We started by ordering wine by the glass, but were unpleasantly surprised when the amount served was equal to that of a tasting
The food was very complex; a hodge-podge of many cuisines
So complex, in fact, that it wasn't very good
Ground chicken mixed with escargot pushed into a an olive-oiled ravioli and topped with green beans? Come on
My wife's salmon was excellent, but my duck was lacking in both flavor and portion size
Dessert was tasty; the espresso was burned
Having only one server (and no busboy) for the whole restaurant slowed things considerably, but, not surprisingly, the space was only half full and she only had to handle one table turn anyway
went on a fri night without reservations and they accommodated us
they told us up front that they were expecting a large party and that we would have to leave by 9pm, which was fine since it was only 630p at that time
the 3-course prix fix is a great deal

Bland, tasteless, and lifeless
The avoacado salad was swimming in a pool of otherwise tasty ginger carrot dressing
The Tofu Mushroom Galore taste like a bad mix of sauce and veggies The traditional hot stone bowl (roots and greens) tasted funny like leftovers trash
Service was poor, seemingly they can't wait to get rid of you so they can seat more people
Also it takes forever to get your water refilled
It is sad to see an upscale restaurant stoop so low
My only concern is for the management to take vital steps to revive its glory
I'm not a huge fan of vegeterian Korean dishes, but being the picky eater I am I went neways (heard good reviews from my friends)
And I was very happy to see the REAL traditional Korean setting, real Korean food, and good service
And most of all, despite what my other friends told me, I though the portion was more than enough (had the lunch prix fixe)
But be aware; if you don't know a thing about Korean food don't just go there and think you know what you're ordering!! Bring your Korean friend
Rah rah Hangawi ;D
God I hope celebrities don't discover this one
amazing food
don't remember what is was, but it was the prixe fixe/special
every vegetarian bite tasted fantastic and, strangely, not so Korean
Firstly, all credits go to the kitchen staff who made my dining experience an extra ordinary one
The presentation as well as the taste of food was amazing
I would say Hangawi presents one of the most unique dining experience in NYC
However, to my dismay, the staff are somehow pretentious in welcoming you
Their screams of *Good evening, welcome to hangawi* could be heard even when I was seated at the back of the restaurant
The hostess was over eager and somehow unprofessional
I would highly recommend this place for it's food if you can sit there and be amazed at the side show
It was lovely dinner experience from the start to finish! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, knew the menu really well, and made great suggestion
I am not a vegetarian, but since my friend was and we were both IMPRESSED! I have eaten @ numerous vegetarian restaurants in the City and out but this place is definately THE BEST!!! You can't believe they are all veggies!!! lol
Been here a handful of times, and I've never been disappointed
I can always bring any of my non-vegetarian friends and they'll be amazed
The best bet is to go during holidays when they have a pre-fixe meal plan
It's the best bang for your buck
I went there twice and have to say that it is amazing
The creativity in treating vegetables is unbelievable
I never thought that cucumber and persimone and pumpking salad stuffed in persimones could work
i couldn't even imagine such a combination
But it works, and works beautifully
wonderful
For what you pay, the service should really be more attentive
This space isn't for everyone - you sit on the floor with your feet in a hole so people walk by you while you eat
Also, you take your shoes off (They do have bathroom slippers though that are quite nice - I'd love a pair)
The food is very light so I wouldn't suggest this venue if you'd also like to drink alot - because it's not filling for a long period of time
But, the food is very good and presented very beautifully
My date and I quite enjoyed munching on radish butterflies
All in all, I quite enjoyed myself because it was something different and I had felt like I left New York if only for a few hours
VERY EXPENSIVE THE WAITERS WERE OBNOXIOUS
Slow Service
The Restaurant is Overrated
Our dinner for 2 people came to $ 150
We gave a 15% tip but the waiters were greedy, pushy argued for a 20% tip which ruined the whole evening
Despite the fact that I am not a vegetarian, I do enjoy vegetarian fare from time to time
This was not one of them
We each had the emperor's meal with steamboat soup
The porridge (black sesame) was bizarre, too funky for me to finish
A few of the appetizers were unusual but nice
I had a todok root entree which was okay but nothing special
The steamboat soup was bland and disappointing
Nice quiet atmosphere, but the quality of the food doesn't justify the high price
Amazing restaurant! The food is to die for (especially the mango pear salad!) and the setting is out of this world
I was in NYC for three days and ended up eating here twice
I WILL be back again and again and again
From the moment I took off my shoes and padded over to my sunken table, I felt like I was anywhere but noisy NYC
The food was unique, delicious, and portioned so that you can try a bit of everything
A bit expensive, but worth it
I was very impressed by the whole experience they provided
To explain how good this place is, this is my first review posting
ever ! Your taste buds will be dancing to finely tuned and well timed meals which will (in our case) stop all conversation
As one must take time out to savour the flavour in peace
And the Birthday treatment here, is a unique experience ;)
Hangawi is the best vegetarian restaurant in New York
The receptionists and waiters and waitresses are very accommodating
The food is great
The place is neat and I feel like it's a temple, so serene it feels like you are on a pilgrimage to a sanctuary
This was truly a dining experience
The service was amazing, which says a lot in a city noted for horrible service
The food was tasty and the textures perfect
The variety of foods was fun
especially the mango pear salad
I was there with my boyfriend and it was great for a date
There were also tables with friends and large groups, and the restaurant was an ideal setting for all the group types
This was a great dining experience
Everything was so tasty and diverse; the service was fast, pleasant, and accomidating
We shared the Emporer's meal, and the food seemed to never end
When you think it's over, a delicious lemon-tofu pudding sprinkled with pine nuts
(the only complaint was the soup
it was very thick and a tad bland) Whether a vegetarian or not, you will love it
the purported serene, spiritual, buddhist experience hangawi sells you at around $18 per dish is both offensive and completely contrary to what buddhism is truly about
their asian accents such as candles with buddhist scripture and asian relics (vases, paintings, pillows, etc
) are the type urban outfitters would buy from chinatown and resell at 800%
this is serenity in a box with a hefty pricetag
the food? i don't know why they bother to call it korean food, because it was thoroughly gringofied
i'm part korean and i've never heard of many of these dishes
their kimchee was mild beyond recognition and i've never heard of koreans using so much sugar in their cooking! granted, the waitservice was thoroughly subservient, but the kneeling female in her traditional garb reminded me of geishas, etc
however, could've forgiven all transgressions of orientalism if the food was at least tasty
a unique dining experience - a chance to see a different side of Korean cuisine
beautiful setting and attentive service enhances the gorgeous vegetarian dishes
this restaurant couldnt get any better! i mean the food is delicious, service good
i mean what better could there be in any of this! me and my friends usually like to spend an evening together, and we usually go out to eat, most places are what we like to call OK restaurants, but this one was EXTRODINARY!!
This is definitely a special-occassion restaurant
It ain't cheap
But, I've been here several times and it's always been a pleasant experience
The atmosphere is peaceful and the waitstaff is congenial and attentive
This is a Korean restaurant in name, but it's not like any Korean food you've had elsewhere

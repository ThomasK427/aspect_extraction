Whether you are eating a piece of tofu tuna, a piece of salmon tomato, a piece of tuna karpachio, a piece of chopped eel and avocado, a piece of sauteed scallop, a piece of salmon miso, a piece of toro with wasabi sauce or even a piece of seared salmon, every peice you eat has something special that you can't find anywhere else
It's worth the relatively high prices for the best fish in town
Although, getting a couple of rolls and only 3 or 4 peices is the way to enjoy gari on a relatively economical budget
I guarantee you'll love it, but beware you really won't enjoy regular sushi anymore!!
Gari makes some of the best new wave sushi concotions I have ever had, and like all top tier sushi digs, it's fish are fresh, with the exception of Blue Ribbon Sushi and Sugiyama, it must be the best in the city
I've been to a few of the top sushi places in nyc, and this one, like all the others, had sushi which was incredibly fresh
For me though, what distinguished this place from the others was the almost unbelievable selection contained in the sushi special platter for approximately $36
This platter contained 10 pieces of sushi, plus one special roll of the chef's choice
Considering the variety of sushi (not only the types of fish, but preparation), the price was well worth it
Many of the sushi pieces were prepared in such a way that they turned seemingly normal sushi ingredients into something completely different
Example -- one piece of sushi in the platter was actually a piece of marinated/grilled eggplant -- easily the best eggplant concoction i had ever tasted
All pieces were equally strange and good
I highly recommend this place to any hardcore sushi lover
We heard about Gari Sushi from a few of our friends and did not make reservations on a weekday
We waited an hour and fifteen minutes before being seated
The waitress told us it was a ten minute wait
But the Sushi from the chef's special was exquisite
The texture and unique taste will make you come back for more
The ambiance was somewhat impaired by the tight quarters, but with the quality of the food made it a worthwhile experience
We thought the sushi was excellent but next time we will make reservations
Sushi is fresh and innovative
Sit at the sushi bar if possible for the Omakase (chef's choice)
who clearly knows very little about sushi
Gari offers the most beautiful, pristine and original sushi creations in the city
His sushi is also 100% traditional - one bite-sized piece - not the utterly ridiculous made-for-stupid-new-yorkers monster-sized pieces of Tomoe and Yama
As to the fact that everyone else's sushi looked better: the waitresses are not responsible for offering you what is CLEARLY written on the menu as Omakase - Chef's Choice
The only wannabe at Gari's that night was YOU - a wannabe food critic
I went for the first time and ordered the sushi that I usually order at other restaurants
The fish was fresh (like at every other good sushi place), but the portions were alot smaller and more expensive than places like Yama or Tomoe
Everyone around me was eating stuff that wasn't on the menu and looked tastier, but the waitress didn't bother to suggest any of these things, even when asked for suggestions
This forced exclusivity is really tacky -- this isn't Hollywood! The crowd was very white and heavily investment-banker/trust-fund-baby wannabe
Best sushi in NYC, period
For both traditional and creative sushi, this is the place to go
This is my favorite restaurant in the area, by far
The waiters are wonderful and even take the time to get to know you
Everything on the menu is wonderful
My only problem is that the gnocchi is so good, I can't seem to order anything else! The bread and dipping sauce they provide is amazing
A must if you are in the area
One of my favorites in the area -- fantastic Italian food that's not expensive at all
It's dimly lit, and would be really romantic (if it wasn't so crowded)
In the summer, you can ask to be seated outside, and even if it there's no particular view, it's tons of fun
The waiters and waitresses are always attentive
Personal favorite: the gnocchi
The only downside is the wait: expect to spend at least 20 minutes in line!
the food is simple and incredible tasting
the iced tea and wine list are delightful
with the exception of one slightly aloof but still efficient and civil waiter, the service is extraordinarily friendly
in fact, max has some of the best waiters around, especially the two guys from colombia--they rock! since i discovered it a few months ago, i've gone there to eat twice a week and can't think of a single bad thing to say about it
the bohemian atmosphere and non-servile staff might rub certain khaki-wearing family types with children in tow the wrong way, but leave them to the joyless corporate eateries of midtown!
I have eaten out a great deal in the past 20 years and have come across many great little gems but Max Soha is not one of them
From the reception at the door to the rude service and etible food I was truly disappointed again
I don't think a third time will happen
Go at your own risk but take it from me there are much better places in the area
The best surprise is when your not expecting one
I was tired of the same old, same old so I decided to go uptown, way uptown
It was a nice combination of good food, good service and a fun atmosphere
Their homemade pasta was al dente!
I just love this place
The food is delicious and inexpensive
I've been a frequent guest since I moved to the neighborhood
Their waiters are very personable and helpful, no complaints there
Overall, one of the most authentic Italian restaurants in the city
I've never been a big fan of Italian food because the fare has never captured my attention, although I eat it quite often because my friends and family love Italian
However, I LOVE Max Soha and just may be my favorite restaurant in NYC
The creamed spinach and gnocchi is terrific, as is the lasagna
I don't understand why people said the staff is rude
Maybe that is because they are high-maintenance or rude clientele
They were extremely nice to me and very kind, each time i've gone
The small room makes the restaurant cozy and gives it it's atmosphere
GREAT PLACE
I went to max soha last sunday, when they were almost about to close, and the food was amazing, the server was SUPER kind, I had such a great time!! try the black linguini with shrimps, and don't forget the Tiramisu, is the best in town!!!
Cantinetta is a real treasure in a see of mediocre Italian restaurants
I found the food to be just as good as its owner, Da Silvano, just much less expensive
The ambience is also more laid-back and relaxed
Both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing
Definitely try the taglierini with truffles - it was incredible
Also, the staff is very attentive and really personable
Overall, this is a great new restaurant that has been consistently good every time I have been
The Scene This tiny sliver of a restaurant, perched above a gallery-like Madison Avenue Japanese tea shop, specializes in kaiseki, a meal of tiny courses traditionally served with tea
The layout is spare, with deep-brown wood floors, straw-colored clay walls and big street-facing windows
A reliable team of servers circulates through the room pouring tea from iron kettles
The Food The kitchen cranks out artfully plated, salubrious fare, with an emphasis on vegetables and seafood
The lightest courses include quarter-sized rolls of tea-smoked duck and featherweight tastes of black soybeans, bamboo shoots and burdock
More elaborate courses include a lovely purplish-red sashimi of bonito over jasmine rice and roasted salt-encrusted striped bass with tea leaves
For dessert, ask a waiter to select an appropriate tea and unwind to sesame mouse, chocolate cake, or an eye-opening granite topped with shiso
Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce, which was wonderful
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size, Kai is your place
If you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share, Kai may not be the best option
The ambience is very calm and quiet
Staff members are fluent in Japanese and English, and very knowledgeable about their food (very rare to find at most Japanese restaurants in the US
)   Pricy indeed, but atmosphere and the setting pays off (stone dish is very elegant
)   Excellent for bringing a date to impress, or business dinner
Sake collection was excellent (Try Nanbu Bijin), but pricy
Not too crazy about their sake martini
Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware
Again, the waitress was awesome
She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice
Excellent

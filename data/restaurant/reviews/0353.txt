Yea, its true the wait is incredible
the atmosphere is crowded at times
the service is casual but the burgers are the best ive ever had
Get the chili cup as well, hands down delicious
The burgers are on the smaller side but tow with a cup of chili and a beer will put u up for the nite
I like the burgers, even though I think $8
00 is very pricey for a simple burger without fries
The fries are expensive at $3
50
The bartender sucks and has an attitude
Will just let you sit with an empty glass until you say something
Will never offer you a drink
I prefer White Horse Tavern and Corner Bistro for the burgers and pricing
I know this place has been around for a while and is very busy, but I believe in good service and hospitality when I am spending good money, which they do not offer
Why do people get so hyped up over nothing?
I don't get the hype either
The burgers are good, but there are many better burgers in town and the cottage fries are mediocre (IMHO cottage fries are always mediocre, which is why no one else serves them)
The decor is, well, aging bar decor
The service was friendly enough but detached, to put it politely
One positive is that they are open late
Which maybe also explains a lot of the rave reviews below - things tend to taste better at 1am when you've had way too much to drink
I have to admit, I keep coming back
I love the chicken sandwiches and the fries
But the guy who seats you is just aws rude as you've read
He's totally aweful
Mean, nasty, arrogant, yells at you to get out of the way, when there's nowhere to go! THe wait staff is usually unfriendly and seem annoyed
The prices are totally over the top
But it is always crowded, crazy waits
SO I guess they feel they can treat their customers like dirt, not take reservations, or credit cards, and charge an arm and a leg for a sandwich! Cause like me, LOTS of other people love the food and keep coming back!
Hands down the best burgers in the Big Apple's five boroughs
Though the wait may be long because they only have 16 tables it is worth it, and it seems to go by fast after a drink or two at the bar
If the bar is not too crowded
If you like a fat burger made on a griddle and are happy paying 9 dollars for it alone then this is your place
You have to order it with sauteed onions
The bun is too small so you inevitably make a mess because you're given lettuce and tomato as well
If you get bacon, you're in for a serious mess
The fries are of the cottage variety so theyre small, crisp, and fluff but are 4 dollars plus your 9 for burger plus 4 for beer equals 20 bucks equals too much
Keep in mind, this place is a bar that happens to sell burgers, its famous cause its been around since 1972
Eh
Rude
Obnoxious
There is no excuse for the horrible service at this place
They should be out of business
Stay away at all costs
The seater was so incredibly rude to our party, including snapping at a pregnant woman who politely asked about the wait, that we were too angry to eat there
No dinner is good enough to put up with that kind of arrogant rudeness
Ordered the highly vaunted burger
The burger's relatively small beef patty on wonder-bread bun
Fries were separate as well
Fries were tasteless and beer served in 1/3 pint glasses at pint prices
Service not good
Long time to get the waitress' attention as she busied herself with useless tasks and dealing with overly needy customers
When we finally received the check, we tried to pay with a credit card, but were abruptly told cash only
Don't recall seeing a sign stating this
People rave about the burgers
Only explaination for this is some people are desperate for a local place to call their own that they lower their standards and common sense
You could get a bigger, better tasting burger with fries included at any nearby pub or coffee shop as I did the following week
The only word that comes to mind when thinking of Melons is LEMON
A friend introduced me to J
G
Melon a couple of months ago and I've been back several times since
The burgers are excellent: tender, fresh, beefy and cooked to your liking
Sure they're served on a non-descript bun, but it's good to have a bun that doesn't try to upstage the beef or leave you wondering where's the beef?
The burger is so juicy and delicious that I have yet to stray from my usual order
While I love the burgers and they're reasonably priced, J
G
Melon does have some downsides
First, they are a cash only establishment
Second, they don't deliver
Third, there is a bit of a wait most nights, but that's more attributed to the great atmosphere and burgers
this is THE BEST burger in new york city - i've been to each and every spot in manhattan and this is the best tasting of all - HANDS DOWN
so - you have to wait
there is a reason for that - it is very popular
FOR A REASON!
Stay away people! It's a just a crappy burger joint! After waiting 45 MINUTES I asked the owner/maitre'd how much longer, and he YELLED at me saying he doesn't read minds and can't tell when people will leave their table! He was ASTOUNDINGLY RUDE to me and my party and we only stayed because we were starved and it was too late to go anywhere else
Don't believe the HYPE! It's just a burger, nothing special about it
I know the owner can't read minds, but I wonder if he can predict if I'll be back
I love Melons! It's the best burger ever! The Bloody Marys are also phenomenal, regardless what time of day! Can't beat the Coors light on tap!
I have been all over the city trying burgers and while others are good, the Melon simply cannot be beat
21, Island, Clarke's, Bistro, McHales, Burger Joint, etc
none can hold a candle to the Melon on pure burger goodness
Beyond the burger, the Melon offers a waiting list so that you can relax at the bar while the Bistro makes you wait in line
Also, the bloody bull (a bloody mary modified to include beef broth) is an excellent add on to the burger
If you are a burger fan, the Melon is not to be missed as it compensates nicely with the best burger for its spotty service and cramped environs
If I want a great burger I'll go to the Bistro
For the price of one of these you can feed two at the Bistro
Burger wasnt bad, but could have eaten 3 more
Service was terrible at best
This isn't just the best burger place in the city, it's the best restaraunt in Manhattan
If I were to have a private party and could rent out any place in the city, it would be JG
No pretention, no frills, no scene, no VonDutch hats
it's perfect
Order an extra spicy bloody mary, a burger (the best I have ever had and I consider myself a burger aficionado), some fries and while enjoying, plan your next visit
You CANNOT be the best burger in town if you serve your burger on store-bought-quality wonder bread hamburger buns
Especially for the price they charge
If the patty itself was so spectacular, fine
But a good, not great patty on a lousy bun gets a good rating, nothing more
You people should get out more who think this is the best one around
A thousand times better than Corner Bistro
I heard so much hype about Corner Bistro so I decided to try it

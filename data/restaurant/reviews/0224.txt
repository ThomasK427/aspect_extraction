i went for my friend's bday dinner but a couple next to us was having an argument so we could barely even hear each other
if i'm paying $100 a person for a meal then i really expect more than 1 foot space
it's really one of the most uncomfortable restaurants i've ever been to
there are so many other good japanese fusion restaurants in the area
this place is realyl not worht my time
WAY overrated
Even if you can afford to pay $12
00 for a California roll (with fake crab meat), it doesn't mean you ever should
unless it's encrusted in gold
Not worth the trip
Mediocre at best and highly overpriced
I've been to A LOT of Sushi places around the country, and this was definitely the best
Seating was prompt (without a reservation, no less!) and the staff could not have been more helpful
They recommended the 5 course tasting menu for 60$
Truly amazing
Everything from Octopus to Veal Chops to little tiny hard shelled crabs that you eat whole! (They're a little crunchy, but worth it!) Dessert was a chocolate lovers paradise
Their sushi menu is extensive and really fresh, as is their drink menu
Try the Banana concoction to cap off your meal
I can't wait to go back!
We went with a group and everyone loved it!! The service was prompt and professional
We had a sake tree in their lounge and finished with dinner in the restaurant
We were guided through the menu and had some great appetizers,(especially the kobe beef with spice scent) and sushi
It's funny that this morning I wrote a not so good review and then had such a great lunch! The sushi here is delicious, especially the lobster tempura roll
A must try! The service was great and the environment was upbeat yet relaxed
:)
Sushi Samba Park is truely one of the best Sushi Resturants that you could possibly find in NYC
Along with their welcoming hostess' and colorful atmosphere, Sushi Samba has a lively/friendly vibe to it
This is deffinately the place that you would go for a Fancy girls night out! The Sexy atmosphere is to die for
The food is the best cuisine that you could ever find
I love this resturant so much
If you are ever in the city, You should deffinately visit this resturant, because i promise you that you WILL have the time of you LIFE!
my brother got together 15 of my dearest friends and threw my a surprise party in there private dining room the Sugar Room it was one of the most amazing rooms i have ever seen!!! we did a tasting menue of 7 courses it was the best meal i have ever eaten at sushisamba, and i eat there atleast once a week
the waitress Taylor was ontop of everything and the managers Andrew Udi and Uriel were so good to us as usuall and that samba tree they got us filled with shots was NUTS!!!
First, making reservation meant nothing
We had to wait for 50 mins while seeing other people who came after us being seated first
The host was extremely rude when we asked when we'd be seated
The coat check was a disaster
they couldn't find people's coats! Finally, we had to SHARE our table with others
we left since they are too snobby for its quality
My girlfriend and I happen to go on a night where the corporate chef was visiting the location and was cooking his own tasting dishes
It was absolutely fantastic food and I don't even like this type of food normally
The Service was also excellent
The only somewhat negative is the ambiance as the tables are close to each other and it is not romantic but otherwise I highly recommend it
I've not been to the 7th Avenue Sushi Samba and can't wait to go in the summer! This was a good experience
Great speciality drinks (I had the Pisco, it was great!) The appitizer of soft-shell crab started our mouths watering, and the sushi was intersting and well done
I'll save my final decision until going to the 7th Ave Sushi Samba
i would go back for the tuna frois gras sushi, which is not on their sister branch's menu -- the stuff melts in your mouth
other than that though, the wait's long even with a reservation, it's loud and crowded, not to mention overpriced
but if you like that kind of thing -- including the bright colors -- it's a pretty nice place
it can get crowded here, but it is with good reason
their sushi is slightly above par, but the special sauces they put on it is what really gives it that wow!!!  i highly recommend their drinks and the service was great despite being full
Nice place
Most of the wait staff had a bad attitude starting with the hostess
I mean come on; it's far from the hottest spot in town
Thought may be the food would make my experience more pleasant, well
it appeared to be simply OK
Decor could definitely be refreshed
Tables for two people are ridiculously close
the food is great
completey different then say Nobu
and with that I highly recommand this place for the people who love sushi but want a twist in there normal sushi style
we have amazing dishes with tuna w/ mango type flavors
The fish is as fresh as it could be
and they have a great drink menu
the lemon Samuri is great
they also have a great mix have latin style music playing to a funky bass (some would say a Acid jazz with latin over tones)
Ppl should know what they should expect when going to Sushi Samba
It's more of a hip, trendy spot than an authentic sushi-serving Japanese place! Dishes are both Japanese and Latin-inspired
This was my 2nd visit actually, but 1st in taking advantage of the lunch prixe-fixe
Had the fire roasted shrimp, florida keys grouper and crema de pina for dessert
Shrimp was real good, grouper was ok, yet the crumb and the sauce was awesome
Dessert was simply blissful
Altho I never tried their special sushi dishes, Im not planning to, just becuz I have eaten real great sushi at other authentic sushi places
Yet I still love this place for its great diverse culture inspired unique dishes and great atmoshphere at night
I 3 Sushi Samba Park
I hadn't been to this place since it opened in the 90s, and it's still packed! Not too much so, but enough that there's a great scene
The food was great - sushi was good, but the cooked food amazed us
Get the miso sea bass and a killer cocktail; it's a great date spot and fun for girls' night out!
tried just about everything on the menu with a large group
ceviches were poor with overpowering sauces masking bad fish quality
sushi and sashimi were disgraceful
sashimi came out half-frozen, and their highest grade toro was full of tendons
why go there to deal with staffs' attitude and eat bad food?
I'm am appalled at how long I waited for my meal
The table next to us arrived 30 min after us, ordered the same meal and received it WAY before we did
Our dessert took just as long and upon complaint, we received nothing in return
I could not enjoy what would have been an otherwise good meal because we had to wait so long!
I went to Sushi Samba Park last week and had a great time
this place is still it
The food was excellent
the cocktails were great as usual
the restaurant was rocking
I always enjoy stopping in here
i went there for dinner on friday night, the waiter had a terrible attitude
when i try to order sake he asked for my id , i showed him my driver's license and he called it a fake!! the food was overpriced i would not go there again!
Our server took the time to give us brief intro to sake and shochu - he was knowledgeable and entertaining
Ceviches were fresh and unique and our server made excellent recommendations
A great place to catch up with friends in a upbeat, trendy atmosphere
My friends visiting from Tokyo made a special request to visit Sushi Samba - now I know why! Amazing sake, delicious sushi and an atmosphere that wipes out any memory of a bad day
I didnt realize that the restaurant served Brazilian foods and the fusion of South American and Japanese flavors is spot on

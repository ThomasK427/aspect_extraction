Excellence at its very best!
Brilliant food! Chef Annie O'Hare is a genius
Everything we ate was sublime
Great wine list too
Why don't we hear more about this woman and this restaurant??
INCREDIBLE, SO CHIP AND SO GOOD WE HAD A NACHOS FOR LESS THAN 4 BUCKS AND FROZEN MARGARITAS FOR 3 OUR MAIN DISH WAS THE BEST GREEN ENCHILADAS I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE IN THE CITY
OUR FRIENDS AND I WERE HAPPY TO FIND THIS LITTLE PLACE IN TOWN WE WILL BE BACK FOR MORE SINCE WE WERE HEARING COMENTS FROM OTHER TABLES ABOUT HOW GOOD WERE THE PLATES THEY HAD
The food is delicious and the quantaty offered is fair for the price
It has a festive atmosphere and is a great place to have a couple of drinks with your girlfriends
After trying TONS of attempts at tex-mex in the city, this place comes closest
First off, the margaritas are abso-friggin lethal
Yay
The food was excellent
Best enchiladas I've had in a really really long time
The staff was efficient and knew their stuff
It's in a crappy part of town, but it was either this, or fly to Austin
When this place first opened it was SCARY - but now - under new management the food, decor and service are much improved
Try the SUPER-CHEAP lunch specials
Try the Enchiladas Suizas
It's the single best Mexican food experience I've ever had
I'm hooked on that stuff! The drinks and food are inexpensive, why not give it a try?
The Scene Cafe Boulud is much less grand than its owner's flagship, Daniel, but it cedes little in quality (or price)
The medium-sized, simply furnished room is filled with a very Upper East Side buzz
Service is formal and exceedingly attentive, but not intimidating; ask questions and you'll get excellent advice
The Food Executive Chef Andrew Carmellini offers no less than four menus--seasonal, traditional, vegetarian and global--and diners are encouraged to mix and match between them
Most will gravitate toward the traditional and seasonal menus, the highlights of which include soft, crispy codfish matched with a fricasee of beans, pickled ramps and rough-textured mustard sauce, and a remarkably tender duck with spicy greens, wild rice and Vidalia onions
But the vegetarian option should not be overlooked: It offers exceptional clarity and freshness of ingredients
The global menu is probably the weakest--which means it's just very good, as opposed to transcendent
Fantastic, real pleasure, great menu, its not stuffy yet the food is a delight
You can't go wrong
Based on the reviews and recommendations, we went for dinner and had the tasting menu
One course after another of totally average food was served
We sent one course back to the kitchen for being inedible! The wine pairings went well, but the wine itself had the same average quality
Boloud was compared to Thomas Keller's Bouchon (his cafe version of the French Laundry)
We have been to both and very high hopes, only to have them dashed
The upside was that the staff was Fabulous!!! Courteous, funny, gracious, attentive, and when we sent back the foul fish, they could not have bent over backwards more to see that we were happy
We have a pretty positive attitude so we still had a wonderful time and I think the staff were overly helpful since we were not snotty about it, but for $500, it was totally not worth it
In terms of upscale dining, this is my favorite place in NYC
Although this restaurant is not top of most published lists for fine dining, it has the best combination of food, setting and price for what it offers
The food here is always excellent
The menu always changes
On one occasion I had the chicken, another occasion I had a frisee salad
Both were delicious and perfectly executed
The atmosphere is elegant but not stifling
Some people say it's noisy but I haven't experienced that myself
It is on the pricier end of things but it is definitely not exorbitant, you pay for what you get
Simply fabulous! What more can I say? Attentive, warm, sophisticated service
Some of the most delicious food I've ever eaten
Get over the older crowd and go!!!
I went to restaurant week and the menu was absolutely fabulous
I usually hate eating chicken when I'm dining out but this place totally changed my mind
The canadian chicken and the chocolate tart is to DIE FOR! I totally recommend it
This restaurant I definetely go back to just because the service was great and the food was superb,you should definitely make reservations because it gets busy
i loved it
Excellent food and good service
Although they describe the place as a casual to dressy one, most men were in jackets (and some even in ties), hence, I recommend that when dining in this fabulous restaurant, lean towards the dressy side
My overall experience in this place was great, and I will definitely be back
I had an entirely average experience at this often touted restaurant
If you can stomach eating dinner with a bevy of upper east side patriarchs and matrons then you should be ok
The decor and ambiance is lackluster which to me often means the food is the star, as it was (but no longer is) at the Tasting Room three or four years ago, however, the food was just alright in my opinion
The salmon tartar bordered on flavorless, the terrine de fois gras was exquisite but I owe that more to the goose's diet than the chefs skill
The rabbit tasting was quite good, however, the smoked duck merely adequate
I expected to be amazed considering Daniel's reputation, but unfortunately, it was as dimensionless as the clientele
Service was a bit on the spotty side too
We were offered coffee between the amuse guele and the appetizer course
Hmmm
Usually these are the places that you either love or hate - great food, over priced, rude service, nice space, etc
I was surprised at my reaction - I neither loved nor hated it
Maybe it is that UES is overun with French fare and it has worn thin
The service was bad, however
It was hot and we were sitting outside so I wanted a cool bottle of white wine
When I ordered it the waiter SNEERED! As if it was the wrong moment in my ordering process to ask for the wine
Food was typical very rich French fare that made you want to go to bed
This place is top shelf - every detail of service, every morsel of food, every drop of wine, was first rate
It is expensive, yes, but worth it - it is refined yet not stuffy in the least
(Not that I would recommend this, but there was even a couple wearing jeans at dinner
) You will not be disappointed
I've enjoyed all NYC's best restaurants (a number of times)
If you allow the chef to let loose here and bring whatever he chooses, along with the well-paired wines, you will be well-satisfied
The many pleasures of fine dining don't get any better than this


and without pretense or prissiness, too!  My thanks to all the staff at Cafe Boulud
From the moment we sat down, the evening flowed, as a barge down the Seine
Our server was informative and led us through the menu, catering to our tastes
All four of us loved every morsel--appetizers and main courses
The scallops were spectacular, mushroom soup divine
can't say enough
Worth every penny (and there were many)
Will go back when I am next in NY
I wish LA had a Cafe Boulud West!
We dined there for our anniversary and every thing was perfect
The food was great, the service was nice and we loved the coziness of the place
We also loved the bread that make in the house
I would go back just for that yummy bread
we will not forget this place
Until you try Cafe Boulud, you can only imagine how incredible the food can taste
Don't take anyone's word for it, just go and try for yourself
The service was so good we felt like royalty yet in no way was it intrusive
We took our 4 year old daughter who is well behaved

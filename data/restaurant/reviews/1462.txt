They opened this new Indian grill called YUVA
This is a super romantic, elegant beautiful restaurant with extremely gracious service and most importantly authentic Indian food with great quality best value
They have been consistently good
I am glad to have tried it in the first place
I am hooked on
I can blindly recommend this place to all
Go experience it yourself
trust me, you cant go wrong
I went here for my birthday and I loved it! From the warm greeting as you enter to the table
The staff was so friendly and attentive without being annoying or pushy
The best part is that you aren't crammed next to another noisy table like some other restaurants in NYC
The food had a lot of original flavors and presentation was fantastic
Yuva is a unique Indian restaurant, that has authentic Indian food falvours, yet a cool trendy ambiance
I went to Yuva with my entire family for father's day, I have to share this with you, The food, service or ambiance, this restaurant really rocks
From their tandoor, one must try tandoori shrimp, tandoori muchrooms, kakori kabaab, the slow cooked must try thier the biryanis, mushroom chicken, we had Okra Crunch, malai kabaab, the whole red snapper
it was so tasty and also beautifully presented, we loved every bite of it
We tried their sheermal for dessert which was so yummy, we were stuffed
Truely eyes are bigger than stomach when you come here
I have tried every Indian place in the city, but never had such amazing Indian food in last ten years, since i m here
The service is a class apart from the regular rut
I was told by the owner that they are merely four months old on that block, I couldnt believe it, because the food, the service, the ambiance just about everything was so perfect, it was hard to believe such finnesse
I rested my case, when I came to know that the owners are the same from Salaam Bombay in downtown Manhattan
We have been going to salaam bombay practically everyday for lunch since past nine years as I work in downtown
Although my dad is from the older generation, he was equally in love with yuva's food, charm and brilliance
Now we know, the perfect place for gooooood food, grrreat ambiance gracious service -----YUVA------ thats it for us for Indian :)
GIVE IT A SHOT, WE HAD DINNER THERE LIKED IT A LOT
I AM A BUKHARA FAN AND THEIR CHEF(CHEF RAM) IS FROM THE ORIGINAL BUKHARA (MAURYA SHERATON) NEW DELHI
ITS TOTALLY WORTH IT
Yuva
new name first was an italian place then bukhara then khyber and now Yuva
maybe this time the name will stay for more then 1 yr
I went here a while ago after some people were talking about it at work
I walked in and noticed is was a little busy but had a long waiting
The place had a new look which liked
but the chef was the same
we sat on the table right in front of the chef
The food to me was the same as last time
It was just O
K
not something to go crazy over
Service was good
I picked this place purely by City Seach and nothing else, and I must say I was pleasantly suprized
We were a party of ten, and were greatly accomodated by the restaurant
The location is a little tiny, so I wouldn't recommend going with any party larger then 10 (but that is just not fun dining anyway)
The prices were good as well, averaging about 35
50 a person (including drinks and tips)
If you are a fan of indian food, this is definately the place for you
One of the best parts about the meal was before even ordering we had two large trays of sauces to try, all of them quite excelent
I am definately recommending this to everyone I know, and going back soon
I entered Yuva restaurant skeptical at first since there are so many Indian restaurants on my block
I figured it's just another Indian Fusion
Well I was dead wrong! This is the most spectacular Indian restaurant
I can honestly say that I left REYUVANATED! Charm, class, decor, and above all the food! Simply divine
They have a phenomenal wine list and full bar
I had never seen such a wine list before at an Indian restaurant
So far everything recommended on the wine list went above my expectations and left me satisfied
You must also try one of their signature cocktails
Delicately prepared one by one! Awesome! *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* + a must fine dining experience to dazzle all 5 senses!
i'm a big foodie
i love all kinds of food, i'm particulary big on eastern culinary indian, thai and chinese
i dined at yuva on a recommendation
and let me tell u i'm hooked
i've been there five times in the last month
i cannot say enough about this place everything from service, ambiance and most importantly food is amazing
the menu is divided into three sections tandoorgrill, slow cooked and for the table
must try a dish from each section
rack of lamb and chicken mushroom are my favorites
must check this place out
SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FOOOOD ????? JUST AWESOME !!!!!!! ITS A STEAL FOR THE PRICE
I M THERE PRACTICALLY EVERY WORKING DAY
WE SIMPLY LOVE THIS PLACE
THE FOOD YUM SERVICE IS ROYAL
MY COLLEAGES LOVE IT TOO
DINNER AT YUVA IS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE!! THIS IS EASILY THE BEST INDIAN FOOD IN NEW YORK CITY
This restaurant is absolutely a must try
Chef Dhandu Ram is a master cook, and the food is excellent
Highly recommend the hariyali chicken and the fish steak
The ambiance is also really nice and a step above from the uniform Indian restaurants out there
Good service too
THIS IS NOT ONLY BEST INDIAN I'VE EVER HAD, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS I'VE EVER EATIN IN
EVERYTHING FROM SERVICE TO AMBIANCE WAS JUST RIGHT
THE FOOD WAS SO FLAVORFUL EVERY DISH WE HAD TASTED DIFFERENT (YOU DON'T FIND THAT IN TOO MANY RESTAURANTS)
RECOMMENDED DISHES RACK OF LAMB, SCALLOPS, CHAPLI KEBAB AND SUBZ PLATTER
OWNERS KEDAR HRITU SHAH WERE PRESENT AND MADE SURE WE HAD A GREAT TIME
We went to Yuva for my cousins birthday party, apparently he didnt have to think twice about throwing his bday bash there, as he had already been there  before
Trust me the entire experience was Amazing
cool new cocktails, amazing apps, we were seated on Chefs Table for dinner ;) All ten of us were extremely comfortable, where the Chef came personally and we had special dishes that were pre-decided by my cousin for his party
The food, the service, the ambiance, and personlized attention and care was just excellent
Other than the desserts that we ordered, they surprised us with a special house pie with a little candle on it, which was just too delicious was on the house
(I love their bathrooms too)
What a complete package, I am really impressed
I love this hotspot, and gotta party soon at Yuva again
Highly recommended
It is just another Indian restaurant trying to do something new but ran the race by putting it self in the reverse gear
The grills are very fresh but same old stuff like chicken tikka,Raan,lamb chops and a very very long list of breads
The apps are very interesting and the slow cooked are a must have
Over all this restaurant has a lot of work ahead of it
Average at best food
So many better choices on the same street
One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time

My boyfriend took me to dinner here last Saturday night
I'm not quite sure if it was the rain outside, the delightful and hearty food, or the amazingly gracious server, but even at the end of the meal, I couldn't bear to leave the restaurant! The atmosphere is perfect for a cozy dinner; romantic enough for two, but loud and vibrant enough for a large party (we were seated next to a five-top and saw two large groups come and go)
My boyfriend's french onion soup was one of the best I've ever tasted, and my dijon salmon was so filling I couldn't even finish it! Although we didn't have dessert, the real the evening was relaxing in the dim glow of the restaurant, finishing our glasses of wine, and enjoying the wonderful buzz of the diners
I would like to preface this by saying thank you to the staff at the York Grill for giving me a fantastic birthday dinner
The skirt steak and lamb was excellent, plus the warm romaine salad is a must try
Plan on taking food home,as we did, the portions are huge and at great prices
Family outing to celebrate some birthdays
It was very nice ambiance, the owner/manager were very attentive to our needs (especially with our stroller)
Service was par excellence
Nice menu selection
Spring rolls were better than expected, crab cakes calamari were ok
Entrees - the veal was very good but the lamb chops lobster ravioli were disappointing
SUM IT: For an occassion this would be a nice choice due to ambiance service, but the food is average fare for the price
Simply stated, this is my wife and my place
We eat here at least everyother Friday
More than just a neighborhood place; it should be a destination --- but we selfishly hope it stays under the radar
Inventive food
Affordable wines
Nice size drinks
But more importantly the nicest, most courteous wait staff in NYC
You feel like family from the first visit
Unlike many other restaurants in the city, yes you can have both; Great service and great food! The York Grill is a wonderful all around restaurant
Very cozy without being cramped
Romantic on a date and even great to take the folks
I keep going back because I crave the great skirt steak
The brunch on Sunday is one of the best I've had, and a good deal
This was absolutely the most amazing dining experience
My boyfriend and I wanted something romantic and that's what we got
perfect ambience!the staff was friendly and efficient and not at all pretentious
The crab cakes were the best I've had and the skirt steak, their specialty, was fantastic
I will keep going back
I can't say enough positive things about York Grill
Everything is superb from food to service to atmosphere to prices
I've gone back countless times and every time is as perfect as the next
I used to make it a point to try new places with so many NY restaurants, but I can't help going back time after time
My date said it was the best place I've been in Manhattan! We felt like VIPs from the moment we entered! The warm greeting from the manager, the pleasant coat check girl, the nice jazz music
Not once did we feel rushed
And, there was no stuffy atmosphere! We were promptly seated at the corner table! The menu is full of mouth-watering selections, making it difficult to decide
The portobella mushroom with goat cheese and tomato, and the filet carpaccio appetizers were spectacular! The roasted garlic and shitake mushroom stuffed filet
PERFECT! The mahi mahi
absolutely delicious
And our waiter, Carlos, was knowledgable, attentive, and unobtrusive
He helped make the evening even more enjoyable
I'll definitely return and bring out-of-town guests and clients
This is one of the undiscovered gems in the city
Luck for us it is so far over on York
The food is always good, the dining room is quick charming and the staff friendly
Just a great place for a great meal and not too expansive
This is by far one of the best restaurants we've been to
The service is perfect, food is perfect, and its not too expensive
The only downside is that its tucked all the way in the NorthEast corner of Manhattan (block away from Gracie Mansion)
But we live around the corner so its perfect
Even the sunday brunch is the best we've ever had
We highly recommend this quiet little restaurant to any and all in search of a great dining experience
They are out best pick in the city
Most friendly service, very relaxed, reasonably priced, and very fresh
Cant get any better than Isohama
They work hard and we love them (I'm a Japanese and love them very much!!) Try Katsu, Kara age, Age Dashi Tofu, and any sushi!
What a great find for me
Great selection of sushi (love the sweet shrimp and uni)
Very fresh
Non-sushi appertizers are very delicious
We ordered the fried chicken, and it's probably one of the best I'd ever had
Service is prompt
I like the decor
It's clean, it's very spacious and quiet
And the price is so very reasonable
It looks like a regular Japanese sushi place, but it's much better than that
Too bad for its location, as this place will obviously be more packed if it's in the 80s
In my humble opinion, Al Bacio is the best
All the pasta dishes are delicious and the service is superb
The portions and presence of each plate were well worth the price (it is a touch expensive for the area, the TUNA, after tax, cost us almost $20
00)
The service staff went out of thei way to see that my party had everything we needed and more
Our server turned out to be the one who MAKES the fresh pasta
Very impressive
Let me start this review by stating I am not usually one to complain about restaurants
I love to eat and I will eat almost anything that is put in front of me
However, I will never eat at Al Baccio for as long as I live in NYC
Through the years I have tried to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt three times and it has failed each time (three strikes)
primarily due to the lack of taste in the food
Recently, my girlfriend decided to try Al Baccio with a friend of hers and decided that she liked the rigatoni vodka
Therefore, per her request, I decided to give it another try and guess what
STRIKE FOUR
Don't eat here
By the way, this is the only review I have ever written about a NYC restaurant because the experience was really that bad
This was the first restaraunt that I went to upon moving to the UES
I am all about the Rigatoni w/ Pesto Chicken Pasta
HIGHLY recommended
Good service, very good food, decent prices
In Short This restaurant is a must for dog fans
Everywhere you look there are dog statuettes, canine clocks, puppy posters and photos of celebrities posing with their best friends
Real dogs, unfortunately, are not allowed on the premises
The menu offers basic luncheonette fare, with adjustments made for the Upper East Side clientele (yogurt instead of ice cream, granola in lieu of sprinkles)
Burgers served on focaccia are highly praised, as is the meatloaf
If you want a great place to eat, not spend a lot of money, and a relaxed restaurant, Barking Dog is for you
Their Cobb Salad is really good, their burgers are great and all of their breakfast entrees are always good
Eat outside if you can
If you have a dog bring them too, it's one of the few places that caters to dog owners
I love the decoration and atmosphere of this place

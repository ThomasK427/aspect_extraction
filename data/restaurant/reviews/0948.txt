Water glass was always full
Now, the food was impressive
We would recommend the red snapper with mussels/shrimp in marinara sauce
A pleasant surprise all around!!!
I have now dined at Cantinella numerous times, and I can assure anyone who enjoys good service and even better food then this is a great restaurant to visit
The fettucini with porcini mushrooms in a truffle oil(they serve it as a cream suace or just the truffle oil)is to die for!!! The last time I was there I was with a picky eater and they were extremely attentive to her needs and were able to suggest some non menu items
This is true dining experience!!!
My lamb special was grossly undercooked and grossly overpriced
Veggies bland and room temperature
The grilled octopus appetizer was quite yummy but almost too big
Service was amateurish at best, and not in keeping with the prices
Very disappointing overall
Though the space is very attractive, they seem less concerned with the dining experience
The Scene Just steps from a waterfront park overlooking Manhattan, the converted warehouse space is bright and spacious, with three offset levels of dining areas visible from the entrance and bar area
Because it's a family joint, servers, hosts and bartenders all exude folksy charm, and even when service is stretched a bit thin, things tend to work out fine
The Food The brunch menu is the biggest draw
Kids love the fluffy sourdough pancakes with fresh fruit and the raisin French toast; parents should order the lox scramble or the eggs Florentine
Comfort food--like dreamy macaroni and cheese with excellent, crispy buttermilk-fried chicken, or barbecue ribs, slow-cooked brisket and pulled pork--is what's for dinner
And though it's not easy to save room, a slice of the sour cherry, apple or strawberry-rhubarb pie is worth the effort
Have been there a number of times food is awlays great but can get very noisy
Stay away from the PLAY area
The brunch here is excellent
I especially enjoyed the sour cream pancakes
Prepare for a long wait for your table and toddlers on the loose everywhere, but the food is well worth it
the place has awsome brunch, We had a delicious egg benedict over spinach and eggs with smoked trout
The biscuits were delicious and the food was really good
It's slightly pricy but the place is right next to the waterfront park under the bridge
Its a good date place to bring on a nice afternoon or a good ambience for friends to gather
I went Bubby's Brooklyn on the recommendation of Citysearch unfortunately they were wrong
This place is not a great place for brunch
I went there on a Sunday and waited a 1-hour for a table
The service was slow and the food was below average
The homemade pie I wanted was sold out by noon
Its too bad the area does not have many other restaurants because we would have walked to another place
I have not gone to Bubbys Manhattan but I surmise theres no difference
To begin with, My boyfriend and I got to Bubby's at 830pm on a Friday night in August
We were greeted by an interesting, waiter who barely spoke and when he did he whispered
My boyfriend orders the ribs and our whispering waiter tells us there all out! We both looked at him expecting him to laugh and say he was kidding
too bad HE WASN'T! How does a BBQ joint run out of ribs at 830pm? Did I mention the restaurant was empty as can be? I'll skip over the rest by saying that all the wonderful pie reviews in the world couldn't have made me or my boyfriend want to stay a minute longer because judging from the rest of the meal
it would NOT likely have lived up to expectations
It sounds like another reviewer had an unfortunate experience with Bubby's pie, but don't write them off yet! The sour cherry pie is the perfect balance of sweet and tart year round, and the home-made vanilla ice cream is the perfect accompaniment! Strawberry rhubarb is also wonderful
I tried the blueberry the other day, and while good, it wasn't as good as the other two
The brunch is great at Bubbys -- the sour cream pancakes are light and fluffy and tasty
Omelets are great too, if not pricey
(Expect to pay $16 for a special)
I've recently started eating dinner at Bubbys, and I love it! Great comfort food
My friends and I trekked out to Brooklyn on Sunday to take part in the Bubby's pie social
They were out of pie 2 full hours before the event was supposed to end
Desperate, we held ourselves over with some Grimaldi's pizza *yum* and then waited a good half hour for some take out slices of Bubby's famous homemade pie
Were we disappointed! They were out of cherry, so we got a few slices of apple and one key lime
The apple pie was dreadful
It had so much cinnamon it could make you sneeze
One friend remarked, did they forget the sugar or something?
Another said, I'd rather get the apple pie from Burger King
We are good eaters, but no one finished their pie
Sour apples, soggy tasteless crust, not sweet at all, and 7 bucks for a slice
Don't waste your time
good food (had the sourdough pancakes w/eggs brunch)
But the view was spectacular (Brooklyn Bridge Manhattan Bridge the park)
Around the corner is Jacques Torres chocolate (good hot chololate)
great area!
Brunch is crowded madness with toddlers and waits, but with good reason: the food is excellent
But Bubby's has become a favorite of mine for dinner
It's spacious and comfortable -- yet it's the food that brings me back
The American fare hits the spot with a solid burger, a great pulled pork sandwich, and killer cole slaw
Everything else I've tried on the menu has been really good too
Just avoid early sunday night unless you have or love lots of kids
Any restaurant in a hip neighborhood that doesn't warn its patrons before they wait an hour for a table that they may be seated between the playroom section and the geriatric cancer recovery table on it's way back from Temple only to have your service compromised by the fact that the waiters spend more time dodging ill-mannered toddlers than bringing you your coffee, toast and melon
HOWEVER - the Bloody Mary's are fabulous - if you go, you'll need to drink at least 4
BOYS! they took our brunch away from us - don't let them get away with it
The Scene Born of a partnership between the owners of buzz-worthy London restaurant Providores and a local New York design firm, this restaurant has an unmistakable air of trendiness
The crowd doesn't disappoint: A well-heeled, fashionable clientele packs the polished-wood-and-glass-partitioned space, settling into one of two dining rooms, or the bar, which is located at the farthest corner from the entrance
The Food With influences stemming from New Zealand, Australia, Asia and elsewhere, it's nearly impossible to put a label on the food here
Standouts among appetizers include hypnotically aromatic laska, a Southeast Asian soup; a trio of smoky seared scallops atop a mix of chili sauce and creme fraiche; and seared rare kangaroo served with a bright green, sweet-hot pepper relish
Entrees--with the exception of the tender venison loin--are less successful, but vanilla ice cream mixed with honeycomb helps make up for it
I had been hearing about public for a while now from my friends but it never sounded something that was my kind of place well I was wrong! Went to the bar on Saturday night and had an outstanding meal
The place itself had a wonderful, warm fun ambience
The bar staff was very inviting and the pineapple and mango mojito was sensational
The variety of wines by the glass was really interesting and unique thanks for a great night public (and date)! If you go get the scallops and the venison
Public is truly a gem consideing its off-beat menu with unexpected surpises in every plate
I started with the kangeroo appetizer which was so delicately prepared it melted in my mouth
For the entree I tried the sea tout (very similar to salmon) which was also beautifully presented
The bill for 2 people with a glass of wine each, came to $122
That's a bargain in NYC!
I am loving Public right now
I have been a few times (once for brunch, three times for dinner) and every time it blows me away
Last night I brought 2 friends who had never been and they agreed with me: the room is beautiful, sort of industrial but still cozy with fantastic lighting
The waitstaff is always so nice and very knowledgeable
And the food is delicious
We shared the oysters, fois gras and scallops to start and they were all so good we were fighting over the last bites
For a main course we had the duck, venison and a vegetarian dish with pumpkin and we loved it
We were too full for dessert but we wanted a little something sweet, so the waitress recommended that we get the plate of chocolates to share, which was a perfect choice
six little truffles to finish off the meal (I liked the salted peanut chocolate the best)
I read some negative reviews on Citysearch and I have to say I've never had less than a great experience
I will keep going back and bringing friends!
We had a birthday dinner last night at Public
Had been once before and decided it would be good to go back for dinner
The waitress started off very knowledgeable and attentive
Once we received our appetizers we never saw her again
We had ordered a bottle of wine and would have had another if there was someone around to order it from

He's friendly, fun, and makes the best daggone sushi anywhere
I cannot recommend this place more highly
Get a reservation
Enjoy
The people that didn't like it


I dunno what they did wrong
I went there with a friend of mine, and we both had a terrible experience
The sushi was awful; it looked (and tasted, of course) as if a trainee made on his first day of training
There are much better Sushi restaurants in Manhattan for that price!
Perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda
The staff is courteous and friendly
More important, the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt)
Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda
there's a ton of different types/cuts of fish here, helpfully organized by group (salmon/trout, whitefish, tuna, yellowtail, oysters/clams/shrimp, eel, uni/roe, etc
)
the fish is amazingly fresh, having been flown in that same day from all over the world
yasuda (request to be seated in front of him!) asks you what you like and recommends sushi that matches your tastes
hes a very entertaining gregarious man, who, despite having fingers like sausages, manages to create perfect bite-sized pieces of sushi with the perfect combination of fish/rice/soysauce/wasabi
the best way is to sample at least two fish from the same category (eg
uni from maine vs california, sea vs freshwater eel) to get a good taste comparison
if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side)
We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant! Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10:15
After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were! I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it, but they were not! I am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner, and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place! Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar (chef Yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte
My goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing
We've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky? In any event, even though its a bit on the pricey side, we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back
The staff especially the receptionist is very rude
The sushi was ok
It's not like others say it's the best in NYC
Make sure you order fixed price dishes
Don't try Omakase
It's outrageous! Both of us had about 30 pieces and were charged $380
I was absolutely appalled with the service demonstrated by Sushi Yasuda
Our party of 6 had one simple request over the phone to add one more person to increase our reservation to 7 people at 1:30pm
This was a last minute request, so we agreeded to make another reservation at another table
When we arrived, we were shocked to find out they wouldn't seat our 2 reservations for next to each other
We mentioned that there were empty seats in the restaurant as it was almost 1:45pm and asked why they wouldn't allow the 2 reservations to sit next to each other
Despite trying to talk to them in a civilized manner, the head waiter began yelling at us and told us to step outside as to not concern the other guests
The head waiter simply told us off and said that they wouldn't do it and wouldn't explain why
I was visiting New York during Christmas and I wanted to eat at the restaurant
I knew Yasuda when he was still at Hatsuhana
I made a reservation specifying that I want to eat at the sushi bar and served by Yasuda
I had to take a late reservation
When I arrived, all excited, and was told that the two places at the bar were not for me
I said there must have been a mistake
The maitre d' told that they never make mistakes
Well, even if it is rated 10/10, I shall never go there again!
I'd been to Yasuda multiple times, for both business and dates
I've always had a great experience as it is amongst the best sushi anywhere, including Tokyo
So when I got a check for $500 (including tip) I was thinking jeez did we pig out on the toro - no, we did have some good stuff including a couple of toro, house saki for two and we ate a generous amount in the 75 mins we were there, but the place has perhaps gotten very expensive recently (at least $150 more than expected)
I would have asked for an breakdown of the check to see where I went overboard, but didn't want to ruin the otherwise good vibe
I'm not complaining as such as it's a great place and you otherwise can control what you spend
Just be aware that it can be silly expensive if you're not careful
Yasuda is, in my opinion as a sushi snob, the best sushi restaurant in NYC for a sublime old-school sushi experience (no fusion or interpretive dishes here)
If you are alone or with one other person, I strongly recommend you sit at the sushi bar in front of Yasuda himself and order the omikase, were the selection of fish is left up to the chef (you should reserve and ask to be seated in front of him)
It will take a bite out of your wallet, but it is entirely worth it just to taste the freshest fish you will ever find anywhere! Be forewarned though, that you may end up comparing your sushi at other places to this one and being disappointed with everything else after this place
It's awful that they did this to me since I can't afford to come here as frequently as I would like!
Just ate here a few days ago and was served by Yasuda himself on the far right of the sushi bar
He would barely acknowledge us, served us very slowly and gave us relatively few portions
The sushi bar was not crowded at all, everyone else seated near us received excellent treatment
The freshness of the fish was hit or miss
The salmon and tuna were nothing special whereas the unagi (eel) , white salmon, and oyster were pretty nice
The tuna scallion rolls were actually disgusting
The pricing for omakase was obscene considering the amount of pieces you get at other places
Not recommended
The food was AMAZING
I love sushi and I've been to many Japanese restaurants
This was by far the best sushi I've ever had
It practially melts in your mouth
The service was also outstanding
It was a blissful experience
VERY expensive but worth the money for special occassions
I have been to most of the reenowned sushi restauarants in Manhattan and they do not compare to my experience at Sushi Yasuda
The pieces literally melt in your mouth
The toro roll was also amazing
Its difficult to stop ordering more pieces because each of them is like a slice of heaven
Its well worth the $$ and when you go, request to sit at the sushi bar
Possibly the best in the entire USA
Fresh selections are circled in red on the sushi/sashimi menu
A typical evening will feature several different types of hamachi, toro, mackeral as well as other fishes
Many of Yasuda's cuts are flown in from the Tsujiki fish market in Tokyo
All five sushi chefs are extremely good so it doesn't matter where you sit at the sushi bar
Yasuda also features a good selection of traditional Japanese cooked dishes as well for those not inclined to eating their raw fare
A visit to Yasuda is mandatory for any sushi fanatic when visiting NYC
My husband and I love sushi and have been to many places in the city
This is one of the best
The sushi is absolutely delicious
The toro melted in my mouth
Their service is always attentive
The price is steep, but worth every penny
this is the BEST sushi place in NYC! it is very expensive but there is a great deal on sushi and sashimi on the prix-fixe portion of the menu
the ambiance is lovely and the sushi is to die for! don't miss it!
sushi I have ever had
And my brother, who has spent significant time in Japan concurs
Even a layman can tell that the fish is incredibly fresh, and it makes a marked difference in the taste
I've never tried the cooked dishes when I've been, but why would you when there are more innovative restaurants specializing in cooked meals, such as Nobu

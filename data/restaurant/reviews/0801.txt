you guys have great brick wall exposure and an attractive setting
Get rid of the service bar and make a nice little bar to sit and eat
if you had this - you would have a winner on your hands
go look at pesche pasta up the street - you will get the idea
One of the few restaurants I've been to that serves their bread soft and warm
So good
The portions are huge
If you order any salad, make sure two of you are going to eat it - it's too much for one person! The arugula salad with sun-dried tomatoes is particularly good
We have been impressed by all the the dishes we've had
We go every few weeks
The wait staff is particularly friendly
We were ordering from here 3x a week for the past 3 months and lately we have been extremely disappointed
We spent $44 for 2 entrees and one very small cannoli; the portions were extremely small for Nicks and the dessert was not very impressive at all! We have never dined in the restaurant so perhaps the portions are larger
I would highly recommend the pizza; it is the best pizza in NYC, stay away from the pasta dishes
The sauce is mediocre at best and once again they never give enough sauce for the amount of pasta
We think they should stick to what they do best, the pizza
The first time you come in, they make you feel like part of the family
And you gotta love the open flame ovens!
It's not quite Patsy's, Lombardi's, or Grimaldi's but it is pretty good
If you are way too attached to the pecorino romano that the other 3 use then this isn't for you
Extra Cheese is a strong suggestion!!! Give it a shot
you won;t be disappointed!
Everything listed on the menu is intended to be shared by 2 (or even 3) so just ask for the 1/2 portion if you are planning to go solo (and the price reflected on the menu will be slashed in half for the 1/2 portion)
But even the 1/2 portions are extremely generous
The penne a la vodka was fabulous and so was the chocolate mousse cake for dessert
Great spot for good Italian food on the cheap!
I just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu
The food is tasty and light and the choice of teas I had with lunch (green with main dish and plum with desert were delightful
My daughter and I left feeling satisfied (not stuffed) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch
Not to be overlooked, the service is excellent
I'm not into Korean foold per se, nor am I a vegetarian, but the food here is so flavorful and fresh that you forget it's so healthy, too
Love the green tea pancakes, the dumplings, and am addicted to the stone bowl rice
Definitely one of my favorite neighborhood places
From the peaceful environment to the attentive yet non-intrusive service to the delicious food, Franchia is a winner on all counts
The vegetarian food is delicious, nutritious and healthy and even a non-vegetarian such as myself did not leave feeling hungry or wanting more
The first time I ordered Franchia, my girlfriend and I ordered a lunchtime delivery and found it so good that we ordered another delivery for dinner that same evening, and we enjoyed every single dish we ordered
I should mention that even the deliveries are tastefully presented
The teas and smoothies are fantastic and I now find myself having trouble walking by without stopping in for one when I walk by
I could not recommend this restaurant more
Was looking for a nice escape for lunch in the Murray Hill area and was very pleasantly surprised by Franchia
The atmosphere is relaxing in a very zen-like way
The decor transforms you from the hustle and bustle of the work day into a more serene and calm environ
The menu is reasonably priced and the food is good (it's all vegetarian)
I'll definitely be back there in the near future
I'm not a vegetarian but I love this place! Food is good, with lots of variety, not just a lot of extreme vegan stuff (try the corn cilantro pancakes), and the emphasis is on tea and the rituals of serenity
Highly recommended if you want to escape the city or your life for a short while
(They just opened around May 1st
)
Best food in town
Sooooooooooooo Good
I go there almost twice a week
Highly recommended
They must use the old hockey pucks as burgers- it is close to the game but that is the only offering- might be fine for a beer but if you have time- grab a meal elsewhere
In Short This Mexican joint's three red-roomed locations keep their kitchens cooking from lunch until the witching hours, churning out a homemade menu for Eastsiders on the go and tipsy revelers looking to nosh late-night
Staples are available every which way--tacos hard and soft, wrapped in tortillas stuffed with guacamole, cheese or black beans; burritos of beef, breaded catfish, pork pipian and chipotle chicken; plus a choice of four sauces from mild to just plain "stupid
"
Consistant and always tasty, cant realy ask for more from a fast food mexican joint
I've eaten at San Loco on 2nd for years, but since moving downtown, I couldnt get it (or anything else) delivered to me, but with this new one on Stanton, I can get a chipotle guaco loco delvered to my apt
on E Broadway at 3:00 AM! Great place to sit and have a shaken margarita too
I wouldn't recommend it at all
Union Sq could use some good lunch places and this is not one of them
Over priced weak sandwiches and overpriced average salads
You can do a lot better at a normal deli/bodega
the pumpkin corn chowder is one of my favorite things in the city
everything else i've had there - chicken burrito, cajun veggie burger, grilled cheese, wraps, etc
- is also amazing, though i find it hard to pass up the soup
a little pricey but worth it, and all the sandwiches are pretty big
Don't miss this place! It's not your average deli
The soups are excellent, and they'll let you sample them at the counter
Sandwiches are also very good, try the grilled cheese and the chicken prosciutto
This place has only been around for about a year but it is already one of the top places for falafel in the city
Haven't tried every thing on the menu but what I have tried has been very good
Especially the falafel, hummus, kafta and shwarma
The owner is a delightfully friendly guy and will sometimes hand out free falafels to people waiting in line for an order
This is a really great place for quick, cheap bite to eat
Great food and the guys behind the counter are really nice
Great Falafel and Hummas
The chicken soup is good too
Hihghly recommended if you are in the neighborhood
Murrays is now in my neighborhood restaurant rotation
One of my friends recommended i try murrays and i'm glad i did
The food is soo cheap! there's a huge menu and plenty to choose from
I tried the falafel (their specialty) and some schwarma - both were great
The food is really fresh too and so i felt healthy when i finished my meal, not heavy like at other restaurants
the service is also very friendly - try it
Something sweet is a wonderful little place to have nice little dessert
Chocolate covered bananas, truffles, cookies are unbelievably delicious
Mousses are light and taste heavenly
Yummy!!! Old Polish lady, whose husband, I suppose, is the owner, provides you with an excellent service
Other stuff is not as trained and nice as she is, just average, but good enough, too
I would recommend this place to anyone to have a sweet sensation on your tongue
I can never pass by this bakery without stepping inside
Their truffle buttons are to die for
I get really upset when they run out
but then I get to try the other stuff which have all been delicious
A great place to stop by to satisfy that sweet tooth
I take my friends who are not Filipino here
The food is good, not expensive with a laid back atmosphere
There aren't alot of Filipino restaurants here in NYC and when I heard that they were going to set up a Krystals in the city, I got excited
They have the original one in Woodside, Queens but I just have no time to travel all the way there

It is the perfect around the corner spot for a simple coffee and breakfast
It feels indulgent but it is so afforadable
I am addicted to the breakfast salad
Who would have thought salads were breakfast food? I don't know how they do it but simpe salads and dressings are so tasty and simple that you never get sick of them or feel something is too much
Chicory feels like it would be your favorite spot in Vermont or Maine or a quiet mountain town - but it is right here - in Brooklyn!
This place is so adorable and the food is ALWAYS great tasting
For breakfast I love the egg sandwhiches on 7-grain bread with rich cheddar cheese, the fluffy blueberry pancakes, the breakfast burrito and the exceptionally flavorful scones
for lunch the meatloaf melt and soups are amazing and for dinner chicken-under-a-brick, rissoto con funghi cakes and fries-with-truffle-mayo are truly amazing
not to mention all the sides and desserts! get there fast meet Gavin, the chef-turned-owner, and become a convert like me!
ok, so there are alot of hotdog places in the Lower East Side nowadays but how many can offer a good dog with a great variety of toppings? I had 3 dogs, avacado salsa, cilantro w/ garlic aioli and a stoned(chili cheese fritos) with a soda total cost? $7
50! They use Empire National Kosher Dogs and they do their Veggie stuff on a whole seperate grill! My wife is a pescatarian so the veggie dogs was a winner and the fact that they can respect a veg experience enough to put in a seperate grill makes her happy
Worth the trip just to check out the steel plated space with a beautiful center counter with no legs
oh, not to mention the dogs!
This place is TOO COOL! the design is awesome but in the end it's about the hotdogs
First they use Kosher dogs at a good price (3
50 for 2 dogs and a soda) they charge 1 dollar extra for toppings on both dogs
I had the Cilantro Salsa on one and the Avacado on the other
they were pretty good, though I think the dogs could be fried crispier(?)
They also have a veggie patty and veggie dog (not for me) but at least they were grilled on a seperate grill
Worth the trip for a inexpensive meal
Planned a bday dinner for my friend here after reading reviews and receiving a recommendation
First off, the decor of this restaurant is lush and gorgeous and you truly feel like you are at a top notch ski lodge
Secondly, the service was great
upon realizing it was my friend's birthday, the waiter brought us a round of complimentary shots and put a candle in my friend's dessert:)  Third, the DJ played a great eclectic mix of tunes
Finally, the food was also great! My 2 friends and I each ordered 2 small plates and we all split a side and that was PERFECT
we left full but not sickeningly stuffed
highly recommend the polenta fries and the lamb chops!  Will DEFINITELY be back!
after a boring week, went with girlfriends to this chelsea restaurant with a buzz so loud we felt we just had to see what it was about
Contrary to most hot spots, it has not become too BT which is great, drinks good, bartenders are nice, a few are good too look at (both male n female), food is great fo sharing, also since its late night, the place really picks up on thursday nights
we stayed until the wee hours, having a blast, the dj was phenom
Great waitress service
the busboy could have slowed down a bit
Sometimes it felt like a drive by when he serviced our table
The restaurant is really a nice space and the food is delicious
I was just hoping for a little more excitement
We went on a Thursday night around 9:00pm and the place was quiet
I guess it is more late, late night
I went with my girlfriend to celebrate my birthday on April 25
We arrived at Aspen because of their reputation on Citysearch, and we both concur the reputation is well deserved
Right from the moment we walked in (late for our reservation, I might add)
We were welcomed to our seat quickly and our waiter rapidly retrieved our drink orders
You really cannot order a bad drink at this bar
Once the food arrived, we swore we were in heaven
The portions are unusually small, but they don't compromise on quality
The Tuna Tartar, Bison Sliders, Lamb Chops, and their Lobster/lamb/kobe beef burritos were all phenominal
In the end, we left overwhelmindly satisfied, and didn't feel bad leaving a 30% tip
This place is far out of the ordinary
RUN to Aspen!
Aspen is a really cute place, the front half of the place is a bar, so you can sit, mingle and have drinks
Towards the back is the dining area
btwn the 5 of us we had 9 dishes which was barely enough
The tapas plates are really small and I was still hungry by the time we finished off the last plate but after the food settled in my stomach i was full
All the dishes we had were pretty good: the steak poivre, the bison burger, the striped bass, asaparagus, mashed potato sampler, chicken lollipop, and the duck quesadilla
if i had to pick the top 2, i'd go with the quesadilla and bison burger
this place makes u feel like u eat a lot, but u really dont
If u have a big appetite u might want to go somewhere else, or just order a lot more
Aspen has it all - great ambience, fabulous dj, eclectic wine list, beautiful barnwood bar, and great dining room with awesome central fireplace
I had a birthday for 21 people there and everything went like clockwork
Food came speedily (I had preordered the six courses and wine) and was individually plated beautifully - the presentation couldn't be better
The manager, Carl, is really going to go places in the restaurant industry should he so choose
He met me for wine tasting/sampling of food the week before and made sure that the service was on their toes
Kevin, who helped via email to plan the party was so buttoned-up and quick to respond
The waitstaff was very attentive, professional and the food was not just pretty but delicious
We drank there until 2am, no bottles
Literally Aspen made my birthday
I'm going back again as soon as possible
Had my birthday here on a Saturday night
I was looking for a rest/lounge and Aspen was perfect for that
The bar was crowded and the DJ was good
The restaurant area is separated from the bar which is nice if you want to be able to eat and enjoy your meal
The food was great and prices were reasonable
If you are with a group and looking for a trendy place for a good dinner and then want to stay and have drinks, this is a great place for that
Around 12 bottle service begins at the tables, but we sat and drank until 2am without getting a bottle
Overall, there was good service, food, and decor
I have been to Aspen several times, and each experience has been fantastic! First, the atmosphere is amazing and unique, a real breath of fresh air in the New York dining scene
They managed to create a resturant that is romantic and cozy enough to bring your girlfriend while at the same time being a great place to let loose and meet people during late-night
The food is great, with a wide selection of small plates; I highly recommend the trout tacos, bison burgers, and tuna tartar
The staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable, and complement the extremely good looking crowd that populates this swanky spot, (2 weeks ago I saw a celeb there!!)
If you are interested in sticking around the bar/lounge area after your meal, some of great dj's spinning an ecclectic mix of beats that is sure to keep you grooving until the break of dawn
We had the best night dining at Aspen
Friendly service, great atmosphere, tastefull decor and brilliant music (not to mention a good looking crowd)
Small plates looked great and tasted even better
Personal favorites were the Nyota cocktail and Trout Tacos
(and our sweet and sassy server!) The ambience lended a feeling of a well deserved night out on the town without the door policies and hassle
I went to Aspen on a Wednesday night, the place was empty and the hostess tried to seat our party of 3 at the family style seating saying that the they like to keep the tables for larger parties
The server suggest 3-4 small plates per person but we each ordered an appetizer and 5 small plates total (at an average of $15 each)
Unless you are really hungry, 2 per person is more than enough
We had the chicken lollipops steak au poivre
halibut (not recommended) and 2 orders of the bison sliders (they come 2 per order, they were a bit rare but very tasty) and the flan for dessert (average)
They had a nice selection of wines by the glass but were overpriced at $9-$10 per glass
I would go back to the lounge to have drinks although the music is too loud to have a conversation
Me and some friends read and article in IN TOUCH weekly that said THE COOLEST HOTSPOT IN NEW YORK
We made a reservation
We got there and had a wonderful purple margartia made from acai or something like that and then got seated
our reservation was for 10 so the dj was going on and the food music and everything was great
we stayed and partied till 2 am - what a great time
i even met a guy!!!
The drinks are $12 and weak
They made us wait for a table even though there were plenty of tables available
The place is all crappy wood and looks like the owner wanted a kitchy place to make a quick buck and be out in a year

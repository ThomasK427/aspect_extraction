We bring family and friends here and they always enjoy it
Don't leave without having the tiramisu, in fact, make sure you save room for it
It is the best I've ever had
Our favorite dishes are the lobster ravioli, carbonara, grilled calamari, and the mixed antipasta
There is one dish that you can order that isn't on the menu
Ned's chicken - a chicken breast stuffed with risotto some cheese in some type of white wine sauce
They do accomodate large groups
Food was adequate, if uninspiring
I never had gristly filet mignon before, and the flan was quite blah
Wine selection wasn't much to speak of, and the one we got wasn't worth celebrating (although it was one of their top selections)
Serivce wasn't friendly, neither was it rude, though
Server never informed us of specials, we only found out after a second group entered the restaurant and another server rattled them off for them
Clean restaurant
Not terribly expensive
Wouldn't go back, though
Belvedere is a hidden gem in an off-beat area
The decor is charming -- exposed brick, ornate ceiling, and even a patio for those hot summer nights
Dino and Ned are excellent hosts
Try their grilled calamari, it's the best
They also have wonderful steaks and pastas, but leave room for some of the best tira misu in the city
The only drawback is that they can't serve hard alchohol, however, they have a good selection of beer and wine
A great neighborhood restaurant with reasonable prices
This is one of our favorite Murray Hill restaurants --top-notch food, pleasant service, soothing atmosphere
It's a mystery why it's frequently half empty, but that's NY! Many places with lesser food and higher prices are packed
Just be careful about ordering the daily specials -- they can cost much more than the menu items
When I moved from London to NYC 5 years ago, I was somewhat concerned that I would have to forfeit going out for a curry
My fears were assuaged when I found Joy of India - the food is consistently excellent, they always remember me, the service prompt, and while it may not be the fanciest of restaurants the menu more than makes up for the lack of decor
I decided to go here based on one of the other City Search recommendations
I was extremely pleased
The prices were slightly cheaper than most Indian restaurants, the atmosphere is pleasant, and there were lots of Indian families dining there (which I took to be a good sign)
We tried meat and vegetarian thali platters to get a good idea of what their specialties were
The naan was hot and fluffy, the food all tasted fresh and non-greasy, and we ate like kings
Even though I live far from this part of town, I will definitely go back
Yes, prices are cheap, but so is the food
You get what you paid for
Ambience is weird: no specific decor, pop music, TV with sports on, WOBBLY tables, bad chairs
Service was the better part
But the food
um
don't recommend unless you're FAMISHED and on the verge of passing out
Have had better frozen pasta dinners than their 'fresh' pasta dishes
I had the $9
95 early bird special, and I think I've had better cafeteria food! Chicken parmigiana was horrible, so was pork chop and the gnocci
Wouldn't go back if you paid me!
for an inexpensive meal
I love this place and continue to go back
Everything is very high quality, with a real low price
If you want to have a pasta meal without draining the bank, I'd suggest visiting Sotto Cingue
I had a pasta which was (surprisingly) good with a $5 glass of red wine
This is a good spot for a weeknight meal
The pastas were amazing and affordable
The generous portion of gnocchi melted in my mouth
Can't beat the prices with some pastas under $5! The interior of the restaurant had nice warm tones
It was difficult to track down our waiter, but overall, it was a pleasant experience
Although sotto cinque is a value, don't sit by the door in the winter
It makes any meal value seem like you're being robbed! It was so cold that my feet were literally numb
The service also left more to be desired
I had a side dish of pasta and that was definitely the tastiest of the entrees we ordered
Overall, I think if we sat in the main dining area we would have been more comfortable, and our server may have also remembered us a bit more than he did
If that were the case, I don't think we would have been quite so critical of the food
Great Italian food to good prizes
The staff are so nice, and very concerned about giving you a great experience
Even though, there was a mistake made, it didn't matter, beacuse the way the waiter solved was perfect! Loved it !! Ciao!
Nice prices, good food, good location
What mroe can you ask for?
the food is cheap, but it isn't particularly great either
i echo the person that said you get what you pay for
unless you're really strapped for cash, this place isn't worth it
up and down 2 blocks either way on third are a ton of inexpensive restaurants with better food
also, i had an awful waiter last time that i was there
he made the experience especially unpleasant, although i noticed that other waitstaff were much more amiable
net sum, i think that it is hit or miss
It's very HARD to find decent food with great service and at a fair price in this neighborhood
Sotto Cinque is one of the very few
AND they have options for vegetarians which is even rarer in this area
Every time I've been here the service has been great and the food good to excellent
The only negative is that the acoustics make for a very LOUD atmosphere when it's full here
The food, while nothing extraordinary, is good enough
The service, however, can get amnesic at times (although I'm sure there are good servers there)
Cute decor, but rather small so the dining room can get very smoky if the bar is crowded
Combine the two with cheap prices, and its a good place to go for a quick pasta
I've been third times lately, and have always enjoyed the food
The value is incredible for what you get, I always have trouble getting up from the table
The service can be a little suspect, but still fast - just go here for the taste value!
I use this popluar take out restaurant at least twice a week
They deliver and I've used their food for quick executive type lunches in my office
[ @ 6
50 each ]
I Always receive compliments on thier food
if you're looking for an all you can drink beer special in NYC, then this is the place to go
11
95 gets you 2 hours of all you can drink draft beer and a hefty chinese dinner
great place to pregame before going out
They have an extensive menu
I've had 3 items: Vietnamese Sesame Chicken Rolls Spicy Shrimp Wonton Dumplings Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow)  They are each perfection! I'm afraid to try anything else here, and shouldn't be!!  Service with a smile, and the finest Har Gow in New York City
Who'd have thought it possible on East 28th Street?  Enjoy!!
I've never actually been inside the place, but have ordered delivery at least once a week for the past couple of months
The dinner specials come with a nice, if simple, salad with tasty dressing, soup, choice of brown or white rice, and your choice of a generous selection of entrees, all for less than $8
For me it usually ends up being three meals worth! The hot and sour soup is not great, but the won ton soup is quite lovely, and both the gong pao chicken and broccoli beef are tasty
The gong pao chicken varies in spiciness though

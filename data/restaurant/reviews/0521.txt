Very nice to children
Nice atmosphere, good food, the owners are very accomodating and only want to make this eating experience the best
Service is solid as well
You simply must try Portofino
Dining in the quaint village setting near a crackling fireplaces, it's easy to see why this restaurant has become a favorite
It offers a wide selection of delicious food; warm, friendly service; and reasonable prices
You won't be disappointed!
From the friendly bartender to the professional waiters and gracious owners, Portofino shines! Varied menu offers great choices to suit any appetite
Every night at Portofino is a perfect night!
Great variety on the menu, welcoming staff and excellent food
Not the cheapest, but I always feel at home and always enjoy the meal
This place is a little more expensive than the neighboring Italian restaurants, but IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH IT
The food is decent (not the BEST I've ever had
but certainly good enough to eat over and over again), but the decor is FABulous
It's so beautiful inside
You really feel like you are eating outdoors in a quaint village even though you are eating inside
They have a very nice prix fixe brunch menu for $15 that includes a cocktail, coffee, an appetizer, and a main dish
Another great thing: they have an extensive menu
I hate going to restaurants that only have a few things on their menu
This place has got lots
Definitely CHECK IT OUT
Really beautiful interior and decent enough food make it one of my favorite upper east side spots
Okay service but they really try hard (english apparently wasn't his first language but that's okay)
Sit by the fireplace when it's cold out
A big, splashy, pretty place with the feel of an Italian open-air cafe
Food's pretty basic but, pretty good, too! Not a gourmet experience, by any stretch, but the basic dishes (veal, pasta, seafood) are usually good quality and tasty
Service is generally efficient and prices are in keeping with other Upper East Side places
Desserts (especially the Tartuffo and Tira Mi Su) are outstanding!
Not only is this place one of the most quaint, cute, romantic places to bring a date, but it also has a great menu, and wonderful desserts
If you have never been
you must go
The sidewalk cafe decor with sky ceiling and street lights in the middle of the dining room, make you feel like you are in Italy
The waitstaff is very friendly, and the owner is a gem
Visit this little piece of Italy in New York
you will be glad you did
I thought that was one of, if not the best, cookie i've ever eaten
(Chocolate Walnut Chip) Ask if they have any warm ones
The space could be a little more user friendly
The best cookies in the world
thick, soft, morselly
Well worth $3
50
They also do a great briche and a brilliant baked jelly doughnut
Vey delicious cookies
BEST COOKIES EVER!  They don't have any sitting area
They don't accept credit cards either
I bring everyone who vists me here to try the cookies
There great
Make sure to ask the guy if they have any fresh out of the oven?
The chocolate brioche is SO good - I am addicted
Sourdough was also very good
A bit pricy but a wonderful treat!
while their roast beef sandwiches are also wonderful, their cookies are the best in New York City, especially the peanut butter chocolate
And, delicious breads!!
I've bought cookies from this place, very good! Once I ordered 12 cookies to be delivered and was charged $100
Cookies in store are $2 each, so it would have made more sense to pick up the cookies and send it by FedEx myself, would have been much cheaper
They charge a premium for delivery
My mistake
ordered delivery and pizza arrived cold and gross
Was covered in raw onions and what I guess was sausage
we ordered Sausage w/ onion, well done
the worst pizza in my life and I lived in BOston and Maine
This is your typical thai restaurant, with your typical thai dishes like pad thai and papaya salad
Unfortunately, it's just that
The food is ok, and the price is average or cheap, depending on what you get
I go there for the lunch special, and even that, the price has been increasing slowly
Don't think I haven't noticed
I've also noticed that sometimes the same dish I really enjoyed, wouldn't taste as great other times
I never know what to expect
The food is spicy and flavorful
But nothing unique or creative in the dishes
Sometimes this is the BEST food and others
well, it just sucks
The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair
But, hey, there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria
So, again, give it a try
I recommend ordering in on a weeknight
Apparently, the good cook works then
Good Chicken w/ peanut sauce, but my friend's mixed sqewer dish wasn't that great: it's chicken was a lil dry and the shrimp a lil too salty
But the coconut rice was good
Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic
Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished
It was raining, and we figured why not? The interiors are warm, tables lit by candlelight, patrons happily eating and praising the wait staff and cook constantly
pretty rare to see
and strange
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken
The chu chu curry was really delish but the pad thai
unbelievable
and a large portion too! The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy! Only boo was the rice
i think it is called jasmine rice but not sure, had a dry texture to it
seemed like left over rice
But other than that
not bad at all!
One of the best Thai Restaurant
Good services
Good Price
Food was Delicious and Testy
You better try Lab-Ped (Spicy Duck Salad
),Pad Thai,Tom yum Kung,etc
Only had delivery so can't speak to ambience, but considering the lack of attention they give the food, there certainly can't be much to see there

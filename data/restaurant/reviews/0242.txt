I made it to the bar to get 2 glasses of Merlot and before I paid, our table was ready
We sat upstairs, had a great view and the food was PHENOMENAL! We ordered Crab and Corn velvet bisque soup and then lobster dumplings for appetizers and for the main course, we both ordered the Strip Steak which was to die for
It was on a bed of sliced portebellos and the steak was in strips with the killer sauce
there were sides of new potatos and asparagus, and then for dessert we had some chocolate explosion with espressos
Going back in December on next trip - It was that good!
Visiting from London and in moment of insanity tried out Tao
Arrived early, dismayed at customers shoved in like cattle
Handed some vibrating device (the only thing htere that might have given me any pleasure) Ordered by Euro wanna-be host to wait
Well, we waited while suits tried to pick us up
Finally 6ft, ice goddess, waitress, came to show us to our table, and strode ahead not checking if we were keeping up, didn't ask me to put out my cigarette but tried to REMOVE it from my mouth herself! Very odd
Our waiter was nice but ill-informed and the food, well, I've had better at local take-out
Noise level way too high, prices too high , and by this point the much hyped Buddha and decor was looking very much like Thailand's answer to Planet Hollywood
Don't think I could recommend this place and have a clear conscience
I've been to Tao a half a dozen times and have only had good experiences
Could potentially be due to the fact I've gone at lunchtime
The atmosphere is absolutely sexy, the service is pretty good and the portions are healthy
Chilean Sea Bass Satay for appetizer is a great start
For entree I always go for sushi and have been satisfied everytime
Once I had the sake glazed lobster which was delicious
A little pricey but worth it
This is one of my fave places in this city
I have been five times now, and I love it
Yes
you do have to make a reservation waaaaay in advance, and it is always crowded, but what is wrong with that? The food, winde, drinks, and ESPECIALLY the desserts are phenominal
The ambiance is wonderful and full of energy, and you have to want a great scene to enjpoy this restaurant
Service has been wonderful each time, and the bar scene is perfect after or before your meal
Take out-of-town friends, and they will be impressed!
I called to make a reservation they made me hold for 5 minutes before attending to my call
I arrived at Taos on the Friday night gave the host my name and he looked at me blankly and said
there is no reservation under the name
He did not even apologise for their mistake, instead he said if we like he could seat us in 2 hours time and proceeded to ignore us
Finally when we were seated we had a waiter who did his best to push up the check by recommending over priced things on the menu
The waiter service was average, food good but not worth the price and the host at the front desk was absolutely disgusting
I highly recommend not wasting your time or money at Taos, mostly due to the rude service
Being asian, i found this place to be rather interesting with no visible asians working for Tao
Eh, don't get me wrong, i'm not screaming equal rights or anything
I think the food was mediocre
the waiter was nice enough to make some some recommendations that were ok
i would hardly say that the food itself was worth it
go with friends after you've had a night of drinking and have the munchies
You'll enjoy it a whole lot better
sorry Tao people
Come here if you want to pay 5 times the price of chinese take-out for food of the same quality
Redeeming factors are the huge buddha and high ceilings
Decor is cool - very Bali feel to satisfy the city-weary
The food is quite delicious, but it is expensive for what it is
While the decor is interesting and unique, the restaurant is so packed and there is a long wait even for those with reservations
Although the atmosphere is top notch
the Chinese food is sub-par
I recommend Le Colonial around the block
The space is really impressive, although I have some issues with it
I had heard that it was designed by a Feng Shui designer and I just doubt that because the tables are so crowded
However, the space really is impressive - the big Buddha is fabulous, the tall ceilings are dramatic, the tables and whatnot are really attractive, etc
The food is really quite good too
Some of the crowd is quite hip
The service is also a bit impatient ince it's so crowded - which is annoying since we had a reservation and still had to wait
It's certainly a bit pricey though - try and go on an expense account!
Tao was so much fun! The drinks were great
the food was great
and the service was even better! Definitely a must in New York City! The entire place is amazing and the chocolate cake is to die for! They even serve chocolate fortune cookies! Just make sure to make a reservation or expect a LONG wait!
My first experience at Tao was less than stellar, so I figured I'd give it another shot
Went with a large group and we shared
To start with, the hostess and wait staff should get rid of their pretentious fake European accents
Appetizers were standard fare - boring and bland - all of the dipping sauces tasted the same
Main courses also all tasted similar - way too heavy on the soy - incredibly salty
They really pushed the Kobe beef - if I'm going to have Kobe you can bet I'm not having it here!
I'm not sure how this place got bad reviews from anyone- it was wonderful the night I went! We walked in and got a table immediately despite the crowd, and the hostess was extremely friendly
Our waiter was also helpful and gave us suggestions for our meal


the drinks were delicious, as was the food
The crispy tuna sashimi and the satay chilean sea bass were especially good! The atmosphere is interesting, to say the least
I've must say I've never before dined beneath a giant glimmering buddha statue- it was somewhat surreal, in a good way
Check it out!
This was probably the worst expensive meal, I have had in a long time
$180 for spare ribs you wouldn't even find in a take out place in Montana, spring rolls that were made last Spring, sushi that tatsed like it was cooked, and fried rice that should have been called dried rice
Not even priced right at $12 a person
This is a great place for large groups
The food is great and you are always guaranteed to have a good time
That huge Budda and the music is really great! A good size place, lots of people, fun, hip, trendy
Food is very exotic and good
Nice place to go and hang out for a while but not for the entire evening
Took my wife here for her 40th, came from Philadelphia for a fun evening in NYC
Decor is interesting and nice but the food was strictly average
It tended to be overly seasoned resulting in clumsily made dishes
Tao is a direct take-off of Steven Starr's Buddakan in Philly BUT, it's not nearly as good
Philly 1, NYC 0
Tao may have a nice crowd, but it doesn't deserve it
On a quiet night, we sat at the bar and ordered drinks and Osakame (best of Sushi chef, which costs $55 for one person)
Five minutes after we ordered, the snotty bartender asked us to pay in advance so that she could close
When the sushi came, it was a joke
The sushi was small and cheap (shrimp, mackerel and smoked salmon were all on the plate)
It looked like sushi deluxe at the GO Sushi chain
Shame on them
okay, gorgeous scenery, bad serive and sketchy older crowd
Food was inventive but the atmosphere was not consistant
The waitstaff was friendly and the decor is interesting and fun
The food, though, was some of the worst and most over-priced I've had since I moved to Manhattan 6 years ago
The food was all over-spiced and wannabe trendy, just like the crowd
For prices like these, you may as well go to Nobu

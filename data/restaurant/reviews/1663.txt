I like it so much -- that out of all the restaurants in the city -- I picked it for my b-day dinner spot
The waiter forgot to put in our order so the food was 30 mins late and when it did come, one of the dinners was the wrong entree
We decided to split the correct one, which was average at best
Go to Frank instead
Ignore the negative reviews!  If you are looking for good JAPANESE food, not american-japanese food, go here!  My friends and I were seated right away on a weekend
While on a holiday it was overbooked for our large party of 9
a party of 4 is easy to find seats for
We ordered around 5 appetizers, 1 large dish, and 3 small dishes
We all shared since it was a lot of food
Sharing means we all picked from the same plate ala asian style! The bill came to about $40 with tax and tip
That is AMAZING for a Japanese restuarant
We also ordered Sake, cocktails, and japanese beer
That bill came to around $41 dollars which amused us to no end! When I say we drank, I mean we had around 2 carafes of mid range sake, 3 cocktails, 2 sodas, 1 beer
All in all, cheap and good food
I tried a beef dish
I believe it was like a soup
It was huge and excellent
My friends had squid, beef, veggies, fish
I have been to many american japanese restuarants and I loved this one even more!
a party of 2 w/o a reservation who came after us got seated before us
the food was horrible
we got a 'japanese pancake' that was just eggs and misc stuff tossed together and smothered with tonkatsu sauce
octupus balls that were dough smothered in tonkatsu sauce with a tiny chunk of octupus
we should have waited for a table at go across the street or gone to crif dogs instead
ive been here a few times and have always been happy
its farther east on st marks so its less crowded than yakitori/taisho, or kenka
pitchers of kirin are cheap (~$13)
theres a great deal of variety and specials so get a bunch of small plates to go with the alcohol
i highly recommend their fried food! spring rolls ($5) are tasty fried translucent skins stuffed with vegetables and seafood
beef potato croquettes ($5) are satisfyingly salty
slightly seared raw beef ($7) comes nicely marinated and with a side of spicy sauce
omu rice (chicken onion tomato rice wrapped in an omelette) is a cheap ($9) way to fill up
sushi is ordinary stick with the regular bar food
service is attentive
yesterday, 3 of us split 5 dishes and a pitcher and the bill came out to be $50 (including tax and tip)
not bad at all!
The negative reviews stunned me
I love Typhoon
I've always found the staff very polite, but maybe that's because I make an effort to pronounce dishes correctly and be polite back
I can imagine if you just want some sushi (and you think sushi = maki) and teriyaki, then yeah, you're going to be disappointed
But the fact that the restaurant is always filled with Japanese should indicate how good it is
Best of all, they have an extensive selection of sake and all of their liquor is really well-priced
This is the only restaurant I've found in the city so far that serves shochu cocktails
and they're $4
50-6
00 each! That's one of the cheapest cocktails in New York
If you want a treat, try the momohai (white peach flavoured shochu cocktail), because it is to die for
I used to trust City Search reviews but now I don't know
My bf and I read some of the good reviews on here and decided to check out Typhoon
Instead of a great evening out dining on some highly anticipated Asian-American cuisine, we ended up having one of the most frustrating, teeth-grinding, disappointing night of our lives
To top it off, the food was HORRIBLE! First of all, I think we could've seen Haley's Comet
TWICE
during the time we waited for our food
That wouldve been fine if the service was there to make up for it but the staff was INCREDIBLY rude! Finally, when our food came, it was so unpalatable that I wouldnt even dare to feed it to wild animals
I feel bad whenever I have to do this but I just feel like I have to warn other diners about this restaurant
Don't let the long wait fool you
The reason for the long wait is due to the uncomfortably small space
The staff is INCREDIBLY RUDE and once you are seated your food will take a very long time to prepare (even if the restaurant is partially empty)
Once we got our food, it wasn't any better than any sushi you would get at your local deli
My out of town guests were treated with the utmost disregard and we all had a very unpleasent experience
If you are a masochist and wanted to be treated with humiliation and with bad food, then this is the place for you
If not -- go to any other reputable resturant in the city
My bf and I love the food
The fresh slice of beef for the shabu shabu with great sauce--one is a radish-type of soy sauce, for $35
It's good for 2 people
Juicy fresh clams cooked in rice-wine for $8 (more than a dozen ); it has the best nabiyaki udon in the area with great soup base
The udon isnt the kind you can get in any Asian markets
Salmon cherishi (in half-size) is good portion with hugh chuck of fresh salmon for about $8 as well
I'd recommend to order the hot food--really is comfort food The atmosphere is noisy and , at times, some people can be rowdy after they're bit drunk
Bad ventilation so it'd be the best to go there in winter
ALl in all, I would recommend to anyone who is looking for food that isnt fancy but cheap to comfort your stomach
By the crowds of Japanese students, you can tell that this is the place to eat - it's a lot of fun, you can try lots of different things and you really experience Japanese-style snack food
Do yourself a favor though, if you want sushi, go somewhere else
Order the whole fried flounder instead
We've been here several times
The food is consistently good, not to mention cheap
The service is good to great- always friendly
The one time there was a mistake with our order they brought out complimentary dishes while we waited! The decor is nothing special, but the private little party rooms look like fun if you come with a small group
Recommended
We can always count on them!
consitently great food at great prices and open til 4am except sundays
things you won't find anywhere else and it's great
The problem with most of the reviewers is that they don't understand Japanese Pub Food
It's greasy, non-pretentious, comfort food
The sushi there is average at best but why on earth would you go to Typhoon for good sushi? That's like going to an Irish Pub and expecting great steak! Get the rice bowls or the noodles, a cheap bottle of sake, and relax! The service is a little slow but they are always very polite
I lived in Japan for 5 years and this place brings me right back
(And yes
croquettes are always fried
)
This place is adorable
I came here with a friend a few days ago and had a great time
I would definitely come back to celebrate with a large group
The food's pretty good for the price
If you're looking for cheap grub and a fun atmosphere, this is the place to go
My japanes friend suggested me this place
In the beginning I was skeptic, but
food are great and the place is really suggetsive
You can eat on the floor if you are lucky enough to find the tw rooms available
Just try it!
The night we went, service could not be worse

don't come here if you require waiters that sprint to your table and hover around your table waiting for you to drop your napkin
But, really, you're not there for the service
You're there for the divine desserts! My only complaints were that is is a little crowded (too many tables for the space and too many waitressess probably), and if you come after 4 (when brunch is over) and you're hoping to get food before dessert (though there's no reason not to come JUST for the huge dessert selection), the menu is sparse
just $11 sandwiches and salads (which are good, though not outstanding
could get same/better for cheaper elsewhere
like Le Pain Quotidien)
Come here if you like Serendipity 3, but would rather wait 15-30 minutes for a table instead of 1-2 hours
Despite the slow service and crowd, I can't wait to bring my kids here again during our next visit to NY
We came on a Saturday afternoon when the place was packed
My sister warned me that the staff would look like model/actress wannabes waiting to be discovered, and that the customers were mostly Manhattan yuppies
Though she was right, we also found the place to be very welcoming to my kids who were 5 y
o
and 8 y
o
at the time
The customers acted as if they didn't even notice the only two children in the place - no dirty looks as expected
Our waitress made recommendations to the kids, and acted like to she really enjoyed serving them
Cafe Lalo has wonderful atmosphere and delectable desserts, but the lame, indifferent, and sub-par service ruins the experience
On a recent visit, we were told that the staff won't make a frozen coffee drink although they certainly made milkshakes and other blended drinks
No other explanations given
We waited nearly half an hour for a slice of tart and cannolis
Cafe Lalo should match the quality of its food and its reputation with competent, customer-friendly serving staff
Although they have an amazing variety of delicious desserts and drinks, avoid this place is you don't want to wait for more that 1/2 hour in a line of sardines getting shoved every which way
I have never been here when the place is not PACKED
Brought my parents here on a Sunday night to meet 2 friends for dessert and they were shoved, bumped and accidentally kicked a multitude of times
Plus they crank the music so you can't really casually talk - it's more like a scream to hear one another
The space is just too small for all the people
Plus the Japanese tourists that come in w/ video cameras to see the space is downright annoying
Avoid if you're not in the mood for huge crowds
the lemon cake was very dry
i think my girlfriend had cake w/nuts, whatever it was, it was dry too
a waitress pushed me out of the way so she could see the counter without one word
plus it was so crowded, back to back seating
what a waste of money and time!
I like this place and have been there at least 10 times
Ok, the service is inconsistent but the desserts are really the best in town
Ambience is lovely and the place looks magical at night
This place is a little hype, but the desserts are good and the ambiance is great - the place looks incredible at night
Its a fun place to go on a date or meet up with the girls
The service wasn't anything amazing (a little over your shoulder too much at times), but fine
The great variety or desserts is enough to satisfy all
A great sweet-tooth experience
Cafe Lalo is always a stop for me when I'm in NYC
Reading the rest of the reviews - it can be crowded
Best to go late at night, middle of the day, or when the weather is nice enough to sit at the couple of outside seats
But you can bet it wouldn't be this crowded if the desserts weren't damn worth it! To die for! Service is fine, generally friendly and as speedy as the crowds allow for
And again - their chocolate cake is just amazing, as is the key lime pie, the mud cake and oh so many other items
Yummy!!
NOISY,CROWDED, EXTREMELY RUDE STAFF
WAITRESSES SELF INVOVLED, DITZY
NOT WORTH THE EFFORT OF WAITING ON LINE
MANAGEMENT IGNORES COMPLAINTS
OBVIOUSLY THEY WILL THRIVE ON MOVIE BUZZ UNTIL WORD OF MOUTH GETS AROUND!
The ambience is nice
It's very festive
They have a great selection for dessert tastes good but not exceptional
Service sucks! Didn't get menu until we asked for it!
I stumbled upon this place one afternoon in the spring and loved it immediately
The place is typical NYC in size
On the day I found it Cafe Lalo was only half full and I still felt cramped
I have never been there on the weekend but I image brunch is busy
The menu is limited but considering it is only a coffee and pastry shop one can not expect much more than what they offer
The few deserts I've tried have been exceptional
The coffee menu could use a tweaking
And as previously mention by other reviewers the service is lacking
I wouldn't suggest this place during those peak times on the weekend but for a little something to eat after 2pm and before 5pm the place is perfect
Cafe Lalo is a waste of time
The place is loud, extremely crowded, the service inept, and to top it off the food isn't even that good! I'd only go again if I were in the area, walked by, and saw that it was empty
Even then I might still keep walking
Unless you feel a gripping need to eat where a Meg Ryan film was shot (and I think that's the reason most end up there), skip this one
Obviously, the last reviewer has never been to Paris, unless it was Paris, Texas; he's too busy working at Cafe Lalo
The service here is awful, waiting in excess of an hour for a slice of cake to be brought to the table
And the desserts? You can do much better in the city
waited 45 just to get our orders taken, and only after perstering the waitstaff about 10 times
Of course, we are given the wrong order
twice
After speaking to someone who claimed to be the manager, we left in disgust, without paying
Repugnant, loathsome, disgusting
A few of the milder terms to describe this glorified IHOP
Once we were seated at our crammed corner table still covered in what was probably Log Cabin syrup, we perused the menus, noticing a crunching sensation beneath our feet
Somehow, the previous patron had managed to spill Cheerios all over the floor, and -SHOCKER- no one bothered to clean up! We finally ordered and our waiter warned us that our eggs might take a while because they have to cook them seperately
Huh??? Literally 90 minutes later, our food arrived
We all ordered potatoes, but our waiter informed us oh, we ran out
Why don't you damn walk your lazy self to Gristedes or Zabars and pick some up then!? Annoying tourists, Upper West Siders wishing they were Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan, and ditsy staff- oh yes! run, don't limp, to Cafe Lalo!
Though the service is slow, it doesn't affect the quality of the food
Good place to hang out with your buddies
I agree with some of the comments ahead of me
Honestly Lalo is very small and when they're busy you may feel a little crammed-in
Also true, i wouldn't exactly describe the wait staff as speedy

but this coffee shop/restaurant is a must for anyone searching for a cozy spot to relax and a tasty bite to eat
I highly recommend their brunch
Okay, whoever goes here to eat dinner is crazy, no wonder they are complaining about the food, the weekend brunch is decent, like any other but you go here for coffee, desserts, and their after dinner liquor selection! I love the cheescakes, coffee alternatives and four page dessert menu here! amazing place for an after dinner get together for coffee with friends or a significant other! The serice is slow to meet the nver ending line out the door of hungry customers, so be prepared
Having waited over 30 minutes for an order, which when finally delivered wasn't what we had asked for, we were told by the waitress that she was too busy to get our correct order
We complained to the manager, who it turns out, was ditzier than the waitresss (but, to give her a little credit, not as rude)
I had heard so much about this place, and have to say that I have never been treated so rudely in all my life
The food is okay (but the slices have definitely gotten smaller and the prices, higher)
The SERVICE is the WORST I've ever experienced in my 8 years of living in NYC!!! The waitress got our order wrong THREE times
She had the gall to say I'm too busy when I asked her YET AGAIN to bring me the correct order!!! (I wanted to tell her that she's busy precisely because customers like me are there--which will change soon enough
) I'm sticking with Cafe Mozart--which has the same desserts, bigger slices, and lower prices!

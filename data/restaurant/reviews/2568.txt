I made a reservation and expressed that it was my wedding anniversary
I received no acknowledgement of such
Besides my lobster tail was bland
Overall we both said the food was not what we expected
Everything at this place was a turn off
Starting with the lousy know-it-all, talking behind our backs-so we could hear, totally unaccomodating waitress
to the sparing salads to the VERY pompous, sarcastic, and even more unaccomodating manager, this place just STANK! Go here if you want to join the snobbery
It was a major dissapointment for our family who had finally found time to get together, and were greeted by absolutely disgusting food and ambiance
At least the theatre was good that night
I went to B
Smith's in October 2004 with a mid sized group
The food was excellent, the service was good, and B
Smith's husband was present came to the table to welcome us and offered complementary champange
A very romantic place!! Would be excellent for couples, but I plan to visit again when I'm in New York
Arrived early, sat at the bar, the drinks were weak
Apps were good, the spicy chicken wings were tasty
I felt the menu was limited and a bit pricy for what was offered
We went for lunch and had the most wonderful catfish
The service was as elegant as the decor
I thought B
Smiths a very special restaurant
I must check out the Sag Harbor restaurant
We went to B
Smith's last Friday night for dinner for the first time
Overall it was nice, a little more expensive than I anticipated, but the food was good
Gotta try the shrimp scampi in mango sauce with the blackeye peas
Yummy!!!! Drinks were ok
It's a little loud and parking in that area is tough especially on the weekend
Smaller than it looks on the website, but the live band is good
The food was good, not great
However, the crab cakes are excellent The decor is inviting
A great spot for a romantic dinner
If you are looking for any soul food, this is not the place
The menu is limited and the selection isn't that great even for american cuisine
The setting is very romantic, good amount of distance between tables
The music selection is very good
If you are trying to impress your date, the ambience might gain you points but the food won't
After telling B's husband Dan that we visited at the recommendation of friends in Colorado, both Dan and B were completely welcoming, stopping by our table for a chat
They take a lot of pride in their restaurant and it shows
The food was delicious, and our server was both hospitable and knowledgeable
We had a lovely meal of seared ahi tuna with plantains before hitting the theater
It was fun to see B's photos both as a magazine cover model and with celebrities who have visited her restaurant
We were impressed and delighted, and we will most definitely be back during our next trip to the Big Apple
B
Smith's satisfied a picky 16 year old! What more can I say! We followed recommendations from friends who dined here in August and we enjoyed everything
Our food was good and the portions were perfect
One in our party said it was the best Osso Bucco he had ever eaten
For NY, it prices did not seem expensive
The place is beautiful, the service excellent, I've never had a bad meal and to me the prices are typical of finer dining in NYC! Ms
Smith's ribs are so delicious and tender they fall off the bone! The sauce was so good I was licking my fingers all the way home! My only problem is the live jazz: It is a nice touch but so loud you have to shout at the people you are dining with! I bring family, friends and recommend it highly
Judge for yourself and don't let one person's bad experience decide for you! I go there alot and love it!
Have been here before (and in Washington)
However, the quality of the food this time was analagous to Sivler Diner at three-four times the price
Menu reads well, but dishes do not deliver
Probably will not be back
Prompt, efficient service for pre-theatre in convenient location
As is the case in NYC, wine prices out of sight for what is offered
Me and a friend went to this restaurant about a week ago before going to a broadway play
The food was excellent you must try the curry crisp oysters they were wonderful
The staff was professional and attentive
I will be back many more times in the future
Great job B
Smith!!
My father treated us to dinner at B's for my little sister's birthday and it was GREAT! The atmosphere was wonderful, the food was delicious and so was the desert
I am so pleased with the place that I'm coming back with a group of out of town guests so they can feel the Vibes too
The wait staff was so nice and patient while we wated for my dad to park the car
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place to anyone who is looking for good food and want to WOW their date or firends
The restaurant's decor is quite nice and the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating of my large party that included a child
The food however was nothing spectacular, I wouldn't call it soul food and I'd warn you away from eating the collard greens - they were strangely sweet
As a major fan of B
Smith, I was very disappointed with her restaurant
The decor was beautiful but the food was average and over priced
Our server was MIA most of the time and the place barely had 10 people in it
Maybe I caught them on an off day but I was not impressed!
I was surprised to see this listed as a soul food resturant
Mrs
Smith may be Black, but in my circles, we have never nor will we ever consider this to be a soul food joint
However, the food and it's presentation has always been fantastic
An elegant, stylish place to dine
I do, however, miss the hot home-made rolls that used to be served when the place was on 8th Avenue way back when!
Just great! Price Fix menu is a great value
Delicious pate, creme brulee, chocolate mouse and might I just say everything! Absolutely loved it!
Just go for the sausage trees, and don't think about how each individual has to touch the meat--or how many individuals touched the meat before you
This place was great if you have a tremendous sense of humor and heartful of good will
The service was quite pleasant
My guest and I had a great, long dinner that was enhanced greatly from the bottle of drinkable wine and large cordials at the end
Great to have gone there, but to say I'll ever go again
let's just say it was like a ride a Disney: glad you did it but you're not going to do it again
A small, charming subterranean space with red checked table cloths, this place offers great vaule for money
Do not expect haute cusine
this is the food of France as the French prepare it and eat it themselves, on a daily basis
The prix fixe lunch, at $12
95, may be the best deal in NYC
I had the ris de veau (sweetbreads), along with the charcuterie and the basket of raw veggies with dip and pate, and they were wonderful!
We were served totally uninspired food that was way overpriced
Dry salmon, boring garlic chicken-nothing was better than average
For $21, you can eat like royalty
This little French place offered good service and tasty food at a very reasonable price
The roast duck was great, chicken piccata even better
Chocolate mousse for dessert was good as well

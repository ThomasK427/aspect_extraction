not even close
not falling off bone as should be
disappointed

B was a decent experience
The food had good taste and was decent quantity
I would definitely recommend the onion rings as one of the sides
I had to try the sweet tea, which was served in a plastic cup at room temperture
Strike #1
Save yourself, Lipton is better
Our meal of 1/2 chicken and short end of ribs was tasty
The chicken was missing something, a little bland-but the BBQ sauce at the table was helpful
The ribs were tender and seasoned well
The white bread slices reminded me of school lunch, but were a welcomed surprise
I would have loved some Apple or Peach Cobbler, but fried oreos were the only option
Ill
Don't bother taking any of your vegetarian friends and if you're trying to impress get the bottle of Dom
A decent value and definitely better than Dallas BBQ
We 1st tried RUB a few months ago we're hooked! The food is amazing
The 1st thing we ever tried was brisket
Each time we come back we try something new
We love the pastrami, ribs, smoked chicken wings, the pulled pork is heaven! For sides, we love the greens, mayo coleslaw, seasoned fries
Service is great
The food arrives quickly our servers always check with us to make sure we have everything we need
There's only one dessert (my boyfriend ordered it I thought he was nuts), fried oreos! But I have to admit they're yummy
My ONLY complaint is the sides
They're great, I just wish there were more choices (like mac-n-cheese or mashed potatoes etc
)
maybe add on a few other dessets as well
Other than that, this place is perfect we'll keep coming back for the most awesome BBQ!!
RUB does a bang up job with the food
The service leaves a lot to be desired
Maybe I'm too much of a city snob, but there are plenty of actors out there who can pretend to be good waiters
The food deserves good service, and for the price you pay, customers deserve good service
Ventilation sucks, AC doesn't exists, Hostesses are clueless, Bartender didn't know what a Lynchburg Lemonade was (not the packaged kind), one toilet for the whole joint, tea in buckets on the floor, running out of ICE??? Fortunately for this place, the food is GREAT and is almost worth going through the hassles
When this heat breaks I'll be back
Thumbs up! Beef brisket - tender, although could have been smokier more moist
Pulled pork - excellent, very tender, already dressed with a vinegar sauce
Smoked sausage - pretty good
Brooklyn White Ale - excellent, reminded me of Celis white ale from Texas
Great beans, tasty greens although bit too salty
Nice portion size - I was unable to finish the 3-meat combo platter
Service was good too
If the brisket were smokier, this place would be great!
As close to authentic BBQ as you can get in NYC
Yummy eats and that fried oreo treat was to die for
A deep fried delicacy
My sister had the duck over salad and said it was worth every calorie and penny
I had the pastrami and beef brisket platter with the onion straws and the vinegar slaw
There wasn't a crumb left on that big silver plate
Loved that there were real southern sodas in the machine - RC Cola is a favorite
My sister thought the tea tasted home brewed and she had 1/2 sweet 1/2 tea just like another reader suggested
I'll be back for ribs and pulled pork - and more of those amazing oreos
Ate at RUB last night and everything at the table was great! Brisket is a little dry, but fall-apart tender and just fine with RUB's awesome bbq sauce
Pulled pork is delicious, as are the baked beans and the vinegar based cole slaw
The onion strings are just plain addictive
I'm from Houston, and the meats at RUB aren't nearly as smoky as what I'm used to in Texas, but that's not necessarily a negative - they taste great! Another reviewer complained about smelling like smoke after eating at RUB
Yes, it's a little smokey, but you shouldn't be eating bbq if you're worried about that
I've walked out of other NYC bbq joints because they DIDN'T smell like smoke
On my first visit I tried out the pastrami (too salty -- and I like salt) and brisket (nicely smoked and quite moist for a dryish cut of meat)
The fries were decent, baked beans were impressive with lots of meat and a distinctive multi-layered taste which left with a nice rich peppery aftertaste in my mouth
Second time went back for the ribs (and beans!)
The ribs come in long and short end, the former -- which I had -- are apparently meatier
They arrive in their dry rub, without sauce (which you can add)
They're smokey, slightly spicy, slightly fruity, and tender without being the least greasy
Unlike most ribs, which are chewy, or fatty, or smothered in sauce, these are meat
I still like the other ribs, maybe even better, but these are definitely worth a try
this place is going through the typical startup hiccups but the food makes it all the worthwhile
we had the pulled pork sandwich and pastrami along with the baked beans and fries
delicious! succulent meats with seasoning that brings more flavor as opposed to overwhelming as is typical
staff is friendly while making their best effort
RUB should be in top form soon
i expect the food to only get better (if this is possible)
It's a shame that the food does not compare to the excellent and friendly service
The brisket was VERY dry and tasteless, likewise the chicken
Fries good
The place is not well ventilated AT ALL
All my clothes stunk of smoke after being there only 15-20 minutes
I would not go back because of this
I'm not a baked bean fan, but damn! Their baked beans melt in your mouth with bits of brisket adding tremendous flavor
I agree with the prior review that the pulled pork is out of this world and we haven't had a chance to try the babyback ribs yet! They're sold out each time
Everything else we've tried, (chicken, ham, brisket) has a delicious, smoky flavor
You won't be disappointed!
Simply not good enough
Too many other dining options in NYC to settle for this
The Scene The century-old dark wooden columns painted with quaint, folkloric designs summon a medieval, Alpine atmosphere
Wine is everywhere: Bottles line every available nook, chandeliers are fashioned from decanters, and service loves to make a show of priming glasses and grandly presenting the 50,000-bottle tome
The crowd of oenophiles, 5th Avenue shoppers, and European business types don't need prodding to drink it all in
The Food The love of wine overflows into the kitchen, as it pops up all over the menu, from a Chateaubriand with Rosso Di Montalcino sauce to an asparagus and egg salad tossed in red wine vinaigrette
The signature risotto cooked in Amaone is especially intoxicating, with the vintage lending a deep claret color and unique richness to grains
A top-quality balsamic vinegar, drizzled tableside on branzino as it is de-boned, adds vigor to the light fish
Need to sober up? Try the affogato, espresso poured over creamy vanilla gelato
Great ambience, great wine selection, fresh and delicious dishes, and spectacular gelati! But what started as very attentive and friendly service started to disintegrate as the restaurant started to fill up
It took us half an hour to get the attention of our waiter to order dessert and another 15 minutes to ask for the bill after dessert
Despite this difficulty, I would still go back considering everything else was wonderful
I just relocated from Italy
Coming in this wonderful restaurant moves me everytime
If you think that Italian food is sauces, meatballs, seasoning and parmigiana, please don't come here
Because this is one of the few restaurants in New York where you can eat real italian gourmet cuisine

The fruit fondue dessert was the perfect ending to a perfect meal
I will definately be going back to Andavi very soon
My friend gave Andavi a solid recommendation
I ate here last Monday and my experience was just wonderful
I took my parent from out of town
They were awed by the nightlife on Christopher Street as well as the courteous service
Our food was filling and well prepared
If you're a wine afficionado, you'll be in your glory here
Lots of rare imports
had dinner not to long ago , friend took me there
it just wasn't good, don't know were to begin
being in the food business i've had bad meals before but this was just terrible
chicken with brie? tough as nails, lobster ravioli , tasteless ,you can tell by the food that is served there isn't a culinary wizard back there
all these good reviews seem misleading now that ive been there
the manager was nice profecional and service was average but the food was not italian, a diner is better, try po'
While traveling to New York city on business, I went to CitySearch to help me find the perfect restaurant for my last dinner
I tried Andavi and experienced stellar service, a trendy -- yet relaxing -- lounge-like atmosphere, delicious food that was put together in the most creative ways, and a beautiful and inexpensive wine list
Andavi is the perfect restaurant in a jewel of a neighborhood
When in New York, make this a stop
Theyve earned each and every one of these reviews
Excellent food, romantic atmosphere, service was excellent
Aside from tasting better, the food was exceptionally prepared, and this place is an ace in the deck
A festive approach to traditional Italian, the service is warm and friendly without being annoyingly attentive, and the food is outstanding
Andavi is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in New York
it was very easy to get a reservation here which was refreshing but now i know why
once we were seated no one came to our table for what seemed like ages
finally they wanted to take our app order before taking our wine order, seemed like the waiter couldnt handle it all at once
apps were delivered and still no wine
then he served our red wine in white wine glasses telling us they were all out of red glasses when we could see them hanging on the bar - not good for a so called wine bar
i have never been to the olive garden but i swear the food there looks a hell of a lot better on the commercials than the food was at andavi
only decent thing on menu was mac n cheese balls
As an Italian, I critique from experienceand Andavi is Italian done right! Our food was well prepared, and the night didn't require applying for a loan
Our waiter took pride in owning his role, and accommodating us at all costs
I would however, recommend making reservations, especially on weekends; the place was pretty packed for a week night
I previously had a birthday dinner at Andavi last year and I found the waiters/waitresses to be courteous and friendly
However, I did not find this to be true in my second visit there
First after being seated for a while the waiters/waitresses never even came to ask if we wanted anything to drink
When I tried asking a waiter if we could order he responded by asking if I waited for more than 15 minutes and even asked if I was serious about the lack of service
He said he would take our order but never came back
It was a good thing the manager overheard my complaint since he tried to appease my growing disatisfaction by offering drinks on the house and asking another waitress to take our order
I still love the food and ambience but I think I'll pass on the service
I very rarely write reviews because I don't like to take the time but this place is worth it! Went there on Valentines day this year and the service was wonderful, the food is amoung the best I ever tasted and the price very reasonable
Very nice decor for romance and I would definetely travel the 50 miles again to my little favorite italian spot!Try the wine
Yummy!
Three friends and I visited Andavi on Saturday, October 30
I made reservations for 8:00 pm, but we ended up running late
I called the restaurant at 8:00 pm to let them know we would arrive in about 15 minutes and when we arrived, we were seated right away
The hostess was very friendly (both on the phone and in person)
Service was impeccable; I couldn't ask for more
The staff decor made me feel very comfortable
relaxed
And the food was EXCELLENT! Try the Bruschetta for an appetizer and Chicken Saltimbocca for dinner; both were delicious
Dessert was just right -portions are friendly
Prices very reasonable
A silver lining on the memory of my engagement party
My only complaint was the seating dimension was a tad on the tight side
The entree prices were suprisingly reasonable which didn't diminish the quality of food at all
The presentation was kept tight, which demonstrated that the staff was efficiently schooled on menu items and the benefits of a grand performance
They didn't waltz when asked specific questions on dishes, and manned our party of ten like pros
One evening I enjoyed their Lasagna
It was covered with sauce and very tasty
Another nite I had their more traditional fare
spaghetti with a special meat sauce
Again outstanding!
I've been here twice, and am still loving it
I hope word doesn't get out so they raise their prices!! The linguini was cooked perfectly al dente
I've sampled the herb-crusted salmon and a cool shrimp entree
They have an incredible selection of very innovative deserts, in addition to the food, service gracious and ambience romantic
This is a favorite location of mine for just about any special occasion
The food is top-notch and the service has never floundered
It's definitly one of the most exciting and unexpected dining experiences this city offers
Choosing a restaurant to spend your birthday at is tricky- choose the wrong place and your birthday could be less than happy
I chose Andavi to meet friends at for my birthday
It was affordable but elegant, the service was friendly but not overly formal
Our server, recognizing it was my birthday, brought dessert without being prompted and told us happy birthday from the staff
She put the extra attention in the service that makes Andavi the kind of place that you can feel confident about spending a special occasion
I highly recommend Andavi as a nice, casual, delicious place to meet friends
Saw the reviews and decided to head down and try it
From the outside it looked like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant
BUT, once I walked in, I realized it was a pretty hot dating spot for twenty-something singles
My pasta was fresh, our service came with that special smile, and the night was unexpectedly affordable
If you get past the location, you'll soon realize overly-priced uptown italian bistros have nothing on Andavi
I have a confession to make
I had always thought of the term Italian Cuisine as an oxymoron
The concept stayed true until my visit to Andavi
So many dishes seemed to disregard tradition's formula, with inventive twists in their recipes
I knew I was in for a treat
Everything was delicious and delicately presented
The decoration is simple but possesses a touch of elegance
I look forward to my next visit
The attentive wait staff took special care to make sure we got through our meal in time to get to the theatre afterward
This was some of the most expertly prepared, delicious meals I've had in this city
Considering the stellar reputation of this casual, in-demand dining room, the price was a pleasant surprise as well
This resaurant was fabulous! My husband and I met another couple friends of ours there for dinner and they also thought it was great! Food was incredible, even my picky eater husband loved the food
Wine was superb and service was exceptional
Our waiter was very attentive but not in our face, he seemed to know exactly when we needed him
I definitely plan to go again
We sat in the garden and even though it was small it had a great ambiance about it
Highly recommended
I recommend Andavi because of consistency in service, the quality of the food and the perfectly lit dining room and back garden

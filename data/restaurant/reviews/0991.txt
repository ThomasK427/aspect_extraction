I have never felt so foolish to believe the hype
What a disappointment
The decor is absoultely beautiful, the atmosphere is lacking
this was sincerely the single worst experience of my life
never go there
What an experience! Everything was perfect! Special thanks to the doorman who worked on 6th Feb 05 night who opened taxi door for us upon arrival and called a taxi for us when we left
Service was awesome
The waiter (Korean guy) gave us an in depth explanation of the menu
Food was fantastic
Every single dish was tasty, nicely arranged with special made utencils
Umami is highly recommended
Interior decor was beautiful and romantic
It was just perfect!
I have been meaning to try Megu for a while and was lucky enough to go there recently
I highly recommend experiencing this restaurant
The space alone is amazing, the overall decor is interesting and beautiful plus the table layout is brilliant; you never feel like you are sitting on top of your fellow diners
The service staff is extremely knowledgeable, kind and witty; questions are welcome and the suggestions provided were as amazing as described
The food itself is the crown jewel; the presentation is gorgeous and creative, the taste is sublime
Everything I ordered was a true culinary achievement
I recommend sampling the whole menu; it is a shame to miss out on any of the amazing offerings
The check is definitely dear, however, well worth it
Don't get me wrong, this place is definitely highly recommended
I love the presentation and quality of the food
The service was also excellent
I went to Megu twice and was impressed both times
However, my wallet was also lighten quick a bit
But in NYC, which top notch restaurant doesn't put a dent in your wallet
Definitely a must try if you've never been
Over priced
Don't worry about the organic food
The Kobe beef with peanut sauce is a must
As for the hot rock BBQ, I would rather have it at any traditional Korean places
Service was excellent, however
Its a shame that such a beautiful restaurant with such a phenomenal menu can provide such horrible service
It was the best meal that I've eaten in a long time, but the service was poor from the moment we walked in the door
From the unresponsive hostess to the unknowledgeable waiters, the sloppy service started when our waiter dropped one of the plates during the first course (which broke on the floor next to my foot) and then during the second course, when a lid from one of the dishes was dropped on my lap
The inattentive waiters never refilled our water glasses, never offered more drinks, our silverware was never replaced, and it took almost half an hour at times for them to clear our table after we finished a course
For a 4-star restaurant (not to mention a $400 dinner for two), attentive service is expected
food sucked
service sucked
based on sales and lies
never got what was promised
I love this place, I recommand it to all of my friends
My favor dish is the Froi Grar, I know it's very expensive, but where else you can find these super delicious food?
the place is amazingly beautiful! But for those prices i just dont think the food is good enough nor filling enough
To spend $25
00 on soybeans, thats ridiculous!!! I love sushi and asian food, and dont mind spending alot for the best, but this is not it
From the first moment that we walked into the restaurant, we were in awe
The space was magnificent and the hostess was extremely pleasant
We sat in the corner, but the ambiance was still excellent
I recommend the Chateaubriand which is worth every penny
The bar had a hip DJ and the crowd was ultra chic
We went upstairs for a cocktail after dinner and sat next to a supermodel
I will be back next weekend
I went here during their first week of operation last year and was terribly disappointed
But I thought maybe they had worked out some kinks, since most of the disappointment was service/operations related
Well no such luck
I was back again for a business meeting (would never spend my own cash on this place, as it is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced), and it still is without a doubt, the worst dining experience in Manhattan
From the moment you walk in (they really need to get rid of the hostess), the rudeness of service is palpable
Waiters seem clueless, orders seem to get mixed up (we were in a big group)
After about 30 minutes, they informed someone that they were out of Kobe beef, and he had to order something else (this, while brining out parts of other orders)
It is all just ABSOLUTE CHAOS
Food was a joke!!! Didn't see the hype about the quality of food at all
Portions are ridiculously small and expensive
Not a 4 star dining experience
Staff didn't offer to take our coats
Made us wait 10 minutes eventhough restaurant was empty
Tried to have us sit in a 4 seater for 5 people eventhough restaurant was empty
When asked why, was told the other tables are for just in case a party of 6 comes in btwn 6:30pm to 9pm! Felt like replying how about the other 40 open tables?! Eventually got a comfortable table after insisting by the time we left at 9pm, restaurant was still half empty
Quality of some food was good but not GREAT
Not impressed with any dishes
The expensive bill was not worth it at all
Not even for the space
After having one of the worst dining experiences ever, I feel I MUST write this review: Everything about Megu is OVER-produced! From the entryway, the soy-sauce guy to the wasabi guy - the whole place is a joke
The sushi was uber-fishy, the kalbi beef (cooked on a hot rock, on our already over crowed table) was steaming up our faces and clothes and wasn't that great
After sending two dishes back (which were NOT taken off our bill)
we finally decided to throw in the towel and forfeit our $1,100
00 (plus tip) to get the heck out of there w/out losing another second of our night in that ridiculous place
Their only redeeming quality is that they have successfully provided my friends and I with endless amounts of laughter over how over the top and silly that place is
This my first time to write feedback even though we eat out often
Megu was the WORST dining experience
Half way through our meal, the nice bottle of wine we ordered still didn't turn up
After asking several different people find our waiter, he returned to say he couldn't find any wine and begged us to order sake instead
We spoke to the manager but got NO APOLOGIES
After a wrong bottle and 20 more minutes they finally brought it out
They RUINED the enjoyment of our meal, took an hour to sort out the wine, then presented us with a $400 bill in which nothing- not even the wine- was comped or discounted
Plus the presentation of the food was not up to par
Stick to the tried-and-true top sushi places if you're willing to pay this kind of money
We left feeling RIPPED OFF
I would have rated this place Average if the prices were less than half of what they charged
Everything we ordered was ok, but definitely not exceptional, and especially not for that small portion
I was there with a friend, and we were still hungry after having 5 dishes plus dessert
Still the bill was close to $300(with 1 bottle of lower-priced wine)
The decor was like Disneyland where everything is eye-catching but cheaply made
The only reason to go there is that you can say I've been to Megu
I really wonder how long they will stay in business
SO dissapointed at my recent experience at Megu
For years, i've been part of a birthday group, where the birthday person selects an incredible restaurant (Blue Hill, Babbo, etc
) -- but not this time
While Megu is visually stunning, the service was horrible, the menu was frustrating (go from cold to hot to cold was the advice from the waiter, with the 12-page menu having no order to it), the noise level made it impossible to hear your friends sitting next to you, the portions (which are shared) were very small (pizza after?), and the prices were just stupid

Warming clam miso soup and expertly rolled Mexican maki (made with yellowtail, scallions, avocado, and jalapeno mayonnaise) pair well with a stiff glass of shochu, Japanese liquor with a bite as strong as tequila
Cooling green tea ice cream or decadent chocolate cake ends the meal on a sweet note
if i lived in new york i would take my clients here- its one of those types of places
food was good, service good- all a bit too pricy
surprised that not many people know about this place, the only way i found it was through user reviews on citysearch
Sashimi was ok (maki rolls tasted better)
Quiet and good without being too crowded and overrated
You will see me there again
One of the most important pieces of enjoying a quality meal is the ambiance
The sushi was excellent, but to compliment the great food was the fact that this restaurant is small and the noise level is low
You can sit there for hours enjoying your sushi and small selection of sake, and hear yourself speak! I've been to many 'trendy' Japanese restaurants in NYC where the food was above par, but it was crowded with teriyaki eaters and noise bouncing off the walls
This place is great for a low key evening for really great sushi and conversation
I went there about a week ago and everything was spectacular
We were seated as soon as we arrived
The service was great
Everyone was very nice and attentive
Most important of all, the sushi was delicious! When we went it was very quiet and romantic for two
I am definitely coming back!
Tried this place b/c of the NYT review, and regretted my decision
Initially I was excited that this place is located close to work/home-- I've always wanted a decent priced good quality japanese place that's convenient
However, I was disappointed
The food decent, but nothing special
Service was slow (asked for water about 5 times
and the flakey waitress looked at us confused
)
With so many great sushi places all over the city, why bother with this one? I'm highly critical of japanese food, and when it's good, I'll be the first one to go back there over and over again (En, Seki, Yama, Sakagura, etc)
SHIMIZU has the best sushi in NYC! Believe me
If you love sushi, you MUST go there
The Sushi at Shimizu is as good as you are going to find anywhere in NYC
The prices are reasonable and the service is just a notch under super
Good location, but due to its small size, could be hit or miss on waiting
Call ahead with a reservation and you should be all set
The Shochu selection is amazing and the prices are great
NYers can begin their Shochu education at Shimizu without breaking the bank
Plenty of kick for less than a martini costs, hell spend the money you saved on some more fish
Food-wise, this place can compete head to head with any top sushi place in NYC
Sit at the bar, and let Shimizu-san select the sashimi and sushi for you
The fish is so buttery and exquisite, I sometime go through a whole meal without using any soysauce
When we went, it was rather empty, which is a shame because this place deserves more attention
It has a peaceful, zen-like atmosphere and they have a great selection of fish
We liked that there were variations on the toro or the clams
The fish was fresh and heavenly!!! We really enjoyed ourselves here and would definitely go back again!
I love sushi and have always had to trek all the way to the east side for any decent sushi
Shimizu just recently opened and it's fabulous
Not only that the quality is slowly getting better (I think they may be upgrading their fish now that there are more customers)
The best thing is that it's BYOB (until they get their license) so more bang for the buck
If you're a real sushi person - order the omakase at the sushi bar and you will never be disappointed
Went here with my roommates one morning for brunch and never experienced such poor service in a long, long time
for what its worth, the food was wonderful, but i'd have liked to get my napkin with my meal instead of my check
definitely a place to go if you have the entire day to waste
If you go there - head to the back and sit in the garden! The bean dip is awesome! Other then that - be prepared to wait for a long time!!! I have been there 3 times now and each time the service is very slow
The other food is ok - but nothing great
The burgers are ok - but the last time I went there they took about 20 minutes to bring us soda, my fries came with what seemed like an entire salt shaker full of salt on it
basically only go here if you are looking to be out to dinner for at least 2 hours if not more!
i stumbled across this place yesterday for dinner
we were very impressed! loved the decor and our food was delicious
the waitstaff were very nice and attentive
we wanted to try everything on the menu, but would definitely recommend the fried fish club
new neighborhood favorite!
The food is better than average
My appetizer size plate of braised short ribs (with mashed potatoes and greens) was a meal for me
On the down side, the homemade biscuit that came with it would make a good paperweight
My girlfriend's fish sandwich was huge and she said it was good
The specialty drinks are weak and nothing to brag about
The service was slow
Also, there are no pepper shakers on the table as they have a pepper grinder
But, the waitress didn't offer it
We had to ask if they had any pepper
The lady at the next table ordered chicken and it came undercooked
She received a gift certificate but I think she had to pay for the meal anyway
Weird
I say go for the food (maybe not the chicken) and then hop down the block to The Five Spot for a good drink
Dinner at Maggie Brown's was amazing
I came back for brunch and it was even better!! If you live in the Ft
Greene/ Clinton Hill area-- it can't be beat!! Run, run, run to Maggie Brown's!!!
Went to Maggies one saturday night with the family and LOVED it the coktails are fun and different and the food was great
I recommned the pasta with the white truffle sauce and the brie appetizer
overall good atomophere and understanding staff
i would definately recommend this place
After reading reviews, went here for Sunday brunch
The place is very small, you can hear everyones conversation, but the decor is funky, exposed brick, antique touches, and the waitstaff is extremely down to earth
As for the food, brunch was average, I would not get the same dish again, and they were slow to serve us
Will try it for dinner if I'm in the area again
The Scene The restaurant packs Brooklynites in so tight that tables must be moved to allow for seating
But no one scrunched into the Havana-styled space seems to care, a testament to the authentic flavors
Food service moves quickly, but drinks can be slow going
The Food The handwritten menu lists a host of Cuban and Latin American specialties, all under $10
Start with a double order of the crispy coconut shrimp, but skip the overcooked corn cob topped with chipotle mayo
Entree choices seem endless--braised beef, pounded chicken, garlic shrimp, poblano chile, hanger steak-- the platter of subtly spiced pulled pork, served with whipped plaintains, is the restaurant's best
The Cuban sandwich is small in size but big on flavor thanks to tender, smokey roast pork, sliced ham, melted Swiss and a pickle for tang
Instead of the so-so tres leches, opt for another round of devilishly good caiparenhas
When you're bored with all the Asian food in the area and want a refreshing change, head for Cubana Cafe
They might not bring the mojitos, but the rest of the menu is tasty and inexpensive
Don't forget to order a side of sweet plantains (with spicy mango salsa), and enjoy the empanadas (with chic pea salad on the side)
Mmmmm!
I really should not be writting this as I live in the hood and would rather keep the secret to myself, but I just ca't help it! Small? True
But this place has thrived
An alternative to dinner would be lunch or even breakfast
Dave and I had the place practically to ourselves yesterday around brunch time and enjoyed a feast
I had the Cuban version of Eggs Benidict (#41 on the menu!) made with spicey slices of choizo on soft Cuban bread covered with two perfectly poached eggs and a sauce that needs to be tasted to be believed

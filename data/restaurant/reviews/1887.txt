You have to wake up from the table and pick up your dish when ready
The quality of pasta is amazing
Do not miss the delicious home-made Tirmisu'
This is one of those knooks with right off the boat eats, with a great balance of humor and AMAZING tasty food at such a reasonable price
You'll leave in a lovely full state!!!
Excellent food
fast, quick
delicious sauces
Good value for money--especially the $7 lunch special for 2 courses
come on
where else can u get such good food
This person who gave Peppe Rosso a 1 is insane!!! Sapore?!?!?! Please!!! Anyway, working so close to Peppe Rosso I have had pretty much everything on their menu and everything is excellent, from the panini's to the pasta, all fresh and delicious! And as far as the service, it's a To-GO spot, what do you expect, a bunch of hand holding??? In and out with amazing food, it's that simple
I love Italian food but this place is the pitts! There are far better (and cheaper) Italian restuarants in this city, like Sapore in the West Village for instance
Pepe Rosso to Go has flavorless food and rude service
So good that there are no words
A friend of mine from Italy took me there for the first time several years ago and I do back whenever I can
It's tiny, and take out is harder if you live far away, but it's really, really, really worth it
If they still make their orange salad, you should try it
It's definitely some of the best Italian food I've ever had
this is my favorite italian place in the city
ever since leaving rome after living there for a while, i was on a neverending search for good, cheap, fresh, authentic italian
and i finally found it w/ pepe rosso
not much of a sit-down dinner place, but great for getting a quick lunch or bite to eat
friendly service w/ native italian speakers; wonderful authentic pastas w/ fresh bread and plenty of parmigiano
Great food, especially the carpaccio with the most amazing cheese
The signs around the place are funny on the first reading (probably even more so for tourists) but irritating a second time around
Food is very good, great price, and great atmosphere
Cant get a better deal
I ate here with my Brasilian girlfriend and she said muito bom - adoro voce! when we left
This is really the best Italian food that I have ever eaten outside of Italy! So good! The staff is really funny and the food is inexpensive
For the price, I can't think of a better Italian restaurant in NYC
Though restaurant may be stretching it since there are only four tables (six or eight when the weather is nice and they open it up to sidewalk seating)
There are almost always Italians from Italy eating, talking and drinking here
Always a good sign for an Italian restaurant
Haven't had a bad pasta dish, though the bolognese sauce can sometimes get a little watery
Rosso is the best of the Pepe take-out joints
I almost don't want to rate this b/c I want it to remain a best kept secret
the food is great--it makes you feel good to eat well
definitely enough to fill you up
the salmon lunch special is amazing! the ambiance DOES need help, but you don't come here for that
enjoy!
Food is great
Healthy
Ambience needs much improvement, but not necessary
Place to go with friends for a casual bite to eat
Sad to see they are going cheesey with the new neon sign and cheap signs on the sidewalk
The place had more charm without them
Just found out that Quantum Leap has a new and big V
G
Burger selection
I think they must have a dozen variety
I ordered the Grilled Salmon Burger and my lady had the Garden V
G
Burger
they're jumbo and even served with a plate of salad
the toasted organic whole wheat bun is good
My lady especially raves about their Carrot Ginger dressing
For that price of $5
95 (Samon Burger) and $4
95 (Garden Burger) who can beat that
It really worth the trip!
Since I was first introduced to Quantum Leap, I've found myself back a few times a week, relaxing to food that left me feeling satisfied and healthy
The weekend brunch cannot be missed, I recommend the waffles, pancakes (with that blueberry topping!), and homefries especially
I have been going to Quantum Leap for several years now
The food is always fresh and very tasty
The vegetables are not overcooked and the food is seasoned nicely
Some people think healthy means bland-not at Quantum Leap-even meat eaters would like this place
Everything is reasonably priced and servings are generous
The ambience is lacking, but when the food is this good, I can overlook it
We have dined here at least 10 times in past three years
It has gotten very, very expensive
Our last experience: Waiting for a table at the bar (we always make reservations), the bartender ignored us until my husband intervened with one of the owners
Next, the maitre d' looked clearly inconvenienced when we brought our drinks with us
I have been watching their maitre d' for awhile and he is the main reason we will probably not return
He has become increasingly rude and if you are female and don't humor him, he ignores you when you speak! (There are no female employees at all in the place -- kind of odd
) To be fair, some of the other wait staff are just fine
Great ambiance but it has been shattered by its excessive pricing and a maitre d' who is arrogant
Carafe wine is very
borderline?
My wife, son I were in the city and had a great meal at E M
It was quiet, perfect lighting, and the service was the best
We just sat down when the bread water arrived, which we quickly finished off
More was brought without asking
The soup was very hot which melted the cheese perfectly and warmed us up
Nothing worse than lukewarm soup
The water glass never made it past the mid mark as our waiter was quick to refill
The main course was delicious, not overfilling
If you just have an entree, you will still be hungry, but for us with the bread and soup, we could not handle dessert
Next time we'll leave room, they looked great
A little pricey, but since it was a treat to come to the city, we were ok with that
Certainly got our monies worth
This is one of the best kept secrets in the village, and Italian dining in the City
The service is impecable, the food a delight and the chocolate mouse cake maybe be the richest in town
The Scene Since 1994, the Cub Room--named for the legendary Stork Club's exclusive VIP area--has hosted Soho's chic-and-trendy set
The tall, window-wrapped corner lounge, with its plush, honey-toned banquettes and wood bar, is still the perfect place for after-work cocktails
The dining room's elegantly-appointed tables and corporate high-rollers seem a world away from the newer cafe attached next door
With brick walls, fruit-filled wicker baskets and vintage posters, it's a sunny spot for casual meals
The Food One kitchen, three menus
On the high end, New American dishes feature roasted chicken with spaetzle and rabbit ravioli
The parsnip-short-rib dumplings are rich and tender; flavorful grilled hanger steak and the cafe's bacon-wrapped meatloaf are sure bets

Thanks for the wonderful evening
I keep coming back to this cozy and amicable hell's kitchen Italian trattoria because it's got the best of both worlds, food wine
Prices are so affordable for the quality and consistency of their dishes and their wine list is so unique and versatile
They have wine from Italy that will blow your mind, and enhance your food experience, without breaking your bank
I am preatty confident to say that I found the best deal in this area
Enjoy the restaurant after theatre crowd, the ambiance is just right
this place is unbelievable for amazing prices! Avoid before theatre it is crowded and noisy
I always hit this place after 8:30 pm
The food is the best cheap Italian in the neighborhood and has fantastic ambiance
My family and I discovered Cara Mia this year and since then it has been our favorite hang out place besides our own living room
The only negative thing is that the food made my mother jelous because it's really as good as hers
When in the mood for fresh pasta and good inexpensive Italian wine we always go to Cara Mia and know that we'll be treated right
The service is prompt and attentive and if you're not going to a show, after the pre-theatre crowd is gone, this place is a little gem
I have been to Cara Mia so many times in the last 2 years and I have never been disappointed of service food and atmosphere
The food is delicious but most important, always consistent
They have the most friendly staff and the management has always made us feel at home
They treat people like guest instead of mere customers and they give you the real home feel
Honestly if anyone gets disappointed they need to look at how they behaved
Act like a guest and you'll be treated like a king at Cara Mia
It's a pity when what should have been (and would have been) an excellent dining experience is marred by a rude, arrogant maitre d'
This young man publicly reprimanded us for tearing off a section of the protective paper tablecloth so that we could fold it into a wedge to steady our wobbly table
What do you think you're doing? I never heard of such a thing! he huffed
There are people to fix those things, people who WORK HERE! And with that he snatched the torn paper from the table, crumpled it up, muttered under his breath, and had the table re-set
Did we really commit such a heinous faux pas, a breech of etiquette so unforgivable, that we deserved to be humiliated? That kind of disrespect wouldn't surprise me at a fast food restaurant, but it astounded us at a supposedly upscale restaurant like Cara Mia
Cara Mia offers delicious and creative Italian cuisine with excellent service and ambience
They specialize in homemade pastas (be prepared to see at least 6 pasta specials on any given night), as well as a variety of meats and fish
Ive been there a few times
Both their lobster and steak specials are fantastic  Cara Mia is a great place to take a date for dinner and its very close to the theater district
Most of the time, Italian restaurants are too Americanized
The food gets bland and loses it authenticity (ie
Olive Garden)
This is not true with Cara Mia
You can even order in Italian, which I love
Cara Mia is definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in the city and if you havent been there yet, its a must try
Entrees range from $15-30 and the portions are huge
Our waiter vanished, so we asked another if they had a dessert menu
Yes
Perhaps he thought we were just taking a poll, not that we wanted to see it! When our waiter reappeared, we asked him for the dessert menu
Never brought us the dessert menu, just the check
Guess he decided we shouldn't have dessert!
I lived and learned to cook in Italy
I was there for 6 years and can say with some authority (my Italian husband agrees) this place does it right! The best way to judge an Italian restaurant is by its pasta al pomodoro, it was great - just as good as my own (if not better)
My husband had the ravioli of some sort and was very pleased to have finally found an Italian place worth actually paying money for
The atmosphere of this place is adorable! So quaint, charming, and welcoming
The food was delicious
best shrimp scampi I've ever eaten
Absolutely darling
One of the greatest italian restaurnats I have been to in the city
The entres are seasoned to perfection, the wine is top notch and the prices will not break your bank
An absolute must, do try!
Cara Mia is an amazing NYC experience not to be overlooked! On top of the excellent food, service, and unbeatable prices, my entire party was treated just like family
when the check was finally given, it brought tears to my eyes; I wanted to stay forever
I will go back to NYC very soon just to be reunited with my Italian family at CARA MIA!!!
cute little room, nice on good day with doors open very interesting menu, roasted calamari different and good service could use a little more coordination, polish otherwise marks would have been much higher
better than most of the names in the theather district
imho
This place is a bit of a dive - but the food is good and the prices are great!  The pad thai and summer rolls are the best I've had
The west side has a few Thai restaurants that are near hole-in-the-wall status but few as impressive as this place when considering the service, price, and food
Walked in here and tried their prefixed menu in which you could choose a soup/salad, appetizer, entree, and dessert for a little over $12
While thats a great deal, ordering off the menu without regard to the deal will get one better portions and even at that rate its still rather inexpensive
Service is great and the decor is not bad, a tad overdone with the Thai posters and cheesy never-ending TV commercials / music videos
This would be a fantastic neighborhood hangout and their massaman and Thai iced tea is fantastic
I love this place!! the food is great and cheap? I am a regular customer since they only have like 10 tables
Now that they're expanding, it looks even better and more variety of menu to try!!
The Yum Yum Bangkok is a catchy name that brought us there
We thought the food would be yummy as the name but very disappointing
The food was not that fresh as it was supposed to be
I even could not finish my food
Disappointed Thai food
I just read that last negative review
I don't know what happened to that person but I've been going to all of the Yum Yum restaurants for years and I unreservedly recommedn them as some of the BEST cuisine -- not just Thai cuisine, but ANY cuisine -- of any kind in the city
It's inexpensive, the service is gracious and friendly, and the food is almost always delicious
Furthermore the menu is a bit different from the standard Thai fare -- exotic, tasty, and appetizing
The only reservation one could possibly have is that the restaurants are frequently so busy that there is sometimes a wait -- but this is for reasons that ought to be patently obvious to anyone who knows New York
If it's busy
We went to have Thai food at yum yum bangkok last night
We were so disappointed about everything from the poor service to the worst cool Pad Thai noodle dish
We were asked about the gratuity after the poor service
The waitress was always forgot our drink orders
T
I've tried most of the Thai restaurants in the city and Yum Yum Bangkok is by far my favorite
It offers great food at reasonable prices
The waiters are very friendly and the service is quick and efficient
The decor has improved tremendously with the expansion of the restaurant
The food is consistently good: The chicken with basil is delicious and the all the appetizers are yummy
I recommend the chicken puffs and the coconut chicken soup
It's a great place for romantic dinner or for group dinners
They'll even put tables together to accomodate big groups
Im really picky about food
I cant eat a few stuff but at this place they cook everything order by order so they would let me oder my food just the way i like it ! The restaurant always busy but the food was fast and great ! Love it !
Honestly, I am a pad-Thai freak, I have eaten it everywhere
This is some of the best
The flavor is incredible! I worked in the neighborhood for 3 years and ordered it once per week - the other food does not dissapoint either
Lightning fast service
I usually order in from this place, and I have to say that they are really very quick at delivering food
If I had to eat out, I would not frequent this place as much mainly because of the inconsistency in taste
For example, I ordered in once and the food was awesome and perfectly prepared
Another time, it was bland even though I had asked for it to be spicy, and it wasn't as tasty
The soup here is just okay
But spicy fried rice is delicious! So I would say overall good for a take-out/delivery in my area

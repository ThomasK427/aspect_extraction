I have been to this place once and had delivered maybe 4 times
Every time the crust and toppings have been excellent
BTW, there is a lot of good pizza in California
I love NY but you need to get over the pizza thing
best clam pizza around
very light and tasty
not too bulky
settles well in your stomach
a bit overpriced tghough for a pie of even just the plain pizza
As for the previous reviewer, the crust wasn't burnt, it was charred
the sign of a good coal or wood oven crust
I'm not even from new york and i know a good crust
As for Manhattan not having good pizza, you just suggested a joint on Broadway, which if I'm not mistaken IS IN MANHATTAN
Lombardi's has a great crust char with some chewiness, very mild but fresh sauce, and mild mots
Fresh basil and garlic are plentiful and the mushrooms were squeeky fresh
The ambiance on the back patio leaves everything to be disired but this place is about pizza, hot and fast
Still no Grimaldi's in my opinion though
Tried many pizzas throughout the world
Manhattan just doesn't have good pizza
Brooklyn is better
Chicago and L
A
are better
Lombardi's is just another tasteless pizza
The sauce tastes like tomato sauce out of a can Why bother
Go to Mamma Sbarro's on Broadway if you want a decent pizza
the clam pizza is a must try
lots of clams on a thin brick oven crust
beautiful in flavor and in presentation
I never knew pizza could taste like this
Great service, fresh ingredients
Overall a good value
Not being a fan of pizza, I reluctantly joined my friends at this restaurant which was highly reccomended in the guide we were using
The service was very good, and the waitresses were polite and smiley
The restaurant is in a U shape but seemed a little cramped
The food was, well, large, actually the largest pizza I have ever seen, and it tasted pretty good
They will even put different toppings on each part of the pizza to suit everyones taste!
GRIMALDI'S HOLDS UP BETTER CARRIED OUT OR DELIVERED
BOTH ARE HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE ALL COMPETITION
The Pizza here is Phenomenal! It is just as good if not better than John's Pizza (DOn't get me wrong, John's is great too
You can really tell the difference that a coal burning Brick oven and the best ingredients make! I really consider myself spoiled to live in a town that has food like this
NY is known for having the best Pizza in the world
If you want great Pizza definitely check out Lombardis - it is that good, you will not be dissappopinted
What this place lacks in ambiance, it more than makes up with the amazing pizza
I think the clam pizza (my special favorite) is absolutely wonderful (not to mention unusual)
But all of the toppings are great and fresh and beautifully prepared
I always enjoy the side salad too
A winner in Soho, for sure!
The pizza in this establishment is just superb
Mere words cannot describe an encounter with Lombardi's famed Clam Pizza
It is totally divine
This place is proof that the best pizza in the world comes from NYC!
Absolutely the best pizza experience for 60+ years of family pizza eating
Keep it simple
medium with pancetta, fresh garlic, meatballs
After 6+ visits from Alabama, absolutely the BEST! Never miss it!
The pizza was delicious and authentic
There was real mozarrella on the pizza
The atmosphere was quaint and romatic
I had a great experience
Loved it, small quanit place, real NY atmosphere, pizza tasted fresh, had fresh basil etc
on the pie, just a nice NY pizza joint
For the BEST pizza in New York City you have to go to Lombardi's
The pie is out of this world, there is only one word to discribe it
PERFECT
located near the corner of Spring and Mulberry streets the price is great, and it is definatly a place to take a date
Don't be put off from the outside appearance cause it looks like a little hole in the wall but it isnt on the inside
Lombardi's clam pie's still the best in the city
However, the best plain pie is Totonno's in Coney Island
Sure, their hours are irregular, there's zero atmo, and the staff is surly as hell
But the moment you sink your fangs into that chewy-thin, extra virgin drizzled brick oven crust, and inhale the heavenly garlicky marinara and gooey, mozzerella you could stretch clear across the Brooklyn Bridge, you forget all the b
s
you had to put up with
And folks - John's Pizza??!! No offense, but those pies cannot hold a candle to the three brick oven heavies: Lombardi's, Totonno's, and Grimaldi's (which, by the way, has been using sub-par mozarella of late, so steer clear of those punishing lines and head to Lombardi's or Totonno's)
Absolutely fabulous pizza
Also, try the baked clamms
They use pancetta and melted mozzerella
Very interesting and delicious
Lombardi's is fabulous! I ate there a few months ago and was blown away
I have never had pizza with so much flavor
I believe it is all in the sauce
This restaurant is a must!
Lombardi's is a lovely family oriented pizzeria
The service was fast and courtesy and the pizza was great
It was not the usual generic pizza you get all over NYC, it was a treat - you tasted the tomatoes, the herbs and spices
it was a delight! The neighborhood can't be beat, Little Italy
A great way to spend a Saturday night with your children, eat pizza and then walk around Little Italy and Chinatown
Ask to be seated upstairs on the deck and you'll have no problem
Simply put, the best pie in New York
the place is great but a bit small and generally crowded
Worth the wait however
The service was excellent and the Pizza was phenominal
We were there yesterday for lunch
Seating was immediate
The server was the best I've had in awhile
We were able to sit afterwards and enjoy a second beer
Great pizza
friendly service
it's all you need! And it LOOKS great when it's served!
Good pizza all the time

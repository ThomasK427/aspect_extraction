It took several tries to get the waiter's attention for us to even get water
After the waiter finally took our order and gave us our food he never came back
We practically had to beg to get our check so we could end the nightmare
When that finally came, there were items that we ordered but never received
We didn't even care that we didn't get all we ordered
We just wanted to get out
The owner was also there and he was very unpleasant to us
I've been there a few times with my fiance and every time I come out pleased
It is a very nice cozy place with great food
The service is prompt and always with a smile
The price is reasonable for the portions that are served
I highly recommended it, and trust me when I say this place will leave you with the an Egyptian enchantment coming back for more
Their wood oven pizza is out of this world! We happened upon this restaurant while walking around one evening and have been thankful eversince
Terrific selections and wonderful food; a wonderful find
Sometimes very crowded, but if you get there early, the wait is never too long
my friend had recommended the place for their ice cream concoctions so i was eager to try it out
i was a little disappointed to see that there wasnt much on their menu besides the normal stuff like sundaes sodas
the place definitely has an old-fashioned soda shop vibe to it, with old childrens magazines books on the shelves, as well as jars filled with penny candy
i had the coffee mocha ice cream soda ($3
75) which was basically like a chocolate egg cream with a scoop of coffee ice cream topped with whipped cream a cherry
the ice cream wasnt very good as it had shards of ice in it, but the overall drink was ok
the place is pretty new and the waiter had no idea how to make our drinks (the manager had to teach him), but he was friendly and apologetic
love this place! great food and warm service in this charming intimate gem on an otherwise still industrial street
if the candy shop in the back doesn't convince you the omelettes and the sandwiches will
This is worst dining experience I've ever had in NYC
This place belongs in a foodcourt of a suburban shopping mall
It's like a low-budget Disney experience gone very wrong
The prices are outrageous and the food is similar to mid-budget sushi that you left in your refrigerator for a few days
Not even tourists should try this - it's not what eating in NYC is about
I love this place- only for its atmosphere
It's fun, and the magicians are so funny
Don't expect to be blown away by the food
I've been to this restaurant a couple of times already, and each time I ordered from a different prix-fix tasting menu, but nothing tastes good
I've even tried their sushi and sashimi and still wasn't impressed
Food is mediocre to below mediocre
BUT I will go back- solely for its atmosphere
The food was good although the a la carte selection, particulary the sushi, was somewhat limited
We all ordered different things and the best was probably the vegetarian tasting menu
I've had better sushi elsewhere for less money, but you go to Ninja for the ambience and funky presentation - not for an outstanding meal
There is an excellent selection of sake and desserts though
The crowd is not great either - I went on a Saturday night and it was packed with tourists and BT
In short - fun to visit, good for groups, but I will not be back on my own buck
Ninja is one of the bestest best restaurant in New York city
Atmosphere is amazing, very delicious food, great service, very friendly, attentive
Presentation is unique, crazy! We loved everything about ninja
It was eight of us in the party, ate, drunk, had a really great time
We had our private room also
We tried the Hanzou junmai daiginjo sake which is only at ninja, exclusive to ninja and the tasting course
Tamate bakko is Not my cup of tea but everything else was awesome
The comments I red about ninja saying is expensive, waste of money etc
, my comment to that is you are only cheap to yourself and if you dont have the money you know where the McDonald is!  Great time, food, service
We loved it, everybody enjoyed it
We have a new favourite spot!
I took my girlfriend here on a Saturday night for her birthday and we both enjoyed it immensely
From the pork cooked in a squid ink sauce to the soup cooked with an 800 degree rock to real fresh wasabi root ground up in front of you on a sharkskin paddle (not the Japanese horseradish just about every other Asian restaurant serves), we enjoyed every mouthful
From the moment you step on the elevator to go down to the village until the moment you once again are back on the city streets you will have a great time and be treated to some wonderful food
While I am not a sake lover myself, a co-worker of mine who lives on the Japanese rice liquor went tried out the sake tasting menu
He was blown away by the quality and ended up buying a bottle for himself
Don't listen to the snobby reviews that seem to show up about this place
Just look at the majority and you'll see that this is a fun place to go
You'll forget that you're in the busiest city in America for the two or more hours that you're eating and you'll enjoy everything that's put in front of you
Ask your server about the food too
From what we found they were able to answer just about every questing we had
They could talk about the background of each dish, the ingredients used in them, how things were prepared, and what influences were used in each
It's expensive, came out to be $200 for the both of us after tax, but well worth it for someone looking for a night out that's different than your run of the mill Japanese joint
Be sure to ask about the drinks that are not on the menu
Ever have a lychee martini? No? Well order one here and enjoy yourself as you watch the ninjas run past your private table and eat some wonderful food
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! Excellent sushi, fresh wasabi and not to mention the steak with the Garlic sauce
My friends loved everything we ordered, and the presentation is amazing
Sake, food, place, service A+ Highly recommended! Was worth it! awesome
This is the best find in the city
The service and atmosphere are superb
Delicious food and excellent entertainment
Worth the trip

So like everyone thinks I am Justin Guarini and the waitstaff at Ninja was no exception
I walked in without a reservation (having a good hair night
check), sang a few bars, and was immediately wisked down the elevator by the hostess (Hello Moto, Justin is here, over
)  Once downstairs, I was lead through a maze of dark caves as I opted to take the dangerous path
I was attacked by a ninja on the draw bridge, but luckily he didn't touch my hair
Little did that little ninja know, I was packing, if you know what I mean
I whipped out my num-chucks and showed that slithery black-clad karate kid that 3-months training was no feat for my registered fists of fired fury
Anywho, enough about me
onto the food
It's a secret and I loved it
Me and my boyfriend were walking around
We saw ninja accidentaly, we went in
I think this one was one of the best restaurant experience
I never thought sushi could be so good until i tried it at ninja
Very well presented, clean and fresh
We ordered from ala carte, tried different dish
I must say, we really liked the CONCH BOMBSHELL
Every dish we ordered was delicious
The staff, atmoshpehe is amazing, very attentive
We were very pleased and happy
We will be back
Highly recommended!
And that's all it is
Great service, good sake selection, and a humorous environment (a good amount of space too)
The food though, is almost inedible

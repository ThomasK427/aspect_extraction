The food was cold, I think everything was pre-made and just scooped on to our cold plates and there it was
The meatloaf was cold, we had to ask the waiter to re-heat it and my monkfish tasted very much frozen
The best thing on my plate was the mashed potatoes-it was hot!!  If you want to eat fast, cafeteria style that's the place to be; if you actually want a tasty, hot meal, take your $14
50 across the street
Overall, not a good value
The most impressive item at Dish was the menu, listing a plethora of dizzingly described side dishes to order as a picnic style plate (3 for $12) or along side the Big entre dishes
The creamy tomato soup was incredible
The corn pudding had a nice taste but was lukewarm
The roasted green beans were cold and did not taste roasted or garlicky
The beets with horseradish were shredded and reminiscent of the stuff you get at Gus' Pickles on Essex Street
I give the highest rating to the smoked trout appetizer served with a roasted lemon half and pickled fennel
Aside from the appetizer, presentation was lacking - the food looked as if it were slapped onto the plate
The concept is fun, but the food is better at Mama's Food Shop (where they supply you with a microwave to heat as you please)
Some dishes were tasty, but overall the food was disappointing
Couple items we got did not seem fully cooked
Bacon on sandwich was slab of white fat
Green beans were cold and gray
It seems many of the vegetables are served cold - but they don't mention this when you order (for us it seemed like everything was cold
) Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff (although, service was slow)
Prices are good - so might give it a second shot
Dish is an inexpensive restaurant ($12 per entree + 2 sides) with unique food
The atmosphere is decent with very friendly staff and owner
The only con is the small number of entrees -- however, the large variety of sides more than makes up for it
In addition, there is an upstairs space for parties and cooking classes
Definitely worth checking out
In Short The hallway entrance doubles as a wine cellar with nearly 600 backlit bottles of French wine
Through the sliding door is a cozy dining room full of small tables set off by huge antique mirrors and fetish-y erotic artwork
The cuisine is traditional French with dishes like filet mignon au poivre, salmon with bearnaise, and foie gras en terrine
Every night features music, either by a jazzy soul band or a disco DJ

fabulous and discreet
i'd like to keep the secret
need i say more?
The Scene A three-story palace of wood paneling, oversized utensils and plush furniture, Savannah Steak is a prime choice for low-key private parties and business gatherings
The decor falls somewhere in between the flavorful history of a classic steakhouse and the confident gloss of more modern ones
The Food Savannah's steaks are tasty, and roundly satisfy the urge for meat, but they fall short of what they could be
The porterhouse is just a bit on the tough side; the filet mignon is butter-soft but lacks flavor; and the prime rib is missing that essential savor that makes it worth the investment
Other offerings, though--a delicate, sweet pork chop, buttery seared tuna, lemongrass-steamed mussels--are basic but do all you could ask of them, and the restaurant's seafood selection in particular shows excellent attention to detail
Went for dinner on my own, great steak, great service
Nice wine list with some good music, a must for those visiting New York
Super
My co-workers and I often go out to steakhouses in the midtown/rock center area for after work drinks and to take out clients
Savannah hosted our last company party and the food, ambiance and service were truely top-notch
The steaks were prepared perfectly and they also had a huge selection of non-steak entrees which seemed to satisfy every last one of our guests! From their impressive wine list to their tapas menu, for my money Savannah stands out from it's peers! Bravo!
I've been using seamless to order my dinners at the office for some time
I never tried Savanah Steak so I thought I'd give it a try
For $35, the amount my firm allocates for dinner, I was able to purchase a Kobe Burger and a Goat Cheese salad
45 minutes later, my food arrives in terrible condition
The goat cheese salad ($11) was ~20 leaves of mesculin, half a sliced tomato, and a spoonful of warm goat cheese
Tasted terrible - I ate half
The Kobe Burger was tasteless - best part was the onion - and the bottom bun was clearly cut improperly so I had to hold half the burger with my fingers just to eat it
Anyone with half a right mind can cut a burger bun, but not Savanah Steak
The place is nice, food is good, but the bar could use some lighting, you can't even see what they have back there
Overall my experience was great, I will be back
I dined here for lunch with a few financier colleagues for Price Fixe Friday
A better name of Savannah Steaks would be Savannah Soup Kitchen
The bleu cheese wedge was terrible
When I realized how awful the dressing was I reached for the bread
But to my dismay we werent a bread worthy table and werent served any
I probably would have prefered a kick in the junk to the BLT sandwich I had for my main course
The waiter was prententious or maybe just disgruntled that he accepted the job at Savannah over the fry boy position at Carls Jr that he was also qualified for
However, there was one sparkle in the dust cloud that is Savannahs
The hostess was both attractive and friendly
They didnt have candy at the door, but she substituted well as eye candy
All in all, we got hosed
Not since the movie Cocktail has there been such a lively, energetic bar scene
I have been to Savannah many times but with the addition of Mix master Mitch behind the bar, the mood has changed
This place is on fire
Great crowd (Disco Dom of NJ streetfighter fame) , attractive corporate women everywhere
This will supplant Sushi Samba as a after work scoping scene
Unfortunately, Mix Master Mitchy P only works Wednesday so get there early cause to catch that pearly smile, you need a good spot at the bar
We just got back from dinner at Savannah and I must say it was not a good experience
The steak was terrible
very overpriced for the quality of food
The worst part
my dad brother followed our waiters recommendation for tonight's special- the kobe steak
When we got the bill, we were very surprised to find out that they charged $90 for each steak!!! What a rip off!! The other steaks on the menu were $30-$40, so the waiter really should have told them the price of the special
The waiter could care less that we were unsatisfied
Do yourself a favor and go to Peter Luger or Sparks for the same price and totally different league!
I thought the food and service at Savannah was great
I had the Tuna (sesame encrusted and with a wonderful soy and wasabi sauce) and it was fabulous
I highly recommend this restaurant
Everyone in my 10 person party enjoyed it
Although this midtown steakhouse had a lot of potential as a result of its' proximity to my office, I was disapointed by their inferior food and poor service
My clients actually commented about the rude and unprofessional behavior of the waiter and manager
How embarrasing
I will never again make a dinner reservation at Savannah
The service in this place is absolutely horrible! The prices are outrageous for poor quality food-possibly the worst steak I have had
Not to mention the lobster bisque - or shall I say lobster broth! Have you ever been served your oysters and have to ask for plates? Not getting a butter knives for the bread? How about your porterhouse arriving sizzling and continuing to cook - especially when you asked for the it rare? To top it off once again you have to ask for plates? Is this a caveman place to eat? For this service I could have gone to Friday's! I should have known - the place was completely empty on a Friday night!
Went with my cousin for FoxNews departmental Christmas social - Dec '03 and we decided to order food
Our waiter was pretty cool, my meat was nicely well done, the way it should be eaten! My cousin enjoyed her meal as well
The crowd was trendy without over doing it
Will dine again with others in the near future
Although the food wasn't horrible, I definitely do not think it was worth the cost
I've been to many steakhouses in NYC and thought I'd try this one
The foods was just average (and the macaroni cheese souffle was a disappointment), and certainly wasn't worth the money
There are certainly better places to get a good steak in NYC
Good Looking place with good looking people and Good food
What else can I say but try it, you will like it
We just tried out Savannah the other night on a recommendation from a friend

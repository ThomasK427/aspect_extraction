This is a great chilean/peruvian restaurant
It is small, but not too small, (I went with a group of 12) and it is cozy and romantic
The food is excellent genuine chilean/peruvian cuisine, (I'm chilean, I should know), and the service is excellent
Some items on the menu can be a little pricy but nothing that will put a permanent hole in your pocket
Some nights they have live entertainment from chilean singers
If your not familiar with chile and want to get a little ethnic, this is a perfect place to visit, especially when there is live entertainment
The only bad thing about this place is that you have to park on the street, which can be a pain in the rear
Don't Forget to try the Pisco Sour
Happy Eating
the best salad you ever eat great value far as the food goes you cant get better value for your money
I had the highest hopes for this restaurant as the ambiance and view are spectacular
My husband and I were not impressed
The water could not describe the entrees (I asked what scallop agnolitti was and if it was a form of pasta - after hearing a very long-winded explanation I still had no idea that I would be served ravioli)
My yellowtail ceviche was not yellowtail at all and I had to send it back
Evertyhing was saturated in oil
My husband eats just about anything and his plate was still 3/4 full when we left
Thank goodness for the bread service
I was considering this place for a private event and I am very thankful I ate there first to help me exclude it as an option
Sorry, but my advice is to go here only for drinks and the bread
if you are going here, you know that you are going for the view, the ambiance, not the food, so guess the food being above average is a great bonus
NICE PLACE, NICE ATMOSPHERE, BAD FOOD
I HAD NEVER SEEN A RED SNAPPER TURNED INTO FISH FILET SQUARES
WOULD HAVE TOLERATED IT IF IT HAD TASTED DECENTLY BUT IT DIDN'T
WAY OVER PRICED , HAD MUCH BETTER MEALS FOR JUST OVER HALF THE PRICE IN PLACES JUST AS NICE
Authentic Spanish (from Spain) cuisine and impeccable service
Very classy and well managed
Dropped in by accident off the highway on a Sunday morning and will go out of our way to drop in any chance we get
The offerings beyond the Bagels were outstanding, the Paninis were like we found in Italy itself
We live in Maryland but visit the area often and will always make a stop at Bagel Buffett
i live in north bergen, and i actually find myself driving to secaucus just to goto Bagel Buffet
I love it when I get a nice everything bagel, toasted, with cream cheese
Yum-o! Best bagels in the area, and in Secaucus no less!
I did not rate food, ambiance or value because *we never got seated*! I called ahead and was told that there would be no problem seating a party of two at 5:30, arrived at 5:30, was told there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait
Fine, reasonable, figured it would probably be longer, waited for over half an hour when a couple that came in 20 minutes after us was called to be seated
I approached the desk to see if there was some mistake, and, even though my name was clearly down on the list, I was told that I would just have to wait for the *next* table
Their attitude was as if they were so busy they did not need my business, so we left
Very unprofessional and rude
I have gone there a number of times and have not had a bad meal yet
The Best option if you don't feel like leaving the building
The B
L
T
's are perfect , you have a choice of breads and toppings and will be made in two minutes
Just across the street from Branch Brook Park and the 280
VERY COURTEOUS STAFF
YOU CAN RELAX AND TAKE YOUR TIME
GREAT FOR 2 OR 20
WE GO THERE EVERY 6 WEEKS OR SO, BUT TRY TO STAY AWAY ON FRI/SAT EVES @ DINNERTIME
LATER IS BETTER
AFTER 10PM
ON THOSE DAYS
WE ALWAYS GO HOME WITH FOOD FOR ANOTHER DAY OR MORE
BEST RED SANGRIA
Crowded, loud, mass produced Portugese food and way to busy for the service to be attentive or caring
A word of good advice
Don't use the Restaurant valet parking or let the attendants near your car
Sticky Fingers
There is a sign there for good reason and it expalins everything !   My reccomendation
go to any of the other great Portgese restaurants further down Ferry street
Hope this helps and saves you from a horrible experience
D
In one word, EXCELLANT
, the food is so good you can't deside on what to have
Best seafood in town
This restaurant truly athenticates the Spanish food I remember from my year living in Seville, Spain
This local favorite in the Iron Bound District of Newark create tapas and paellas like they are supposed to look and taste
and that's what I'd stick to on the menu, appetizers and paella
From Serrano Ham to Manchego Cheese to the Fried Sweet Peppers, this place rules!
I cant beleive that Chucke Cheeses got a better rating than Francesca! Francesca does not only have pizza it has a wonderful italian cuisine menu
I love the vodka sauce and the homemade garlic bread makes it all worth while
If spicy is what you like, try the fra diavolo sauce, its outstanding
And the prices are more than fair if you want a quality meal for a lesser price
I give it a -10
The minus is for the occasional parking unavalibity
My husband and I were not pleased with any aspect of our meal
We were one of four parties in the place
It was extremely cold in the restaurant the day we went - uncomfortably cold after 5 minutes
The waiter seemed to scoff that we ordered a cup of hot tea in order to warm up
We both requested only water to drink
We only ordered entrees and they did not arrive for 40 minutes after placing the order
The food was not impressive
Half way through the meal we did not have refills on our waters, even though our waiter passed the table many times and he never stopped to check on us or to ask if we were pleased with the entrees
We did not tip our waiter, and we will never go back
There Filetmignon on the Stone is exceptional! The host Carlos Barbosa is pleasant and welcoming
They also offer a variety of wines and have a liquor store on the premises
An experience all should take part in
I recommend valenca restaurant in elizabeth to all my collegues!
I am a 36 year old average corporate worker who has enjoyed the food from Tommy's for the last 30 plus years
My parents and I had made a weekend journey to Elizabeth NJ on weekends, not a far drive for the best lunch/dinner you can get anywhere
They make their own sausage and sametimes evan a hot sausage
Not to mention the Italian hot Dog sandwich is also great
And for all off you who do not eat hot dogs because of what you may hear they are made from No Fear here these are beef hotdogs
There sandwhich is piled high with either hotdog or sausage or evan a combo with both and then oinions,peppers and perfectly fried potatoes on top and placed into fresh pizza bread roll
I hear of adding a second location in N Brunswick NJ the people living there are in for a surprise
No seating - you order and are served from a window
Try to park close by and eat in your car
This is a basic neighborhood dive bar pretending to be a restaurant
My date had to send her chicken and shrimp entree back b/c the chicken wasn't even cooked
The dining room was empty except for 2 other people who coincidentally also had to send back one of their entrees for something
The jukebox music from the bar spills into the dining room and I had the pleasure of having some drunk karaoking to every damn song

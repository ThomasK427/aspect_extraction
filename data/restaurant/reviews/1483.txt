It is to die for
Crema is the amusement park for foodies to be thrilled dish, after dish, after glorious dish
Thank you Julietta
Although there aren't are shortage of good restaurants in New York, there are few that find a special place in my heart
To be in that special category, the restaurant has to offer something I can't get anywhere else, and I have to CRAVE it
I have never had Mexican food like the food I have had at Crema's, and I've eaten at all the top places in New York
In such a short time it has become my favorite
I HIGHLY recommend the tostados with grilled scallops, the sea bass, and the chocolate cake, the latter of which has mole in it! I'm in love!
I've been several times to Crema, for both lunch and dinner
The entire experience was truly wonderful
The food was excellent and very unique, the service very friendly and attentive
The extraordinary attention to detail by chef Julieta Ballesteros and the entire staff, as well as the beautiful decor and ambience, create a rare dining experience - one where you are completely transported away from the routine of your life
AMAZING!
My friends and I agree - Julietta has done it again!! WOW - what a creative menu
Her sea bass is mouth watering and her guacamole and margaritas keep us coming back for more
Crema is a chic yet comfortable, a great place to meet friends for dinner and the perfect spot for Sunday brunch before shopping on 6th ave
Bravo!!
I went to Crema for dinner with my boyfriend and the food was unreal!! I had the rib eye steak in mole sauce with pumpkin seeds, which I highly recommend
I have never had anything quite like it
The staff is very friendly and the ambience is really great
This place just opened and it's already become my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city
The food is amazing gourmet Mexican, not another burrito joint
The cheese and chorizo appetizer is delicious and it's served with their guacamole (so you don't need to order that as well)
Not only is their dinner fantastic but they've got brunch too
I'd never had Mexican for brunch before but it's pretty good (although a lot of the stuff is the same as their other menus)
Go now before the crowds overrun it
Where to begin! I've been waiting for a restaurant like this for years! I have had a lot of guacamole in this town and Crema, hands down, is the best I have ever tasted
I could go on and on about the fabulous Flautas, delicious Chili Rellenos and the savory Ribs but I might have to jump in a cab and go there AGAIN this week
A must try friends, look for me each week because Crema is now on my standing list of once a week pitstops!
Definitely not your ordinary Mexican joint! From the moment I stepped in I felt I was in for a great evening
The decor is elegant and slick yet cheerful and inviting
The wait staff very friendly and efficient without being invasive or pushy
And the food! The food is the real star and deverses many of them
The guacamole was divinely fresh
The chicken in squash cream with portobello mushrooms and goat cheese, a feast for the senses
The cocktail list is impressive too
And creative
I recommand the Agua Loca
Fresh, frutty and deliciously strong
Thank you to the chef and her team for introducing us to the art of high quality Mexican cuisine
I attempted to call Buddha Bar numerous times to complain about our experience
I was told that the management wasn't available and to call back later in the afternoon
When I attempted to call in the afternoon, I was asked what the call was in reference to and only AFTER I explained (very nicely I might add) that I was calling in reference to a complaint, I was told that no management was available
Finally, on my fifth attempt, I was asked to leave a name and number
When I asked when I could expect a response, I was informed that management reviews the nature of the call and customers may or may not receive a response based on their discretion! I've never heard of an establishment not responding to their customers' feedback
It's been a week, and still no response
I suppose my patronage isn't welcome there, and according to other patrons' feedback, they don't think much of New Yorkers in general!
I held my husband's 35th surprise bday at Buddha Bar and it was a great night
I could not have picked a better place for it! We had 27 people in our party and the service was still excellent
All our guests loved the ambience and the food
Peter, one fo the managers kept coming up to me to make sure everything was okay, as I was the one throwing the surprise bday for my husbnad, and the service was indeed great! We had waiters on hand all night long and did not experience anything that these other negative reviewers have written
I thought the night went far better than even expected and I would definitely revisit this restaurant again
The food was amazing and the sushi was delicious
We had a prix fixe menu as we had so many guests and food was prompt and every dish amazing
The music was also a plus
A good mix for all the ages in our group and a wide variety of music so that everyone was commenting on how they liked it
I cannot find any complaints with this place and am surprised at all the negative reviews
Don't believe it, it was a fabulous evening
And I want to thank Peter again and all the waiters and Tim Gaglio for making it such a fabulous event for us
My husband enjoyed the surprise bday and was very very happy as were all our guests
I highly recommend this place for groups, bdays, or just a fun night out! the decor is truly amazing!
I live in the MPD had friends visiting from out of town
I wanted to take them to a place with spectacular decor was between BB Tao
I called BB to see if we would need a reservation for cocktails was told 'No reservation needed
No problem, just come on in enjoy'
When we got there (6 women), we were not even allowed in when a staff member with a bad attitude wearing a suit told us that we absolutely needed a reservation (yes, we've gone from an artsy community to this)! As a local, I am so tired of places that try to create faux hype! Come on! Rely on your food, your chef, your decor, your impeccable service, SOMETHING other than creating some fake VIP atmosphere to make people feel as if they need to gain admission in order to feel better about themselves
The hope is that word gets around that you just have to go because it's so hard to get in instead of you just have to go because the food, drink and service are wonderful
Since when does a great restaurant need to rely on peoples' insecurities to make $$? We went to Spice Market and had a great time
Next time, I'll recommend SM, Tao, a place with a celebrity chef who is a true artist, or anywhere but here!!!
This bar has fantastic decor but some of the worst staff I have ever encountered at a top restaurant
They were rude, didn't know their drinks and were unable to demonstrate any professionalism in their service mentality
Worse still, having gone there to celebrate the birthday of a friend, one latecomer to our group wasn't allowed in to join a group of 8 spending good money at a nice place (this doesn't apply to one doorman there later on, Blake, who was a complete gentleman)
The shortsightedness of the management appalls me and thus I say STAY AWAY
There are plenty of great restaurants in this city that know what decent service is
First of all I would like to say, i have never in my entire life experienced such a horrible dining experience
Buddha Bar is Absolutely THE WORST WORST WORST MOST HORRIBLE PLACE IN ALL OF MANHATTAN
We had reservations for dinner Wednesday night for a group of 9 people at 9:30
We arrived on time and the bouncer asked if we had a reservation, which of course we did have
Five people from my group were already at the door, we were told to wait a minute and then out of no where the bouncer said that we had a reservation for 9 people and only five of us showed up, and that they did not have a table for us because not everone was present, and we lost the table
I HAVE NEVER HEARD SUCH (BS) IN MY LIFE
We told the bouncer that the other four people were just a few minutes away because of parking issues, and are definately coming
The bouncer named Patrick told us NO MORE TABLE, we can still come in and have drinks at the bar
We asked to speak to a manger, (Tim Gaglil) we told him what happened and he did not care about anything
He was extremely obnoxious and super rude
I was extremely UPSET!!!!! We made reservations a week in advance and my guests were outraged, we came for dinner not drinks
Can you imagine, you make reservations for dinner and then told no dinner just drink and watch others enjoying themselves with a table and food
Buddha Bar OPEN YOUR EYES you have a bad reputation, New Yorkers dont appreciate to be disrespected
This establishment is very unprofessional, rude, and disrespectul towards its customers
Save your time, money, and friendship, EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE
HORRIBLE TERRIBLE PLACE!!!!!!!!!!
I am not a particularly picky person and have been to pretty much all the top restaurants in NYC
This is my WORST WORST WORST dining experience
To be fair, the place has very nice decor and food was good
But the whole place was awful
(ONE) no reservation for group over 8
We have 16, so have to split into two group sitting really far away  (TWO) we waited an HOUR and HALF to get to the table  (THREE) one friend was late and the bouncer didn't let her in and was super rude
(FOUR) We were standing next to the table talking when a manager showed up
He yelled at my friend and said if you do this again, I will throw you out
What happened was that somebody had thrown bags of sweet 'n low on the floor and that idiot manager thought we did it

I can't say enough about this restaurant and wish Marc Murphy and his team much continued success - they deserve it
More neighborhoods need solid restaurants like this one
I've been recommended this restaurant on 2 separate occasions and so I had high hopes but was bitterly disappointed when I finally made a trip myself
The place is first of all TOO CROWDED
The seats are so close together, you can't figure out who you're trying to hold a conversation with, your friend or the couple sitting next to you
The pesto mussels were good but a bit too salty
the goat cheese puffs were just too overpowering
and the waitress recommended Pasta of the Day Vongole was GROSS
sorry to be so blunt but it was like the chef had forgotten to put any sort of flavor to it we shamelessly poured the cream sauce from my monkfish dish on it
The monkfish was great
the sauce was again, a bit salty but worked well with the NO FLAVOR VONGOLE
it was disappointing overall
Landmarc has become one of my favorite habits
The bartenders and servers are brilliant, they know food, wine and their menu! The bartender remembers your favorites and makes solid recommendations and with this wine list there is no fear of being gouged
Please, please let a plentiful 1/2 bttl
menu become a NY institution
Service has always been stellar, Kathy is my favorite
I nearly always get the mussels dijonnaise
Save room for dessert, for real, there's usually something unexpected offered
For this neighborhood, on this island, this is practically bang for your buck list-worthy
I went there with a few friends and it was a solid dining experience, but nothing too memorable
The starters, wine list and desert were gerat
The entrees were fine, but nothing too special
Great service
Make sure to be seated on the second level rather than the street floor
Restuarants like this reminds me how truly fortunate I am to live in New York City
it just doesn't get any better then this
The menue has a wide selection of food so there is something for everyone's taste
I had the mussels which were plump and fresh and in an amazing sauce
I also loved the fact that they do not over price their wine
Lastly, the desserts are out of this world and they are also very unique
The waiter surprised us with the most delicious cotton candy I ever had, along with mini cones in cute little stands with home made sorbets and ice cream
It made me feel like a little kid again
This was such an amazing dinning experience that I can't wait to go back
Absolutely fabulous dining experience
Top notch wine list that is reasonably priced
the food is superb
from the mussel appetizer to the steak entree then to the dessert sampler
my friends and I had a great time and everyone was complimenting the dishes but nothing else
Not only is a great date place, it is also good for bigger groups
(of course, not the family style)
This place is fabulous
From the service, to the decor, to the food
The wine list is UNBELIEVABLE
Our waiter told us prices here are practically cheaper than in the liquor store - we paid $49 for a bottle that I've seen on other lists for $75
for real
We had mussels with pesto (fab!), shrimp salad (!!!), filet mignon (!!!!!!) - all wonderful
Service was friendly, professional and prompt
The place is relatively new so I can understand earlier posts, but it's finally gotten into its groove
Great view of the Empire State building on second floor at our table
Slick fireplace down below
Super chic without being pretentious
Now that's MY kinda place
Thank you Landmarc!
I read the previous review and I am surprised
I have only been once but the wine list at cost is fantastic and so was the cheese plate
I love the ambiance and my server was excellent
I recommend the food
There are some great tables upstairs
We had a great time and were treated with respect and received high service
I also believe the owners are local to Tribeca (learned through a conversation w/ the hostess) so I would be remiss to call it a tourist spot and would recommend to everyone to at least try it out
Just like its predecessor the independant landmarc has good intentions and trys hard - and falls short
Food is consistantly inconsistant, mostly palatable if uninspiring
From the food to the decor to the staffing, they have endevored to be non-descript The bad news is they have suceeded all to well
My suggesstion? Don't make any reservations to far into the future
Fantastic food and great space! Service was slow however and we saw our waiter only twice during the course of the entire meal
If management can impress upon the waitstaff the goal of having consistent high quality service, then this place will really shine!
A great addition to Tribeca, and as a local resident, I intend to visit Landmarc often
The food was very good, and the diverse menu adds a sense of fun to the dining experience
I have not tried the steaks yet, but everything else was good (seafood surprisingly so)
The real draw is the combination of the ambience and the wine list
Very comfortable/casual atmosphere, and a short, but very well priced wine list (I have seen some wines at double the price in other places)
Service was very food, and fitting with the place
We had been to Landmarc right after they opened, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience
We returned last week to find that the service has improved and the food remains terrific
The space is warm inviting, and the management made us feel very welcome
And the menu is strong! It is a great addition to the neighborhood, and the city
Ate dinner there for the first time and had a great experience with both the food and the service
Friendly staff and service as well as the extensive and fair priced food make this place a must try
i have to say that i have eaten in many restaurants in new york, but none as good as this one
the ambiance is warm and welcoming, the service is terrific and the food is simply flawless
i live in tribeca and am thrilled to have such a great addition to the neighborhood
I thought the food was very good and the service was just fine
For those who were there for the opening and thought otherwise, I would give it another chance
The ambience was pleasant and the waitstaff I found to be cordial and engaging
The menu was very extensive and reasonably priced, for New York City that is
The duck confit was excellent as was the lamb shank
Overall, a very good dining experience
sums up my experience last night there
Unlike other reviewers, my meal was spectacular, the service was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly, and the ambience was hip yet cozy
The duck confit fell off the bone like warm butter, the mussels were excellent and the wine selection was impressive
For those looking for a great dinner with friends, Landmarc is the new spot
This is by far my favorite regular stop in the neighborhood
I live around the corner and can't resist returning at least once a week
The atmosphere is cozy and casual
The cuisine includes great paninis, panini burgers, pizzas and some heartier entrees
The prices are reasonable, the food is great, and there is a fabulous wine by the glass selection
The staff is friendly and I have always had top service
If I have friends visiting this is where I bring them for dinner
Tables are close together so it is not great for intimate dining

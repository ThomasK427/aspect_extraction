I found myself wishing I tried the spaghetti and chicken meatballs or mushroom ravioli
Delicious tiramisu
Would go back here if in the area but don't know if I'd travel here again
It was really delicious but it didn't blow me away
50 Carmine is one of the few restaurants in NYC that serves excellent quality, real, fresh Italian food
It is not particularly well-known, considering the caliber of food and service it provides, and the high-traffic neighborhood it is located in
Antipasti are inventive and delicious, pastas always fresh and flavorful, and the wine selection is outstanding (ask your waiter for suggestions, there are many choices that are not included on the actual wine list)
The atmosphere is warm and relaxing, with just enough action to remind you that you are in the village
Plus, I have never felt rushed here, not even on a Saturday night
This is not easy to come by in an area crowded with take-out joints and tourist traps
I have come here on dates, as well as with my parents
Or go on your own and eat at the bar!
We visited 50 Carmine on Friday night and boy were we diappointed! The atmosphere was really nice and inviting but our waiter was awful! We felt like we were bothering him by wanting to have dinner
he did not help with suggestions and we either felt rushed or ignored
The food was awful!!! The spagetti with marinara was so disappointing we did not even eat it, it tasted like burnt garlic
My entree was a bit better but still not a lot of flavor
I would actually give it a second try but my boyfriend will NEVER step foot in there again!!!
Went for dinner with the girlfriend on a Friday evening, at around 7:30PM
There were about 8-9 tables open, and we were still told to wait for about 10 minutes
Our waiter had read us the specials, and we had ordered the Fried Artichoke to start, and she had the Bucatini, and I had the Tagliatelle
The dishes were average, nothing special
I was disappointed to hear another waiter (or it could've been the owner) was reading completely different specials (most of which I would've wanted to try if I didn't overhear at the end of our meal) to the table next to us
I wouldn't suggest anyone to go out of their way to eat here, only if you were in the area with no other dining options
I visited 50 Carmine on a special night with my bf, and fell in love with their seared squid appetizer and wild boar parpadelle!!!! It was truly a heavenly dining experience, and just when you think it just can't get any better
BOOM! the panna cotta with the pomegranate sauce
my boyfriend who never eats dessert could not keep his spoon out of it! We ended up scraping and fighting for another taste of the creamy vanilla scoop with a pinch of sour pomegranate flavor!! It was great
and I am still dreaming about the squid and the parpadelle
Everything about this restaruant is impeccable
The wait staff from top to bottom never leave you wanting for anything
The food is incredible
I was even made a dish that was not on the menu
I highly reccommend
We had a wonderfull dinner at 50 Carmine during a recent visit to NYC
To our paletes, the restaurant lived up to the hype
Service was excellent and very accomidating- no problem when we called to let them know we would be late
Our children were with us and the staff was more than willing to prepare a simple pasta-butter-parmesan dish for our 8yr old
The other 3 of us swapped plates of Pappardele with Duck Ragu- Many Cheese Pasta- Gnochi with Browned Sage Sauce
Our 12yr old refused to relinquesh the Pappardele dish
I had a bit and understood why- it was outstanding
Given the quality of the food, presenation and level of service, I think a more formal environment would have been more appropriate
As it is, the restaurant is casual, with a neighborhood feel to it
Outstanding and highly recommended !
Went with a good friend after all the hype just to see for myself
I've heard both good and bad from friends and co-workers, but with the tremendous amount of hype this little place has gotten it's hard to get an accurate opinion from anyone
We ate at the bar to avoid waiting for a table
Wine list is shorter than I'd hoped and nothign really stands out
Prices are fair
Spinach salad was good
Gnocchi with pancetta, fava beans and pea shoots was absolutley incredible
Steak was good, but nothing special at $30
Duck was also nice
Panna cotta, which I expected to be just about as standard as panna cotta, was amazing
Fluffy texture and tart with plumped apricot
The room is nothing special
It actually feels very lacking after a few minutes dining
Basically, a great spot for pasta that doesn't cost what its worth
I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the wine which was recommended by my server Marco was spectacular
It was an incredible experience and made a great first date impresion on my now girlfriend
I recommend you make reservations today
It is worth the ride from anywhere in the city
The food here is unremarkable
The pastas are bland and oily
I left this restaurant hungry
Save yourself and go to Marinella across the street
It's hard to believe that any credible diner would think this place is anything remarkable
Pastas are average and pretty much flavorless (the wild boar pappardelle is stringy and overcooked); hosts are downright rude; and the service, spotty at best
Contrary to what this reviewer says, the duck was actually tenderly cooked -- but disappointingly flavorless
Save your money (and get bigger portions) by heading somewhere else for more satisfying pasta
And DON'T overly tip the RUDE service!!
Despite having a reservation and a half-empty restaurant, the host tried to seat my wife and I at the worst table in the place
Bad start
Our food was remarkably flavorless
However, that's still better than the table next to us, which returned lasagne because it was burned (how do you burn lasagne?) and the couple on our other side, whose food never arrived (and they were seated before us)
There's 3 or 4 better restaurants on the same block - go to one of them instead
Went to 50 Carmine last night with a group of 5 and we couldn't have made a better choice
Thought we were going to have a winner from the pleasant person on the other side of the phone when I called for our reservation
After some killer martinis at the very sociable bar, we had a fabulous dinner, which we will all remember for quite a while
Our antipasti course included tender and perfectly seasoned grilled calamari and crostini with salami and anchovies
Then came the first course where we all chose different half orders of pasta in order to get the most tastes
Dont miss the red wine infused pasta
Our entrees included a slow cooked lamb dish and some magic short ribs (perfect choices for a cold rainy night)
No pretensions here just great food served by a wonderful staff
I took my friend there for her birthday the weekend after Thanksgiving and I was so excited to dig into dreamy pasta
Every dish we had was awful
Maybe the star chef wasn;t cooking because I know she has a very good reputation but something was wrong that evening
I would never go back
I was happily surprised to find this charming italian restaurant so close to the heart of the city and yet inside you are transported away from the hustle and bustle of it all
The wait staff were extremely knowledgable and friendly and the food was delicious
A great place to stay and catch up with friends in a quiet atmosphere
My friends and I were so impressed with its variety quality of ingredients
The chestnut ravioli are out of this world
I had the short ribs, which practically slid off the bone, over polenta
AMAZING
We also had the lamb stew which had chanterelles instead of artichokes, the lovely waitress informed us
Succulent
The duck breast w/fennel farro was so juicy, my buddy was all smiles
The gentleman who sat us and suggested our wine couldn't be more pleasant
The lasagne was killer
There were so many exciting dishes on the menu
We couldn't even try everything we wanted! Our bellies aren't big enough! So happy they're on the block

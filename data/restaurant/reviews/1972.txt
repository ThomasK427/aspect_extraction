Go there hungry and order the food spicy, if you can handle it
Start off or round up with a drink at Double Happiness which is just around the corner
Most delicious nan and curry chicken appetizer
The food is delicious and inexpensive
If you're looking for an alternative from all of the Italian restaurants in the area, Nyonya is the place
The menu has a variety of dishes such as Singapore stir fried rice noodles, chicken curry, pad thai etc
The food is definitely worth the wait to get a table, but the service may make you think twice before returning
I think this sums it up: two appetizers and two entrees for $27
And the portions are not small
Oh
and by the way, the food is really, really tasty
Great, flavorful dishes
big menu
Had the Roti Canai, Baby Oyster Omelette (awesome!), Chow Kueh Teow, and Beef Rendang
Recommend all! I can't stress enough how much of a great value this restaurant is
If it wasn't for the dead fish floating in the aquarium, the meal would have been perfect
So inexpensive, yet so good! My sister and I both had appetizer (the roti, of course) and a meal and the damage was no damage at all - just $18
I strongly recommend the beef chow fun and the mango chicken
This is a secret place for ethnic food-lovers, the best Malaysian in NYC without exception
What makes it the best is the large menu (larger than Penang for instance) and the consistent thrill each dish with its complex flavors, provides
Shortcomings include rushed service occasionally (the optimist in me calls it efficient) and drafts
You know that when a restaurant is packed with an international cusine has local communities frequenting there, that the place ought to be good and reliable and authentic! This Penang family restaurant has a larger menu selection, equally good food, if not better and the prices are half those of Penang
If you can make your way to this hideout in CHina Town, and wait in line for a table, it won't be dissapointing in the least! Remember to request your shrimp to be de-shelled and de-headeded! that was the gross part of the meal!
This place is always crowded, which is a sign that it is always good
Start off your meal with Roti Canai and try the Clay Pot Pearl Noodles
I have been to this restaurant too many times, its useless to count
EVERY person that I have introduced this place too, has come back not once, but several times! Its truly a fantastic place
As close to a Malaysian food restaurant in Malaysia! Forget the restrooms (though I think its not bad!, heck they have those Cruch Ad's on how to use the toe to flush!)
Super cheap for large groups
A 6 course meal for 8 will cost you just about $150
Thats a dinner for 2 in normal Manhattan! LOVE IT!
Dining there many times and the food are always spicy and delicious
Service is super fast
Yes, the restroom is ugly, and dcor is minimum, but so what? People are here for the fantastic food
BTW, they only accept cash, and the bill wont cost you an arm and a leg
If youre in Brooklyn, check out the one on 8th Ave as well
Took my sister and her friend here during a trip to the city
We were seated in the corner section in the atrium which was great since it was a sunny day
Our waiter was very friendly and attentive always topping off our drinks or asking us if we needed anything
There was a particular dish they didn't have but the kitchen made it for me anyway without hesitation which was great since it was my first time there and I was treated like a regular
We all enjoyed the bruschetta very much as well as our meals
I've read certain reviews on this restaraunt and I'm surprised to hear the exact opposite of our experience
This is the third place I've been to for dinner in Little Italy and I've always been treated very well by the staff
I would recommend this restaraunt to anyone for lunch or dinner
My first two visits to Il Palazzo were fantastic
The food was so good that everyone at the table wished they weren't full, so that they could eat more of the generous portions
We had Italian friends in town for the marathon and went there last night for some yummy carbs
This time, the food was incredibly disappointing
I ordered the same dish that I had there the week before, and what a difference
The pasta was overdone and the sauce thin
The reaction of my Italian friends? A shrug and a polite it's average
I won't be returning anytime soon
had a fettucini with a cream sauce, prosciutto, porcini mushrooms
it was excellent
had the house cabernet which was good but not great
they also put it in a small wine glass, so I couldn't swirl it and enjoy the bouquet
Top restaurants should use large size wine glasses and fill it half way
Was surprised they instead used the Olive Garden method of giving a glass of wine
Sunlit garden area made for great decor
Service was good
Pasta and wine resulted in $30 bill, which seemed standard
Would rate this a 8
9 - a definite go - but have been to even better italians in NYC
I had planned a Valentines weekend get-away for months with my girl friend
Valentines day in the city with a show and a good italian dinner
Spent a long time figuring which Italian restaurant to make reservations at
This restaurant surpassed ALL my expectations
Even the service was great
The only downfall was the EXPENSIVE specials which were NOT priced
Otherwise, this was a most enjoyable evening
one which i hope to repeat soon
GET RESERVATIONS!!
My girflriend and I were slighty hesitent because of the previous review of the service, but thought we'd check it out for ourselves - it was fantastic! Not only was the ambiance charming Italian with white table cloths, flowers and candles at every table, but the servie was impecable
Not since L'Orangerie in Beverly Hills have I enjoyed such wonderful service
Three genteman consistently were watching our table, refilling water and wine glasses every few minutes
The calamari was delicious along with the salads an pastas
We thought prices were reasonable - $5 to $13 for starters, $8 to $18 for pastas and $18 to $40 for filet, veal and fish
Best tip: Eat upstairs looking over the heart of Little Itlaly
The food is very good and the atmosphere is pleasant for a small italian restaurant
The service needs improvement
Attentive but intrusive and extremely cold and standoffish
Most reviews have this place right
Good food that needs to improve service especially at these prices
Watch out for the specials! They are recited without a price and if you don't ask boy will you be shocked
forget the desserts
Typical of most Little Italy restaurants - mostly good food and snotty service
Little Italy is hardly worth the trip
My friends and I had dinner here during the San Gennaro festival and our waiter was very friendly, accurate and speedy
The food, more importantly, was excellent
We went on a Saturday night in late August
It was a very nice dinner
My mom and her husband, (from NNJ), his sister (from SF, Ca), my twin brother and his gf, and me and my gf
The food was great, and we had a nice time, until afterwards, the waiter asks my moms husband if something was wrong with the service!!!! He left a cash tip of about 18-19% of the pre-tax bill!!! Ruined the whole experience!
The food and the ambience were good but the waiter nearly knocked me over to get to his tip!!! All evening I had noticed him immediately checking the bills to see how much his tip was (somewhat distracting
) When my fiance and I were about to get up and leave the Maitre'd jumped in front of me to get the check
The evening was good until that and it ruined the experience
Order take-out
We were a party of 4, and the other couple meeting us was running late
The Matre D let us sit at a 4-seater, but wouldn't let us order anything until the full party was there, not even bread
The food was great, and the atmosphere was fine, and it was cozy and romantic

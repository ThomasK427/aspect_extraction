One of the most delectable items at Choga is the appetizer dukboki, a spicy red pepper broth with Korean rice and fish cakes nested in julienned vegetables
The rice cakes are soft yet satisfyingly chewy in the same instant, a pleasure for the mouth both taste and mastication-wise
The flat strips of ground white fish conceptually seem unappetizing, but that could not be farther from the truth
Supple on the tongue, they have a pleasant, unobtrusive fish flavor
The spicy broth may be the best part of the entire dish; savvy diners often retain additional sauce to use on main courses much to the bemusement of the wait staff
The dukboki is a substantial portion easily sufficing for two, but hungry diners will not find it difficult to finish alone
At $8
50, its certainly a bargain considering the complexity of flavors it presents
The atmosphere of this 2nd floor restaurant was nice
The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive
The food overall was not bad, but I've had better Korean food, and for what I paid, I've gotten much more food
Didn't have the sushi, so I don't know what that is like there
But if you're looking for good korean food go to a korean bbq restaurant Korea-town (midtown 30s)
My husband and I love this place
It's an upstairs restaurant in the village, so you get a secluded feeling
The food is absolutely wonderful and fresh
Staff is friendly
One day we went in the rain, so they opened up their asian style windows and we could feel the warm wet summer air blow in and the sound of the rain was just so romantic
Reasonably priced, not crowded, food is fresh, drink is cheap
You just can't go wrong really
try the bacon dish and the bim bop thing - really good- this place is yummy
Wow! Popped in on a whim and will now be a regular! Great sushi and rolls, great Korean dishes and Woo Hoo!!! Chilled sake in a box!
this place is excellent, everything a restaurant should be
attentive service, great food (i think the korean dishes are better than the japanese ones) at a reasonable price, and i've never had a problem getting seated
if you do though just wait at the bar (yummy drinks!)
They have a variety of Korean and Japanese food, and every dish is delicious, even their small side dishes which are given for free !  They also do NYU discounts, which excludes taxes
If you're in the area, you definately check this place out
If your desperate for Bi Bim Bop in the west village and don't want to go to the 30's or get stripped at Do Wha, Choga is a pretty reasonable alternative
Moderately priced, decent variety of Korean fare (sushi too)
They don't have their act together on specials so stay away from those
No soju, but some sake selections and a friendly attentive staff
Great choice over most of the crap that lurks on Bleeker
THe ambience is great
everything is made of wood
it feels so close to the nature
food is good with good value
Choga is one of only a few good restaurants among the cluster of mediocre Italian cafes on Bleecker
The atmosphere is intimate and rustic in a funky way, the service and food excellent, and all affordable to boot
The drinks were potent and tasty (try the Wal-Mei), the sashimi was gleaming and fresh, and our waiters were disarmingly polite, attentive, and thoroughly charming
The hot sake was great, as were the Spider rolls and seafood udon (very generously sized also) and the presentation was elegant
A fantastic neighborhood place in a not-so-fab neighborhood!
In Short The line so often snakes around the block at this hip luncheonette that it seems the young, pretty patrons are merely posing outside its retro-chrome exterior
Portions are big and prices are gentle, which explains the determined crowds waiting for Latin favorites like grilled corn smothered with butter, white cheese and chili powder; chicken mole; and the classic Cubano sandwich
Another part of the allure? The name, which this SoHo spot shares with a famous Mexico City musician hangout
I came her on a friday night
Crowded, but the food was insane
(try the grilled corn) The mango magarita was the best I ever had
Fresh mango pieces! Yummy
The food here is fantastic and the price is right
It gets crowded late in the week and all day on weekends
Don't go with too big of a group
And try the breakfast!
Every time I go to this restaurant I expect a bit of a wait, good drinks while I do so, and very good food for the price
Definitely get the corn! I don't even like corn on the cob that much but I get this every time I go; it's delicious
I also really love the pork chop with goat cheese, and a mushroom au poivre sauce
It's something that's different from your average latin food
Sometimes it's so crowded that it effects the service, but it never gets to me
(although it is very hard if you are in a party of 5 or more) Most all the employees are very nice and accomodating because they're used to it being crazy
Definitely recommended!
the enchilladas were a bit too salty
i was expecting cuban food, but most of the items on this menu were mexican
there wasn't plenty that was cuban about this place
only desserts available are flan, tres de leches was not unfortunately
tried much better cuban - cafecito and havana alma de cuba!
The three of us went for dinner here on a Friday night
Waited more than 1 hour for the table
I think this place use to be a diner before it became a Cuban restaurant
Dark and not all that attractive inside
The music was also extremely loud
I ordered a grilled steak
medium well
Steak was over cooked and tasted bitter
Everything else we ordered were also average
The only thing that was good was the grilled corn
The waitress was pretty nice, but over all
I would not come back
I really like this place
The corn is do die for
If you want to avoid the long lines, and desire corn, go next door to the take out section
Overall, fun, cramped, and good food! The place is worth your time
Not worth it at all
We waited over an hour for a miniscule table, so small that I got to rub elbows with the guy next to me
The food wasn't even good, in fact, it was disgusting
The corn was burnt and flavorless
I ordered the chilaquiles
It tasted like something you buy at the frozen food section at D'Agostino's
I don't understand the hype
Although if you can get enough margaritas down, it probably wouldn't be so bad
I don't care that the staff are brisk with you, the food here is AMAZING! I recommend the veggie plate (garlic spinach), Mole Chicken and Roast Pork
Plantains are fab too, as are the corn on the cobs
Avoid it at your peril!!!
The corn is incredible, butter, cheese and roasted to delicious perfection
The cuban sandwich is crunchy with just enough ham, pork and cheese and a crunchy sour pickle to make it a great combo
Fries were well done and crispy
The drinks were absolutely great margarita was just right
The service was okay, fast seating (for two), looked like a group nearby had been there a long time
One of the waitstaff spilled a huge drink on the floor that splattered everyone nearby, no offering of apology was made or to foot the drycleaning bill and no comp was offered either
Who is managing this place? It's way too crowded, hot and loud in there
The hostess bustles you out really fast and clears the table without asking if you are done yet
Eat and get out fast

But the service was horrendous
to begin with it took us 20 minutes to order a bottle of wine even though there were only three other tables in the place
Then when we finally ordered we were told that they were going to need this table for a reservation later so we needed to hurry
The attitude that comes with telling a table that just ordered $275 worth of food/drinks that they had to hurry because they needed this table is inexcusable
The most ridiculous thing was that the dining room had available tables at all points of the night
To top off the service we then had to wait for 20 minutes to get them to even take the bill
I recommend that the restaurant revaluates the wait staff
If you want a true world class dining experience, you must visit Flames Steakhouse
Forget the other steakhouses, because the quality of the steaks, seafood, and desserts are simply the best without compromise
The owner stands by this creed of excellence and ensures, without a doubt, that you will be satisfied beyond belief
My wife and I have been here several times and we both notice the same thing every time: We have a GREAT time! Some favorites: Filet Mignon, Surf and Turf, Maine Live Lobster (you can specify size), Jumbo Shrimp, Chopped Tomato and Avocado Salad and the decadent Zochino for dessert
Whether having a proper dinner and enjoying the ambiance, or just enjoying a drink at the bar after work, Nick and his professional staff are there to ensure your satisfaction for excellent food, drink, and a pleasant evening with your dinner companions
I was the biggest fan of Spark's Steakhouse in New York City until Nick Vulaj openned his signature Flames Steakhouse in Manhattan
I visited Flames on Gold Street and found his aged meat full of flavour and juicy till the last bite
I highly recomend to go have the best steak now before getting reservation gets to be a problem
The restaurant has a private wine cellar and an extensive wine collection
The owner helped me choose the right wine for my budget and its was great
The Best USDA Prime Dry Aged Beef, Great Appetizers, Fresh Seafood, Italian Dishes And A Superb Wine List
Beautiful Private Dining Rooms including the Wine Cellar
A Perfect Setting For Business or Private Dining
Beautiful Environment And Professonal Service
I went here for the first time on a first date having only read about it
Plus it was close to where I work
Very quiet, beautiful decor, very attentive wait staff
We had the fish, which was fantastically presented and tasted stupendous
The proprietor came personally to tell us the specials and checked on us periodically through out the meal
The best thing though was when they messed up the fish order they not only gave us each a free glass of wine, but they took that fish order off our bill!!! Amazing
I will definitely go back and tell everyone about my experience
Flames is a great new spot downtown in the finance district
I went with my girlfriends after work and we felt completely confortable in the Steakhouse
The food was great giving us all a variety of things even someone who didn't want steak
The dessert was so so so good taste the chocolate and vanilla mouse dessert
When I entered Flames I was immediatley intrigued by the hundreds of bottles of wine that line the wall -- it was just so romantic and beautiful
I ordered the baked clams originate oysters and my boyfriend got the dry-aged steak for one
It was beyond extrodinary -- we actually shared our dishes
Then for desert we shared the Zocino
It was the most romantic and peaceful dinner -- the most quality unforgettable meal my boyfriend I have had together in a long time
Flames is a sophistacted classy night out in our city that is well needed!!
I went to Flames Steakhouse for lunch and enjoyed an excellent porterhouse
The servers were very friendly and professional
I would highly recommend Flames for a relaxing and enjoyable lunch or dinner
And Be sure to order a bottle of wine they have a great selection
Dinner at Aix was one of the best meals I have ever had
The food was spectacular, as was the service
The sommelier was incredibly helpful without a touch of snobbiness


and the wine she recommended was perfect
Expensive, but worth every penny
MY FIRST CONTAC WAS ON THE PHONE , THE PERSON THAT TOOK MY RECERVATION WAS NICE AND FUNY, SHE EXPLAIN ABOUT THE FOOD AND THE RESTAURANT LIKE IF I WAS COMING TO HER HOME FOR DINNER, SHE HAD A BEAUTIFULL ACSENT, I WAS LOOKING FAWORD TO MY MEAL, ON MY ARIVAL TO A VOCE SHE WAS THERE TO WELLCOME US, I WAS AWHERE THAT I CALL LAST MIN FOR A RESERVATION BUT OUR TABLE AND SERVICE WAS EXCELENT, THANK YOU INGRID FOR A SUPER EVELING
This restaurant is amazing, and I have been meaning to review it for quite some time
I went on opening night and had the most amazing dining experience
For starters, the place was abuzz
It was exciting, the Chef was walking around the tables toward the end of the night, the waiters were smiling, it was great
The food was, as I said before, some of the best I've had in the city
The pumpkin ravioli in the sage/brown butter sauce were THE BEST I have ever had, and I make it a point to order that when any restaurant offers it because I love it so much
They were melt-in-your-mouth perfect
I understand they are not on the menu during summer, but when they reappear (hopefully they will!), they are a must try
My guest had the meatballs, which were really spectacular as well
The service was great - and the fact that it was opening night means that I should change that to 'outstanding
' The servers were nice, the host was impeccable and so welcoming, and the fact that the chef was out and about asking for opinions was pretty amazing
The only thing I'm not 100% keen on is the decor
It doesn't completely jibe with the food for me, but maybe that's just me
It doesn't hinder the restaurant in any way; it just felt cold/sterile compared to the vibe I was getting from the people and the food
Overall, I think this restaurant has definitely made its mark and will continue to do so for many years to come
Went to A Voce last night and overall I found the whole experience baffling
Had heard mixed opinions among friends, but must confess that a NY Times 3 star review made me want to see for myself
Ordered two cocktails at the bar that were served in pint mixing glasses?! The bartender explained they were out of glasses
They were also out of grapefruit juice
3 star experience? Hardly
Once seated, the waiter was affable and informed
However, the service soon dipped when the wine showed up after the appetizer was served, and half way through that, the entrees arrived
They whisked away the plates and clumsily threw down the new silverware
Really amateurish stuff
The food was actually quite good and you can tell that Andrew Carmellini can cook, but as for management and their providing a smooth and seamless experience, they really fall short
So for me, it's back to Lupa and L'Impero
My girlfriend and I visited A Voce last Thursday and throughly enjoyed our dinner
We ordered the sheeps milk ricotta and vegetable trio appetizer and both of us had pasta
The ricotta was wonderful and a great accompaniment to the bread it comes with
My pasta was extremely tooooo salty
With the proscuitto, it was just overwhelming
The ambiance is quite nice but I found it a bit cold and it was quite loud
Service was ok, not great
Our waiter wasn't around when we needed him and the busboys kept on popping in at impromtu times
They need to be more considerate of when people finish their dish and not just appear every few minutes
All in all, we had a good time and the food was good
Would return but not right away
The intimate setting, beautiful decor, had a good dinner with friends
Was a loud, as previous reviewers stated, but the food and service made up for it! Only down side, I'm 24 years old, and seemed like everyone else at the restaurant could have been my father's friends
I took my parents from out of town to A Voce, and disliked how LOUD it is in the restaurant and also how poor the service was
The saving grace is the food--which was excellent
They took 10 minutes to refill our water, they never asked if we would like another drink, and the waiter was nice but just not efficient
The pasta is great, as well as a hanger steak I got, but the lamb was not good quality
The chocolate tart we had was excellent--so in general the food is good, but the restaurant really needs to work on how loud it is and its service
We could barely hear eachother and enjoy our conversation because the loudness was so distracting
I'm not sure I would go back again, however, the food is worth a try
I've been to A Voce two times within one week
I had an amazing meal last week
Loved it so much that I brought another friend back to celebrate his birthday this week
Unfortunately, on the 2nd go round, it just didn't match the initial experience

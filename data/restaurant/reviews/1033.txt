It seems that everybody is making cupcakes these days and someone is even trying to franchise a cupcake business but Sugar Sweet Sunshine stands out above the crowd with their tasty treats
The owners are the nicest and friendliest people you will ever meet
Always a smile and a welcoming lounge area make this a must visit when you are in the neighborhood
Definitely try the Pistachio cupcake with the velvet frosting
It is to die for! Avoid the lines at the other West Village place and get your cupcakes here before the word gets out and the lines start forming outside
I love this place so much! The treats are delicious and the ladies are so sweet
Try the cupcake cake!! yum!!
my friends and i wanted to come out of the cold and use a clean place to use the bathroom and sugar sweet sunshine was just the most convenient spot at that time
we didn't know that it also carried the most delicious cupcakes in the world! normally i HATE cupcakes, but when i saw it in the display, i thought to myself, these cupcakes must be out of sight if they want people to pay for it, most cupcakes are cheesy - like the ones you make for your elementary school teacher on teacher appreciation day
I also ordered a rasberry cheescake bun and that too was delish
not as good as the cupcakes but justifiably tasty for a quick bite on the go
the place also has cute couches you can lounge on - so bring a friend and enjoy the yummy desserts!
We went to this location instead of the Murray Hill one - what a mistake
The decor was straight out of a mediocre Queens sushi joint (I live in Queens) and the food was overpriced and very average
The place prides itself on large pieces of sushi, but I just find the pieces ungainly and unappetizing
For perspective, my favorite sushi rests
in the city are Yasuda and Gari
Yasuda is clean, pure sushi and Gari is delicious and innovative
They both know that proportion and balance are key - this place did not
It's wonderful to have one of the very best sushi teams in town open an up-town presence
This restaurant, the smaller twin of the 33rd Street location, is staffed by many of the same sushi chefs and staff who rotate between the two
The fish is without question the freshest in New York, the sushi is innovative, classy and extraordinarily well done, and the staff is wonderfully friendly
Sushi Sen Nin would be the Perfect Ten
if it weren't for the prices, which are, unfortunately, perfectly in keeping with the quality :-(
This is an absolute winner in my book! The sushi is so fresh and delicious that it MELTS in your mouth
Their Matsu Sushi is the best deal there (5 pieces of sushi and crunchy tuna roll) for about $23
For dessert, get the mochi ice cream
It's a sleeper hit -- not many people get it, but they drizzle chocolate syrup over it and it's great
The service is quick, the people very nice! I LOVE Sen-nin!
The people who didn't love this place are crazy! Sure, it is expensive, but you pay for what you get
The fish was so soft, I could easily cut it with my chopsticks
It was also very fresh
The space is nice, and I think this place is pretty much a hidden treasure, so it does not crowd out
Go!
I had 2 spicy crunchy tuna rolls and 1 mango roll and they came to $21, which is not too bad
The quality of the sushi was really good, very fresh
The size of the rolls was big enough that the sushi was filling, unlike other sushi places where there so skinny they still leave you hungary
I have thrown away sushi that was cheaper than this place but the fish was not fresh to the point that eating the sushi made me nauseus
So paying a little extra for something fresh and tasty does not seem so bad
I had to write something here after reading the only review on your site
First of all, you cannot rate a Sushi restaurant on dumplings, or spicy tuna roll
The fish in this restaurant is top notch, and they will ONLY serve it fresh
I've eaten at Sen_nin 34th street for years, and have found the same standards
The servers are always courteous, and will recommend their freshest special selections which are always good
I'm very excited to have a Sushi restaurant on the Upper East Side which focuses on what sushi should be
If all you appreciate in Japanese food is Teryaki and Tempura, this is not the place for you, But if you're fed up with the avenue jointsand their club-style techno music, enjoy
I walked by and saw that this place had a rating of 27 in Zagats and I had to try it as I love sushi and am always looking for a great place
The food was not good at all
I had dumplings which were watery and had no taste and I had a spicy tuna roll which was fishy and was like eating lead
The rice they used was so heavy and mushy that I had three peices of one roll and couldn't eat any more
The person I was with had tuna pieces and claimed that they were amazing, but the rolls and the other dishes are nothing to get excited about
The service was good and the people very nice, but I will never go back when there are so many other great places
Very expensive too!!
With prices as high as Sushi or Gari, this place was a little overpriced
The sushi pieces are large (like Yama's), very fresh but it's nothing spectacular
It doesn't have much new-concept sushi like Gari's, or Nobu's
You just can't charge $9 for a regular tuna maki in this neigborhood
We spend $90 for 2, with total of about 7 pieces of sushi / 3 rolls (yes, for 2 adults) and no alcohol
Way too expensive for nothing
Indian and Middle Eastern cooking in a bright, homey setting
In Short The territory of the Indus Valley--one of the primordial cradles of humanity--spans India and part of the Middle East, as does the menu at this upper Upper West Side spot
There are plenty of familiar dishes: tandoori meat and fish, and curries aplenty
The restaurant's exalted position as one of the only Indian restaurants in the neighborhood has resulted in a brisk business
I come from the west coast, where fabulous Indian restaurants are plentiful, but I was sorely disappointed with all the Indian restaurants I tried in NY until I found this one
The food is delicious, and it is a good value by New York standards
It is one of the places I enjoy taking out-of-towners who don't want to spend a fortune
Indus Valley is definitely the best Indian restaurant on the upper west side
It's slightly more expensive than other Indian restaurants but definitely worth it
The meat is good quality and they know how to cook it, and the sauces are delicious
Fortunately, they also deliver
The chicken tikka masala that we ordered had the weirdest flavor I've ever tasted - as if ketchup had been added liberally into the sauce
definitely unlike anything I've ever tasted
For the amount of food we got, the price was not that great either
I've been to MANY indian restaurants not only in New York but also in Chicago, SF, and a few European cities
This definitely ranks as one of my favorites
The staff was very attentive and quick
I hope to be a regular
Highly recommend
I've been to many Indian restaurants in the city and I have to say this one's my new favorite
The servers were friendly and very attentive and the food was fantastic
We had the chicken samosas, the malai kofta, and chicken tikka masala -- I nearly licked my plate, it was so good
Definitely worth checking out
I am not a fan of Indian food, but I loved this place! Great food and good cocktails
I highly recommend
We just ate here, and had a delicious meal in a very pleasant setting--with our three-year old no less
the kitchen was incredibly responsive to her request for no spices (and my husband's request for Matter Paneer, even though it is not a menu item), and the food still managed to arrive relatively quickly
You must try the mango lassi: it is sprinkled with ground cardoman and is absolutely delicious!
In Short This cozy spot on Park Slope's burgeoning Fifth Avenue offers familiar takes on Vietnamese dishes, as well as some innovations
Spring rolls, both vegetarian and meat-based, grilled corn and fried dumplings are among the starters
Entrees include noodle dishes such as pad thai, country-stewed salmon, pho and lemongrass chicken
House cocktails, like potent tropical margaritas, are a popular complement
Had a similar experience with ordering takeouts from them as previous reviewers
The food is good, the portions are very small, and the price
jesus
waaay too much for what you get
If they only had larger portions, and/or cheaper prices, it would have been an awesome restaurant
But given the portions size and price, I can't recommend it wholeheartedly
I recently visited this place with some friends on a Saturday night
It was crowded but they were able to seat us after a 10 minute wait at the bar
Everyone we encountered was fun and friendly--the bartender chatted with us as he prepared cocktails (raspberry mojito--yum) and our server was mellow and helped a Mexican friend who doesn't know Vietnamese food find her way around the menu

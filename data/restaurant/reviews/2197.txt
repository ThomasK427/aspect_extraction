The food is delicious, cooked to perfection
The staff is friendly and knowledgeable
I highly recommend this steakhouse, but be sure to make reservations
Whenever I come to the city, I make Keens my first restaurant stop
Its the best place for steak in Manhattan and is equaled only by Peter Luger in Brooklyn
I love the atmosphere, the stylish service, the classic side dishes and the variety of steaks
Its usually crowded, but what would you expect if its that good? Im going back!
I was invited to Keens Steakhouse by my wife for our anniversary, along with my twin sister and her husband
A great surprise it was indeed
I ordered a Prime Rib which was enormous and tender, my brother-in-law ordered three huge lamb chops (also tender), while the ladies shared a 6 lb steamed lobster - perfect
Instead of wine, we all ordered Port Ellen Single Malt, expensive but of almost mythic size and as memorable as any Bordeaux or Napa Valley wine
A great evening, thanks!
Returning to Sydney, NSW after three weeks of steak-eating in the USA, I need to declare Keens Steakhouse as the absolute winner - numero uno!! Tried it three times, each time as dependable as the others
Huge Porterhouse and Shell steaks, monstrous mutton chops, while my wife stuck to Dover Sole (which she equaled to the best at Wilton's in London) and a marvelous Maine steamed lobster which I had to help her to finish
What a great and unexpected surprise! It's very busy, mates, so call ahead
WOW!
the food was great; friendly staff
The chef personally came out to greet us when I told the waiter that the food was great! And we also got free dessert
Keens is always a pleasure
If you like perfectly aged meat, this is the place! I recently had exemplary oysters Rockefeller and the most sublime lamb chops (have them medium-well so the fat renders)
Though there are plenty of seafood and poultry dishes, and salads, too
The service is expert and accommodating, the historic ambience is seductive, and you can tell that the management really cares by the little touches
I love the changing selection of wines by the glass, too, which are always interesting
No wonder they've been getting so much good press lately
I was not impressed
After making reservations for 10 and stressing it was a birthday party, we were seated at a cramped table by the kitchen
The food was good, but I've had better at many steakhouses in Brooklyn for a quarter of the price
The service was unacceptable, the side dishes were brought to the table after the meal was almost finished
The server was obviously overworked and could not devote the attention a large party requires
On the the plus side we were seated immediately and the portions were good
On whole I found Keens to be overpriced, overcrowded and understaffed
I would not care to repeat the experience
service was very good
lobster and shrimp cocktails both excellent
the t-bone steak was average at best, a bit grizzly and certainly not a top steakhouse usual
bloody mary $8
75 served in an 8 plain 8 ounce glass with a limp piece of celery
billed for 2 drinks when we only had one
appetizers, soup, dessert wer all excellent
definitely not worth the price
had Thanksgiving dinner here with a party of 7
Everything, from drinks to dessert was exemplary, the service impeccable and the atmosphere surroundings low key and understated
The rooms are well maintained and warm
The prime rib was huge!
Best steak, hands down, in New York, without hoopla and fanfare
Careful service and gracious ambience
And oh, those mutton chops for lamb lovers!!!
Excellent food in the dressy part of the restaurant and in the informal section of the restaurant as well
You know you're in a nice place when the bus boys are twice as old as you are
hehe (I'm 18) But this place was amazing
I actually chose it based on reviews from this site
My water was refilled about a dozen times, and the steak was unbelievable
Get it cooked RARE! Fried calamari great as well
My thanks to my waiter Jonathan
Great Place!
This IS one of the best steakhouses in New York
From the moment you walk in you are taken by the thousands of pipes which line the walls, some with historical significance
Beyond the pleasent setting it only gets better
Service is great and the steaks are why you are there
They are fantastic
The Mutton chop is superb
A little on the expensive side though even for a top quality steakhouse
Have been going to Keen's for many years and have never been disappointed
Great steaks and old world atmosphere
The iceburg lettuce with bleu cheese is terrific
Great for dinner before a garden event
They are aware of the fuunctions and ask if you are attending and adjust the service as required
This place is fantastic! I'm here at least once a month and I've never been disappointed
Take your buddies
Leave the wife and kids at home
This is simply the best steakhouse in New York
I've been to just about all of them, and was skeptical when I read the ratings here about this being better than most of the others
It's true
The meat was absolutely amazing, as were the sides
Atmosphere was great, very old world New York but very inviting and comfortable
The service was great as well, and we were there on Friday night in prime time
You won't be disappointed!
Best steaks in town, no hype
Older than Peter Luger and infinitely better, not to mention more convenient
Real Prime USDA meat, which most steakhouses in town don't even have
Of course the mutton chop is the stuff of dreams, no one even competes there
great steak, great service, fabulous ambience, wonderful wine list, good value
No run of the mill steakhouse, Keens reliably combines a warm, intimate, yet somehow sporty atmosphere and excellent service by a personable and knowledgable staff with great food -- everytime
Beats those big noisy steakhouse dining rooms hands down
The steaks are the best and the crabcakes are to die for
We are never disappointed at Keens
Every time I go to Keens I think to myself, it can't possibly be as good as I remember
It is
Every time
The porterhouse for two is amazing
The service is impecable
It's not as touristy as Peter's or Chris', Sparks or Smith Wollensky - in my opinion all over-priced establishments survivng on tourists and hype
This place has been around forever for a reason
Give it a try
The first time I came, I had the juicy, delicious NY Sirloin steak
The mashed potatoes that came with it had the right amount of butter mixed in
The second time I came, I had the Chateaubriand, which was so tender, there was no need for a knife
The mushrooms we ordered on the side were minimally seasoned, so you can enjoy it's natural flavor
The third time I came I had the Filet Mignon, which was also juicy and tender
The crudite that gets served before every meal is also delicous

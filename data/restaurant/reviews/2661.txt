Order the Godiva chocolate cake for dessert to complete the perfect meal
Sometimes a little noisy, and the speech at the beginning gets a little tiresome, but all in all a fun place to go to for good steak
The debate will always rage about Luger being the best versus some others like Sparks and Morton's
But for the overall best steak eating experience of your life, go to Morton's
The steaks are juicy, tender, flavorful and are consistently made
I've been there a dozen times, often with my steak club, and have never been disappointed
Best of all, the service is great, the place looks nice as opposed to the german beer-hall stylings of SW and Luger's -and - did I mention the dessert? They have at Morton's the greatest dessert conceived by man
If you like chocolate even a little you MUST have the Godiva Cake
Molten chocolate perfection
My god
I'm telling you, overall this is the best steakhouse in the city
And me and my steak club buddies have been to them all
Just go
this is the steak house where men are men and women are women
You can never go wrong here for food, wine, service and most of all dessert
remember to order with entree's or you will be disappointed
or settle for the godiva chocolate cake
You will never eat chocolate again after this small piece of heaven
Wonderfull presentation,great service superb food
Great seafood as well as steak and chicken
My boyfriend and I ate here twice so far in the last few months and we both love it, but our credit cards don't! I would recommend this place for a celebatory occassion, it can be very expensive, but enjoyable! Get the dark chocolate cake! You won't regret it!!
Exclusive of the Financial Center restaurants, which are closed more often than open, you can count the number of BPC sit-down restaurants on one hand
Foxhounds is the cream of the crop, but only by default
The rustic charm, the smiling BPC locals and the staff's over-the-top friendliness will make you feel like someone just yelled Norm! Unfortunately, the food is not memorable and not inexpensive and the bar gets louder as the locals get drunker
There is no reason to travel out of your way to visit foxhounds but, if you're visiting Battery Park, this place is fun and comfy
I moved into Battery Park City just over a month ago, and have been to Foxhounds about a dozen times already
Very good pub food, and a great staff (Mary the bartender knew my name after the second time I was there) that makes you feel welcome
It can get crowded smokey at the bar, but pull up a chair, squeeze your way in, and make yourself at home!
foxhounds is the shining star in battery park city
the drinks are HUGE, served by NYC's nicest barkeeps
the food is VERY GOOD at reasonable prices
last, but not least, the owner, managers, barkeeps, wait staff and bus staff are ALL super nice people who alway greet you with a smile
don't miss it


This is a place that will cater to your requests on the menu
The food is consitently good and the bartenders and managers treat the patrons like family
We went to Steamers Landing based on a lunch recommendation
We were seated immediately and had a nice view of the river
Unfortunately, as we looked at the menu we could see that it was unlikely to be anything exceptional, but we hoped for the best and looked forward to enjoying the meal
We ordered littleneck clams for an appetizer, a salad each and a seafood pizza to share
The clams arrived - 8 small clams for $11
The broth was so full of garlic pieces, parsley and whatever other green stuff was chopped up we had to scrape it off
The broth was very salty as well; we couldn't even enjoy dipping our bread in it
Salads and pizza were okay but not exceptional in any way
Overall a disappointing experience
Go there for the view but don't expect to be impressed with the menu selection (small) or cuisine
In late September 2004 I dined at Steamers Landing with a few friends for dinner, it was a wonderful experience
The view in incomparible, he staff and owners are warm, welcoming, and make you feel as if you are old friends
The menu is expansive and creative, and has something to please every palette
The foold was great, especially my crabcakes and my husband's steamed mussle, which were served in a huge bowl in a delicious butter, garlic sauce
Great place!
This is the best place to sit outside and enjoy the parade of people along the esplanade and boats along the river
On a summer night it is so nice to sit on the patio, with the light breezes off the river and the trees overhead
The food is better than okay, and the service is adequate, although the prices are a bit high for what it is
All things considered, however, it's the best dining option in Battery Park City
The dinner terrace is a lovely place to watch the sunset over Hudson river
The food however does not even attempt to compete with the atmosphere, and is not cheap either (same goes for wines by the glass)
Salmon ordered rare arrived virtually dry
Stick with something safe and simple, and enjoy the view
I went here for dinner with my wife recently and at the end of the evenings, left the restaurant with the feeling that the experience was average at best
It is a relatively small restaurant, crowded with a few too many tables
The food was good, but not good enough to justify the prices
The decor made me feel as though we were in an expensive Red Lobster
There are plenty of better restaurant choices in NYC
My fiance and I went here randomly when looking for a restaurant for dinner
The prices are great (10-15 per entree), and the food was fantastic
The menu is large too
Try the Hunan Chicken and the Crispy Shredded Beef
Good stuff
The location isn't the best, and the ambience is like any other Chinese restaurant, but who cares if the food and value is good
The food is very good with an entertaining menu selection
This is also a very nice place to go for drinks after work or a long day of touring the city
The locals give it a casual, fun flavor that is both down home and sophisticated at the same time
And they have the sexiest bartender in Manhattan there too (called Stevie)
He won't leave you unsatisfied if you want a good, stiff drink to take the edge off the day! Peppy conversation gives visitors a look at the real New York
GO THERE!
I used to get delivery from this place on nights I worked late in Lower Manhattan
The dishes, according to my Chinese coworkers, are authentic Sichuan and Shanghai style and are surprisingly great quality for takeout/delivery prices
Since changing jobs and now uptown, I still crave Yangtze and have gone back many times in groups to eat there at the restaurant
Being pretty far downtown in Battery Park City, I never have a problem getting a table, the service is really polite, food is consistently good
I typically end dinner with a nice walk along the waterfront to work off the calories
To people who don't stray far from the typical Beef and Broccoli or General Tso's Chicken, the large menu selection can be kind of intimidating, so here are my recommendations: Appetizers: Drunken Chicken Entrees: Miso Fish, Braised Chicken with Napa Cabbage, Beef with Chili Pepper, Conch
I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about because this place is awesome! The pizza is easily the best in the neighborhood and actually is one of the best in all of manhattan
The rolls and entrees are also superb
My only gripe is that they charge too much for toppings otherwise I would give this place a 10 out of 10
Below average New York Pizzeria with unreasonably expensive prices
Stick with Dominos
I just ordered from Picasso's and was very disappointed
The crust was hard and tasted stale
It appeared that they used a cheese pizza cooked earlier that day or the day before and just added the raw topping to it, then delivered it
I will never order from here again
It was expensive, too!
After moving from the culinary paradise that is the Far West Village, my husband and I have yet to find a BPC restaurant that compares to what we're used to
That said, SouthWest NY is one of the best places down here
The view alone is worth a visit
The interior is actually quite well-designed (except for the sweltering bathrooms) and is suited for both large parties and small
We took my parents for Sunday brunch and sat outside; my father, who hates New York, felt like he was on a relaxing vacation
(Of course, that's true of pretty much ALL of Battery Park City
) We all enjoyed our meals despite their being out of the house champagne (for my mimosa)

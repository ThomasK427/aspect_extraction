The blue fin tuna, good portion
The bleu cheese tuna was out of this world
If you go I would definitely recommend a sushi omakase
The live eel, lobster all excellent
Very creative rolls
The arugula roll is very creative and delicious
Also great sushi specials
The regular food was definitely not worth it
I wasn't sure if I was eating shortribs or cardboard
The chawanmushi was just wrong
The desserts were spectacular
I had a strawberry custard cake which blew my mind it was so good
Creme caramel was perfect as well as a sesame apple dessert
The Maitre'd was very polite
Bond Street has been serving very good sushi for many years to an increasingly less hip crowd
The reservationists and hosts can be a bit off-putting and arrogant, given how uncrowded they can be, but the bar can be quite the scene and your date will be impressed
The sushi bar area is particularly fun to dine in because the sushi chefs great you loudly and cheerfully as you arrive and depart
Get points by making a reservation via Open Table (which indicates just how desperate they are getting but Bond St
will always be around)
The only problem I had with Bond Street was that it was hard to find, as a tourist
Besides that, I think it was some of the best sushi i have ever had
The service was great and we were seated promptly even though we were approximately an hour late
If you are single and hoping to mingle, I would definitely recommend sitting downstairs
Upstairs is nice but much quiter and the tables are too far apart to talk to any beautiful ladies sitting nearby
The longe in the basement was packed with beautiful people and we had a great time there as well
For what you pay, Bond Street failed to impress, the Sushi on the night was average
The wait to get a table was outrageous, and the waiters need to start using what few brain cells they have instead of hoping to be asked to be the next Calvin Klein model
I always come here with a frame of mind
First of all the sushi is great and with that i can understand the place can be crowded and busy
So i can live with a little wait, especially with the cute guys waiting by the bar
This place is one of my favorite sushi places but not because of the sushi
The atmosphere is very trendy and the people very chic
The sushi is pretty good but not what you come for
You come for the scene and the people watching
Tables are really close together but that shouldn't stop you from chatting up the cuties next to you
Of course with any Hot scene, its gonna cost you a pretty penny
As far as the food goes, it is inventive, but certainly not excellent
And the service was indeed shoddy
We asked for a birthday cake for a friend, which was completely dismissed
When we asked the waited what happened to the missing cake, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away
It's unfortunate the service can ruin this place
I took my significant other to this place for a birthday dinner the other night, and it was a disaster!   Anyway, the food was admittedly delicious, but during the meal a waiter accidentally slammed my significant other in the head with his elbow
He barely apologized and when we confronted him about it, was very defensive and tried to say that it was our fault
We called over the manager, who was apologetic and sent over a free dessert and free drinks, but this did not make up for a ruined birthday dinner and a sore head
Even putting this incident aside, the service was at best, spacey and indifferent, and at worst, arrogant, and full of itself
They need more professionals and fewer black-clad actors with self-consciously mussed haircuts
This place needs to get over itself
It isn't 1999 any more!
Went to Bond Street last night and had a fantastic time
We were seated promptly and were honored, without any trouble, a table change
We did not have the same experience other reviewers have had with the service at all
Everyone was prompt and more than polite, particularly the manager, although I can't remember her name
The food was incredibly good and the portions were hardly stingy
No one at our table was able to finish their meal! After at least 15 drinks for 4 people, two appetizers each, two entrees, scores of sushi and caviar, two desserts, and expresso the bill came to 400
00 without tip
I'd highly recommend it for a special birthday!
This place has turned me into a sushi snob
I won't go any where else
Bond Street has some of the most incredible sushi you will ever put in your mouth!! Ambiance could be better, and it is pricey, but the food makes up for all of this
INCREDIBLE!
Lots of fun at this trendy, hip restaurant
I've heard of the bad service but it actually was incredibly good
They seated us and actully added 1 more to the table last second
The bartenders were friendly while I waited and the food was good
It was spaced out (we had the 80pp), toro appetizer was so smooth, we had quail, numerous sushi, soup, pumpin puree and more
It just kept coming
All in all for 4 people w/tip came out to $500, not bad at all
Perhaps I was there on an off-night, but I had a terrible experience at Bond Street
While at first glance the ambience appears chic, the obnoxious service and cramped seating destroy any and all luster of coolness
The hostess didn't know we still wanted to eat after we waited at the bar for over an hour and she skipped right over our name on the list
After being seated and what felt like an eternity for us to receive our food, the sushi was surprisingly decent
It was enjoyed, however, on a 2 x 2 table for 3 people as 2 of us sat crammed on the end of a bench and the third on a mini-stool
The crowning moment, however, was when the hostess rolled her eyes at us when we asked for change paying our bill
I was wholly unimpressed with this place
I understand understated lighting, but when the only light for your meal comes from the 2 votives on your table and the glaring neon sign across the room, you know that something is wrong
Ignoring that fact, the atmosphere was quite cool
Service was sketchy
The food: although the seared tuna was very good, the $60 tasting menu included some of the toughest quail I've ever had to fight my way through
Sushi was good but not noteworthy
Hake flavored with miso was overpoweringly sweet
Desserts were actually the best part of the meal, but that's probably because we were still hungry
Finally, after waiting 10 minutes for our coats (no queue, they'd just misplaced them), they handed them out in no particular order so that the lady in our party ended up struggling with her own coat
Verdict: nice decor, but don't go there for the food
Service was okay, atmosphere was cool, food blew
If you are going to be spending this kind of money for sushi, there are hundreds of better and in 99% of the cases cheaper alternatives in the city
The sushi was not only mediocre, but tiny
I would never recommend this place to anyone
love, love, love, those boys in the lounge! The food is worth going for, but the boys in behind the bar in the lounge are what keep me coming back! Especially the one they call EROCK????
Having eaten at Yama the night before, I was sorely disappointed that the rolls were 1/4 the taste and 1/4 the size, and with half the alcohol ordered, this meal was still double the price
I thought it was supposed to be better than Nobu- this place was a joke in comparison- Please don't waste your time, especially since the people working there are totally clueless
Bond Street has consistently great sushi and rolls
I especially love their spicy tuna roll and the sesame shrimp roll
The atmosphere is great and so is the service
I went on a Sunday night so the scene was a little less crazy than usual and it was nice
The sushi itself is also very fresh and the waitress really helped by recommending the best things on the menu
The desserts are also wonderful
The price is what I expectwhen I go to a great sushi restaurant so it didn't surprise me that it was a little pricey
This was our first time at Bond Street, and the prices were absurd!! The portions were small, and the lighting was way too dark
The food was good, but not worth the price
The cheapest roll was eight bucks!!!! If I ever won the mega millions, I may go back, but that is the only time

The rest of the food is excellent, but these two dishes stand out
I have seen alot of negative comments regarding the wait staff, but I have never had a problem
Sure, the women are not cheerleader with a tray types, but if you need pizzazz with your food, you should be eating at a chain restaurant, not a busy little bistro in the village
They are just way to busy to chit chat - which is how I prefer it since they seem to get my order right the first time
i fell in love with Tartine when i was a freshman in collage
now i go there with a baby cart
i've been there so many times and never had a bad experience
only advice; if you are very hungry or the weather is bad, have another place in mind to dine before you go
it's a small place, so you might have to wait outside a while to be seated
There is something very special about a restaurant that can offer amazing delights at reasonable prices
I did not find the wait staff to rude at all, how involved do you really want them in your meal right? I had no idea, how wonderful my dinner would be! I could not have been happier with my escargots and my Tart Fine
I was lucky enough not to wait on a line, but one did form
BYOB policy
How else to enjoy decent tasting, decently priced French food then with a normally-priced bottle of wine
Bring a date and 2 bottles--one for the wait and one dinner
we love Tartine
We love the location, the decor, the great food, the incredibly delicious deserts, the great BYOB policy
With great ffo and a big tip, you 're out of there for under 35 a person
The waitresses are horrible, but who the hell cares
We have been there at least 30 timnes in the past 10 years, and I can't wait to return
Great food; however, you're bound to wait awhile
I've seen long lines, but if you're in leisurely mood, it's nice to bring a bottle of wine and dine, because the neighborhood and French feel is memorable
i had no idea how small this restaurant would be
although there was a line outside, we only wound up waiting for about 10 minutes
The interior is small and cramped, but i didn't feel like we were on top of the people next to us
I can't be sure but i think the bread they gave us in the bread basket was left over from those before us
The food was okay, the roasted pear salad was amazing, the chicken pot pie - too creamy, and the steak frites nothing to write home about
It was still a nice night, wait staff was attentive and it is a nice option to bring your own wine
Big drawback, after we left we REEKED of food
Guess it was the close quarters??
This restaurant, while extremely small, was an excellent choice for dinner
The service was attentive and pleasant
The food was delicious; perfect bistro food
Desserts were delectable
The BYOB aspect was great (I love BYOB restaurants!)
But you should understand that saying the place is small is an understatement
If you don't like close quarters, then you might want to find another place
However, if you view close quarters as a chance to meet new people or get close to that special someone, then this is your place!
I'd been told how cozy and romantic Tartine was before I went on a date, and my dinner there totally confirmed this
Tartine is one definitive example of how small restaurants often have more personality
The dinner fare was French-influenced and light, but satiating
I'd leave room for their enticing desserts
Even the coffee was good!
Had our best (and least expensive) breakfast while in NY at Tartine
Yes, we had a bit of a wait, and yes, the service was indifferent at best
The food, however, was marvelous, and at $10 per person, a great value
It was lovely to sit outside and people-watch
Came on a Wednesday nite with another couple and even though there were no seats available, we had a great time sipping our wine and enjoying the tranquility of the West Village while we were waiting (only about 20min)
Dinner was absolutely fabulous, completely reasonable, and our waitress had some great suggestions from the menu
Probably better to go on an off-night, as the space is intimate, but no one wanted to leave and I'm having a hard time convincing my friend to eat anywhere else!!
My second visit to Tartine was dinner on my first date
Things haven't changed much it's always packed even on a stormy rainy night! Food was fairly pleasant and simple
Service was fairly decent
My date seem to enjoy the spicy chicken but they fries was overwhelming
My grilled salmon was tasty but nothing special
The desset of a light raspberry chocolate mousse cake was amazing
At least this night we got better seating closer to the window with a view compared to my last visit near the desserts
Haven't too much problem with their service compared to everyone's review
With the exception of one late day when I came in for caffe and the waitress nearly rushed us out since dinner was coming around
Btw, to the 'anonymous' regarding my comment on dating
Seems like you're the type who doesn't pay for anything
Sugar Daddy I am not
If you try to avoid pretense as I do, give this place a miss
Not five minutes after paying, we decided to wait out a storm, and order coffee/dessert
Our waitress proceeded to argue: I have a party of 6 I need to seat, and you've already paid
I can't tell them now they have to wait an hour
Is this your first time here? Maybe you don't know how we do things here
We explained that we changed our minds, despite the fact that we already paid, and wanted to order coffee after all
She walked away in a huff, and had the BUSBOY pass on the same message: you can't order coffee because you've already paid (have these people never heard of someone changing their mind? We were flabbergasted
) Since we had no desire to stay then, we left: taking more than half our original tip with us
It has well-crafted drinks, a classy atmosphere, and the service is generally efficient and professional
However, there are a few annoying problems
The service is cold and standoffish at times
They're not rude, but I didn't exactly feel welcome
For example, the last time I was there the bartender seemed visibly irritated that I would ask him for a drink instead of the waitress
When I got the bill, I asked the waitress why there were extra charges and she became defensive and smirked, Well, I can get the bill if you want! OK great
Make me feel like a cheap bastard, just because the only amount on the bill is the total--no other charges like tax, drink amounts, tobacco fees (I didn't smoke a thing), etc
Anyway, the fees are not a big deal, but if I'm paying 50 bucks for three mixed drinks, I expect a little more
Meticulousy hand crafted cocktails
Fine Cigars
One of the only places in New York to legally light up a cigar and enjoy a fine cognac, whisky, port
Remember - they have an uptown location (a bit more formal) - also a Cigar Bar - Lexington Bar And Books
Elegant atmosphere, great service
Just opened a location in Prague, Czech Rep
and are doing one in Bucharest
Wow, I'm not sure why so many people are spitting vitriol about this place
Granted, I've only been there once and it was right after work
The place is beautiful and laid back, the service prompt and accurate, good tunes rocking through the place, and other bar patrons didn't seem at all pretentious or self-important
I specifically made a mental note that I'd be coming back, and that's just what I'm planning tonight
Finding bars off the beaten path with a little character are what makes life fun in Manhattan
I think this place rocks and should definitely be tried at least once before anyone gives any credence to these bad reviews
Who knows? Maybe they're just jealous bar owners nearby trying to compete with this fine establishment
It's not as snooty as people make it out to be
Go on a weekday for a quiet beer, the bartender is really nice and there is a mellow feeling, no hype, no pressure
I believe that some people immediately go to some palces with attitude prepared and then they have no fun!
I went to the Hudson bar with my boyfriend and the guy at the front door was extremely rude
I was told there some real snobs in there, but he was the only one I encountered
It's too bad the help has such a bad attitude
I will definitely not return just on account of his behavior
So they can mix a drink, big deal

He was like, Oh sorry the computer is not working propery
A server came shortly after that with a cheeseburger, which is not what i ordered
Again, the bartendar said sorry
You would think he'd comp me a drink, but he didn't
Everyone else whom had ordered food at the bar received theirs, and I still had not received mine
I noticed how overwhelmed, and disorganized he was when handling the other customers around the bar
So it could not be the computer, it was the fool behind the bar
After an hour and change of waiting, i finally left
I am really disappointed because I live in Harlem and want to support the establishment there
The place looked really nice, and the clientele was great: Business professionals, good looking people
I hope they improve soon!
I went to the Harlem Grill a couple of months ago with a large group, about 12 people
We arrived in waves and they seated us anyway
But, if you have to wait, the lounge area is a perfect place to do it
The drinks are fantastic! Our server was polite and attentive, despite the busy-ness of the restaurant
My group was not the easiest to please and yet she managed
The food, from appetizers to dessert, was excellent and well-presented
The ambiance is laid-back, cat-daddy cool, from the music in the backgroud to the lighting
This resaturant is sexy, sophisticated and comfortable all in one
Simply put: Harlem Grill took me back to the Harlem I used to know
This past weekend, my family and I celebrated three family members birthday with a night out at The Grill
It was a little packed when we got there, but once we got to our table, it was great
The food was off da hook!!! They have these grilled shrimp that you can get with garlic mashed potatoes
Oh, my goodness, I had to order a second plate
They were SO good
They go even better with the Moet that I ordered along with it
Overall we had a really good time and it wasn't really all that expensive cuz I have spent more money at other places
I really recommend this place as a great place for a date or to take a family member to just relax and have some good food drinks
I reserved a table for eight for a Friday night
Neither one of my girlfriends nor I had ever been to Harlem Grill
It was nothing like we expected
We were all impressed with the setting
Our table was set up all the way in the back and our waitress was pleasant and the hospitality was great! Food was fresh, hot and delicious! I recommend this place for friends, couples, families
However, by 10: pm it becomes a classy singles crowd by the bar
So families might want to go earlier
Cleanliness and food are most important to me and this place definitely past the test
Harlem can use a few more lounges like Harlem Grill
P
S try the Mango Cosmopolitan it was Great!
on 5/21/05 a couple of us met up at the Harlem Grill
This place has a bar, lounge restaurant! The waitresses were nice, the atmosphere was just right
The food music was great! I love this place
It was our first time going there and it was worth the money
The prices are a lil steep so do not go half stepping
This is a place for high rollers
Everbody looked great, especially the men
Lenny Green was there
He made my mom feel extra special on her b-day! He gave us all kinds of goodies! took pictures with her! He look good! He look better and younger in person! He is really down to earth
We got all types of Kiss Fm goodies
i am glad we went there even though the show got canceled
This place is for the mature crowd
I love this place!
I have been to the Harlem Grill three times and each dining experience has been wonderful
For appetizers, the braised short ribs and grits are to die for! The lobster ravioli was excellent, too
My favorite main dish is the pork chop - a big cut of meat cooked to perfection
The service has always been polite, professional and attentive
The wine compliments the menu very nicely
Monday nights they have a live blues band and the atmosphere on Friday night was like a big, friendly party with everyone dancing
I'd go back there in a heartbeat
Hey the food was great and different, the service was excellent, the wine list unmatched and I got to sit next to Stevie Wonder who was having dinner at the table next to me
If you want to experience the Harlem and have a romantic, lively, exciting evening with great vibes and music, get up to The Grill
My wife and I and our friends all took a cab and in 15 minutes we were transported in time and space
Awesome!
I went to the Harlem Grill with my father who was visiting
The place was nicely decorated and a great looking date spot
I was very excited that Harlem had a very upscale looking place for the upwardly mobile Black crowd
until we tried to get seated
Took about an hour for us to get a table
Then the waitress proceeded to tell us everything that wasn't on the menu; it's a pretty slim menu so it was basically everything
An hour later someone brought out 2 red snapper; we ordered salmon, plus we hadn't even gotten our drinks
Our food came another 45 minutes later- they were 'rushing' so it was burnt on the outside and sushi on the inside
She tried to offer us free dessert, but of course the kitchen was already closed
I won't visit this restaurant again-not worth the headache!
Hard to believe all the negative feed-back I read here because my experience was out of this world! The Harlem Grill is classy, intimate, and sexy
The food I shared with my date was lovely and tasty and the service was great! This restaurant is definitely on my list of great date places
The night I went we met the owner and he was very hospitable and kind
He let us know a 3 piece band was about to start up and comped us our dessert
The chicken and pork chop dishes were spot on and the music was smooth and wonderful
Check this spot out for a slick date location
I live in Soho and it was well worth the cab trip uptown
We had 11:15 brunch reservations only to find out after we got there that they don't start seating until noon
Once we were eventually seated and ordered our food it took almost one hour for the first of ten plates to come out and the food was cold
The food came out one dish at a time and at least 5 minutes apart
We were never told what the hold up was
We asked for the manager who told us that it was their first time serving brunch, to be patient and that our bill would be discounted
While eating, the room started filling up with smoke from the kitchen and after a three hour ordeal we left feeling dissatisfied and smelling like we were victims of a grease fire
NEVER again will I be going there
Easter Sunday was Harlem Grill's first attempt at serving brunch to the Harlem crowd
Unfortunately, it was a disaster from start to finish
They were taking reservations for 11:15am, but when our party got there, we were told that they wouldn't start serving until 12pm! When we were finally seated, we sat for over an hour, after which time only one member of our party got her meal
People left in droves
When my order finally came out, it was a stack of buttermilk pancakes, beautiful golden on the top, and COMPLETELY CHARRED on the other side
My friend's waffle was bone cold when she got it, and she had to send it back
Needless to say, some of us left
Although the owner offered a 50% discount, what good is it when your meal is inedible and your wait time exceeds an hour? Very poor showing for Harlem Grill
Some friends and I went to Harlem Grill and were VERY disappointed!!! The salmon was overcooked and dry, the snapper in the crockpot was not seasoned and over cooked as well
The crabcake was definitely not LUMP by any means!!!! And the lobster ravioli was actually cheese ravoli with a SMALL piece of lobster on top
When I complained to the manager did not apologize and walked away from me in mid-sentence
THEN sent over some type of security guard to ask me to walk out SIDE DOOR!!! which I refused and didn't go out of
I politely went out the front door of which I came

In Short Located between Times Square and Rockefeller Center, this family-friendly seafood restaurant, which seats 165, is a convenient place to go for an express lunch or pre-theater dinner
Menu highlights include stone crabs, yellowfin tuna steak, jumbo lump crab cakes, steak and burgers and Key lime pie for dessert
This was my 2nd time here and my 2nd time with a problem- the mgmt last summer was pleasant and righted the situation- this time we had to do battle with the manager over what amounted to a $40 mistake resulting from miscommunication
The waitress was sweet but the manager had a patronizing attitude
He did give in and take it off the bill but it ruined the overall experience and made us late for our show
Also the pre-theater menu has taken a turn for the worse from what it was last year
With the exception of the chicken the pre-theater entrees were served ala-carte- no veggies, no starch- four scallops or a pice of fish
The apps were terrific though- I would recommend ordering a drink at the bar and sharing those as opposed to dinner
I for one will not go back
I thought this restaurant wasn't all that its racked up to be
My Boyfriend and I weren't impressed at all, the food had absolutely no seasoning
Why pay someone to do something you can do yourself? How hard is it to take a lobster are boil it in hot water till it turns red
I'll pass on a second visit to this restaurant
All aspects of this restuarant are good at this price
If I have to be picky, the waiter forgot to bring our bread; the seafood pasta's lobster was overcooked while the paste was undercooked
The ahi tuna starter PAR EXCELLENCE! Ditto the fried calamari
I personally enjoy the fliet migon a great deal (not overcooked like most other steak places)
Not necessary a great value for the quality of the food, but the great service and superb location warrant your serious consideration
What an amazing experience!!!!!! I went there on a buisness lunch, greeted at the door by two charming professionals
One gentleman and one lady, not sure of there titles but none the less they both entertained us and took care of us
The food was better then average the kitchen was very fast and there was a wine director working the room talking to every table which was amazing for a restaurant like this
I will be back
Make sure to try the crabcakes
We found the food to be superior
I had the crabcakes and my wife the cippino
She said the piece of lobster was slightly overcooked but otherwise the dish was very good
The crabcakes were nearly 100% crab with just the right amount of seasoning
Service was prompt and attentive without being overbearing
The food is just ok and the cost is too expensive for the price
The wait-staff and management are excellent but they need a new chef! The chicken was shoestringed, I wouldn't recommend that
The cobbler, a bit dry
I would say they need some new chefs in the kitchen if they want people to get their money's worth
Nice place for young couples
Food was excellent
Service was great, staff was very friendly and nice Crispy Atlantic Calamari was delicious! Will definitely return! Thnak you!!!
We went with a group of friends from work after finding it on Citysearch
I had lobster, others had crab, shrimp, etc
Everyone was quite happy with the food
The service was very prompt
We'll be back
I came hear during lunch and it was very tasty
The wine was good and the seafood was very fresh! The interior/ambience was perfect and much better than the other places in the neighborhood
what a joke this place is! went tuesday night, party of 4, we all had chowder and stuffed lobsters
first off it took forever to get our drinks then even longer to get the chowder, to top it all off, no soup spoons when the soup did arrive
it took 40 minutes sfter we finished soups to get our lobsters
they were only 2 pounders
the place was also empty! no manager came to the table to appologize and all the server can do was blame the kitchen
will never go back nor will i ever recommend!!
I loved the quaint atmosphere
Service was excellent and food tasted great! Loved the live music, unique
Talia's Steakhouse is great! The wait staff is unbelievable courteous and eager to serve
The owner is a great guy - very friendly
The food was excellent as well
The chocolate souffle was amazing! We'll be back again
Our experiance was miserable from the start
Not a single person was at a table when we walked in, but we were asked if we had a reservation, that was continuous with other people following in seating them in the back by the kitchen
A third of the menu isn't even available on a saturday, which is crazy considereing that is one of the biggest days to each out and the menu is extrememly limited
Then the steak was fatty and they only have one salad dressing
The service was MISERABLE! I will never eat here again
It was a waste of money and time
Tahlia's steak house was a huge miss
my wife and I,wanted a relaxing evening with good food
when we got there,we were seated promptly,in a cozy corner ordered some sushi,and then later the main dish,and some red wine
The steak was sizzling and delicious,and the roasted chicken was heaven
the waitress was very friendly and helpful,and the dessert really put a finishing touch on a romantic night
went there last week with my wife and another couple (hi moshe!) great food atmosphere and service! I recoment Talia's to anyone who want a relaxing night out
Great ambience
Perfect for a first date
But here's a tip: don't order cheese on your burger
Other than that, loved the band and the fries
Talia's Steakhouse is a good restaurant
It's your average kosher steak house: nothing exceptional, nothing bad
The waiters and waitresses are always super friendly, even though some can be very clumsy
The steaks are fine, not the best you'll find in the city but you get what you paid for as this place is not (too) expensive
The ambience is fine and the bar offers a very diverse wine list as well as lots of liquors and scotch
It's too bad the owner (which seems to terrify its employees) got rid of their spectacular Opera singing waiter!
My family and I celebrated my dad's birthday at Talia's Steakhouse, and had a great time
Having made a reservation, we were immediately sat; a beautiful restaurant with nice music playing in the background
The meal arrived just as we were finishing the appetizers, each good portions
We finished the evening with desserts, complete with the wait staff singing Happy Birthday to my dad
All together, and excellent evening!
I really wanted to to treat my friend for a nice dinner and I asked him what his favorite restaurant is
He replied, Talias Steakhouse
We made online reservation through opentable
com
When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly Maitre d' who accompanied us to our table
I ordered 16 ounce rib eye and my friend ordered the hamburger
The rib eye and the hamburger were cooked just perfect on the inside and also had a perfect crispness on the outside
As far as value, the menu has no astronomical prices
What a bargain - for $15
00, you can a sit at Talias outdoor caf and enjoy a juicy hamburger with substantial amount of fries and salad
For desert We had the chocolate souffl and banana tart and both were great
The staff was very friendly
Overall my dinning experience at Talias was excellent and I highly recommend it
One early evening we were walking in the neighborhood with my girlfriend, and we decided to give Talia's a try
It was early (5
30 or 6pm) and it wasn't very croweded and it looked pleasant enough
However, the service was very poor
The waitor never gave us the specials menu (which they gave to a another couple who sat next to us 20 minutes later) and the service was very slow even for the basics (bread and water, for which we had to ask a couple of times)
The steak was really average and overcooked

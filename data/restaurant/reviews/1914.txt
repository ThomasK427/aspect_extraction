Love , Love this place maybe because its so close to us but probabaly more because the staff there is soo friendly and knowledgeable
The brunch is my favorite and their Soho Burrito with mole sauce is to die for! They had a great prefix too during restaurant week
Great selection of American wines for the wine enthusiast too
Not much is wrong with this place except I wish my favorites were always on the menu!
Love , LOVE this place
The brunch here is amazing! especially the Soho Burrito with Mole sauce that they have
We went for restaurant week and the food was amazing then as well
The salmon is great just right not over cooked
The staff is very friendly and knowlegable
Definetly one of my favorite spots!
When I eat out I never order wine by the glass because the selection usually leaves a lot to be desired
Although a few nights ago at Zoe I was suprised to find some very interesting, fun and hard to find wine by the glass
The food was great too! It is restaurant week at Zoe and they do a three course dinner that is fantastic
I had prawns with a great corn salsa that the waiter paired with a chardonnay
Then I ate an amazingly tender veal flank steak paired with a great zin
The deserts were yummy and not too over the top
The meal didn't dent my wallet and I appreciate that
Keep up the good work Zoe!
I ate at Zoe during restaurant week and I was very disappointed
I ate at Zoe a few years ago and the food was excellent and the service was great
Last night was a total 360 from my previous experience
We waited a very long time for every part of our meal from salad to desert and it was not busy at all
On one of the hottest days of the summer they had the a/c on very low, it was hot in the restaurant
The food was very mediocre
My sister had a pea ravioli that was just not good
The culinary decisions the chef made were not wise
The only good thing about the restaurant was the staff they were very friendly
I thought restaurant week would be a great introduction to a new restaurant that I would be able to frequent in the future
I will never return to Zoe and I will tell my friends about my experience at the restaurant
I have been meaning to go to zoe for years and finally had the opportunity to last night
My husband and I were plesantly surprised by a warm and attentive staff
I decided to try the restaurant week menu
The sheep's milk ricotta and tomato salad was inovative and well prepared
My flatiron steak that followed was cooked to perfection
Zoe also offered a three course wine pairing for $15 which was a steal
Overall I had a great time and will definitely be back to ZOE in the near future
I wish I hadn't waited so long in the first place!
I've been to Zoe for cocktails and an occasional pizza a million times but I'd never had dinner until last night
I popped in on my way home from work to grab a cold glass of wine and the bartender persuaded me to stay for dinner
I started with the most perfect heirloom tomato salad and went on to enjoy a fantastic skate as my entree
The sweet and savory components in the dish balenced perfectly
In addition to this, the service was great; super knowlagable and attentive yet totally fun
My entire experience was A+! I've found my new favorite restaraunt
Zoe restaurant has always been one of my favorite places to take out-of-town guests for brunch
The service is on point, the food is fun and innovative, and it gives my out-of-town guests on opportunity to experience a truly great NYC restaurant
As a seasoned New Yorker, I have come to have very little respect for restaurant week
The menus offered are usually boring, cheap, and slopily assembled
don't get me started on service
After eating at Zoe during restaurant week, I was immediately reminded of the great things a restaurant should offer during restaurant week
Zoe offers a huge selection for their dinner prix fixe of high quality and innovative dishes
I started with mouthwatering ribs, then had a very generous steak that came with beautifully wilted spinach and crispy onion frites
The desserts were simple, straight forward, and fun, everything that is now hard to find in a sea of convoluted desserts
The night I went to Zoe, the restaurant was quite busy
Much to my satisfaction, I was seated promptly without a reservation and soon after being seated was greeted by my server
The server made great wine by the glass recommendations to pair with my three courses
What I found most impressive about the service was the server's comprehensive knowledge of both the wine list and menu
Zoe is a Soho must eat and has been for many years
As a proud New Yorker, I find comfort in the fact that reputable restaurants like Zoe still take pride in the food and service they provide, regardless of what time of year it is
I've been a regular at Zoe ever since I moved to the neighborhood 6 years ago
The food never ceases to amaze me
Even though the restaurant has changed executive chefs a few times throughout the years, it still manages to consistently produce the most delicious and eclectic plates it is most famous for
As a matter of fact, with each changing of the guard this place only seems to improve upon its already highly unique fare
I am very confused by the previous review from 7/14/06
This person obviously holds a grudge for an employee or owner (perhaps a disgruntled ex-boyfriend or girlfriend) with the sole intent of sabotaging a great establishment
Take it from a neighborhood local, you won't be disappointed with the food, service, or ambience at Zoe
As far as being offered a comp beverage or dessert: They have done this for me numerous times when trying out a new dish or when I have gone there for a special occasion
By the way, did I mention the Zoe has what is likely the best brunch in Manhattan? I take all my out of town guests here for Sunday brunch and they too leave with a feeling of utter bliss
I've heard many great reviews of this restaurant for a number of years
I finally ate here the other night, and while I was impressed by the overall attentive service, I was not impressed with the food
Perhaps other dishes are superior to those I ordered, however, the server confidently recommended the dishes I had
Also, it was 8-9pm on a thursday night, perhaps too early for dinner, but there wan't much ambiance going on
I ordered the skate, which was over-salted on the outside, and served over a bland melange of corn and 3 or 4 peas, that they call risotto
I also had the prawns appetizer, also served over a bland melange of corn , and I don't even remember what, clearly not so memorable, maybe the same thing they used under the skate
The Arneis glass of wine I had was very enjoyable, however, not to their credit
I decided not to send the skate back, as I really didn't want to wait for another entree to be prepared, however, I did inform the server, as well as the host
While the server offered nothing, the host apologized, and said that he hoped that I would return again, perhaps for brunch
Why would I want to return to a restaurant that erred in their food preparation, especially since I was not even offered anything to induce me to return? Perhaps a glass of wine of the house or a dessert (such a minimal cost to the house) would have persuaded me to return, but they will never know
Having worked in the food service business, it is quite amazing to me how such a simple, minimal-cost offer as a cocktail on the house in order to generate repeat business, is such an under-utilized strategy, which can be so effective
Again, not impressed
We were down from Boston on a recent shopping trip in Soho when we stumbled upon this gem
Not only was the food absolutely fanatstic but the ambience was very relaxing
The staff was incrediblly friendly and not snooty one bit
We are looking forward to coming back again and again
Our only regret is that we could only stay for dinner
I've heard that the Sunday brunch is to die for
This was our first experience at Zoe's
We plan on many more
A friendly staff, excellent food, and a fun place to sit at the bar and watch the food preparation
For a romantic evening you will probably prefer a table, but my husband and I love to cook so we enjoy sharing an evening with the Chef
From the atmosphere to the service, to the food, my entire experience at Zoe was incredible
The attention to detail was evident across the board
My meal was sensational-the food extremely flavorful as well as creative
The menu was full of interesting options and we couldn't have been happier savorinig every bite of our dinner and of course dessert
The staff at Zoe was also very professional and helpful in helping us pair our food perfectly with our wine
And you can't beat the open kitchen
Ok so if you like to go out to appreciate the ambience and not the food
This is an awesome restaurant! However, from start to finish the food failed to impress
The descriptions of the food just di not live up to the flavors
It will not be a restaurant I go to again
From the moment my friends and I walked into Zoe, we were overwhelmed by the architecture, the wonderful smells drifting from the open kitchen, and the friendly smile that greeted us at the door

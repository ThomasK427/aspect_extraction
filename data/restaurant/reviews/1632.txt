A New Yorker of European origin, I have had nothing but bad attitude from the staff of this restaurant on the two or three occasions I have met up with friends here
The worst occasion, and the final straw for me was when myself and four friends were told that we could have a table if we moved away from our stools at the bar
We were directed to a table by a member of staff, which we were then informed was reserved, and lost our seats at the bar, all this after spending upwards of $30 each on very expensive drinks over a two-hour period
When we complained about losing our seats, we were told 'get out if you don't like it, there are plenty of people who want to spend their money here, we don't need yours'
Nice
There's a great little bar two doors down!
What restaurant can claim to be Ukrainian if salo, venegret or olivier do not appear on the menu? With the exception of vareniki, bline, borsht, and golubtsi (stuffed cabage leaves) the Ukrainian East Village Restaurant was nothing more than your average New York deli/diner
But even those dishes, just like the restaurant, were Ukrainian in name only- the borsht was sweet and the bline (blitzes) were fried, southern style
It may not look like it but this is a step up from your average low quality takeout
They cook thing to your specifications (little oil, etc
)
Better than average cheep Chinese take out
The lunch specials are very low priced
All the regular items are just as good as you would expect but they have this one item that I have not seen at any other Chinese Restaurant
Its called Apple Chicken
Its a little like sesame chicken but has more fruit flavor sweetness
In addition apple chunks are cooked in with sauce until they become soft
A very nice touch
Worth trying
searched everywhere for all you can eat sushi which is very hard to find in nyc
okura's great bc not only is it $20 all you can eat but the sushi is great
also the staff is really friendly and you cant beat the prices
I have noticed many Indian restaurants come and go but mitali has been around for long as I can remember, I have been going to this place since I was a small kid with my parents, the food is always reliable and great, and the staff helpful on most but not all visits
My husband and I had a late lunch here today
Service was abrupt and rather rude, as if they really didn't want us around even though there were only 3 other tables occupied besides ours
The food - chicken biriyani, mixed veg curry and naan - was presentable but hardly fantastic
The rice didn't taste at all fresh
Overall our experience was nowhere close to what we had been expecting from the restaurant's rave reviews
I don't like Indian food but I love Mitali
I have never had a dish I didn't at least like if not love
They do the most magical things with chicken
Even their rice is better than any other restaurant
The coconut soup is delicious and for people with delicate stomachs like mine, they cater to special diets
Wonderful place and it crowds up fast so make reservations
I love Indian food
but Mitali east is in a class of it's own
The charming atmosphere, the amazingly polite and accommodating waiters, and the food (which I am always craving) makes this small Indian place my favorite eatery in New York
Having been a fan of Mitali for the last five years I strongly recommend their Chicken Milai and mango ice cream
But really with that menu, you can't go wrong
Now if only they had a low carb section
We love Mitali East, and we look forward to the re-opening of Mitali West
However, Mitali East has consistently great food, very attentive service and great bang for your dining buck
The Chicken Tikka is a strong staple, but do not be afraid to go for more exotic dishes as they do not disappoint
We also love their extensive wine menu
I eat at Mitali frequently and it is consistently good
The service is always quick, and Mitali is inexpensive
This is our favorite Indian restaurant in NY or any other city
Great atmosphere, great service, awesome food
This is definitely my favorite Indian restaurant in New York City, no question
Other than some shady service, the food was incredible, the ambience was nice, and it was a great place to go with the big group of friends I was chillin' with that night
This is definitely the best of the E
6th St
Indian restaurants
The food and ambience are several notches above its neighbors
The menu presents the usual greatest hits of Indian cuisine, and the naan is particularly good
(There's a window into the kitchen showing the chefs working busily away in front of the Tandoori oven
) If you don't feel like springing for the even-better Haveli around the corner (which is apparently owned by the same people) this is the perfect compromise
i came up from Forida and my relatives insisted that i must go to patsys before my trip was up
Not only was the food outstanding, but the service and atmosphere was rocking
they played cool music and their waitstaff had a delightful charm to them
the pizza is fantastic and the pasta is beyond imagination, and i cant even begin the explain the to tell you how great the cannoli was
if you want a good time and good food, i would defintly recommend that you try this place out!!!
I was appalled by the unprofessional and rude service
We had 5 people
The waitstaff seated us at an uncomfortable table blocked by a ledge
There were other available group tables but they refused to transfer us
The restaurant was half empty so couldn't understand why they were being so unaccommodating
We sat down 20 min
- No waitstaff came to serve us, no menus were given
Needless to say, we did not want to stay
I explained to the waiters we were leaving due to bad service
The waiters just laughed outloud at my comment which disgusted me
Waiters were disrespectful and rude
Patsy's really needs to hire a new waitstaff
The waiters lacked even the simplest manners
This is the first time I'm writing a restaurant review- only because I'm so compelled to warn people- stay away from Patsy's Pizzeria! unless you want a bad experience
I attempted to have my birthday dinner here last night
I was appalled at how unaccomodating the hostess was
My friend and I arrived 20 minutes early to let her know that a large group was coming (they do not take reservations)
Two minutes before the arranged time, she pointed out two empty tables to accomodate the group
Two minutes after the arranged time, she gave the tables away as ONE of the party was running late
She informed people waiting by the bar that they could only stand there if they were going to buy a drink, and otherwise should wait outside
Ten minutes later, three people came in and were ADDED to a large party that was already seated
The hostess could not explain how this could happen under their full-party policy
We left and had a great dinner across the street at El Cantinero
The food here is good; however, for the cost one can find much better deals out there
I enjoyed both the pizza and the pasta dish that I ordered, but I felt the food was overpriced
The service was average in quality, and the decor is nothing special either
Also, the restaurant was a bit too crowded and loud, so if you like to dine out in a place that is a bit more quiet, then this place is not for you
I really like this pizzeria and go here often, especially since it's near where I live
They have great thin crust pizza and most of their pasta dishes are good
My friends recommend the rigatoni alla vodka
I especially like their olive oil
I recommend coming here with a big group if you're in the mood for Italian
I am having a tought time deciding which is my fav
Patsy's, Grimaldi's or Lombardi's
This week, it's Patsy's
I would highly reccomend Extra Cheese and any of the Salads
I am not a big fan of their pasta's though
I would also give Nick's Pizza a try

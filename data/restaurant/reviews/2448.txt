If you get annoyed by obnoxious people, you're better off dining elsewhere
I think we waited about 15 minutes for water
Also, we didn't even seem to have a waiter for 30 mins despite having to get up and ask the maitre'd for some service! Then the food took another 40 mins
While this place has a diverse menu and is reliable for an easy inepensive meal, the service ruins it
We've tried this place a few times because it always looks busy so we thought maybe we just had bad luck
After the third time, we realized it wasn't us
The food is bad and inconsistent
You will order the same thing as someone across from you but yours may be missing a significant side that should accompany it (happened twice) or try something one night and it's okay, the next time it's terrible
Service was rude as well
I don't know how the place used to be but it's bad now
City Grill is a great place on the UWS that could appeal to everyone in your group
The menu has good standards, but also more interesting fare and specials, which should appeal to everyone from the burger crowd to the food snob
Service can be spotty sometimes, but that can happen anywhere
The wine list is also very reasonably priced
If you want a reliable UWS neighborhood restaurant, the City Grill is it
We had lunch at City Grill on Saturday, and it was delicious
My husband had the Oriental Chicken Salad, which was fabulously addictive, and gigantic
We both kept eating it long after we were full
My Western omelette was more like a frittata, chock full of ingredients, and I loved it
Service was very attentive this time, an improvement over our last visit
Walking around the westside this restaurant looked promising
Looks can be deceiving
The waiter seemed truly disinterested (he forgot to bring the bread basket and the wine was served after he delivered the entrees
The rolls -- one of which was truly a sour dough were tasteless
I ordered one of the specials-- barbecue chicken-- which had to be sent back to the kitchen because it was served uncooked
Did not bother to stay for dessert
Honestly, I suggest you don't stay for the main course either
City Grill used to be my neighborhood favorite- to eat out at and order in from
The management and chef must have changed (even though the wait service says no)
The last time I got a salad, I got taco garnishing for lettuce! And the turkey dinner was 100% fat, no meat!
Three of us went to the City Grill last night and first the not so pleasant
It took nearly 15 minutes for a waiter to acknowledge us
We had to complain to management before we could get service
Once we got our waiter, the service was horrible
The food on the other hand was straight forward good and won't break the bank
Went there last week
Great fresh, hot food
Great presentation for the price
Good selection of dishes
Attentive staff, that didn't hassle
Good value
Some really nice entree's for $10 - $12
Good portions
Comforting decor and bar
Good neighbourhood vibe
Pleased all-round and going back tonight!
Visiting the Upper West side frequently, this restaurant quickly turned out to be a place we loved to go to
The menu was excellent, always with delicious specials, good prices and excellent service
Then new management took over; the menus changed, new cooks, and this place went from top notch to rock bottom
After our last and final visit, we received cold food and greasy veggies from what must be a novice cook
Although the staff is always super friendly, its a shame what has happened to this place!
My boyfriend and I dined here recently, and I absolutely loved the food! I ordered a grilled breast of chicken with mashed potatoes, and I couldn't get enough! My boyfriend had steak and his was very nice too
Serivce was pretty good, friendly waitress
Had to wait a little for a table, but it was only a few minutes wait
Overall, a good atmosphere and good prices
This restaurant has a nice relaxed feel to it late at night
We went there one night after the ballet and it was nice to sit in the air-conditioned sidewalk section
Better than average burger and fries
There was a slightly annoying host but he settled down
The waitress was sleepy but accomodating
I went here yesterday night with my best friend for the first time
We were sitted promptly and our waiter was very attentive
Our water glass was never half empty, answered all our questions, and came by many times to see if we needed anything
The menu had many selections for appetizers, salads, pastas, and main courses
I enjoyed the food very much and the portion was just right, not too small
My friend liked the music they were playing
I would definitely return
have been to the place a couple of times
Like it a lot
excellent burgers
delicious chicken dishes and inviting bread loaves
reasonably diverse menu
very down to earth
not too crowded
reasonable service
excellent neighborhood restaurant
glad i found it
there are not many such places in this area
if this is the night you want, this is your destination
low maintenance, good food, pitchers

a favorite for after work mingling with munchies
This is the place to go after a long day in the office and you want to hang out with friends or office-mates
Enjoy the cold beer and order a bacon-cheese burger (the chili burger is a bit sloppy, but delish!) You can't got wrong, unless you order one of their pasta dishes
stick with burgers and chicken and you will be ready for another day in the office
Happened upon All State Cafe after a long day of shopping
What a cozy spot! Lots of good beer on tap, good specials menu selection, many regulars
Our waiter was a bit of a flake case - he forgot about us several times
Unfortunately, prices were in accordance with the Upper West Side
I will try it again, but not with the same waiter! On the whole, I'm jealous of all the regulars
I don't mind the added gratuity *EXCEPT* that they quietly continue to include *another* blank field for tip on the credit slip without mentioning that it's already been added
Shame
Second: Called ahead for a reservation - nobody answered the phone during open hours after many tries
Since their website's down I began to wonder if they'd closed
Obviously not
The place was nearly empty, but they chose to seat us at a table with a shelf overhanging the table
We just moved the table away from the wall, but in a full house we would have been stuck
And, every time I've ever come here or Mekka, the service was very slow
All that aside, I love the food here and miss the old MEKKA on the LES
Best dishes here are the Soul Roll, Shrimp Etoufee, and the best Mac n' Cheese I've ever had in the city

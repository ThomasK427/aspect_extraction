Worth the trip from Manhattan
My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon
The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions
You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice
After reading the posts, I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow, despite living in Park Slope
But on a lazy Saturday night, we ended up going
Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather
The apps were good, a little pricey for 1/2 dozen oysters ($15)
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish
It was huge, delicious, fresh, and will be the reason we return
Hopefully next time, I will save room for dessert
I had the prix fixe Monday dinner special and it was terrible
Dinner went wrong starting with the appetizer
The oysters with lime and radish were barely chilled with a pronounced fishy taste
Then the surf and turf arrived
The half lobster tail was tiny, the meat overcooked and stringy, and when I cracked open the claw, all that emerged was white foam
The turf portion consisted of 4 small medallions of slightly tough meat
The best part was the nice portion of mashed potato with olives
The Minnow was a huge disappointment; I won't be going back
I'd chalk it up to a bad night in the kitchen, but the ingredients AND the execution were not so fresh
really cute space
kind of hidden amidst the brownstones
nice lighting and the menu changes often with new surprises
the staff is really friendly and the chef always comes out to ask how your food is
great place to take your special someone
This is the best fish in Brooklyn, and one of the tops in all NYC
The skate in brown butter is the best in the city
Don't listen to the naysayers, service is very professional
Best of all it is a great deal! Go often!
The food was good, but nothing great
I don't think the price (around $80 for 2 ppl, each getting one drink, one appetizer, one entree) is justified for the quality, however
I shoulda gone to the italnian restaurants a few blocks down in Park Slope
i can't say enough great things about the minnow
the food is outstanding, the prices are reasonable (for what you get, VERY much so), and the staff are some of the nicest, friendliest, most accommodating people i have met
after eating here once, the chef recognized us and made sure to greet us
truly a place where you feel taken care of
Yummy! Good food all round
Risotto was scrumptious, and I heard nothing but raves about the salmon
Stick with the seafood though - the steak was dry and underwhelming
Don't be put off by the screw top, the house red is highly recommended
Our experience here was great
I ordered an exotic fish that was served so creatively I quickly got over the fact it was served whole
The wine list was pretty substantial and as for the menu, they were very insipring with their organic influences, but I would try and stick to the fish because it really seems to be their their specialty
Top notch for creativity and ambiance--very relaxing experience
I love the minnow
Servers are very knowledgeable and enthusiastic
Hostess is always friendly and helpful
The food is great! The prices are greater! Great deal for the kind of food this little gem serves up
I usually start with an absolutely perfect cosmo made by a nortonesque bartender
Then move to my little cozy table and begin with whatever the special is and end with a delightful scoop of avalanche ice cream or sorbet
The only thing
they could use some new artwork
I've eaten here a bunch of times never been dissapointed
The fish as always ultra fresh the dishes well thought out
My only complaint is now its getting more popular there is normally a wait
I've eaten twice at this restaurant and have been very pleased both times
All of the fish is excellent, fresh and simply prepared
The staff is extremely gracious and courteous (am I the only one who thinks the bartender looks like Ed Norton?)
The room is lovely (as is the back patio)
I have particularly liked the Crispy Shrimp Cocktail one the regular menu, and I had the special whole roasted Branzini on my last trip, which was phenomenal
some of the best service I have ever had
One waiter, in particular, gave new meaning to New York dining
Thank you tall, blue-eyed bundle of joy
You were #1!!!!
The food was mediocre but the weirdest thing happened while we were having dinner
There was a lull in the conversation around the dining room and all of a sudden you could hear the chef in the back cursing and yelling at his staff
How embarrassing!
What a beautiful little restaurant
I am so glad you have come to Park Slope
Had a very romantic, lovely dinner on a Friday night, beautiful bottle of wine and amazing appetizers and food (I had the salmon)
However, don't recommend the scallops: while they were delicious, very paltry serving, only disappointment of the evening)
Great service too!
Everytime I go, I have the same thing - crispy shrimp w/ noice spicy cocktail sauce, followed by the seared tuna
The basil or rosemary potatoes rock - no question
The chef is a mellow guy who whips up some great stuff
Check it out!!!
We attended the crab fest which had been lushly described in the New York Post, but the reality was on the other end of the spectrum
A warning bell should have gone off when they asked us to pay up-front for the meal
Upon seeing the shabby set-up, we knew we had been snookered
There was no appetizer or dessert offered, as mentioned in the paper, and the crabs were suffering from an eating disorder, leaving us famished after the meal
Our waiter was indifferent with us, and the hostess in particular was short and snippy when speaking to us, and rolling her eyes and sighing heavily when she thought we weren't looking (or maybe she just didn't care)
Thumbs down for this joint!
The Scene Under black-and-white blow-ups of film stars like Marilyn Monroe and David Niven, young professionals settle into this film noir-ish spot--more during lunch time than dinner, though the bar attracts an after-work pack blowing off office steam over inexpensive bottles of wine
Service is very efficient and practical
The Food The variety of simple, serviceable dishes--sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, salads and more--keeps regulars coming back
The kitchen succeeds in producing elementary yet flavorful fare, like penne rustica minimally adorned with fresh tomatoes, basil and dried ricotta; a surprisingly light and lemony asparagus risotto; warm, pressed roast beef on focaccia; and thinly pounded veal sparingly dressed with piccata sauce
Those in the know look forward to the popular packaged desserts by Bindi, especially the fruit sorbets served in matching rinds
Great Food, Great wine, Great Service; nothing is missing
My wife and I have become regulars, we dine in twice a week A Lasagna is the best i ever had Worthed every penny you pay and nick the manager is the best
Nothing to say you have to go there and ask for risotto seafood and if you like to have a drink from the bar o my god ask for cosmapolitan the best ever
I took friends from out of town here for a quick dinner on a Saturday night
There was a huge party there, but we still had great service
The food was good and cheap! If you don't want to break the bank, this is a good place to go and the menu has a lot of favorites
ive been here a few times for lunch and the food isnt great
they used to have grilled panini for under $9 at lunch which was great considering that its a sitdown restaurant with service, but i didnt see those options when i came here this week
the other day, i had the grilled tuna (~$16) which came grey and well-done (though i asked for rare) atop a pile of tasteless carrots and with a side of broccoli
some of my coworkers had the pastas (~$12) which they said was normal
the chicken cacciatore was pretty dry though it was in an oily sauce
i believe that desserts are outsourced to another bakery because the menu depicts pictures with the supplier name

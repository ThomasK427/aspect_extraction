CC is just right if you are looking for some lobster and some other crustaceans
The service is good considering the area you are in, the ambience is nothing great, but fits the establishment
CC continues to be expensive, and almost worht it
The stone crab was good (if you are a Northerner), but not really good if you've ever spent time down south
My guests were impressed, and the seared tuna looked really good
Apps were fantastic and the desert was good too
We waited FOREVER on Valentine's Day for our table because their hostess had lost our reservation BUT the food was worthy of the long wait anyway
Raw Oyster fans - this is the place for great West Coast oysters!
I love this place! The food is really good, the wait is never too long, the atmosphere is family friendly
Like any other restaurant on a busy Friday or Saturday night, this place gets packed! Unfortunately, it attracts large groups
I wish people who go out in large groups would plan better and try to reserve space somewhere that can accomodate them
Large groups tend to get unruly
Otherwise an enjoyable and affordable eatery
Took my parents here
The tables are a little high, and the bar stools you have to sit on, (if you sit at a high table) are a little uncomfortable
I would suggest asking for a booth
Good oysters
REALLY good chowder
I hate it when chowder has huge chunks of potatoe and is REALLY thick like gravy
This was not, good consistency
I'd definately go back
The salmon with horseradish was really good
Gor for the 14
95 rush lunch
We really had a good time
Don't bring friends who don't like seafood
Only three choices, 2 steaks, 1 roast chicken
Or eat salad all night
We finally convinced our waitress to ask the chef for a grilled chicken caesar
The popcorn shrimp was good but not the crab legs or the mixed raw bar
The crab puff pastry was a spinach puff pastry with tiny bits of crab
Only four of us had entrees while two shared appetizers, but the bill was high (2 bottles of so-so wine)
It will be awhile before I think about going back again
I should have tried harder to convince everyone to try Shaffer City since Zagat's says it beats this place hands down, but one couple from CA had their hearts set on this place
Oh well, so much for fond memories
I hate places that include the tip on the check, we usually pay exact amounts then
I live in the city and I was impressed by this place,I knew this as this place when it was Cafe Iguana
After going to 4 restaurant in the area on a busy Sat night we wanted good food and a table for two where we weren't smushed and we got it, a nice table upstairs which was actually cozy
Delicious stuffed mushrooms with crab though a small portion but the entrees more than made up for it
Grilled monkfish on shrimp risotto and shrimp stuffed with crab and not bad for $20
We'll be back
Good space for groups to eat
Not the greatest food but good enough
Lose the pretense and come to eat seafood
This restaurant located in gramercy has an excellent variety of entrees
The prices are reasonable for NY
We really enjoyed the raw oysters and fried calamari
A good selection of seafood that was fresh and delicious
The place is a bit too noisy, but worth a visit for the food
Try the delicious seafood at this place
We recommend the crabcakes and the raw bar can't be beat
We both liked the daily specials too
We are definitely going back
This is my favorite seafood in NYC
Great lobster and terrific crab legs
Check out the pre fix
It is awesome
The perfect meal; delux combo raw bar as an appetizer, King crab as your entree
Don't waste your time with the sides,( not because they aren't good, just why waste the room)
Freshest seafood place by far
One of the few places where i would feel safe eating on the half shell
Brilliant mix of selections
Great for elegant and romantic dinners
Service is excellent
I HAD DINNER HERE RECENTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED
THEY HAVE AN EXTENSIVE MENU WITH SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
THE FISH WAS FRESH, TASTED DELICIOUS AND THE PRICES WERE REASONABLE
THE SERVICE WAS GREAT - OUR SERVER WAS FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL
SAVE ROOM FOR THE MANGO SORBET - THE PERFECT FINISH TO AN ENJOYABLE DINNER!
We ate here the last night in NY
I was glad we picked the place
Service was great and the food was really, really good
We had Maryland crab cakes, seafood gumbo and stuffed shrimp
I was not disappointed at all
I can't understand anyone who thinks this food is only average
THIS PLACE IS SERVING THE FRESHEST FISH POSSIBLE
I WALK BY CITYCRAB EVERY MORNING AND WATCH THE CHEFS TAKE THE FISH DELIVERY FROM THE FULTON MARKET
I DO EAT HERE ONCE A WEEK AND ALWAYS ENJOY THE FOOD AND ATMOSPHERE
THE WAITERS ARE FRIENDLY AND ALWAYS CAN ANSWER MY QUESTIONS ON HOW EACH DISH IS PREPARED
THE SPECIALS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING AND THEY FEATURE FIAH FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD
OH ALSO IN LAST WEEKS DAILY NEWS THEY WERE RATED ONE OF THE CLEANEST IN THE NY AREA
Well, May 28th was my 34th birthday
I love seafood and so does my bestfriend
Crab City is where we decided to go
I had the twin lobster tails with mash potato and my friend had the crab legs
My lobster tails were small and for $31, please
I wasn't that impress
The food was okay nothing for me to jump out of my seat and call everyone to come and join me
But don't get me wrong I will probably stop by there again
The food is simple
Something I can do at home but instead I will go out and have them do it for me
The waitress well, she needs to brush up on her english
But overall it did it's purpose
actually, i didnt have dinner here, but the sangria wasnt half bad + the portobello quesadillas were sOooOoo good
id go there again just for that
GREAT food: this place has the best fish chips in town
Even my boyfriend, who is not an anglophile like me, found plenty of menu items to make him happy
GREAT drinks: they have Magner's Cider on tap and, for some reason, that makes it taste even better
FUN ATMOSPHERE: I dragged some out-of-town friends there and we had a great time
We got a table outside, drank and chatted to our heart's content

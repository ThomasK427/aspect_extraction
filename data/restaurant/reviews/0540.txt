Now, explain to me-- how is this cheap? I would call it average-priced!
This place is such a find!! My friends and I found it about 8 months ago, and have been in love ever since
The sushi is amazing-have yet to try something that I didnt like
The fact that its BYOB rocks!!! Poke is a rare find in the city!!!
Poke is our favorite Sushi Restaurant in the city! Lauren (the waitress) is awesome and so is DJ the sushi chef
The rolls melt in your mouth! Once you start going here you get hooked
The restaurant itself is small but the sushi makes up for it
And it's BYOB which makes it even better! This is by far my favorite restaurant in the city! I highly recommend :-)
Can't believe I haven't found this place earlier
Very small, but sushi is fresh fresh fresh
Rolls are even better
Not like Sushi of Gari which does the fushion type rolls
Here is back to basic, fresh sushi
Grilled mussels (appertizer) is a must
BYOB make it all the better
Place is small
Sit right next to kitchen area did stink up my clothes
Wait is long on weekends but so worth it
Let's hope more people don't discover it
The food here is great, and the sushi especially good
Poke is inexpensive considering the quality of the food
BYOB is a nice feature
It sometimes takes a while to get seated since the place is so small, but once you're inside the food makes you forget all about the wait
Service is friendly, but somewhat slow
The restaurant does not take reservations
Poke is great sushi, and it's BYOB, which is a rare find in NYC
However, what is the deal with the smell coming from the frier? It took FOREVER last time for the smell of fried (tempura, I'm guessing) to get out of my coat and my clothes
They need to ventilate! Othat than that, Poke is excellent
If you want great sushi in a relaxed and casual environment, this is the place
I eat at Poke at least once a week and I cant stop
I always crave more! Beware of the long wait for your food if the restaurant is busy; however, it's worth the wait
This sushi restaurant was a real find! Their special sushi rolls were really amazing
BJ, the sushi chef, does amazing things with fish
But I woulld recommend coming with enough time, since BJ is the only chef, it takes a liitle while to get served
My husband and I went to Rosy's after reading the reviews posted here
I was really disappointed in the whole experience
For the price of an entree you would not expect to be served frozen steak fries
We could have gone to McDonald's for frozen fries
For dinner I had the crab cakes and my husband had the fisherman's platter
My crab cakes were over seasoned and my husband's meal was average, he is the one who got the frozen fries and that was enough to ruin the meal for me
The other BIG turn off for me was how close the tables were
We were about 3 inches (I'm serious) from the next table
If I wanted to eat with strangers I would have went to a Japanese steak house
Our bill was about $120 and I wish I had spent it somewhere else
Went to this place before a Broadway show with my boyfriend and parents
We had reservations and were seated immediately, got a nice table by the window
The food was good, service was good, restaurant was good
My problem with this place was that it was simply good, it wasnt fantastic or great, there was nothing special about this place
The bill was $140
00 for 4 people with drinks
We had recently had very bad service at another restaraunt in Times Square so when we visited Rosie's we were hoping for a better experience
We were sat promptly and our server was excellent
He had even lived in the state we are from!! Definitely visit this restaraunt
Thanks Winston!!!!
We ran across this place purely by accident
Great food, great service, and great atmosphere
I would reccomend it for lunch, very good deal
I enjoyed this restaurant a lot
The booths were comfortable and intimate, and the overall ambience was casually sophisticated, if perhaps a bit loud
The waitstaff was top-notch, attentive and willing to give in-depth descriptions of menu items and tailored recommendations
Side dishes are ordered separately, but are large enough to share
I'd recommend the perfectly-cooked meat dishes over the somewhat mundane shepherd's pie
Dessert is a must, and the selection of after-dinner whiskeys is excellent
Rosie has wonderful service, atmosphere, and food
The place was very romantic, I loved it and we'll definitely go back soon
I ordered the salmon and it was cooked to perfection as they say
The servers were on top of things as expected
Restaurant is large, some tables a little cramped
I loved the tuna, my guests were not to pleased with their shrimp dish
skip the cheesecake, but the chocolate brownie with hot chocolate mousse and banana ice cream is wonderful
super service and a very friendly bar
Rosie's is one of the best undiscovered resturants, in the midle of Times Square
This resturant run by owner Joe and Chef Billy is a home away from home
they will treat you like family as the fill your bellies
Go -- enjoy
I had dinner at Rosie O'Grady's in Time Square this past weekend and found the food to be absolutle mouth-watering
Compliments to the Chef
Decor is soft with lots of natural rustic earth tones, with hints of amber
The staff were very friendly and efficient
Also they have a wonderful pre-fix menu for theater goers, and the have a private room called the LongAcre Room
I found the whole dining experiece from the beginning to finish just outstanding
Enjoyed every moment of it, and would highly recommend it
Well-run, nicely decorated interior serving first rate steaks, seafood, etc
A must see if you are in the Times Square area
Also great for drinks, beautiful bar and fireplace
We went to this spot last minute and were pleasantly suprised
The food was inexpensive and pretty good
I can't understand how this restaurant has a high rating
maybe due to the fact that there are NO GOOD Mexican restaurants this side of California, especially not in the upper east side of Manhattan
Still, the food is way below average
My experience with pick up/delivery was particularly awful
I'm vegetarian; I ordered a vegetarian burrito for pick up
By the time I got home with it, I was starving
But it wasn't vegetarian, it was a chicken burrito
I called and asked the restaurant to send what I'd ordered, reiterating vegetarian burrito
A half hour later, I received a burrito with vegetables, along with an unidentifiable meat, perhaps pork or beef
I called and told them I was disappointed and not to send any more food
This was such an incredibly bad experience I was moved to waste more time (while I'm still starving) and write this review
I've been searching for a couple of decades for Mexican food as good as this, and I believe I've found it here
Outstanding mole, tamales, enchiladas - it's all authentically done with rich flavors, not just the hot stuff one comes to expect from the average Mexican restaurant

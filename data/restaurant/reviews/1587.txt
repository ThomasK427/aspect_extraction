The entrees fall a little short of the bar that the arepas set, but I suspect that is in good part because the arepas set a very high standard, indeed
The tostones are perfectly made--not greasy at all--and the empanadas are pretty decent
They're made out of corn flour and very much better than the wheat variety that's more the standard in NYC
At some point, I intend to go back and try everything on the menu--especially the ceviches
Nothing at all wrong with the service that I noticed: the man and the woman were both very pleasant
This place is small, but the food is tasty
Been there on a few occasions and I will keep going
You do not go to this place for their service
If you luck out and get the female waitress then expect smile, the male waiter needs to lose the attitude
Try the batidas (smoothies)
Expect to wait outside until a table clears
What's the big fuss about? THe food is good, but I've had better arepas
Service was rushed and somewhat rude, but they can get overwhelmed I suppose
One of the best restaurants I've been to in terms of value (think between the two of us it was less than $50 and we had drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees)
The food is great - tantalizing spices and Latin flavors - a must try
Service was fast and the atmosphere is down to earth
Decor - kitschy, but not too loud and a bit fun
Highly reco it
the food at this humble bastion of venezuelan home cooking is delicious-AND-authentic (how does this place rate only a 19 in zagat's? 23 would be more accurate), portions are huge, and prices are quite reasonable--inexpensive, really, by manhattan standards
only problem is that the place is tiny--you gotta get there early to get a good table
and don't think of coming with a big group
service is efficient, and in spite of its diminutive size, the space is sunny, welcoming, and clean
recommended dishes: tuna/avocado arepa, carne asada arepa/empanada, chupe soup, shrimp dish (forgot the name, but you get TONS of jumbo shrimp), yuca, fresh fruit juices
sometimes i've just ordered arepas and empanadas for my meal; other times, i've split a dinner entree and an appetizer with a friend and been satisfied, since the portions are so huge
a great place all-around--i'd highly recommend it for a casual first date
In Short The restaurant portion of Three of Cups has a comfy, rustic-farmhouse feel, making it an apt spot for consuming the house specialties: personalized pizzas and creative pastas
The lowkey bar downstairs (known as Lounge) is a requisate stop with East Village imbibers
With its thrift store couches, familiar tapestries, and low light, it has a basement rec-room appeal
My friends and I have been there twice now
The pizza is out of this world, the pasta dishes are amazing
Even the salads are yummy! You get a very good portion for the prices
The only bad thing is, the service is horrible! We practically had to get up and flag someone down
The second time we went the waiter didn't put in our pizza order! They brought us the wrong food first and then our dinner came
You'll go thirsty trying to get a drink! But if you can put up with the bad service the food is worth the wait! The bar was great, and service there was amazing!!
first time here and very impressed - sangria was great, bread was awesome, food was fantastic - i wish i could have finished my plate it was that good!
Three of Cups is not just a pizza place
Although whenever I go I tend to order at least one small pie, the place has great dishes all around
Try some of their specials, you'll always be in for a treat
And their salads are some of the most interesting ones in Manhattan
But the pizza--I would die without it every week or two
Three of Cups: My favorite restaurant in New York
It's unique ambience is worth dining in once, but the food wasn't up to par
There are too many great Italian restaurants in nyc
The staff were friendly, but the food just wasn't that great
We were a party of 5
food was great
service was prompt and dessert was awesome
so was the beer on tap
Anthony, the owner, was a pleasure and made us feel so at home
my daughter lives a block away and we will be back for sure
I live on Staten Island and travel to the East Village every week just to eat in Three of Cups
We have been comming to this restaurant for five years and plan to continue
I have eaten in many places throughout Italy and believe me, this is as good
The food here is spectacular
It is fresh and well prepared
The service is friendly and cheerful
The owner, Anthony, welcomes everyone with a smile and a conversation
He makes sure your well taken care of
He goes out of his way to make sure you are happy
Many of the patrons are on a first name bases with there servers
Well prepared food, from the pizzas to the fish
I recommend EVERYTHING! Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, including the excellent wine list
Now you know why I travel from Staten Island and pay two tolls
Its worth the trip
This place has a rare and unique east village feel, with a menu that is above average for that area
I had been before and my last visit was excellent
This time compelled me to write a review; I met 6 friends there and we realized that none of us had made our dinner arrangements
The owner was there and agreed to squeeze us in, and it took about 20 minutes to get a table pretty nice of them considering it was a weekend night
On top of that, their pasta is great! I had the Rigatoni Cosa Nostra with plum tomatoes, a really nice sauce with zucchini and eggplant
This place is a true gem of that area, with few places in the area like it of that quality
It turns out they had a DJ downstairs with a truly authentic rock and roll dcora lot of fun
Book a table of 7 based on recommendations and reviews
Overall experience was terrible
Appetizers took almost 45 minutes to arrive, and we didn't even get any bread until someone from our table physically got up to track down someone
Entrees were also slow to arrive
We were told the kitchen was really busy, even though the restaurant was half empty
Each dish was either too salty, too oily, too much garlic, or needlessly spicy
We asked to speak with the manager and politely told him how disappointed we were with the service and food
A simple apology and perhaps some type of compensation would have been the proper way to resolve the situation
Instead, the manager became extremely defensive, very rude, and started arguing with us
We were all shocked by how awful the manager treated our group
It was by far our worst dining experience in NYC
Decor is really cute and everything you'd expect of a quaint restaurant on the LES
The restaurant is packed however, food is average and service is average
Other people must have had great experiences but I have to say that mine was lacking
This has been one of my favorites italian restaurants for several years
It's affordable, they are great with accomodating larger groups, the service is good, and the food is always fantastic
Long time since I've been to this place and although the staff has moved on the pizza rocked as always (maybe the best in the city) and boroughs
Haven't tasted all but cannot imagine what pizza could be better
Had the baked clams and the chicken milanese
some Sicilian Red wine which was affordable and quite good
This place is very relaxed and unpretentious I'm planning a Pizza party in March for a friend coming in from California where pizza, pitchers's of beer and sangria will be enjoyed by all
Oh and if can get a booth your kings and queens of New york cubbie
I've been to Three Of Cups many times
While the ambiance is lovely, the food excellent, and the prices reasonable, my last experience at the place turned me away forever
Throughout the meal, I noticed the owner verbally abusing a couple of the busboys, in front of us customers
At the end of a multi-course meal with alcohol (read: $$$), the waiter asked us to leave the table not more than two minutes after we paid the check! When we complained to the owner, he gave a ton of attitude and was incredibly insulting and patronizing
This is a great restaurant, but I can't give my money to a jerk like him
The pizzas came in quickly after we ordered
It was fresh

I have litereally had dreams about Auroras
Ive been three times, twice for dinner and once for brunch
Their brunch was delicious and very affordable but nothing too crazy
Pretty classic brunch menu
Dinner, however, is a different story
The homemade pastas, especially the ravioli with orange powder and the orrichetti with Wild Boar Sausage, are just ridiculously delicious
A salad I tried with riccotta, candied nuts, spinach and watermelon, has literally popped up in my dreams it was so good
During the summer, seating in the garden is prime
An herb garden where you actually see the chefs cutting from, is charming
Great addition to Willliamsburgs score of dining
If I remember correctly, make sure you bring cash, they dont take cards!
absolutely a gem, it's worth the trip from manhattan, food is incredible
I went here on a date and the experience was wonderful
Candlelit tables, efficient service, delicious food and very affordable
The pastas and seafood shine, and the desserts will absolutely blow your mind
Very highly recommended
A note: go early, or on weekdays
When we arrived, the place was practically empty -- within 20 minutes every table was full
Went there w/ reservations for 6 and was promptly seated
Nothing too special about the atmosphere, but it was warm and inviting with a charm all its own
Through the darkness, you could see a large bay window which showed the moonlit outdoor garden which instantly made me want to revisit this place in the summer
The food was fabulous (we ordered many appetizers and many different entrees and shared it all; none disappointed) and the value was quite nice
Crowd was sophisticated and probably a bit more mature (read: old) than most other places in the neighbourhood, but that's not a problem
Service was attentive without being overbearing - fun, even
At the end, we were served complimentary shots of limoncella which was a delicious and esophagus warming way to head out into the cold night
This has to be the best new restaurant in Williamsburg
Truly wonderful food in a beautiful space with nice service
And just off the beaten path enough to escape the hipsters- the crowd was low-key and sophisticated
We'll definitely be back
Amazing italian food served by a warm and friendly staff! It seems that lately much of Williamsburg has fallen victim to a cooler than thou attitide
That makes the arrival of Aurora that much more of a blessing!!!
the coffee - hot, iced, espresso - is among the best in the city, by far
definitely THE BEST on the lower east side
plus, the staff are all friendly, efficient, and know what they're doing
Great place for coffee
Great food
Awsome sandwiches
You can read the Times while sipping your coffee
Awesome coffee, nice teas, sandwiches and pastries
Very comfortable spot with magazines, artwork, plenty of seating so that you can linger as long as you want
And they got wireless internet
The staff is friendly, hip and unpretentious
Great addition to the neighborhood!
A good, solid, coffeeshop in an area that sorely needs it
Unlike Starbucks, the baristas are helpful and down to earth, and the fresh coffee always gives you that caffeine kick you need
Great to pop in, and great to hang out (the WiFi is free)
This will always be one of my favorite spots in the city
The service, the food, and the atmosphere are just perfect! My favorite place to sit is on the comfy floor mats with the low tables, if you go, insist to sit on the mats! its such a wonderful dining experience and they never make you feel rushed
youre welcome to sit as long as you like
It's excellent! The food is amazing and the ambiance is great
Afghan and Persian restaurants are often best known for their delicious kebabs and rice, and if that's your pleasure Bamiyan doesn't disappoint
What's special about this place, however, is that the menu is more extensive than most, with a variety of vegetarian dishes and delicious lentil-based stews
The ambience is warm, exotic, and comfortable
This place runs on Afghan time, so the service is leisurely, so make sure you are as well when you plan your visit
After looking at ratings, I thought that this would be a safe bet for a group of conservative 30-somethings to come celebrate a birthday with food and drinks
We actually had a good start to the evening, for about 2 hours
It was then alomost midnight and they closed the bar; it was a Saturday night! It wasn't a holiday, or anything special
The place still held about 80 people
What really bothered me was they they didn't even say - Last Call
Everyone was really upset
I was too and felt especially annoyed since I was the one who told my friends to come there
The owner, Fred, said that they were just closing early
Thanks Fred!  Perhaps he just had other things to do and needed to get out of there
Maybe he wasn't the owner
I'd recommend that us NYkers avoid this place
Grace is an unassuming spot on a shadowy stretch of Franklin St
But everything about the joint is great: the endless, burnished wooden bar that welcomes you upfront, the laid-back vibe and casual friendly service, and the top-notch small plate menu
Empanadas, spring rolls, pot stickers, crab cakes, tacos, tuna tartare, etc
, all well-prepared, satisfying fare that makes you think, who needs a main course, anyway? Reasonably priced wine list with smart choices, too
The food at Grace is unbelievable, from the bruschetta to the spring rolls to the skirt steak
And those are just the appetizers
The bar staff is barnone the best in the city--they remember you, they treat you right
Slip into the back room and the crowd at the bar disappears
The food is GREAT the banquets are large
Choose a bottle from the cheap wine list and kick back
Hidden Tribeca Gem
Berst BBQ sandwich, good drinks and the best selection of liquor in NY
The Scene Chalkboard walls listing wines and daily specials surround a small half-moon bar, two-top tables sit snugly next to an entire wall of windows, and orange banquettes and dim lighting throughout make for a stylish, sultry air
Spillover from the Meatpacking District and the West Village begets a Chelsea-boy and glamour-girl crowd
The Food Shareable Italian plates--assorted cured meats, antipasti and pastas--comprise most of the menu
Start with the house caponata--a spreadable onion, eggplant and sweet pepper dip that's a favorite and often sells out--and share a simple salad of fennel, arugula and Parmesan
Among pastas, the orrechiette with broccoli rabe and sausage is a better choice than the garganelli with too-scarce pieces of braised lamb
Entrees show careful preparation; both the buttery tuna loin over herb and olive oil-marinated white beans, and the soothing stew overflowing with fresh, tender seafood satisfy
Gosh, with all the lousy reviews and all the good restaurants in NY, who would bother? I was taken to dinner by two New York friends and, long story short, had mediocre food that was undersalted, plain and uninspired, AND had poor service
Our meal was capped of with the waiter rudely saying he needed the table for other customers
We arrived promptly at reservation time and were not lingering
Frankly, we couldn't believe it
I went to the restaurant with 11 friends and we had a wonderful experience
I would not recommend Bivio as a group friendly joint due to the size but the place handled our large group exceptionally well given the space constraints
Everyone commented on how good the food was and it came out lightening fast
We had a great time
We were the last table left and we were not rushed
Thank you Bivio
This restaurant is NOT FABULOUS
The space is great; cozy and charming
The food is a nightmare
The restaurant is incredibly NOT FABULOUS
The space and location are great
Trendy but cozy
A comfortable place to sit down and eat

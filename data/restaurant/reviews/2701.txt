Go early if you don't feel like hanging out for a bit
To make it this good you have to make it to order, so it's not fast food
They have a happening bar, a pool table and better than nod-to-the-neighborhood art to keep you busy
The Greens has consistently been one of my favorite restaurants since I moved to Brooklyn Heights
The food is always excellent and different
We take our out-of-town, vegetarian and kosher friends and relatives there, and they all love it
And whenever we see the bill, we are always surprised at how much good quality food we ate for such low price
I moved to Brooklyn after living in the city for years
The move left with less veggie options
Until one day, I stumbled upon a veggie chinese restaurant, Green's
This now became my favorite place to eat, at least 3-4 times a week
Also, converting several of my friends to this place
Except one day we ordered from home
Our bill was never under $50 (it's cheap there so we order a lot)
As we were about to devour all of our food, we stumbled upon a mealworm
It was extremely unappetizing
We called Green's to explain to them what happened and they didn't care
Only childish bantor and ridiculous phone calls and hanging up on us is the response we got
The details are way to long to get in to
So, my search for veggie food continues
I will NEVER eat there again
Plain rude I tell you!!!!
This place was recommended to me on a recent visit to NYC
I made a point to go to Brooklyn to visit the restaurant and I am glad that I did
The food was like visiting Mom's house and the service was a welcome change
The mac cheese is so creamy and greens are seasoned just right
I am recommending that everyone that I know that visits NYC goes to Ruthie's and I will be back
i received the warmest, most sincere and friendliest service - possibly ever! - in NYC
brooklyn and it's in habitants never cease to amaze me
after living in manhattan for the last 16 years, i wish i had come to brooklyn sooner
it's people like Ruthie that give this world charm
her food (she actually cooks it!) is fantastic down-home soul food served with love and a trip to fort greene without a stop at Ruthies would be a shame
excellent mac and cheese
Love this place
They have one of the best sushi in NYC
Prices are ok, which makes this place a great value
Staff is polite and pleasant
Food other than sushi is also very nice
They give wine and orange when you finish with food
Very pleasant place
Located in Brooklyn Heights, which is also a great location
Once we came there often, when the place was almost closed, they let us in and stayed until we finished (with no rush at all)
Reasonably priced sushi in the Heights
I've had my fair share of sushi, but I had never seen or had a Sweet Potato Roll before
While this may be among the least Japanese rolls ever, it was one of the tastiest
I'll be back
One of the best Japanese restaurant in the area
Great food
Friendly service
During the day, the sushi bar can be backed up a bit (thanks to their unbeatable lunch specials) so order early
good food, nice quiet place
Seems like they have different cook on the weekends because food taste much better thn
Bangkok chicken and their duck are great
Much better food thn most places on the block
This place has great food and it is a really pleasant place to eat
The service is really attentive and the place is really quiet and nice
Everyone should go there all the time
This is one of the best Thai places in NYC
The food does not only taste wonderful, it is also beautifully presented
Service is very good and all that for very little money
This place deserves much more attention than it has been getting so far
Excellent Thai food!  This place is neevr packed, you are always seated right away, the staff is very attentive and courteous, and the price is right
About $7-8 for a large dish of food
Try the Thai Iced Tea
OK, i have lived in Chicago, New York, and traveled all over the world and Sam's, by far, has the best Pizza hands down
Even if it is in Brooklyn  So why is it the best? Original old style smoked brick oven Family owned 50 years Heaped Fresh ingredients Mature dough  Fresh Italian cheese meat oil and preservatives in your pie  Also try their home made Italian cheese cake, it will make your jaws feel like they are going to melt
Be sure to ask Sam's son to whip you up a couple of Martinis with your Pie
Talk about extravagant, he has been making them since he was a wee lad
So, if you are looking for a quick slice or trendy atmosphere, go else where
However, if you want to, drink and enjoy the pleasures of food, Sam's is your new home away from home
I've had Gnocchi from the Bronx to Coney Island and this place is, hands down, the best
The potato gnocchi are like little moist pieces of velvet that melt in your mouth
No exaggeration
I've tried both the meat sauce and the veggie, and both are dee-lish
I have dreams about this gnocchi
Seriously! I'm seeing a therapist
Yes, the decor is what it is and all the better because some things just shouldn't change
The staff is helpful and funny and laid back and although they don't do home delivery, they do take call-in orders for pick up
This place is pure Brooklyn
I hope they never update
Walk downstairs and it is like stepping into a scene from the godfather
This place hasn't changed a bit in 50 years
tin ceilings and old phone booths along with the original booths combined with the best coal burning, brick oven pizza in the city
The chicken rollatine is to die for
The place ain't fancy but well worth the trip from any part of the city
When you're in the mood for classic red sauce Italian, this is a great place to go
We're not talking trendy, or chi chi, or at all pretentious
The decor is 1940s rec room, with Rhinegold on tap and lots of wood paneling
The service is wise cracking Brooklyn at its most classic
A video should be made of these guys before the accent and attitude are forever lost to history
Don't expect haut cuisine
just good value and a good time
Sam's is a great basic Italian restaurant, with friendly service, huge portions, and really good food
I would highly recommend it!
When we arrived the only waiter in the place told us to sit in the back and it would be 15 minutes
Since we already had a table we didn't really understand what 15 minutes meant
We found out that this meant 15 minutes until he would come back
He came back in 15 and we ordered a drinks and 2 pizzas
The drinks came out 30 minutes later
After 1 1/2 hours one of the pizzas came out

After sensing I was annoyed he was trying to make up by buying us several rounds of drinks
Won't go back again though
I would recommend to friends who want to have good steak but will warn them about strange service
Nebraska Beef deserves serious consideration as the best steakhouse in the City of New York
The food and the waitstaff never fail to disappoint
The Veal Chops are priceless, and their culinary artistry should be commended
When Nebraska says Petite Filet Mignon, they mean very petite
The steak was tasty, but not great
Home fries were coffee shop quality -- not typical steakhouse quality
Creamed spinach was luke warm and lacked flavor
This place is merely fair and has no ambience
Totally mediocre-- nothing great, nothing bad
Had very boring carmelized salmon, colleagues had the you have to try steak sandwich that didn't look anything special (who really eats a steak for lunch and gets anything done in the afternoon?)
Setting was dark and loud, service was adequate, bartenders were hot
Ho-hum, another financial district steakhouse priced to suit (pun) an expense account and a bland palate
I have now been coming to Nebraska for 3 years now since they started and the service coupled with the quality of beef is nothing but top grade
The reader who experienced the bad steak should know that Nebraska gets their meat from the same distributor as Peter Lugar's and Lansky's SO be careful of the meat comments, there is always one in a batch of many sometimes, too bad it was your time
My wife and son love the food, service and friendliness of Peter the owner
I must disagree with some of the previous reviews: by no means Nebraska serves a skimpy steak
In fact, the bone-in strip was one of the most intimidating steaks of its kind
Also, correct charring characterizes a properly cooked steak
One must understand that part of the art of preparing steaks is making certain it's charred correctly (Lugers is still having a problem with that issue)
No, they dont serve the best steak in NY, but its definitely in the big leagues
The steak (not ever comparable to whats sold in a grocery store) is Dry-Aged and cooked to specification (that includes charring)
The steak has a lot of what I look for, but it just didnt have big league flavor
The chili is the best Ive ever tasted
Ill go back just for that and the best Cheesecake Im yet to have in the city
If you like eating good steak, don't come here
Honestly, the first steak that I ordered (medium) was completely charred on the outside
I had to ask them to take it back and bring me another one
The one that they brought out (rare) was better, but there wasn't any kind of flavor to the meat
In addition, the meat was similar to the chuck meat that you can buy at the grocery stores (i've bought chuck before, and it's really the worst possible piece of meat that you can buy)
The chuck contains these fibers that you can't quite cut through
Thus, the bad filet with the and the okay service cost $30
You think it through
The atmosphere sucks as well
I'm reposting my anonymous review: Although half the interior is dedicated to the mahogany bar well stocked with various liquors, and well manned by beautiful bartenders, the real treat here is the food
From mutant-sized giant shrimp cocktail (three shrimp that together are about the size of a large lobster tail) to the delicious French onion soup to the filet mingon chili, Nebraska is a great place for lunch
For dinner, most (I simply haven't tried everything) entrees are excellent NY steakhouse fare
Go for the steak, their signature porterhouse, which Ill take over Mortons! Also, the best pork-chops I've had in Manhattan
All the sides, from the standard garlic mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and sauted mushrooms (a must) are perfect
The atmosphere is not so much an old-boy steakhouse but a new-boy steakhouse, being relaxed but sometimes a little too loud
In Short Dating back to the city and the nation's beginnings, the tavern was first opened in 1762 and was a favorite haunt of George Washington's
Today, the restaurant features numerous dining rooms named for historic visitors and war heroes, decorated with white linens and chandeliers
The traditional American menu offers meatloaf, steak, various sandwiches and salads and desserts such as creme brulee and pecan pie
I attended a rehearsal dinner at the Tavern towards the end of March 2006 in one of the private rooms
I was pleasantly surprised
The food, the service and the decor were all top notch
There is a very friendly and knowledgeable staff in regards to the rich history that the Tavern represents
I have been back twice and have not been disappointed
I would highly recommend trying it for your self
Whether it is a party of 2 or a party of 200
this is the place to have it
I just wish I lived closer
I would certainly become a regular
I went here late night with a friend and was surprised that they were still seating
The staff was kind and prompt and the food was great
I loved how historica everything was, from the seats, to the lamps, even the cultery had a flair for class
I throughly enjoyed my experience here
Fraunces Tavern is a terrific place to spoon and dine with the same fireplace the original G-Dubs set himself afront lit warmly in the spacious, elegant, aged oldest retaurant in New York City
Washington said goodbye to his troops here, but this is a great place for an unforgettable hello!  Enjoy the ale, and history!
Great ambiance, attentive and well-paced service with a European feel, and a menu filled with a variety of comfort food are the pluses here
Unfortunately, the food itself was just average at best
Appetizers, entrees and desserts suffered from a lack of variety in taste--all were nicely presented but none rose much above the level of something the average person could either cook for onesself or get at a well-run diner
The menu as a whole is overpriced considering the type and quality of food presented
On the whole, glad I went here, but wouldn't necessarily return or recommend to others
I am new to the city and found Fraunces by accident
I have been there with family from out of town and with my wife
Its tucked away and is a treasure in its own right! I have been there about 10 times and the food is fantastic along with the service
I have nothing negative to say about the place
The amazing history along with the food makes every dining experience perfect! I hate to tell others about the place because I want it to stay my own little dining get away
We usually only have one or two couples dining with us and the dining rooms are beautiful
I dont know what else to say
Go and see it
You will not be unsatisified! A
Michl (Staten Island)
Hundreds of years ago George Washington frequented Fraunces Tavern
Now you can too
While the second floor of the tavern is occupied by a museum, the first floor is divided between a restaurant and a bar
The restaurant serves outstanding food at prices that would make even a wall street tycoon think twice
I had a game hen and my companion ordered the vegetarian dish
We were both extremely satisfied with the meal, and found the whole dining experience very enjoyable
The decor has an old yet comfortable motif, and the staff is extremely courteous
The Fraunces bar is a favorite of mine
The drinks are a little pricey, but the atmosphere is great
The lounge in the back is a treasureabout which few patrons know
Have eaten here many times
Love the historic building and the food, but this restaurant cannot handle a busy day
Whenever it's busy, the service is very slow
A lunch could take 2 hours or more
They are understaffed both in the kitchen and in the dining room
The historical atmosphere should be reason enough to pay Frances Tavern a visit
The food was great and the water made the evening unforgettable
I am definitely going back
Amazing renovation-original murals and historical artifacts adorn this colonial, yet contemporary prize! The seafood cobb salad with chunks of fresh crab and lobster meat is so good, it's hard to try something new
For the meat lovers, the rack of lamb is a mouthwatering favorite
Don't forget to leave room for the homemade deserts! For an after work cocktail, or a business luncheon- this downtown landmark does not disappoint
Do not go out of your way to eat at this tavern
The food was expensive, undercooked and tasteless
My pumkin soup tasted like a thick chicken broth without a hint of pumpkin flavor

The sushi was fresh and smooth and the presentation was excellent
We loved how the placed looked and how quickly the chefs worked
We sat at the bar, and the chef who conversed with us made excellent recommendations and catered to us perfectly
(Spider roll was great, and fatty tuna is in season now!) However, the waitstaff is a bit strained and it took a while to get our check
The check came out to be more expensive than anticipated, but for dinner at Times Square I wouldn't complain (everythings expensive there, with usually pretty bad food too
) If you're in the square and need a sushi fix, this is a great place to start!
No actual sushi connoisseur would find this place acceptable
In New York City, there are many amazing sushi spots, and this is not one of them
I made the mistake this evening of ordering delivery from this joint when my favorite place already closed for the evening
The result was a $50 tab for some of the most mediocre to poor sushi I have ever tasted
I could not get myself to finish any of the order
Even the guilt of spending that much on a meal could not help me finish the uninspired, dull food on my plate
STAY AWAY
Save your appetite for the many more deserving places, and leave this place to those who are just not in the know
If you're looking for a place near Times Square to eat try Haru
Good Japanese restaurant with a nice ambience
I've been here on several occasions and usually order an appetizer shrimp vegetable Tempura along with another main and roll or a sushi platter to share
You don't need to order too much before you're full on this tasty cuisine
Sweet cocktails complete the meal
I'll be back
We love the food! But, It was the delivery time that we found hard to believe! It was last Saturday evening at around 4 pm
My wife ordered 2 appetizers and some bottle waters for deliverly
It took more than an hour and a half to got here
We could have cooked a meal by ourselves if we knew it took such a long time
Unbelievable!
I have been here twice and its a very nice atmosphere
I belive their dishes are good but not extraordinary
The second time when I went, I tried the Crispy Duck and it was good but expensive
The rule is: If it's a restaraunt in Times Square, most likely it's not good! And Haru is one of them! Really, the food is worst than Japanese take-out, but they charge you a high price for low quality food
Haru's sushi is really quite good
It is more expensive than some other sushi places in the theater district
Service is fine
The problem I have with Haru is that is a very noisy restaurant
Granted I was there at dinner time, but no restaurant should be that noisy-one has to fight to hear the people talking at your own table
Never a pleasant experience
Go to Haru on the off hours-you'll enjoy it more!
Service was wonderful at this restaurant, fish was fresh,spicy tuna was the best
However my husband and I were a little shocked to have paid for the Green tea for these prices that's the least they can do
This is a great place to go after work to meet friends and colleagues for drinks and sushi
The sushi is good here, but their menu is not very different from most sushi restaurants
The drinks, however, are really unique and they have a great variety of cocktails
The drinks are very pretty, generous in size, and mixed very well
The seating is comfortable too
You can sit down at a table to eat a meal, or just sit at the bar for drinks
Look for the cocktail menu!
Decent Japanese food but the service was terrible
The wait staff was inexperienced and slow witted
You have to ask for things several times and they still don't remember
I would stay away from Haru Broadway because my exp w/the new midtown location off Park was good, though pricey
This restaurant is so great
If you love Sushi, this place is a great place to come
It's right in the heart of Times Square and after dinner there's tons of other stuff to do
The service was excellent and the food exquisite! I highly recommend Haru's!
After trying Haru on the Upper East Side, we also tried their Broadway location
It's has a little more ambience, better decor, and more space than the one on the Upper East Side, but the same good food
Good presentation, very fresh sushi, good food
We had reservations for pre-theather, and would recommend it, but right at 6pm, it wasn't too busy
If you are looking for a more intimite setting, I recommend the Upper East Side
It's much smaller and lacks the crowds of mid-town
Sushi was very nice and reasonably priced
We dined around 2pm on a Saturday, so there were only a few tables occupied
Waitress was unfriendly, slow and did not remember to bring items we requested
We paid the bill leaving a tip that was roughly $1 short of 15%
This was not even intentional
She actually came back to our table and presented us with a card stating we should tip at least 15%-20%
We found this pushy and rude considering the service we received
we eat at broadway haru twice a week, we love the sushi and the service is marvelous, but the mix drink is awkful
The only thing that i hate is that the manager always stand on the bar chating with the bartender
It is very annoying
I love Haru for the simple fact that it always serves up delicious sushi and fusion cuisine
Everytime I eat at Haru, the food is consistently great and the service too
I find this to be the same at all of the locations as well
The field green salad with ginger dressing is a personal favorite and the dressing is divine and the rock shrimp tempura with spicy sauce is great
The drinks are also fun and tasty
We discovered this restaurant on a whim and it has become one of our favorite sushi restaurants
We have never tried any of the other locations but have been to this location several times
The service and food have been consistent throughout our visits
The sushi is delicious
melt in your mouth
and the crab dumpling appetizer is very tasty
in addition the wait staff and hostesses are very nice and cordial
The restaurant is very modern and trendy and the prices are reasonable
Come early or reserve
we have seen this restaurant become very busy in a few minutes
Very unfortunate that the only dessert available is ice cream
get dessert somewhere else after dinner
This restaurant is the youngest in the chain of Harus
However it has shaped up well from being a bit shaky when it opened
The seating is fast and service is in general adequate
One thing to complain about is that the sushi pieces are too big/long for an ordinary person and has to be chewed in half, but this is afterall a matter of taste
Otherwise the sushibar is long and accommodating and it can be fun to see the rest of the patrons from the slightly elevated position by the bar
A popular Upper East Side sushi chain lands its flagship location on Park Avenue
Tanks of robotic fish and a 50-foot sushi bar are the visual highlights of this sleek eatery, the fourth and largest outpost of sushi chain Haru
Expect big strips of fish and a spillover crowd from Haru's recently opened location at 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue
I've been ordering for delivery here for the past year, and I've dined here a few times
Their food is GREAT!! I highly recommend the duck salad, seaweed salad, kamikazi roll, shrimp tempura roll, and eel don
I think their sushi and chirashi entrees are good deals
When I dined here, we had decent service; they were polite but not TOO attentive
However, it wasn't bad service at all
The atmosphere is lovely, with a trendy vibe, and each time, there was a lot of people

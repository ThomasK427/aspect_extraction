Unfortunately the skies opened up and the outside dining room was not an option but next time we will be there
Signor Davor Petrovic and his head waiter Leonardo and the rest of the staff were totally awesome as usual
As we were leaving my family asked when could we get together for another family party at this fabulous bistro
This truly was an evening my father and family will not forget
Grazie Davor and Signor Giovanni Lovine
For park sloper's just try an afternoon appetizer, see for yourself
Molti grazi Signor Lupo e familiglia 6/24/06 PS
Try the Tira mi su for dessert you'll see
two weeks ago myself and some girlfriends from work went out to Futura to celebrate a colleagues birthday
The restaraunt had a varied selection of cocktails, wines and afew beers from europe
The food was outstanding
I personally reccomend the oregano scented lamb shank utterly fabulous, a international selection of appetizers as well
A romantic evening would be better, atleast the bartender was cute and knew how to mix a drink
superb
I just wanted to find a good local place to eat at in Park Slope, went on citysearch and found this
never heard of it, never tried it obviously so my girlfriend and I went over there and were we ever suprised! I noticed that someone put up a lousy review of the place, but I want to say, Don't believe it! This place has such a great, relaxed atmosphere, the service could not be more friendly, and knowledgeable too, which never hurts
The food was delicious, everything was reasonably priced and the wine list was easy and fun to pick from! I will be a long-time regular from now on!! Thanks Futura!
Bad
So Bad
It was funny
We were laughing
Is this possible? After 30 minutes, the water arrived
Another 15 minutes, the bread arrived
However, half of us never got a glass of water, despite numerous requests
Another 35 minutes, and 6 out of 8 dishes came out
Whoops! Guess it happens all the time
Some dishes were forgotten on the walk to the kitchen i guess
Totally understandable
Another 30 minutes the forgotten dishes arrived
However, they were not the dishes ordered! The waitor said the 2 forgotten dishes would be on the house however, he charged us
And had extra charges on the bill
How many times can you mess up? it was amazing! The first time in my life that i left no tip on a 200 dollar bill
im a regular at Giovanni Iovine borgo antico for the past 11 years,and i wasthrilled to to go to Futura
the welcoming and warm spirit of Giovannis Greenwich Village Italian eatery, Borgo Antico, into this newest feat
With a menu that matches the diversity of its Park Slope locale, gio has created a kitchen away from your kitchenette
Futuras basics with a bent are strongly influenced by Argentine and Italian heritage
And the International wine list tangos harmoniously with the all-embracing comfort-fare; featuring Italian, French, Argentine and US wines
The varied and affordable eats makes this the perfect destination when youre lost in a cloud of indecision
try now
I knew my girl wanted to eat out somewhere for Valentine's Day
and I had no reservation that morning
Well, I happened to go to the post office on 9th St
, and there was Futura -- I had never seen it before
Long story short, I made a reservation, brought my girl there that night and we had an incredible time! The wine list was affordable and the wine we chose was perfect, the food was timely and more importantly it was delicious! I mean, it might have been the great atmosphere and the friendly service, but in any case, I really really thought it was outstanding for the (very) reasonable prices
Definitely a huge save for me, and definitely worth many many return visits
this is our new special place for a long time to come! Long live Futura!!
I can't believe how remarkable Futura is
I hadn't even heard of it until I passed by it
I really recommend it now
After have dinner with a promising friend of mine I could say that Futura will be known by all
Coming in we were greeted making us very welcomed
The ambient was very soothing and pace
It will bring u close 2 whoever u are with
The cuisine was very tasteful
There isn't a dish that wouldn't satisfy your appetite
U have to see for yourself
Being here makes me want to come back all the time
It will make u feel the same
A big thumbs up
I was in Futura with my boyfriend ,and we had one of the most perfect romantic dinner that I ever had
The ambient are cozy,very good and friendly service and realy great food! Whole dinner was fresh and delicius tasty
I'll definitly suggest the pasta special and the homemade tiramisu
I've only been a Park Slope resident for two weeks, but I've gone to Futura twice already
Both times I've had absolutely scrumptious food paired with tasty drinks
Not only has the atmosphere been warm and relaxing, but the manager has been incredibly attentive
Even while I was feeling a little sniffly during the first visit, the cute bartender made me some tea to help clear up my sinuses
Futura has totally sucked me in and I will definitely be coming back soon
Futura was a disappointment
I attended with a party of six and everyone was disappointed in the food and especially the service
There was one waiter and an order for our table was forgotten
When he was reminded, he brought the wrong order
We failed to received water after multiple requests
The quality of food was poor
The two orders of salmon were burned and foul tasting
He had such an unpleasant time we didn't leave a tip and bought dessert at another restaurant
I definately don't recommend this establishment
There is a better Argentinian/Italian Restaurant on West Broadway in Manhattan
i came in to meet a friend and stayed for dessert! The waitstaff were prompt and very informative with regards to the menu
i had the the Frisee salad with Roasted Pear
it was the tastiest salad i've had in months
leaving me wanting more but left me with just enough room for my main course the Linguine with Spinach
so tasty! and for dessert i highly recommend the creme brulee made with orange and honey! the musc is not overpowering and the seating is spacious
the brick walls with hanging art add the ambience that make this a comfortable yet elegant bistro in the heart of Brooklyn!
I came in from the sign on the street that said there was wireless internet and a two course lunch for 8 bucks! I ended up staying for 3 1/2 hours after lunch! The meal was really good and for such a good price! The waiters are cute, the wine and capuccino was fantastic! The creme brulee was sweeter than I've ever had
They later told me it had orange and honey!mmmmm I sat right by the window and people watched as i surfed the internet
Overall, it was a great afternnoon
My husband and I came here for Valentine's Day dinner
The ambiance was romantic, though seating too close to others marred that somewhat
Only one waiter--also the host--served a packed restaurant of around 50 people
Though seated immediately, it was five minutes before we received a menu
There were no non-alcoholic beverages on the menu, but the waiter brought me a tasty virgin cocktail he didn't name
Our delicious empanada appetizer arrived promptly, but our entrees took awhile
My husband's short ribs were cooked longer than well-done, but his carrot mashed potatoes were exquisite
My linguine was covered with too much oil
Though our meals weren't great, I suspect the chef was rushing
They should have more staff, fewer tables, and the coat checker should've hostessed
For now, Futura patrons might want to come for lunch, as I suspect this place does better when they're less busy
Futura Bistro Modern is a favorite spot for anyone with a fine taste for the good things in life
Beautiful people there are always ready to please and they give this elegant place the perfect setting in which to enjoy a great meal
Whether you are looking for a quiet spot to relax, an exciting place to meet a group of friends or an intimate time with a significant other, here you can have it all

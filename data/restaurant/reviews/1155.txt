Food wise, try the three favor Guacamole
Cant say enough about it
As far as East Village dining goes, this is not one to miss
You wont be disappointed
The most personable staff including chef in a delightful place
Delicious food led by a chef who is not afraid to cross boundaries
An in-the-know place
When you long to be on a beach in Mexico with a fish taco in your hand and sand under your feet (which lets face it you do right now) this is the next best thing
Super fresh ceviche and small tacos will take you straight there
All the salsas and tortillas, down to the chips are prepared there by hand
The mango chipotle guac will have you licking the bowl and while the portions seem small at first, I followed the server's recommendations and left completely satisfied with the taste of these amazing mushroom tostadas lingering in my mouth
The jamaica margartia is perfect
And don't miss the coconut flan
I walked into an empty restaurant at six on a weeknight and the host gave me a hard time about arriving before my other friend
I understand about not seating a party before everyone arrives, but the restaurant is small and I was the only person there
He also wanted me to call and find out where she was, nervous about people who had reservations
As if they were about to be swamped with 6:30 reservations
I did call my friend, but to tell her to meet me somewhere else
We were seated late, and then told there was a time limit on our table
The service was exceptionally slow, and then we were asked (in an extremely condescending way) to leave before we even finished our meal!   The food is fine, but there are many infinitely better options for Latin fare in the area
Those who don't require a bridge and/or tunnel to reach Mercadito are in for a real treat - great food, attentive service, and excellent margaritas in a small but charming East Village spot
This is a TAPAS restaurant
It says it on the menu and the servers explain it to you as soon as you sit down so I'm surprised by how many people on this site complain about the portion sizes
If you follow the servers' recommendations and order several dishes to share with your table you're in for some intense flavors from both the food and drinks
When we had to wait 15 minutes for our reservation on a busy Saturday night they offered up a free round of drinks and a trio guacamole appetizer at the bar
This is not a burrito place
Those looking for something a bit more creative are sure to enjoy
I was going to write this review in spanish because I want my people from Mexico to know that there's a great authentic Mexican restaurant in NYC
I am Mexican and the food is unbelievably good
Started with a Pepino margarita and followed it with a guacamole tasting (mango is out of this world), then our waitress recommended the ceviche tasting, we tried the ceviche de pulpo, camaron, and robalo
they're so good that you'll end drinking the broth at the end
Of course we ordered some tacos, we tried the tacos de camaron, they are amazing!!! and finally we finished with the tacos al pastor, very very very authentic !! THANK YOU MERCADITO FOR BRINGING REAL MEXICAN FOOD TO NYC
Marcadito has potential but it's way too expensive for the neighborhood
The margueritas are very good but for $8
50 they are on the small side without enough tequila
The ceviche had way too much onion which masked the flavor of the fish
The tacos were good but really tiny
The space is small and the backroom smells damp
This restaurant would be great if it were cheap but it is not in fact, it is on the pricier side of any Mexican restaurant I have ever been to
service was terrible
guacamole is way below average standard
margaritas are expensive not great
tacos were overwhelmed by sauce
ceviche was described as 'spicy' and came out with a sweet orange sauce
waited over an hour and a half on a not crowded night for entrees
this was my 2nd time here, shoulda stuck with my decision after the first time never gone back
SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME/$ and avoid this restaurant
you'll thank me later
I have heard so much about mercadito and everything was true
People have said that the portions are small, but our server told us exactly what to order
Yes, one plate would be to small for anyone, but the idea is to share
We started with the best Guacamole that I've ever eaten
We ended with shrimp tacos and baked oysters
It was incredible
We left feeling just right, except that the margarita can catch up to you
I love when service is interactive
If you go, take their advice
I understand tapas are small portions, but this was ridiculous
I went for Saturday brunch, and was still really hungry after my meal
I ordered the steak tortillas
The entree was comprised of 4 small tortillas for $10
To my disappointment, each tortilla was about 3 inches in diameter, and had about 3-4 REALLY small cubes of steak
Granted the steak and guacamole were tasty, it wasn't worth $10
I've been to other nice tapas restaurants in NYC in much better neighborhoods, and the avg price was about $7 - $8
And the kicker was the price for coffee
I'm not talking about specialty coffee or anything, just the regular drip coffee
It's been a long time since I've been to a restaurant that charges per cup of coffee for brunch
Each refill was $2
50 per cup
After a long night, my coffee bill was more than my tapas bill
Amazing in every sense of the word, the tacos are the best noth of the border, try the steak tacos the beer battered fish tacos
The shrimp ceviche octopus ceviche are the best
The handmade quesadillas are just delicious
The tampiquena steak entree is really good
Try the tequila mojitos or the cucumber margarita
Great idea, tequila bar only, who doesn't like margaritas? Brunch is probably one of the best in the city
I have been there at least 25 times, try it
You have to remember this place isn't inexpensive necessarily, the plates may each only be $10, but it's tapas style, so you have to order a lot to get full
Everyone gets a bite of everything, that's the whole point
People who understand this initially won't have any issue with the restaurant
The food is great, and being from California it's hard to impress me with Mexican
The sangria is delicious and the service is prompt
Also, servers are very knowledgeable and seem to have the answers to any question you might have about a dish
Definitely try the mango guacamole and the shrimp tacos!
For anyone who doesn't get it, small plates doesn't mean skimpy portions, it means small plates for tasting lots of different things
This is a restaurant concept that has taken off and something you can either embrace or not
The servers are very specific when you order, so there is no confusion
Mercadito has done a wonderful job, bringing authentic mexican dishes and fantastic drinks (the mojito was the BEST I have ever had) to the East Village
Also recommended: shrimp ceviche, the guacamole tasting (OH MY GOD!) and the calamari tacos
Foodies will be in heaven here
Maybe the portion sizes are on the small size, but coming from a person that has absolutely no portion control, I appreciated it
4 tacos per plate and they are mini tacos, but just order a few things for the table and you are able to try many items on the menu
The guac tasting menu should not be missed it consists of regular guac, pineapple guac, and a mango version all excellent
I liked the fact that when I left I didnt feel overstuffed and nauseous, as I usually do after binge-fests at other Mexican restaurants
The ritas are great, kinda small but lots of versions to try
And Mercadito is the only place I have ever been that offers Low-carb margaritas
Its about time that someone did that
Ambience, small and cozy, but lively at the same time
I always love to try new places, but after this experience I think I'll wait a while before trying anywhere I dont personally know
The food was average at best, whatever food you actually got!!! I am not exaggerating when I say that me and my girlfriend, after spending nearly $40 each, walked out of this place HUNGRY!! I think someone has to remind the management that this is Mexican food not French!!   The menu is very decieving when it comes to the portions

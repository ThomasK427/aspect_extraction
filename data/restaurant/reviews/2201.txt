SAT NEXT TO A TABLE OF GOOD 'OL BOYS (REGULARS)
THEY WERE NICE AND FRIENDLY
WE ORDERED THE FILET MIGNON AND IT WAS SPECTACULAR AND HUGE
THE BREAD BASKET, SALADS AND DESSERTS (CHEESECAKE AND WARM MAPLE CUSTARD) WERE SUBLIME
I WISH I LIVED IN NY
I WOULD EAT THERE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE
This is the prototype for pricey, quality steakhouses
The steaks are delicious, dry aged (you see them when you walk in the door) and cooked well (thoughthey tend to go a little rarer than what you order, so if you want med
rare, order medium - beter yet, tell your waiter how you like it bloody, pink brown etc and he'll get it to you just the way you want it
) The waitstaff is well trained and helpful
The portions are HUGE
Have never had any problems with the prime or any of the steaks
(and if you read that they are fatty - they should have fat on them - they have to have fat to get flavor!) Here's the surprise: go for the sorbets - best we've ever had!
We went for lunch and order their ribeye steak from their pre-fix menu
The steak was so fatty! The waiter practically rushed us through our meal but made us wait half an hour for the check
Good ambience, but the experience and food were nothing special
All the great steak houses have their own character and understood level of formality; Gallagher's is low on the formality for the guests, high on formality for the staff
The tuxedoed waiters never let our water glasses get half full; orders were taken promptly and delivered accurately, with proper timing
Since it's in the theater district, we didn't have much trouble getting an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday
And just so you don't have to ask, the Gallagher's potatoes on the menu are three thick fried wedges, served with a house-made steak sauce
I chose Gallagher's for my pre-theater meal based on the positive reviews I read here
I'm writing to prevent others from making the same mistake
The service was cordial, but not very attentive at all
We were seated promptly and brought rolls and water but then were made to wait much too long before our beverage order was taken and then much much too long before our waiter came back for a food order
The food came quickly though, almost too quickly
Our salads and appetizers were brought at the same time and we barely had time to enjoy them before a team of waiters whisked them (and our bread!) away and served our entrees
The food was tasty, but not stellar
The ambience would be clever if the food and service were better; instead it just cemented the unfortunate second-rate-ness of the whole experience
Went to Gallaghers, had there porterhouse and my guest had the filet
The best cuts of beef I have ever had
The portions for the sides were HUGE
The service was great
Went to Gallaghers on 6/1/02
Had the best prime beef ever
The steaks were cooked perfectly
Great atmosphere
Service was superb!
I went with a party of 4 others for dinner at this place the other night
The lady who worked there gave us an attitude the whole time we were there
Hey, if you're looking for crappy pizza with lots of (bad) NY attitude, this is your place
While visiting New York, we (my family) grabbed some pizza while walking around Times Square
What a surprise !!! We all agreed it was the best pizza we have ever had
I dream of this pizza
I love the thin crust, and the cheese is awesome
We tried several different pieces, and they were all good
We can't wait to visit New York again so we can have some more of Ray's pizza
Know what you want when you get in line, or get ready to get some good natured heat from the guys behind the counter
The pizza's excellent, leaving you wanting more!!
is so much better than Ray's on 8th
I couldn't believe how much better it was
The crust had just the right amount of oven char and crispness
Well worth the walk over
Aside from the humongous slices that they serve, the taste is truely unique
I am a pizza lover and I can eat it on a daily basis
Ray's pizza is one that I will never get tired of
I've been many palce and have tasted pizza in just about most of those places and they just have not been able to comapre to the taste of pizza
Over a period of time some restaurants tend to loose the quality of the taste of their food, but not Ray's
I rank it a #1 and it's in my top three of the best pizza joints
Although the slices are huge I really didn't like it because of too much cheese and not enough sauce for me
I want to be able to eat my pizza with my hand and you just can't with this pizza
The taste just isn't unique
There are so many better places to have pizza in New York that while this Ray's is ok for your average slice, if you are looking for a top-notch pie look elsewhere
This establishment is like every other pizza shop in NY
It has a variety of pizza combinations, calzones, meat patties and main dishes like lasagna
Their pizza is better than average and the service is typical NY rush in and out
Don't expect anything grand
it is just a pizza shop!
This branch of Ray's is next to my office and I was in the mood for a slice of pizza for lunch and I decided to go to Ray's
BIG MISTAKE! I found the girl who waited on me to be EXTREMELY RUDE and NASTY for no apparent reason and the pizza was rather doughy and raw and didn't taste like it was cooked
Between the rude service and the bad pizza avoid this place just isn't worth it!
Good spot to pop into when you're hungry and on the clock
Multiple choices for slices and I've enjoyed the pepperoni and the sausage
You can order, eat and be back on the street in 7 minutes
Good spot
This pizza is awfull!! Thick and mooshey, most of the time the cheese is just congealed nastyness
I feel bad for all the out of towners who hear about how great ny pizza is and mistakenly try this thinking its real ny pizza
At the insane price its not even a bargin
Rays =shopping mall pizza!
In Short The much-copied look of hardwood floors, decorative stained glass, checked tablecloths, brass rails and walls filled with knickknacks has been a staple at this restaurant franchise
Originally a hit for its frisky bar scene, Friday's is now known just as much for its kid-friendly entrees
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers
My wife and i went to order drinks
She ordered a mixed drink and I tried to order a malternative
The waiter didn't know what we were talking about, and neither did the bartender
(Please note, we've ordered these drinks at several different Friday's several times before
) We just got a potato skins appetizer, and several of them were horribly burnt to a crisp
We would have told our waiter, but he didn't stop at our table until at least 15 min after we had finished eating what was edible, not even to ask how things were going
In Short This offshoot of a popular New Orleans hangout for politicians features decor of dark woods and comfortable booths, with a separate bar scene
Choice cuts of custom-aged beef arrive in sizzling butter on 500-degree plates
The menu also offers chicken, pork and seafood entrees along with Creole appetizers like shrimp remoulade
Family-style sides include gargantuan onion rings, creamed spinach and various styles of potatoes
Traditional homemade desserts like cheesecake and bread pudding conclude the meal
Great food, great service - one of the best dining experiences I have ever had
Definitely try the veal ravioli-to die for!
What else can be said, but an outstanding place to have a great steak for dinner
The only disappointment was on our second visit too many tourist taking a lot of pictures and where also dressed down ( we could have shown up in jeans, sneakers)
That said Ruth's Chris is both highly recommended by my girlfriend and me
WE ARRIVED EXACTLY 8 MIN LATE, ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE BOOTH I REQUESTED WAS GIVEN AWAY
ONCE SEATED(APPROX 45 MIN LATER) THE WAITRESS GAVE US THE RUNDOWN

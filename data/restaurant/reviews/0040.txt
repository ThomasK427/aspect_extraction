) I didn't care much for the udon
I loved the sushi however and was disappointed that the sushi combo only came with 6 pieces of, albeit delicious, sushi
The price was decent though and the service was excellent
All in all, a good place that I'd gladly visit again, but I'd order just the sushi next time
The Scene With wood-paneled ceilings in the clubby bar, semi-private lounges upstairs, banquettes upholstered in Weimeraner-gray mohair and architectural drawings decorating the walls, Patroon feels both graceful and understated, Old World and sumptuous
Even if you're just a middling junior exec, staff service makes you feel like a board member
The Food To start, opt for Kumamoto oysters served in a pristine pewter bowl packed with crushed ice
Or try the mellow foie gras terrine, which is a tasty guilty pleasure
The Maine lobster entree is wonderfully fresh and huge
The Patroon burger--Angus beef topped with a roasted tomato--is simple, yet able to stand on its own against any fully loaded competitor
The decadent ice cream sundae is excellent
Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate
This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates
Not a great place for family or general dining
We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the PAST! The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible, reaching for sunglasses
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size
I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime
They couldn't even make a salad that was appealing
We spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed
Last memorial day, I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but
)
I figured I would give it another try
3 weeks ago I made reservations for Saturday night
Today, I get a call telling me that they are closed that day (Saturday?) and subsequent Saturday's for the rest of the year
Unbelievable
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort
This place is to be avoided
Overall a disappointing experience for that price category
The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away
I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse
Went last Thursday
Great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet
We left after one drink
I would go back tho
It's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night
Check it out
Disappointed in the selection on the restaurant week menu (which did not include any steak entrees) but impressed with the actual food- everything was very good- fresh and innovative- saffron risotto was not too powerful and the entrees were all good
Would go back when I was ordering off the regular menu and give the steak a try
Service felt a little rushed but they may have been trying to accomodate us as it was lunch time
The Scene Petite Abeille is one of the more charming restaurants around, ideal for a lazy lunch or light dinner
The space is small and homey--blue-and-white checkerboard tablecloths cover the tables, a chalkboard serves as a wine list, and the walls carry more Tintin memorabilia than a French nursery school
The Food The French-Belgian menu is small, and everything on it is satisfyingly savory, such as a simple pot of mussels in a choice of sauces (beer and bacon, creamy mushroom, or white wine-and-garlic broth); beef stewed with beer and prunes; and a juicy croque monsieur
The pommes frites are top-notch, and there's an impressive array of Belgian beers to pair with your meal
Desserts, by and large, are missable, but chances are you won't have room left
A friend recommended Petite Abeille to me and we ordered take-out; I got the tuna nicoise salad and she got a roast beef sandwich
Her sandwich was delightful and I LOVED my salad
Fresh, flavorful, and light
the tomatoes were marinated in vinegar
I loved it so much that I proceeded to go back the following week
and AGAIN the week after that
The restaurant is tiny and cozy and everything is so fresh
If I had a longer lunch break I'd come here, get a table, and enjoy the small French restaurant setting every day!
I discovered this little alcove on a trip shopping with my roomate and we stopped in for brunch
The crepes were wonderful, the fillings were warm and soft, and the restaurant was rather cute looking
I however, didn't think the macchiato was worth what I paid, but other than that, it was a good experience and my roomate and I left happy
stopped by for some brunch after shopping around the area
the service was very good and the food was high quality (fresh ingredients)
i had the salmon spinach quiche which came out warm and the green salad that came with the dish was also fresh
since it's a pretty small place, it's best to go alone (sit by the window) or with a friend
they also have a take-out section near the back which makes it convenient for neighborhood folk
cozy atmosphere and a great menu selection
The food is very good and reasonably priced
The service is very good
Portions are medium-sized
The seating arrangements are annoying, though
It is very small, (about 6 or 7 tables) and although there is a bar area where you can sit facing the street-side window, the table is barely deep enough to support your plate
This place needs to expand
They're certainly good enough (and popular enough -- this is *not* a secret and waits can be long) to warrant it
The mussels and fries at this place were amazing! They were by far the best that I have had outside of Belgium - and the selection of beers was fabulous
The prices were very resonable when you don't factor in the cost of beer (which seemed to be on the high side)
Great fries, and one of the best tuna sandwiches in the city--spicy and light on the mayo
The people who work there are sweethearts
The Scene It's a snug fit: Diners squeeze between tables to take seats at the banquettes lining the walls; those waiting for a table try to stay out of the way by snuggling up to the four-seat bar up front
Depending on your persuasion, the noise level is either enjoyably bustling or a bit too loud, but the energy in the room is good, and service is smart and efficient
The Food Mussels, steamed with a tiny bit of green chili and aromatic mint, and a fresh salad of cucumbers and ricotta salata prove that despite its enduring popularity, this place isn't resting on its laurels
The kitchen nails pasta dishes, including spicy linguine with clams and pancetta and perfect gnocchi
Entrees are quite good, especially the porcini-crusted cod and a nicely gamey lamb sirloin with cumin yogurt
Desserts are equally satisfying--try the ricotta cheesecake or the house sundae
We went to Po this past weekend and had one of the best dining experiences ever
The service was incredible, the waiter was extremely helpful with choosing a wine and describing each dish in great detail
We were seated immediately, although I highly recommend a recommendation as Po is a small restaurant
We had the six course tasting menu
Every course was delicous
It included a salad, two pasta dishes, a main dish, a cheese plate and two deserts to die for
At $48 per person, I found it to be a bargain
You will be highly impressed and like us talk about going back before you even leave the restaurant
I have been to Po three times over the last few years and it has been consistently great
Historically best experiences have been when I ordered the Chefs tasting menu
This time around was no exception
Each course was very good, especially the pumpkin ravioli
At $48 per person it's a bargain
The wine list is also very reasonable too
The good service started from the moment we walked in the front door
Give it a try, you will not be disappoined !
What got us to try this restaurant in the first place is the old man that sits by the front everynight
He's very friendly and tells you stories of famous folks that have come to his family's restaurant
Tells people he's the 'mayor of the block'

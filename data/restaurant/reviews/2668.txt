I was pleasantly suprised to find a great sushi restaurant in an unassuming area
The special rolls are innovative and masterfully prepared
This is a fantastic find for a sushi lover
I grew up on this pizza, and so has my family of generations
They use the finest ingredients and make their pizza so perfectly
I LOVE IT! My uncle used to eat there every day after school and lunch on the weekends for his entire youth
I was only able to eat there every Sunday, or I would have been there everyday
The family who operates the business is very nice and professional
I would highly recommend it to all!
I wish more New Yorkers could make the trip to Victory Blvd to taste these pies
Best pizza in the city, no doubt
The mozzarella sticks are exceptional as well
This is the best pizza in all of the five boroughs
Hands down
Thin crust, not too much cheese and great sauce
Joe Pat's Pizzeria features a unique thin crust pizza with an especially wonderfully tasting tomato sauce
The mozzerella cheese is not grated, but cut into chunks, then baked in a rotisserie oven, which adds to the experience of savoring the best slice of Pizza in NYC! Joe bakes the best pie in the Tri-State area! (Pat has since moved on to the real estate business) His team of experts includes the Maitre'd - his wife Lena, and his son Angelo who have supported the establishment for many years
Joe's pie making team is the best in the business, and have been taught the master's lesson in banging out the dough to form the perfect thin crust
Do not hesitate to get out to Joe Pats any day of the week for a superior slice of NY Pizza!!! My compliments to the best! Glenn Miele
Best Pizza period
Dad went there back when it opened ('65?) and has been bringing the kids ever since
Anytime I come up from Texas, it's the first place we go
A deliciously thin crust, topped with a sweet tangy sauce and real mozzerella cheese--this is real NY pizza!
Great think crust, incredible sauce and just the right amount of cheese add up to perfection in the fogotten boro (Staten Island)
I have been enjoying the pizza at Joe and Pat's Pizzeria for about 45 years
It is still exactly the same
A lively and tasty tomato sauce, just the right amount of mozzerella cheese, all on a thin and crispy crust
For me this is the benchmark of all pizzas
Simply put , the best in the U
S
Fast, friendly service
The best french onion soup on Staten Island
Feeling of family
I have been using Tacks for take-out forever
I moved and we were nervous tack's would not deliver to us, but since we had been using him for so long, we asks and he makes the delivery for us anyway
The food is amazing there!
Tack's is a take-out only chinese restaurant that does very brisk business, but it is for a reason
Their food is always fresh and delicious
I'd put Tack's up against just about any take out place on Staten Island and be confident it would destroy them in food quality
Mr
Tack and his family are also quite friendly and accomodating
The Best Potatoe Salad in The World
Family Owned and Operated and the catering is terrific, especially the meatballs and steak pizziola
From #2
Mr
Pizza's is a good place to grab a quick bite
Their small seating area in back has more atmosphere than most pizzerias and the food is very good
It has never been very crowded when we've gone but that's a good thing
Their pasta and baked dishes are very satisfying and hearty
The Scene There are two sides to every neighborhood and in this case, restaurant
In front, it's a basic pizza joint
But walk past the ovens and you'll discover G-Bar, a candlelit back-room lounge with a classy bar, intimate dining tables and small stage showcasing live music Thursday through Saturday
But it's the excellent and affordable food that attract a diverse clientele that includes locals, Yankees fans and nearby court workers looking for an alternative to Chinese takeout
The Food The Giovannis opened their first restaurant in 1974; this pizzeria opened in 1992, and G-Bar was added in 2001
In addition to Italian staples like pasta, chicken and veal parmigiana, house specials like chicken Giovanni (chicken breast with sausage, sauteed in white wine) and linguini Giovanni (shrimp and clams in red sauce) keep the menu interesting
The all-you-can-eat garlic knots and chocolate martinis constitute a meal by themselves
One of my most favorite N
Y
treats has always been Pizza, good old fashioned, 'old school' Bronx Pizza
I've sampled countless ones in search of that familiar taste I remember over 30 years ago, Giovanni's (@ Grand Concourse) is it
'My search is over!
This is a restaurant for the whole family
Great tasting food and it wont break you pocket
They have a so called Combo meal, wish 4 people could eat for for $15
00 you get Rice, Beans, a whole barbecue chicken, salad and even the soda is included
so check it out you wont go wrong
The slice at Vinny's Is set at a resonable price
The quality of the food aswell as the products used to make the food is never short of the best
If you don't feel like a Slice grab a chicken roll which is one of the best i've ever had
Thge ravioliis also a goo choice
Enjoy
If you are looking for the best pizza in the Bronx, stay away from Bona pizza
If you are looking for the worst pizza in the Bronx, better yet all of New York, this is the place you want to be
Everything from the thick, dry, tough cheese to the dried up, salty sauce is disgusting
If you're ever on Westchester Avenue, you are far better off going to the supermarket down the block to get some of the $1 store brand frozen pizzas
this is a remarkable pastry shop with all the sweets to send you to the moon and back
The canolis are to die for and the coffee is amazing
I have to admit that i was most impressed with their ttiramisu
It was the best that i have ever had adn it left me craving another bite
Make sure that when you go in you meet the owner who is as lovely as they can be
This place is too overlooked
If anyone would want a truly delicious pizza, they should come here
It is a casual atmosphere only blocks away from The Bronx's Little Italy, but it is better than any other place on 187th Street
Also, they have specials, and, the service is excellent
When you take a bite of a slice you can taste the top-quality products used- there is no scrimping on quality
It is how Bronx pizza was meant to taste- it is what people from around the world expect
Also- inexpensive!
i have dined here many times with my family and we always keep coming back for more, the most outstanding thing on the menu seems to be the veal which is really outstanding here particularly the veal oscar
The portions are also very good
This place is the real deal and more private and relaxing than the other restaurants south on the Avenue
By far the best fried calamari--never been disappointed
And the other food is just as good
Highly recommend the Penne with sausage and brocolli rabe
Just on the north end of the Arthur Ave
area, this gem is often overlooked
Recently renovated family-run coffee shop
Your standard fare Greek coffee shop where you can watch them prepare your food
One of the oldest businesses in the neighborhood, a lovely family and a restaurant to support
And the food is surprisingly fresh and tasty
This place is quick and effective

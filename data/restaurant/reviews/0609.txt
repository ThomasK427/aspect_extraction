It took 3 hours to eat a entree and dessert the service was so slow
We had to ask the waiter 3 times for water, the waiter was unattentive
Best bet check out the cool cigar bar downstairs with the great flat screen TV, and for Nuevo Latino Cuisine go to Jimmys Downtown, Chicama, Patria, Noche, or Calle Ocho
Nice to have another option in the neighborhood
Downstairs bar area is a bit tight, but the cigar room is a plus
Upstairs dining area very nice, great decor
Staff was very polite
Food was quite good
Definitely will return again
After a shaky start, all of the elements are coming together to create a restaurant worth travelling to visit
The ceviche and brochette are great starters
The fish dishes are delicious, as are the meat entrees
Finish off your dinner with a scrumptuous dessert and an espresso
A bit more work on the winelist and they will have it
The restaurant and cafe are elegant and the food is good- nouveau latino
Service is excellent
The cigar lounge boasts its own cigar menu and is never stuffy or hot- very elegant with a flat screen tv for watching your favorite baseball or soccer game
Comfy couches make it casual and fun
And the bar has both a smoking and non-smoking side
Great, elegant cool place in upper manhattan to have a meal or a drink at
Hispaniola had great food, attentive service and a great, cool atmosphere
The dcor was modern, but tasteful
Very comfortable place to have dinner
Patronage ranged from casual to elegant
The Scene Bartenders, sporting jeans and button-down shirts, pour quartinos (quarter bottle pours, served in mini-carafes) of Italian wine to the casually dressed crowds waiting, and waiting, for a table
Walls in the dining rooms are painted a warm terra-cotta, subtly encouraging a boisterous noise level
The Menu One can, and should, make a meal of the excellent antipasti: roast cauliflower with olives; fresh artichokes; sweet eggplant caponatina; and that excellent prosciutto, which arrives, as it should, at room temperature
Indulge in as much gelato as possible--the olive oil version is brilliant; the chocolate is without peer
But skip the pizzas: Despite being topped with house-cured, buttery prosciutto, pungent Taleggio, tender meatballs and the like, they're simply not very good
The thin crust, first griddled and then broiled to warm the toppings, is acceptable straight out of the kitchen, but becomes tough and unpleasant as it cools
Amazing antipasti / vegetable dishes
Very extensive and diverse wine list
Great Italian-style pizza
The desserts were fantastic - the olive oil gelato was superb with little explosions of fleur-du-sel in each mouthful
The service was aloof and overstretched, but this is a pizzeria, so no big deal
After spending over $500 on a business dinner, a manager knelt down at our table and asked us to quote, wrap it up and move to the bar
We apparantely had been at the table for 2 hours and she needed to seat another party
After expressing that this was not the treatment I would expected or tolerate from any restaurant, and that we'd move when we were ready to; she offer to buy us another bottle of wine at the bar
Here's where this manager adds insult to injury
After we in fact moved to the bar, and I told the waitress which bottle we wanted - the one we had been drinking - we were told we had to order off the limited daily specials list
Again, not the treatment I expect or tolerate
There are hundred's of restaurants in this City to chose, stay away from Otto
In the end, you'll get better service from your corner pizzeria
This place fits the bill perfectly for tourists and out-of-towners who expect New York restaurants to be over-rated - complete with a rude/condescending/self-righteous staff
It is not even worth mentioning the pizza/pasta (which is just okay), because the service was so overwhelmingly disappointing and in bad need of an overhaul! Maybe this is because the crowd is so much more touristy and downscale than when Otto opened a few years back
What a shame!!!
It used to be quite good, but now it is overrun with a bridge tunnel crowd and too many students
Service is mediocre at best - and even food has gone downhill
If anyone is used to discriminatory eating arrangements, then this is the place for you! Some seats in the bar you can eat at and others you will get your waiter fired or so you're told (however, if the waiter is as rude as the bartender, then maybe you will want to eat your pizza at a non-eating table
BUT!!! Don't order the mushroom pizza because you will wipe off the mushrooms and cheese sprinkles and just want to eat the good crust
BUt don't be alarmed if all else fails the ice cream and extensive wine list is fantastic
maybe because it is not made there
In fact for a day-to-day favorite, Otto would it
The food is exceptional, the wine list is excellent and the service is great for the type of restaurant this is
To clarify, this is an inexpensive restaurant owned by a celebrity chef, so expect it to be crowded and don't expect to linger at your table for hours on end
Having siad that, I highly recommend Otto
The proscuitto is by far my favorite in the U
S
The wine selection is enormous and very well chosen, with numeroous bottles availale for under $40-$50
You can't go wrong here
seated politely promptly
nice bar, open kitchen beautiful
pizzas/pastas are $9, most places charge way more, this place could too
food arrived fast
pasta was outstanding, pizzas very good
small appetizers tasty $4 each! service
be real, youre not gonna get 3star service for $9!!! its a casual restaurant, hello! waiter was not always around, busser was
people complaining they were 'rushed'
we weren't, but we didnt milk it
if you know about restaurants, you know at $9 a plate, they cant afford you to blab over coffee when people are waiting for your table
just a fact, get over it
theyre paying 5thAve rent, so get real, enjoy your food and move to the bar if you want to 'linger'
great food, incredible value, great location, famous chef
we got what we paid for and more since we didnt pay too much for pasta pizza antipasta
thanks OTTO!!!
While Mario Batali is true to the food of Italy he is not true to the Italian culture as foar as letting you linger to enjoy your meal
His staff is trained to move you out as soon as possible to turn the table
We were not allowed to order appetizers first and then our meal, we had to order everything at once
I was still eating and someone tried to take my dish away
We spent $250 for wine and pizza for 4 people and they rushed us out in an hour and a half
When we didn't respond to the waiter's not so subtle hints to move it along he sent the manager over to get us out
I will never go back to a Batali restaurant again
The molasses from which their selection of rum is derived runs faster than the service at this atrocity of modern dining
Calling this LACKLUSTER would be insufficient- implying perhaps that while there once was luster, it has given way to a temporary dullness- in fact, the space lacks the vitality of even the nearby sbarro pizzeria
I cannot decide what was more insulting
The affected slurring of our waiter, his lack of attention (surpassed only by his lack of knowledge), or the way he rattled off ingredients with the dexterity of a TGI Friday's busboy
The bathroom was revolting and populated by a hostess picking up soiled papertowels and crowding the sink area such that it was impossible to wash one's hands
And the brilliant visionaries behind the soundtrack (subtle heavy metal), should be impaled
Will never return
Batali, you are the bane of the New York City culinary arena
My pasta was crunchy
The waiter condescendingly told me it was supposed to be al dente
My companion's pasta was al dente, mine was maybe dunked in hot water for 30 seconds
I've been to Lupa and Babbo and this place does not compare
Sure, it's cheaper but the waiter acted like he was working at the fanciest restaurant in the world and treated customers like they were country bumpkins who knew nothing
The antipasti was not bad
If you have to try this place, avoid the pasta and hope you don't get the same waiter
I've been to Otto several times now, and the food is very good (especially the gelato)
However, it is a horrible place to take guests from out of town, because they service is bad and the experience is very rushed
I'm sure that the rate at which they crank people through there makes for especially grumpy waiters, but nearly every time I've gone the staff has been rude and rushed

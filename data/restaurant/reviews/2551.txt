The pasta is good and inexpensive, and the desserts are yummy!
The previous reviewer is nuts
Yeah, let's have yet another Latino restaurant in an already over saturated area
This is a great place to eat
The staff was attentive and pleasant
Food was great for the price (try the steak kabob!)
There aren't too many nice place to sit down and eat in this area, but this place all but makes up for that
George's Pizza is the best in the city! When you come to George's he treats you like family
As the neighborhood has changed through the years, George has held the block together delivering the best slices everyday
As for the ambiance, it can't be beat
Where else can you see posters of hot blonde greek girls holding large greasy pitas full of gyro meat
There are also framed pictures of george in his early years and the Village Voice write up for top 100 best pizzia places in New York
If you're not from the neighborhood, its well worth the trip up to 181st st one block from the A train
At George's, George makes the pizza
Good luck finding the original Joe, Ray, or John at their pizza places
Long live George's!
I've been a customer for over a decade+ and never have a problem w/doing the 1 mile trip from my apt to George's for a ravioli, chicken parm
, or for one of his fantastic garlic knots
This Mexican restaurant shames a great cuisine by taking its name
The Chile Relleno here is not the expected hot poblano pepper stuffed with spiced meat and cheese
Instead it is a frozen dinner imported from *who knows where* that they have trouble serving even fully thawed
It is not just that the cuisine is NOT Mexican, it is more that the food is NOT even good, regardless of what name they give it
Pizza Haven is another example of New York's superiority in pizza/Italian dishes, a great local pizzaria!
Walked by this place for years assuming it was no different from all the other take-out joints
but when I heard otherwise and got around to trying it was very pleased
Haven't gone through much of the menu yet but what I've had has been very fresh and tasty
I highly recommend the Grilled Chicken Breast sandwich
I love authentic Italian and this fit the bill: foccacia bread and wet mozarella cheese
Get it with Sweet Potato Fries and a Chocolate EggCream for the perfect meal
Although you may have to wait about 30 to 45 mins for your pie to be delivered, it is worth the wait! the toppings are plentiful, the crust is is crispy enough, and the dough is chewy but not tough
The guy taking the orders always remembers who we are and is always really nice over the phone
It's a good place to order from if you live north of City College areas
Must try!
On a friend's recommendation, we tried this hole in the wall ivory coast restaurant
We were greeted with a curt What do you want? There didn't appear to be any menus, only a blackboard scrawled with 4 french words
When it became apparent we didn't speak french, our hostess called over the proprietess, who informed me we could choose between the fish stew and the beef in cava
We chose one of each
They were very hearty and delicious!
The Scene Patsy's has been open since 1932, and its coal-fired pizza oven was among New York's first
But the East Harlem pizzeria now feels woefully neglected, and eating in the decor-less dining room can be a depressing experience
Fortunately, Patsy's pizza is one of the few great pies available by the slice, so quick takeout is an option
The Food Patsy's crust is more in the light and crunchy than dark and sooty vein
The tomato sauce is fresh and vibrant and the toppings are top-notch
Mozzarella is reasonably fresh and distributed across the surface of the pie, a la John's
And at $1
50 a slice, it's one of the best values around
No frills , just great pizza
One of the last coal fired ovens in NYC ( the remaining ones were grandfathered in, otherwise they are illegal)
If you're a connoisseur, Patsy's is amust , I haven't missed a week there in years
Hands down the best pie in the city
Can't beat the price
You can park anywhere on the street
Don't bother going anywhere else for pizza
My parents went to Patsy's 50+ years ago when they were dating and we're celebrating their 50th anniversary there tonight
The pizza is like nothing you've ever tasted
Thin crust, not too much sauce, not too much cheese, a throwback to what pizza was meant to be before we started adding pineapple to it (YUCK)
The service at times is awful, at other times is great
It doesn't matter
You're not only going there for the food, you're going for the experience of yesteryear
The regular menu, pasta, etc
, is excellent as well, and don't pass up their chocolate souffle which is to die for! Make the excusion!!!!
Patsys and the people there have been great
I have been going there my whole life
The food is great and the people are down to earth I hope one do to own my own resturant and I want it to be just like patsys
Unlike the editorial reviewer who only said this was average: I wonder where he has been eating, given the declining in pizza quality in recent years; this is one of the 5 top pizzas in the city
Take it from me, I have eaten at most of the others and this is up there
Where else can you get a coal oven slice for a mere $1
50? Try slice, or three, you will not be disappointed
This is the kind of pizza that you have to normally have to buy a pie to get
I've been to Lombardi's, Grimaldi's and John's
Patsy's just beats them flat out
Greatest pizza ever
Make sure you get a plain pie with basil
You'll be in heaven
From a place that was frequented by Sinatra when he was alive, could you expect any less? Feel free to wander in the back area, where they used to have a lounge (they plan to reopen it) to see pictures of Sinatra and other celebrities at this classic pizza joint
Have a few drinks at their newly open bar
And make sure you order the oysters as appetizer
damn those are good
The only drawback? Location
Unless you live up there in the Upper East side, it's a little out of the way
But it's worth the trip
There is NOP OTHER PLACE like Patsy's - the pies are delizioso - well cooked to order and a delight to the taste buds
Prices are very, very reasonable for appetizers that serve more than two quiet easily
No frills


just great coal-oven pizza
A must for ANY NATIVE NEW YORKER


and our visitors as well!!!  Tutti a tavola a mangiare!!!!
Patsy's has the best pizza outside of Naples (the birthplace of pizza)
When Jose gets that coal oven burning, the edges of the thin crust pizza come out slightly charred and crispy
You can't find a better pizza anywhere than the simple tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella - not the shredded stuff you get everywhere else, but large globs of freshly sliced, full flavored mozzarella
Yes, the ambiance is non-existent
But the service is fast, and the pizza unbeatable
Feel free to chat up Victor the waiter - he's a real movie buff! I live in AZ now, and Patsy's is what I miss most! Don't be afraid of the neighborhood - take the subway, the 1st Avenue bus, or a cab
You won't regre it!
This pizza is the best! I almost ate a full pie by myself
Order a soda with your meal and you'll get a 12 oz

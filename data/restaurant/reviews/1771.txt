but clearly a good dining experience and one I will definitely return to in the future
18 years this place and still no1
The whole fish with the lemon, oregano and olive oil taste no one in new york can come close
We are not going to say anything fro this octopus, out of this world!!! The service very good and atmospher very warm
This is the place for realy good food!!!!!
i was looking forward to this restaurant for weeks! we came in a little early but was promptly seated
our appetizers were delicious but our entrees never showed up
the waitress was too busy to notice
i flagged her down after 25 minutes but noticed that she had never put our entree order into the kitchen
after waiting over 45 minutes just for entree, we decided to walk out
there is no way we're going to spend over 150 dollars on such incompetent service
the manager never once came over to apologize
This restaurant is really beautiful and I get the feeling it would be a great place to come for an expensive night out
However, I recently had the restaurant week menu and was definitely not impressed
The appetizer and main course were mediocre, even if the dessert was delicious
So basically, order off the normal menu
First time there and we're fans
The food was fantastic and our waiter was world class
I highly recommend Periyali for the food and ambiance
Only downside, maitre'd with a diva complex
Distasteful memories of eating stuffed vine leaves in Greece as a child have left me with a reluctance to sample too many Greek restaurants
Until now that is
Periyali was an unexpected gem; the decor was tasteful and modern, though I can't imagine plate smashing going down too well
The food on the other most certainly went down nicely; grilled octopus was deliciously tender whilst the much touted salmon in philo was truly delicious
The prices are high, especially when you get stuck into the wine, Greek or otherwise, but it is worth it for such exceptional cooking
This would have to be my favorite restaurant by far and the best Greek Restaurant
WHAT A MEAL
Consistent in it's quality, it offers the most wonderful food of its kind
It is beyond the best Greek restaurant ever in Manhattan!!!!
The Scene The bright mix of colors painted on the cafe's walls matches the vivid margaritas that sit on nearly every table and litter the sceney bar
The strong, fruity concoctions come with punchy flavors like passion fruit, strawberry and blood orange and draw a casual but fashion-forward crowd
The Food This Chelsea favorite is known for its creative Mexican cuisine
The citrus-habanero marinated shrimp atop a mango and corn salsa could benefit from a bit more heat, but otherwise the starter pleases
From the "street food" menu, try the carnitas--the tender organic pork is complimented by tortillas and fresh guacamole--or the reliable burrito
The skillet of shrimp with papaya works as a kind of upscale fajita; its chipotle tomato puree nicely marries the caramelized papaya to the shrimp
The wild mushroom chile relleno gets overwhelmed, however, by its creamy sauce
End with tres leches, imaginatively topped with banana cream
Whenever I am in the Chelsea area for gallery meetings I always make a point to stop by and have dinner or a drink at the Rocking Horse Cafe
I have been going to the Rocking Horse Cafe for the last four years now
They are known for their margaritas but I always try their drink special or have a glass of wine
The tuna dish is to die for and I cannot get enough of their lemon tart dessert
I dream of it sometimes
The nice part of the whole experience is the staff
The staff is friendly, they get it and are always on top of things
I will be back soon
Thanks!
This place has the best guac I've had in the City, and the enchiladas are awesome - instead of the red sauce that usually drowns everything on a plate, their enchiladas have a tangy, delicious, pomegranate sauce that is out of this world!   The waitstaff is all very friendly and helpful too
I definitely recommend it!
Best Huevos Rancheros in town
Chips salsa were exceptional
OJ fresh, just the way we like it
Polite waiters and great atmosphere
I went there a couple of months ago with some friends
As other people have noted, the food is nothing special
I did however like the drinks and the chips
The worst part was that they rushed us through the meal from beginning to end
They started clearing the appetizers away in less then 10 minutes while people were still eating them
We were actually told after an hour and a half that they needed our table and they asked us to leave
We were a large group and everyone ordered an appetizer, main course, dessert, and several rounds of drinks
I am surprised they didnt just give us our meals to go
There are much better restaurants in the price range who appreciate your business
I recommend you go somewhere else
We had dinner here last week
we were seated right away so that was good
The service was adequate
but I think they were more concerned about taking the order quickly to get us in and out
The chips that were brought to the table at the start of the meal were good
But I thought the rest of the meal was ok
I thought the lobster emp
were dry and flavorless
I had the prawn main dish and it was adequate
My wife had a pork dish, but I don't remember anything about it
The food here is delicious and slightly different from the standard Mexican fare! The MARGARITAS ARE GREAT- stick to a regular Margarita, on the rocks and use Silver Tequila! The place is small, quaint and yes, it does get noisy at times - but thats part of its ambience
Have found the staff very accomodating, adjusting our Margarita if we did not like it (we ordered 2 different kinds of Tequila)
All in all, its a great place and I would go for the food! We've never been rushed out of there and that could be because we have ended up at Rocking Horse at non-peak dinner hours
There were 8 of in the group, so we made reservations, but still had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated
No problem though, we just had some drinks at the bar
The bartender was friendly and the drinks were strong
We were eventually seated and got our food
The food was mediocre at best
However, we were rushed through our dinner and as soon as we paid our check we were rushed out the door
Unbelievable! Considering we had been there just under 2 hours and had shelled out over $500, you would think they'd be a little considerate and let us take our time
In any event, we'll never go back to this place
There are much better places to go to in the same price range with better food
Go somewhere where they appreciate their customers
We made reservations because there were 8 of us in the group

Drinks were nice and strong

Food was medicore at best
However, the service was horrendous
We were rushed through our entrees and dessert and as soon as we paid our bill we were rushed out the door
Unbelievable! I understand it was busy, but how about showing a little consideration for a group that just shelled out over $500 in less than 2 hours
This kind of service is inexcusable
We'll never go back
Go somewhere where they appreciate their customers
Nuevo Mexican food and good drinks make this a fun place
A far cry for Tex-Mex fare
Only complaints were the noise level

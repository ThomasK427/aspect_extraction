Try to snag the tables outside in the summer time, the inside is kinda bland and nothing special
If you like a pie, tort, cheesecake or the large variety of cakes
trust me when I tell you that it will make your mouth very happy
My favorite is the chocolate peanut butter with pecans
But you be the judge and give them all a try
For something lighter I go for the pies
The overall experience is recommended and will not disappoint
Whether your coming from Lincoln Center, a Broadway show or the movies
It will be worth the trip
Wanting a quick weekday lunch a friend and I popped into Cafe Mozart
Suffice it to say the apple cinnamon iced tea was the highlight of the meal
The service was pathetically slow (I did overhear excuses being made for the slow kitchen to a nearby table) - by the time I did get my food I had to have it almost immediately boxed to go
The expediter/busser spoke very little English, hardly enough to identify which item off of his tray belonged to you
Painful! If you want a place to have an EXTREMELY relaxed meal the food here is OK, but there are better options in the neighborhood
Overall, a waste of money and time
Don't bother!
I have found my new favorite place to enjoy breafkast
The apple struedel french toast is quickly topping my chart of things I must enjoy to enjoy the rest of my day
Also the music and atmosphere is a wonderful way to start the day
I can't wait until I can sit on the outdoor patio this summer
I had a great dinning experience on Monday night
I ordered the Filet Mignon which was the best Filet Mignon I have ever had
Also, they have 50% off bottle of wine, so I checked the wine list, and was amazed with the wine list
I order bottle of Malbec from Argentina
I had very good dinning experience- live music, great food, good service -in one word everything was perfect
I went 2x this week, Sunday brunch and tuesday night, the service was really bad, the food wasn't worth the wait and a bit cold
Sunday was extremely noisyand it seemed forever before i could get my omelette, as for tuesday the service was just horrible, I wouldn't recommend it
waiters should be reminded they are tipped for their service, the least they can do is be nice!
The food ain't that great - well the coffee and the desserts are worth the try
I had the greatest problems with the staff though - they are in your face regarding tips
One time, I wasn't even done and the waitress was already haggling me as to why I didn't give her tip
It's happened more than once when the staff are up your wazoo about their tips
What makes it even worse is that they have an air of arrogance as they serve you
I say, go to Cafe Lalo instead - better desserts, nicer staff, and nicer decor!
for the elegant, top of the line new york late night sweet, cafe mozart is it
The only issue is the average age (50 by my estimates) and ambience (quiet, stuffy but not romatic)
Focus on anything chocolate or fruit
and creme brulee sent from the Gods
Keep in mind, this is New York and you get what you pay for
hint: this is the best
Regardless of what others wrote about cafe mozart, I had to see for myself, and to my surprise I had a great time
The food was Delicious as well as the desserts, would I recomended? YES! the waitstaff was very nice and the music relaxing, I guess you have to go and try it for yourself, but again, I did have a great time!
I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at Cafe Mozart
I read some negative reviews here, but I'm telling you
IGNORE THEM
The food was great (I recommend the filet mignon), and my waitress was nothing short of enchanting
Amazing service and great food
Had tons of fun last night
I totally recomend this place
cute faces and a nice meal, what more can I ask for? :)
When my roommate is not on a diet, we come here one or two times a week
They have the best canoli--I think because it's kosher
Cafe Mozart is not a kosher restuarant but they have several kosher selections that are really good, in particular the french onion soup, made with vegetable broth, but so rich and flavorful you can't tell the difference
The dinners and appetizers are rich and creative, though the chicken dishes are just ordinary
The walnut crusted salmon is very good
Most of the desserts are good, though I have my favorites
I haven't worked all the way through the menu yet though
Just be careful of the chocolate desserts, they can be very heavy
And we always have good service
Watch out for the bathroom as well--there is a lifesize cardboard cut-out of Mozart which I always mistake for a real person
Dining experience begins with cracked, filthy vinyl tile flooring tables so small close together that you couldn't move
Next, the noise -- my thought was if you like dining in the Port Authority Bus Station on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving
Next, service -- about an hour wait between the salad course the entree
Choice of salad dressings -- either vinaigrette or vinaigrette
Famous desserts -- mass produced available at any City deli -- you know the ones that you see in the windows on 7th Ave! Live classical music starting at 9 -- poor playing on an out of tune piano, which you can't really hear anyway because of the noise
Website photo -- made before the restaurant opened
One good point -- located just off Broadway -- so it's easy to find a taxi for a quick exit
The desserts were expensive and not tasty
I also experienced an absolutely horrendous waittress
I saw a waitress yell at 2 customers for moving a table out a little bit in order to have more seating space
And then the waittress refused to reseat the 2 ladies
It was unbelievable
We came here for the desserts, but the food was superb
I had the fliet mignon which was hand cut, huge, and tender with a peppercorn crust
My wife had the cajun salmon done to perfection
The total bill with a glass of wine and dessert came to $65
00
I recommend this cafe highly especially if you are going to Lincoln Center as it is only a 7 minute walk
We ate outside on a beautiful October night
The service by Sean was excellent as well
A nice cafe to have a quick bite
I would not recommend having a large group here as it can be very noisy
The food is great
The desserts are heavenly
I try to go to the Cafe Mozart whenever I am in the city, finding to be a pretty establishment with delicious food and an endearing atmosphere
On many evenings, they have live piano performances right up until midnight, and are open late into the night for those returning from Lincoln Center or some other event
The service can be lacking at times, but the desserts and overall experience certainly counter this flaw
Some of the claims of bad desserts are very exagerated to say the least
Come and see for yourself!
I stopped in at Cafe Mozart this past weekend to enjoy their famed desserts
Their reputation for having some of the best desserts in the city definitely holds true
The music paired with the coffee and desserts was a perfect way to enjoy an evening
I recommend
great dessert and live music very charming the tuna kabab wes awesome
Great food at a reasonable price
A friendly neighborhood atmosphere
Went on a sunday
Really quaint and cute
Great jazz players
Awesome coffee

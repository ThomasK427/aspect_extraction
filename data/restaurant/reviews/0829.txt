they were so good i didn't get to try anything else
recommend the everything
Nana's has the absolute best cookies!!!!! She has cappuccino cookies with white chocolate chips, oatmeal cookies with raisinettes, chocolate cookies with peanutbutter and chocolate chips, and the ultimate:CARAMEL CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES!!!!!!!! She has other goodies, but the cookies are my favorite, were at least they were, until she introduced her chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting!!!!! IT IS SO GOOD, and it's big!!!! Pricing is awesome, and she has baker's dozen
Only con: the place is a bit small, seems crowded if there are more than 5 people there
This is the place to go for interesting, FRESH and delicious lunch time fare
The prices are the same as a regular deli sandwich, but the end product is just so much better
All the food is made freshly at the specific location and it is antibiotic and hormone free
Im not a huge health nut or anything, so that wasnt the specific draw, but it will make every other sandwich pale in comparison once youve tasted theirs
Please try and Pret, you dont be disappointed
Go for the pork belly
Service is always eh at korean restaurants but must say the bbq is GOOD~  Go with large groups because the portions are big so you can share more dishes!
Very special place
Quiet, Great food, coffee, fast and nice service
Highly recommended
Without a doubt the best breakfast/brunch/lunch eatery, for the lowest price, on the Lower East Side
Great salad, great quiche, amazing paninis--it's all fresh and very tasty
I also go for the coffee and the friendly atomosphere
Small, yellow and very mellow
Probably the last great undiscovered sandwich and salad oasis on the lower east side
Artisnal chicken salad offered on a variety of fresh baked breads elevates the entire genre
a very pretty restaurant on 6th street, the best of the lot in looks as well as food, i loved it
HOME AWAY FROM HOME (ATLEAST THE FOOD)
worth every penny, and with the deals on the bar , you could drink and sing to CURRYoke all night,,,,
if you're in the village remeber you have a choice
i love trying new restaurants, but of course there is always that risk of dissapointment
the decor is beautiful, buts sincerely that is all it has to offer
after you taste the food, you can't help but feel you went somewhere else instead
I've been to GOA about 5 times in the past year
It's one of the few places my girlfriend and I agree on
It's clean, great decor and good food
The service leaves something to be desired at times, depending on who's working but overall it's a good place to be
Goa is clearly looking beyond the area's typical Indian restaurant, and when it opened that was reflected in the prices
They now have a 50% discount for parties of four and over, however, making it a phenomenal value
The food is delicious, without a doubt
The servers can be agonizingly slow and inattentive, but they're very pleasant - once you find them
Overall, much better than the street's Indian restaurants, less expensive, more food, and better quality than Baluchi's
I would definitely recommend it
they should be in midtown too, for the standards they maintain they should really consider going uptown
I came to Goa with a big group of my friends (12 of us) before going out for a birthday party
The birthday boy was really impressed with the place
He usually prefers Baluchi's and hates all of curry row, but now says Goa is a great option
The food is served very high quality, and not too greasy
SERVICE should be worked on a little however! Ambience excellent
I only wish I could afford the seafood dishes
My boss asked me to select an Indian restaurant where we could take an important business associate to dinner
After reading the reviews I suggested Goa
What an EMBARRASSMENT service was non existent
No greeting/smile, we had to request a menu to place an order, the meal was served sparingly and took a very long time to arrive, when it did finally arrive some dishes had cooled whilst others were piping hot, and to top it they made an error on the final check
Our clients were horrified and remarked hope this is not a reflection on the way you intend to do business with us
We have since taken our clients to restaurants that take pride in serving their customers
inconsistant food quality and aweful service
You might be better off in a self service place
I'm actually from the Indian state of Goa
So, accordingly, I came to Goa, expecting to taste my home
Sure enough, the dishes I tried were genuinely Goan
They also had some other dishes, which I'm not sure were Goan, but they were definitely delicious
Besides Brick Lane, this is the only restaraunt I eat at anymore on the street
Good value for the quality of food too
My college club now caters from Goa and the members love it
PHENOMENAL FOOD
GREAT AURA AND A SPIRITUAL AMBIENCE
PERFECT VALUE FOR FOR MY WALLET
CHEF SATI AND THE TEAM WERE AN OUTSTANDING HOST AND MADE MY VISIT TO NYC A MEMORABLE ONE
A MUST VISIT JOINT
I've been going to Goa for about a year now
This is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to
It's a pleasant surprise given the sameness of other restaurants on Indian row
You can taste the freshness of the seafood
You're not going to find any oily sauces or overly hot food that takes away the flavor
Anything that comes from the grill is delicious (take a look at the appetizers)
The decor is tasteful too and has a cozy ambiance
I found service staff friendly and helpful and they even join you on Friday nights in a fun karaoke session
Worth a visit - I know I'll keep coming back for more
I loved the decor, which is one of the reasons I stepped in
What a DISSAPOINTMENT
Firstly, there was no-one to greet us and show us to the table, we waited at the door for 10mins, then they forgot one of the items on our order
the food was overpriced, given i could've purchased the same meal at half the price next door
I won't be going back for a goan curry in a hurry
I took my wife out to this place for dinner yesterday
The ambiance is nice but the rest of the experience left me feeling robbed
The food was oily and badly cooked, and to top it all, they served the bread 10 minutes after they served the food
Service is non existent, the waiter was dismissive when I complained
Will never go there again
Brick Lane catered our wedding in July and both the food and the service were fantastic
Our guests were raving and continue to rave about the food
Raj and Sati were incredibly helpful in assisting us as we chose the menu and throughout the process, they were responsive, proactive, upfront and understanding
We're not sure where some of these other reviews are coming from
We highly recommend Brick Lane - both their restaurant and their catering service
This restaurant has the perfect setup and the worst execution
A good seating plan with uncomfortable chairs, a great menu that ends up in very poor dishes and very friendly staff -- if you can find anyone
Brick Lane Curry House could have been a contender if it just took a look at itself in the mirror and had the courage to acknowledge what it saw
I still recommend this for vegetarians
There is a plenty of food and if you can order it properly you can actually get out satisfied
Beware of the americanized giant cauliflower and zucchini pieces that seems to have become the de-facto standard of wannabe Indian bistros around town
The food is hot without being spicy
Chillies are used for a short-term goal without the concept of a flavor in mind
curries spice and great authentic aroma from appetizer to entree
here you can have goat and panner as well
waiting time is a bit long during peak hours, so be prepare or reserve at opentable ahead of time
the atmosphere is very romantic and great for couples and small groups

It just doesn't make sense
But for groups, this place is perfect! he food is meant to be shared, with heaping, family-style portions
It is always crowded, so make reservations, and tell your group to arrve on time since they won't seat incomplete parties

Anyone who knows good italian will find this place exactly what it is
A tourist trap
Big portions but not all it's cracked up to be
my friends and i greatly enjoyed our time at carmines
we loved the calamaris! i highly recommend this place
I went there recently since so many people were raving about this place, but I found the food to be very salty
We ordered 4 dishes and 3 of the 4 dishes were way too salty
On top of that, our waiter was such a jerk
Very arrogant, rude, and horrid service
I complained to the management and they were very unsympathic
They don't take reservations and it took us over an hour to get seated
I went there with a large group and everyone was raving about how delicious it was
but I found it to be SO SALTY to the point where I am still thirsty 13 hours after I ate
They're a little touristy and gimmicky but it is, indeed, pretty neat inside
They brought a basket of breads over, and all of the bread was cold and they didn't bring any olive oil or butter
How hard is it to heat the bread up in the oven beforehand? It makes it taste much better and fresher
The atmosphere is pretty neat, the seafood is fresh, but overall I'd say skip it and hop on a cab to Little Italy
This restaurant is great for group dining
Although it can be hard to make reservations sometimes and making sure that you're whole party will show up, it's worth the hassle
Great for pre-theatre dining or just dining in general
For couples, order a light appetizer and 1 entree, it will be more than enough
Sometimes our eyes are larger than our stomachs!
It was a little expensive, but the food was great
Very generous portions so don't order too much
Reservations are highly recommended
I was running late with my girlfriend and I called in
They honored the call and noted it and had a table waiting for me
The service was good, the experience was good
You have to go there, even if it is just once
My wife and I went there for dinner and the food was fantastic
The prices vary ($20+)but each dinner may feed 2-6 people
We shared the Carmine's Salad which was delicious, and ordered Chicken Cutlet Parm along with Shrimp Parm
and needless to say we took home a doggy bag
If you want pasta under your entree it will cost you additional money but the portion size is huge
Good desserts
Great value, great food, service was good
Reservations a must
If you're going after 4PM you may have a long wait, but well worth it
food was average,too much garlic and way over-priced
portions are big but not for the price your payimg
Been here several times and the same reoccuring themes take place almost everytime: great service, huge portions, sub-par food
Because of portion-price ratio, you will probably get your money's worth
The lasagna is the size of a cantalope, the calamari comes in a plate that is big enough to easily feed a party of 6 or more, the pasta is always abundant, almost pot-luck like
This is not the place you want to visit for the best Italian in the city, but probably a good place to feed a group of people family style at an affordble price
Went recently based on an internet recommendation for best spaghetti meatballs
I ate at the bar and it was delicious food and friendly people
Only thing is, each dish serves 3-4, even appetizers, so you must take it home
Not designed for solo travelers who don't have a fridge
Otherwise, highly recommend the quality of food for the money
If you have someone coming in from out of town who loves Italian food, this is the place to go
I brought my girlfriend's family here and they just loved it
Huge portions of delcious food, loaded in garlic
And don't forget the Titantic before you leave - there is nothing quite like ending a huge meal with a flourless chocolate cake
Very friendly and patient waitstaff
Just make sure you make reservations, or you'll never get in
just because the portions are big, doesn't mean the food is good
Gave it two tries, will never go again
Food is great! Very large portions-best with a large group
Will only take Saturday reservations with a large group
Meals are served family-style: difficult for couples to order
Carmine's is probably one of those love it or hate it places
I find it to be a very good example of a restaurant that doesn't pretend to be something it's not
There are certainly much worse places to eat great Italian food in the Midtown area
The food is great
You will see many items you are familiar with like lasagna, ravioli, and manicotti
The sauces are very rich and delicious
As many people state, the portions are amazingly huge
Two entrees for a party of four is plenty
The selection is large
The atmosphere is so-so
It's a massive, open room with closely-packed tables
It can get quite loud during the dinner rush, but not annoyingly so
It's not a great place for a romantic dinner, but families and groups of people out to have a good time will certainly find it enjoyable
This place is so warm and festive
Portions are huge and everything is delicious
Get the chicken pasta and save room for the huge desserts
Everything can be shared and you will definitely be full
Prices are reasonable as well
We have never had a bad experience at Carmine's- only good food, excellent service and a lot of fun
Carmine's is boisterous and friendly, and a family of five can eat there for under $80
00
Considering that you can easily spend that much at TGI Fridays and have a miserable dining experience, Carmine's comes very higly recommended
The wait staff is very knowledgeable and helpful
You should definitely make a reservation well in advance or be prepared to wait for an hour, but the bar area is friendly, and we have always been seated within the estimated wait time
Carmine's is great for families and groups
After hearing New Yorkers rave for years about this NYC tourist trap I finally had to see for myself if it could truly live up to all the hype
Well it doesn't
The food was mediocre at best, in fact the pasta dish was so over salted that we couldn't even eat it
If you want truly amazing Italian try Pheasant or Petrosino and save the tourist trap for the tourists
Thank you for making our day perfect by ending it with a wonderful dinner service
even during the GOP convention
(09/01/04) and   Make your dining experience stress free worth every minute, Make Reservations
and Enjoy!!!!!!!  Joanne
My wife I went to Carmine's Midtown after a 8pm Broadway show
Even at 11pm or so the place was packed
The service was simply average, but the food was tremendous! The fact the food was superior and terrific allowed us to forget the service issues(waited for water, served wine in a small non-wine glass)! It was noisy, but that did not bother us

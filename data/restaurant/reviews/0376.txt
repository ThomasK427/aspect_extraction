and the value is superb
Went with my husband on a Saturday evening during the prix fix hours of 5-7
We both had the salad which had a very flavorful dressing
I opted for the beef tenderloin which was an extra $5 but so worth it
It melted in my mouth and the sauce and side of scallion mashed potatoes and asparagus was delicious! My husband had the herbed chicken with mushroom risotto and he liked it too
For dessert we had the cappucino cake which was really tiramisu
The coffee needed some help but can't complain since it's included in the prix fix price which is an amazing deal! Highly recommended!
I went to Salmon River with my family last Tuesday for a late lunch to celebrate my graduation from college
I had the Wild King Salmon which was amazing, and the Chilean Sea Bass and the Black Sea Bass also got rave reviews
The service was fantastic, our waiter was attentive and prompt
I had a nice glass of pinot grigio with my dinner
For dessert the Capuccino Cake was excellent
I definitely recommend this restaurant, great value, great food
A friend and I recently had dinner at Salmon River while visiting New York
It was a Wednesday evening and only moderately crowded
The room is quite small, but we had a nice corner table and lots of privacy
The service is fair - not quite attentive enough - but not bad
The food was good - bassil chicken for me, salmon for him
Reasonably priced - one appetizer (good calamari) with plenty to share, two entrees and wine for a little more than $50
00
we went for the prix fixe 3 course menu
the ambience is very elegant and the food was really tasty
all for 20$, this is a fantastic value
Went there for a romantic dinner for my girlfriend's birthday - both of us could not have been more pleased
She had the sea bass special, I had the halibut, both tremendously delicious
The ambiance is fantastic, the service exceptional
I will definitely go back for more nights to remember!
I went b/c my boyfriend and I had a coupon for a free bottle of wine
I'll go back because of how amazing it was
We went on a Saturday night, and had NO trouble getting a table as their busy time is during the week
Waiter was attentive, we had the corner booth that was wonderful, and great food
Cute space, good food, great value
I'll be back!
This would be the best fish restaurant in some (small, landlocked) places, but not in the big city
The fish itself was good, but sides and apps ranged from fair to downright terrible
The service was amateurish and inattentive
The room is nice enough, but if you don't like cigarette smoke, wait for the ban
Upon arrival we were stuck for 10 minutes behind a large group of 17 with no host/hostess in site
We sat 15 minutes before someone took our drink order
When our white wine arrived, it was warm, and badly presented
The waiter actually seemed annoyed when asked to put it on ice
The smoke from the bar infiltrated the restaurant area and made it an unpleasant dining experience
It's a pity when a place that has decent food gets everything else wrong
My wife and I just stumbled on to this place and now we are regulars
Great fresh seafood, reasonable prices and friendly, efficient service
Lots of choices on the menu is lots of price ranges
You can celebrate important occasions here or just grab a salmon burger at lunch
I love this place
I was entertaining clients in midtown the other day and I would not consider going anywhere else for seafood
Everyone else in my office feels the same way
The bar is really cool
The food at salmon river blows away tbig name competitor like Docks an the Oyster Bar and the prices are much lower
This is going to be a very successful Restaurant
from the moment I entered i knew I was in for something special
what a soothing and comfortable place to be
I was greated by a friendly waiter, and ordered a delicious glass of chardonay andstarted to look over the wonderful menu
I decided on asian seafood dumplings and a terrific sounding fresh grilled salmon with whipped potatoes and asparagus
It was great, eveything tasted perfect
When the bill came, I couldnt believe I had such an amazing meal for such a reasonable price
I cant wait to go back
I must tell you that Salmon River has exceeded my expectations
We were recommended the restaurant by some friends who frequent it
But, they did not effectively let me know why they go back there so often
The fish was of utmost quality, fresh and pristine
I'd say it could easily pass for a three or four star caliber meal
I had some pink snapper from Hawaii that was superb
My friend had the atlantic cod and she said the flavors exploded in her mouth
And we did not wait to sit down either
What a relief
Not a pretentious place at all
Heard many goods things about Salmon River and they were all true
A truly great find
Great selection of interesting fish varieties from all over prepared in interesting ways
I definitely recommend this place
Very reasonably priced seafood, too
Was in the area the other day and needed a place to stop in and grab a quick bite
My girlfriend and I sat at the bar, ordered two glasses of wine, and split a burger
Both the food and service were outstanding, and the price was exceptionally reasonable
Our burger was cooked exactly how we asked and the meat was fresh and of high quality
As scary as it is, $10 is a great deal these days for a good burger at a nice restaurant
The rest of the items on the menu looked very tempting, and the ambiance was nice, so we will be heading back for a real dinner in the near future! I have a very good vibe from this place
I don't understand what the hype is about this restaurant
It was my night to choose a new restaurant in which to dine with my friends, and so I picked Salmon River
The menu loked good and it sounded like a great place
However, I was highly dissappointed at my actual experience
The food was very plain and bland
The service was the absolute worst I've ever had
Don't go to Salmon River! You will regret it!
Food: Bland and unoriginal, despite the creative writing in their menu
Service: Need new management
was out of water for 1/2 the meal, salad was never delivered, waitress never came by to see how our party was doing
Ambience: Cheezy lite-jazz playing, gnats on walls and mirror, dirty floor and baseboards
makes me wonder what's behind the kitchen door
Overall: Will never set foot in there again!
This place was excellent in every way - from the appetizers to dessert
I can't find anything to complain about
The crab cakes were really good
The salmon and cod entrees were flavorful
The warm pear tart was heavenly
The service was prompt

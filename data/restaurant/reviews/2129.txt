i've tried em all and I love them
but the place does get crowded, making it difficult to get second the bread (and ull want them)
it's not cheap, but it's worth it, esp when there are so many place in nyc that serve mediocre food at similar prices
I recently decided to eat only free-range chicken and vegetarian foods
Josie's has it and, oh, it's good
The food is original and tasty, not like you'd expect your vegetables to be
I'm surprised at all the negative reviews about the service
We went on a friday night at 6pm
We called ahead to make reservations as suggested, but it was not necessary
We were immediatly seated and given bread to start
The pineapple calamari is the best I've ever had
I would go back just for that
My only complaint was the drink
It was too strong and not very tasty for a cocktail
But still, I recommend Josie's
Amazing and healthy! Sueshi is expensive but then again its not a Japenese place
Overall, great food, great drinks and great atmosphere
Can be pricey
People complain about service, but I found it to be fine
the food more than made iup for it
DO NOT eat here unless you have ample time to waste waiting for your meal
I brought a large party here for lunch recently
We were neglected by the wait staff, none of our meals were brought out at the same time, and one of our party was brought the wrong meal--TWICE
We approached the host and manager politely after the meal but only received a simple and insincere Sorry
Clearly they have no regard for their customers, nor interest in having you return to dine again
I went with two of my friends
We were seated promptly, and then proceeded to wait almost twenty minutes for a server to acknowledge our presence
Servers were hurriedly running around the restaurant, but no one even saw us
When I explained to the hostess that we had been seated for 20 minutes without anyonen even bringing us water, the hostess responded that it normally takes about 20 minutes before a server comes along
That's just plain ridiculous
For as busy as this place is, the owner could afford to hire additional servers
The food is good but unless you make some noise, no one will help you
I was disappointed by the service at Josie's
The hostess was rude, noting that I couldn't be seated until my entire party had arrived (not uncommon in NY) and I couldn't make a reservation in person for when my party did arrive because reservations had to be made more than an hour in advance
Also, they don't accept reservations after 7:30
When I told the hostess this was a confusing policy, she suggested I call ahead, and have it explained to me
I could overlook service if the food was worth the money--but it wasn't
The menu sounds good but is basically uninspired
My $17 hamburger didn't taste any better than the ones I get from my neighborhood diner for half the price
If you're looking for quality food and great ambience in Murray Hill, Josie's is THE place to go
Now with their full sushi menu, I can actually eat there 2-3 times a week and feel like I'm getting something totally different each time
Their menu has so much to choose from and the portions are great
The Thai shrimp roll, blackbean dumplings are great to start off with but my all time favorites are the josie's combo plate with tamari brown rice YUMMM! and their burgers are all delicious
The decor is clean and modern, a great place to hang out after work and even for a nice romantic date
Don't forget to order the lemon ribbon pie for dessert!!
thanks to my incredibly amazing vegan waitress, amy, my friend, who is vegan and i, a meat eater, had a fantastic experience at josie's
she was really knowledgable about the food and made recomendations that were right on the money
(not to mention she was super foxy!)(check out the tatoo on her neck!) most definitely check out the sushi, and their grilled fish
and for the vegetarians out their, try the potato dumplings
delicious!
Josie's was a pleasant surprise
The food on the menu is actually healthy and all tasted very fresh
May not have the super service you will find at some ultra exclusive expensive restaurants, but for the prices you get what you pay for and can feel good instead of guilty after eating out
Menu is diverse enough to find something even if you aren't vegetarian or don't focus on healthy eating
located in prime murray hill, i suppose i would expect nothing less than attitude from girls my own age, but had been there a while ago and wanted to see it again
no thanks
while the food is delicious (slightly over priced for chicken on a bed of greens makrel rolled up in rice


) i would prefer to eat tacos from a stand in the west village than have the host first shoo us away till our entire party arrived (while the restaurant remained empty) and then stand there while our whole party waited until she finally said, would you like to be seated

now? for better salads dishes, try SUPPER on 2nd b/w A-B
I'm surprised by the slew of bad reviews, because my boyfriend and I love this restaurant and frequently recommend it to visitors who want to have a healthy meal in a restaurant with a nice ambience and which isn't expensive
Perhaps people who prefer rich or spicy food wouldn't like Josie's, but the food IS tasty and you don't feel horrible afterwards
My boyfriend, who is definitely not a vegetarian, loves the chicken dish here, and I almost always get the stir fry
We have also never had bad service here
They may be a little slow, but not to the point that I was annoyed
I only wish they gave bigger appetizer portions, because the calamari and shrimp are yummy!
What fun I had at this healthful eatery! My sexy server, Peter, was helpful in my deciphering their diverse, ecclectic menu
The sushi is phenomenal! Don't be fooled by all the tofu and soy beans, the seafood is sensational! Go now!
A friend wanted to eat at this one
The staff was polite, but amazingly slow considering that the place was half empty
When the salad finally arrived it was fine, a mix of fresh greens
The entree, however, had more in common with the food at my college dorm cafeteria than that of other restaurants in the price range
Not worth it at half the price
Sure the place look great and trendy, but the food is lacking
The food is pricey for that type of quality
The place can get really loud, so expect to lose your voice by the end of the night
Pretty restaurant, good pre-meal bread
Food quality not that great for the price
Not a huge menu selection
Acoustics weren't too great
unless your idea of romance is shouting over the noise of the 3rd avenue traffic near the midtown tunnel while choking on the fumes from the buses which stop right outside the restaurant, don't take a date here
even if you sit inside the restaurant instead of at an outdoor table, they keep the doors open to ensure that we all get to enjoy the pleasures of 3rd avenue road rage and m103 fumes
the menu is limited, with only a few choices per food category (chicken, beef, fish, vegetarian, etc
) and very expensive for what you get
we got there at least 15 mins before another party yet their order was taken first
finally, i decided to order a cake to go
when i got home, my $6
50 tiny slice of cake wasn't even the one i had ordered
whatever it was tasted like a cold grilled cheese sandwich
I had been to Josie's numerous time because of their health-conscious menu, and their (usually) decent service
But on one occassion I was so disappointed at how terribly they treated my party, that I will never go there again
The waitress got an order wrong, and instead of fixing the mix-up, she decided to ignore us and wait on other tables
We got the manager's attention, but he didnt do anything either
The waitress blamed the kitchen, the manager blamed the waitress, but no one fixed the situation
By the time something was done, all our food was cold and our appetite was totally lost
We didnt eat a thing and asked for our check
Our waitress didnt even notice that our food had not been touched
I was so disappointed, because I had thought Josies was an OK place, but from that experience, I will never dine there agian

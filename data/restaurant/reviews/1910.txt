Had such big expectations of Raoul's from a friend
Seated next to the fishtank (6 inches - nice headache
)
Boring service
Everything Overpriced
Oysters and Crabcakes were very good
The entrees were not
My Steak au Poivre was supposed to be Med-Rare and turned out Well Done (?) and my date's fish (Turbot) was on the drier side
With tip, dinner = $175
whatever
Located in the heart of Soho, Raoul's is a great restaurant for almost any occasion
First and foremost, the food is exceptional
The steak au poivre certainly lives up to its lofty reputation, but it shuoldn't overshadow many of the other delicacies on the menu, such as the crab cakes and the frisee salad
The wine list is terrific, as are the deserts
The ambiance is superb; dreamy and romantic
The waiters are knowldgeable, friendly, and prompt
Our group was approximately one half hour late, and not only did we not lose our table in the garden, but the staff was extremely understanding and patient with us, which was a pleasant surprise given the restaurant's poularity
There are cheaper places to eat in the city, but in the case of Raoul's you more than get what you pay for
I'm not a connesieur of French cuisine, but my girlfriend who has been to Paris enjoyed it
The garden room is quaint and romantic
Walking through the kitchen made me feel like I was Henry Hill
Good service, great wine selection
turbot was absolutely decadent!! perfectly prepared
Service was impeccable -- attentative but not at all intrusive or overbearing -- the perfect match
food arrived quickly and as ordered (and specific requests were made and accomodated)
the food and ambiance is great
the only problem i had was the service
the waiter that was assigned to us was too busy mingling with other people and neglected us for a very long time
i recommended this restaurant to my friends but warned them about the short waiter who neglected us
I made an 8pm reservation for four and found that we were going to be extremely late
We called to see if we could push it back but the Maitre D' said they were completely booked but we could be put on a waiting list when we arrived
Upon arrival at around 9pm, we got absolutely no attitude and the host was extremely gracious
He seated us right away and we proceeded to have a wonderful, fun evening in the garden
Our waiter was great! Food was delicious and the trip through the kitchen is entertaining itself
This place has great ambiance and service!
Food was truly outstanding, as we had been told
atmosphere was charming and very French
The host was very accomodating but the waiter was abysmal
service was very disappointing
Regardless, we'll assume that the lackluster waiter was a fluke and we shall return
Foie Gras was among the best we've had, and we've had some of the best in France
been here about a 20 times over the last 10 years
in all those times i can only remember one TINY problem with our food which was immediately rectified
wine list is outstanding and can have some very pleasant surprises
steak frites, frisee salad, seared foie gras, risotto and rack of lamb are my favorites
insist on the garden for the exotic walk through the kitchen, the romantic atmosphere, and the ability to smoke after dinner
they were out of my favorite port last time i was there, but they will probably have it next time!
We had a rowdy party of 12, which grew to about 22 toward the end of our evening
Management provided us the rear (more romantic) part of the restaurant to accomodate such a large group from the start
They got the order right, food was fantastic, service was ever-present (I think we has at least two waiters assigned to our table)
Dance music toward the latter part of the evening, even the staff, it seemed, want to get in on our good times
While the food and ambience are wonderful, I am annoyed by the policy that you must confirm your reservation the day of, or they will cancel it
I just tried to confirm 24 hours in advance, which is acceptable to most restaurants, and they said I had to call back the next day or my reservation would still be cancelled
The Scene Although this trendy Thai eatery burned brightest in the early '90s, it still attracts plenty of foot soldiers of the fashion world
This clientele settles in at the bar for an appealing lineup of infused vodkas, the best of which are the ginger, ginseng and pineapple varieties
The Food Kin Khao serves a generally pleasing brand of free-associative Asian cuisine
Its best efforts include a spicy hot and sour soup with shrimp, straw mushrooms and lemongrass, the sliced sirloin steak with lemongrass sauce and fresh vegetables, and roast duck with red curry, coconut milk and Thai basil
Desserts like ice cream and crepes are tasty and change every night
There is a surprisingly long wine list and an extensive beer selection
This is not the place to have a great time
The food did not meet my expectations at all
Too bad for those who judge restaurants by its look not by its food
I went there for my birthday celebration last year
We had to pay $3 additional for plating and silverware just to eat my own cake
!!! I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone else but those who likes bad expensive tasteless food
This place is sexy, vibrant and trendy--without the prices or attitude
The food is incredible and the service is top-notch
Our drinks were great, food was delicious and the atmosphere was a lot of fun
This is a great date spot
I went to Kin Khao on a date
The atomsphere is very pleasant and romantic
The food was excellent
There was no wait
Casual and trendy
Lots of parking
Worth checking out!
My husband and I have been frequenting this hip but somewhat intimate restaurant for over 4 years now
The food is always top-notch, however, the service can be hit ot miss
They have a great menu (although desserts are somewhat lacking)
I would strongly recommend this place to friends, family and you CitySearch folks! Besides
Kin Khao is located in SOHO next to all your favorite shops!! What could be better than a geat meal after great shopping? Enjoy!
Great ambiance, great food and great service
The red curry salmon was wonderful
Cocktails are strong and good
Great little Thai restaurant in a great neighborhood
Good service and not too pricey
Nice atmosphere with lots of candlelight and exposed brick walls
It also has an open kitchen where you can see them preparing all of their delicious food! Go before 9pm and you probably won't have to wait for a table
It's not right that I eat at Kin Khao as much as I do and not praise it to the world! I have been a regular patron for 5+ years and it is hands down one of the very few restaurants in NYC I go back to regularly
The food is always delicious, the service is fantastic, and the atmosphere and prices are just right
Cocktails are great too and there is always a friendly, low-key crowd
I have never been dissapointed and hope it lasts forever!
I had the fried catfish green mango salad, which is one of my *favorite* dishes of all, and it was so terrible I had to throw it away
First the mango wasn't even green, second, there was no delicious sour tang
I cant begin with this great restaurant without some hesitation
I mean, I dont feel qualified to describe the place when I like almost every dish, especially the salmon in a red curry sauce; or my new summer favorite, a mango salad with sticky rice and avocado
I was just there last week and I should go more often
Great, knowledgable waitstaff and delicious food make this a nice place to dine year around
My only wish for the restaurant is that they open one uptown
I simply love Kin Khao

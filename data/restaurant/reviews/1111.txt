we were a party of 7, no res, but waited only 20 minutes
really accommodating staff, great drinks, awesome food! can't wait to go back!
I've never heard of this place until I went on a date there
The place is amazing, the it's very modern but at the same time not too pretentious
The food was delicious (I got the panang curry) and not pricey at all
The drinks were a little expensive, but well worth their price (deifnitely try the mango mojito)! Our waitress was attentive without being overbearing, and for a 9pm dinner on a Thursday night, we didn't feel rushed at all
I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves thai food with a modern twist!
you get better thai food for your buck at real a thai restaurant
they kept saying 10 minutes even after 45 minutes of waiting
they had coat check - but they make you walk downstairs to check your coat and they charge you 2 dollars!!! if the 2 coat check girls were smart - they would go upstairs and get people's coat and they would make tons of tips! the crowd were NOT HOT!!! this place is a joke!
I loved the atmosphere, I felt like I was in a movie
Food was good, and this place could seat a large party easy
Sexy Lighting, Modern Decor and more than friendly wait staff as well as a bar tender that makes a mean apple martini
The snapper and rib eye steak were to die for
I highly recommend this place
i've been to highline many times for drinks
co-workers said it'd be a good place to bring my friends visiting from la
it was the friday before christmas eve we sat upstairs on the banquettes
when our server accidentally spilled some wine at our table, he cleaned it up offered us another glass right away
nothing spilled on anyone but the manager came over offered dessert as well
the la friends loved it
fun, accommocating staff great food
couldn't have been more accommodating
everyone was so nice
i'm looking forward to going back
i should also mention that the drinks are always amazing
be sure to check out the pool lounge on the weekends
You could get much better Thai food at the hole in the wall Thai place in your neighborhood
I had the ribeye and it was a shame that they ruined that nice peice of meat with their too sweet marinade/glaze
The food tried too hard to be nouveau and in the process gave up the stuff that is great about Thai food
Also, a lot of menu items are fried, even though it does not say so on the menu
The service was not very good- I was with a big group, but if they are going to automatically add 20% tip, they could at least give service worth 10%
The few things that were good- the long boat cocktail and the basil chicken (I heard from a friend about the chicken)
Bottom line- if it weren't in the meatpacking, no one would go there
My friends and I had the most appalling experience of our lives at Highline
We were sitting on the beds on the second floor, when the waiter tripped and knocked over the wine glasses on one of the tables
As a result, one of our friends sweater/shirt/pants/ bag got soaked with red wine
We were caught by surprise that no one from the restaurant apologized
When it was time for us to leave, we politely asked whether the restaurant is willing to expense our friend for her drycleaning bill
If they had said no, we would have dropped it all together, but they had the audacity to accuse one of our friends for swaying her arm, causing him to trip and knock over the glasses! They also added that we perhaps had it happen to get away from paying our bill! Please do yourself a favor and go elsewhere
I went based on a friends recommendation
We were seated immediately w/ reservations on a thursday night that i had made litterally an hour before dining
We had gotten the soft shell crab spring rolls and coconut crusted shrimp
Both were great
The spring rolls came w/ an amazing sauce
The shrimp were good as well but could've used a better sauce
For dinner my date had the Duck and I had some type of lemon grass sirloin
It was one of the most amazing cuts of beef i have ever had
The sauce was amazing
Her duck had a great taste to it, but unfortunately the duck had a lot of fat on the meat
Duck usually has a lot of fat on it, but even for duck our portions seemed to have much more fat than accustomed to
Overall, i really enjoyed this restaurant
Definitely going back
Me and three girlfriends went there for a going away party, and not only did we get a bed on the upper level right away, the staff were smiling and extemely attentive the whole entire time
The drinks were great and inexpensive, and the food was delightful as well
The decor is your typical retro-modern motif; which is easy on the eyes
For Manhattanites like us that are used to pretentious attitudes and expensive tabs, this place is definitely a nice change from the rest of the meatpacking district
Great value for the price-- lunch is an even better value, with entree and appetizer for between $8-10 or so
The only problem is the acoustics; it can get very noisy during busier times
Trendy minimalist decor and purple upholstry
Decent vegetarian selections and fun flavor combinations, especially with the appetizers
The green tea and white chocolate dessert was interesting-- where else can you find a Thai pastry chef at an affordable restaurant? A great lunch date or place to bring an out-of-towner for a mellow meal
I went to Highline on Sunday, July 3 with party of 6 for my birthday
We made a reservation at 7
30, but one of my friend was flying over to NYC and unfortunatelly the plane was late
A hostess was very polite and understandable
She let us sit, order some apptizerer and wait for him to arrive
We had some refreshing drinks (Flip-Flop is the best in my opinion) and a few appetizers which were great
The place was busy, but not crazy
I like the atmosphere there, very relaxing yet exciting
Good crowd, good service and food
We went to dinner for a party of 12
The food and service were excellent
The bill was surprisingly inexpensive considering we each had appetizers, an entree, dessert and drinks (alcoholic and non) we also had 3 rounds of shots for the entire table
I really liked the beef and basil
Will definitely go back again
We went with a group of 10 to Highline - the entire evening was fantastic
The large mojitos, though expensive, made the night start off very well
The food was fantastic, all the appertizers were great (golden chests), as were the main courses
I especially liked the Pad Thai and the Black rice towel (so I guess the noodles were the best)
I would recommend this place and look forward to returning
I just went here with some friends this weekend and we had a great experience
We had drinks (mojitos were delicious and HUGE) on the bouncey ball chairs next to the waterfall downstairs while we waited for a table
It is worth going just for the decor!
We all enjoyed our entrees and the vibe was very trendy but not pretentious, unlike a lot of other Meatpacking restaurants
Will definitely return (a HUGE compliment for me)
My second visit to Highline in a month was fantastic
Our group of 6 had a late reservation and were able to sit on one of the few beds upstairs
We ordered so much food that everyone was able to share
We had lots of drinks and a bottle of wine and our bill was $40/person
You are NOT going to find a better deal in the all too trendy Meatpacking District
I can't wait to go back again and again
probably one of the coolest places in the city
The service was good and the food came super fast
The pool lounge on the bottom floor is SOOO hot
Great date spot! definitely not a place for a large party though
Tasty food, fun ambience and REASONABLY PRICED
Highline doesn't take reservations for under 6 people
With that said, my friend and I were seated on a Friday night within a half hour - not bad at all
Service was OK but other than that, definitely was worth it

sushi bar fills up quick
back dining room small
do try an assortment of appetizers
Time and time again the sheer quality of the food (sushi, skewers, appetizers) has converted people (who were not willing to even try it) to sushi lovers
It's very affordable and open late (except Saturday - standard deal)
The respect can be seen in many Japanese business men dining and chatting with the sushi preparers
Can get crowded but service doesn't suffer
It has dipped a bit since 1997 - the sushi bar has become more generic and I no longer see Keith Hernandez on a regular basis
very friendly staff that was willing to open the bar for a bunch of us
The sake and mixed drinks kept flowing and the karaoke machine seemed to get better through the evening! Nice experience, very nice
can't beat the price and the menu options - great food
especially for lunch
quick delivery and a nice sit-down area
definitely worth the money!
Dining in one of New York's nicest areas (Sutton Place) is often a pleasure
Regent's is exceptional, the meals are always first quality and service is excellent at all times and the price couldn't be more reasonable
The host, Kelley attends every possible customer need
From our first experience with bartender Don (one of NY's best) throughout the evening, we could not have been more pleased
On various occasions the staff has been instrumental in creating an enjoyable experience
Josephine,Edie,Alice,Himan,Carlos and the other members of the floor staff are very personable and therfore if you're dining alone, this is the place to visit
In Short A refrigerated case displays the plastic boxes of freshly made sushi combinations, noodle salads and edamame ready to grab and go
In addition, big bowls of soup, fried dumplings, tempura, teriyaki and other hot dishes can be ordered at the counter, to eat in or take out
The dining room is small and bright, with polished wood and large wraparound windows
A rack of magazines is offered for solo diners
I was delightfully surprised by this place
Hoping just to get a decent bit to eat, I found friendly staff and a nice place to sit down and eat
The California roll was the best I've ever had, fresh and tasty even though pre-made
And the price is unbeatable!
Yes, not great, not Nobu, but for takeout or a quick bite in, this place is OK in my book
The tuna is always fresh and their bento boxes are huge
The tempura is always hot and fresh
The dumplings are not good and the teryiaki sauce is red for some reason, but other than that I like! They also have brown rice and don't charge extra for sauces like spicy mayo like the other sushi place do
A good alternative for a cheap, tasty, fast sushi lunch
Niceties include the home-made ginger ale and very nice dumplings
(Obviously pre-packaged and frozen, but still tasty
) HINT: Don't eat the pre-packed sushi boxes in the refrigerator case, ask them to make your oredr fresh
You'll wait a few minutes - but it will taste MUCH better
(Especially for fish like Salmon and Hamachi (yellow tail))
Big portion and many varieties
Prices are good for those who eat out often
Let's not fool anyone this place can't hold anything to the great Sushi restaurants in NYC but for very fast quick delivery and cheap quality Japanese food you can't go wrong
Also don't dine-in, take-out or call for delivery
Japanese chefs make your sushi right in front of you like it's supposed to be done
The host/waiter is EXTREMELY nice
Try the spicy salmon roll, you won't be disappointed
My husband took me to Solera for this Valentine's Day
The night nearly started off on the wrong foot, as the reservation my husband had made three weeks before was never written in, but luckily they had one table left, and we were seated immediately
We each had the six course tasting menu with wine pairing
I was pleasantly surprised by our waiter's in-depth knowledge of the composition of each dish and wine
Each dish was a wonderful combination of sauces, spices and meats
The tuna was a bit on the bitter side, but all of the other dishes were superb
The service was an A-; very quick to clear dishes and wine glasses, and came back with fresh silverware immediately
Between our two main courses (the tuna and rabbit) there was a distinguishable lull in the otherwise fast-paced service
Overall, an excellent experience was had
There are much better spanish restaurants in town
The food had no taste and the sangria tasted like water
We waited for over 30 min for a table
Had dinner at Solera while visiting, due to some good reviews
Started with a couple of glasses of wine and then moved to the mussels appetizer which was decently sized, but just ok
Dinner was the filet mignon which was also decent
Decor and service in this restaurant are above average but should be, given the price
Overall a dissapointing Spanish restaurant given the price
Even as a visiting tourist, I'm sure you can do better in NYC
At first, finding Solera was like finding a hidden treasure
However, we're NEVER going back
First, we were seated next to a raucous, intoxicated bachelor party of over a dozen people
The three of us were shouting just to hear each other so we informed the manager that their poor behavior was ruining our evening
Then, the group confronted us for complaining about them and one drunk person even spit ice at our guest
We got into a shouting match while the manager stood there watching helplessly
It should never have come to this!!  Another time we were there a waiter spilled a hot red sauce on my husband's white shirt while he was serving the table next to us
They didn't even notice what they had done and then offered a half-assed apology and a bottle of seltzer water to clean the stain
It's just not worth going back!!
I found the service to be extremely RUDE
The waiter was very condescending when we asked his recommendations
To end the night, my friend and I were drinking our last glass of wine and we were asked to leave so they could seat people that were waiting
There is such a thing as being polite and that they weren't
Although the food was decent, the service being so poor is reason enough not to go to this restaurant
I met a few friends in the bar area for Tapas
Although it was pretty empty on a Saturday night, it was a nice atmosphere (perhaps better suited for dates), the food was pretty good, and the white sangria was to die for
The brownstone setting of this restaurant is the first indication of its charm
The menu and wine list are superb and the wait staff was able to provide detail about the dishes
The lobster paella was out-of-this world
I cannot wait to return to this culinary delight!
I cannot believe this is an editor's pick! I had read a couple of positive reviews about Solera and I wanted to try a new tapas/Spanish place
Much to my chagrin, the dining experience fell way below average! Hoe they tried to pass of the chewy grilled octopus drowned in paprika as edible is beyond me
But wait, it gets even better, the mussels were so fishy that I had the server try one since he had a hard time believing that this was true
His face became as contorted as ours did, and we were refunded for this dish
I only wish they would have been generous enough to refund the entire meal! The sangria was sub-par to boot!!!
The Scene Zarela is definitely a good-time place, in no small part because of its eponymous and amicable owner
That the nightly fiesta revolves around some of the best Mexican food in the city makes a visit even more gratifying
The space includes a popular bar area, with a main dining room on the second floor that's less boisterous, but hardly dull
The Food The restaurant's culinary visionary is owner Zarela Martinez, and her main courses include some real rib-stickers, like rich, succulent pork braised in a mole poblano that may have you drinking from the faucet all night
From there, choose the pollo borracho (drunken chicken), a sliced-up chicken braised in tequila, white-wine vinegar, golden raisins and pineapple, or any of the tuna, shrimp or other fish preparations
The dessert roster is surprisingly large and satisfying
Once you go to Zarela, you will never want to head to another Mexican dining spot again and it may become one of your top destinations for frozen drinks too
Reasonably priced, very personable staff and casual atmosphere make this one of my favorite spots to return in NYC
This restaurant is not an ordinary chain Tex-Mex or taco joint
This fare is from Oaxaca, a southern region of Mexico, if I remember correctly
The entrees were unique and delicious
The last time I was there my husband and I chose the three course fixed price menu

For a restaurant this hip and full of so many beautiful people, the food is surprisingly good: I rate the delectable chicken, which is served on an aromatic truffle risotto, and any of the fish dishes
I'd also recommend the seating outside for warm evenings
The street is tree lined, and there are fantastic people watching opportunities
There's usually a bit of a wait to sit outdoors, but well worth it and a good excuse to sample some of the excellent cocktails at the bar!  With food this good, coupled with a thoughtful, decently priced wine list, the only vague moan I can muster is the slightly disinterested service
Extra Virgin is a delight, and I cannot recommend it warmly enough
since the opening, i had eaten here pretty frequently
one night i went with some friends from out-of-town and they brought their kids
they had a special that was served for one or two people
there was some confusion with the order and they brought out these huge dishes for the two kids
the couple we were with thought they were serving one order split for the two kids and the restaurant charged us for two seperate orders
when we spoke with the manager and the waitress all they cared about was that we did not say anything until we saw the bill, but when we thought we were getting free food we had nothing to say
the manager said there was nothing she could do; it was our mistake
aren't managers supposed to be helpful and not petty?
The Halibut is terffic along with the trio of tartar to start! While it is a bit tight in terms of seating inside, the abiance is quite cozy
Contrary to what a few miserable New Yorkers, may say, Extra Virgin is a fun, little up and coming hot spot
Really great food, (Brunch's French Toast, to the new Monte Cristo sandwich, to Dinner's Tortelloni, or even the Hanger Steak Au Poivre) Joey Fortunato's recipes are fabulous
Great ambience
A little tight in the busy moments, but hey
it's NY right? Never had a problem with the Mgr, or host
Actually, (at brunch) the host made sure that we were informed about our seating time, and kept a cool head all while doing like 4 different jobs, but I never saw that he was rude to anyone
He even addressed me by my name on my way out
All in all, be on the watch for one of the west ville's best kept secrets
Plenty of eye candy all around, from celeb sightings, to that obnoxious host
Highly recommended
I made a reservation that was just a couple people over the Pre Fix menu number
The pre fix is $50/person even though the bill would eb about $38 if you ordered app, entree and dessert
We requested from management to avoid the pre fixe and she said they would discuss and call me back
Wen they DID call back, it was to tell me my reservation had been cancelled and another party book
sorry
This was my friend's FAVORITE restaurant (which i stressed to management) and they clearly had no profesisonalism to call me and say no we can not honor tyour request, do you still want the reservation? They just went ahead ad CANCELLED IT
Don't go there and support such terrible treatment!
Have been there a few times for brunch and thought it an ok, if not overpriced, place
Than last Sunday, I walked out before being seatedNEVER had I done that before
The host was obnoxious and would not seat my group-eventhough we had a reservation and waited over a half hour for our table! There are so many good places in NYwhy bother with the mediocre? extra virgin? more like extra rude!
Went there last week for my sis's birthday, on a crowded Saturday night
We were seated immediately
The food was delicious (esp the mushroom risotto) and reasonably priced by NYC standards--three of us had apps, dinner, a bottle of wine, three cocktails and dessert for $150
We had no problem with the service, not overly friendly but effecient
Would definetly go back
THE most disastrous restaurant experience in my 30+ years of living in New York
Service was a sneering, snappy bullying by a slack-jawed out-of-work soap actor that wouldn't pass for acceptable treatment of your pet
My martini, $14 BTW, arrived half empty and my date's cosmo was undrinkably sweet
Upon remarking to our waiter that the service was unacceptable, he smirked and told me then don't come back
Almost forgot the obscene conversation at the table next to us or the loud eazy listening CD playing repeat on the stereo
I did happen to notice a waitress being yelled at by the bartender and felt awful for her
This place wouldn't pass muster in your cheapest Atlantic City casino, much less one of the most beautiful streets in NY
TO CITYSEARCH: please revamp this 9 rating
It can't possibly be accurate
This is the worst restaurant experience I've ever had
I've been here a few of times and usually the food is great - last night however left us a little irked - our appetizers were great - the trouble came with the hangar steak au poivre - there was no poivre - there was hardly any steak - I'd say about 3 onces - and it was cold - I asked for it to be reheated - the host took the plate to the kitchen - it came back drenched in hot balsamic sauce - tasting foul - and from that point on we were ignored by our server and pretty much anyone else except the busboy
No one said sorry - No one said anything
Errors happen in the kitchen - I know that - But the FOH service here is terrible - We paid and left with a vow never to go back
I brought two friends here to celebrate one of their birthdays over brunch
I kindly asked the hostesses if they could help with bringing out cupcakes I bought from Magnolia for a birthday surprise
They have the nerve to charge $5 a person for this (plate charges for bringing something from 'outside') but then forget to tell our waitress so they don't end up bringing it out at all
I had to remind them
If you're charging me $15 for that, the least you can do is remember! They were rude overall that last Sunday
The first time I went I had great service and thought it was a great place to go back to
The food is good
Too bad the attitude is not
Went for brunch on a sunny Sunday afternoon
The brunch menu is pretty standard with good staples like Eggs Benedict, omlettes and is decently priced
My eggs benedict with smoked salmon was great, another table favorite was the baked eggs with spinich and ham
The frittes with fondue sauce was a must try
Service was attentive
The restaurant is kind of small so reservations are a must
Went with a large group which may not have been the best place to go with so many people but they were very accomodating
A great place to people watch and dine on a casual, relaxed Sunday
Despite a very long wait for a table outside, the meal was delicious
The hostess and the servers were very amicable and sweet
The chef ensure my meal was free of all ingredients I am allergic too and the dishes I ordered tasted amazing
The summer drink specials were tasty and creative
Sitting outside on a summer evening in the West Village was the perfect ambiance for a date
Never tried the food, as I was turned away
I made a reservation a week in advance and confirmed it over the phone (to a live person) the day of, stating the exact number of adults and children who would be attending
When I arrived, the very rude hostess insisted that the 4 children pushed us over their reservation limit; while not denying that I had made and confirmed the reservation, after she consulted with management on the phone she refused to serve us
This even though it was 6:30 pm in August, meaning it was almost empty
My well-planned dinner party found itself on the sidewalk, very seriously disrupting the rest of the evening (which had been tightly timed, as I was hosting a house party upstairs for a larger crowd after dinner)
In 16 years in NYC I have never been treated so abysmally
Had a few great meals here - the high point is the service
great, knowledgeable and friendly waitresses; two great and attentive bartenders who play great and unusual music from their ipod playlists
the entire staff works together to make it a great dining experience
Food is good (especially the mushroom stuffed chicken), although they rarely have daily specials or vary the menu so it may not be a place for repeated visits
Another reviewer was right commenting on the skimpy waitress uniforms
management should be more respectful to the staff and female diners
After recommendation from friends, I decided to check it out
I can't believe what a great time we had! The service was impeccable and I, being a picky eater was surprised at how the waitstaff were so knowledgeable with the menu
The food was so amazing, and we left the restaurant very happy with the whole experience
We had a girls night out there and it seemed like many tables had the same idea
I can't wait to go back!
After waiting for 90 minutes, the host gave away our table to a couple who arrived after us
When I asked him about it, he admitted his mistake, said sorry, and kept us waiting another 20 minutes
At least give us a free drink, appetizer, etc! They seem to have an attitude of so what, we'll fill the table anyway and that will catch up with them
I heeded my friend's advice, and checked out Extra Virgin on Friday night
The hostess was gracious, and we were seated within twenty minutes
Our friendly waitress recommended the Fritto Misto; a mouthwatering platter of fried seafood with a zesty dipping sauce, which was perfect
The virgin chicken did not disappoint either, I practically licked the truffle sauce off of my plate
For dessert, we had a decadent warm chocolate cake with raspberry sauce
Overall, the service, food, and experience was everything it should be
However, I would not recommend bringing a date, as he may ogle the scantily clad waitresses in way-too-small, bright yellow frocks

I had the life guard stew once, then, I went back again, and tried the lamb chops
simply terrific!! There is also a refreshing Garden in the back, perfect to have weekday power lunches during the hot spring/ summer days in the City
Certainly, a must go, very charming spot in this beloved town of ours
I brought my fiance here for dinner last night for his birthday
We were seated in the back garden which was quite romantic (front area just okay
) At the start of the meal we had good service but the room quickly filled up and the service worsened as a result (sloooow dinner service, mixed up dishes, empty water glasses, no one checking in to see if we were alright
) We had the pumpkin ravioli and the stuffed chicken and they were both average
I told them it was my fiance's birthday and they brought him a slice of their delicious chocolate cake with a candle (which was nice but then they charged for it which is ok, I guess, but I think a more detail- oriented restaurant would have comp'd it
) I think we had an ok dining experience - unfortunately nothing as spectacular as has been reviewed here
My friends and I were looking for a nice place to eat and have a few drinks on a Saturday night before we went out to the clubs in the Gramercy/Chelsea area
We searched under Citysearch and Zagat's
This place is a find
The food is fabulous (I wish I had two stomachs), and it is reasonable for cost, especially if you are going out afterwards
We had three bottles of wine, and a big meal for six of us for under $35 each
We probably should have stayed there instead of heading to the clubs
We are going back
I think this is a terrific place
I have been here for drinks with friends and dinner with the girls
I then took my boyfriend back for aa few times
A great place to feel like you are wanted
I honestly wanted to stay forever
The chef is obviously knows here stuff and the people here are sweet and honest
Go, eat, drink, and see for yourself
From start to finish clearly the best bang for my money in the neighrborhood
As we entered the restaurant we were greeted with a gracious host, and seated promptly
As soon as we were seated and being famished a complimentary plate of cheese, peppers, and Italian sausage was put on our table
There was bread that seemed like it was just baked, and olives with oil for dipping
The food was impeccable (I suggest the mussels, and the halibut, my boyfriend had the lambchops that had nothing left when he was done)
For dessert the Lava cake satisied my chocolate craving
The people are great, and the manager was sweet
He offerred us a complimentary cocktail with a dish of homemade biscotti to end a great experience
We are going back
All we can say is you need to go and try this new and noteworthy spot
We recommend it for a romantic evening, or a group of friends
The food is absolutely superb, and the service sincere
I have been living in the Gramercy /Chelsea area for over 10 years
I have found my new home away from home
The people who work here are genuine, sincere, and honest
The food is delicious
Whatever these people are doing they ought to patent it
Great place for a few drinks and conversation, dinner with friends, or a romantic meal with my girl
The garden in the back is a strong plus especially in the nice weather
It is enclosed for the winter and heated with a pot belly stove, which makes it sooo romantic
Loved it all

When my now husband asked where I wanted to have our rehershal dinner it was a no-brainer
I have been to the restaurant on more than one occassion since they have opened and to say the food service and ambiance is second-to-none
They took care of all our needs without a question
Every answer was yes and what else could we do for you? I HIGHLY recomend this restaurant to all my friends and family
The only thing better than the food is the service
The owner, Peter, makes you feel right at home and the wait staff is just as friendly and accomodating
One of the best gardens in NYC! Sit and have a drink, no one will rush you out the door
A true find!
I HAD DINNER AT ALEO WITH A DATE
FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END I WAS AMAZED
THE COMBINATION OF FLAVORS WAS SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY
THE PRESENTATION OF THE FOOD WAS PHENOMENAL! I WAS SO IMPRESSED I ASKED TO MEET THE CHEF
TO MY SURPISE, IT WAS PNINA L
PELED FORMERLY OF NISOS IN CHELSEA (ANOTHER FAVORITE OF MINE) AND REALIZED WHY I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THE FOOD
I WAS VERY EXCITED TO SEE THAT THE EXECUTIVE CHEF OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS IS NOW HERE AT ALEO! HER MENU IS NOT ONLY IMPRESSIVE, BUT IT OFFERS A VARIETY TO CHOOSE FROM WITHOUT OVERWHELMING YOU
ASIDE FROM THE AMAZINGF FOOD, THE SERVICE WAS PHENOMENAL
THE WAITERS WERE VERY PROFFESSIONAL, CHARMING AND ACCOMODATING
MY OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS DELIGHTFUL
I JUST FOUND MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT!
I went to the grand opening party and have been back 2X
The food is GREAT the chef is AWSOME and the service is what it should be! They take care of the guest! What a great idea in this economy!!!
The food is fantastic and the award winning chef is superb! The wine list is awsome and has some of my favorite BV Ruffino Wines
I highy recomend this place to everyone!
This is what hospitailty is all about
A warm welcome , a great dinner and a created atmosphere that transports you to a mini vacation
the jazz trio on week end is great
share this restaurant with a special friend
Nice restaurant, with great ambiance
Food is good and personnel is friendly
Go there, you won t regret !
In Short Snag one of the few porch seats, or grab a wooden table inside for a quieter dining experience
Cafe Topsy serves English fare like Sheperd's Pie, as well as twists on American favorites
The B
L
A
T
sneaks avocado into the traditional sandwich
The thick "chips" (actually, french fries) are favorites
Ten on-tap beers are available from the bar, with glasses of Hefeweizen tall enough to loosen up a lightweight
Topsy does English food the right way
Try the lamb or a stew and have a Guiness
The decor is well appointed
The atmosphere is laid-back
The service is typically quick and friendly
This is a good place to go for a one-on-one date or perhaps a party of three
exceptionally bad service
as if the waiter learned how to badly service customer in school and applied it to his work
perhaps he's the valedictorian of that class
anyways, the waiter was rude, throwing utensils and chopsticks around as if he hates to serve
miscalculated the check, didn't even say thank you while we walked out
food also sucks
its oily expensive chinese food which i can microwave at home for a fraction of the price!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!
In Short This Chinese restaurant has proven so popular, it's spawned multiple outposts, this one in Murray Hill
Decor varies from location to location, with photos of Mao Tse-Tung making occasional appearances
Menus also vary, though most break down into Sichuan, Hunan, and "American Chinese Food" sections

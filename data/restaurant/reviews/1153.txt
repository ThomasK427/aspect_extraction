The restaurant is dimly lit which creates a very warm atmosphere
at the same time the floor is very open and the staff is kind and attentive
It's a great place to share a nice meal with friends, impress colleagues, or have a romantic dinner with a significant other
The menu includes the best Japanese dishes that will make you feel satisfied, warm and healthy inside, instead of feeling over-full and uncomfortable
I recommend ordering a variety of the cold and warm dishes as well as the impeccable tofu dishes and not necessarily the sushi which you can get at any other Japanese restaurant
Happy Healthy Eating!
The bar was nice, moody, has these floor to ceiling window
We were seated in the main dining room, and it is this 2 story atrium like space at the communal table that boast a sand garden and voltives
Their specialty is fresh warm tofu
How they serve it, is with a box container, which you spoon to your bowl then add this soysauce type sauce a rustic wooden spoon you eat the fresh creamy tofu
The Grilled Churo Toro, which was fresh, and the sauce tangy/salty
Their Yuba with Freshwater Eel was simply delicious, it contains cheese the crispy layer of fried Yuba! We then received our delicious Miso Cod, our Sauteed Braised Duck
For dessert we shared a Tofu Mousse, which was devine in that sweet sauce
We enjoyed the dinner will come back!
The food is amazing but the portions are small
Try the Mochi Croquette (Duck with potato)
For dessert, I don't remember the name I think it was a flourless chocolate cake (first on the dessert menu), it was amazing
The waitress was not so friendly, perhaps it was just her
My husband and I went to EN and thought the restaurant decor was perfect for a Japaneese restaurant
It was a very Zen like feel when you walk in
The food was incredible and the menu was very different, but interesting
If you go to EN, try the Shrimp Fritters and I promise you won't be dissapointed!   Great experience and we look forward to going back!!!!
Tries to be creative but is really average
The $38 wagyu steak is supposed to melt in your mouth but is rubbery and skimpy
The room is like a giant ampitheater and is good for gazing at all the other beautiful people dining with you (be prepared to share a communal table if you are a party of 2), but is very loud and tries to be overly trendy
Good for groups but if you're looking for a romantic dinner for 2, go elsewhere
Overall average, overpriced, and tries to hard
Irrashaimase! caught me off guard, but so did the food
Started with the Warm Tofu (Definitely a MUST TRY), Crispy shrimp fritters, and a tuna avocado salad
Our second dish I had the mochi croquette, and chicken sausage for her
Our main course stone grill wagyu steak, an amazing dish to be served and berkshire porkbelly
Both of these dishes were superb, but the steak was a bit small for the price
For dessert we split a tofu mousse, which if no one had told me, I would've never guessed it to be tofu
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's dying to try something different from the typical sushi, noodles, and terriyaki
If not for the food, definitely go for the experience of sitting inside the dining room
I made a reservation over a month ago and even received two follow up phone calls to confirm the reservation
When we got to the restaurant, there was no record of our reservation and the general manager was not apologetic
We ended up spending loads of money in the bar waiting for an hour for the table we had originally reserved
The food was pretty good (although there are three tasting menus with no explanation of what is on the menus or the difference in any of the menus) and the room we finally got was very cool but our experience was ruined because we received no apology or compensation for their mistake
It is about time that we have a Japanese restaurant with amazing food that doesn't break the bank
Space is grand and beautiful
Open kitchen is very cool
This is absolutely my favorite restaurant now! Very attentive service
Next time, I will try the private tatami rooms
Their cocktails are great also
Women's uniforms were a bit tacky and unflattering but the men looked cute w/ their cool head bands
Good people watching space as well
They were good w/ honoring the reservation and didnt' seem to overbook considering it is new
As a local to this Japanese Brasserie I could not wait to finally get in there after months of construction
It was more then I expected and I couldn't be happier to have En as my new neighbor
The authentic Japanese food was outstanding
Staff were sweethearts and the place was gorgeous
The prices were moderate to high but worth it
I will be coming back!
The Scene The glow from the restaurant's wood-burning oven carries a warm welcome to the unpretentious neighborhood crowd
The narrow front room lined with wooden tables opens into an indoor/outdoor back dining room, overlooking potted herbs that top the pies
Unfortunately, the uninformed service doesn't honor the carefully selected ingredients (organic flour, artisanal cheese and local produce)
The Food Though pizza reigns supreme, the starter of clams baked in a tangy broth of capers, lemon, garlic and herbs is a lovely diversion
Generous toppings grace the more than 20 pies, organized by first, second and third generation
Even on the classic, normally spare, margherita, the rich mozzarella nearly overpowers the sweet tomato sauce; yet the richness is addicting
The thin crust, charred black around the edges, adds a smokey dimension, which pulls together the oddball Salsiccia Di Agnello, with lamb sausage, two cheeses and pistachios
Save room for the light tiramisu
I think locals rate this place so high
After the review I treked into Brooklyn
First off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine, even with no idea how to use them
Anyway, this is the last time I cross the williamsburg
thank goodness people are recognizing this place
i started going here when they first opened
delicious pizza, great price, and they delivery, what more could you want?
We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday, and I was thoroughly impressed with the food
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave
THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden
I will definetly be going back
if you like em thin and fancy, you'll like fornino
my personal favorite is the spinach but i've liked almost everything i've tried
the tiramisu is pretty good too
A lovely restaurant with delicious food and good service
You would never think you were on Bedford Ave, where every place is hyped up for no reason
A very pleasant surprise
I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away
It is simply amazing
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious
I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try
You will find yourself returning quite often
P
S
Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there
LOL
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though)
My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better
The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids
Overall I would recommend it and go back again
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
don't be fool w/this pizza spot
you can't just buy a slice because everything is freshly made to orders

The atmosphere, although lively, permitted easy conversation
Entrees (grilled sea bass and roasted rack of lamb) (Thursday's daily special) were perfectly prepared
Ravioli filled with chopped lamb, which could have been more aggressively spiced, arrived in a nice tomato reduction
Desserts, a bitter chocolate cylinder filled with chocolate mousse on an intense orange reduction, and a dish of exotically flavored ice creams, were a fine finish
I post with mixed feelings
I want this place to succeed, but not to the extent that we'll need reservations weeks in advance

I've been to Nice Matin once for dinner and once for brunch
The food is generally good but the service is revolting
At dinner, my food was great but my companions had fish that had been burned on the grill and tasted like hamburgers
They said they could not cook it another way
At brunch we had the rudest, most incompetant waiter ever
He had to ask our order twice and then they ran out of cereal!! Then he slammed the menu down in front of me and walked away
We left before we could eat anything
I went there because I saw Leeks Vinaigrette on the menu
When I am not in Paris, I dream about leeks vinaigrette
The kind you get at your favorite brasserie in Paris, like Gourmet des Ternes or Chez Lipp
Unfortunately, while the leeks at Nice Matin was delicious, it was not the big fat leeks that you get in Paris
The food was very good in general
The wine list is not great (interesting choices by the glass, Arbois (a Jura wine) and Condrieu (a Rhone white), but both of them turn out to be lackluster or worse
)
Service was great
The beer section was not bad
Definitively worth a try -- I hope the usual UWS restaurant-goers won't turn it into a mediocre restaurant as the trend has been
Look at Savann and Ouest
Had a wonderful dinner at the bar
The mussels appetizer (hot, not cold) was rich and flavorful
Duck Magret was perfect
Desserts are must haves
I stumbled in with friends while looking for a good place to eat and were pleasantly surprised
Great food, friendly service and nice general suroundings
I will come back
Can still smell the paint
food was good, service DEFINITELY needs a few weeks to iron out the kinks
Adorable place and will have outdoor seating soon
Great menu, sort of expensive for what I perceive to be a neighborhood place
The Scene Blue Ribbon addresses Brooklyn's top-notch sushi deficit with a handsomely appointed outpost that, like next door's Blue Ribbon Brooklyn, is superior to its Manhattan sibling
The tastefully understated decor is heavy on dark, solid wood and most importantly, space
Aside from the large, glowing sushi bar, the seating is all booths, and they're set well-apart, too
Service is friendly and efficient
The Food Staples are mostly well-executed, but it's the more original dishes that set this place apart, like the Dynamite, a delicious broiled sea scallop, mushroom and smelt roe appetizer presented in an open shell with a golden-brown crust
Maki rolls feature luxe confections like a juicy eel, avocado and radish roll, and the Blue Ribbon, a divine combination of lobster, shisho and black caviar
Sushi and sashimi range from good to excellent--don't miss the melting, buttery o-toro special (bluefin tuna belly) if it's available
I love blue ribbon sushi! It has great fresh fish, just as good as nobu
The service is excellent, and nice ambience also
The food is not trendy but it is the best sushi
First off, this restaurant is on par with Nobu in Tribeca
We were seated immediately on a Thursday night at around 9 PM, which is outstanding in my book
However, we all noticed that the hostess was slightly peeved at a customer for requesting a table even though he was by himself
Save yourself the attitude and sit at the sushi bar if you're solo
We got a handful of appetizers including the Salmon Tartare, the soft shell crab roll, and the octopus sashimi
All were exemplary (especially the soft shell)
The wine list is reasonably priced and well selected, make sure to treat yourself
We ordered the Blue Ribbon Special for our main entree which will serve 2-4 people and was more than enough food for all three of us
The tuna and yellowtail sashimi were bordering on euphoric, even the mackerel was better than any I had prior
There is also a cool surprise with the special which I won't give away but is unique to Blue Ribbon
This was one of the best meals I have ever had, I was scant in my description because I would hate to give it all away
Be prepared to spend a little money, but what else is worth your money? Good food should be priced at a premium and you will not be disappointed
Next time we go, we are going for the Omikase menu
and we can't wait!
Manhattan's Blue Ribbon Sushi is at the top of my sushi list for that island, and the Brooklyn branch is just as great
The sushi is simply superb - perfect fish, expert rice and fascinating unique creations
I love the small and diverse sake list
A great spot for a special dinner
If you want comparably great sushi, in a bright and crowded room, and at a considerably lower cost, walk over to Flatbush and Park Pl
and try Geido
I went here with the gf
The chicken teriyaki and sushi were both very good
Their signature dish, the Blue Ribbon roll (1/2 lobster, shiso black caviar) was disappointing
It was dry and flavorless
The wait staff was competent but not spectacular
Empty dishes were removed promptly but they forgot one of our dishes and never once came by to ask if we wanted anything else on the menu or to refill our water glasses
The dcor and ambiance was pleasing in a Soho/ Greenwich village sort of way, mostly exposed brick and polished wood
Overall, I thought this was a nice restaurant but a step or two shy of greatness
Love this place ever since we found it! Keep up the good work! Two thumbs up!
Yes, it's expensive
But worth it
I'm not a high roller by any stretch, but I never have a problem dropping the money at BRS because it's always excellent
Maybe I've just gotten lucky with seating, but I've never had more than a ten minute wait
Everything here
just wonderful
The food most of all, but the drinks, the decor, the service
everything is top-notch
Certainly not a place most of us can afford to go on a regular basis, but for me, when I have something to celebrate, this place (along with Blue Ribbon next door) is always at the top of the list
I went on a lark with a friend who had just flown into town
We sat at the bar, and we decided to tell the chef to do as he pleased
I was so surprised
Both of us I would say are sushi lovers and have had it on both coasts and abroad, and I can say I have grown up eating it
this was a special experience, and truly delicious
It was expensive mind you, but the fish was fantastic
I could go into detail but I'd rather not spoil it
I left there eager to go back
This is the best sushi/sashimi I have had in the city
I have been coming here for over a year now and all I can say is that the fish, the service and the atmosphere are excellent
If you are looking for sushi definitely come here
Save some pennies, find a date, sit at the sushi bar, have a box (or 2 or 3) of sake, pick an amount of money you want to spend on sushi and order the omakase - chef's choice
The presentation alone is worth it
Besides that, the place looks great with its dim lighting and brick and wood and the staff and chefs have been consistently friendly, welcoming and wonderful
Remember
sushi is about the fish and I have yet to find better, fresher fish than I have here

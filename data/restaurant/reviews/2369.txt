everything is excellent from the salsa to the dessert
i go there anytime i get the chance
all of the reviews about the cramped space seem to be from bar patrons and not diners
there is an upstairs that is not cramped and is decorated in a very colorful, festive (and authentic) way
I can't believe how bad the service was at this place, it was truly unbelievable
BOTH bartenders were basically ignoring my friends and I when the place was not crowded at all
I am not asking for a chatty barman just some decent service, I get much better service at Rosa Mexicano and Maya, where the Margaritas are actually FABULOUS! I am never going back and am going to tell all my friends never to go back as well
I am from Mexico and it's an embarrasment that this place claims to be an aunthentic Mexican rest
If you like strong drinks this is the place to go
The $8
50 margaritas have more than twice the alcohol of margaritas somewhere else and still tastes great
It's a very good first drink place
Can't say much about the lack of space though
It seems silly to have the $15 food minimum because everyone is crowded at the front of the restaurant and all the tables are empty
I visited Zarela's with co-workers
We wanted to sit down and enjoy some appetizers, but Zarela's wouldn't let us sit down at a table unless we ordered DINNER which had to be a minimum $15/person
This is ridiculous! What kind of place mandates to customers that they HAVE to order dinner? Why do you have appetizers if we can't order them and sit down at the same time? We ended up having to stand at the bar with appetizers all over the place and it was very inconvenient
Our bill was actually more expensive with appetizers and drinks than it would have been with just dinner
Whatever happened to relaxing with some friends?  I would never go back to this place
The margaritas were good, but the customer service was terrible
They lost 8 customers including all of their friends, just because we couldn't sit down and enjoy appetizers!
decent food and great margaritas, which give you a hangover for days
though the service was ok, our reception was very poor
the host (zarela, i assume) was rude, especially after she reminded us for the 3rd time we had to consume $15 dollars worth of food in order to get a table
eventhough the place was empty
My girlfriend and I were really disappointed with the food, price and service
There is absolutely no reason to wait on line for this dump
We felt like fools walking out because we had waited about 20 minutes to be seated
The service was slow and I got the impression that the waiters wanted us out of there as soon as possible
They are slow to serve you the food, but they are damn fast to give you the check!
Took a LONG time to get a table (at 8:30 on a Wednesday!) but the phenomenal margaritas made the time fly
The food's ok, but the surprisingly strong margaritas made it much better
Don't go if you're in a rush, and don't have more than two margaritas, but definitely check this place out some time
I came here for dinner last night with a few friends and was thoroughly disguisted with the quality of the service over there and also was not impressed with the food
This place is definitely over rated ! Not only were the waitors rude to us, but they also had the audacity to tell us that they were doing us a favor by giving us a table
I would definitely not recommend this place to anybody
This was a disaster from the moment we walked in!! We had to wait 10 minutes just to order drinks
Our waiter would disappear for long stretches of time and the table wasn't cleared after each course; we sat there staring at 1/2 empty plates
The space was EXTREMELY limited!! Conversation was out of the question, you had to scream to be heard
The food was below average, go there for drinks ONLY, definitely NOT to eat
If you want great Mexican food, great service, and a good atmosphere, GO TO MAYA
, we'll never stray again!
Closest to real Mexican of the various upscale spots now in NYC
While the menu hasn't changed much in years, there is a reason for that - the dishes are consistently good
Great queso fundido, calamari, tamales, lamb and pork dishes
The mango margaritas are ridiculous and the place is generally kid friendly (not that the two necessarily go together)
This is a great place to go on Sunday nights with a group of friends - best i've found in the city for AUTHENTIC mexican food - Margharittas are nice and strong!
Been here many times and have always had a good meal
It gets noisy and crowded downstairs so if you want a quiet meal, make sure you get a table upstairs
Quality, authentic food
Authentic mexican fare, killer margaritas, and a festive atmosphere make this a place to return to over and over
Zarela Martinez makes you feel like she is entertaining you in her own home
Chilaquiles are a must to start with
Ditto the Arroz con Crema as a side
And I have yet to find an entree I didn't like
Favorites include the duck, shrimp with chipotle, pork in banana leaf, chicken wiht habanero and fajitas
My husband and I love Zarela's and have never been disappointed! We've celebrated many wonderful events here and have brought many friends! We hope the restaurant continues to make the wonderful food it has in the past
I went to this restaraunt because the owner is from my home town of El Paso TX
I didnt get anything I expected the food was bad and she was so rude that I have never forgotten it
It is a terrible representation of Mexican cuisine and service
This place was way too crowded
Me and my friends had to yell at each other to talk
They hated me after i went here, so ill make it up by taking them to serendipity 3
I don't understand how this place was rated so high
It is a tacky restaurant, with bad food and service
How can a waiter/waitress never check back on a table and leave the table without drinks for over 10 minutes? Not to mention the food was indigestable! I will stick with the best MAYA!
My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now, and it all started with dinner at Zarela
He showed me he had good taste by bringing my here
Excellent food, wonderful service and amazing memories
Despite what others may say, this place is far superior in cuisine than Rosa
Atmosphere, I'd give to Rosa or Maya, but Mexican fare at Zarela is tops
Recently, I have been frequenting the bar scene at Zarela
After a few margaritas you'll be feeling like Yasmine Bleeth on one of her bad days
Order from the bartender who resembles a Chelsea variety of Marlon Brando
He's quite a morose character and if you're cute, he may put a little extra love into your frozen drink
For men seeking women, you may want to start here and move elsewhere
The females in attendence are a little career worn and rumpled around the edges
But after a few of Garland Brando's concoctions, these powersuited bassett hounds will look like Angela Bassett
I ate here in March and had a great time
Went shopping with a couple of friends and stopped in Lord Taylor
The salmon salad was really amazing, my friends both had chicken caesars that they liked
But the salmon was really good
The room is small, but the service was very friendly and they seemed like they actually didn't mind serving you (unlike most waiters in this city)
We literally stumbled on this place, had no idea it existed
The food was really good, the service is very nice and accomadating
This is inside Lord Taylor and I was surprised that a restaurant this good can be found in a store
They are only open for lunch but bring your appetitie
The menu is more on the dinnery side, and be prepared to relax
I recommend if not in a hurry! I highly recommend if you are in Lord Taylor or in the neighborhood and want some good food
Great food, reasonable prices, good location and great desserts!! This midtown bistro is always crowded so make sure you have reservations and time to enjoy your extended lunch! The food is quite good!
In Short "Eclectic Indian cuisine" is the tagline, and indeed, the extensive menu at Chola showcases dishes from all of India's culinary regions: dosas and idly from Madras, vindaloo from Goa, and a host of Punjabi, Bengali and other specialties
Each dish is elaborately described on the menu, making every meal an education
The large, dimly lit space is pleasant but fairly plain
The fixed-price lunch buffet offers an excellent opportunity to try a variety of dishes
I am from Bombay I know good indian food, so far I've eaten at this restaurant thrice  I must say that the service ruins the experience every time
The food is below average as other reviewers have stated, but I was being a little adventurous
Its honestly such a boring indian restaurant, when we asked our server, what was thier speciality, he claimed to have everything extraordinary
well, we ordered north south indian staple dishes
The quality of food felt like,it was mass produced commercial
there south indian is so overrated, north indian food was very oily prices were out rageous

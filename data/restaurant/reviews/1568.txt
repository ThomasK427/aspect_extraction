Anyone seeking a good meal and affordable prices, who isn't watching thier weight, should definitely come to chat 'n' chew
Chat 'n Chew has become a favorite after-work spot for me
the food is tasty, filling, and reasonably priced, and the setting is very low-key and welcoming (even when it gets crowded, which it does pretty frequently)
The mac cheese and fried chicken are both excellent, no-frills comfort food
This is such a cute little place for when you don't want to spend a lot
The mac and cheese is pretty good and i especially love their sweet potato fries!!! Mmmm
The mac cheese is wonderful! This is the cutest little spot for a quick bite of great food!
I have been here so many times
very satisfied with the food and service
The waitress was very attentive and very nice as well, the hamburger is really worthed the money you pay for
Quick service and totally american atmosphere
For sure no Euro-trash in here
Word of mouth from friends and family is what usually urges me to visit a new eatery
but why havent I heard of the Chat n Chew before??? Its one of the best places to eat in the city with a friendly atmosphere, good food, and hot waitresses :)
HUGE portions, funky atmosphere, good prices
The chicken pot pies are the size of a bakery pie - they take up the whole plate! The mac 'n cheese must be tasted to be believed
the Uncle Red's Addiction (fried chicken) is to DIE for, don't even bother looking at anything else on the menu
but make sure you come with an empty stomach, coz you're gonna need it
Having visited this Union Square Gem several times with out of town guests, everyone ALWAYS leaves satisfied! It is an experience for friends to share food and have a great time
Thanksgiving on A Roll can not be beaten! The wait staff is extraoridnary, and the food palate pleasing regardless of your choice! WOW! Is this place really in New York City?! Bravo to staff and owners! I hope to return for countless visits for fun and great food!
You can surely find much better comfort food at many places in NYC
THe food is average at best, and the three times I've been the service has been terribly poor
Try Mama's, Duke's, Pink Tea Cup, Brother Jimmy's instead
Coming from New Orleans, I was pretty amused to see our local favorites all dressed up and priced accordingly
Food not bad, but a bland shadow of the food it is immitating
I have been going to Chat n' Chew for brunch for six years now
I highly recommend Chat n' Chew for a casual brunch
They have banana pecan pancakes, an omlete with veggies and fontina cheese, a granola fruit and yogart dish which are all excellent
They usually have frittatas on their specials menus which is always good
Often times with brunch, there is a wait for a table
Two friends (Texans) and I (all cooks) went a few weeks ago and left extremely satisfied
I had read the mixed reviews here
but thought taking my Southern friends would help evaluate it properly
One ordered the Salad Special - egg salad - and a bowl of corn chowder
The other had the Turkey sandwich
I had the BLT
Plus a side of the Mac'n'Cheese to share
The Mac'n'Cheese was good, nothing amazing
It was a bit dry and bland for my taste
Same with the soup
Other than that we were all satisfied and pleased with the tasty and FILLING portions of our sandwiches and salad
The BLT had a massive dose of bacon and great bread
All were reasonably priced, and service was fine - very attentive
All in all, a great place to go for some good food at a good price, plus free soda refills!!
I went there recently with my boyfriend and not only did it take the waitress 20 minutes to acknowledge we were even there, 20 minutes to get us water and coffee and even MORE time to place our order and get food! Seriously overrated
If you want good comfort food, go to Mama's Food Shop in the east village!
Chat 'n' Chew is a comfy, friendly environment with delicious food and an ambience that makes conversation flow easier within its walls
While attending drama school nearby, my classmates and I would come down in groups of 5-10 and always enjoy our 'homemade' meals there more than any other joint in the neighbourhood
I definitely recommend it for old friends catching up over hot chocolate
Just go!
definitely one of the most disappointing dining experiences i've had in nyc
it took over half an hour for someone to take our order
and then another half hour for the food to come
the food was alright
(the mac n cheese was not all that
) our waitress was not at all attentive
we saw another waitress spill hot coffee on another diner's foot
and they serve fresh orange juice that is actually frozen/then thawed
the waitress gave some guy this huge long explanation
i was so disappointed w/ this place
it looked sooooo cute too! try coffee shop around the corner for good food and service
I had a pleasant time with three friends at this place but it's more on our conversation rather than the food
The Food Gods must have zapped bad Karma on me that night for the pork chops were super dry and bland tasting with the sauce
Even the ultimate comfort dessert for me, Apple Pie A La Mode was disappointing
The pie was not warm and more like a limp cardboard with a dollop of semi-melted vanilla ice cream
It's an okay place to hang and chill but don't expect much to chew on anything
The macaroni and cheese was, indeed, very tasty, but everything else was not good
The dishes weren't clean and the restrooms were marginal
Food was bland and greasy
The only good part was we met 2 cast members from MTV's The Real World eating one table away
Not a great dining experience
consistent food yes
staff, nice enough
Although, the t-shirt uniform, in the laissez-faire hands of the staff, gives an almost Hooters vibe to the place
I find it's become the default setting on my comfort food dial
If you're traveling, and not already in the neighborhood, go to Cowgirl Hall of Fame instead
This is one of my favorite places to eat when I have fried food cravings
The Mac Cheese is great as well as the fried chicken and bbq'ed sweet potatoes
It's cozy, no complaints about the service, and there's a good variety of food
GREAT MAC AND CHEESE HAVE IT WITH A BLACK CHERRY SODA
FUN FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE
i just went here last night for the first time in years, and i thought it was great
i had the amazing blt and sweet potato fries were divine (and a huge portion big enough for 3!)
i previously stayed away because i think the prices are steep for home-style fare, but it sure was good
The place was cute enough and we were really excited to go and try the food but we waited about 45 min
for our food to come
The restaurant was empty so we decided to ask the waiter if our food was coming soon and we were greeted with a very rude attitude and were told that I sure it is cooking, you can wait
We decided to leave and try another place because we were starving as we started to leave we were cursed at by the waiter! The attitude and treatment was so bad surely the food must be spectacular and in high demand for people to tolerate this kind of treatment in NY from a simple diner but we certainly will never go back
I really liked chat 'n' chew
The food was really good
You have to try the thanksgiving on roll
It was yummy
the atomosphere is very casual and fun
I would definitely go back
The atmosphere was very comfortable, seated right away and the service was great
The menu has the most original names, and the food was sooo tasty!! You have to order the sweet potatoe french fries! For my friend's birthday, the waitress discreetly brought over some dessert with a candle
Definitely that place to unwind!
A reliable place to get the best mac n' cheese in the neighborhood
It's a good deal and the servers also serve some attitude (some find it charming and witty, others not so much)
It's cramped and loud, but it's a good standby

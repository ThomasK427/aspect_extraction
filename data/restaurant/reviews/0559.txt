The dishes are beatifully prepared, delicious, and unique as well
The lobster bisque was perfect
Service was beyond expectation
We probably had 6 people waiting on the two of us, with a seperate person refilling water, bringing out more bread, replacing silverware, and few more making sure we were satisfied
After we had placed our order, they also took the effort to come back, and confirm that we are allowed to eat pork (which we weren't), because it was incorporated in the seafood dish my gf ordered but not stated on the menu
That's when you know a restaurant really aims to please
Dinner for two, no wine, prix fix (+ lobster bisque) came to about $250 with tip
wonderful dining experience
as good as the food was, the service was even better, as good as any restaurant in new york
delightful bouche amuses included a tuna/tomato tartare
the dayboat halibut with sliced hearts of palm w/ a truffle sauce was wonderful
the rack of lamb cooked to perfection
one of our guests has dietary restrictions and they were more than happy to please
souffles were creamy and delicious
only complaint was the $12 per bottle for water
please!!
Perfection in every sense of the word, from the wait staff and our server and the sommelier, to the impeccable squab/foie gras crousillant and banana walnut souffle, it's simply a meal made in heaven
Memorable food with the most professional yet friendly staff, what better way to splurg! There wasn't even a single wrinkle from folding on the perfectly taut Frette table cloths! Go before they jack up the prices, because they will
Certainly, this is on a par with the most impressive modern French cooking you're going to find anywhere
All the critics have praised the rabbit terrine with hyssop, and I agree: it is a stunning dish
It is enormously classy (as is the impeccable service)
But don't let that suggest that it is lacking in power - tasting great is not incompatible with subtlety
This restaurant is destined to be a real ornament on the New York dining scene
Located in the new Ritz Carlton Central Park, this restaurant is probably the new big hit in town,The Chef from Jean Georges, and the amazing front of the house staff ex pros from the Bernardin will make this place the new hot spot,
The Scene The room glows a flattering amber; wood banquettes, softened by a scattering of cushy, embroidered pillows, run the length of the room
The space is sultry without being overtly romantic, due in part to edgy touches like art deco-style steel fans and an incredibly long wrought-iron mirror
The neighborhood's mixed populace is represented nightly--you'll see heels, denim and a fair share of tattoos
The Food Starters are quite good, including tender short ribs, wrapped around stalks of lemongrass; aromatic five-spice quail; and spring rolls, brought to the table with lettuce and mint leaf wrappers
Soups, perhaps the benchmark of Vietnamese cooking, are excellent, especially the crab and shrimp soup with noodles
Entrees continue the hot streak: Whether it's the fish of the day, the iron-pot chicken or the excellent filet mignon, it's difficult to go wrong
Interesting desserts feature unusual ingredients, such as black sesame and pandan
You better off go to Queens and eat at the take-out joint in Queens where Michael Huynh stole all his recipes from when he is not too busy kissing up the James Beards Foundation
wednesday night , august 2nd
i work in to bao quarter to 8 , there were two tables @ the restaurant , no one at the bar
i like to seat at the bar
for 15 mn , she did not look at me
she was putting bottle in the refrigerator
And there were another waitress next to her
when i ask if there were someone working , she ask me to wait
i have been waiting for 15 mn ( no food menu , no cocktail menu , no one even say hi to me )
i own a restaurant but , i will not have that girl work for me
second time at bao but will never go back
when i'm spending my money , i deserve some respect and good hospitality at least
thanks to the bartender
I had dinner at Bao 111 last evening
I had not been in almost a year, and did not know quite what to expect
While it is true that my past dining experiences at Bao 111 had always been favorable, sometimes a restaurant starts to believe its' own hype and goes downhill
However, that was not the case at Bao 111
The food was delicious! The spare ribs are to die for, and the sea bass was perfect
The surroundings make for a funky, intimate, sexy evening
We (2 couples) tried almost all of the appetizers on the menu and I found the appetizers amazing! I didnt have very high expectations before to Bao as I thought it was another trendy fusion places in the LES
However, the restaurant kept the Vietnamese flavors true but enhanced the presentation and cooking styles
Some items that stood out were grilled short rib, which was really really tender with a nice lemongrass flavor, the calamari stuffed with prawn had a good texture and the frog leg, which was very crispy
However, I found the main to be too American
But maybe thats because we ordered the mignonette, duck breast and steak and not the traditional style mains
The fish our friend ordered had a beautiful presentation
The meat was filleted and the bone was served standing up and curved around the fish
I also love the sake selections
Went in December '05 on a date
Pros: Food was undoubtedly excellent - all of it - 2 cocktails, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 1 desert
Service was quick and pleasant
Cons: Price far too expensive for the cuisine and location - bill came to $110
Decor is plain and unimaginative
Ambience nothing special and a bit crammed
Overall: Recommend trying Bao 111 at least once, because the food is quite tasty
However, we are unlikely to schlep over there again
At this price-point, there are MANY other excellent dining options in locations that are MUCH easier to reach
The schlep to Avenue C and 7th isn't worth the effort
we went on a sunday night and it wasn't crowded
the staff seated us quickly and we had a model/waiter who was attentive for a while but then seemed to lose interest
the food was delicious
for appetizers we had the quail and octopus salad, both of which were fresh and tasty; we liked the rice powder garnish with octopus
for mains we had the shrimp curry and fish curry, both of which were rich and flavorful, with subtle deep textures
highly recommended
we also enjoyed two bottles of sake which added $50 to our tab--and if not for that the bill would have been more of a bargain
while a lot of diners ding this place for lousy service we recommend going on an off-peak night and enyoying the food, which is really worth it
We had dinner on a Thursday night and it was packed
The food was excellent
The bathroom was a bit small, and the space in between tables was pretty minimal
But the presentation of the food was very nice and the food itself was splendid
The crowd was well dressed and the servers were good lookers, too
Nice lighting in the restaurant to set the mood
Desserts were very good, too
Went last weekend - food was awful, with the exception of the fake short ribs
Had quite possibly the two worst waiters of all time
I asked each of them at least three times for a dish they they forgot - took about an hour to receive it
They acted as if it were my fault that they forgot to put in the order
I will absolutely never go back here
Note to chef: who wants to eat a goat cheesecake?? GROSS
enjoyed a friend's birthday with 12 people at bao 111
the service was excellent and very attentive
had booked a table early in the week and were told that the prix fixe was a must for a large group, which was emailed within a day of making the reservation
we were not disappointed and had a leisurely meal with appealing and tasty dishes coming out throughout the evening
paired with a great riesling from a fair wine list we had an outstanding experience
I just went here for the first time and I loved it
I went with 6 people and we had table in back that is semi private and close to kitchen
The cocktails were great! Saketinis yummy and they have Tiger Beer
The tuna spring roll, fish curry, filet, snapper - all had great flavor and were great to share
The desserts fabulous! We had chocolate cake, yuca cake and the coconut custard in chocolate soup
Chocolate cake was the best, but all delicious

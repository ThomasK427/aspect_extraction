Shocking that sides of vegies are $6
that is what I would expect to pay in a more upscale restaurant
The service is spotty, sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there
Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food
We tried to get a table at the horrific Extra Virgin just one block away, but after waiting more than 70 minutes, we bailed and popped into Mary's at 11:00 p
m
on a Saturday
The staff was happy to seat and serve us, the food was delicious, and we were never rushed even though we were the last table in the restaurant before closing
So glad our experience at Extra Virgin was so negative, because Mary's was a hit
I was a little leary about Mary's at first - it's small, crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but I'm glad I finally tried it
To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready
Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly
The waitstaff were attentive, polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters
And the food was fantastic
From the entrees to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple
I would definitely recommend Mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts
The food is good, I can't lie
But the staff was so horrible to us
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order
This place is pricey, and yes, the food is worth it; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price
Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!
We went on a Saturday night at 7 expecting to wait
We were told an hour wait which we thought was fine
We weren't seated until 8:45
We were pressured to order immediately and as fast as we ordered our appetizers they were delivered
They were supposed to be whole belly clams- but they were so deep fried that if there was a belly in there we couldnt find it
Meals were skate, lobster pot pie, sea bass and one other that escapes my mind
The skate was average
Lobster pot pie a complete rip off and sea bass adequate
We had the hot fudge sundae for desert which was cold clotted fudge that was worse than Friendly's
After waiting 1 and 3/4 hours for this experience it ended in a mere hour
They were removing plates from our table while we were still chewing
We went here for the first time knowing we'd be in for a long wait
Arriving at 6:45 on a Wednesday, we left our name and cell # and were told it would be an hour wait
We went to a nearby bar, had drinks, headed back around 7:45 and were seated in 5 minutes
We shared oysters for an appetizer, they were tasty but on the small side
We both had the lobster roll, which comes with fries
It was delicious! I am not a big fan of mayonaisse, I asked if they made the lobster roll with just butter- no they don't
But the sauce wasn't overwhelming and had a wonderful lemony taste
The roll looks small, but it is actually alot of lobster
Excellent! We left at 9- heard the waitresses telling diners they'd run out of lobster roll at that time - so beware of shortages
Great fresh seafood, but
jeez, this place is tiny
Fine to go on the occasional slow night, but its so cramped and crowded on the average night that its hard to have a pleasant meal
which is too bad because the food is soooo good
I went there recently on a Friday night
I had to wait 45 minutes, but that is to be expected in a small, good restaurant
My friend and I sat at the bar, and the service was friendly and attentive
The lobster roll and steamers were excellent
The wine list was decent and affordable
Sitting at the bar, it was fun to watch couples on dates
The place is romantic in a relaxed way
I would definitely go again
This place is incredibly tiny
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends
The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive
The food was bland oily
I just don't understand all the hype
Pearl probably has the better reputation when it comes to the lobster roll, but I think Mary's version is a notch above
The lobster is cooked to perfection and served in large chunks with Mary's relish on a home made hot dog styled bun
Whole cooked fresh fishes of the day are a great option, either fried or steamed
Other standouts include celery root cole slaw, onion rings and Mary's fettucine cut fries
Mary's is small so a good idea would be to visit during off hours, otherwise a rather long wait will be inevitable
And don't forget the blackberry shortcake for dessert
I tried to go recently with three other people and, since I know it's a popular spot, called ahead to make sure we could get a table
When we got there, they refused to seat us because our 4th wasn't there yet-even thought there were only two other people there and we assured them we would order some starters and drinks
In the 5 mins it took for our 4th to arrive, the place filled with a party of 8 and we were out of luck
Then the snotty bartender told us were being silly to go elsewhere and simply dropped our change on the bar without so much as a thank-you
Had dinner here on Saturday
1 1/2 hour wait was okay since we left our cell number and went to a bar around the block
Once seated, the service was friendly and completely on the ball
We had tix for a concert and the staff got our food out really quickly
The great: the oysters, the whole lobster, the scallops
The good: lobster roll, lobster pot pie
The salt-crusted shrimp were mediocre
just fried and they leave the tail on
Overall, a really nice place for yr seafood fix
Great west village location, good service and juicy lobster
Not the best restaurant for seafood but does the job
we had a little bit of a wait, not too bad, and the appetizers and beer were good
the scallops risotto is the way to go here
little atmosphere, steep prices
Mary's has delicious seafood - fresh fish, steamers, oysters and hands down the best lobster roll in town
It's comfortable and casual, and a terrific place if you're craving that New England shore food
lobster roll was delicious
lots of lobsters
sauce was great
steamed big clams were soooooooo good
the place is small but the food is worth it
we had to wait for 45min, but it was worth it
we sat at the counter, with a great view of the kitchen
staff was helpful
the whole fried tilapia was delicious! decor could use some upgrading, though
Good food good vibe
Staff was friendly, entrees are simple seafood dishes nothing too creative good way to get your fish fix
Recommend getting a few apetizers instead of the entree
Good lobster/oysters/veggies
Skip this expensive, overhyped hole-in-the-wall
After waiting an hour, we were seated only at the counter

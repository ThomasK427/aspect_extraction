Well, i was positively surprised, it's such a good looking place and the people were friendly with no attitude at all
We had couple of bottles of wine to complement a fantastic meal
Even my wife who is SO picky enjoyed herself
We'll definitely go back
Viva Brooklyn!
A great place to take your favorite friends out for a great home style Sicilian meal before or after a show at Brooklyn's BAM , owner has a welcome atmosphere as well as a exquisite  taste in wine
Scopello makes you part of the family as soon as you walk in the door
Don't miss the herring salad!
We, the people of Brooklyn' Fort Greene, welcome with joy and appetite this very new restaurant
It is beatifull, very sexy and the food is sublime
The owner is very funny and crazy
My favorite: Appertizer: Crocchetes, Salad: Vucciria with smoked herring and bloody oranges, Pasta : All GOOD, meat and fish : seared tuna or sarde beccafico, delish
oh! I forget not pricey
enjoy
This tiny place is a real NY find
The food is out of this world, the service is friendly, and the sangria is the best I've EVER had - and I've sampled quite a few
We were a party of 3, and we walked in and the hostess tried to seat us in a table that was for 2 people
We asked if we could sit at another table which was 2 small tables with 3 seats, and she said I told you to sit over there
After enountering that attitude, and the overwhelming heat in the place, we walked out
We walked by 3 times and missed it - this place is miniscule but awesome
Seats about 20 people but provides a cozy atmosphere
Started with a pitcher of sangria - potent
Moved on to the chips and guac and jalapeno and goat cheese ravioli for an appetizer (both excellent)
For entrees we had the special, a filet with chorizo and peppercorns - cooked to perfection and was melt in your mouth good for only $20
Also had the shrimp entree which had about 12 shrimp on there which was asbsurd for $14
We were stuffed but managed to shove the chocolate torte drenched in hazelnut down our faces for dessert
Small portion on that, but it hit the spot
We were an hour early for our reservation and they went out of their way to seat us early which was unexpected given the fact that the place is tiny
This is perhaps the best bang for your buck in all of NYC!! Creative food, warm lovely service the lowest prices in Manhattan--4 star dining @ fast foos prices! It's tiny with only about tables but well worth the wait
Try their goat cheese souffle appetizer be spellbound
Try the seafood soup (6 muscles, 4 shrimp a huge salmon fillet) be taken away
the $22 bottle of Argentinian Cabernet was excellent! Jeez there just isn't anything that this place does wrong!
I have no idea how they even fit a kitchen in this place
old place with all wood walls and tables
about 6 tables
They do have sangria at this place
Menu is a little small and it's south american food with unique dishes
Flavor was good in the guacamoleeeeeee and the chicken stuff with goat cheese
Cash rules everything around me and this place is only cash
so break out those dollar bills
aka your paycheck
Food was delicious
It was very different than what you would get at any restaurant
YOu must be a bit of an adventourus eater, because the combinations on the menu often taste better than they sound of look
Try the blue corn crepe dessert
You won't be dissapointed
went there last night with my coworker
it's such a tiny place
not for a group dinner
we heard this place used to be BYOB, but they do offer alcohol now
but you can still bring your own bottle if you would like
corkage will be $7 per bottle
whatever you order, it will be all bit spicy
all the appertizers are under $10 and entrees are all about $15
and the portion was big
will go there again!
often during busy times you'll have to wait outside to get into this tiny restaurant - but it's worth it
the flavours you will experience seem to melt on your tongue leaving you fully satisfied if not completely stuffed from wanting to savour them all! most memorable dessert - pumpkin creme brulee
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!
Unbelievable food! The Huitlacoche w/truffle oil souffle was out of this world
Very unique
Also I have to mention the stuffed chicken breast w/goat cheese and red mole was a surprising delight
Completely enjoyable plus dinner for 2 having 3 courses w/sangria totaled $60
This place is fabulous
It's small, unpretentious, laid back but attentive to detail
Meals have been constantly pleasant, mixing traditional flavors with french flair
And for the price (most entrees are under $10), how can you complain!? I like the fact that it's BYOB
Small, but not loud, and a bit off the beaten track
Couldn't be more enjoyable
I went there the other night and food was exceptional
Place is small
I hope these guys are here to stay
Very friendly
You can bring your own beer and the owner/chef comes out and drinks with you near closing
Best of luck guys
Owned and run by two brothers from Itzocan, Mexico, this restaurant makes a refreshing change from the standard Mexican fare
French/Mexican fusion best describes the food which is to die for! The atmosphere is warm and cozy (only 6 tables) the service is great (all the staff is friendly and welcoming)
I highly reccommend this hidden East Village gem!
The Scene The clean, curvaceous pop design distinguishes this narrow, brightly lit pizza joint
The room is dominated by a counter showcasing the day's fresh pizzas, which a bevy of young servers cut to order with scissors and sell by the pound
The restaurant's dearth of tables makes delivery an appealing option
The Food Pie takes a liberal approach to pizza, concocting a vast assortment of pies with toppings ranging from traditional to interesting--prosciutto and ricotta--to downright strange: potato chips and walnuts, or whole eggs
Experimentation is a good thing, but the classic Neopolitan offerings tend to be the tastiest
Crusts are thin and crisp, but a bit dry, which makes the sauceless pizzas less satisfying
Dessert pizzas, such as mascarpone and Nutella, and gelato and caramel, are surprisingly good
Love this place
There is a great selection and I think it is more affordable than pizzerias who charge by the slice
The retro/funky design is cool
We always stop by when we are in the neighborhood
This place has a somewhat fun vibe to it, compared with many other places that serve pizza
Also, they serve up a great variety of combinations that one might not normally see, and the pizza is pretty good too; however, the fact that they put your slice of pizza on a scale to determine its weight goes a bit too far, and also results in paying a bit of a premium for a slice of pizza which, while good, does not merit paying more than one would pay at most places
Give it a try if you're up for a change of pace, but overall, there are better deals
What great pizza! Very veg cool space too
Loved the dessert pizza
Cute staff, lots of fun
The pizza and the people remind me of the old school pizzerias in Rome
This is the way pizza was meant to taste like, not loaded with a ton of cheese and marinara
Neopolitan is the best
The restaurant itself is kind of a hole and very stuffy, but the pizza makes up for it
Yeah, the thin crust pizza is very tasty, but the whole snip and weigh thing is a bit too precious

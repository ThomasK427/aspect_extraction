This place is delightful!! Instead of sleek dark modern minimalism, it has the feel of Provence
The food is fabulous and varied-- from Goat to Turbot to Lamb to Lemongrass Infused Noodle Soups-- whether you are a foodie or not
I do wish the red wine glasses were a bit more bulbous and the waitstaff a bit more
je ne sais quoi (gracious)?   Delightful
Just beware the cobble stones if you wear heels
You have to be a foodie to love this place and we did
It was so delicious and the wine list was great
we couldn't make up our minds as to which one to get
Service was friendly bu t slow
the space is sexy and romantic and they played good music
Later we went up to the third floor lounge
It was playing up beat jazz and french
We ordered a bottle of champagne and they let you smoke
Oh and they have a garden but we didn't get to sit there it was booked up so we will request one next time
The staff is horribly rude
The waiter spilled our bottle of wine on us and the table and they never offered an I am sorry or anything
wine was still on the bill even after all of this and most of the wine lost to the floor and table
The service is also slow and the food was EXTREEMLY salty
The experence was 100% negative for all of us
Came in on a Tuesday night and the place was very busy
We were seated within 15 minutes
the maitre'd was very nice
in the garden which is absolutely gorgeous
the food was delicious
me and boyfriend shared the cote de boeuf which was mouth watering, the desserts were heavenly
Really loved this place!
Horribly mean
Odd menu
Miserable waiter
This place thinks they are something, when in fact, they are going to be closed in 8 mos
The scene was no existant
The crowd of unattractive wanna-bes wore shirts too tight for their flabby bodies
Much better places in the meat packing area
AVOID this one!
I loved this place! It is so beautiful and different then alot of places around the area
Really classy cool crowd
Had a really good dinner
their cocktails are very strong
be careful
Tried to make a reservation to come back but there was a two week wait which was frustrating
But anyway, will still go back
Oh and they have a nice rustic garden
a photographers dream!
thanks for bringing this new spot in the neighbourhood, it's exclusive and calm but yet in the very buzzling part of the city
love the garden and the upper floor, both are different of ambiance yet it feels very united
the food is amazing, the deserts are very refreshing and tempting
trully a great addition to new york
love it
Food was just like any other 'new american' but was tasty enough
Service was attentive although the tables in the dinning room upstairs were simply too packed for comfort
The backyard is gorgeous and is heaven if you're a smoker
I'd go back
My first and last visit to 5 Ninth was very disappointing
The most disappointing aspect of this experience was the treatment by the staff and owner
Hostile is the word that comes to mind
It came as quite a shock, to say the least
Would not recommend this establishment
The space is great as well as the food
and the staff was all very friendly
however, this is my neighborhood and i have NEVER seen a more arrogant and offensive restraunteur
and as usually the fish stinks from the head down
hopefully his staff won't be too effected
good luck
anyway
nice job renovating the space for the next owner
tude like this will have you wondering what happened in a real short time! :)
In Short This aptly named coffee shop features big wraparound windows offering a view of the bustling corner's retail activity
Inside, wireless access and a magazine rack entice casual customers to linger, and a lunch and dinner menu completes the picture
On offer: salads with shrimp or portobello mushrooms, grilled meat or vegetable skewers, sandwiches, and entrees including pastas, grilled chicken and rib eye steak
While some of Corner Shop's entrees may appeal as mouth-watering sensations, be warned, this NoHo venue (and the size of its servings) seem to cater to the model community more so than a hungry man
The $15-dollar main dish of Ravioli Tartufo (with marinated shitake mushrooms, asparagus and cheese) leaves one licking their lips; And leaves an empty stomach to boot
Window lined walls and a handsome and attentive staff can only add so much to one's overall experience, because in the end it's the food that matters most; And here, Corner Shop dissapoints with robbed, overpriced servings
I sometimes work nearby to this place, so recently I went in on my 30 minute lunch break
It was CROWDED
I sat at the bar and the whole ordering/receiving/payment process took forever, but my Vegetable Plate was DELICIOUS and the servers were nice and obviously working really, really hard, so I'm going to make it a point to come back
There are several vegetarian options, and I heard from someone they do great cocktails too
I'd like to go back later at night some time to get a drink
The Scene This dark brick-lined room, decorated with smoked mirrors, throbs to a dancey beat
The dining room, at full capacity, is more cramped than cozy: Tables are quite close together, causing diners to adjust tables to let other diners sit or stand
In season, outdoor seating permits a bit more elbow room
Servers are charismatic and charming, but can be error-prone
The Food The Mediterranean menu offers robust flavor
Seafood is a specialty: A winey scallop saltimbocca starter with veal sauce is quite good, as are curried mussels with tomato
A poached egg topper complements roasted tender artichoke handsomely, while roasted garlic perks up a sauteed spinach side
Mild-fleshed branzino, cooked whole, benefits from a tart romesco sauce; rosemary-crusted chicken is another hit
But a Gorgonzola fondue served with fries is overwhelmingly strong, and lemon-crusted cod fillet served with brandade is dry
Desserts are tasty, but not essential
I took my mom here on Saturday night before the dinner rush
It was a very cute and cozy place
I opted for the halibut - apparently one of the only permanent items, and the most popular, on the menu
It was phenomenal! My mom opted for the black bass and it was excellent too
This place was a great find and I'll definitely be going back for more
I agree, though, the waitresses outfits were atrocious (but who cares), and the music was a tad loud (my mom wasn't too thrilled when Prodigy came on), but the food made up for it!
Food Fashion have never been paired together in such a horrifying way
I've been a loyal customer to Extra Virgin since the very beginning and season after season these waitresses are tormented by management to wear these pieces of FABRIC called uniforms
I never thought I would write a comment on one of these websites, but I found myself feeling so bad for these girls I had to write something
Besides the uniforms the food and service at Extra Virgin is Great
But I guess you'll all have to see for yourself
PLEASE STOP WITH THE BAD FASHION AND JUST WEAR BLACK! - Your simpathetic customer
This is one of my favourite restaurants in the Village

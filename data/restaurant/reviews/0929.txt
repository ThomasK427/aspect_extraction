Our Asian waitress knew the menu like the back of her hand (described every sake and app in detail) and had a super friendly whatever you need vibe
At one point I was just looking around the room and the mgr came by and asked if were ok
Very attentive!! (Trust me, I looked for anything wrong as I take CitySearch reviews seriously know the biz)
The food was very inventive and not expensive for a shwanky place
The great sakes can get run up the bill fast though
(We tried almost all of them) Be sure to try the Cod
Amazing
This is a great date place
The room is beautiful and the staff really does everything to please
When I walked into Matsuri, I liked the ambiance
Being able to sit on the balcony to people watch was a definite plus
However, after this initial positive impression everything went downhill
The service was shoddy at best
The waitress was not very responsive to requests and was slow to return with drinks
Both mine and my date's meals were screwed up in some way
The meal itself was not particularly tasty--for example the kobe beef was bland
And, to round the evening out, there were several mistakes in the check
I might try this place again just to see if my first visit was a series of flukes
The ambiance is great here
Cavernous, dimly lit, with dark wood and high ceilings
This place is a slightly modern twist on traditional Japanese architecture
The food is great
However, I must mention that you have to be a true sushi/sashimi lover to enjoy the meal
The menu is based primarily on sushi and sashimi offerings
All of it tastes great but, if you're looking entrees such as chicken teriyaki this is not the place for you
The kobe beef is excellent, prepared perfectly with a delicate drop of wasabi/mustard sauce to finish the flavor
Though hiphop or pop music they were playing was hard to understand, Decor and atomosphere are really great, it is worth going
I think this place is too expensive for that level of quality and creativity
I ordered Matsuri original sushi set for $20
I received only 6 pieces of small sushi
Cocktail I ordered (something with Shiso) was waterly, I returned it
Our waiter was cute but her service was not good at all
She forgot two of our orders and there were 3 mistakes in my check
This restaurant is worth only one time
good for tourists
(Actually there were many tasteless looking tourists there, someof them looked like just came from sprots gym, which disappointed me as well) I would go KAI or Jewel Bako for better food and service with same amount of money
Beautiful interior, great location
We hung out in the Bar, it was comfortable
Ordered a beer from the bartender, she opened it and the told me that she didn't know the price !! I asked her to find it out and then she came back and threw a slip of paper at me
Apart from service like this, I would recommend here (for it's look) but take a deep breath when dealing with the below par staff
Not the place to sate oneself
the much touted kobe beef was tasty but a bit drowned in marinade
whereas the dinner portion of Matsuri Sushi Assortment was five (5) of the smallest pieces I've ever had sitting on even smaller balls of rice
In terms of flavor and freshness the sushi was good
Service is very pushy--do not try to converse or follow a train of thought--wait staff is attentive to a negative extreme--they will easily push you out in under 30 minutes if you let them
Fun for drinks before or after dinner--try La Bottega upstairs for a much more pleasant experience
Having tried this Matsuri recently, I can honestly say that it has potential
I started off with the Kobe appitizer, which was mediocre in every way but price
Moving on to the lobster sashimi - this was fair but sparse
Think in terms of the meat from a jumbo shrimp arranged on a plate with a lobster shell
In terms of service, there was consistent miscommunication between the sushi chef (jowly faced fellow at the left end of the sushi bar) and the sake sommelier
I asked for a glass and she kept trying to sell me a 750ml bottle, which in retropect would have helped to wash things down better
Try it for the scene (maybe) but not for the food
After hearing much hype about Matsuri, I finally went to check it out
I have to admit that my first impression was that it deserved the hype
The place was absolutely gorgeous! Very trendy, with a hip dining crowd
But sadly, the food fell short of expectations
Matsuri offers their own version of marinated sushi, and while good, simply cannot compare to Sushi of Gari or Sushi Seki's
The most disappointing part was when they misleadingly wrote Kobe beef on the menu, when in fact it is merely Kobe-STYLE beef
For what they were charging, they should've at least wrote it as such
The other dishes we tried were very Nobu-esque (like Matsuri's version of Nobu's signature miso cod and new style fluke sashimi)
All in all, it was a great place to people-watch, but if you are a true Japanese food connoisseur, you will find better food elsewhere
The restaurant is a scene
The food is above average to very good-the kobi beef is good, but I would not gush about it
The sushi is very good, but, again, have had better experiences at Yasuda and Nobu-some of the sushi seemed warmer than usual-but, to say the sushi was bad would be incorrect
Overall, no complaints about the food
The decor is a clash between Survivor and sushi house
Plenty of sightings of beautiful people
The hostesses have the mostest, which adds to the charm, and they seem fully familiar with designer labels
Overall, it is a fun and somewhat noisier atmosphere-it is not a quiet date place
Service can be slow-but, it is a busy place and a scene, so you got to expect this while there is still a buzz about this place
P
S
Look under the steps to find the main door
The atmosphere is great and the decor is gorgous! You step out of the cold into a warm, fun oasis! Our experience was great - the food was delicious (try the black cod!) and the sake (try wakatake) was the best I'd ever had
For appetizers, the lotus root wild mushrooms were a hit at our table
Several celeb sightings overall a good experience
We'll definitely go back again again
The music, however original, reminded me of Johnny Rocket's meets Thrift-Store 70's pop
I only liked one or two songs
Matsuri has amazing food at a terrific price
Although the Sushi menu is not as varied, as say Bond St
, the cooked food choices are a great supplement
And, that is not to say the Sushi isn't good - it is quite good
To boot, the owners did a wonderful job in creating a terrific dining atmosphere which only adds to the experience
A great place for a date or for a group dinner
The Kobe Beef was such a delight and it gets better and better until you dig in with the main course
It is about time Chelsea gets invaded by a zesty restaurant like Matsuri
The food, wine, and desserts were so divine
I can't explain the phenomenon that just had happened with me and my friends
Everything on the menu gives you a titilating feeling
forget about your diet and go all the way
For those of you guys who love to eat, this is the place to enjoy a good meal and spend three hours on chatting and people watching
Par excellence, couer de grace, magnifico
I am going to come back to this again and again
Yum Yum Delight
Appetiser we chose seared sliced Kobe Beef which was simply amazing
We also had a special seared Toro sushi which was surprisingly delicious
Entrees were very well prepared
Try the dessert sampler if you're a first timer

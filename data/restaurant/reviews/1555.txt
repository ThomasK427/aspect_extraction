Their self-serve buffet is decent, not spectacular
Best bets are mac cheese (awesome), hot choc
, choc
mouse tart w/caramel, their tiny butter cookies, and tiny chocolate cookies with sugar sprinkles
I wasn't so impressed with their large choc
chip cookies
great cookies and sweets, usually the have some good chicke dish and many vegetable dishes
the soups and mac a cheese are always good comfort food
The best hot chocolate EVER! I get mine pure - no additional fudge, no marshmallow
It's warm liquid heaven
It's a bit heavy so you might want to split one with a friend
The Indian Apple Pie is good too
I'm not too crazy about the buffet but it's so crowded that it's best skip the food and grab a cup to go
This place has a HUGE variety of breakfast breads pastries and the grill in the back is also excellent
A big open airy space, conveniently located
I'm a big fan
Fab food, great location, good-looking crowd, and plenty of space
They even like kids here -- witness the kids' corner underneath the staircase! Don't forget that they have an omelette bar in the back which is overshadowed by the sumptuous cookie-and-pastry bar up-front
We ventured out from our home to this amazing bakery, eatery, restaurant
What we were rewarded with was the excellent hot chocolate, exceleent baked goods, and amazing brunch
The view from our 2nd level balconyish seat was great for people watching and it was a blast to see the activity that buzzed below
Definitely a must go, see taste place
would highly recommend it to anyone
everything here is delicious but the chocolate chip cookies are out of this world and you can even bake them in your own oven (they come pillsbury style in the back-just don't look at the nutrition guide) great casual brunch spot, too
I don't know what the hype is about
I only tried the upstairs section, but the food was merely adequate and terribly over-priced
If this wasn't bad enough, the waitstaff thought they worked at Nobu when they should be serving McDonald's
City Bakery has the best croissant I have ever had
Everything they make is perfect
I love their variety
It's one of the few places where you can find not only sweet breakfast items but also non-sweet ones
Great for lunch too!
Nice laid back pace on Sunday
Went upstairs for table service but self-serve downstairs have a much larger variety and the sinful looking pastries
Anyway, I had avocado and smoked salmon sandwich and a side of organic mesclun salad
Excellent! The good quality bakery wheat bread was lightly toasted, and the fillings were fresh and well layered
The whole thing was nicely presented on a wooden sandwich board
The salad was one of the best I've tasted
The fresh greens were lightly coated in extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar, well seasoned and tossed
My friend's more conventional scrambled egges and roasted potatoes were also very good
Service was delightful - friendly, casually and attentive without being intrusive
It's rare to find wait staff like our wonderful waitress
Reasonable prices
I will be returning for a lot more
city bakery is delectable-just waiting on line watching the chocolate being stirred gets me excited! the hot chocolate is fabulous, baked goods are fantastic and the omelettes are delicious!! great spot for a casual brunch
In Short While many Jewish bakeries in Manhattan have, sadly, moved out to the boroughs or closed shop altogether, Moishe's -- an East Village institution -- is still going strong
There's challah, of course, and such Jewish staples as rugelach, mandelbrot, and babka
The rye bread, pumpernickel, and hard-to-find corn rye are coveted favorites
I love this place
It's ridiculously cheap and totally unpretentious
Went with my father without a reservation, and the maitre d' was very nice and sat us within 15 minutes of our arrival
Later we find out that was the owner Giovanni - we had been told that the wait would be an hour (this may be unusual)
The service was impeccable and only added to the food which was exquisite
The waiter and sommelier were very helpful and not at all snooty as some other reviewers may have indicated
The signature beef cheek ravioli is a signature dish for a reason - it was quite remarkable, and the pecorino cheese was the perfect complement
The wine list was very extensive, covering many Italian wines, and the waiter made a great suggestion for us
The desserts were good but not great; however, the espresso was unusually fine
The hype is for a reason
Do not wait to make a reservation
for small or large group
I have enjoyed lunch here on several occasions, so decided to take my husband for dinner
It was a huge disappointment
The focaccia bread was dry with a tough overcooked crust
I chose the special pasta entree of the evening - ravioli stuffed with zucchini with red pepper sauce
The ravioli filling was flavorless and the dough was extremely salty
The red pepper sauce had no taste
Fortunately, my husband just had a salad which tasted fine, although it was unremarkable
So my advice for this restaurant is be very careful what you order and expect uneven cooking
SD
Some simple logic
When a place is in high demand
guess what? You're not just going to be able to walk in there and be seated right away

The music is not elevator music, (Thank God, that's all this city needs, another blah-blah, boring restaurant)
But if you thought that the music was too loud you must live in a monastery
3
Just because you're paying good money does not mean people have to kneel at your feet
Front-of-house giovanni doesa great job
4
The food almost literally speaks for itself
I can't do it justice here
It is a pure delight
5
The service was a-m-a-z-i-n-g
We had the most patient, informed waiter I have ever come across(NIVARDO ?)
He happily answered our barrage of questions covering the entire menu
We had a great sommelier who advised us on a wonderful desert and desert wine pairing
Our reservation was at 8 oclock, we finished up at 10:10pm without rush
6
Borgo Antico has an upstairs and a downstairs
I would recommend upstairs for an 8 oclock seating, this because of the candle-light
You will begin your meal in daylight and end it in candle-light with a beautiful view of the stars above you
Truly a great experience
Pros: food, service, ambience
We were a little nervous going to Borgo Antico as we had a larger group (7 people) and that size can be very hit or miss in some union square restaurants
Borgo Antico's brunch has been recommended before, so we figured that dinner couldn't be all that bad
My family and I were pleasantly surprised by not only how delicious the meal was, but also by how friendly the service was
(reviewers were right about
) There were a few small children around and they were accommodated easily
Our group was treated as if we were the only group there (as each group was)

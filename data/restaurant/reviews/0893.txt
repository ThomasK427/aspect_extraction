They act as if we OWE them something
The outdoor cafe is better, I admit
But there are lots of rusted stains and whatnot on the chairs
Do yourself a favor
do NOT go there
And also, the prices are SO overpriced it's SO not worth it
Worst dinner I ever had - can't believe they call themselves a French restaurant
The mussels appetizer had so much sand I was spitting on it
My husband ordered the classic chicken dish Coq au vin - the dish turned out to be 3 drumsticks on top of noodles in a brown/gray gravy sauce
I ordered the seared duck breast - it was an overdone piece of duck (I asked for medium) with an over-fried hash brown that was supposed to be a potato gallete
Please save your money and go somewhere else!
I would not reccomend this restaurant to any tourists, friends or family
The service is okay
However, the food is not even close to Frech, the filet mignon is ok the best, the escargo was a very sad experience, the french onion soup was what? I don't know
I was very disapointed since I loved French cuisine and there's no good French restauant in Forest Hills
Oh well, I guess I have to go to the city for good French
For my wife's birthday we selected Rouge
It was early, so there was no one there other than the staff -- our extremely courteous waitress offered us any table we wanted
We started our evening with the 'Rouge Wine Flight' -- samples of four wines
We both selected the White, and were very pleased
My wife chose the escargot - which she felt could have been prepared better
I had the traditional French onion soup, which I devoured
My wife loved the lamb accompanied by couscous and asparagus
I thoroughly enjoyed the filet mignon (cooked rare upon our servers excellent recommendation) topped with Foie Gras (which my wife stole) and accompanied by shallot mashed potatoes and string beans
A delicious rich chocolate torte and Coconut flan in a rum sauce, along with a very flavorful coffee ended our evening
The restaurant did get crowded, but our servers attention never diminished
My bf and I went there last night for dinner; not crowded, which was nice
Bread (on the hard side) and accompanying butter and olives was served immediately
My endive salad with asparagus goat cheese was delicious; I was unimpressed by the sea scallops, but the side mashed potatoes and string beans were perfect
We had the wine sampler Flights of Wine - in red and white
The paper coaster underneath the glasses - with the names of the wines - was a nice touch
The waiter took a long time with the bill, though
The Press Box definitely a step above your average mid-town sports bar
They have great flat screen tvs always tuned to the game of the day
The food is solid, but not great
But then again what do you get at most sports bars
Service is good and the prices, especially lunch deals are very good
Clearly a self promoting ad from the business
I think there are 4
yes 4
28 inch flat screens
They are ok to watch but a little too small for blind bats like myself
The bar decor is nice and it's a good happy hour place after working with the fellow pencil necks that act busy all day but do 10 mins of work
Bar food is bar food
The fries are frozen kind and kinda tough
Although the prix fixe is a great price at $19
99, the food is lacking
My chicken cream soup was bland and the chicken was overcooked
I ordered the shrimp scampi for dinner and it was tough and did not taste anything
The veggies that came with my entree tasted as if they had gone bad
The dessert was also lacking - the apple crisp was more dry crisp with only a couple bites of apple
This is definately a place to go for drinks and then get dinner somewhere else! I have to say the seating at the bar and dining areas are very nice and the service is exceptional
the prix fixe is the best deal
nice quiet dining area in the back, busy bar area in the front - food is always fresh tasting and well prepared
not your typical pub/bar food - and my favorite place in the neighborhood
The Scene Silk shades hang from vaulted ceilings, spilling warm, flattering light over the already dashing diners
Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the bamboo-filled outdoor gardens, the restaurant's most coveted see-and-be-seen seating in warmer months
Service is swift and efficient, but has a tendency to rush through courses
The Food The menu is huge, listing traditional Japanese fare (tempura, dumplings), inventive sushi rolls and pieces, and robata (grilled meats and veggies), as well as full entrees
The best bet: Order as you go and share everything, starting with the Kobe-style beef, dramatically presented on a tabletop grill
For the carb-phobic, there's the rice-less spicy crab roll stuffed with tobiko and avocado, and robata: grilled skewers of lobster, asparagus, clams and much more
But the real draw are the nontraditional sushi pieces, like decadent foie gras with sweet-salty shiso and plum, salmon with tomato-onion marmalade and toro with jalapeno and fried garlic
Ono has a great, fun atmosphere
but most importantly all the food is amazing
If you like Japanese food, you will LOVE Ono!
I am generally not someone who writes reviews, but it would be an injustice for any future diners to waste their time and money on this OVERRATED, OVERPRICED, and POOR TASTING restaurant
the tokyo clams casino were dry and overly salty
the sashimi was no better than the packaged stuff they sell in supermarkets
the sushi rolls were nothing special, and the robato was generally bland
the kobe beef was good, but the only item that was good out of the 10 different items we ordered
the waitress never asked us how the food was or if we needed anything
she was unfriendly, curt, and unattentive
when asked for service, we'd get service with an uneager FAKE SMILE
the busboys took 20 minutes to refill our water glasses
they overcharged us with bottled water that we didn't order and did not even apologize for the mistake
all i can say is, STAY AWAY FROM ONO! trendy as it may be, there are plenty of other trendy restaurants to eat at in the meatpacking district that are well worth more for the money
Everything was very tasty
I encourage everyone to try the kobe beef appetizers
Great location and vibe
Nice drink menu
The food was very disappointing
If you are a big sushi fan, go elsewhere
The spider roll was horrible - not crunchy, below average
Sashimi was just average
Even the fried rice was overcooked and mushy
Prices were NY prices, but for $17, I expect an excellent spider roll
The Meatpacking district has many restaurants within walking distance that are so much better
I went to Ono with a group of girls and it was an amazing experience
The service was good contrary to what I have heard
The food is amazing; a tip if you do go with a group, order an array of things and share everything
The only thing I didn't like was that Ono had poor lighting
But everything else was terrific
An amazing experience
I don't think I have ever seen a maitre d' as arrogant as this guy
We were there on a date to celebrate a 30th birthday, and had requested a special table for the occasion
We waited at least 45 minutes past our reservation and were seated next to the waiter's computer station
I refused the table, as there was no way I was waiting that long just to sit there
I saw the maitre d' snicker when the hostess explained the situation, although he never once looked me in the face
We were eventually seated at an absolutely perfect window spot upstairs
and as soon as we sat down, management sent over two glasses of champagne, and I felt much better

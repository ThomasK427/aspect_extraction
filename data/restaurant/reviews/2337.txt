The drinks are killer
Could be my favorite sangria in the city
So, the next time you are at Bloomies working up an appetite, stop in
Also good for groups
It's one of my parent's favorites when they come visit when they don't want to an arm and a leg for dinner
A must try
A quality restaurent by Bloomingdale's - who would have known? Authentic and consistently good
Fairly extensive menu
Fun light atmosphere
Good date place
Would definitely recommend
Went here not expecting much
was pleasantly surprised though
Setting was pretty nice
bordering on cheesy
but it wasn't cheesy
Our waitress was really nice and attentive (refilled our water glass constantly
something that almost never happens anymore in NY restaurants)
Food is really tasty
and you get HUGE portions
I would recommend ordering an entree
and that's it
However, appetizers are good too, so order some, and just take leftovers home
Prices are EXTREMELY reasonable for the amount of food you get
A nice surprise in an area that is otherwise a dead zone for restaurants
Will be back!
Great food, service, prices
Overall a great experience
will be back again
Our friends go all the time! Price for 2 $70
2 appetizers and 1 entree was enough
I hear they are very busy at 7
But 8:30pm was a good time
I've been going to cabana for more then a year and it has allways been a great experience!! the servers and managers are so nice
this restaurants get pretty busy and we have to understand that it slows down the service a little bit in like any other restauran in new york, but I have seen this team doing their best to take care of every body equaly
yoo people! the food in this place is so good that it makes you wonder if mom is in the kitchen cooking for you!
one more thing, most of the reviews talk about the decoration, music and prices but no body talks about the people behind this, the people that works hard for you!
I'm talking about cooks, bussers, runners, servers, bartenders and managers
THANK YOU GUYS! you are doing a great job!!
the setting is festive with excellent latin music
the waiter was informative and friendly
altho they don't take reservations, we were nine people and cabana was very accomodating
the conch fritters are delicious, great paella, all of the dishes were at least good
i will go back for more!
The food is good, but the service is terrible
First, the waiter failed to bring my soup for the lunch special
Then, they did not give me my change! When I asked for it, the waiter was extremely rude
He said the thought the $8 was his tip
That's way too much tip for lousy service and a $20 lunch
The cashier was extremely uncooperative, and I never got my change
I WILL NEVER GO TO THAT RESTAURANT AGAIN
I ate at this restaurant last weekend while visiting New York
The food was excellent
The service was good too
I recommend the empanadillas- shrimp, chicken and beef! This restaurant is definitely worth trying!
GREAT FOOD!!! You will love the food at the best Nuevo Latino restaurant I have been to yet
I had the churassco which was out of this world
The pulpo salad which is marinated octopus salad was tender a tastety
My husband had the mahi mahi in saffron sauce which was really pretty and it tasted as good as it looked
Try it, you'll be thanking me at the end of the night! Best of all it wasn't hard on my wallet
Honestly, reading the negative comments posted about Nello's made my heart break
The food and atmosphere is phenomenal; this is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the city
I have been here several times and no, I am not a zillionaire - just keep in mind that if you lack a 7 figure paycheck that this is for special occasions when you really want the royal treatment
Service is excellent; food is to die for
I've rarely eaten so well this side of the pond
Lobster salad is extraordinary; pasta is perfectly done
Host and proprietor are charming and never forget a face
Summer weekenders rejoice - Nello has opened a branch in the Hamptons, as well
And as a Page 6-esque aside, I've never been here without seeing a famous face
I'll set aside snide judgment about those reviewers who surely lack the depth to appreciate a place like this (ok, just a bit of judgment
) - but in all seriousness, foodies and gourmet seekers everywhere MUST try
First off, If you are so shocked at the prices, perhaps you should leave before you order
I'm reading all these reviews and don't understand why, if these people have such a problem with paying more, they would still eat at Nellos??? Even high-priced ravoli, no matter how good, is not going to be life-changing
I'm not sure what people expect -- it's not like they conceal the prices from you or promise a serving of diamonds on the side if you stay
Personally, I've never experienced such quality service in my life and have a hard time believing that they could be so off another day
I had the dining pleasure of sitting next to a Queen
(Sorry, can't find that at Whole Foods)
I will definitely be back
Waiter pushing lobster salad as a special
Ordered
tiny heap of what looked like grass with specks of lobster(six of them)a leaf of artichoke cut up, two leaves of endive jullienned, a tenth of a tomato, cubed, three slivers of fresh basil, and some lemon juice dressing
One small bottle of Panna water
Bill: $48
I have never had such an experience
I felt completely ripped off
Even if the salad had been special--it was mediocre--nothing justifies that price
Compare: Incomparable Gotham Bar and Grill-beautifully presented, exquistily constructed salad for lunch, $15
I will spread the word far and wide that Nello's is a joke
And the joke is on an unsuspecting customer
They are laughing all the way to the bank
To quote Irving Berlin: Now, if you're blue/And you don't know where to go to/Why don't you go where fashion sits/puttin' on the Ritz
That would describe the atmosphere at this elegant (despited patched-up banquettes) neo-Italian dispenser of food and fame
The cuisine and the cellar deliver, the service is precious --whether you're famous, infamous, Ameritrash, Eurotrash or just plain ordinary-- and the tab may require a withdrawal from Ft
Knox (an appetizer of 5 well-prepared asparagus with a dollop of excellent goat cheese: $27
00)
What you pay for is an excellent chance to sit 10 feet away from European royalty, Washington movers shakers, Hollywood celebs, NY zillionaires and more face lifts than at a Blue Angels aerobatics show
So mortgage the house, wear your best casuals and check out how the other half lives as you enjoy excellent Italian fare in portions that will not expand your beltline
The decor is elegant and the food was quite good, although calling it Italian is a stretch
However, the prices are obscene
I don't care what anyone says about the value of a dollar in New York, I've lived here for years and never before have I spent $36 for 6 ravioli

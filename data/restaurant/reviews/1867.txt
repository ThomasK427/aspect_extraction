For once, the creme brulee was rustic and delicate and I've never had better
Just go, it's not a big deal but not easy to forget either
The food is just average and could use a bit more seasoning
The duck was tender but the sauce was a bit bland
The angus steak was much better and very buttery
The cod was good and the chicken was a bit dry
The salmon tartare could also use a bit more seasoning but the escargot tart was very good and garlicky
The dessert was completely disappointing
The flourless chocolate cake was barely warm and made from poor quality chocolate
The almond cake was even more disappointing
It tasted very artificial and gritty
Overall, the quality of the food was not worth the money
The service was good and unpretentious
Provence isn't the best French in Manhattan, but my date enjoyed it, so it can't be as bad as people here say! Our waiter was from Lyon and was a nice enough guy--don't get annoyed just because they're authentic French and answer the phone, bon soir
The PDAs are very annoying and the waiter's knowledge of the wine list was skimpy at best--I didn't feel very confident ordering the bottle we chose, though it ended up good
The portions are large and the dessert was excellent
Not accepting Visa/MC was annoying
Went to dinner here a few weeks back and opted for prix fixe menu
I know French food very well (am half french), but staff treat you like ignoramuses
Duck and pate was mediocre, really not up to par for prices or considering NYC restaurant standards
Service did not make you feel special, more like a cafeteria
It's mediocre at best
They need to revamp food/service/presentation or they will soon go under
Zagat and Citysercah ratings are inflated
Go elsewhere, there are plenty of choices for French food in the City
The service was friendly and attentive, the food delicious
I ordered the baby chicken and my boyfriend ordered the steak frites and we were both very happy
Larger than your typical french place in downtown manhattan but still had that cozy bistro feel
The waiter was an incarnation of a stereotypical French waiter not rude but brusque with no smile or a shadow of welcoming attitude
You had to repeat request for water several times
They use PDA to take orders
It looks awkward where they try to project an image of a tradition, including waiter speaking with French accent (in my experience most of them are not French; I am not making any assumptions here though)
Main course was late
The waiter tried his best to speed up the process by checking in confusion his gadget for where the hell are their snacks?
Pate was a little better than hardened bologna with cartilages
Foie Gras was pretty good
Bouillabaisse was a little too plain
My friend doesnt remember what he had for the main course this is how memorable the thing was
We were NOT offered desert menu
I made the mistake of making dinner reservations at this restaurant on Valentines day
Saying the wait staff here is rude is an understatement
We saw our waiter only at the time of ordering where we were greeted with arrogance and one word answers
The only attention we got was from his constant bumping into my chair as he walked by and not once did he ask how things were
Aside from the service the food here is mediocre at best
My biggest regret is having left what equated to a 10% tip for such horrendous service
Since the restaurant accepts only cash or Amex, it was easiest to leave payment on the table and cut my losses, rather than wait for change
Never again
I am 32 and have never had a worse experience at a restaurant in my life
I took my girlfriend and two other friends to dinner at Provence expecting a great meal and instead got an incredibly snide, obnoxious, insulting, waiter
I left him a $0 tip (something I had never done before in my life), complained to the maitre'd, wrote a letter to the owners the next day (it's been over a month, I still haven't heard back from them, I guess they don't care)
Maybe this restaurant isn't all that bad, I just went there once and had a miserable experience and will never, ever go back there again
I have signed up on restaurant
com for 25 off coupon
Manager was VERY RUDE and refused to accept it, saying it wasn't valid on the weekends
There were no restrictions and our bill was $100 for 2
Skip this place, there are much better restaurants in NY
We have been dining at Provence for almost 20 years
The same maitre d' is still there
Food is always lovely, nothing fancy, but always very good
Service is excellent
Pretty decor and a great neighborhood spot
Also a nice place to go with family
There is a reason it's been in the city on the same corner for so many years
It is cozy and feels like home
I am a bit surprised with the bad experience of the couple who were there for Valentine
I used to go to Provence since the beginning ( 17years), and the magic of the place is always there
Waiters are wearing a nice white shirt with a tie
and Jeans
so what ? They are elgant anyway
Professionals
food is like in South of France
And the decor is romantic and magic :)
I recommend highly this restaurant
An oasis of charm in the frenzied SoHo whirl, Provence is a great choice for a date place
The flower-festooned room is warm and romantic, the staff is oh-so-French, and the food is comforting
Nothing on the menu does cartwheels to get your attention, and you won't leave having enjoyed a transporting experience, but you WILL leave full and satisfied
Standards like country pate, escargots, roasted chicken, steak au poivre and the like are prepared with utmost competence
The crowd ranges from young Eurotrash to staid older couples, and they all seem to be having a swell time
The serivce was unrefined
No place to hang coats and the hostess couldn't have cared less
The seating was overcrowded and the servers and other patrons bumped up against my chair about 15 times
The food was mediocre at best
Dry lamb and generic appitizers
Finally, they ran out of creme brulle at 9:30 PM on Valentines Day!! For $50/per person plus wine, this was close to robbery
Overall experience was NOT GOOD
I will never return to Provence and I will never recommend this place to a friend
I recommend making a reservation for the table in the back yard
It has a little fountain in the centre, and it is very romantic
The owner is from the south of France, so the flowers, orange wine, decor and accents are genuine and evoke memories of this special area
Food is well prepared and beautifully served
The bouillabaise is as good as any, lamb is tender and well seasoned
There are specials and it's the kind of place sure to please, whether you're seated at the window near the bar or in the outdoor (covered heated when needed) garden in the rear
The place has held up and continues to deliver
Everyone we've taken there has loved it
We also had the restaurant to ourselves for a special event and were treated wonderfully
We could not have been more pleased
On Bastille Day they set up boule outdoors and it's extremely festive and fun
The Scene If ever John Waters should decide to forsake Baltimore for NYC, he'd no doubt frequently be seen at Marion's Continental
The retro-glitzy East Village mainstay is popular with cocktail-craving celebs and anyone with a taste for tradition and a craving for campy, chic fun
In keeping with the much-mythologized Marion's of yesteryear, the joint offers entertainment ranging from DJs and fashion shows to the showgirl stylings of the World Famous Pontani Sisters

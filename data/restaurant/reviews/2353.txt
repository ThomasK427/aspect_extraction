Cute little shop, much nicer than Magnolia's
It's all about the Red Velvet
Best
Red Velvet
Cupcakes
Ever
Hell would be having to choose between Magnolia Bakery and Buttercup
Let us hope we never have to make that choice
I had the pleasure of stopping by this amazing bakery
The desserts in the cases looked amazing
I had Vanilla cupcakes and also the red velvet
and i must say they were incredible
worth every penny
NOT dry or stale but fresh and creamy
Defin go there anytime your in the area
worth it 100%
I love cupcakes and these looked good but ended up being very very dry
I bought a dozen for a birthday party and was embarrassed by the quality
They tasted like they had been sitting out for days
The Customer is always wrong at Buttercup
Today, I watched as a customer was told (1) he couldn't select the time for the delivery of his gift order, (2) he couldn't order whatever he wanted, and (3) he had to ship his entire order (including items not intended for the recipient) to one address
They treat customers like kindergarten children
And why do these high-powered Wall-Street type tolerate this? Why don't these Upper East Siders take their business elsewhere?
We live in Upstate New York and go to the city often
The first place I head to is Buttercup Bake Shop for some golden cupakes with vanilla buttercream frosting
They are beyond description
I am addicted to them, especially the pink frosted ones! I also got my family hooked on these cupcakes, although they prefer other flavors
No trip to New York City would be complete without some of these cupcakes! Staff is very friendly as well
Great customer service, incredibly moist custcakes, great location are all the reasons to try Buttercup rather than Magnolia
They are everything that Magnolia is not
I was in buttercup recently and was immediately greeted by the youthful and friendly staff who were happy to fill my order rather than point me over to a table of dry cupcakes and tell me to help myself (like one place downtown)
I have been there numerous times since I have discovered it and it is just overall great
Their red velvet cupcakes are the best I've had in NYC and their banana pudding, forget about it!!! Loaded with tons of Nilla Wafers and Bananas, it is hard to stay away from
Highly recommended
Great food- But it's home to the most stupid rules ever as you can only buy 24 cupcakes a day
If you need something for a party- don't go here
I really liked the cupcakes here--moist, not too sweet and just the right size
I especially recommend the lemon cupcakes-tart and refreshing
The coconut cake is scrumptious too
I would give it a try
I was very disappointed with the much-hyped Buttercup Bake Shop
We needed a cake for a friend, so we went all out and paid the $28 for a tiny round cake
The cakes may be beautiful, but who cares if they don't taste good? The cake is dry and bland, and the icing isn't much better
I even went back once to try a different flavor overprices cupcake, but every cake tastes the same - like chewing a mouthful of tissues
The only thing worth having is the Peanut Butter Mud Bar, but even better is to avoid the place altogether
I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews here: are they perhaps talking about Magnolia Bakery instead of Buttercup? I went in on a Monday am (not during rush hour) and had a very polite girl help fill my order and make suggestions
When I mentioned I needed a birthday cake, she pointed out which cakes I can just take and go and which need to be ordered in advance
My daughter devoured the chocolate cupcake and I thought the lemon one was the best I'd EVER had: tart, creamy and not too sugary
My mouth waters just thinking about it
As good as the cupcakes are at Magnolia (and they are not half as good at Buttercup) they do not warrant the absurd attitude
Especially as the staff is, honestly, not smart enough to even know how incredibly ridiculous they sound
It does not make me want more, it just makes me want to make fun (and save the calories for Payard)
I bought a Red Velvet Cupcake and Golden Cupcake with Vanilla Icing
Both were tasty, but not so good I would switch allegiances from Magnolia to Butter Cup
My biggest issue was that the Red Velvet Cupcake's texture was kinda stale
The icing on both were good, but I prefer Magnolia's better, there's less buttercream and they are airier, almost melting in your mouth
The one plus for Butter Cup is that there actually is a distinction in flavor between the cakes and icings - something that Magnolia doesn't do
After calling and talking to rude staff at Magnolia, I called Buttercup and was assisted w/ very pleasant staff member re inquiry for last minute birthday cake for a friend who's a cake connoisseur
upon eating a slice (i'm not a cake lover at all) we both fell in love and ended up eating it for breakfast, lunch and anytime in between
Totally worth it b/c you could taste the homemade/natural ingredients (especially the butter!) also it was much more moist than it looked
i'm going to try ordering a cake to see if the moisture look and texture improve!
If the birthday girl loves chocolate, this is the perfect classic chocolate
Soft, moist, simple, and elegant
For their 8 round chocolate cake, you dont even have to place an order in advance as is the case with Magnolia Bakery
Other than the taste, this is the best quality
How many of you remember to place the order for a birthday cake 2 weeks in advance? Im always running around at the last minute
While the above-average cupcakes are in and of themselves enjoyable, the abysmal service eclipses any opportunity to enjoy the experience
Surly and sour for people who work at a bake shop, the rude and unfriendly staff have forced me to take my bonafide cupcake addiction to Hostess
My roommate got me a dozen cupcakes for my birthday, and I couldn't stop eating them until I'd had three!!! Then, I ate three more the next day
They were the best things I've ever tasted
Probably some of the best cupcakes I've tasted! In terms of their overall consistency, they taste better than the lauded cupcakes at the rival Magnolia Bakery, because ALL of their cupcakes taste delicious
And best of all, there's actually seating in the area, so if you wanted to just sample a cupcake and get a cup of coffee, you can
No attitude from their gracious staff is also refreshing
The cupcakes at Buttercup are so amazing
No office birthday is complete without them
The smooth and rich icing and the amazing texture of the cake itself will astound you
If you have a sweet tooth or not this cupcake is for you
I used to work right around the corner from Buttercup, which is extremely dangerous
The cupcakes, cakes, and other desserts are all incredible and I highly recommend them for all your celebratory needs!
The Buttercup Bakery is one of the best dessert places in the city
They have a wide variety of cakes and cupcakes, and not just the usual chocolate/vanilla/pink icky stuff that you find around the city
I tried a Lady Baltimore cupcake and a lemon cupcake, and both were amazing
My friend had a lemon meringue square as well, and that was also delicious
It's also the only place in the city I've seen to serve Hummingbird Cake, which is very rich but also very yummy
Go to this place RIGHT NOW
I mean it
Get up from the computer and go
I ordered a red velvet sheet cake for my sister's 30th birthday party and was so disappointed with it as my guests pointed out that it was very dry and hardly velvety! Maybe cupcakes are the specialty, because the red velvet cupcake I sampled was great
Please do yourself a favor and try a cupcake at this delectable bakery
I have tried every kind of cupcake they make and ABSOLUTELY EVERY ONE IS INCREDIBLE! Of course, my favorites are the standard Buttercup Golden, the BG w/chocolate frosting, and the Spice Cupcake
I have taken every out of town visitor here and am now responsible for bringing cupcakes when I go to visit them! It's worth it though! Not everyone gets to experience Buttercup on a daily basis! Magnifique!
I bought a birthday cake for a dinner party from here because I had the cupcakes once and they were wonderful
But for some reason, the cake didn't taste as great as I had remembered the cupcakes to be
The cake was a bit dry and chalky, and icing was overbearingly sweet and heavy
Someone actually thought I had made it
I was kinda embarassed when no one(including myself) finished their slice of cake
maybe it was just an off day
But I would go back for another cupcake
I bring the golden yellow cupcakes everywhere I go
It's a special treat for people, especially for those who don't come into the city often and are not aware of these sinful delicacies!!!

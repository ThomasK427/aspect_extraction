When I go for tapas, I'm expecting sazon, sabor, the whole mouth-watering experience of popping a small delicacy in your mouth
Not at La Paella
The patatas bravas were watered down, the cheese plate was plain, and the ceviche de pulpo looked like it came out of a goya can
And the sangria (or was it apple cider?) had only apples, a total lack of citrus fruits (limes, grapefruits, oranges) which are supposed to give it that tangy taste
Luckily, my dinner date compensated for the lack of sazon y sabor in the food and kept me smiling, otherwise, I would've left the restaurant pretty dissapointed
his cute little place is great for a casual date or getting together with friends
The place is full of dry roses hanging from the ceiling and Gipsy King music playing on the background
The tapas (appetizers) and sangria (a mix of wine and fruits) are really good
If you go there you must try the croquetas de hamon y queso(ham and cheese)
It melts in your mouth but you must leave room for the grill scallops
Good variety of tapas dishes
and a cozy little atmosphere as well
It gets crowded most of the time, so Xunta is around the corner!
This place is cozy, with candlelight, pretty good food, and very good sangria
I recommend the chorizo, the ceviche, and a pitcher of sangria
Some of the tapas are just ok and the paella was overcooked
Overall, a pleasant experience for a reasonable price
Dim lights, shared food, little tables, and dried roses everywhere turn this small room into a romantic gem
Get the seafood paella! They don't take reservations on weekends and the place was pleasantly full, but not overcrowded
The paella was not so great
It was on the more expensive side but the rice was very gummy
The sangria was fabulous though!!! The restaurant is small so seating was tight
One of my favorite places that's not too expensive in the city - tapas are like the Spanish equivalent of Chinese dimsum - a very social kind of food
Bring a couple of people so you can try different kinds of tapas
My favorites include the grilled squid, artichoke and chorizos, but its all good
The sauces are great for dipping bread
And the sangria is the best I've had in the city - sweet and fruity enough but not too overly strong and not fruit punch tasting
And very affordable
5 of us, 2 bottles of wine, big paella, and 8 tapas was only $150 after tax and tip
I've been to this place twice
Once with a large group and once with my girlfriend and both times the Sangria Food (esp
the tapas) were great
If you go in a large group though you may have to wait a while as we did (~30 mins)
This is not a huge place so I wouldn't recommend taking HUGE groups
When I went with my girl, the service was quick good, and we really enjoyed ourselves
Would definitely go back and highly recommend it because it doesn't kill your bank account either
Good food doesn't have to mean high price
Nice romantic spot too (in it's own way)
Great food although I'd stay away from Paellas and go for the smaller tapas which are amazing
Salmon in Asparagus and the spicy Mussels are divine
Sangria is great
The atmosphere is perfect for both a romantic date (candles, medieval Spanish atmosphere) and for groups
The basement is much more intimate than upstairs
Overall, the atmosphere and the food make it the best Tapas restaurant I know
(and yes, I know plenty)
We were a group of 20 and our experience was even better than the editor's review
Although all the tapas we ordered (squid with ink, meatballs, stuffed squash, lamb, scallops) were great, the paellas (seafood, meat) were delicious, too
The hostess was in a foul mood, weekend reservations are not accepted, and the tables/chairs are crammed downstairs, but we got there at 6:30 on a saturday night and had no problem being seated, w/most of the lower level to ourselves
Everyone was stuffed on so much food and sangria
All for only $30 a head (including the automatic 20% gratuity for large groups)
Unbeatable!
In this restaurant you are like in Spain
We went on Monday, quiet day, and was delicious to spend few hours eating amazing paella and drinking sangria
Service was very friendly
Don't miss the crema catalana the waiter recommended us for dessert
Mmm
Great atmosphere, like the decor
Nice setting
The paella is nice
Just the right flavor
Only complaint is the waiter
He comes over just once to take the order and never seen again
The bus boys on the other hand does a great job
Water is refilled without having to ask to them
Dirty plates are replaced with clean ones
Highly recommend it~!!
Food is excellent, great sangria, and although noisy, the vibe is great for either groups or couples
The dried roses on the ceiling add a nice touch
This place is popular, so expect a wait
This place has 5 different paellas to choose from - all of which look really delicious
I personally had the meat paella because I'm not a fish eater and man, it was savory! Great with groups and affordable too!
I went here for a fun dinner with friends - they do not take reservations during the week, but we were seated pretty swiftly for a Friday night, having had a delicious glass of Spanish wine at the bar
The menu has a varied list of tapas, to suit all tastes, and all our choices were a success
Their trademark paella was exceptional, we had the squid one - yummy
It all took me back to my last visit to Spain, including the great value - all in all, highly recommended
The best sangria! The sangria had just the right amount of wine and sweetness
We drank four pitchers between 6 of us
Paella was delicious and the service was terrific
We also ordered calamari, vegetable, potatoes and tons of tapas
yumm!!!Very nice staff and quite accommodating since we were 7 and only had a table for 6! I would definitely go back again
Tasty paella, tapas and sangria
Works well if you want to share plates with a friend or a group
In Short The one up the stairs and to the right, this restaurant blends in with a neighborhood of tiny Indian joints
It is distinguished by its maximalist approach to decoration, as it wages a who-can-accumulate-more-hanging-lights battle with neighbor Milon
The menu covers the expected standards: curries, kurmas, biryanis, tandooris
Specialties include lobster with spinach, spicy marinated Bombay chicken, and a chicken-liver appetizer
The prices are such that meeting the $10 minimum charge is an effort
I ALWAYS go to Panna to lift my spirits
Everytime I am down, Panna always finds a way to lift me up
Whether it's the lights, the waiters, or the food, I LOVE THIS PLACE
It is so much fun, the food is FBULOUS and did I mention cheap!
This place is so small
It's hilarious
Tables are so close that when the waiter comes by with tandoori chicken, the sizzling juices can splash on your face, body, and clothes
So, don't wear anything nice there, don't wear any giant coats either
Sometimes, the service is good, sometimes, the guys are real weirdos and try to get you out before you can finish dessert
Good prices for what they give you
Check it out, it's at least good drunk food
My friends and I have been going to Panna for years
Everything is great about the restaurant

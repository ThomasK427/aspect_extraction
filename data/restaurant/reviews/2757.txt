I think that the food is average with a poor selection of food for vegetarians
There is a great lunch discount menu that I took advantage of
The sangria was tasty and the beers were cold
Atmosphere was average for a takeout place
Overall would only suggest Elora if you had to have Mexican food but were unwilling to travel for better
I have been going here for years now
Sometimes 2 or 3 times a week
I love the strawberry marg's, the sangria is good as well
I always order the beef fajitas
enough for 2 hungry people or 3 after eating chips and guac! I love this place
not fancy I think they keep their christmas decorations up all year long, but good mexican food!!!
delicious food, great location
right by the pavillion movie theater
great date night!
This place is not fancy, but the food is fresh, delicious and well-portioned
Everything we've tried (and we go every single Friday now) has been heavenly
It's worth a trip for the shrimp chipotle enchilada alone
Try their homemade hot sauce, too
My boyfriend loves the beef soft tacos
Just don't drink their wine
Stick to beer, soft drinks or even margaritas and you'll be fine
Everything is perfect
Prompt seating, courteous service, and delicious food
The Chilliaquiles is the best
Can't find it made like this anywhere else
Simply the best around
The combo of Spanish and Mexican has a lot of competition from other excellent joints in the nabe but Elora is the queen
The Chilaquiles, Pollo Guisado, and Chili Con Carne are all unique and delicious
Everything is good
The Cubano and the chicken sandwich with guaq are also great
Even the salsa is the best around
Sit outside or in, meet the friendly waitress, and get sloshed on frosty drinks and beers
I wish I could eat there every day
Excellent pours of Czech beer on tap; friendly service, delicious red cabbage and cucumber salads
Heavy food, for sure--you will NOT leave hungry
Great for those hungover mornings when you need a decent pint and delicious, homemade food that will tide you over for the whole day
I love the pierogis! Strange, bland decor in the first room, but check out the party room in the back which comes complete with a stuffed, mounted deer's head
Sorta tacky, but the restaurant certainly has that eastern European feel to it
This place rocks
Awesome food
Best pour of Czech beer you've ever had
Go go go!!!
We went here one night because my favorite Park Slope Italian was busy as usually and we had to catch a movie
Next time
I'll wait
My friend had a pasta with 4 cheeses which stuck together like glue
My red sauce was like an HBO series - it kept repeating over and over again
Service was lack luster and even cold
The decor is old school and a throw back to the ancient red sauce joints in Little Italy
its pretty generic, with generic dishes and generic taste
Good service
The food is so-so
but if youre in the mood for comforting italian, this is a good choice in Park slope
I would rather walk down two blocks and eat at sotto voce, which has REALLY great pasta and salads
I really do enjoy this place, the staff doesn't speak much to the guests, i dont mind that! You'd think mexicans running an italian shop weren't so great, but they do it perfectly
The staff is timely and speak (whenever they do open their mouths) very friendly
Their pasta isn't spectacular nor is their marinara sauce, but their appetizers are wonderful
The fresh mozzerella is very very good
Their olive oil (for dipping purposes) has at the bottom a great mix of italian basil etc, try to get it on your bread without getting a clogged artery!!! Enjoy this place for what it is, a nice quiet place to eat with your loved ones
I have long wanted to find a tasty Italian place and we found it! On a chance on night, my fiance and I walked into HEAVEN! No matter where I go for Italian, I will always order chicken parm and fet alfredo
To me that is a staple in most places and is my make or break meal
There's is EXCELLENT! Since my first visit back in Winter 2005, we go here about once a month or so and have tried different dishes, most very good
So please stop by and try some very tasty Italian!
This is a special restaurant only for people who get it
Every restaurant in the Park Slope area is themed or garish or cheerful -- they all put on some kind of ridiculous, modern face -- or they are just sucky
Tutta Pasta is like a restaurant you would find in Houston, TX or Cleveland or Burlington -- e
g
, wherever you are from
It is for people who have been in New York for too long, and want to revisit restaurants without complicated ideas or sophisticated themes or creative cuisine
There is a 4-foot eagle on the bar
Black people go here for parties
The same CD plays daily -- Italian classics
If you don't get this place, it is because you are stupid
Although we were seated right away and the waiter brought menus promptly as well as drink, he was almost never at our table despite being at the other tables right next to ours
Tried to get fresh parmesean and our candle lit
Finally got powdery parmesean and no light
The food was ok, nothing special
Not a good value- overpriced for adequate food and- PAPER NAPKINS???
Top Italian in Park Slope, everytime I come in I am always greeted and the owner always makes sure that we get seated promptly, Keep in mind that it is a fairly small restaurant so sometimes it can get busy
The waiter was very attentive and always kept the bread and drinks coming
The food was excellent
I would highly recommend this restaurant, especially in the summer where you can sit outside
I will definitely keep coming back
We ate here on a Sunday afternoon
While our servers were generally friendly, our experience there was really pretty bad
While waiting for what seemed like quite a long time for our appetizers, our server came over and asked if we'd like dessert
That set off quite a bit of confusion, resulting in his needing to take our order again
Our appetizers arrived soon after, and a few minutes later were followed by our main courses
No one checked back to see if we needed anything, or if we'd like dessert
When it came time to get the check, they couldn't seem to determine which of the servers had it
Overall the experience was so bad that it was actually comical
Maybe it was an off day
but you're better off choosing another spot on 7th ave
We visited this place on Valentines day so maybe our experience was not typical since they were overwhelmed
Nonethless, and for the record, the service was dreadfully slow and eratic, though polite
The food arrived cold and had to be sent back to get warmed up, and the air-conditioning was blowing down our necks (and those of the nearby diners too) and freezing us to death
On a positive note, they did offer us a glass of free wine as we stood in line waiting for a seat (even though we had reserved a table!!)
I'd give this place a go anoter time and see what they can come up with when they are less rushed, but on days when I'd expect them to be rushed, I'd go somewhere else!
i've tried this plas 3x over the past month
and i've been nothing but pleased

Had a nice chat with the bartender and a great meal too
The cheeses are excellent and presented so nicely
The early bird special was a good value
We'll be back again and again
the staff is rude and clueless
i ordered three things and they were out of each
you would think that if they were out of something they'd tell you before you ordered, or at least after the 1st time you order something they don't have, or the second, but no they just acted impatient
they offer a list of cheeses but apparently only have three at anytime so your stuck with those if you wanted the cheeseplate
and they couldn't offer a description of any of them beyond it's a goat cheese etc
finally, the food took way too long for such a small place
Lovely evening! Delightful staff, delicious food and wine, dessert's a must! This is my new home cooking!
The most charming, comfortable place to come to this part of town
Our group consisted of 5 very big eaters who appreciate great food and every thing lived up to that expectation
The pot pie, pork chop and chicken were cleaned off the plates so well they didn't need washing
Our bottle of Icon was a great value of a wine and desserts, tripple chocolate pudding, home made ice creams, buttermilk chocolate cake and a chocolate plate were a terriffic sin
We'll head here regularly!
The General Store has wonderful atmosphere and excellent food and service
I've been thoroughly sated following each visit to the General Store
The sweets are to die for and I always find myself bringing something home to savor for the next day
Don't miss this place, it was a treat to discover and each visit is just as pleasant as the previous
Don't forget to try some of the chocolates, they are a sweet conclusion on the way home :-)
General Store has really good food
it's not GREAT
but I don't expect it to be
The food there tastes like something I could make myself on my best cooking day (and this is not a bad thing)
I had the pot roast (served in a skillet) and tried the lobster pot pie too (pretty tasty)
The cheese and cracker appetizers are really good
and a really good idea
haven't seen this appetizer option done in quite this way (with so much variety) anywhere else
Their dessers looks awesome
I only tried the banana caramel bread pudding
wasn't too impressed with that
Overall, I recommend it
can't complain about the service, and I think the price is right!
So happy to find this place
I could not have had a better meal! The food was outstanding, the waitress a real joy and the total experience was warm and wonderful
I can't wait to try brunch
The decor is very well done and welcomes you home
If you don't appreciate a great home cooked meal, don't come
I Loved it!
It's adorable and very clever without sacrificing delicious food and interesting choices for the original ambience and added bonuses such as a take-out bakery counter and parlor-style ice cream service
I would recommend to anyone and will definitly go again!
This restaurant was a real disappointment and what's up with the sticky varnished tables? The food is mediocre and the waitstaff is not so friendly
I have moved from Tribeca to the east village a year or so ago
It amazes me how many restaurant pops up every week inthis area
Most are bad and few are so GOOD
This one is not only fun, but the food is really good in an honest way
Not like a rsetaurant with a kitchen brigade, but like your mom's comfy and honest
You must try the soups and the Salads
All the main Courses that i have tried were really awesome thePork Chop, Bass, cod and the pot Roast were fabu
The dessert were rich and delicious
We took home some chocolates and some Lemon Curd which made very happey the next morning
Go and go again
I've come to this terrific little place since they quietly opened, only 3 months or so ago, about a dozen times
It has only improved since the start
The pace was a bit rough the first few experiences but the place seems to have ironed out the rough edges
My last few experiences have been outstanding
Hot deliscious comfort food in the American style
The biscuits are hot, flakey and only slightly sweet
My cod was cooked perfectly, the pork chop, meatloaf and tomato soup were great
Desserts a must, especially the BREAD PUDDING!!!
The first thing that threw me off is that there really is no kitchen
Everything is microwaved
With that said, there is no reason why the service should take so long, especially when the entire place is made up of 8 tables
We started with mushroom and asaparagus salad
nothing special
My girlfriend and I both had the lobster pot pie, it wasn't bad, but i do not think there was a difference in the amount of lobster between the full lobster or the half a lobster option
the side order of yams was not good at all and just tasted like buter
On to the deserts
best chocolate chip cookie i ever had
Home made ice cream was fantastic and the pecan pie was really good
In general for the general store, go for deserts or if you live in the neighbor hood, not worth going out of your way
I'd have to say that this is the best dinning around! I've not had a bad plate here yet
I've read some of the other reviews and have to agree ten fold that this is a great place, the quality and freshness of the food is unbeatable
I've been here on at least 6 occasions now and tried just about every thing on the menu
Not a loser in the bunch
The Hazelnut cake was slightly high in liqour, but I like to drink any way
The banana caramel bread pudding was out of this world
Every one is always friendly there too
I've tried this restaurant three times and am baffled by the rave reviews
My boyfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant and our dinner took over half an hour to arrive
I saw the cook in the kitchen microwave everything (including the pork chops)
The tomato soup was flavorless
The cheesy fingers were good; the only tasty thing I've had there
The brussels sprouts were overcooked and the mashed potatoes were nothing special
The chocolate hazelnut cake was a disappointment
The other day I took home two desserts
The chocolate buttermilk cake tasted like sour milk and the caramel banana bread pudding did not taste fresh
The staff was willing to exchange the desserts but treated me as though my complaints arose from an unsophisticated palate
I've given this restaurant more than a few chances and I have to say I'm not going back
The atmosphere was great - a really cute place to dine
Very small though- only about 8 tables, and they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait
The female bartender was very nice and helpful, but the waiter was awful- didn't even bring us water
Food was good- great tomato soup and meatloaf
Will definitely go back!
Just a lovely place! I am delighted with this new addition to my part of town
The desserts are wonderful
These folks have done a wonderful job in creating a little slice of home spun warmth to a very cold city
The comfort food is right on target
The staff was helpful and charming

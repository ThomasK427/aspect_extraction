This place has great food for take-away; their gyros, souvlaki and pizza (surprisingly) are all good
I remember they served wonderful square pizza with a slab of fresh mozzarella on it
However, unfortunately, this pizzeria seems to be sold over few years ago, and the new owner didn't get the recipe! If you wonder why this highly rated pizzeria serves average pizza, that's the reason
This family run place ranks at the top of none-brick oven places it has good balance a tasty sauce and good cheese
Formica rules and looks just as it did when it opened
Great while shopping Steinway Street
Some times they get behind on the pie flow and you have to wiat a long while for a new pie
This is the worst pizza in Astoria - cardboard smeared with ketchup and tastely cheese
I had to put pepperflake, garlic powder, salt, pepper, oregano and parmesan cheese on my extraordinarily expensive slice to make it edible
Ali is amazing
The combination plate appetizer, the pumpkin dumplings, kushari!!, this is the place I go to feed my soul
Tilapia or sole with Egyptian spices, the homemade yogurt with stewed fruits and spices for dessert
Coming here is like coming home!
Just a few months ago it was renovated and became my favorite colombian restaurant in the block
(La Pollera Colorada right in the same block used to be my favorite) The service is great, the food is delicious, and the service is fast
One of my favorite colombian restaurants in the city
(second to Mi pequea Colombia on Roosevelt avenue)
Definetely recomended
This place has been around for years
Family fave
The food is awesome, The menu is not that broad, but it is tasty
Good for a sunday- let -me take the family for dinner typre place
We go here all the time and never expect less
A classic!
Local hangout
Good American fare--liked the chicken dishes
Low sodium usage, which is great
I hate waking up the next morning bloated from the salt in last night's food
I go to this bar like every other weekend, and the people are great, great times great atmosphere
love the music as well, and the women that go here are very HOT
Wanna be Queens hall
Used to be a Great place BEFORE the IRISH DIASPORA of 2002-004
This is part of a couple of bars's that used to be excellent during the heyday of sunnyside-but that has ended
Now it is just a thug bar with local paid out protection- Not worth your money nor the extra spanish lessons now required
Still a good joint on Derby Day for some strange reason
I've eaten in Sidetrack's on numerous occassions
I LOVE the food
I've gone with groups of 3 - 15 people on different days times and never heard one complaint
The menu is a little limited but everything is fresh and delicious
As for the night club, I went on a Saturday night a few weeks ago
The music is pretty good Hip-Hop, RB, dance music and very few techno songs
The crowd is very mixed so you really have to see for yourself
I wouldn't mind going back, but not every weekend and I'd go with a group, not just 1 or 2 people
Definitely check out the restaurant, take a chance on the club
I read with disgust the review with the heading sidecraps
This disgruntled person is so far of base with their review that i had to set matters straight
a group of my friends and myself are in sidetracks every saturday night, and have never had a bad time
OK its gets busy but thats the fun of being in a nightclub
The crowd is mixed, the drinks are fairly priced for a nightclub and the DJs play a good selection of music
If this person had a bad time its their own fault
PS not everybody is a lowlife
What a dump!! I realise now that the only people giving this place good reviews are the same lowlives that make the club a disgusting combination of awful music, a scene out of a filthy rap video, and an environment that makes you wonder why they don't have metal detectors at the door
The place is darn right scary! This locale is all ghetto'd out, a combination of Corona, Washington Heights and Hell! Avoid at all costs!
Have been going to Sidetracks for over 4 years and while the food has always been exceptional, the crowd that started hanging out there in the last year is dragging the place to hell
It turned into a ghetto hangout on Saturday and Friday nights
shame really as it was one of the few places in the area that was good
Hell
even Blooms down the block has picked up on this and has been more selective at the door
Save your $$$
Or a date? Bring them here
I went last night with two friends and was very pleasantly surprised Dazie's lived up to the posted reviews
Even though you're a step away from the 7 train, you wouldn't know it from inside
There's a very nice sized bar, with a pianist(!)
Once you step inside you're entering a taste of Italy
Dining was literally an experience, even though we limited ourselves to entrees
In addition to the two rounds of drinks, the bartender and owner were a hoot
Let's put it this way - we left with roses
Looking at Dazies from the outside is deceptive of what awaits you inside
Be prepared for a very delighful surprise
From the ambience to the food everything is world class
It is so close to Manhattan that it is worth the trip and parking is easy
Be sure to make reservations as it is very popular
7 of us went to Dazies last night
There's a great selection on the menu and the specials were to die for
There's also an extensive wine list
Service was great, dishes were explained thoroughly
It has a very romantic atmosphere, we were the only large group there, the rest were couples
Gratuity is added on groups of 6 or more but the bill was surprisingly low for 7 people and the management offered us an after-dinner drink on them
There's a huge metered parking lot under the 7 train on Queens Blvd
You should have no problem getting a spot within 2 blocks of Dazies
I will be going back
you should too
I have been to Dazies twice and it was excellent both times
The food is delicious and they are very accomodating
This is a hidden jewel in Queens
being a Romanian is hard not to like this place
This locale has survived the ups and downs and closings of other restaurants
If you are keen on E
European cuisine, this is the place to go
I've been going to Ariyoshi for many years now and it's one of my favorite restaurants
They have a great menu selection and most of them are delicious! I recommend trying the Geso for appetizers, they're really yummy
Their rolls are really good as well and the entrees never disappoint
Their salad is also out of this world
They have a really friendly and accomodating staff
So if you're ever around the Long Island City area, make sure to check this place out!
In a neighborhood filled with many pubs and pizzerias, Ariyoshi stands out as a welcome option for those times when you are craving something light and a bit more nutritional than your average burger or slice
Passed it many times, and have always seen it filled so I decided to give it a go last friday
The result was fresh, tasty and promptly served - I'd definately return when feeling lazy and not willing hop the 7 into manhattan
I would like to retract my last review of Ariyoshi
In recent weeks I have been back and it was a major disappointment - and not a cheap one

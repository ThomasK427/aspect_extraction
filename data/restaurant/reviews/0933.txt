Sure it ain't fancy, but who cares?
I just got back from Daisy May's it is something to write home about, being from the South! I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich, which was huge, juicy, and tender
The sauce was very tasty, as was the slaw that I ordered with it
I loved the sweet tea in the Mason jar
As far as I'm concerned, the South would approve of Daisy May's
Very nice service as well
The only thing missing is seating, the smell of the pit, and country music
In Short Made from fresh, premium, all-natural ingredients, all the treats here are based on original Australian recipes; frozen treats are made fresh on-site throughout the day, chocolates are flow-in from Holland
Chocolates come in three styles: Dreamers are filled, Bonzers are exposed on top and Moods have more potent fillings
Gelato-style ice creams are kept at a lower temperature so you taste the flavor first, not the cold
Coffee, milkshakes and ice cream-infused hot chocolate round-out the menu
The ice creem is so creemy and so heavenly
The best ice c reem shop I've been to in memory
Beats even the best store-bought brands hands down
A bit expensive, but it's worth it!  (note: citysearch deems cre*m an inappropriate word to use in reviews, so I've had to spell it creem here
)
If you love ice cream, this new place will hit the spot
very creamy ice cream that is not too heavy but has just the right consistency
mix and match for some awesome flavor combos
this place does not disapoint
I was really looking forward to this place - both the ice cream and the chocolate dreamers
I have to say - it was good, but I've had better for both
Sorry, Australian Homemade
From the outside, it looks rather plain and white, but once you smell the inside, there's no escape
The chocolate smell is rich and they look even better
However, the ice cream is the real treat
Its not kept frozen, but close to room temperature so you get the real taste of the ice cream and not just the ice
The ice cream is rich and thick, packed with flavor and goodness
It really is a must try
I am an ice cream fanatic and this is hands-down the best ice cream I have ever tasted
They hand-dip waffle cones in chocolate for you when you order it, so it tastes super fresh and absolutely delicious and creamy
Their chocolates are also very good and are beautifully decorated on top
a great gift
Even if the East Village had a surplus of ice cream stores, this place would still be tops (bottoms?)
Ever since we lost Brooklyn ice cream on Avenue A, however, we've been suffering
Now, with ice cream from down under, we actually have the best ice cream in the city--well, except maybe for Busola on third--and certainly leagues ahead of (behind?) the disappointing Laboratorio
As you can see, the idea of Australia gelato takes a little getting used to, but the taste, texture, and freshness kind of knocks you over (under?)
The Scene On a well-traveled stretch of Avenue C, this storefront offers some of the most authentic Cuban flavors this side of the embargo
At a white-tiled bar, singles snack on tostones con ajo, fried plantains with an intensely garlicky dipping sauce, or sip sangria and mojitos as they await take-out orders
In the adjacent dining room, with low lights and bright Caribbean music, a young crowd squeezes into cozy tables
The Food A tempting and inexpensive menu makes it easy to try something new, and bollos, flavorful hush puppies studded with sweet corn and black beans, do the trick
Garlic lovers opt for the filling shrimp entree, camarones de ajillo, served with bread to soak up its soupy, well-seasoned broth
Skip the basic picadillo (traditional minced beef with rice) for the superlative cubano bocadillo with ham, pork, swiss, and pickles
The tres leches cake, soaked in milky sweetness, makes a fine finish
this place is worth coming for the pork sandwich (cubano) alone
after trying one last year, I am obsessed with cafecito's cuban sandwiches and feel the urge to go here whenever I'm in the hood
it's a great neighborhood spot, but service can be maddeningly slow when it gets busy
they also make killer mojitos at the bar
Great ropa vieja with an amazing minty and refreshing mojito
Incredible food and drinks at great prices
Try it out!
I live in Miami, which can arguably be called the Cuban food capital of the US, and visit NYC about 3-4 times a year
In between my visits I crave Cafecito's food
Seems silly being a native South Floridian and exposed to Cuban food my entire life that I would crave food that is so easily at my disposal
But there's something about Cafecito that's different
And I'm not the only one that feels this way
All of my friends make Cafecito a definite stop during their NYC trips
But why? The obvious point of distinction is their reasonable prices
But in my eyes, that should be it's the quality of the food that's obvious
It's amazing! My favorites include the Churrasco Steak accompanied with their version of the chimichurri sauce which perfectly blends the olive oil and parsley so there's not one ingredient that's over powering, atop their saffron rice with the side of cinnamon-glazed sweet plantains is hands down my favorite meal of all time
I also enjoy their ceviche tremendously
The flavors explode in your mouth and it's a very refreshing treat after a day of shopping
My review would not be complete if I didn't mention the Cuban Sandwich
Oh my gosh! The combination of fresh quality meat on that oh so crisp freshly pressed Cuban bread is perfect
If you haven't visited Cafecito yet, make sure to do so, you don't know what you're missing
Having grown up on Cuban food in the Union City area of NJ (a/k/a the Hialeah of the Northeast), I was always disappointed when I went out for Cuban food in New York
The small portions of not great-tasting food were always overpriced
So even after reading a great review in the New York Times, I was sure Cafecito would disappoint as well
Not the case! I went there on a date about three years ago, and although things didnt work out with the dude, it definitely worked out with Cafecito
The staff is always warm and welcoming
The food is perfectauthentic and savory, good portion size, and the prices cant be beat
The ambience is great for all occasions
And the drinks are always just right, too
It's true that sometimes you have to wait a bit for a table, but if you're in a hurry try going during off-peak hours
Go there with friends, colleagues, alone or with your mom
Just go
Youll like it
Invited friends for great food, especially cuban burgers and great mojitos
Had an expected 45 min wait @7:30 pm on a Saturday, not 2bad
Meantime ordered appetizers which took forever, second appetizer came right b4 being seated! But food was extraordinary as usual
What really bothered us, was the hosts pressure to spend $20 min
I never heard of that policy
Shouldve told us before we spent money at bar
We had minors who wouldnt spent that much (prices are low)
Figured hed consider what we spent at the bar, but nope
we werent even offered dessert b4 he came over to say we spent too littleannoying and embarrassing! Noone else was being reminded of this and my friends are pretty good spenders so we were offended
Doubt Ill be taking any local or international visitors there any time soon, Id hate to go thru this again!
not only is the food awesome, the prices are reasonable and it is very romantic
only downfall is you have to pay by cash
the service is awesome
the roasted chicken here was too die for and tostones - amazing
it wasn't too crowded
Cafecito is a cozy, warm environment and I have to say the drinks were very good but
I went there recently on a Friday evening with two friends and we were told a table would be ready for us within 5 minutes
About 30 minutes later, a table did open up, however the maitre 'd gave our table away to another party claiming they had been there longer (they hadn't)
About 45 min later we were finally seated
If it wasn't so cold out, we would have left and gone somewhere else
The food was about average, and we will probably not return to this place
Cafecito is an excellent little jem in the east village
From the atmosphere to the food - you will be amazed

the menu has changed a little and is now not only affordable but delicious
the most noticable difference was the great service
the staff was incredibly friendly and catered to my need to get to a movie on time, i even had time to try the best liquid center chocolate cake i have ever had! the ahi tuna and roasted duck breast entrees will melt in your mouth
Lousy service and mediocre food! Salads are dull and listless, main course burgers and hangar steak are just plain bad and the chicken sandwich looked horrible! This is a place intended to catch the Bloomie's shopping crowd and it should be missed by anyone looking for serious (or even decent!) food! Y-U-C-C-H!!!!
A little pricy menu, but the food itself is delectable
The pork and lamb on the menu are flavorful and absolutely melt in your mouth
The food is complimented by a fairly good selection of wine and the setting is romantic, yet casual as well, situated in a nicer part of town at the upper east
I have yet to try the Sushi upstairs, but this pick ain't bad
The food was good but the service needs a huge improvement, maybe a management
Tooooo Sloooooooow!!! Take it under a serious consideration!
We had an early reservation
(6PM) Was seated in the upper section
My friend thought the dinner rolls were a little cold
We both had the onion soup, which was excellent
My friend had the Sunday special, Lamb Shank, while I had the Sushi Entree
The lamb was done well and in good portions and the sushi was excellent quality
My friend ended with a 3 scoop mint sorbet and I ended the meal with a 10 year Twany Port
Excellent
If you're into California Rolls or can't distinguish a good Uni from a bad one, don't come here
You'll be wasting the Sushi Chef's time
If you're a big fan of the small sushi restaurant on Thompson St or the jewel on East 5th St, you've got to try Brasserie 360
The Toro Tare Tare with caviar, Botan Shrimp, Live Fish - Japanese Sea Bass and Uni Sashimi are phenomenal! If you agree with me, please let me know where else I can go in Manhattan for the same sushi experience
$102 for two people lunch
I DON'T THINK SO
My steak was filled with nerves and fat
75% of it had to be cut off
My friend's sea bass looked like it had dropped off a truck and fallen into a vegetable stew
PRETTY GROSS
Service was obviously apologetic for the quality of what they brought us
The remarkable thing about Brasserie 360 is the sushi bar upstairs
The brasserie is good
The sushi is among the best in the city
It's just odd to be experiencing it in what is otherwise a brasserie setting
Kazuo is a sushi master, and if you like sushi, you must go there
Actually, never mind
Stay away and leave my spot at the sushi bar open, thank you
The food was superb, classic French
The service was impeccable
Highly recommended
Let me break it down: Appetizers: Spicy Tuna, Yellow Tail Jalapeno, Tom Bas Moz roll - The Spicy Tuna tasted like it was made from canned tuna fish
Not up to what I would expect from such a notable sushi chef
Entree: Monkfish - Terrific
A great dish
Side: French Fries - Alright, Not special Drinks: Good
Service: Very friendly
Dessert: Apple Fritters - Good Donuts
Price: $110 (with tip 2 drinks) Would I go back?: Probably Not
Brasserie 360 is right next to my apt so of course I had to try it
My dinner here was pretty good
I had tuna tartar and salmon
Both of these dishes were very good and my boyfriend had the steak with fries
The steak was good, the fries were just ok and we both had dessert
The chocolate cake is great, but the apple fritters were not good and I wouldn't recommend them
The coffee was watered down and everyone was a little nervous, but it was only the second night
I will go back b/c of convenience and b/c I feel the food was good and it will only get better
French provincial fare for bon vivants with a taste for romance
Editorial Rating: Recommended The Scene Black-and-white photos on deep red walls and a mural that suggests the French countryside provide a fitting backdrop for this restaurant's rustic cuisine--along with a departure from the vintage wine posters that adorn many dime-a-dozen bistros
Chef and proprietor Jean-Frangois Fraysse, who opened West Chelsea's La Lunchonette, brings an identical menu to this borough branch, named after his hometown in southwestern France
The Food Everything on the southern French menu sounds scrumptious, but keep in mind before ordering a first course of dark and frothy lobster bisque, impeccably prepared scallops or tender duck confit with crisp greens, that Fraysse's hearty entrees are disarmingly large
The cassoulet's rich meat and bean stew makes an ideal winter dish; for a slightly lighter seduction, opt for the buttery skate with lemons and capers
Built-in sides include snappy peas and beans and sumptuous potatoes gratin
Try the apple or pear tarte tatin with just-sour-enough creme fraiche for dessert
I live in Park Slope and would love a place like this nearby
Nothing fancy or ambitious: just well-prepared, basic French fare at a reasonable price
The endive Rocquefort salad is large and plentiful, and entrees like boeuf bourgignon, cassoulet, and duck are more than serviceable
The wines by the glass are also good, as are the desserts
Nice atmosphere and service, too
I live around the corner from Quercy and I really hope that they do not suffer the fate of the previous occupants of this space
However, I must agree with the other reviewer about pricing on some items
I worked in a NY Times 3-star restaurant, and our price on Foie Gras, for both a terrine and a piece of seared foie, was the same price as they charge for one or the other at Quercy
This is not the way for a neighborhood place to endear itself to the neighbors
Most of ther menu is well priced and the food was perfectly good, however, it seems a little boring when four different entrees have the same green bean/potato sides
You have stiff competition nearby, and if you are to survive you must step it up
This restaurant is obviously by someone who cares
My entre was delicious
The wines by the glass were great
I look forward to seeing what they can do with this place
But,  the green salad should consist of more than a pile of arugula  the foie gras -appetizer- for $18 is a bit overpriced for this menu
I'd love to try it, but I'm not about to drop that kind of change for an appetizer
Cut the size in half if you must (I'll assume that's possible?)  ditto for the terrine, which is usually much cheaper than a foie gras ($16)  regardless, I wish them luck
The Scene If a group of rice pudding-addicted aliens ever set up a shop in Nolita, this is what it would look like
And the color scheme--bright orange, pink, yellow and stark white--along with neon lighting, tables suspended from the ceiling and a profusion of flat-screen TVs, makes it official: This is stimulation central
The Food You'd better like rice pudding, because that's all they serve
There are 18 flavors, plus three seasonal flavors, to choose from, with cheeky names like "Stubborn Banana" and "Melon-choly
" Some flavors, such as "Qualified Lemon" and "Strawberry Floozy," are so over-the-top and mega-flavored that a few bites are more than enough, though children may enjoy them
Grown-ups should opt for the mellower choices, such as "Endangered Maple" with tart blueberries, "Understanding Vanilla" and green tea with black cherries (a special)
This is a nice little place
We stopped by here before a concert at the bowery for dessert and shared a bowl with two flavors and I have to say, it was certainly a cool experience
I can see it not being for everyone, but I thoguht it was yummy
Beware, if you have a little bit of ADD in you, you might catch yourself staring at the weird animations on the tv's and the anime-like design of the place
Seriously, this place has the most intense interior I have ever seen in any fast-dessert place ever
Is it really necessary to have the menu on 42 plasma flat-screen HDTVs? Probably not, but it certainly looks cool
Every aspect of this interior was entirley well thought-out, even the instant ship to computer feels like you are aboard the Discovery with HAL 9000
Really cool place to bring friends from out of town to impress people with a one of a kind dessert that tastes really really good! However, BEWARE of the completely outrageously absurd minimum purchase to use a credit card
(20 bucks?!?!?!) Gimme a break
Saw it featured on Ellen and had to see it for myself
It lived up to all my expectations and then some
Just a great place! I'll be back
with a bunch of friends
my fave is their vanilla pudding with toasted brown sugar, nutty topping

Very romantic
Great date spot
Located in the former Asti
I had the least expensive steak on the menue and it was cooked to perfection
The sides were excelent
The service is professional and polite
if you are thinking of dining at a true new york steak house, dont eve think about dining here
try the Old Homestead or Sparks
this place was a disaapointment from start to finish
steak was average at best, appetizers were dissapointing, and service not good
Also had a 9 reservation and wasnt seated until 10:15
will never go back
I live in the neighborhood on 12th St
and decided to try Stip House seeing that it is a neighborhood, albeit expensive restaurant
I took my girlfriend there on a Friday night in the summer, thinking we wouldn't have a problem getting a table
Although it seemed like they had many tables available they stuck us in the front by the bar
The waitress was friendly, but distant and non-attentive
I started with a $16!! shrimp cocktail
The shrimps looked old and had a sheen to them that you see at an all you can eat buffet at Sizzler
The $35 strip steak was small and chared to a crisp although I asked for it medium rare
The bill was $145 and we didn't even order a bottle of wine
They should be ashamed of themselves for charging that kind of money for such poor service and bad food
I recently celebrated our wedding anniversary here and was extremely pleased with every aspect of the experience
The ambiance and attentive service was excellent for a romantic dinner
The filet mignon was the best I have ever had, perfectly pink on the inside with a nice charcoal crispiness on the outside
The side dishes were good but for some reason I had expected a little more from the celebrated goose fat potatoes I had heard so much about
The deep fried potatoes, however, were an unexpected nice surprise
Keep room for dessert! Their chocolate cake is amazing! I only wish I was able to finish it
This is not a cheap place but a great choice if you are looking for a romantic place for a date or celebration or you just want to enjoy the best filet mignon and chocolate cake you will ever have
Went to Strip House on a tip from our hotel concierge
Initial impressions were good due to the comfortable, relaxed, and sexy atmosphere
Service started out mediocre and continued to get worse
Our waitress, a French woman, served us with sterotypical French efficiency/friendliness (read: none of either)
By the way, is this a French owned restaurant? Something tells me it is
Anyway, the Lobster Bisque was superb, but our steaks were both overcooked and of average quality
Unfortunately the price was far above average
I'm basing my review on the new Livingston location in New Jersey
Based on the double strip and the rib chop, I saw that Strip House produces steaks exactly like their sibling steakhouse in Grand Central, Michael Jordan's
They were able to prepare one of the finest slabs of dry-aged prime beef I've eaten (I could live without the seasoning, however still excellent)
The creamed spinach, goose fat potatoes and lamb shank flan were all unique and extremely tasty
The salad was nothing to write home about
Strip House is not your typical steakhouse
I can understand why this restaurant has won so many compliments from so many well respected reviewers
the ambiance, the food, the people - they were all fantastic and made for a memorable night
I'll be back! Thanks Glazier Group!
My expectations were high, having had three excellent meals at the Strip House over the last year
Surprisingly, I was sorely disappointed in the lackluster performance last night
The steaks were supermarket quality, the appetizers carelessly-prepared, and the service haphazard
Further, the porterhouse for two was less-than-generous in size and the sides of marrow, roasted garlic, etc
showed evidence of having been reheated
Altogether, for $ 400 (w/$100 excellent wine) for a party of 3 with no drinks and one coffee, a poor value
I won't be back
Appeals to the 30 something but not over 40 crowd
High ratings are not for the food, or the genuine New York Steakhouse feel
If you want to ogle the ladies go to a real strip club and eat your steak elswhere
The service and food at this place are impeccable
We ordered the Porterhouse for 2 and was prepared tableside
The steak was one of the best I have ever eaten, highly recccomended
I just cant say enough good things about this place!!! It was the perfect first date spot!!! The atmosphere is so swank in a Swingers vibe
Its like going back in time and its decadent
The service definitely matched the prices and the food was simply incredible!!! My date and I could have easily split one of the Strips that we each ordered
Huge and perfectly prepared
The goose potatoe thingy was a little overrated, but very good
the coffee creme brulee was great and the suggested wine was excellent
Thank you StripHouse for making me look so good on my date
I dress very 'non-conservatively' and this was just the unstuffy (yet still classic looking) and hip steakhouse for the occassion
Perfect for a date or a family dinner or just the fellas
Wow! This place definately surprised me
One of the top steak places Ive eaten at
I had the jumbo shrimp for appetizer, the strip steak, medium rare and chocolate cake
I can't tell you how much flavor the steak had
It melted in my mouth
The atmosphere was great low lighting and great red vibe, with the bar area overflowing
Definately recommend
Wow! The food was great, plentiful, and the service was perfect
The decor made me feel like Liz Taylor should have been sitting across from me
Dark, red, luxurious
So 60's Hollywood
Not cheap but worth every penny
Romantic, delicious, sexy and attentive
I can't say enough
I recently went back and had such bad service that I had to lower my rating
We had to wait 40 minutes with a reservation
One entree was forgotten and we had to ask for bread and water refills
Atmosphere and food great
Go there every few months when I need a steak
Extras that go with a steak are perfect compliments
Remember to go when flush!
Do yourelf a favor and try the second best steak in NYC
Great vibe and great service
Wonderful rib steak
I can't rate the desserts, I've never had the room
Good service
The wall paper cracks me up
THIS RESTAURANT IS BEAUTIFUL, ELEGANT AND THE FOOD ROCKS! THE TRUFFLED SPINACH AND GOOSE FAT POTATOES ARE A MUST
I've never been to Peter Luger's, but if you are looking for an AMAZING steak without leaving Manhattan then you really must go to The Strip House! Excellent service, very cool atmoshpere, and fantastic food! The filet is to die for and the creamed spinish is amazing!!
My wife and another couple went to Strip House on Saturday night
We live in DC and take a trip to NYC every year at this time
They absolutely made our night
We arrived just in time to order the prix fixe dinner for $40 not mentioned on their website

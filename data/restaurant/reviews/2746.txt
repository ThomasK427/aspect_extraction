Go there you will enjoy it
Food is very expensive !!!!!! Its not the no 1 diner in the NY daily news
This is a good take out or eat little restaurant, but they are not Mexican
They make American and Italian food
They do make great burgers for the money and give big portions of fries with it
For quick easy take out this is pretty good
Nothing special, pretty standard diner
Open late
Food's ok, no bargain
it might be out of youre way but its worth the trip!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The food was fresh and delicious, the place is clean, and the workers are friendly
The prices are great and delivery is always on time
This pizzeria is the best on Bath Ave
This little neighborhood pizzeria is one of the best
Their pizza is always fresh and full of mozzerella and sauce
Their white pizza is to die for and their stromboli and chicken, sausage, meatball, and spinach rolls are the best
The even make great heros and Italian plates like shrimp or chicken parmagiana with baked ziti or lasagna or spaghetti or any italian specialty you like
Go there in person or call and order you won't be disappointed
They are very prompt when you call and place an order to be delivered to your home
Best pizza in Brooklyn
Grandma pie and marguerita pie are excellent
Spinache rolls have lots of garlic
Meat sauce is delicious
It's all good!
BEST PIZZA IN THE WHOOOOOOLE WORLD, YOU SHOULD GO AND GET THE MARGARITA PIZZA
We have been there a few times, there pizza's are great, resonably priced and good variety on the menu
In the bar area the sevice is 10x'a better than the dinnng room
They need more waiter's but the bartenders are GREAT! This is a great place to go for a snack before or after a movie or just to grab a beer
Okay
I must admit, my once favorite restaurant has changed! After a movie me and a friend decided to stop in and have a few drinks and appetizers at my old spot
Although we waited a minute or so to be seated
we watched while two separate parties waited over ten minutes, not only to be seated but for anyone to say We'll be with you in a minute! There was only one waitress, who actually tried her best to be quite attentive; for a Friday night, there should have been more waiters
The music was good; our appetizers were pretty good too
And I can still say Circles still ranks #1 for their frozen Magaritas!!!   My advice
Have patients with the lack of staff availabilty, go with fun and interesting friends, order a pitcher of frozen Magaritas and you'll leave Circles having had a pretty good time!
the food is terrible, the wait staff were extremely rude and it was overpriced
one female waitress took a serious attitude with me for simply asking for more water
do NOT go here, even if it is convenient after a movie
Yes, it's next to the movie theater and convenient, but come on! I had a caesar salad
I write that in quotes becuase iceberg lettuce, stale Pepperidge Farm croutons and bottled dressing does not a salad make
Fine if you want some mozzerella sticks or something else that nobody could mess up
Don't be fooled by the plain drab atmosphere
This place is terrific! The menu has a huge variety and EVERYTHING we've ever ordered has been delicious, served really quickly and by a very pleasant wait staff
I highly recommend this place
Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
This is a great place to go for a snack before or after a movie
Resonably priced and good variety on the menu
I like to get a bunch of appetizers here and share them
In Short The cozy, family-friendly spot hosts diners catching the game from stools at the tin-topped bar or relaxing at tables in the back
The menus spans from crab cakes and vegetarian chili to carrot cake and brownies, but most regulars come for the burgers and wings
Angus beef, catfish, and veggie burgers are topped with customized fixings, such as grilled jalapenos and chipotle mayo
Beef on Weck, a roast beef and horseradish sandwich, is a house specialty
this place is supposed to be the place for burgers, but i dont think so
the burgers are big, but dry even though i ordered medium rare
Its not cheap, it was $10 for a burger and fries, and when i was there, the waiter had dropped a FULL glass of coke on a patron, soaking her through! she was really cool about it though :) i didnt think this greasy spoon was anything to brag about
plus this place looks none too clean
There isn't much to say about Bonnie's that hasn't been said before
Situated right next to Blue Ribbon (whose burger is also worthy of honorable mention) Bonnie's is the perfect place to go for great burgers in a friendly casual atmosphere
The whole staff is very friendy and remind you of people that you have known forever
Great food by people who actually seem to care about what they do
The jalapenos and the onion rub on the burgers are a great touch
the chicken wigs are delicious!!! and the burgers can be shared by two people!
Whenever we're hungry and don't know where to go, we inevitably wind up at Bonnies
The food is OUTSTANDING! (My personal favorite is the vegetarian (!!) chili cheese fries and their spicy burger) The service is typical diner service -- nothing outstanding, but they try their best to accommodate
Best advice is to go either early or late, especially on weekends -- they're typically slammed between 7 and 9 PM, and may not even pick up the phone during those times, since it gets so hectic
Otherwise, a FANTASTIC meal awaits!
Their wings are great and they make them hot! Plus they have pitchers to wash it down, and the beer is usually something local and decent
Stay away from the Beef on Weck though
Love the fries and the dipping sauce
Seriously, the best
I was skeptical, but it's true
Nice spice to everything
The spicy Cole Slaw is a must
As are the VEGETARIAN chilli fries
Casual atmosphere with nice, normal service!
Sports on TV, GREAT food, GREAT beer, and a sexy head chef
what else is there to say except get your ass down to Bonnie's and grab some wings and some catfish or burgers or pulled pork or whatever and wash it down with a few pints!!  If you are from buffalo you might even want to head over and watch the Bills try to play football while you try to stay clean eating some beef on weck - you know what I'm talking about
The place is great and it is VERY affordable
They have some veggie stuff for the veggies and some game for the carnivores and a collection of hot sauces that will keep you burning well after your visit if you like that kind of thing
Good food, good people and good times
What are you waiting for?
if you go there for the service, forget it, not that it's bad for this particular establishment
The burgers/wings are just what you want, some decent beers also
O

its litely seasoned, but theres a wide range of condiments to chose, add your own special touch
I love hamburgers
That said, I am not a foodie
I like my burgers from medium to well-done and I like them without lettuce, tomato or exotic genre-bending sauces, just onion and occasionally cheese
For my bet, Bonnies is the best burger in the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill/Park Slope districtfrom what I've experienced from 4 years living in New York
The beef is high-quality, well-but-lightly seasoned, and the bun and fries (served with plentiful rich chipotle mayonnaise sauce) are top notch
The atmosphere is midwestern-styled very polite indifference, this is not a place to expect pampering, but the staff are efficient, friendly and will remember frequent visitors
The burgers are wide, but thinner than that of Junior's
I love it, I will go again and again
Weekends are crowded, try it out early in the week, they don't hurt for business but are a must for the burger-loving mid-hipster Brooklynite
The service is great, the food is fantastic and the catfish burgers are amazing! It's horrible that a place like this gets overlooked in the Best of New York issues of NY-based magazines while the same old tired overrated restaurants get picked year after year
If you live in this neighborhood, go to Bonnie's while it's still a well-kept secret
My brother and I go to Bonnies often
This place is not only great for burgers but they also make great wings(the best in nyc) even better than Down the Hatch in Greenwich village
Their pulled-pork sandwich is the best you will find at least in the Northeast

We ended up hanging out for a few hours at their bar with a staff that we felt like we've known for years
A gem of a find this place is
We'll be going back, and recommending it to all of our friends
ive been a fan of the lower east side for bars for quite some time
but there was never a really 'cool' place to hang out until i found the sunburned cow
youd never know it from the outside but when youre in the mood, this place is hoppin
the food is delicious, the bartenders are hot, and the music rocks from the djs
you can even play video games at the bar on the big screen! i'm so happy i found this place
my friends and i are going to become regular aussies very soon
well done mate!
Food is fantastic, but since they switches to Tapas-style dishes (same food, only less of it), the prices don't make much sense
We were 4 people, ate 6 dishes in 7 minutes (after waiting 45 minutes) and felt we'd just had appetizers
Service is super-friendly but super-slow
Expect to sit without a drink for 10 minutes or longer depending on how busy it is
Sunburnt Cow's teriffic staff made me homesick for Sydney! Fantastic food and a really interesting bar and dining room
This is going to be my new hangout for sure
Great music
This place rules
delicious food, great service, laid back atmosphere
Every request is met with no worries and not in the Outback chain sense! Some people are put off by the paper plates
but i say bring it on
I'm cool with them saving on china and passing the value along to us! Try the barramundi
scrumptious
its a simple place, with a lot going on
we've been there 3 times and feel like part of the family now
every time we discover something new,moo juice, real australian meat pies, a burger with the lot, fantastic ossie wines stumbled in their xmas eve, to a party to remember great dj love the cow!!
Great food, great service, cool people awesome atmosphere
The kicker though, for me was Mad Max play on a big screen in the bar
Kick ass!!!!!
found this place for a late lunch
great curry chicken sandwich
interesting back patio - curious what it would be like for lunch
Good wine
Overall quite reasonable
My first and last visit! Walked in on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only customers in the restaurant
Although, there were four waiters and a manager working, we were ignored, rushed to order and treated like a nuisance
The icing on the cake was having a mistake on our bill and then having the manager argue out loud with me about a side order of Nan bread! I was outraged, not about the couple of dollars, but on the horrible service
Would not recommend to anyone!
Ordered a vegetarian dish which is traditionally not very spicy
When I wanted to exchange it after taking one bite and realizing that it was very hot, management refused to exchange the dish saying, What do you want me to do? Serve it to someone else? Incredible
Absolutely no customer service
I would never go back again/
Go for brunch! 3 courses for the price of one! Enough food for 2 meals! Its amazing! I love this place!
My girlfriend and I have been here twice, we had the same experience on both occasions
We had the weekend brunch special, which is a great value
The appetizers were very good, but the chicken entrees (Vindaloo, Kurma, Manglorean, etc
) were rather tasteless
The Tandor entree might be worth trying
We frequent swagat, as it is consistently delicious!! The staff and management are excellent
Our favorites are their Tikka Masala and Naan
I wholeheartedly recommend swagat, you WILL get addicted!
This is a small, cozy restaurant
The food was great!!! Mango curry (i forgot its indian name on the menu) is a must and their tanduri, appetizers and deserts were also great
Service was really friendly and atmosphere was amiable
I don't know how the others would think about this place but I will definitely want to recommend this place to my friends!
Expecting the typical heavy laden sauced, undistinguishable tasting Indian food
Friend recommended to try the restaurant
We were surprised to find clean tasting, flavorful dishes
Each ingredient could be tasted, not masked
The place for Indian on the UWS for us
We love this restaurant, not just because of the flavorful food, but the employees are charming and kind
The atmosphere is cozy and a bit lacking in decor, but it is, in a sense, romantic
Great food
This place is fabulous -- the best Indian on the upper west side
The food is delicious! And the service is excellent
We like the atmosphere, very quiet and relaxed
Definitely try this nice little Indian restaurant -- you will not regret it!
My mother and I had a wonderful lunch at Swagat a couple of months ago
At that time it was pretty new to the neighborhood
The menu was fairly extensive for a small place, and the food was delicious; but the warm and helpful service definitely set it apart from other restaurants
I will definitely be back
Swagat is a small little Indian Restaurant in the middle of a bug block, just wating there for someone to come in and eat its great food
I happened to pass by and saw this restaurant and wanted to check it out
The first time I went it I was greeted with pleasure and enjoyed my time
They had great appetizers
My favorite was Shrimp Pandochery
It had a great sauce which made me order another dish
The chicken entree I ordered was Chicken Darampur, it was the best Indian chicken dish I had ever eaten
Maybe it was the chef or other restaurants did not make anything like this
And for desert I had was an Indian Ice-Cream called Kulfi
It was very nice
I hope more people go there and enjoy the great meals they serve with excellent service
I will go again and try more dishes
Swagat offers the best lunch deal in Mahattan
It offers lunch specials for $6
99 which includes selection of any lamb, chicken , or veggies served with nan/basmati rice/tossed greens
The waiters will offer more rice or bread if you need
I have been to dinner at Swagat many times and realized that its main course is actually 20% lower then any other neighborhood restaurant
I highly recommend this small but beautiful restaurant
The Scene The Time Warner Center's crown jewel surrounds diners with detailed luxury: soft cream leather on the walls, brass and copper tiles on the floor, and tables dressed with layers of fine linens
Service is among the best in the city, and diners are attended to with aplomb
The Food As the internationally acclaimed chef of the French Laundry, Thomas Keller has earned a reputation as a perfectionist
Diners benefit from the first taste--miniature sesame cones topped with a scoop of buttery salmon tartare, which arrive as a gift from the kitchen--to the last, gracious nibbles of homemade truffles
In between, dishes like "liver and onions," buttery, tender ramps with lush duck liver pt; Keller's signature "oysters and pearls" made with tapioca, just-warm oysters, sweet butter and a wealth of caviar; and the genius combination of foie gras, peach jelly and--unexpectedy--young cilantro leaves, sweep diners off their feet
This is an amazing place, but it would be best to understand exactly what your getting into
You will get the $210 prix fixe menu, because there is no other choice
It comes with 9 courses and it took our group about 5 hours to dine
The wine list is very expensive so expect even a low end bottle to be over $100
That said, service was flawless and the food excellent
I found they didn't take enough culinary chances for my taste buds, and since others had made the plans, I wasn't prepared for the enormity of the evening, or the bill

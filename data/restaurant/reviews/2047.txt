The place is quaint and comfortable with nice waiters
I have been eating brunch at Home for a couple of years
I have tried the pancakes, french toast potato cakes and omelet
Its always consistenly excellent
The bacon is incredible
Oh, they have the best coffee this side of seattle! I highly reccomend it
A good value too
My wife and I read about Home when they first opened, tried to go but could never get a reservation
We finally, after many years, went home again and had a very nice evening
We were sat in a cozy booth and ate delicious trout and a wonderful pound cake
The service was freindly
We plan on returning soon
I was visiting NY from out of state with my sister and had read about Home in a travel guide so thought we would try it
Everything was very good, especially chocolate pudding!
Had a great pan fried flounder last night (fri) and my freind had the scallops
Both Delicious!
I surprised my girlfreind and took her to Home Restaurant for a romantic dinner last Saturday night
It was cold and rainy and Home offered a perfectly comfortable atmosphere and delicious food
We especially liked the hot and oozing blue cheese fondue! Our waiter helped us pick a tasty New York wine, our first and was otherwise very attentive to our table
We felt pretty special
I called for last minute Sat
night reservations at this restaurant because of a recommendation by a friend
When I called a polite gentleman answered the phone and took my reservation
I was then asked if I knew how to get to the restaurant
Wow, I didnt even think of that
Greenwich Village can be difficult to navigate so I thought the offering of directions to be a nice touch
We were seated on arrival and ordered some wine
very good New York wine
The food was excellent
simply prepared and with a great deal of soul
So comforting to taste something that isnt fusioned to death these days
The service was exceptional, gracious and accomodating
Home Restaurant delighted my friends that evening and I'm thankful to my friend for recommending it to me
Thanks Janey!!!!!!!!
I have been dining at Home restaurant for almost 5 years now and have had nothing but positive experiences
Last night (Sunday) was a good example
We went with freinds who brought their 6 year old son
Almost immediately the staff engaged him in conversation and brought him a delightful top to play with
Needless to say it occupied him for the rest of the evening, allowing the rest of us to enjoy the delicious food and wine
I just had dinner last night at Home for the first time and was wowed by the whole experience
We ate delicious locally oriented food and drank a wine from a local vineyard
Our waiter seemed well versed on the menu and answered all of our questions politely
The place is quite narrow, like many Greenwich Village spots, but this seemed to only add to the ambiance
My wife and I left delighted and will go Home again, and again!
This place, although the food was not half bad, has the worst service I have ever had in NYC
Being a server in the past, I have to say that you are better off staying home (Unless you are really craving an over-priced entree like scallops that figure out to be about $5/scallop)
I find it humerous that a place calls intself Home
This is a very apt assessment if you grew up in a rude, unfriendly and inept household
Home, that's a simple recipe:  Take two parts poorly made meals, overprice everything
mix together in severely cramped conditions,  Add about four to five stupid, cold waiters / waitresses and voila, you're home!  four waiters for four tables - all two tops and not one person asks how the food is?  no one brings coffee?  I'm glad this isn't my home and I don't recommend that you make it yours
I've heard such hype about HOME that I took someone there on a 2nd date
Several friends had warned me that the portions were small -- REALLY SMALL -- and boy were they right! Completely overpriced, especially for the miniature portion sizes, and just so-so as far as flavor goes
I had the chicken, which was all of a tiny little leg, wing, thigh, and smalllllllll breast
It was like a miniature cornish hen
Apparently the burger here is really good, but you can only get it at lunch
Very disappointing experience
ALso, there was no music playing when we were there, and the entire crowd seemed hushed because it felt like everyone was listening to your conversations
Two of us went for brunch
The food was pretty good but the portions were smaller than what I would expect for brunch
The service was slow and the servers seemed quite edgy
We had to wait for menus as did other guests as for some reason they didn't have enough to go around
Overall, the dining experience was good but not good enough to make us go back
don't sit outside!!!
the benches have little nails protruding
ripped my pants
and the staff at the restaurant didn't care!
This is one of those places with a very specific one-page menu of trendy fusion food
If you like that sort of thing, you'll feel right at Home
For what it was, the food was decent, and service and ambience were nice, but not exemplary
The homemade ketchup is fantastic, though
I had a very enjoyable dining experience at Home last night
Took a date
Great atmosphere for a date
Great comfort food
Fresh
Unique cause so much of the ingredients are local
Comfort food with class
Service was lacking a little
I liked this place for breakfast
They have awesome pancakes with fresh fruit
In Short The Cuban outpost joins the ranks of intimately spaced restaurants on this historic street
Guests relax at softly lit square tables inside the 19-seat restaurant
A bright Caribbean mural painted in oranges and greens captures a Cuban landscape, while the menu renders traditional cuisine, with additional chorizo available with every item
Choices include shrimp seviche salad, ropa vieja (shredded steak with rice and beans), roasted salmon with tostones and a Cuban flan denouement
We went on a scorchingly hot night which may have been our only mistake
It was hotter inside than outside with one a/c unit barely working above the door with two ceiling fans
The shrimp ceviche was delicious, the lentil soup fair
The arroz con pollo forgettable, the ropa vieja was good
The sangria one person ordered never came but was on the bill
The service was painfully slow
Viva Cuba!
Don't be fooled by appearances
Barely larger than a New York City living room, Little Havana is easy to walk by on a street that boasts some of the Village's more upscale, more decorative restaurants, but it is undoubtedly just as good
You'll find no frills, flavorful Cuban food in an atmosphere that doesn't try to win you over with appearance alone
The table next to us was overbearingly loud, and as a courtesy the waitress brought us over a free half-pitcher of sangria
The flan's consistency was perfect and the salmon was light and tasty
I highly recommend this place for an unexpectedly delicious experience
My friend lives nearby and eats here all the time, it was my first time trying it out
I ordered the ropa vieja, she had the roasted salmon and we shared a pitcher of sangria, which was really good
Looks are deceiving, my ropa vieja looked like a dry small portion, but it was filling, and so tender and tasty

the atmosphere was perfect for a late evening dinner
atomic wings charged $1/wing on the superbowl, for tiny, tasteless wings
I would not recommend this place
On time delivery, decent service, but there is no reason to pay that much, especially since their menu says something different than they do on the phone

and the wings weren't even that good, man
Disappointment!
Okay, when my friend told me about it, I was skeptical
But Atomic Wings really delivered! Usually, a lot of wings just aren't spicy enough for my tastes
but with 6 or 7 different levels of spicyness, you can tailor it to your taste
Atomic, nuclear, suicidal
Yum, yum, yum! And the Chicken Littles are great if you're having a party and you don't feel like dealing with the bones in normal buffalo wings
The fries are good too! (And they deliver in, like, 10-15 minutes!)
We were fairly pleased with the wings at Atomic
The medium hotness suited us fine, and the fench fries were really tasty
The wings were huge compared to other places we have been
The only thing we would improve is that the wings were a little undercooked
Other than that, thumbs up for atomic
I have to say that this place has the best wings in NYC
Presentation exceeds expectations of even the top rated wing joints in NYC
If you want perfect wings, this is defintely the place to go
I did find the service a little slow, but it was worth the wait
The pros far outweigh the cons
The waitstaff is very friendly and courteous, the service is prompt and attentive
The food is always excellent and beautifully presented
Although I have not been to Esashi for a while I'm sure it is still the quiet neighborhood sushi place that I visited six months ago and before
They usually have interesting specials, fresh fish, and reasonable prices
Like I wrote about Kura Sushi if you are looking for ambience and cocktails go to Sushi Samba
If you want great sushi, then you will be more than happy w/Esashi
I'm always a bit wary when trying new Japanese restaurants as living in NY has spoiled me silly
I was pleasantly surprised by the food at Esashi
had tempura udon special and grilled cod appetizer, both of which were excellent
sushi was nice, too, but cut in large pieces
not meant to be a complaint, and some may find this a plus
it is run by Japanese and was not at all crowded when we went
they offer early bird specials before 7:00pm
would definitely come back for more
Great sushi restaurant, rarely crowded, great value
Sit at the bar and eat here regularly and the sushi chef who is also the owner will hook you up the best cuts of fish
I highly recommend trying the blue fin fatty tuna and the sea eel
Many of my friends I introduced to this restaurant have become regulars
The food is tasty, in a fried chicken kind of way
And super, super cheap
It takes a little while for them to cook stuff though - they don't seem to have a bunch of food ready for eating
They're also open really late, which is an added bonus
i sat shiva when the upper east side location closed
david's is by far the best bagel in the city
awesome spreads, killer sandwiches and shockingly friendly service
the stores don't offer much as far as decor or ambience, but hey, these are bagel shops
don't believe the hype about tal's, ess-a-bagel or hot 'n crusty -- david's beats them all
Bagels and cream cheese that are better than anywhere else and served without the attitude that the other popular bagel shops have
no one rushes you, everyone smiles
It is quite a refreshing change, and a well-priced one too!
Got to be the most underrated bagel in the city
Upper East Side location closed, leaving the East Village store as my only remaining alternative to overrated joints like Tal Bagels
These bagels are quite possibly the best in the City
And they even have different varieties of tofu cream cheese (scallion, sun-dried tomato, vegetable) -- great for the lactose-intolerant and vegetarian alike
Big, chewy bagels
And the service is quick and smiling
We got delivery from Fei Ma - it was quick and cheap, but the food is not good - the dumplings were not cooked and very doughy, the soup and noodels was tasteless, and the Schezwan Chicken was just slop
As far as delivery goes, Fei Ma has been nothing but fantastic
They are very quick and the food is always perfect
It's excellent chinese food
I highly recommend the hot and sour soup which is perfectly flavored and chock full of meat and vegetables
It can make a great meal on it's own
Everything they have is very above average and the prices are fairly standard
A friend of mine lives right across the street and a bunch of us met for dinner
We didn't order appetizers because we wanted to leave room for dessert - although we wound up not ordering any
I got the pizza and split it with my boyfriend
It was DELICIOUS
The Steak Piazzola that my friend ordered was good, also
but ask for pasta instead of potatos
It's weird to have potatos in an Italian entree
Even the simple spaghetti bolagnase was delicous
The wine is very decently priced
Our entire dinner for six people only cost $135
Lanza's was sold after the owner passed away and I hate to say it but it's not what it was
The service is fantastic as it always has been
However, traditional lovelies such as Prosciutto y Melon wound up tasting like dried ham and overripe melon
Entrees are not much better
I strongly recommend that if you have been here before you think before going back
Sorry to see the old place in this state
Atmosphere and service are still great though
A group of 10 friends and I made reservations for the night of June 7
Upon entering the door of Lanza the manager guessed our party and was already leading us to our table
Service was fast and friendly, even custom-making a few dishes
I ordered the shellfish assortment in marinara sauce over linguine, and all I can say is wow
The shrimp were perfect, the calamari was fresh and tasty, and the clams were delicious
My friend ordered the salmon over linguine and her dish was amazing as well
The salmon was cooked to perfection, well done but still juicy and tender
For the group of 11 of us, our total tab ran $225, including everything (meal, tax, and tip)
Since we're underage, I can't attest to the drinks here, but I can say the food and the service were perfect
A certain return is in the future!
The Scene This East Village restaurant never gets a wink of sleep, and the decor recalls an insomniac's late-night, Technicolor dreamscape
Zebra, cheetah and colorful floral patterns cover every inch of wall, low-lit by strings of Chinese lanterns and dangling grapevine lights
It's so out there that it works--black-clad raver waiters and all--and even the most normal of groups love getting together for dinner and popular brunching on the palm-lined backyard patio spread
The Food The mishmash menu was built to satisfy a scene of late-night cravers--come here expecting impressive dining and you're missing the point
A hearty bowlful of pesto-drenched fettuccini pasta is thrown together with a chicken curry dish--hardly authentic, but sweet and mild
Vegetarians beware the Sunshine burger, served sans toppings to disguise its mushy cafeteria mystery
All come with a tasty Asian carrot dressing salad, including the mimosa brunch of smoked salmon eggs benedict, with a somewhat crude hollandaise

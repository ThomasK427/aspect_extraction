Exceptionally balanced dishes, great wine selection, superlative setting and atmosphere
Look at the service, the polished stemware and attention to detail
Just the way a sophisticated Italian restaurant you might find at Verona or Bologna
Pricey? Not for this quality!
Excellent food, staff, and decor
The wine list is incredible
We held a small party of 10 and the restaurant was very accommodating!
First time here
Food was excellent and the wait staff could not be better
You were catered to and not rushed
Staff was eager to make recommendations/suggestions and answered all questions with knowledge
Decor reminds me of eating establishements I've been to in Italy
Food again was not just a name on the menu but very well made and fresh
Some items I've only seen previously in Italy
Pricey but worth it for that special moment
My first impression when I walked in was Wow this place is so romantic and the wine list has top bottles from around the world with a large Italian selection
The owners are from Verona, Italy and also import their own line of glass
The entire table was filled with gorgeous stemware which you can also order
Food was gourmet and good to last bite
The decor was stunning with every single thing imported from Italy
Downstairs I saw a wine tasting going on in a large banquet room
Right near Central Park and a parking garage across the street
This is the place to propose to your girlfriend, hands down
Absolutely perfect setting for that!
it has the feel and flavor of italy
can't miss
One visit was all I needed and now I am obsessed with this restaurant
The ambiance is phenomenal; all the painted wooden columns and authentic tables make you feel as if you have been transported to a small village in Italy
From the moment you walk in the door, the staff is eager to please you every need, but they don't even need to try because once you get your food life is complete
I would also recommend visiting Bottega for a casual lunch; their sandwiches and cappuccinos make a perfect afternoon snack
This restaurant was a culinary delight
The ambiance was beautiful and the service was impeccable
The food was well worth every penny, as it was delicious
The wine list was beyond impressive
I highly reccomend this restaurant
In a city filled with restaurants
we no longer go out to eat just for the food but also for the experience of it
Bottega Del Vino is truly like visiting Italy
Be prepared to sip the finest wines and dine on such splendid flavors as the Torellini Bottega (hand-made tortellini filled with prosciutto, veal and beef in a porcini-butter sauce -- it is to die for!), and Constoletta di vitello al gorgonzola (Veal)
Be sure to finish up with a cup of cappucino -- it is the best in the city
The staff is well-informed and very helpful
Be sure to ask to view the wine cellar on your way out
Bottega Del Vino is romantic but also great for a large groups
The wine cellar would be a wonderful place to throw a private dinner
I walked by this place several times without realizing it was a restaurant
This must be one of the few unknown gems left in this city
I came here for lunch
We were seated immediately, without a reservation
The waiters were extremely courteous and very serious about formalities
That said, they were not snooty and I am extremely pleased with the service
The food was spectacular
The whole seabass was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had
I am told both the snapper and the risotto are also good
Many if the times on the menu include a pork product of some kind, but there are plenty of non pork items as well
The decor is very pleasant
The prices are certainly expensive, but in my opinion absolutely worth it
I will keep this place in mind for important and special occasions
Went there for my birthday
Service was very slow, especially when waiting for our drinks (no bartender, bad mistake)
No bread basket for the table, the server came around with a basket and we each got 1 piece of bread
Food was good but portions were quite tiny
For the prices they charged the portion sizes and service left much to be desired
Actually it was awful
Will not be going back
Though the food had not impressed us before, decided to give it another chance and made reservations for Easter lunch (two adults, one infant), arrived on time, were mistreated by the wait staff who refused to give us a high chair (though we'd requested one with our reservation) but also would not allow us to keep the stroller next to our table
We sat for twenty minutes completely unattended
The waiter was rude when we insisted about the high chair though the restaurant was almost empty and there were high chairs available
We left before ordering because the situation was so uncomfortable
Quite a disappointment
We just celebrated Nancy's Birthday after a day at the Bronx ZOO
This was a perfect end to a great day
Just 10 minutes away from the Zoo - easy parking and close to the highway for the trip home to Long Island
More importantly this was a first class dining experience that rivals the ZAGAT top 10 list
Our 2 year old son had a fantastic time, as Chef/Owner/Dad Michael was a very accommodating host
You can bring your kids and feel comfortable and relax and still enjoy first class cuisine - very unlike the Manhattan Upscale scene
Amazing food, impressive wine list, and great service and reasonably priced
We are anxious to come back when it gets warmer to enjoy the garden
It's worth the trip!
Riverdale Garden is a wonderful restaurant, the wine list has the ability to be both sophisticated and non pretentious, the food under Chef Michael Sherman is possibly the best New American that NY has to offer, and not as pricey for better quality in many downtown restaurants
The menu changes frequently and all items are fresh with local ingredients
The ambiance is romantic and cozy, from the woodburning fireplace and sofas (great for dessert which is decadent and homemade) as well as the patio and garden in the back
Its worth the trek from another borough
I am so happy that something so wonderful is right around the corner from where I live
Riverdale Garden is a must try for everyone
Finally, a place for really good, intelligent food and wine in Riverdale
Chef/owner Michael Sherman has created a charming, comfortable oasis at the end of the No
1 Train
The spacious interior is laid-back and friendly, with tile floors, oversize wooden chairs, a hodge-podge of art, and wrought-iron light fixtures
Delicious cuisine emphasizes fresh local ingredients and is prepared with great care
Don't skimp on dessert
Not cheap, but much better value than many Manhattan eateries
In winter, the wood stove; in summer, the lovely garden out back
The well-credentialed chef provides an excellent menu, of which no item we tasted failed to please us
We had the reasonably priced 5-course meal created ourselves in consultation with the chef
We drank our own wine keeping the price low for the quality of the experience
The Chef appreciated our offering him a 1/2 glass of '90 Montrose, showing interest in both his customers and in expanding his horizons
I recommend this restaurant to those with sophisticated palates desiring a fine meal amongst nice people in an inviting atmosphere where the background music is so blessedly soft that one must actually try to hear it in order to do so
We wanted a cocktail and then dinner
No bartender in the not very inviting bar!   There was an uneveness in the restaurant, from the decor right through to the food and service
Service was SLOW

All though not filled to capacity the energy was great
The ambience incredible
the place is beautiful
The lighting, brick, woodwork and the big comfy chairs give the place a real homey feel
After the bar, they sat us on the side with the wine room with a nice view of everything
Since there was so much to choose from we decided to do our own tasting and share everything
We ordered beef carpacio app it was a tad salty but I realized it was the bacon and somehow that evened the flavor for me
The mushroom flan
it's an experience and a good one at that! And the beet and blue cheese, that had a nice flavor on the tongue when you take a bit of everything from the plate
For dinner we decided to share on the Veal Cordon Blue (wow) and the Artic char, a nice dish
We also got a side of the creamed onions and the potatoes
We liked both sides, but I loved the onions
Yes we were a bit full, but happily
Overall we really enjoyed everything
There were a few kinks here and there along the way, but
well worth it
Everyone seemed nice, helpful and knowledgeable about the place and the food
We'll be back for sure and maybe we'll save room for dessert
Devin Tavern is proving to be a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and I look forward to returning! The space is pristine yet cozy with exposed brick walls and working fireplaces and offers comfortable and amply spaced seating
The food: for apps, my friends and I tried the tuna tartare, the shrimp and grits, the corn souffle/lobster bisque, and the bruleed (yummy!) foie gras
I highly recommend every one of these
The shrimp and grits are absolutely outstanding, offering the perfect balance of salty/sweet, and the corn souffle/lobster bisque is as delectable as it is unique
I look forward to revisiting this one when the fireplaces are going!  For the entrees, be sure to try the short ribs - they're off the charts! The Kansas City sauce is delicious (my one complaint was that I wished I had more!), and the meat was perfectly cooked
The lamb proved to be the best I've ever tried, and the filet had a fabulous crust
The lobster club was a great pick as well, with large chunks of lobster in the sandwich and a full claw on the plate to boot (making it hard to balk at the $29 price tag, which I initially did)
The wine list is refreshing and different with its New World focus, which seems perfectly apropos, given the rustic American cuisine
The list seems carefully crafted, with an appropriately diverse and interesting selection, ranging from boutique South American wines to some of California's best - I remember seeing some of my faves like Cakebread, Duckhorn and Talbott and had a bottle of the Etude myself
The service was outstanding - our servers were knowledgable and friendly, making the restaurant's refined service style more comfortable than confusing and more service-oriented than pretentious
I literally can't wait to return
what's it got going for itself
the space is fantastic, tables are evenly spread out and the rustic fireplaces are a charm particularly in the fall
Money has been lavished on the interior
It feels like a New Hampshire log cabin
Unfortunately the service while earnest was scatty and disorganised with waiters and waitresses arguing among themselves over their respective sections
The staff tension was palpable and unnerved us as diners
Food pairings were particularly confused among appetizers
Balsamic drenched, overly salted westphalia ham and pickled pineapple was a clashing mess of flavors, acidity and texture
It was the worst form of bric a brac menu assembling
I asked for my filet mignon to be served medium
It turned up cold and raw and my side order of sauteed mushrooms got lost en route -- I was stunned as I have never had anything but excellent steaks from Dylan Prime the sister restaurant
The wine list tried to cover far too much geography with maybe two or three varietals from any given region
In a city where diners won't blush at 300% markups the prices here are breathtaking
Clearly management are desperate to pay-off the vast design bill as soon as they can get away with it
Service will no doubt bed itself in, but 20 covers at 8pm on a Friday night tells it's own story
Let's hope the BTers discover it and bail them out
Probably one of the best things to happen to TriBeCa(and the city) in a long time
The place is sure to be a big success
The Space: Big, beautiful, and very different(which is hard achieve in NYC)
It is a mixture of old world pub and posh TiBeCa loft
I really felt at home in this place
They transformed what used to be a grungy Thai restaurant into one of the most beautiful places i have been to in a long time
Light and dark woods worked well with rought iron and beautiful exposed brick
They have multiple fireplaces which will be great for the cold fall and winter nights
There were also multiple private rooms which make this a great places for private parties or large groups
The menu: Very innovative
Virtually something for everyone (I have an urge to go back because there were so many things that I wanted to try)  The Food: Absolutely Flawless
The presentation was unique and the flavoring was superb
Everything was cooked to perfection
This surprised me for a new restaurant which usually comes with some problems at first
but not here
Suggestions: Lobster Bisque, Short Ribs, Chicken and Biscuits
Food Pricing: Very Reasonable (We had a bottle of wine, apps, entrees, and deserts: for 2 people it was under $125)  Service: Incredibly friendly attentive staff
They were really on their game(they need to make sure that lasts)
Bar tender(Abel) was great, and had a lot of great cocktails and was very friendly
Wine List: Kind of limited and a tad bit pricey
Since they are so new I expect their list will expand and give people a lot more options
but don't get me wrong
what they have in their current inventory is quite good
It was just an overall wonderful addition to the neighborhood
I can't wait to go back
I LOVE Mamouns
Its cheap, fast, and good good good
Try the falafel with hummus
$2 falafel sandwich??? cant beat that!
We went last week, and it was, well, just ok
The waitstaff is nice, but is pushy and seemed irritated when we did not order an a la carte side vegetable (we already had a cheese plate, appetizers and ordered 2 entrees)
The cheese plate was nice, but the risotto appetizer was oily
The chicken and fish entrees were good as well
It's probably a fine addition to the neighborhood, but not really worth the cab ride (even from the east 60s)
While the upper east side had plenty of italian restaurants, Sfoglia stands out from the rest
The food was terrific--we had an appetizer of Italian meats which were delicious and pasta which was cooked just right
It's pretty small on the inside and we (party of 2) shared a table with another two-some
At first we thought it to be odd, but it worked with the atmosphere
Also, they don't have their liquor license running yet, so take advantage and bring your own wine ($8 cork fee)!
The trendy atmosphere threw my off at first, but wow I was pleasantly surprised when the food came
They have the basic Thai staples here and some more creative offerings
Prices are good and I am due for a visit soon
Had a business lunch at AJ Maxwells recently
I must say the food and ambience were excellent and yet another great NYC steakhouse you must check out
Up there with some of the best in the city
My favorite steakhouse in New York
This place even beats Lugers, people
Food, service, ambiance - amazing
I've eaten here 3 times already, and every experience was wonderful
I've had the ribeye, the salmon, and a burger/fries at the bar, and they were all exceptional
Plus the mac cheese!!! Oh, so good! This is a great place for a romantic meal, a group meal, or just some bar food and drinks after work
We have now been to DARNA (which just opened at Second Ave
near 34th Street in Murray Hill a few weeks ago) three different times
On every visit, the food has blown us away
We especially loved the Couscous Royale (with lamb sausage, carrots and other vegetables), which is arguably enough to serve two

Great for low budget chinese food
Large Servings
Great atmosphere
A little bit cramped so if your clostaphobic beware
There are long lines on the weekend so get ready to wait
Lots of locals
Great overall experience
Ok, after reading some of the negative reviews I had to laugh
Wo Hop isn't a place you go to when you want fine dinning
You go there when you want fast service and good New York City Chinese food
This is a place I have been too many times, usually after a night out at near by bars
The service might not be the best, but the food definitely hits the spot
I was introduced to Wohop Through Vic an avid Wo-Hop fan
My first time in Wohop was like something out of a movie
I sat a a corner table with a group of Regulars
What a good time! The staff was halarioius! And knew my friends by name, the staff catered to us
I am not a fan of chinese food usually, but even that was delicious not to mention my first encounter with chinese beer
Worth your time
I am planning a trip to NYC in couple of weeks and Wohop is On my too do list
No matter how cheap it is, it is not enough considering how bad the food is on taste, appeal, etc
Go somewhere else please!
Typical American chinese food
When there is 0 chinese in the place, that means the food is not authentic
food was O
K
service was cold-blooded Q: May I have a cup of water? A: NO! you must order first!
Don't be nervous when you walk into this simple underground establishment, the food is outstanding! There's often a short wait for a table because space is so limited, but the food gets served very fast, and the prices cannot be argued with
Everything I've had on the menu has pleased me thus far
Once you order your food, you'll look around and desire other people's orders, so take your time ordering
When in doubt, the beef chow fun is no joke!
You don't go to Wo Hop for American Chinese food, for that you don't go to Chinatown at all
I know my Chinese food! They have the BEST: salt + pepper squid, crab - Chinese style (not black bean sauce - sauteed dried, trust me all my friends love), sauteed flounder with veggies (the fish is lightly fried and melts iin your mouth)
The casseroles are good too
DO NOT order American Chinese food there
It's terrible
i'm chinese so i know chinese food
it was the worst 10 dollars i have ever paid in my ENTIRE life
the hot and sour soup was not soup it was jelly
came in chunks and cold, omg
noodle was overfried
The food here is a cheap version of American Chinese food
The food is poor
You can probably find better food at a cheap take-out restaurant
The service is terrible
The waitors never come around
They act like you're wasting their time
We had asked to pack our leftovers but the waitor completely forgot
We just left
We were glad we left
We ate upstairs after making sure I was at the right Wo Hop (15 mott st, 17 mott st = basement)
It looks like most chinese places I've been to inside
The service is a total joke, they act like your wasting their time, BUT the food is amazing! Everyone that I went with agreed that the food was the best they've ever had
The portions are HUGE and the prices are very, very reasonable!
We really enjoyed dining there and definetly worth the price! Highly recommended!
The only thing that keeps me going back to wo-hops is the shrimp w/ black bean sauce
Everything else is average- bad
Don't even think about ordering the wonton soup or the half frozen eggrolls
The waitstaff is patronizing, annoying, and unfriendly
The only thing worse than the smell of garbage outside the place is having to look at the 8x10s of the losers on the wall who think they're celebrities
Great shrimp though, lol
I've in NY every other week on business
I go to Wo Hop each time I'm here
Every time I go, I have tried different things on the menu and haven't found anything I don't care for yet
Highly recommend the fried dumplings! Garlic eggplant is awesome too
I've been going to Wo Hop for over 22 years
All choices are great, although I rarely stray from my Egg Drop Soup, Fried Dumplings and Beef w/Black Bean Sauce
Not a romantic place to bring the wife, girlfriend or business colleague but if you want to impress as far as food, this is no better than this Asian delight
Bigggest reccomendation: EAT AT THE DOWNSTAIRS PORTION OF THE RESTAURANT
The foo dis MUCH better
Wo-Hop started out as a restaurant over 60 years ago, and it has turned into a cult
The waitstaff has more personality than half of New York City
Anyone who doubts that Wo-Hop is the greatest establishment of all time has no idea what they are talking about
Order the roast pork w/black bean sauce, and Young Chow Fried Rice (white, Chinese style), and you will be Wo-Hop for life
It's also a little-known fact that Wo-Hop will cook American-style omlettes
There eggs are better than any diner eggs I've ever had
The fried dumplings are incredible as well
Every night at precisely 11pm, you will see Elf-Hop (a
k
a
Mr
Bong)
Ask for Elf-Hop, he alone is worth the price of admission
I am proud to be a supporter of Wo-Hop

When you go to Chinatown, don't expect white glove treatment
These are neighborhood restaurants that are meant to provide great meals as inexpensively as possible
Wo Hop does that
till all hours of the night! After a club closes and you want something other than a diner, take a ride to Wo Hop
They will be open and the food will be great! ENJOY!!!
just ask bobby and linda- turned them on many years ago and now they go without me
best dumplings- ribs and black bean sauce you'll ever eat
price is great
was there last saturday 6 people ate until we were full for 50
00
awesome food
its worth the wait - have patience when you go
all the food has that authentic chinese flavor
dont forget about the crispy noodles - yum yum
if you haven't tried the salted fish fried rice
u gotta

Just average
How hard is it to make a salad? It was bagged lettuce, chicken, they forgot the ham, and forgot the apples! I don't know what all the hype is about? The space is very attractive, but not worth waiting to get into
A friend and I were finally able to get a reservation after several tries
I'm confused as to what the buzz is all about
It tooks 3 drink orders to get one in a glass that didn't have a chipped rim, the food was no better than average and the space was way too loud
Maybe I'll try again when it isn't quite a hot spot
Cookshop is definitely worth a visit
The drink list was fun and yummy
The bread plate is served with a tasty little mystery pate
An appetizer of red beet salad was generously portioned
My entree of scallops was satisfactory - I questioned the blend of flavors and admittedly was jealous of my friend's gorgeous sturgeon
We also shared a side (a LARGE side!) of beet greens which were absolutely delicious
I found my dinner to be a bit on the heavy side and blamed the large portions
Most everything on the menu looked delicious - an eclectic blend of ingredients
The service was average
I'm looking forward to a second visit!
This is one of my new favorites in the city
The service was very attentive, we were seated promptly on a saturday, and the food is great
I love their porgy
The portions are big, but make sure to save space for their yummy deserts
Great vibe, friendly staff, amazing food
this place is truly a winner
I will definitely be back soon
I finally made it after recommending Cookshop to 2 people
They raved about it
My friend and I, on the otherhand, were disappointed
It's pleasant on the inside, I liked the bar
The food wasn't terrible, but after reading the reviews I was really looking forward to it
For appetizers, we had the shrimp w/ salad, the beet salad and the deviled eggs
I did like the eggs
The others were mediocre
For dinner we split the steak
It was just good, the onion rings were pretty decent but the steak was just good
We got the spiced fries
I was nauseated by the obscene size of the bowl
Our waiter was on the moon, the bus boys were attentive
I would however, give it one more try
I do hope they get their act together by then
Please!
Another addition to the new restaurant row on Tenth Avenue, Cookshop delivers fresh and organic ingredients with the talented cooking of an experienced chef
The chef/owners of Five Points restaurant hit the bull's-eye with new Cookshop
Intelligently designed and decorated restaurant gives you an airy and open feeling
Food is better than your average organic restaurant and you actually feel good about eating it
Servers were helpful but also left you to enjoy your meal without rushing
Extensive wine collection complements the menu items
Delicious dessert is the final touch of the evening
I will definitely add this new spot to our regular dining locations
I would recommend making reservation specially for the weekend
I have eaten at Cookshop twice
It's a shame that the service is sub-par, because the food is great
My party was there for 3 hours
That said, I made sure to pay before we had coffee, so that the server was not waiting on us to pay; and I left a 30% tip, knowing we'd be there for a while
We were not once offered a refill on coffee
When I accidentally knocked over a glass of water, not only did nobody come over to help clean it up, or even offer a napkin, the staff just gave us nasty glares
Clearly, we were embarassed, and I cleaned up the whole thing
I don't think I'll ever go back to Cookshop, in spite of the great food
Shame on you!
Atkins lovers rejoice, finally an upscale retaurant that appeases to the high end palate
The menu reads like a comfort food version of a Wild Kingdom American hunting episode
Throwing meat on top of grits for a premium is not impressive
Decor is missing some good taxidermy
Not for the faint of heart vegans
An amazing place, in every aspect -- design, service, food, value
5 star experience for 3 times less, which is also a good thing
One of the best dining adventures I have ever had, and that's alot of dining adventures for me over the years I've visited the Big Apple
A great place, don't miss this
Eat here often!
The food is great! Must get the apple martini
it is wonderful! The service was great and our waiter was very knowledgable about the entire menu
Great new place in the neighborhood
WOW! What a great restaurant
Food, decor and service all top notch
Try the rotisserie chicken and the fresh shrimp
All desserts area fantastic
Can't wait for a second visit
After waiting 45 minutes past my reservation time, my party of 2 was seated in the middle of this pretenious establishment (get over youselves!) Pretty: yes
Conducive to conversation: no
The food was good, but it wasn't outstanding
and the service was not to be desired
Our server didn't even make the attempt to be knowledgeable about the menu, and I guess his priorities were to other tables, even though we shelled out the cash for drinks at the bar, a bottle of wine, appetizers, and 2 pricey entrees
Once was enough for me
What a welcome addition! I'm a longtime fan of Five Points, and was delighted to see have another Marc Meyer option downtown
The concept is different enough to note be Five Points West (mix of homey and high energy, perhaps influenced by seeing traffic zoom up 10th Ave), while Meyer's principles stay intact -- fresh ingredients, constantly changing menu, specials that render said menu almost unnecssary, nice wine and cocktail selection, a well-designed space, and very good service
We sampled the whole porgy, cod, duck livers, and a vegetable frito misto, and were very happy all around
We skipped dessert, since we were well fed and had a birthday party to go to
This was after the restaurant had only been open a couple of weeks -- it came across much more established -- a feat in itself
We just made our next reservation
Modern in design with an interesting ceiling
The food is superb
Order the fries while your waiting for your app's
Each main course is excellent
Deserts average
They want to please
I awaited the opening of Cookshop (being a huge fan of Five Points) and was not dissapointed
I had a delicious appetizer of chicken fried duck livers that melted in my mouth, an entree of perfectly tender short ribs
My husband had fresh oysters to start, which he devoured, caviar deviled eggs, and the baked pasta
I had a few bites of the pasta and thought the noodles were tasty
The atmosphere was warm, romantic, and sophisticated, without any pretension
I will return
Went to Cookshop last night and thought it was fantastic

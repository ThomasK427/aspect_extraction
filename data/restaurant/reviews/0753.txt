SO YUM!! the place looks so cool and funky
great bowls and plasticware and i agree, it's a shame to see everyboyd just trash these high quality thick bowls and spoons
i save all of mine and reuse them, but itd be nice if they took in used bowls to reuse
price is pretty high, but a solo serving easily feeds two ppl
Special dessert (rice ice-cream?), special interior decoration (modern art?), a must-go place even you are not interested in dessert
this place is great! you can sample all the rice puddings and add any topping they have! the containers are great too because even the solo serving is almost too big for one person
the place is also designed really cool and super well lit - it's like a beacon on the dark street that it's on!
NYC amazes me with its novelties, and here is another! A place that serves nothing but delicious, flavorful rice pudding
The staff isn't overly friendly, but they are far from the worst I've encountered
You can try the flavors before you make a choice
And yes, it is $6 for pudding, but the solo's are big enough to share, and besides
there aren't many places in NY where you can have such good (unique) desserts for this price! Also, if you aren't fortunate to grab a seat, there's a park across the street
Yummm
But I understand not for evryone
If you like rice pudding this place will be a noteable surprise! It was rich and filling
I had the cheesecake and my husband had the peanutbutter
It was great
The only thing I hate is I live sooooooooooo farrrrrrrrrrr awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Thats okay they ship
you'll love it here, its almost like a futuristic bar
its a groovy space and they have a bunch of rice pudding
i keep bringing more and more friends here and they all like it!! ps - you are allowed to sample the flavors before you choose one! and the servings are HUGE
this will definately fix your rice pudding fix
Dont worry about your diet! For sure this kind of dessert are UPPP with the calories
You deserve it to have it sometimes
I tried coast to coast cheesecake and the one with hazelnut - it is sooooo good!!! I notice when guys serve they are more friendly than the gals
Ladies has no patience serving customers
very unique dessert joint
we were walking on our way home from dinner and walked in for a taste test
service was acommodating, fun flavers, pudding lighter than ice cream, and never realized i'd actually think of holding onto tupperware
scene was mod but not passe, felt like we were suddenly in HK or Tokyo
too hip for NYC
hope it doesn't become as trendy as panini's
small bowls enough to serve one or two are $5
large bowls for a family of four to six are $20
it is expensive but worth the occasional splurge
they also give out lots of samples
the pudding comes in the most darling tupperware containers
All the flavors are pretty good, it is just a metter of personal perference
One problem is that there are only four tables for people to sit at
Stop at Lombardi's across the street for a killer pizza dinner beforehand!
I've been here twice so far and I love it! Their rice pudding is very rich (in taste AND price), but SO good---the free samples are definitely a plus! Unfortunately, a lot of the high cost is probably going to those huge plastic containers---they should have some system like the coffee places, where people can bring back their containers for refills at a reduced cost
If not, they make good tupperware containers anyway
I'm totally into the space-age vibe of this place, but I wish they had more tables to sit down at
I can't wait until Rice To Riches becomes a franchise---lucky for my waistline and my wallet, however, there's still only one
PS---CozyShack IS great, and way more affordable, but Rice To Riches is definitely a fun and yummy splurge
This is one of those places you just have to try once
The only thing they sell here is rice pudding and it seems like they're actually making money off of it! I got their maple syrup and blueberries flavor which was delicious
I don't think I would ever go again, but it was nice to try it once
TIP: The single serving actually could serve two if you're going for dessert
It was good, but none of the flavors WOW
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone, but they were out of it that day
It just sounded good
It's a cool little cafe where the pudding is overpriced
The staff should be a bit more friendly
(HINT: hire Starbucks employees who are tired of coffee)
While the mango version was tasty -- they still didn't have a plain ol', just like mom makes it rice pudding
Plus at $5
00 for a single serving, I'll stick with cozy shack, thanks
A homier atmosphere, and cheaper prices would've made me a regular
This is a fun spot to visit, great look, and very tasty treats! I've been a few times already and will continue to go back
This is a great place
Who would have thought that someone could open a restaurant serving nothing but rice pudding? If you're a fan of rice pudding, though, you definitely need to take a trip to this place
Some of the flavors are a bit too baroque -- the green tea rice pudding would have been a lot better with no cherries in it, and who really needs chocolate mint rice pudding? -- but the simpler flavors are irrestisable and excellent (e
g
, vanilla, cinnamon, and even lemon)
The decor is also great, and the flat-screen monitor menus, featuring tumbling rice grains and flying dishes, among other things, will keep you entertained even if the food doesn't
One big criticism: the packaging is incredibly wasteful
They serve the pudding in hard plastic bowls, very similar to tupperware, which the patrons simply throw away when they're done
They really should be washing these things and recylcing them
Rice to Riches is a perfect place for rice pudding lovers like myself
There are so many flavors to choose from, but do not stress out! You can sample before you spend $4
50+ tax
It's a lot for rice pudding, but it is good
Rice to Riches has winningly merged comfort food and Jetsons-style decor
When you select your choice of pudding, you'll get a yummy dessert or snack
I just finished the East Indian, with coconut milk, cardamon and golden raisins
It was great
The portions are not too small for the price
I think those making that complaint are, frankly, just too poor to eat there
And, while there's no shame in that, that's hardly RtR's fault
It's a luxury food shop, people
It's got its own designer water, for goodness' sake! You can tell by looking at the outside that the food will be pricey
Plus, they hand out a lot of samples; that adds up
So, I don't think there's reason to kvetch about price
Rice to Riches' pudding is not something you need, it's something you pamper yourself with
It should be appreciated with that in mind
Delicious rice pudding, reasonably priced, and served in a way that will leave you using the word cool more times than you probably mean to
I didn't count, but there seemed to be ten or fifteen varieties of rice pudding, two of which were daily specials
I had the Endangered Maple , which came with dried blueberries
The best rice pudding I've had in that price range, hands down ( Gabriel's is the only competition, but you'll have to hack your way through an expensive dinner to get there, and it's a little more expensive)
Vanilla was scrumptious, Chocolate Cherry was nothing special, and Pineapple left me confused as I asked my friend Ben, who ordered it, Did you taste that before you ordered it?!   Worth the trip, in my opinion, from anywhere south of 42nd street
It's open late, too
After walking past this place for about a year, it has finally opened and pleasantly surprised
Although I was a bit overwhelmed at first, what with all the space-aged futuristic decor and plethora of plasma flat-screen monitors, once it got to puddin' time, it was all smooth sailing
I HIGHLY recommend a half and half of Vanilla and Banana (with toasted coconut)
Other interesting flavors (I had a bunch of free samples) were the Maple with Blueberries and Cinnamon
Enjoy!
To all the nay sayers out there, all they need to do is take one taste and they will see what a mistake it was to take this concept lightly! BRAVO!!!! Every flavor is better than the next, I am already addicted
What an original idea! A place with about 20 different flavors of rice pudding

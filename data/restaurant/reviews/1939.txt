the rhubarb ruined my pie (i never had rhubarb before)
next time, sans rhubarb
who cares if celebs are there or not
the biscuits rock
I LOVE Bubbys! Everytime I go there I have great food, fast service and an A-List celebrity sighting
The best of which was a few weeks ago when Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez were eating brunch just a few tables away
Only downside is a long wait on the weekends
Kitchy waitstaff make it fun
I don't know what all the hype is with this restaurant! The food was teeerrribbllle!!! It was so bland and it took so long for our orders to arrive
Service was bad also since they were understaffed
If I were you, I wouldn't dare to try this restaurant! The prices were kinda expensive too! There are alot more better restaurants in the area!
Apple Pie ala mode
If you are only hungry enough for one course
go straight for dessert
Bubby's biscuits make it worth a wait on weekends for their excellent brunch selections
For lunch and dinner, Bubby's transforms it's downhome breakfast specialty to downhome BBQ
Best barbecue in Manhattan and best side dishes anywhere!
So tasty
So filling
VERY lean, HUGE burger, and when you tell them you want it well-done, they cook it just the way you requested witout drying it out
absolute best burger in town
Bubby's is a great place to have dinner/lunch/brunch with a group or just two people
The food is homestyle and good
Great service and reasonable prices
Don't forget to have some pie!
This is all you need to eat on Sunday
Massive and delicious servings
Leisurely and like home
Don't trust the glowing reviews from the regulars - I had one of the worst meals of my life there
Mac cheese is nothing to write home about; the beet salad is boring, mostly lettuce; tuna sandwhich - boring, mostly mayo; the french fries looked re-fried and were cold; the excellent pork sandwich came on one of those supermarket hot-dog buns
The service was fine, but if you're actually looking for good food, stay away
It hurts to read some of these negative reviews knowing that Bubby's is my home away from home
My friendly bartender slaps a can of PBR in front of me even before i sit down! That's Pabst Blue Ribbon to you classy folks
I'm not a very stylish person, so I am suprised to hear people think of Bubby's as hip and/or trendy
How funny! I've always thought of the place as family
Oh, and the new menu where you can pick two sides for your entree creating innumerable combinations
brilliant! That means I can get mac cheese with a side of mac cheese and more Mac Cheese
that is, if I can resist the fries! And this is coming from a vegetarian
when my man and I finish dinner, everyone is satisfied!
Bubby's consistently turns out good food: the breakfast is excellent with lots of great choices; their pies are the best in the city, maybe in the country; they make their own ice cream (the buttermilk ice cream is delicious)
And on advice, I peeked into the kitchen after a busy brunch: it was a but messy with papers, but it looked good to me
I'm a Tribeca native so I've found myself stumbling into Bubby's for brunch on Sundays a handful of times
I really don't see what all the hype is about
Perhaps it's because it is the only place in Tribeca to get a quick, cheap, meal but still feel like your part of the cool crowd because, hey, it's Bubbys
Well, the food is bland and boring
Sandwiches are awful, ie
tuna, chicken, burgers
My advice- check out Five Points
It's the best brunch in New York, I've been going forever
They're consistent- the food, service and ambience make the quintessential brunch, and they're inexpensive
(The lighting is also very condusive to Sunday am hangovers!) One more last bit of advice, if you're still going to try out Bubby's, request to sit near the kitchen
One peek of what's behind those doors will keep you from going back ever again
Scary
In my opinion (perhaps I'm partial because I've been going there for about 5 years) it is the best casual restaurant in Tribeca
The perfect restaurant for kids and adults alike, even at the busiest times the food is always superb
the food was about the same as any other restaurant in little italy in NY, but the service was not as good
service was less then expected and it was more of a nuisance
they kept trying to clear our table and give us the bill when it was half an hour before closing
I drove in from Toronto, Canada with a couple of friends and we decided to explore Little Italy and have dinner
The menu and the pleasant atmosphere at Taormina grabbed our attention
The food was delicious, the service was incredible, and the waiters were very friendly
Unfortunately, I forgot my wallet in the restaurant
the next day, already almost back in Toronto, I received a phone call letting me know that it was in the restaurant
My friends from New York picked it up the next day - everything was still there, including the money
The kind people at Taormina went to the trouble to contact me, even to make long distance phone calls
I am very grateful
So if you are looking to have great food and be around good and honest people, Taormina is the place to be! Thank you
we have been there every time we go to Little Italy - by far the best place on Mulberry St - the waiters are pleasant and the host is very gracious - great food, great drink, and great experience - can't wait for a return visit -busy place-not romantic because of its popularity - make reservations
For the second year in a row Bike New York brought us to the city - it was really just an excuse to eat here
Due to poor planning and extreme hunger, we ate dinner here Saturday before the ride and Sunday after the ride
Both times only reinforced why we keep opening Taormina's door
The only knock against them came Saturady night, when our waiter occassionally forgot to listen to us
I can vouch for the pasta and the stuffed artichoke
Both are excellent
According to several of the people with me, the filet mignon is fantastic
I'll go there again
Maybe I'll try another of the many excellent restaraunts, but it's hard to ignore a sure thing
I went there on a Sunday [05
02
03] at about 5
45pm, beautiful weather
Little Italy was packed as usual, and Taormina's suck out in my date's sights; and she choose that
The ambiance and decor was beatiful
The waiters were friendly and amicable
The only negative was when i asked for grated cheese, they brought out the little dish and I had to persuade him to leave the dish so we can serve ourselves when we wished to use it
otherwise food was delicious, and no complaints
also, the main dish was 15-20 dollars, 55 dollars for 2 people [including appetizers and excluding dessert]
very reasonable!
We had dinner Sunday night (April 18, 04)
Our meal was interrupted several times by the arguments between our waiter and the maitre 'd
The salad, appetizer and main course were served within 5 minutes
Returning the main course (pasta) to the kitchen must have had it go into an oven (15 minutes?) as the plates came back very hot, the main course was over cooked: mushy-pasta
No one ever asked if the food was acceptable
To get attention and get the check, we had to put our coats on, go to the bar and ask
The maitre d was apologetic, but had been busy either arguing with the waiters or tending bar for the absented bar-tender
Not our usual experience, but our last one at this place
I have been eating at Taormina's for years
The service and food are wonderful
It's a great place to get together for great food and an even better atmosphere! I have enjoyed gathering with family each year to spend time in a place that offers a variety of different meals along with waiters with tons of charisma
Recently 7 friends and I went to Taormina's restaurant

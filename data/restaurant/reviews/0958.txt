Bad finish
Enough to make me never go back
A shame because the food was decent - and it's a block away from my house
The tapas menu is quite funky
Given that I am literate in English, I can't understand half the menu (wish they would have explanations on the side)
The food is top-notch, only sometimes a little too oily for someone like me who is super health-conscious
It has very good variety of dishes that are special, like quail eggs, squab, duck tongue (wow)
All in all, a restaurant with very unique offerings and good quality
It's usually crowded
I am glad I went during the Republican Convention - yup, no wait that evening!
This place is awesome
The flavors are amazing
I cannot stress this enough
I have been a good number of times with friends, on dates and with my family
I have tasted literally everything and have not once been dissappointed (except with one dessert!)
The plates are so perfectly sized
just big enough to share and just small enough to keep you hopping back and forth between plates without getting too full or too bored
The wines list is a perfect sweep of Spanish wines, all wonderful and complementative of the menu
The place is tiny, with rusic wooden tables and wines adorning the walls
Conversations often floursh btwn tables just adding to te occassion
Or you can sit at the bar which looks onto an open kitchen as do whenever I have the chane
I reccommend this place over and over to visiting friends and clients alike
If you are expecting big portions, go find a Cheesecake Factory
While I may be a big portions guy myself, I was extremely happy with the food and wine selection
The food was not across the board fabulous, but was on the whole exceptional enough to overcome any deficiences in one or two of the selections
I loved the wine list and was blown away with the affordable prices! This was a romatic spot that would be great for a date at any stage in the relationship
The downside was the small space and spotty service, but this is Manhattan! Reservations highly recommended
Anyone who reviewed this place and called it overpriced tapas should know that the menu is not in fact tapas! It's authentic Spanish from the Catalunya region (where Barcalona is located), with dishes appetizer-sized
The food is amazingly tasty and definately worth the money ($7-$15 per dish) and the wine list is to-die-for
The atmosphere is fun and hip and I've never experienced less than excellent service, from either the hosts or the waitstaff
This gem is not to be missed!
casa mono is a cute place but the service is atrocious and the food is soso
we arrived at around 11pm friday night, there were two open tables available and the hostess said she would call in 20 min to let us know
after sitting next door for 15 min, we saw two passerbys walk in and get a table immediately! we had to take a seat at the crowded bar in order to wait for the cramped corner table where the waiter was horrible and rude, the food was not worth it and needed sauce! the only thing that was worth it was the wine (we swiped a few bottles in vindication of the bad meal) not a recommended place to go for a good meal
the deserts were horrible as well- do not get the cheesecake!
the food was mostly excellent, with only one miss, the fried anchovies, which were a little too salty
But the wild boar was absolutely divine, the bacalao fritters were delightfully light, with a wonderful orange sauce, and the quail was delicious
We had a great bottle of wine for $30, and the service was great
This is not your usual tapas bar, which in America tends to feel more like a theme restaurant than the genuine article as found in Spain
It IS pricy though, especially if you plan on drinking wine
But if you want to experience some excellent spanish food with a twist, give it a go
I had a fabulous time at this cozy eatery
From the moment we walked in, we were treated to fantastic service and even better food
The flavors of all the dishes are all over the board yet somehow remain cohesive witheachother
Even the ramps dish is spiced up to perfection with this incredible tomato sauce
The soft shell crab is gastrono,ical perfection as is the wild boar and the steak
I have never witnessed such a creative menu right down to dessert, bay leaves coated in sugary warm tempura batter which you are meant to scrape off with your teeth as you would an artichoke leaf
One of top five in the city for sure
We tried several small dishes and I would recommend the boar, sepia(large calamari) and sorbet
But the sweetbreads tasted like they used KFC batter and the presentation was quite simply disgusting
The wines we tried were quite pricey but ultimately disappointing, thus a rip off
The service and ambiance is however very charming
I recently visited Casa Mono with friends and knew the dinner was off to a bad start when we had to wait 30 minutes for our reservation
The hostess seemed apologetic but somehow thought a few glasses of wine would make up for the unnecessary wait we endured and the rip-off waiting for us when we ordered
The high prices and small portions reflect the hype of a new Battali restaurant as well as the cache that comes with having to make a reservation a week in advance only to wait to be seated
For a more satisfying dining experience, good food and good service, go to a different restaurant
all that
but for now, it's just way too much hype surrounding this dude that's floating this place's boat
the food is good -- there are parts of the menu that stand out, and parts that don't
A few words of warning: 1) be prepared for outrageous prices
you are paying for the hype of a celeb chef in a city of lemmings
2) this is MB's loose interpretation of spanish tapas
key word: loose
one recipe was lifted in its entirety from an old betty crocker spanish cookbook
3) did i mention the prices? $17 for 2 bites of steak
whatever it was
tapas should never cost $17
a word to whomever is portion controlling
the fried bay leaves are fabulous, but the paper thin excuse for crema catalan is a total tease
go to barcelona and see how they make it there
then let's talk
This was one of the most disappointing experiences I have had in quite some time
I figured that the food would make up for cramped quarters and poor service but I could not be more wrong
The calamari and goat cheese croquettes were too salty and the potatoes were not fully cooked
If that were not bad enough, the tab for this lousy food was out of line
There are many great tapas place in the city but this was not one of them
Stay away!
An interesting menu of small dishes expertly cooked and presented
Strong flavors, interesting and unusual Mediterranean combinations, not necessarily Spanish
Great food service
Promptly seated w/early reservations
Sommelier (JT?) extremely pleasant, friendly, helpful
Server attentive above par
Food DELICIOUS! Pumpkin cod croquettes rock! Light full of flavor
Cockscomb, tripe, duck egg, patatas bravas, steak - all EXCELLENT! Flavorful, seasoned cooked to perfection
Now tied as our favorite w/Lupa
Next time we'll try sitting @ the bar
-Tamara Paul
The food is exceptional - from the Setas(mushrooms) to the Fried anchovies(don't knock them unless you've tried them)
There are so many choices and because they are all small dishes you can order a bunch and share with your table
Not only is it a comfortable atmosphere, but the service was great each time I've been and always helpful in selecting out a perfect Spanish wine to complement my meal
I'd recommend making a reservation, but if you don't, you can always put your name in and wait at Bar Jamon!
The food was great, but the waitress gave us a dirty look when my friend and I only ordered one plate each (ignoring her mandate that a meal = 3-4 small dishes), and then rushed us out when we had finished eating
I suppose if you're prepared to ring up a big bill, you'll get good service
I was skeptical of this restaurant because of the hype around MB lately but pleasantly surprised
Of the nine wonderful dishes we ordered there were two that were just divine
The pumpkin and goat cheese croquettas were so light and the flavor just blossomed in the mouth
The skirt steak was another standout dish
the onion marmelade (cannot remember if that is what they called it or if I made that up but it was onion) with a hint of a unique spice in it (maybe an Indian spice?) was unique and delicious
The atmosphere was also nice and relaxed

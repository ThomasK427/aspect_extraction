Try it!
I walked passed by this little place a few times and the name Hip-Hop Chow got me very curious as to what sort of food this place have to offer
So one adventurous evening, I was with my girlfriend and she decided to push me in to give it a try
I ordered Southern Buttermilk Fried Chicken with collard greens and came with a side of very delicious mac cheese
She opted for the salmon and grilled egg-plants
We ended up fighting for the food since it was so good
The Chef even came out and asked us how the food was! He was friendly and let us try the Peach Cobbler on the house!  I highly recommend you try this place
Just want to say the food is unbelievable
Soul food with a twist is the new in
It is definitely to die for!! Not only is the food good, the chef was so nice
Will be heading there again for like the millionth time
Went there last weekend and had a great time
It' was good to see some pretty creative choices in the menu
The food was served promptly and the service at a good level
We had some chicken and the country fried steak and both were  delicious
The atmosphere seemed a little too hip but still ok
I'll go back there
This small restaurant is a great place to try the best of both soul food and chinese specialties
The staff is warm friendly (the chef even came out to chat) and the food was amazing! We got the catfish with both twists (asian and comfort food style) and both renditions were very tasty! The bok choy side and creamy mac cheese are a must!!
I stopped in with a few friends and we had a great time
Cool little original place in the E Village - perfect before a night out
Fried chicken and mac and cheese were delicious and not like I've had anywhere else
Hip Hop Chow is my spot to stop off, enjoy a great meal, throw down a bottle or two of wine with my friends, watch some awesome Kung-Fu videos, listen to some off-da-hook old-school rap and hip hop, and continue the party
I crave the amazingly delicious Country Fried steak, the mac and cheese drives me nuts, and the fried chicken melts in my mouth! If you like scallops, you gotta have the scallop salad with avocado, and if you like corn or corn chowder, wait till you try what chef Kwan puts together for you on his tasty corn chowder
I love this place, its cute, fun, unique, and unpretentious - to me, it's what I love about NYC - check it out, and enjoy!
It's hard to believe but this place actually stands out in the East Village on 2nd Ave
I get cravings for their mac and cheese and fried chicken
I've also had the ribs
They're pretty good
The service is friendly and currently, they have BYOB
Pretty good deal
i like the bar area
the bartender was nice and the cocktail list is a nice suprise for the neighborhood
when we finally sat down to eat i was hugely disappointed by the food
i got a steak special that was way overpriced ($12 more then the steak on the menu and no warning from the waitress) and it was cooked to the wrong temperature
definitely will only go back to grab a drink
every single week i go to this place for brunch, with all of the options in the neighborhood, this is the one place with amazing food and service
try the vegetarian biscuits and gravy with eggs, it wont disappoint
With such a great corner location and all the hype, one would expect at least decent if not good food
Neither is the case
The food was boring and the staff just as bland
The place is always full, why I have no idea
My advice is to go to Williamsburg for flavor and not image, stay away from all these trendy spots and try some of the other less pretensious places
Since moving to the neighbourhood I've visited Lodge on many occasions and have never been even remotely disappointed
From their fantastic brunch - $10 including a mimosa or bloody mary with the best Eggs Florentine I have ever tasted to their delicious dinner menu - polenta with seitan steak, hanger steak with mashed p's, and a moreish meatloaf - there is nothing I wouldn't recommend
Try it and you'll be hooked!
Lodge has great fish dishes and red wine! Its a good neighborhood spot
I also like that they have healthy vegan options as well for my vegan friends
Great atmosphere and great drink! My kids and I definitely enjoyed coming here
I always bring things for them to do and we love trying new places
This is definitely a place we will come back to
Although the ambience is quite cool and the location is great, I suspect the contractor is still employed as the chef
I waited over half an hour for the food, and it was cold when it came out
When they brought back the same dish hot, it was just as disgusting
The best part of the entire meal was the ketchup
Definitely NEVER eat here
Good neighborhood spot to brig a date or your mom when she's in town
Great wine list with $2
00 beer options
Don't be fooled by some of the reviews
The food at Melbas is NOT southern, NOT soul, NOT american and definitely NOT good
The service was slow and unattentive
Melba was pleasant, however she wanted to introduce the chef but we declined for obvious reasons
NOT!!
It's summertime and the living is easy
and the food delicious
at Melba's! I am from Los Angeles, CA and was sitting in my hotel room when a friend called and said, Melba's was a must
We arrived in the evening for dinner and at the door to greet us was Melba
She was delightful and the most precious host a restaurant could wish for
Then came the food
the pecan crust talapia was so amazing that i ordered one to go
My friend had the short ribs of beef and was very comfortable eating it to the bone
When in town
do as the locals
eat at Melbas
Enjoy
I was looking forward to dining at Melba's for some time
When i finally treked across the Brooklyn Bridge, on a wonderful June night, i was dissappointed, all the thrill of summer dining in the city, sucked out of my stomach
The food was horrible, horrible, horrible and the wait was forever
The Mac and cheese was the same recipe my 8 year old daughter put together for her slumber party
And oh, if you love ketchup, the buffalo wings are to die for
The only comfort i enjoyed at Melba's was the decor; a wonderful pulse in the heart of Harlem
The decor is amazing! Such a great place to eat and enjoy
The menu has a great selection - I had the tilapia and it was to die for
Melba is a great woman, too
We chatted with her and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful
I'm excited to go back for more
This is the way dining in Harlem should be! Been going there since the start and never a disappointment
I take clients there from London and Paris and they always want to come back for more
The bar is excellent, the food is divine and the look is very Soho comes to Harlem
With Melba always there to greet guests at the front door it makes you feel like you have stepped back in time when a restuarant owner always knew your name and your favorite cocktail
Be sure to call ahead though
Melba takes lots of private parties so you would hate to be turned away at the door
If you're going with a group- expect to wait! Our Sunday reservation was at 1:45pm; we didn't get our food until almost 1 hour later and were sorely disappointed that the food was just average
The service was awful - our server brought us water at the very end of the meal! Why come here when there are much better places to get the same type of food!
I've been wanting to try Melba's for awhile but my first visit was disappointing
We called to make a reservation only to be told they didn't take reservations
When we arrived we were asked if we had a reservation and were told we'd have to wait 35- 45 mins for a table
After the long wait, the food was just ok
I sent back the turkey meatloaf beacuase it was just plain bad tasting

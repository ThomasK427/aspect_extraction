Our average experience plumetted to an utter lack of desire to ever return
The service and food have become so poor in quality that after paying for the check yesterday, my boyfriend and I vowed never to eat at Felix again
Our waiter never came to ask how our food was
he never showed up again after taking our order, for that matter
The prices have gone up and some of good old standby entrees have disappeared from the menu
I will be sure to tell my friends not to visit as well
The food is ok, ive had much better
After sitting through an entire meal with some of the rudest servers, the waitress first gave us someone elses bill-with someone else's credit card, then when we got our bill they had over charged us by over $50
The waiter was very rude and condescending when we pointed out the mistake, as if we couldnt add
Then when we asked for directions as we were leaving he accused us of leaving without paying, when the bill was on the table the whole time! Would never go back or recommend to someone who wasnt my enemy!
I have been to this restaurant alot times and enjoy it thoroughly
I love the mussels, goat cheese salad, cotes de provence wine, escargot, etc
However, I had an unpleasant experience the most recent time that I ate here: our party was placed next to a table of guys who were not eating but were standing and drinking (in the middle of the restaurant and not by the EMPTY bar area) and were bumping into our table and chairs
My party felt as if we were eating in the middle of a bar
The remainder of the restaurant was a quiet charming ambiance (including the EMPTY bar area) with the exception of our area
It was absolutely horrible
We requested that this group of men be moved to the bar area and were told that this is not possible because they are good customers
Therefore, the service is not accomodating
I went here last night with my book group and I must say that the service was pretty bad
The waiter didn't know the menu, didn't bring more than one item at a time, and put some orders in twice with the kitchen
We had to ask for water about 4 times before it finally came - which is ridiculous
Ironically though, our food came within about 10 minutes of placing our order in
The food was pretty basic - probably not worth the price
The decor is attractive, though the tables are dirty
Only go if you have a lot of time to waste - might be good if you go on a hot date where you don't notice the rest of the world around you
Otherwise, I say don't bother
Absolutely Fabulous! If you're craving a Croque Monsieur, c'est la, mes amis! Great place to stop for lunch while shopping in Soho
Amazing frites, great poulet, Loved the Croque Madame, even the O
J
and the bottled mineral water was fabulous
Scene is great, esp
when it's warm and the windows are open
You must try!
Food is always good, service tends to go either way, but nothing lets you pretend you're in Paris like a semi-outside table in late summer
My best friend and I sat there for hours drinking wine and talking
A great place to people watch when the weather is nice
Great place but bad service !!! I went there for lunch one year ago and the waiter was excellent (where did he go ???) this time the waiter jeremyas he said was so superficial
didn't care about us and have so much attitude
this guy should work in a dinner ,didn't even know the menu ,he couldn't explain me anythings ,a real nightmare
But they have a good food,thanks to the chef
Food is decent, it is not too expensive
The server ignored us the whole time
He was hanging out in the bar with other waiters
We asked other waiters for our check with no success
The bus boy finally brought us the check!!!
Though they do have good food and the location is great, the service is the worst I have ever experienced
We recently had the most arrogant, indifferent server I've ever seen, who waited 30 minutes to take our order and had to be called over for every little thing
the coffee took 20 minutes to arrive, and the bill was never picked up
I finally had to walk up and hand the bill to the hostess, and then with great glee wrote a big fat 0 on the tip line
On the way out, the hostess wished us a good evening, and I politely told her that our service was terrible
Her reaction? She scrunched up her nose, held up her hands and shrugged me off
I have been her many times but will never return
Don't waste your money
I went to Giginos for the first time last week and I promise I will be a regular
I was greeted by a full staff and even the manager took the time to introduce himself and seat us, and what a gentleman
The waitstaff was very attentive
I felt like I had 3 people assigned to my table
What a difference from the traditional italian joint
The food was creative and well prepared
Also a great wine list to compliment the fantastic cooking
This was the first time I left a place in the city and was fully satisfied!!!!
Food
mmmmmmmm
delicious
I went to Italy last summer and I have to say that I walked into this place and I felt like I was back
The food was unbelievable and really brought me back to the countryside
The cavatelli was to die for and so was the pizza
The only thing that wasnt italian was the service
but thank God because the service in Italy was terrible
Our waiter was attentive and knowledgable of the food and there always looked like there was either a manager or owner surveying the dining area at all times
Definately a place where I will come back to with friends and family
Excellent food every time we go, my only reservation is that it is quite pricey
Still, it's always delicious
Gigino's is fantastic
The food is of an exceptional quality
It has been downtown for quite sometime but somehow it remains fresh and inventive
The decor is warm and the service is quick
Sometimes you may encounter a new waiter and the warmth may not be fully adequate but it is still by far my favorite restaurant in Tribeca
Great for groups looking to have a good time
You have to try the restaurant made mozzarella
Been to this place a few times, it's close to where I work
The ambience and the service have always been good
The last time I went there I had the grilled veal chop - it was very well done
Very delicious
However, these guys can really use some major improvements for their pasta dishes, especially at the price they are charging
I've had $7 pasta dishes better than those I've had here
Every time I've eaten here the food, wine, service, and ambience has been fantastic
We usually ask for a table in the back under the skylights or on the sidewalk
Aside from slightly high prices, I have no real complaints
This is a great escape if you're tired of the less-than-ideal italian fare offered below Houston
I went there with a group of 5 other people
We were looking for Italian and inexpensive
The food was good and the menu had a variety of Italian dishes
From the looks of the menu, the bill wouldn't be all that bad, but I guess it was the number of dishes
In the end, I didn't feel that it was worth it for a little above average italian
Nice place, good for your sub-urban relatives and other visitors threatened by hip food
The service is swift, the portions are large and the location is great
went here for a group dinner (5 people) with high expectations
i had heard the food was great and wanted to support downtown
the food WAS excellent, but the service (even though it wasn't a busy night) was horrible

The place was very busy but we were seated immediately
The service was mostly excellent and very attentive
The dcor was nothing special, but the side alcoves are great
The portions were very small
The food was very good
I had two tastes: the scallops and the beef tenderloin
The scallops were outstanding, though it was likely one scallops cut into three pieces
There wasn't a lot of food there
The beef was very good as well, though my companion, who also got the tenderloin, got a much fattier cut and did not enjoy it as much
The complimentary pre-appetizers were very interesting
The mixed berry plate was probably the best I've had in the city (strawberries, 2 kinds of raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, gooseberries, 2 kinds of currant, cherries)
The marshmallows were not especially great
I left very satisfied
After having been to many of the top restaurants in NYC and Europe, I can honestly say Jean Georges restaurant is nothing short of spectacular
We went with the 7 tasting course menu and every single item was fantastic! The service was absolutely impeccable, no detail was spared
The dessert was phenomenal as well (chocolate theme is the best) This place is most definitely worth every penny! If you are a foodie and can spend the time and money, you will not be disappointed
This is the best one I ever been for dinner
been to all the best ones in Paris(almost) and many in NYC
So far, I think this is the best
Amazing service
Great food
but the ambience is just okay
but it is alright because I go there for food and service
As someone said somewhere in this review section
Vong is great JG restaurant, too
I love the food there
However, keep in mind that not every single JG restaurant is great
But this one is just supurb!! very close to perfection
I can't wait to go back there
For my peers, it is getting tougher and tougher to be pleased by any restaurant
Jean Georges is simply one of the best
Service was excellent
Our group decided to do the regular and tasting meau together
Presentation was wonderful
I especially love the ravioli
As for the desserts, the chocolate theme is the best among all
The Merlot was great despite the low price
When you take a reservation a month in advance for a big occasion and then you can't even seat the customer at all, you won't be getting their repeat business
But then you probably don't need their business at all
We arrived at 7:45PM for an 8PM reservation made a month in advance for my wife's 40th birthday
At 9:45 we were still waiting at the bar beside a couple of chain smokers
We left and went uptown to Alouette, who treated us much better
Jean Georges has enough rich and famous customers that they don't need your money
Avoid this place unless you are one or go to Alain Ducasse where you are sure to be seated
Learn from my mistake
Don't leave a big occasion to the caprice of a place like this
I'll admit I'm not tolerant of much when it comes to restaurants of this caliber and price
On balance the food was good, but far from flawless
The frog legs were dry and not helped by the garlic broth
The scallops were a little overdone and becoming rubbery
These are minor criticisms
What really stood out was the extent to which almost all the wine pairings just did not show off any of the food
I doubt anyone tasted the pairings because some of them really clashed
We were also so put off by the captain chastising one of the servers within earshot of the entire dining room that we confronted him
He tried to make up for it with a complimentary eau d' vie (which we accepted), but it just wasn't necessary and quite the mood killer
I'll stick with Daniel
I felt compelled to write about my experience after reading some of the not so flattering reviews
While it is possible for people to have occasionally a bad experience in any restaurant, Jean Georges is unquestionably the best NYC restaurant when it comes to contemporary french cuisine
I have dined at JG many times for dinner and lunch over the past two years and both the food and the service is by far the best compared to others in NYC or else where
I have had the opportunity to dine in some of the best french restaurants around the world
but when it comes to contemporary french this is as good as it gets
The only negative is that the price value quotient makes it difficult to visit them frequently
If you are looking for a place to go for a special occasion this is the place to go
There are many famous New York restaurants that are totally overrated, which make foreign visitors say, Americans dont know anything about food
But this place is REAL
It represents the best of New York
(Okay, he is French, but is a New Yorker, you know
) Whats impressive about this restaurant is more than food, wine and serviceeverything at Jean Georges has a slight edge and precisely controlled: flower arrangements, background music (played in perfect volume), design of servers uniforms, plates, silverwareJean Georges is a true master of his trade
The only negative thing I could ever find is the huge neon ad across the Columbus Circle beams at you if your seat faces that side of the window
which, I guess, M
Vongerichten has no control over
Jean-Georges didn't disappoint
We had the seven-course Chef's tasting menu
The first taste was an amuse-geule of squash soup, which was stunning, and the meal pretty-much kept the pace
The finale was a squab with a slighly curried flavor, beautifully rare and absolutely superb
Sad to say I can't remember all of the dishes, but highlights included a garlic soup with frogs legs, a caviar dish, and turbot in a strange but probably delicious wine sauce
Desserts nice but not able to hold their own against the excellent savories
Service was generally good, but was occasionally poorly timed (our waiter offered a glass of red to go with the squab, but only after the dish arrived)
This was on a par with other top-tier restaurants--Le Manoir aux Quat' Saison and Aquavit
Was it the best? I guess I need to revisit to double-check
Possibly one of the most flavorful meals we have ever had! The use of spices, creamy sauces, airy foams, etc
was amazing
Highly recommend the tasting menu (we had the seasonal one)
SUGGESTION - two half bottles of wine was perfect for two people the seven courses
They were also very reasonably priced
Sometimes its just nice to dress up and go to a fancy restaurant, sit in a beautiful room, have good service, excellent food, and really enjoy one of the culinary jems of our city!
This is the WORST French restaurant that I have been to, and I've been to many
The lobster is drowning in vinegar, and you can barely taste anything but the sourness; who knows if it was even fresh
The appetizers and desserts are mediocre at best and there are hardly any bottles of wine for under around $70
Oh, and the bathrooms are tiny, so expect a wait, and the decor is cold and dull
For these prices, I felt cheated and would never return
Everything was very nice even with it being the Sunday of an early severe snow storm
We were seated in the smaller of the 2 dining areas
Would have liked to be in the larger dinning area but I'm not even sure it was open
We arrived half an hour early concerned about travel time and were seated promply
The staff had great timing in taking care of us and observed waiters slowing some assitants so the wine stewart had time with the patrons
The food had wonderful flavors and was perfectly prepared
I followed any suggestations that our waiter had and he didn't lead me as astray
From its reputation and high prices, I naturally had high expectation of the restaurant Jean Georges
I have to say that both the food and the service were excellent in both the main dining room and the Nougatine Room

Service was awful
we didnt get our wine until after we started eating the entree!! they gave us dessert for free which was OK
We waited to be seated and then we had to wait to get our coats back from the coatcheck for 10 minutes
In New York, the restaurant business can be so confusing
Everynew restaurant wants to impress but so few actually blow your mind
Here is a typical example
The food at Fresh was creative and super delicious
For the adventurous, try the stuffed squid and the bouillabasse, the traditionalists will love the steak that comes automatically with the surf!
Went here for my birthday and the food was wonderful
the translucent scallops were unreal and the fried clams were very very tasty
The whole flounder was delicious although the bones were a bit tricky
i recomend anyone who loves fish to at least give this one a try
However, i would worn you that if anyone in your party does not like fish dont bring them here since there is not much else on the menu
The food was tasty and fresh
It took a very long time to be seated and to be served
They are overbooking the restaurant
Service could be better for the price
I dont mind waiting for a table , but other people in our party did
I would try it again in a few months
The seats not the most comfortable
Wine list was pleasant
out of all NY restarants
We had reservations for 9 pm and were seated at 11:50 pm
They kept smiling to us for 2 hours that there is an ongoing computer problem with reservations and it's taking longer today
Who cares about their computer problem when you are out on the Saturday night and want to relax and enjoy
Then when the food finally arrived, it was cold, seems that they forgot to cook it
Very overpriced, very slow and unorganized
I had a wonderful dining experience at Fresh
The food was great and the manager was friendly, knowledgeable and courteous
The Service was a not the best but I had the impression the wait staff was not very experienced
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves seafood!
Very noisy I can deal with (hey it's NY)
Slow service I can deal with (but 8:45 to 12:15 is longer than many marathon times)
Server was knowlegeable, but time span between courses was truly ridiculous
Manager should consider another career outside the service industry, perhaps one where rudeness and lack of people skills are cherished (I'm thinking prison guard)
Not my catch of the day in NY
I came to fresh expecting a great meal, and all I got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating
Our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any wine
There was a heat problem to boot, so it was about 40 degrees in the restaurant -- we had to request to uncheck our coats! The halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the meal
Overall, this would have been fine for a $20 dollar meal, but for $200+ (apps, entrees, and bottle of wine for 2), it was absolutely not worth it at all
Oh well
I went here about 3 weeks ago for my girlfriends birthday
Excellent food, lots of nice wines by the glass
Very cute, romantic, and pleasant
We were 4 and everyone had something different and it all tasted delicious
An added treat was to see Chef Mario Batalli (of Babbo, Lupa, and Esca), sitting at the bar really enjoying his meal! GO THERE NOW!!!
A very disappointing evening at Fresh
Despite a 9:30 reservation, we weren't seated until 10:30 - by a surly host who acted as if he was doing us a big favor
But we were lucky
Many other customers waited even longer
Although our waitress was pleasant and accomdating, the overpriced food was quite the opposite
My $32 Kobe tuna was cold and incredibly salty
There are many other fine seafood restaurants in NYC more deserving of your money
We have been to Fresh a couple of times and it just keeps getting better
The sea food is so fresh and creative
I mean baby squid stuffed with braised short ribs,come on who would ever think of that
Okay maybe Eric Ripert
Who ever said the service was bad didn't have Dominick as a waiter
He was everywhere we wanted him to be
The only problem with Fresh is deciding what to eat,there are just to many things to choose from
I think next time I'm going to order 4 appetizers and call it a night
Excellent seafood with so many menu choices deciding what to get was the hardest part, but still fun
very quiet, romantic
felt like I was under water
food was good
esp
the lobster
I was there with a group of people on Tuesday night
We thought the food was really good but the service was horrible
A fly landed in my friends wine and it took the waitress a while to bring back a new glass
The same friend also asked for a well-done steak and it came out rare
This happens from time to time because good chefs dont like to cook a steak to death
The problem was that they did not bring it back to her until we were all done eating
The waitress also forgot to bring my cappuccino
Very Dissapointed
I took my girlfriend to Fresh last night mainly due to an article I read in the New York Times braging about their Ipswich clams
THEY WERE SOME OF THE WORST EVER
THE AMOUNT OF SAND THEY CONTAINED CONTINUES TO HAUNT ME
CRUNCHING AND SCRATCHING W/ EVERY BITE
Also the first round of drinks appeared to be watered down, now why would they do that? And the service stunk, completely unaccommodating, completely useless and nonexistant
The deserts were pedestrian
The only bright spot is that we were able to get a table easily, but now I think I know why
Oh and the hostess was quite nice, that's all
Fresh has a wonderful relaxing atmosphere and the service is extremely attentive
However, since our server was new she was not able to recommend dishes and had no knowledge of the wine list
Shouldn't every new waitperson be familiar with the restaurant's wines? The food was delicious and the ever-changing menu is creative but Fresh's biggest downfall was that after wine, appetizers, entrees and dessert (and 500 dollars for 5 people) we were still hungry!!!
Went there Saturday night, 4 of us
Pretty restaurant
We arrived there at 8:45 for a 9:00 reservation
We were finally seated at 9:50 and that would not have happened if we had'nt seen the hostess seating another table of 4 who arrived after us
While waiting at the bar they ran out of grey goose vodlka? after our first round of drinks
Once seated, the service was sooo slow, the bus boy kept pouring regular water in our glasses which were filled with pelligrino
the food
3 out of 4 liked our dinner, my boyfriend ordered the tuna which was completely bland
The boulibase was fine
the swordfish was great and the steamed lobster was good
Over all dinner was a big disapointment and my boyfriend decided that they should rename it rotten
Overpriced, unorganized and really slow service
We would never go back
the menu was excellent

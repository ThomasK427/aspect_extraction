The sushi were great and no doubt they were made from sushi rice and not regular white rice
The presentation were so pretty that we felt bad eating them
The service there were excellent
We got what we ordered for and the wait person there were so helpful
Our water and tea were always refilled and they even gave us a birthday cake in the form of some mixed ice cream with a cute little candle on top
Me and my friends were very happy that night and we highly recommend this small but cozy restaurant to anyone looking for and good environment to eat
Four of us walked in off the street and had a wonderful experience
The waitstaff was very kind and attentive
The food was wonderful
All of us enjoyed our meals and will be back again
Was the best meal we had in NY this weekend
I have been coming here for years and never had a bad meal
The seafood and mushroom risottos are delicious
The service is always friendly and helpful
Split the lasagna as an appetizer for the table
I love this place
I only wish they had a bar area where you could wait for your table
The pull handle in the restroom is right out of the Godfather
I have only been to the one in the Village, but I'm generall in love
This is a wonderful place to go when you want a nice dinner out without a crowd
I've never had to wait for a table, the food has been consistently good, the wine selection isn't vast, but it's reasonably priced, and the service is excellent
My only real wish is that they would allow takeout and delivery
No, it may not be a 10 in comparison with every restaurant in the city, but I have always left happy, relaxed, and well-fed and I can't say that about even some of the top 10s of the city
I have been to this place several times, and I've never had a problem
The food and service are GREAT
The fish is always fresh, and the prices are very reasonable
I have been here a few times cause I have a friend in the neighborhood -have been disappointed most of the time since there are soo many better cheap Italian restaurants also in the neighborhood
at best generic
I'm trying to understand how some places are so over-rated and suspect there may be friends of the owners filling out reports
I like Pesce Pasta but there's no way it's a ten
My family refuses to go because it's cold in winter and tables are crowded together
It's fairly priced and you get a decent veal with lemon for around $14, but let's be fair
The accompanying pasta with red sauce is nothing
The antipasto (assorted cold vegetables, etc
) are nice and very cheap
But this is a good deal restaurant, well worth the money, nothing worthy of the raves I'm reading
I have been here several times and the food is always amazing, you know a place is good when there is a line outside and it is 30 degrees
I cannot wait to dine there again
Simply incredible food, period!! Save your trip to Italy for sight-seeing
No need to go farther than this unassuming eatery for Italian
If discovered; you'll be back; guaranteed!!!
Cuisine and ambience so authentic, I'll be sure to study my phrasebook before my next visit
Small but not overwhelmed
Portions that would help you forget a long day of picking grapes
This is offically my favorite restaurant in the city
It's quaint atmosphere, charming waiters, deliciously prepared entrees (not to mention the cold antipasta, which is NOT to be missed) and Brunello on their wine list make this a hidden treasure among NY's populace of Italian eateries
Plan on waiting for a table during peak hours, but standing outside the beaded entrance people watching on Bleeker street isn't the worst place to wait in the world!
Our experience here couldn't have been lovelier
We found the place by asking a passing New Yorker where we could get good Thai food in the neighborhood, and were delighted with his recommendation of Kobma Thai
The aura is casual without being the least bit dumpy
The big glass windows lend a nice airiness
The other diners seemed to be enjoying themselves in a leisurely fashion, treating it like their own living rooms
Our server was excellent, the Pad Thai was delicious, and we'll be certain to dine there again
Due to a few amusing touches about the place, we suspect that the owner has a good sense of humor
Kobma Thai just put us in a good mood
Definitely a good choice for taking visitors to the city (the prices are really reasonable) or meeting up with friends
Also excellent for a date
Mepa's sweet savory secret
This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Manhattan no holds bar
While others are beholden to Spice and Tamarind I'll take Kobma Thai anyday
You can't go wrong with Chicken Pad Se El or Ladd Na
The atmosphere is relaxed, they open the front windows in the summer for an outdoor dining feel without the inconvience of sidewalk foot traffic interupting the meal
There is also a completely closed inner room as well
The wait staff is very friendly
This is a great place to meet friends for a meal or take visiting family members
in the blackout of 2003, kobma graciously served a number of us in the stark dark of night, perfectly spiced chicken curry and i will always patronise them for their tasty food, great value and courteous service
dine by candlelight and soak up the ambience
This place is a great place for Thai food
Nothing fancy, relaxed atmosphere, and perfect pad thai
Incredible place for lunch
The wait staff can't be beat
I've only had lunch at Kobma, but the lunch special deals are excellent -- cheap, generous, and varied
There can be a slight wait, but nothing too painful
Plus, the pleasant space makes it easy to while away an extra minute or two
We order delivery from here often, and although the food is quite good, they need to work on the presentation
They apparently don't understand what over pasta means, and when my girlfriend asked for chicken bits to be added to her pasta, she got 2 chicken cutlets that she had to cut up herself
Work on your service, guys
The waitier was the nicest one I've ever had
The food was fantastic - all of it
The portions were huge
It's the type of place that gives you enough food so you have some totake home for lunch the next day
Actually, the appetizers were large enough to be main courses - perhaps a little too big for my taste
All in all, a very nice place
And the ambience was relazed and romantic - just right
The food was probably the best Italian food I've had in the Village, and I've been just about everywhere
The waiters were friendly and helpful
The decor is very pretty it has a relaxing vibe - the candles all over the place are a nice touch
The music was a little loud, but it was good music so I didn't mind
It took an hour for the food for 2 of us to arrive, and a further 15 minutes for the third person
They had clearly made some kind of mistake, but the waiter just mumbled that they had a sudden rush on, which was patently untrue - the place was half-empty
The waiters studiously avoided us during this long wait
When I eventually managed to complain, we were offered free drinks, one of which never arrived, and the other of which was the wrong drink
The pizza (which took an hour and 15 minutes to arrive) was undercooked
The pasta was extremely plain and did not match the description in the menu
The Scene This basement warren of rooms, with cherubim and flowers popping up wherever possible, underscores the restaurant's romantic motif
The clientele consists largely of couples, most of whom seem to be regulars
Rushed servers hustling to and fro, and clouds of hot steam emerging from the kitchen
The Food The frequently changing menu consists of fairly inventive Italian food in a rich vein
A polenta cake, festooned with a confetti of hard cheese and uncooked arugula, is simple and appealing; so is a creamy potato salad with capers
Caprese salad, though, suffers from flavorless mozzarella, and a salmon fillet is dry

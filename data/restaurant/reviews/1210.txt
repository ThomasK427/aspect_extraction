I asked the (very cute) bartender what's in the sangria and he quickly said it was a family secret
I don't know what's in it, but I know I'm addicted
Rosa Mexicano
who?!!
A group of us went to Besito to celebrate a birthday - and it was a terrific choice
The food was delicious - especially the meat dishes (and the prices were very reasonable)
And the sangria - both red and white - was some of the best we'd ever had
The space looks very downtown - and they are able to accomodate larger parties quite comfortably
I can't wait for our next night there!
The decor is warm and welcoming, inspired by Mexican themes and rich with romantic details
The food is not Mexican traditional, but more of a Latin fusion with dishes from Colombia and Cuba among the others
Excellent food presentation and mix of flavors, many choices in the wine list: these are things that leave a very good impression
As a vegetarian, I found several different suitable options in the menu
I would recommend it especially for a romantic dinner
Went there last night, had Mango glazed pork chops and crabmeat croquette, both delicious!! Also, we spotted the actor Federico(played character Furio in HBO's Sopranos)
He was humble and friendly, and also sent us drinks!! Turns out that Besito is owned by his close friend
, warm atmosphere and great service!! Too bad Furio only had one way ticket to Italy! Hope to see him back in season Six of Sopranos!!
I don't know if I got a fair view of the place because I was there on a Monday just when they opened at 5:30
As a party of 2, we were the only ones there until at least 7:30 when another party showed up
This worked to our advantage because we got good service
The menu they gave us was not as complete as the one shown on their webpage
I had the arugula salad and the salmon, both which were good
I would definitely go back to try it again
Seriously, the best
I was skeptical, but it's true
Nice spice to everything
The spicy Harissa and youghurt , with lemon dressing and Fajitha Was the best dish try
Casual atmosphere with nice, normal service!You cant beat the prices either
Its a great place to go for a cheap yet good quality meal Even though there were large groups for dining , 2 of us were taken care very well
by the staff who was very attentive
I was there with 2 friends
One was running late and I didnt think theyll seat us until she arrived
They seated us promptly and took appetizer order
Our waitress was familiar with menu and wine list
I ordered the cigars appetizer -- unbelievably delicious
Main course was good
Wines by the glass, had good variety for fish but not meat
Deserts were good
I was unable to eat most of my fish after splurging on appetizers and my friend (who arrived on time) could not finish her meat
Our waiter packed it to go and returned with a coat check tag to pick it up on way out
I found this very impressive
After recalling an extensive drink menu on the restaurant's website, I got to the bar and asked to see one
The bartender said that they didn't have one, but did say, We have mixed drinks
Not the most knowledgeable answer-so we had a glass of wine and left
I was first person there at 6:15pm which should have been a sign
Half the menu was not being offered
3 entrees were unavailable, only 1 white wine offered, only 2 red wines offered
The loud belly dancer with her scarf dragging across my food and table, almost knocked over my water glass
The food was average and service was a joke
Don't recommend to anyone
One of my favorite spaces
The chef has a great menu and pretty good wine list
The Skirt Steak is one of my favorites in the city
Good date spot - definitely worth coming back to
The restaurant was very elegant with most guests wearing suits and dresses
The service was excellent with a wine steward recommending a great wine
The food was amazing
The ambience was very nice and the restaurant was fairly small with excellent service
I would definitely recommend the place for a nice meal
Pros: wine steward
Wow! Gorgeous dining room
Very friendly service was impeccable and made you feel welcome
The value you get for the money is astounding
We ordered the regular $35 person price fixe three course dinner
We were presented with a three tier tray of extra small appetizers and an extra dessert ( The little things set the service apart)
It is an excelent restaurant, the service is out of this world
There seems to be good communication amogst the staff and that gives a very good impression
Managers are very helpful and very service oriented
It is a great place to spend a wonderful time
No doubt this place more than lived up to it's reputation
The place is beautiful, you never want to leave
From cocktails at the bar to the final taste of the wonderful dessert it was all spectacular
Food, service, timing
all perfect
Go for business, pleasure ora special time
eat everything
Too many items to recommend just 2 or 3
If only the wine was a bit more reasonable
Went with a party of 4, had to ask for water and bread
Menu offered was completely different than one online
Food was slow to arrive and not really worth the wait
Wine list was horrible and staff could not describe food, wine or menu
Don't bother

We went on a weeknight
The food was delicious, specifically the salads, sea bass and duck - but over priced (especially since we were given a menu with moderate prices which, when the bill came, we learned was the lunch menu! And prices were 25-30% higher for dinner
) The wine list by the glass is pitiful and expensive
The music was extremely loud and though they offered to turn it down it just kept getting louder and more annoying
We went to Ora for dinner with a large group of poeple
There were 12 of us
We were greeted by a really sweet hostess at the door
we were then seated promptly at a corner banquette table
Thed service was very attentive, and warm
We had the 35 per person price fixed
It was worth every penny
The ambience was amazing
I love the place, I think New York needs more warm and charmin places like this

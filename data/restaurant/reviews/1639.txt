I stopped in for a quick bite in the area and was surprised that I got a table full of food for about $5-8 per person! The service was attentive and polite
I've been back already
I don't recommend it on a really cold night though
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST INDIAN RESTAURANTS THAT IV'E EVER BEEN IN ,I HOPE YOU GET A CHANCE TO VISIT THIS SUPERB RESTAURANT ,IT'S A VIRTUAL FEAST!
Its a very nice restaurant, I had very good shrimp vindaloo and the garlic nan was excellent
The beers are uncommon in New York, very authentic Haywards from India which I like very much
Good place for date, my wife liked the lamb biryani
Will visit again when innm the village
Good job yar
We've been visiting this restaurant for almost six years and have been very happy with the great food and value
I really love the tandoori, especially the garlic nan
The food is fresh and spicy and quality is so good even for takeout
The sag panir and malai kofta are my favorites, my boyfriend likes the spicy lamb
I've tried most of the menu and its all very good: however, skip the south indian dishes -- they weren't good
The service is sometimes abrupt but its getting better
Its nice that they have the bar again but I think they need a bartender
If you are on the street, you have to try this place -- its the best!
then don't eat here
However, if you have a leisurely evening ahead of you, this is the place to go
They certainly don't rush you
The food tasted bland (meaning not spicy at all), and the service, while earnest, was on the slow side
I loved the decor and the background music
I would head back if I had sufficient time for this dining experience
We even had coconut-rice pudding on the house! Good for a romantic or a friendly meal
PS - Skip the coconut soup
Too greasy
And the vegetable biryani was not that exciting
However, the chick pea dish
mmmm
If you are looking for the best vegetarian meal go to Gandhi
We took a group of 18 people straight from the Ashram to Gandhi and had a fabulous dinner
They even accomodated the trully vegan members of our party without sacrifising any of the taste
The hand painted walls make for a pleasant setting and the service was professional
O'M SHANTI
We had a wonderful dinner for four at this busy but inexpensive restaurant on Curry Row
The vegetarian dishes were especially good
My girlfriend had the tandoori mixed grill and thought it was one of the freshest and tastiest ones she has had
The breads were really good
The service was good too, prompt and courteous -- unlike most of the restaurants on the street
And they don'thave any christmas light decorations here
GO FOR IT NOW
Having moved to NY from London I have been craving good Indian food
I finally found it! The vindaloos were as good as the ones served in London and the prices were even better
The family owned place has a staff that is friendly and service was terrific
They even made up a dish for us that wasn't on their menu
Its the best on the Street!
12 (yes 12) of us had dinner here last night
I live in the neighborhood and recommended Gandhi as a good Indian restaurant
No one was disappointed
The waiters were very patient (what with 12 women changing their minds while ordering!), and attentive to us; clearing plates, refilling water glasses
The food and drinks came promptly
The portions were large enough for us to share
Most surprising to my friends was the bill; around $17 per person
That included drinks, appetizers, entrees, coffee, tea and desserts
All were delighted that they now have a new Indian place to go to
The Scene The stately, '80s-tinged room feels mildly dated, but it's still a deluxe space, with soaring ceilings and well-spaced tables that keep the din of the always-packed restaurant to a minimum
The professional, unhurried service is more formal than friendly, often to the point of aloofness
At midday, the restaurant fills with lunchers from nearby offices; dinner draws a special-occasion crowd as well as jacket-and-tie regulars
The Food Chef Alfred Portale's kitchen turns out confident, vibrant New American cuisine
Moist and creamy roasted cod, crispy skin intact, shows magnificent flavor and texture; lush homemade squash ravioli with oxtail sauce is superb
Roast pheasant's strong flavor harmonizes with a sweet-tart poached apple, and bacon lends richness to a surprisingly delicate duck breast
Occasional dishes falter, however, like a daunting portion of one-note venison sausage
The varied, elaborately composed desserts end the meal with style
What a goooooorgeous restaurant! I had lunch there today and was immediately so impressed with the ambiance
Lots of businesspeople in suits and a very classy crowd
The service was fantastic
very attentive and they all truly seemed to want you to have a perfect experience there
I got the $24 prix fixe, which was an absolute STEAL! The asparagus salad was fantastic, the mahi mahi literally melted in my mouth, and the warm flourless chocolate cake with mango sorbet was phenomenal
If you don't want to spend $70+ on a dinner, the lunch prix fixe is a great way to try the cuisine without dropping all the money, and I was perfectly satisfied with the lunch
Truly an outstanding restaurant
I can't afford this place, but I went during Restaurant Week
One of the better restaurants that lives to the hype
I've tried other high-end restaurants, and I didn't think they were all-that
But Gotham really lived up to the hype
It's a business class type restaurant, a lot of people in suits and dressed to the nines
The service is impeccable and they really look to make sure you are taken care of
The food had flavor, taste and it melts in your mouth-goodness
The portions are middling, but it was just right - because for an appetizer, entre and dessert, I was full
The manager was cold and rude from the minute we walked in
She proceeded to get only worse as she hustled us out of our table when it was obvious they neither needed the table nor were closing anytime soon
Once outside and in front to hail a cab, the manager and hostess gossiped about us and then glared at us
I will never go back here ever
I have never been treated worse at any restaurant, let alone one where you're dropping $200 a person
Engjoyed the 3 course lunch at the fabulous bar, such a deal ($24
70)
Asparagus/beet salad, mahi mahi and warm choc
cake with an amazing espresso/walnut ice cream
Love the spacious dining room and the bar is great for solo diners
A good way to take advantage of a pricier NYC establishment
Dinner is first class all the way
Everything was fabulous from the wine to the food to the ambiance
The service was top shelf and the level of attention that we received went above and beyond the call
This is a great place to have dinner or even just for drinks
Parking is ample; the location is great if you are in LM
The food here is fabulous
However, when I spend that much money on a meal, I expect an experience that includes top-notch service
Yes, the server was courteous, but made absolutely no attempt to connect with our table of 4
Everything the wait staff did was very mechanical -- as one reviewer mentioned, no smiles and no sincerity
The minute we finished our first bottle of wine, she asked, Should I bring another? in a way that seemed more fitting for a restaurant less successful
I would be willing to give Gotham another chance, but I'd much rather spend my money at Union Square Cafe, where the ambience, service, and food were much, much better

The only reason I settle for it from time to time is there isn't a great Persian restaurant anywhere in the city
The food is tired and seems to be recovering from a hangover
Decent service, okay space, but in a city with so little competition, I think Persepolis has resigned to dishing out minimal effort
While I have to agree, the Sour Cherry Rice was utterly delicious, everything else was just ok
In fact, the plates were basically loaded with rice, and very little meat or vegetables
I can make rice at home and eat just that for an 1/8 of the price
Service was also so-so - took an hour for the waiter to refill our water after we asked at least 5 times! The ambience was blah - the tables might as well have been communal
If you've never had Persian food, it's an experience
If you can live without it - do
I love this place
Food is always yummy, and the sour cherry rice makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Reasonably priced too
Really a find
Located in the 74th-75th Streets restaurant row, this Persian restaurant is a good place the try out the exotic Middle Eastern cooking
Menu is full of marinated meats to exotic rice
The food is simple and very tasty
You can't go wrong with this place
I believe the owner used to be goal keeper for a soccer team in Iran
He has his team picture up on the wall
One of the best Middle Eastern restaurants in the city
This restaurant makes some of the best middle eastern food I've tasted
Everything is great but if you're a first-timer you must try the sour cherry rice
I am not a meat eater but I can't resist their chopped meat kebabs
Wonderful service, not too long a wait for tables, price is right - in a word, go!
My boyfriend and I recently went to Quatorze for a Friday night date - the service was excellent! I had the wonderful goat cheese salad and roasted chicken with cous cous, which was on the specials menu
A very nice evening; I would recommend it for a quiet dinner with family or a date - a good UES spot
Great bistro food, with a warm neighborhood feel
The staff is attentive and friendly, and the food is excellent
It might be a bit expensive, but all the intangibles make it worthwhile
Quartorze has the BEST goat cheese salad
I have tasted my goat cheeses salads in France and in the U
S
and I truly believe that Quartorze makes the best in the U
S
The goat cheese is fresh and the salad dressing is delicious!
A true touch of Paris on 79th St
Memorable bistro fare-particularly:The Gruyere tart,grilled chiken,sirloin steak, pommes frites,apple tart-decent wine list-hardworking,knowledgable staff
Picey-but worth it!
I guess I just don't understand why everyone thinks this place is so great
I went there twice - just in case maybe the first time was an off night and both times we sat in the TINY, cramped dining room and had good, but not anything special, cheap pasta
I guess it's good if you are on a budget
(And who isn't these day?) The food was very average and the service less than
I would not eat here a 3rd time
Got there earlly, so I can't comment on rush hour, but the pasta was outstanding and the service was superb
I used to live a block away, and we frequented this place often
Even though it's not terribly convenient to where I live now, I still go back on occasion
It's TINY, so be prepared, but the food is amazing, and the prices are low
It's BYOB, and there's a liquor store just around the corner
The waitstaff was professional yet very gruff
The food was over cooked and WAY overpriced
Went here and the waiter was extremely jovial
Had the Clams Oreganata
very Good
Then I went back to a simple dish
Meatballs and spaghetti
tasty But the meatballs were way too small
A bottle of Brunello
Tiramisu and cappucino ran about $100 a head
High, but sometimes, you just gotta check it out
I know we all don't like to order gnocci b/c most places can't make it well, but the gnocci here is the most incredible EVER
Tasty and LIGHT and FLUFFY (and when was the last time you heard those three adj when talking about gnocci???)
The wine comes in a huge red wine glass filled to the brim, and the house cabernet is DELICIOUS
The service is excellent and friendly and the food is quite quite quite good! Fabulous!
we loved the food worthy of review go there soon very soon
I went there on night to have a nice romantic dinner with my husband
The waiter spilled the wine on my husband's pants and he just sorry and he walked away
he never came back
A men who were sitting next to us saw whole thing then he told manager that he shouln't have just walked away
there was candle with no light
price was outrageous
we ate one fish and a bttle of wine and salad we ended up paying $180
we will never go back there again
The citysearch rating is surprising to me as I found the service at Trata to be downright obnoxious
The food was fine, not terrific but adequate
The cost was outrageous
$35 for Artic Char, one of their house grills, no price listed by the way
Our experience was so bad that we spoke to a manager who's only response to our ordeals of the evening was Sorry and then he walked away
The prices and service completely overshadow the lovely outdoor seating, which in my opinion was the only nice thing about the place
Casual, comfortable space that is much enhanced by the wonderful quality of seafood and the friendly service
Despite the above average cost, don't expect anything fancy here
The food is straightforwardly prepared without some of the aesthetic flourishes you may expect at the prices you're paying
Everyting here was great
The service was exceptional and the selection of fresh fish just what we wanted
All the wines are Greek and there is a great story on the wine list about Greek wines
The waiter was helpful because we knew nothing about greek wines
Although by no means inexpensive, it is well worth the money
The seafood specials are out of this world
Although all of the specials seem great, I have to get the Tiger Prawns every time I'm there
Easily one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in the city
Cannot be beaten for seafood quality and preparation
Lots of fresh, whole fish
Very tasty
Stuff prepared Greek style
Definitely worth going to
The best Italian food and service around! For the last three years we have been returning regularly to this hidden treasure on the Upper East Side
The bread, pasta (especially the gnocci), and service are outstanding
Such great food - the fresh, warm bread is a perfect start, small, intimate ambiance feels perfect and the service is generally reliable and attentive
Water glass is always filled and they'll make good recommendations off the menu
You can't go wrong with any item - best gnocchi you'll ever have, and that's a bold statement!
We've been coming here for over 10 years and have always loved the food
Over the years the staff has of course turned over many times, so service has varied

It does succeed in [providing nice guacamole-but to get a nice helping on emust pay over 10 bucks
To get a decent meal, one has to purchase the salsa, beans, sour cream, and frijoles negroes as separate entities
BIZARRE
It makes no sense to me how people say Mary Ann's is on the list of Best's
They must buy the Taco Bell kist at Gristedes
Mary Ann's make decent Margarita's if not from the frozen machine
In more ways than one
you can't even find the chicken underneath!
The guocamole at Mary Ann's is SO good, just as good as you'll find in California
Great chips salsa, margarita's that are strong tasty, and some very hardy fare
I love it!!!!
great margaritas, great food (try the enchiladas espinacas)
brunch on sundays a must
watch the game
huge projection TV!!
Guacamole is heavenly
Food was scrumptions, and I loved the vegetarian selections
Not real good! There are so many places better than this joint
The atmosphere at Mary Ann's (downtown) is noisy, but well worth the noise
The margaritas are among the best in town, and the steak with cheese, onions, tomatoes is the best
I will delay going home after work, and I live pretty far away from the City to have that for dinner at least once a month
Being a Texan, I was very disappointed in the food
It is not authentic Mexican food, but is a poor attempt at Tex-Mex
I've been twice to give them a second chance, but I won't go again
My boyfriend and I both had mexican seafood dishes
They weren't so great
Kind of fishy
And his was not real fresh
looked like frozen seafood
I have been to Mary Ann's and being a Mexican, I would not call that Mexican food
Who ever called this Mexican food obviously hasn't had real Mexican food
If you want to try REAL Mexican food try going to Spanish Harlem you'll find authentic Mexican food and it is a lot cheaper too! I recommend Taqueria El Paso
We went with a party of 10 so I got to see a variety of dishes
If you for some reason feel inclined to go here opt for the basic taco stuff
The spinach burrito was gross
I would have rather gone to taco bell
Maryann's is TEX-MEX, NOT Mexican
And even at that, it serves below mediocre Tex-Mex at best
the best mexican Restaurant in new york city! food is great and the services is terrific
mary ann's is a nice place to go teh worker there make it seem liek if you were in your home
The food is verty Good the magaritas are the best in NYC
The service is very good in other word whenyou go to mary ann's you have a good time
I love the freshmade quacamole, salsa and tortillas
Also great margaritas and healthy vegetarian dishes also
I have been here several times over the last two years, not of my choosing
It has always been horrible
the food inedible, the service atrocious and the atmosphere miserable
The decor was awful
Cramped and dimly lit with diner type booths
The food was mediocre
The service was ok
There are enough Thai places in NYC that you don't need to go here
The reasonable prices and delicious Thai food are not to be missed
The family-run restaurant has good customer service and an OUTSTANDING Tom Kha Gai (Chicken Coconut Soup
) Also try the noodle dishes, curries (particulary the Masuman Tofu) and Salmon Thai Style
Support this quiet, neighbrohood place!  They also do good parties for large gropus
We had a banquet in February of 2002 with 17 people and they served us all with ease and even tallied the check correctly
The Scene Bursts of cherry blossoms wash the dining room in vibrant color; perfect handfuls of orchids make equally lovely impressions on tabletops
And swags of gold silk, curvaceous sconces and tented tables add a sense of playful whimsy to the room
Refreshingly, service follows suit: Not only is it well-versed, but it's also, at times, fun
The Food Every meal here is a celebration, from an amuse bouche of warm gougers to oh-so-perfect, itty-bitty candies and chocolates which end the evening on a charming note
But it's the attention to detail in between that impresses most: Foie gras, given two treatments--one savory, one sweet--adds intrigue to the presentation of this luxe mainstay
White asparagus flown in from Provence during the height of the season, tenderly dressed with warm, buttery poached egg dressing, reveal the kitchen's masterful restraint, impeccable sourcing and subtle ability to woo a diner's palate
I took my girlfriend here for a night out of the home
We were given a private room and the best service one could hope for
The food was outstanding
It was the first time traveling to New York with my boyfriend and one that I will always remember
He'd looked up the top 10 restaurants in the world and Daniel popped up
I made a reservation a month in advance and very glad I did
We arrived 30 minutes early but they cheerfully greeted us and had a table already waiting
Our waiters were exceptionally well dressed and helped me pick out a great wine
Our water was always filled and the bread guy was determined to let my boyfriend try every different bread that existed
I took a restroom break only to discover that when I got back, they replaced my silverware and covered my dinner
The food was fantastic and cooked to perfection as well as the dessert
We ordered the three course meal and were so stuffed! I highly recommend Daniel!
Ambience romantic and elegant
Everything we had was delicious, prepared to perfection, and with beautiful presentation
Appetizers; tuna tartar and ravioli
Main courses; lamb and beef dishes
Dessert; chocolat black forest (a dark chocolate lovers dream) and banana dessert
All mouth watering
Good size portions for fine dining (even too much for me
Husband finished mine)
Impressive wine list
We opted for an inexpensive bottle recommended, and really disliked it
Aside from the wine Sommelier, the staff was really superb, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive, but not intrusive
Water filled when glasses were half empty, crumbs cleaned often, wine repoured continuously, and all that jazz
It is one of our NYC favorites now and we plan to go back
Taking into consideration all the hype, this restaurant was not up to our expectations
While great for a formal or business dinner, the restaurant lacks a certain comfort level and takes itself too seriously
Service was very good, but uptight and impersonal
The only thing as delicious as dessert was David Ostad who was dining with his posse including Jessica Alba and singer Rob Thomas
Great food, but the ambience is too stiff
I am no stranger to upscale dining, and out of all the restaurants ive been to, this takes the cake
The service is unbeatable from the etiquette of the staff to the food
We had our own team of waiters serving us
Our every whim was catered too instantly
With each course they would explain in great detail what it was we had ordered
In between courses we were served trays of little samplers which were delicious
I had the veal which was cooked to perfection, for dessert I had a hot chocolate souffle, which was amazing

Everyone loves Ferrara's, so much so, that you should be prepared to wait if you'd like to be seated
If you just want to pick up a bunch of cookies pastries to go, there's a separate line for that
Ferrara's even serves gelato out front of it's storefront and has benches for you to sit
If you enjoy Italian pastries, this is the place for you; if you're looking for a slice of apple pie or chocolate cake, look elsewhere, though their Death by Chocolate is so rich, you won't be able to finish it
I did have to ask my server 3 times for a glass of water and things were slow in coming, but I guess if you are a fan, you'll overlook it
I've loved everything I've had here
The cheesecake, the eclairs, the cannolis
it's definitely a great place to go after enjoying a meal at another Little Italy restaurant
Highly, highly recommended
The service is slightly sub par but very worth it
Really delish
Went thinking I would find real, authentic Italian pastry's
Brought my Italian husband, but very dissappointed
Pricey, poor service and looked like a tourist trap
Next time I'm in town I'll find better! They've fallen into getting the tourist dollars
over-rated, use to be good 15-20 yrs
ago
desserts are so so tasting a little pricey
canoli good, but other selections either too sweet, too much creme or too much pastry
uncomfortable seating
busy cuz it's popular
SUM IT: i'd suggest the other 'ferrara's around the corner with better pastries italian ices
this ferrara's is too touristy for me
Lovely restaurant, we had a late lunch of veal-stuffed manicotti which was extremely tasty
The ricotta cream-filled cannoli is SO delicious I am still dreaming about it! Endless dessert menu, not a huge variety of savouries but I think anything you ordered would be delicious
We loved this place will definitely visit next time we are in NY
If you have a sweet tooth or want a great cup of joe, then this is the place to go! The dessert list goes on and on
Nothing to dissapoint on the menu
In the summer months gelato is available too
This spot has become a regular brunch spot for the my beau and I
Nice atmosphere, good service and good food!
Best Indian food I have ever eaten
The only thing I regret about moving out of Pelham is the fact that I can now only eat at Rangoli once per month, instead of twice per week
The staff is unbelievably friendly, and I dream about their Saag gosht
so good
Go there!
Sports Plus a/k/a the Comfort Zone is not really your typical neighborhood bar
Neighborhood bars don't usually charge at the door, but it's all good
Drinks are good
With a laid back atmosphere and good music, you get a mix of people (some locals, sometimes a cop hangout) who usually seem to know eachother
People who move away from the neighborhood, seem to return occasionally to hang at the Sports Bar
It can get pretty tight and there's a lot of flirting going on with an occasional bump and grind on the makeshift dancefloor
There's so much people watching that you forget it's a SportsBar!! There's a large screen for watching games and you can rent the place for a private party
Food is only good if you're starving and have the munchies
My friends and I go to Enzo's weekly for dinner
This place has the best traditional Italian food around
The decor needs some sprucing up, but the service is phenomenal
Everything we've eaten there is just off the charts - from the veal siciliana (one of my absolute favorite meals on the planet) to the pasta fagioli to the tartuffo
They even have sorbet in hollowed out fruits for dessert - delicious! As I said, the place itself will impress nobody - but who cares? The staff is so friendly that you feel right at home, and i simply cannot say enough about the food
Absolutely delicious food! Incredible portions
If they have the Pork Bracciole on the menu, ORDER IT! Never have I had anything so succulent
I never thought any bracciole dish would beat my mothers - this does!!! The mussels marina are a must for an appetizer, although you can't go wrong with the stuffed artichoke either
As for the pasta, they are all great
My niece routinely orders a double portion and I'd be hard-pressed to say that there are any leftovers
Be prepared to wait for a table on a Friday or Saturday night but, mark my words, the wait is well worth it!
Enzo's is our favorite restaurant
We loved it so much that we held our rehearsal dinner here (in the back room)
The service is fantastic
It's a very down to earth place
If you go during Mother's Day, be prepared to wait for a table
The risotto is out of this world
Two words: Free wine
I'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet
We bring in a party of ten or so every week
Order the panang duck, it's fantastic
Then, get ripped on free box wine
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter
If you live in Upper Manhattan, Siam Square is THE place for Thia food
While the prices are nothing special, the portions are huge
In fact, two people could really share one plate
The flavors are great, and the menu is extensive
Plus, on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited!
if your into thai
you cannot miss this great restaurant
if you dont even like thai-food
still go there
i recommend going there just for the atmosphere and kind people alone
they live up to the thai way of living
you get nothing but smiles and great food at siam square
the jo and bo team equal great times and even better food/drink! you guys rock
i recommend the thai popcorn :)
I am a regular at Siam Square, especially on Wednesdays, when they offer free unlimited house red/white wine with a purchase of an entree
Located in Riverdale, this is by far the best Thai food that I've had in NYC
It's location though makes it inconvenient for many in NYC, but it is worth making the trek
The service is always attentive and friendly
My recommendations for food are the shrimp appetizer, any duck entree, the Thai flavor ice cream (pandan especially)
There are also daily specials that are usually very good, but a little more pricey
Overall, the prices are moderate
I highly recommend this place for anyone who has a palate for good Thai
For many people, this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic
However, being from Los Angeles and Thai myself, this place reminded me a lot of the hundreds of Thai restaraunts all over L
A
county
The only thing is that the prices are a bit high (but hey I will pay it to get a taste of home)
Everything we had was pretty good, but we have only been there once
Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood)
But this is the best all around Thai Experience Ive had outside of Bangkok and LA  Dishes I recommend: -Tom Yum Soup - Drunken Noodles (pad Kee Mao)  (I wil update with more later) I should be going back this week
i've had thai food all over the place in new york city and west chester
in my opinion, based on how many Thai people eat in thai restaurants, i had heard other thai people talk about this restaurant and i had seen other thai people eat here often
i dine here myself on special occasions and sometimes not, but the food is always like home

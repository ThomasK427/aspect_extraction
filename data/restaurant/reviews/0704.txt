drank greek wines for the first time,started with wine made by monks? small green bottle, main course syrah tsantali good value - service was extreme attentive
I am striclty a seafood eater - every time i visit Thalassa they always amaze me with new, interesting seafood
Medit

by the waiter was great
Appetizer rock shrimp with tzatziki sauce - good also
Great wines
downstairs was a party - alot of nice looking people

Visited last night and it was a wonderful surprise
I hadn't read the reviews so went expecting a good meal and was overwhelmed
The seafood is incredibly fresh
The lobster on the fish table were still moving about! The service was warm and attentive
The moussaka, zucchini blossom stuffed with crabmeat and baklava were excellent
The fish by the pound is a treat
Many fresh selections from the Med seasoned with capers lemon and grilled to perfection
Extensive wine selection
And the space is amazing
The offwhite marble, blue light fixtures and airiness will make you believe you're on the sea
I went to this place on a Tuesday, and it was empty (only 3 or 4 tables), so ambience was kind of cold
I sat at the bar to wait for my friend and asked fo a glass of Chardonnay
Well, I should have asked for the price before
they charged me $14 for this glass!!!! This is unbelievable
I won't go back to this place
1 1/2 Lb Shrimp
yes Shrimp not lobster (those are 6 Lbs) try the exotic Fish not on the menu and a must have is the Flower stuffed with lump crab meat
As soon as my glass was empty there was a wait staffer there to refill it
(its the little things that count)
When I walked in for lunch, it was at first a little intimidating because the design space is so modern nice
It was not what I expected from the outside
Service was very professional very attentive
Food was good as well
Small portions but very tastefully done
Thalassa is a nice new addition to the Tribeca restaurants
The ambiance is cool and minimalist
The food is fresh and bursts of flavor
I had the scallops and prawn in the tomato sauce as an appetizer which was very bold and tastey
The meal was followed by the soft shell crabs which were absolutely delicious! Tender, just salty enough and cooked to perfection
Others had the market lobster which was very good, but at $50 for the entree
I think the prices are a bit ridiculous for what you get
The desserts were less appetizing
The valrhona chocolate crepes were hard and didn't taste very fresh
The sorbets were way too sweet to finish
A good place to take clients on an expense account
I'm sorry but this place was good but not great
Honestly, people, the seafood was great but at 30-40$ a plate - that's just ridiculous
I'll admit the ambience was nice but at the end of the day - I expect good greek food
I am greek, and have eaten at greek restaurants all over the world
New York just sucks for greek food
Go to Toronto - the Greeks there know what they're doing
Okay, not great food
Service was weak as was the wine list
The prices are ridiculous; for two with one bottle of wine ($40) pre-tip was $170
If I pay this much I want to walk out saying WOW, that was a great meal and worth it
Instead, I said, WOW, that was a lot of money for grilled fish!
Thalassa takes the greek style of seafood cuisine and adds elegant decor to become one of the current hip spots in NYC dining
The variety of fish is impressive and I would particularly recommend the soft shell crab
If you're into Greek wine, this is the place for you! The selection is quite large, but you can also choose from California, Italy, or France if you're feeling less adverturous
Service is polite and attentive
The weakness of Thalassa is Value
While I thought the meal was quite good, the prices are in line with what should have been an exceptional meal
When the novelty of Thalassa's newness wears off this will become an issue
One of the best dining experiences I've had in a while
I went there with 3 Geeks
oooops I meant Greeks
and we we were all blown away with not only the fantastic menu and food, but also the service which was impeccable
and these guys I was with were all comparing it to mama's yaya's cooking back home so you know it had to be good
DEFINITELY have a martini there -- excellently executed, huge, gigantic -- and most certainly a forgettable experience
As far as food - our favs were the kalamarakia, oktopodi and lethrini
All the wait staff went beyond the call of duty
We were all more than impressed and will be back very soon
The fish is some of the freshest you will find in NYC
The quality and variety is comparable to (and possibly better than) what you find at Oceana, Fresh, RM, Milos or Esca
The staff is very knowledgeable about the different tastes of the fish and helpful in guiding you to the winners
The octopus appetizer, soft-shell crab special and lethrini were all standouts
The bi-level space is inviting and warm
The wine list is somewhat eccentric and the desserts could use some help - although the Valhrona chocolate crepes were outstanding
You will have a great meal but you will pay a steep price for it
Nice new space downtown, Thalassa is the latest of several very good Grek seafood restaurants in the city
All of them are overpriced, but as long as the fish is super fresh, it's fine to pay up
At Thalassa, that was indeed the case
I went shortly after it opened, expecting teething problems, but the service was efficient, friendly and informative
The food was great, especially the appetizers (calamari and octopus)
Recommended entrees were also very good - basically get whatever is the freshest
Wine list is all Greek, and the waiter was not that knowledgeable, so that part was a bit of a shot in the dark, but overall, a good experience
Had a birthday dinner here
We ordered the barbounia and the octopus
The barbounia dissappointed the most
They came lightly breaded and (I assume) fried, but without that lovely crispiness that you get in the islands
They were a bit soggy
The octopus had an amazing flavor (and we are aficionados)
Again, though, it lacked a certain resiliency, a toothiness
The other fish (dorado, sole, etc
) is excellent and on par with Milos for freshness and flavor
My mother's lamb shank was impeccable
The salads were nice as well
We drank some lovely retsina
The decor is nice, airy and the room noise is low
The service, youthful

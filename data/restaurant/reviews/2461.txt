Food is average
Service is average
Prices are average
We tried Roppongi for the first time last week and it was excellent
The selection of sushi, rolls and hot entrees is vast
The Chef's sushi rolls are great
I had several that were unique and tasted great
Prices are very reasonable and the restaurant has good decor
Skip Haru and its overrated and overpriced sushi across the street and check out Roppongi
Where is Roppongi? This is your first question after you enter there and take a look at the menu
it was my favorite Japanease restaurant in NYC and now is the worst!  The menu is completely changed, most of the good entrees disappeared
you can certainly find a better sushi taste (and cheaper) in every supermarket in NYC!!!
Roppongi totally surpassed my expectations and is better than Haru across the street
Their selection will satisfy any sushi eater and their spicy sauce was the best
The Scene The homey interior features countrified decor with exposed brick walls covered in quilts and knick-knacks, and a cow motif prevails without irony
Friendly servers offer helpful suggestions and guide diners through the popular list of daily and nightly specials
During nice weather, a few outdoor tables offer prime Upper West Side people-watching on Amsterdam Avenue
The Food Popular breakfast and brunch menus are comprised of wholesome and old-fashioned food: Irish oatmeal, perfectly fluffy omelets (named after New York neighborhoods) and bacon that's extra thick and lean
Pumpkin French toast and chocolate-chip coconut pancakes come with real maple syrup and strawberry butter
At dinner, the quesadilla of the day is a popular starter
Entrees consist of cozy culinary Americana like mac and cheese, fish-and-chips and a classic meat loaf with mashed potatoes
Made-from-scratch desserts are a sure bet for ending the meal with flourish
I've been to GETE numerous times over the last few years, although only for brunch, never dinner
The lines are long, and the food is good, but only by comparison to what's available in the neighborhood
Lately, in particular, the food has taken a turn for the worse
The last few times I've gone for Sunday brunch the waffles and pancakes tasted like they'd been cooked the day before and left under a heat lamp
The bacon, usually thick and hearty, was cold and fatty
And the kitchen has screwed up our orders several times
It's a simple menu, people, what's the problem? I'd like to say GETE is good enough, but it's simply not
While this restaurant doesn't receive as much hype as Sarabeths, Freds, or even Popover, the breakfast/brunch is just as good - if not better
This cozy, country-esque joint makes you forget the hustle and bustle that's outside its front door
The servers are always friendly and quick to refill up your cup of coffee
(In fact, one the waitress' even has a warm, Southern twang)
Most importantly, this place serves the best french toast in the UWS
Both the pumpkin french toast or the cinnamon raisin come highly recommended
Their egg dishes are excellent as well
Every time I frequent this place for brunch, I love the food and find myself wondering what happened to the waitstaff
While waiting for the food and staring at my empty cup (dying for some coffee), I swear that I won't come back
But, the food wins me over every time
Its always delicious!
We ordered takeout here and encountered the following problems:  - Delivery took 90 minutes to arrive instead of 30 minutes as promised
- Food arrived cold and soggy
- Entrees differed significantly from menu descriptions
The vegetarian pizza included shrimp
- Staff was exceedingly rude when politely confronted with problems mentioned above
- Manager promised refund over phone, then changed her mind when we went in to collect
There are many great restaurants in Manhattan
Save yourself the time and money - avoid this one
Recently we were visiting a friend in New York and he suggested Good Enough to Eat for Brunch on the Upper West Side
Don't let the line discourage you from trying this fabulous down home restaurant, it goes rather fast
The menu is very adequate ranging from Strawberry Almond Waffles to a dish called the Lumber Jack and Mimossa's
All of us are from Ohio and the midwest feel and the quaint dining room are sure to make you feel you aren't in the middle of the city
The waitstaff seems like they'd rather be somewhere else, and frankly so did I
The biscuits were like something from mcdonalds, the omlette was sub-par, the pancakes were barely average
Luckily we eventually managed to flag down our waiter for a second cup of coffee to wash down the uninspired food
Sub-par food and service that ranged from indifferent to rude, not a winning combination
The hostess was exceptionally horrible as she snapped at members of my party for moving out of the way as an elderly man was departing and condescendingly ltelling us that we couldn't split the bill more than 2 ways
Furthermore, food was disappointing at best, and it took 30 minutes to get a beer and 4 different requests to get a pickle that should have come with one of the sandwiches, even though the place was only half full
Good enough to eat, what a joke-- more like Bad enough to stay home!
Came for brunch and didn't have to wait very long to get what looked like a nice tabel outside, until we noticed the bus stop
How about a little diesel exhaust with your coffee? The service was prompt and adequate
The big downer sat on the plate like limp cardboard: The waffles tasted like they had been made the night before, left out and then halfway reheated in the microwave
Limp, chewy, dense
You can make much better yourself at home
The rest of the food was fine, including fruit, egg white omelet and coffee
while it is a small place, the service is great and it is very low key
Great food and the pumpkin french toast is the best
I will definatly be visiting good enough to eat again
The meatloaf ($16
95) that others love was bland, mashed potatoes cold and tasteless, and peas and carrots were as good as you would make at home
My fish of the day, halibut ($21
95) was made with a lemon sauce, and although tasty, did not go well with the sweet flavored lentils served with it
The salad served with the meal was fine, but nothing special
The bread was like diner rolls that are often left on the plate
An Ice tea was a pricy three dollars
The service was fine, child friendly, and the food came quickly, but this very average meal did not match the expensive price
We were hoping to find an upper west side gem, but instead got a cubic zirconia
We will not return
The wait staff could care less about you or your business but once you get past the snub waitresses and rush rush rush finish, you just may return anyway
Why? They serve terrific traditional American comfort food
Skip the dry, flavorless corn bread and order the meat loaf
I thought my mother made great meat loaf (sorry mom)
As a side, the broccoli mashed potatoes were something I never tried before and were excellent as were the vegitables
Not too over cooked or too crunchy
You may want to skip desert as well
The cakes are okay, but not great
Forget about the staff and go for the food and pleasant, if a bit cramped Lancaster, Pennsylvania like decor for comfort
What better recommendation than to say we''l go back
stumbled upon it after getting mad and leaving Popovers up the street -- a totally different experince -- great wait staff friendly fast but not rushed experience with delicious breakfast
As a resident of the UWS, I can tell you it's hard to find good inexpensive food up here - so Good Enough To Eat is a rare find
Everything is fresh and home made, the prices are very reasonable for this area, the portions are huge, and the service is friendly
The Bloody Mary comes in an enormous milkshake glass, the pancakes are fluffy and perfect (with real maple syrup on the table!), the bacon and sausage are flavorful and high-quality - even the biscuits are awesome, and they come with fresh strawberry butter
This is a restaurant to tell friends about
Sleep in, show up at 2 so you can get a seat
This was quite possibly the worst breakfast that I have ever tasted
The waffles were completely tasteless and the only difference between the flavors is the miniscule amount of toppings that they put on top
The honey mustard dressing on the mesclun salad made it impossible to finish
the only good thing that I tasted was the cranberry juice
Definitely not worth the amount of money that I shelled out for it
This place is one of my favorite brunch sites in the city

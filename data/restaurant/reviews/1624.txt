You may get a table faster!
Minute place, so don't imagine a large eatery
Good service and nice food
Music was very interesting, although almost pass
Good food and well-prepared drinks
The owner was there, checking everything out
Go there, have fun and enjoy 1st Street
It's a great spot at one of the best unknown streets in Manhattan
I make the above statement obviously from a personal experience
I'm still with the guy I met that first date at the Elephant
Call it bias or whatever else those dissenting customers have proclaimed but I will always attribute one of the most memorable nights of my life to this restaurant
The food was good, the atmosphere buzzing and I don't know who bitched about the service but we were served well
Drinks were always at hand, the wait for a table was barely over ten minutes (have you entered without reservation at some of the other places in this damn city!??) and overall very friendly
I endorse this restaurant wholeheartedly and I'm going back there on my one-year anniversary
Yes, the Elephant can be noisy and crowded at times and it's fast paced but it's always a party
The host is often crazy and so is the bar but it's fun and it's easy to make friends there
The staff is very sweet and attentive even if it's busy
I always have a blast
And the food's not bad eather
this place is such a waste of time
you wait forever for a table only to be seated practically right next to someone else
the food is way overpriced for what they were serving
i don't see the difference between their dishes and other thai dishes in the area for half the price down the street
i ordered the sticky rice wrap and it came cold
staff was not friendly and neither were the wannabes that crowds the front (bar) of the restaurant
Don't let the small quarters deter you - this place is worth a visit! I love the crab cakes, salmon, and moo shu
The shrimp in the pad thai were the best I've had outside Louisiana in a long time
I would never go back to this restaurant, even if someone offered me money!! The host was rude and obnoxious
We were moved twice and the check was bought to our table before we even finished our meal
Before we can even order desert, the waitress comes and tells us we have to leave because the host wanted our table
it was a Tuesday night
And I find out from my friends that they've received similar service in the past- cannot believe how anyone would go back
in NYC, you can get similar quality food at similar prices in a lot of other places!!
The food here never disappoints
The space is small and the service is only average, but the food makes up for it
Go for dinner on a weeknight!
The food was excellent
But don't expect to be able to hear your date
The restaurant was very loud and very crowded so you were basically ontop of your neighboring table
BUT, the food was really good and flavorful
Found it just walking around the neighborhood
What a gem! Great ambiance
The food was fantastic, the crab cake app delicious, if you like heat have the BBQ Salmon
Prices are extremely resonable and the wine list very eclectic
The service was amazing and so attentive considering the place filled up within 15 minutes of our arrival
Have that housemade Chocolate Cake dessert
It will cool everything off beautifully
What makes The Elephant stand out as a restaurant worthy of return visits is the fact that the food's delicious flavors are also unique and memorable
I am referring specifically to the crabcake appetizer (the best my companion and I have ever had) and the beef salad
Moreover, the drinks are strong enough to make you forget the cramped quarters and the desserts are the perfect way to cool off your palate at the end of the meal
I really don't comprehend the presence of negative reviews
I arrived before my group for dinner and was told to wait at the bar until my party was complete
After scrunching into the tiny bar area and ordering a drink, I was annoyed but couldn't help but notice the handsome bartender having a tete-a-tete with another French-speaking cutie
Turns out the owner and waiters parlent francais as well
Oh yeah, the food's just alright for the price
Tiny place but with a clever design
They utilize every inch of the room
Food is very good
(Bordering on over-priced) Typical host (with the French sounding accent) who does a good job cramming you in
Try this place at an off peak time
Recently went with some friends, service was great (the waitress and the owner both very friendly), the food was both delicious and presented beautifully
Very cute, I'll go again
(If you like coconut, try the coco martini
although the wait can be long, and you sit only an inch from the next table, the food and lively atmosphere make this place a winner
really delicious
Cramped quarters, and the wait can be a nightmare at times, but if you have the patience, the food is well worth it
Fun, party-like atmosphere (loud), but lots of energy
Always packed, so be prepared to wait a bit
Perfect place to get a drink and a delicious, exotic bite before heading to the Sunshine theatre or the Lower East Side----convenient location
A good one to keep in mind for the hood
The food and service were excellent
Great location and very nice aesthetics, everything you would expect for a Thai Bistro in the East Village
This is a great place to bring a date or a group of friends
Be sure to try the leechy martini!
being there ten times allways loved it, very good food, great drinks, good music ( sometimes too loud
) good service on slow nights
If you do not like it please stay away it is so crowded alredy
We were asked if we wanted desert and said no; but were waiting for an appetizer (one party was still hungry) and were told that would take 10 minutes
Two minutes later, the waitress said we NEED the table, you can not have the appetizer that you ordered
I have NEVER had such AWFUL SERVICE anywhere
The food was OK, the portions were small, and the above speaks for the service (also the waitress woudl fill your water one inch, rather than the whole way)
the food here is excellent and imaginative
you can save some cash by splitting the very filling appetizers
it is absurdly crowded on the weekend
Guys, I have been going there for a while now and have never! been disappointed with the food
It is fantastic what they bring on the table
It is very nicely decorated and tastes great
But
the dinner in two shifts is really going too far
it is so crowded and you either can be there before 7 pm or after 9:30 pm for a dinner-shift
I alsways have to remind my friends that they only take Amex or cash, which is not very convenient
The food brings me back again and again
maybe I will go for in the future for a lunner (lunch/dinner) in the middle of the afternoon to avoid the crowds
It's always good to get here before 7pm for dinner and attentive service
I've been here once a year for the past 5 and it's still good! The Spicy Fries eaten with ketchup and hot sauce is my fave
Crab Cakes with the only real green papaya salad I can find in the city is savory
In addition, the Curry Chicken was cooked just right in a light broth
However, I felt the Pad Thai was too salty even after I added the lime
The shrimp in it was plentiful and plump though!
I can only imagine that the positive reviews herin are made by owners and staff or this restaurant

Finally the waiter came over and I explained to him the fish had gone bad
He took the plate away and I never saw him again
The food runner came and told me that I couldn't order anything else because the kitchen was now closed
I ended up sharing my girlfriend's Chicken and Rice which was edible except for the burnt rice at the bottom of the plate
To my surprise when I asked for the check, a basket of bread was brought out with it! I think that this place really has to get it's act together if it wants to be considered a serious restaurant and not just a tourist trap, which it is now
Well I guess that you can't take a Spanish restaurant that serves Mexican food serious anyway
Or is this a Mexican restaurant serving Spainish food?
I brought my out-of-town sister and her fiance to Tio Pepe and was embarrassed by the end of the meal
Service couldn't have been worse, and our food was bad
We sat in the back patio, by my request, but instead of being a charming garden, it was a dirty dark room
Not pretty or fun
I'd recommend going elsewhere
Try for your self and you will keep going back when in the city
A friend and I went on a Thursday night and except for a couple of large parties the vast space of the restaurant was empty
The red wine sangria was strong but good and the guacamole was above-average
We both had the Burrito Del Norte (with veggies) and found our portions to be huge but satisfying
Overall, I would have enjoyed the experience more if the atmosphere was better
I did take a peek at their garden in the back
definitely try to get a table there
It was lit with white lights and cozier with more ambience
I recommend Tio Pepe for anyone looking for really good Spanish cuisine
After having lived in Spain for a year, I have yet to find a restaurant that is as authetic as Tio Pepe
The paella is too die for, lick your figners good! We get pitchers of margaritas and sing along with the guitarist
The prices are very reasonable and the waiters are nice
I will keep returning because so far I've only been happy!
On a slow night the service was horrible, waited excessive amount of time and manager was clueless, there was no effort to apologize
food was marginal but expected for NY Mexican/Spanish
Location is nice but I would rather spend time in a dump that has good food and service
Everything that came to the table here was fantastic
I'm always expecting a little less from restaurants in this part of town, but Tio Pepe was incredible
The octopus especially
Great Service, great drinks, you should go
I was actually on a Blind Date last night (4/29/05), and her sister recommended the place
Great choice (the eats as well as the date)
Upon entering, we were whisked to a table near the window (my fave spot)
After ordering drinks, we both decided on the Paella Vallenciana, brought out on hot plates
Neither of us were very hungry, yet we could not stop serving ourselves this fantastic, and generous cornucopia of rice, seafood and chicken
We even saw them make fresh guacomole right at someone table
The staff was great, attentive, and always within view
The atmosphere was also great
Dinner for 2, including drinks and 2 cafe au lait totaled $40
bucks
Can't wait to check out the backyard garden room this summer
By the way, my date can't wait either ; )
I threw a party at Tio Pepe's on 1/8/05 and it was absolutely fabulous
Everyone raved about the food, the service and the drinks
The staff was so friendly they became part of the family (and that was before the pitcher of Pina Colada)  If you want to simply enjoy good food in a nice atmosphere visit Tio Pepe's
Tio Pepe is a great place to try Spanish/Mexican food
For first timers, I recommend the Paella Valenciana
It's seafood with rice
The rice was delicious and I think the sauce they used was from the clams
I went with a group of 6 and the wait for the food took over an hour
Could be because it was a Sat
packed night
They served tortilla chips for munches and yet the wait was still too long
It is a restaurant that can handle groups, but I don't think the group would want to wait TOO long for their food
Tio Pepe!!! An amazing deal for such an amazing taste! When I visit New York I make a sure stop at Tio Pepe I never pass up on the Sangria
The service is beyond compare and there is a festive feel no matter what the occasion
Overall--a perfect Spanish/Mexican restaurant in the Village
I held a bridal shower in the backyard garden room and it was absolutely beautiful
The guests said it was the best bridal shower they had ever attended
Of course, they had had a few of Tio Pepe's wonderful Margaritas at that point
It is a perfect setting to hold a private event - plenty of light, plants
The food and service were excellent
The staff helped me put together an easy menu with three choices within my budget
I really have nothing negative to say about the experience
Highly recommended for a private event or a nice romantic dinner
Tio Pepe is a family-owned restaurant and you know it from the easy, at-home feeling you get as soon as you come in
The waiters are friendly and competent
It's no problem to catch a waiter's eye
They are attentive (though never obtrusive)
The menu features a wide-variety of Spanish-Mexican favorites, top-notch because the ingredients are always fresh, always first quality
Want guacamole dip? The waiter will make it fresh at your table
My favorite, the cheese quesadillas, are the best around town
Tio Pepe can become a habit real easy
Jim Smith
to a bar or club
The atmosphere was lively last night, full of groups
It's not really romantic, as the editors labeled it
The servers were friendly and it's not as expensive as I thought it would be ($11
99 for a main entree of paella)
It is very good to know a place where I can enjoy an exellent spanish-mexican food, late after theater
Great service, nice drinks and fabulous atmosphere
I think they deserve a 10 overall rating for the exellent quality
gucamole made tableside is delicious! margaritas are well priced and come in big glasses, they actually use fresh fruit! waiters are fast and professional
I've only been at Tio Pepe 4 times, but I look forward to my next visit
THE FOOD HAS ALWAYS BEEN DELICIOUS
ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS THE GUACAMOLE AND THE SANGRIA
TIO PEPE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAVORITE, EVEN WHEN I MOVED TO INDIANA, I COULDN'T WAIT TO RETURN TO NEW YORK FOR AUTHENTICITY OF MEXICAN CUISINE
What a great brunch! I ordered the fruit salad and it came in a whole baby pineapple with fresh mango, it was delicious in a honey sauce
I will surely return
The service was great and the margaritas really were delicious
Next time I'll make dinner reservations!
I'm glad to see that Tio Pepe has such great reviews on City Search
I completely agree that Tio Pepe is a great place
If you are looking for a dependable place with substance, seek out Tio Pepe
All those other trendy/flashy new spanish restaurants can't compare to the quality found at Tio Pepe
Tio Pepe is the perfect place to go after work for a few drinks and a few tapas
The bar, the sidewalk cafe, or small lounge are great places to sit
Or of course you could sit in the enclosed garden

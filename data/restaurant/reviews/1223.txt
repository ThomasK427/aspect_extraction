The desserts were also impressive! We had Banana Flan and Sorbet, but the entire menu seemed like it would be delicious
Not to mention what a courteous and helpful server we had
In general, Viet Caf was a remarkable dining experience and I would not hesitate to return!
My family and I were visiting New York and this was by far the favorite restaurant in which we ate at! The entrees and desserts (the banana flan was superb) were beyond delicious, the service was attentive, friendly, and timely, and the decor was very cozy and hip
I highly recommend ordering multiple appetizers; they are all unique and great to share
We have already recommended this restaurant to all our NYC friends, you should too!
i have never written a review before in the 5 or 6 years i've been on this site
vietcafe is worth it
i am a HUGE fan of this great restaurant
the food would suit any palate, whether it's your first time for vietnamese or you've grown up with it
i've been back many times since i came the week it opened and you can't beat the food
the charred beef dish, any pork or shrimp dish- pretty much everything is fantastic
i hope this place is around for years to come
and the artwork is amazing to top it off!
The decor is nice with lovely paintings, except we really did not like the bench seating with no back support
The kitchen area is open, so you can see the cooks work
Food is good but not exceptional
We all found the food, especially the main courses, to be overy salty
We found ourselves drinking a lot of water
I would say that the price is very reasonable
6 of us with 2 bottles of wine ($38 per bottle) with family style dining cost about $300 ($50) per person, including tax and tip
When our next table cleared out, the waiter sprayed the table with Ammonia based liquid and wiped the wooden table down, and I have to say it was a very unpleasant experience
The smell was so strong, it was offensive
They should consider a less pungent cleaning solution to spray
This Place is the bomb
This is my fiirst review ever , I am usually to lazy to write one but i have been to the CAFE about 20 times since it opened and they have consistentlly exceeded my expetations
Their food is very high quality at a very reasonable price
The owners seem to take very much pride in their product
Impeccable service, food, and personallity
You must really try this place
really!!!!!
My associates and I had dinner at Viet Cafe last evening
We found the restaurant through Citysearch and thank you! We had a 8:30 reservation, the place was packed, but our table was ready right on time
It was a beautiful restaurant visually and the food was amazing
I had the Pork and my partners had the steak, duck and salmon
All excellent
We were so thrilled to have found such a wonderful place for dinner in this area
Congrats to the owners of this relatively new restaurant for such a fine job
Service, food, ambiance - couldn't give a complaint if I tried
My partners and I will definitely become repeat patrons and are looking forward to our next Viet Cafe experience
Thank you Citysearch!
After walking in front of Viet Cafe and visiting the gallery on a number of occations, I decided to finally stopped by for dinner last night
The ambiance and decor is nice and inviting, and so are the prices! Having spent a summer in Vietnam, I'm finally glad I found a place where the food is authentic and so flavorful
Would be nice for a group, a business lunch/dinner, with friends, etc
Definitely going back soon
Great setup with the restaurant and gallery vietnam right next to each other
I had a large group family style dinner tasting authentic delicious dishes like the mien ga, lotus salad, pillow dumplings, roasted duck, tamarind snapper, and housemade desserts
Love the food!! Staff was attentive throughout the meal
I highly recommend it for groups
Afterwards, we visited the gallery which brought us into world of Vietnamese fine art
Overall a great night!
This restaurant offers different kind of Vietnamese food, from starters, entrees to dessert
The environment of the restaurant is nice
The food is good
It's the best Vietnamese food I've eaten
Will recommend to friends!!!!
Great dishes from the North, Central and the South
Not your Chinese menu like other Vietnamese restaurants in the city, but clean select dishes representing the best Viet Nam has to offer
A keeper
I dont mind the food is not authentic, small portions if theyre good, but Viet Caf was the worst Vietnamese or fusion Vietnamese food I ever had
The food was very bland, almost no flavor, poorly presented
Never go back
that's vietnamese for delicious at vietcafe
coming from a vietnamese living in new york city, i came here from california looking for some home cooking food like the ones in little saigon and lo behold i'm starting to feel less homesick! the caremelized grilled salmon was excellent and got to luv those spring rolls!! here's to many more happy returns
I had such high expectations
I convinced my friends to change dinner plans so we can eat here
I was so disappointed
The food was bland, poorly presented, portions were VERY small, and the prices were just too high
The service was poor at best
Among forgetting other things, they forgot the white rice that came with a couple of dishes and when we asked for it, the waiter reacted as if we had just asked for something outrageous
Food here is so bland, no flavor at all
Yes Lan Cao is Vietnamese but can she cook Vietnamese? Try the Phothe Broth look like soy sauce), spring rolls(can't compare any other vietnamese restaurant, Fish sauce(too much lime, Beef vermecelli ( Blanb and chewie)
Service take to long
I won't come back here again
modern, yet casual feel
marinated beef with vermicelli--typical vietnamese dish, right? but the beef is sooo tasty! ordinary dish, but superb flavor
jicama rolls were bland
the hoisin sauce is needed for flavor
spring rolls are good (not chewy)
desserts are d-e-licious! i couldn't finish the mango sorbet, but i wanted to
the banana flan was yum and wasn't annoyingly gelatinous
go with it, banana fans
and, of course, the chocolate cherry bread pudding is a MUST
it comes with two sauces: chocolate and yogurt
the chocolate sauce definitely works well
yogurt sauce is questionable
i went here with a bunch of friends and the food was amazing! i am vietnamese, so i can be critical abt vietnamese food, but i have to say, it's better than my mom's cooking! (hope she's not reading this
) each dish was distinctive with its own flavor, especially the duck - it was lean, tender and juicy, and the desserts are to die for!! there was so much food, i even got a doggie bag out of it (yea!) i'll be back!!
The nice environment is unfortunately offset by mediocre dishes
Vietnamese food should not be this bland, and portions are very small
And how can anyone charge $5 for a small plate of french fries?
I wish the rating system went beyond a 10 - this place is a 99
9
The tuna sandwich is to die for, the chickpea soup melts in your mouth, without burning your tongue, and the hot chocolate brings you back to sledding in your backyard
Don't be turned off by the line that can extend down the hallway, the staff is quick and efficient, making sure it moves at a brisk pace, and not to mention the great management team always there to help you out
I highly recommend Cafe 2 - a great dining experience
I love the diavola (spicy sausage) and a'ciorta (eggplant) pizzas at Peperoncino, and they have a stuffed chicken entree that's absolutely to die for
The salads are delish as well
While the last time I went, it seemed like they'd changed my beloved eggplant pizza so that it was slightly less heavenly, and the prices seem to have risen considerably since I started going, it's still more than worth the trip
In fact, it's one of my favorite restaurants in Park Slope

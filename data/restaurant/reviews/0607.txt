Also, I suggest making your reservation for about an hour earlier than you'd actually like to be seated, since that's how long you'll be waiting when you get there, even though they'll tell you it will just be a few minutes
It's incredible this place is still in business
Plenty of other great restaurants in the area
Save your money for someplace that's worth it
waited over one hour when we had reservations
manager kept insisting it would only be a 15 minute wait for an our
eventually left the establishment after purchasing many drinks at the bar
definitely not recommended with the current manager
We went to this place on a Saturday night
It took 20 minutes to get a table
Then the disappontments began
The food took over 45 minutes
In the french tradition, the server was rude
Wehen the food finally arrived, however, I bit into nothing less than the tastiest burger I have ever had in my life
Everyone was satisfied with their food, but we missed meeting our friends that night because the dinner took too long
If you go, you must decide whether the good food is worth the horrible service
tho warm and cozy in environment, service really could be better
and if you're into wine, they'll probably have it
beers, don't expect to find any- been there twice and they never have any of their drafts and barely anything on bottle
2nd time here
Threw a birthday party there last Saturday for a friend
Our group of 10 was treated fantastically, although the service was a bit slow
T crispy salmon in corn puree is delicious
The mushroom ravioli was rich and tasty
The steak frites dish: steak a bit chewy
The frites were perfect
When they brought out the cake, turned off all the lights and the entire restaurant joined in to serenade our birthday girl
Overall a lovely experience and would definitely go again
I came here a couple of times at night and had a good time
Food is decent but nothing special, but I liked the warm atmosphere of the epicerie
I came here for brunch and had the worst experience ever
The waitresses were clueless french girls who ran around panicked but still managed to give no service to most tables
Many tables were looking around angrily, waiting on something
We waited AN HOUR for food
We asked for mustard repeatedly and it came when my friend had two fries left
Go when it's not full
Ingredients were fresh and food was OK but definitely not worth putting up with the terrible attitude of the waitstaff
Had brunch there on Sunday afternoon
as expected, it was a bit crowded, but we were seated promptly
The food was quite good, but the experience was ruined by the service
A couple who arrived 5-10 minutes after we did ordered the exact same brunch, and were subsequently served our food
No one bothered to come over and explain the fiasco, let alone refill our tiny $8 bloody marys or tiny $4 cappucinos
We finally asked what the problem was and how much longer we'd have to wait, and the reply was a shrug, and Sometimes this happens, OK? You know, it is very busy
French or not, you're in New York, sweetheart
Went there on a Monday night
They had a cd playing in repeat mode the whole night ! lol ! And it was UB40 !!! I like reggae but come one, UB40 !!! The duck cassoulet I had was way too salty
The waitresses were pretty friendly, and most of them could speak french
Nice selection of beer and wine
I would never go back there on a Monday night
I heard this can be fun on nights when they have DJ's
Enjoyed my meal here
The fries are great, cheap, and rival those at Les Halles for quality and taste
I had the charcouterie and my partner had monkfish--both were outstandingly prepared
Starters were good; the desserts were good but nothing surprising
The atmosphere was appropriately boisterous; the service was typically French as well--just like I like it, unhurried and not overly attentive
They were around when needed--what else do you need?
Very clever designed atmosphere makes you feel as though you are in France
The food was a bit slow to come out, but definitely worth the wait
Prices are decent for food, but pricey for drinks as there is an extensive beer and wine list
Try the chocolate souffle and all-you-can-eat mussels and fries on Mondays
I cannot remember a worse dining experience than this
The food was not as expected, but far from a total disaster
What ruined a nice night and dinner was the atmosphere in the restaurant
The waiters did their best in being polite and smiling, but with managers who were constantly on their back with messages FOR THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT, thing had to go wrong
Trying to find out why and what was happening I was told that the owner of the place was the one making life hard for his employees, and thus for the customers
When then asking the owner if he could keep his voice down, he didn't respond- but continues his harassment
We finished our mediocre meal and left the place as soon as we could
A glass of wine at the nearby Pink Pony was our rescue for the night!
Even though some reviewers have complained of having better wine in a bigger glass for less money, I suppose if a person had enough knowledge of wine, like the members of the staff at Cafe Charbon, they would realize that certain wines belong in certain glasses
Otherwise, this is a great place to celebrate Nouveaux Beaujolais along with other wine lovers and even some francophones! The staff knows well when a couple would rather have a romantic meal together without an intrusion, and the food is great
Overall, this is a wonderful establishment
My bf and I went to dinner on a cold rainy Tuesday evening
I was hoping for a warm cozy atmostphere and what we got was hard wooden chairs tiled kitchen floor hidden by the fact that the place is only lit by a few candles on the tables
The food was OK, but I could have had pasta with tomatoes anywhere
Not much variety for vegetarians
My Chardonnay was OK but I have had better in a much bigger glass for less $$
The waiters were dressed in jeans and t-shirts and seemed to get irritated when the place started to fill up
We may have gone on a bad night, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon
The decor in this place is great
The entrance, the bar area and the dining room all have very unique and well-done decor
The night that I went, it seemed very busy
This, teamed with an impatient and unattentive waitress (odd combination) made the service lackluster
The food was decent, but not great (possibly because of how busy they were)
The food was excellent, but the band was better
We'll go back every Wednesday night to hear the jazz band
I was eager to check out Epicerie Cafe Charbon, esp
having checked out the Cafe Charbon in Paris
At dinner on a Saturday night, I was enthused by the bustling, unpretentious crowd and the lusciously warm lighting
The menus were scrawled on blackboards a la Parisien and the food was quite decent (the duck was a little dry)
Perhaps the best part of it was feeling like you were in two places at once - in a cafe-restaurant in Paris but looking out the window onto the corner of Orchard and Stanton!
Good Bad - our meal was tasty, staff was somewhat inexperienced but nonetheless helpful
Major complaint was that our credit card was charged twice for the meal (the 2nd charge mysteriously showing up months later)
A polite call to the manager, who told us we weren't the only ones in this predicament, has yet to result in a credit despite the promise to fix it immediately
Hmmmm
sounds shady to me
What a combination! I've had numerous delicious dinners at Epicerie and thoroughly enjoy the super-fresh, ever-changing menu
And what a better neighbor than Cafe Charbon
This dimly-lit, very chill gem of a bar is a great place to grab a cocktail or yummy pint of imported Belgian beer - and they have great music to boot!
went on a noisy friday evening without reservations but it was well worth the short wait
great value french wine and selection

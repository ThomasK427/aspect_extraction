Likely to please most everyone, locals, visitors, finicky eaters, big eaters
Clubby feel with banquettes, photos of the streets from years ago
I had dinner with my husband this evening here and it was such a pleasure to be taken care of, and taken care of well
The waiter, Sean knew exactly what to do and was unobtrusive
The T-Bone for 2 was one of the top 3 I have ever had and the creamed spinach was by afr the best I have had
the ceasar salad was amazing
Try the garlic mashed as well!
The Scene Veselka's 24-hour kitchen is a magnet for East Village night owls looking to fill their stomachs before heading to bed
Solitary diners get comfortable at the counter, while eclectic groups fill up the tables in the large rear section, which is served by a largely Eastern European waitstaff
Bright lighting--the better to view the sprawling diner-themed mural by a longtime patron by--keeps everyone awake
The Food Polish and Ukrainian dishes such as pierogis and kielbasa share counter space with standard diner breakfast and dinner fare, including challah French toast and a hearty cheddar-topped chili
Raspberry blintzes--filled with sweet cheese and topped with homemade raspberry sauce--satisfy a dinnertime sweet tooth, while hot borscht with beef makes a pleasing winter dish
Chilled summer soups and year-round homemade pies are a bonus
This place is one of my favorites and I have brought many friends there
None of whom were less than thrilled
Great pirogies, the best I have ever had this side of Poland
It's fairly popular so be prepared for a wait at peak times
Open 24 hours and a real New York feel to it
Service is good in general sometimes great depending on whom you get
I have never ordered anything I was not happy with, all homemade and place is clean
Great value for the money
Can't go wrong
I'll admit it:  The food is pretty good
in fact, when I moved to the neighborhood, I found myself ordering from Veselka several times per week
ordered the same thing every time: chicken salad, chicken noodle soup, a soda
Three times the order was incorrect when I got to my home
today was the last straw: called and ordered the same thing as always, had them put it on my credit card they had on file, got my delivery and discovered they sent me potato salad instead of chicken salad
I called to ask for the chicken salad, and the order-taker argued with me, saying I ordered potato salad for dinner, not chicken salad
He finally said he'd send it over, then called me back 20 minutes later saying that they couldn't send it because they were too busy
He also said AGAIN that I ordered potato salad
He was so nasty and rude and unhelpful that I decided on the spot that I'd never go there OR order from there again
Veselka: the customer is always right
Keep that in mind so you stop losing customers due to rude service and stupid mistakes
Finally, a place that makes pierogi and holupki like my Baba used to make! Everything was delicious
The borscht was top notch, the kielbasa was lean, and the fruit was very fresh
For dessert, both the cheese blintzes and the kutya were delightful
There are a variety of sampler plates available to those who want to try everything (including a vegetarian plate), but there are also traditional diner dishes on the menu as well
It's a great place to go to for Sunday brunch
They do have the regular breaka stuff but come here for the Eastern European fare
The pierogies are melt-in-your-mouth, but better boiled than fried
I'm not crazy about blintzes but my boyfriend swears by them and I see they are very popular here
Great fresh squeezed juice too
I plan to dig into some borscht, meatloaf and stuffed cabbage next time
Save room for dessert- the baked chocolate custard is addictive
Its always crowded (for good reason!) so you may have to wait 15-20mins
When you need that something comforting at midnight, this is the place - yeah the service is a little slow, but sometimes I LIKE that!
Good: old school Ukranian borscht, chicken soup, pork and beef meatloaf, potatoes, plain dip in your soup sweet bread, poppy cake, kutya, fresh lemonade
Not so much: overdone potato pancakes fried in old grease
Service was very good, but we sat at the counter
Not much of an atmosphere, but what do you expect?
How good are their potato pancakes with sour cream, and applesauce? At 4am on Friday night, I walked from 10th Ave to 2nd Ave in stilettos to get them
'Nuff said
Went here today and the service was hideous! Usually spot on with food, service and prices, but our waitress was terrible! She was rude and nasty and disappeared for the longest time
we waited for over a half hour while she chatted and gossiped with her little buddies in order to get our check! Needless to say, no tip!
My boyfriend and I ate brunch here on Easter and although we did have to wait 45 mins
, the service was prompt and friendly
The porogies were amazing, especially the spinich and cheese
The kielbasa, the potato pancakes, the coffee, all hit the spot
And our whole easter brunch only cost us about $40
We will definitely be back to Veselka soon!
Veselka is a quality diner and serves up fairly authentic Ukranian grub
My hunter's stew--chicken, sausage, and saukraute were good, as was the mushroom and barley soup; my friends' pierogies were also quality
This place is comfortable and has a homey feeling
And as a bonus, open 24/7
excellent deserts, great atmosphere - great place to stay for a while and people watch
Really good pasteries and the service was fast and couteous
Only problem is that the wait was long but definitely worth it! Even though they were crowded we were not rushed
always a classic place to go with out of town guests or friends
busy but in a fun way
i love this place-one of my absolute favorites!
Velselka has really good pierogies
The rest of their food is standard diner fare
If you are hungry and you want polish accented diner food then go here
Definitely not a place to eat if you are looking for any more than that
Service is also really slow and semi unattentive
you must get the meatballs!!! i'm not even a fan of meat, but they were delicious
unlimited coffee refills
but beware of the staff
some are very moody and ignore you until it's time to tip them
I visited Veselka seven times during a three week visit to New York and never left dissatisfied
The service was very good though they tended to be a little slow with the check
On the other hand, I never felt rushed to vacate the place at the end of my meal
Sit near the back and enjoy the wonderful original mural painted on the back walls
I was only a little disappointed in the stuffed cabbage and pierogies but only because the Ukrainian recipes were somewhat different than the Croatian/Slovak recipes I grew up with
The borscht and split pea soups were outstanding, as was Ola's veal goulash
The raspberry blintzes alone were worth the ten hour flight from my end of the rainbow in Honolulu to the other end, Veselka (rainbow), in the East Village
For the tourist: this is a fascinating, dynamic and safe neighborhood
The best place for hot soup on a cold day, great pierogies and borscht
Be sure to visit J
Bacynsky's across the street for Babka afterward
If you are Eastern Eurpoean, Ukranian, and so on, this place will bring you back to time when grandma was rolling out the pierogi dough in her kitchen and frying the onions in tons of butter
I usually come in the colder months for takeout soup (try the mushroom barley) after paying a visit to the butcher across the street for some kielbasa, but last night some friends and I hopped in a cab late night, some 40 blocks to get some cold borscht, blintzes, pierogis, and stuffed cabbage
What a treat! Tourists you say? I think not, maybe you are thinking of the 2nd Avenue Deli
All I saw here were LESiders enjoying some great food
The great thing about NYC is that there are so many restaurants that you only have to visit the bad ones once
Not that Veselka is horrible, it is just VERY average
Unfortunately it poses as a far above-average spot and people are being fooled
Watch the lines on any given weekend
The food is only mediocre at best
The coffee is atrocious

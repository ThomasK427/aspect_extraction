Service could be better, especially when the place is packed
It's difficult to tell who's on line to order chocolates or barista drinks
The service was efficient but not friendly - fine, par for the course in NYC
I had a liquid chocolate (disgusting and I will consume any form of chocolate) and my boyfriend had an iced pear tea
The tea would have been fine if he'd bothered to sweeten it (totally his fault but the store was jammers)
I had a mint chocolate candy and it made up for the awful hot chocolate
I'd only go again for the candies
An on otherwise uneventful Sunday afternoon, a friend and I set out to put the City's so-called hot-chocolate hot spot to the test
The headed to the Chocolate Bar where we purchased, overpriced, over-rated hot chocolate
I sampled the white chocolate caramel, my friend stuck with the traditional
As the cold weather whipped our faces, the unimpressive taste of steamed milk and vanilla powder filled my mouth
My friend described the traditional hot chocolate as a $
05 bar of melted chocolate in a cup
The concoction was thrown away a mere two blocks from the Bar
I'll take Swiss Miss over the Chocolate Bar any day
P
S
- the vanillla chocolate tea tastes like BARK
in addition to yummy chocolate goodies, this place has the BEST chocolate boy/chocolate girl accessories
t-shirts, mugs, and little journals! illy espresso and hot chocolate done right
just the place to get your sugar fix and a little magic potion to heal whatever is ailing
Once you try the bon bons at Chocolate Bar, you will never want to eat Hershy's again! All the way to service, confections, ambiance, bar, etc
everything was perfect
All chocolate stores should be exactly this way
KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK CHOCOLATE BAR! PS: Those girls behind the counter are hot
Chocolate Bar is truly masterful at creating retro chocolates in a fab enviornment
The packaging is sharp and the shop is a gem that has any real chocoholic rejoicing! After i reading about them in the NY Daily News when they got picked as the #1 chocolate store in New York, I bought a box for Valentines
How do I know their chocolates are sooo good? She said yes!!!
I want to give this place an outstanding review
I really do
The place is small but feels open and airy, the employees were friendly, the vibe overall was just very laid back
Also, their liquid chocolate is amazing
HOWEVER, for $3
50 you'd think it would have a bit more chocolate and a bit less ice
Seriously, it took me all of 30 seconds to finish the drink, and not because I was drinking all that fast
It should have been called a sample of liquid chocolate
So I don't really think you get your money's worth in that respect, but I do plan on going back to get some of those chocolates
Overall, nice for a treat once in a while; if they'd offer a bit more value for their prices I definitely see myself addicted to the liquid chocolate
Lots of people have attested to how good the chocolate, brownies, cookies and beverges are at Chocolate Bar and I agree with all of them
I also think the store treats their customers better than any other well known, high-end shoppe in NYC
Some examples: Chocolate Bar is extremely loyal to their customers
They've thrown 2 huge tasting events over the past year, both FREE! I've probably eaten dessert there 20-25 times over this time
After you go there a few times, you notice they start to look out for you
Service is always kind but the owners tend to comp
That's not bad business, that's taking care of people who support your business
I wish I could find more dessert venues in the city that supported regulars the way Chocolate Bar does
Keep up the great work Chocolate Bar! You make New York special
Chocolate Bar is a scrumptious slice of chocolate paradise! Not your typical French bon bob shop
This is your wildest dream come true
Try black and whites and you've died and gone to heaven
This joint is a perfect 10!
seriously the best chocolate I've ever tasted! and although the workers fawned over me, all I could focus on was the chocolate
but be prepared, this place is always packed!
Mmm, Mmm Good! Visited NYC (direct from Studio, CIty California) and tried the peanut butter cup and it was scumpt-diddily-umptious! Came back the next day to try the new mint bar (employee recommendation, I've never had a mint bar before) ended up buy 12 for the folks at home
Saw the reviews, caught the store on the Food Network a couple of times and decided to give it a try
Guess what? I agree! Chocolate Bar is the best new dessert store as stated in 2003 Best of New York
Went to the tasty Chocolate Bar press conference and The Chocolate Bar enlisted the help of its bestseller?chocolate?to lure media to Eugene
A Bonanza of sweets were offered, and the sampling started early
Girls wearing orange Chocolate Girl T-shirts passed samples while store owners Matt Lewis and Alison Nelson discussed their new offerings of six outrageous flavors of chocolate bars being manufactured by New York chocolatiers Jacques Torres and Garrison Confections
Chef Ilene Shane introduced a signature treat that she makes for the store?chocolate-dipped s'mores that rocked my world
I've never seen so many press names dropped for reviews in my life
Who ever is this store's publicity: stop trying so hard
Twice I've been here, once for a gift and the second for myself
Mediocre service, mediocre chocolates
Overpriced for what you get
I'd go somewhere else
The NY Daily News chose Chocolate Bar's Love Box as the winner in a blind taste test and declared the confections the sweetest of the sweet
Ten Valentine samplers were critiqued for presentation and taste by four top pastry chefs who rated the competition
Chocolate Bar beat out such world-renowned chocolatiers as MarieBelle, La Maison du Chocolat, Jacque Torres, Godiva, Teuscher, Li-Lac, El Eden and more!
My boyfriend is a huge chocolate fan and when I read the review in Travel Leisure magazine about a new Chocolate Bar in Manhattan, I had to venture out to see for myself
We went as an after dinner treat and enjoyed every minute
My boyfriend especially enjoyed the postcard style cards on the counter that he could send to friends and family abroad to let them know--hey, look what you're missing out on! Desserts were delicious and the latte was just perfect! Only recommendation would be to have more seating, but I suppose you can't have too much of a good thing--even if it is chocolate!
A friend of mine and I popped in here to get a box of chocolate for a cocktail party we were going to
Oh man, was that ever a good idea! The chocolate is really beautiful and unique looking, and man is it yummy! I highly suggest the hazelnut milk chocolate squares - really darn yummy!  Aesthetically speaking, this little shop reminded me of London since there is a strong attention to simple, yet bright colored design in both the restaurant and the packaging
A big plus is that it's open until 10 pm, so you can definitely pop in there to get some chocolate after a local meal
Also, the people behind the counter are as sweet as the chocolate!
Read their review in the Post
The brownies are the best in the city, and the espresso was first class
I didn't have a chance to try the chocolates, but they were beautifully decorated
Will have to try on my next trip
The staff was pleasant and the vibe is great for a quick after-dinner indulgence
My friend had the spicy hot chocolate and raved
Just like the New York Times said; For those with a craving, a most chocolatey spot! Spicy brownies, fat cookies, chocolate clusters with either peanut butter or strawberry shortcake centers, dessert sauces, truffle lollipops, chocolate bars and assorted truffles fill the shelves at the bright new Chocolate Bar
They carry only the work of New York bakers and chocolatiers, including Jacques Torres, Garrison Confections, Sweet Bliss and Lunchbox
The shop also sells out-of-this-world coffee, iced chocolate drinks and chocolate-flavored teas
Chocolate Bar is yummy! It's a cute little shop with all kinds of chocolate from cookies to truffles to drinks
I liked the classic hot chocolate best
The staff is super nice and attentive and even answered all of my sister's one million questions
I suggest Chocolate Bar to anyone who likes Chocolate
You're sure to find something here you like
Read about this place in Lucky
The staff was well-informed and the selection was great
I loved the brownies--truly fudge-like
But the real find was the coffee
Starbucks no more
This stuff is GOOD
For those who can never have enough chocolate, the Chocolate Bar offers fresh temptation
90% of the fare is chocolate, and the remainder is chosen to go with chocolate
Jacques Torres' and Andrew Shutts' truffles and chocolate bars, chocolate biscotti ($2
25), chocolate-chip muffins ($2), chocolate truffle lollipops ($3

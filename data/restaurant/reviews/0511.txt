please fight the corporate urge
The food here is so great
We started off with the flat breads
Excellent
Then the Brooklyn Caviar with eggplant, peppers, anchovies
unbelievable
Our group shared the the large garden salad
The salad dressing is the best I've ever had
The grilled chicken panini with tomato and melted goat cheese
never had anything like it
Such fresh ingredients
We also had two brick oven pizzas, the four cheese with goat cheese shavings, yum! And also a tomato, mozarella, and fresh basil pizza
A simple piece of choclate cake for dessert
One of the best secrets in the city! GGOOO!!!
after dining at B
O
G over twenty times now, its official ! not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere
consistantly great thin crisp crust , inventive topping combinations and the smokiness from what is believed to be one New Yorks oldest wood burning ovens
like in Naples only wood is used  for Pizza! as for the rest of the menu , this is much more than a pizza place
offering such creative dishes like prosciutto sushi
brooklyn caviar and brick oven shrimp
the salads are huge and well made and the pasta's are not the normanl red sauced slop you recieve at other pizza houses
brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere
- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad
It was good, but was not what I thought it would be
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato (with espresso), which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced
- overall, if you are openminded, I recommend it
the tomato sauce on the pizza is a bit sweet and adds a unique touch
I never had anything I didn't like here
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza
Plenty of choices to make your own creation
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats
Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family
We visit at least once a month
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza
Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast
If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!
This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC
Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants)
I've been many time and have never been disappointed
I heard much hype about this brick oven pizza place and finally got a chance to go there on a wam summer night
The staff is friendly, and the food is yummy
They have many eccentric topping for their soft crusted and spicy red sauce pizzas, vairety of salads and apps plus pastas and panini's
What is better than going to an unpretentious place in Williamsburg where you can look at local artists displaying their art
In Short Tucked around the corner from a nail salon on Park Slope's main drag, this inconspicuous eatery specializes in catering and delivery
Since the wall-papered, kitchen-cozy room has but a few tables, most customers get food to go or place a delivery order from home
The menu might best be described as world cuisine with a higher consciousness: Hungry diners will find organic crab cakes, salads made with tempeh bacon and vegan fudge brownies
I once wrote a review before about how much I loved this restaurant
But a recent order left me disappointed
Usually the portions are plentiful, so that a $7
95 sandwich could make two meals
But my recent order of the blackened catfish po'boy was sub-par--there was hardly any fish on it, hardly any jalapeno tartar
The bulk of the sandwich was the lettuce and tomato, and if I wanted that, I'd certainly not pay $7
95 for it
Don't let me down, Second Helpings
Don't lose me as an advocate of your place!
The ceasar salad is FANTASTIC and a must every time we go there (or order in)
The dressing is their own and the lettuce is incredibly fresh
All the ingredients are fresh and care is taken in preparation for your orders
That said, service is sometimes slower than you'd like it to be, but if you're out with friends and enjoying some wine and music, you're not going to mind too much
The place is small and gets very crowded, especially on Friday and Saturday nights
be prepared to wait
Homemade pastas, fresh seafood, and great pizzas
You won't be disappointed!!
the pizza's decent enough, but it's not worth the agony of dealing with the person taking the orders (his english isn't up to par and half the time he gets our address wrong), or the defeat of receiving a stone cold pizza
there are better delivery pizza places in queens, go elsewhere!
I absolutely love this place
Easily the best food I've had since moving to this neighborhood
The pizzas are excellent and served fast
In particular, the sausage pizza is absolutely outstanding
Chicken is excellent as well
The standard Italian cuisine is above average but not as superb as the pizza (although still worth ordering -- the Penne ala Vodka which chicken is very good)
Highly, highly recommended to anyone in the area looking for good pizza
The pizza is all delicious, however, their stuffed garlic knots are to die for
Pasta dishes are excellent as well
Their delivery people are johnny on the spot
Come to Queens!
I've been living in the neighborhood for years, but only recently made my way to Sage--it's on a stretch of Jackson Ave where most people have no reason to be, between Citibank and Queens Plaza
But I have to say it's worth going a few blocks out of your way
this little shop does simple, interesting American food, really well
The sandwiches are awesome (I especially love the Grilled Chicken Breast, with blue cheese and roasted red peppers and watercress
yum), the soups are hearty and delicious, and the baked goods
I'll go WAY out of my way for one of their German Chocolate Brownies
Although with the opening of the Sculpture Center and MOMA nearby, and PS1 just a few blocks down Jackson (with a mini-Sage of its own for the cafe), maybe this isn't so out of the way after all
I stumbled accross this wonderful little cafe on my way to PS1
What a breath of fresh air in the middle of this industrial wasteland
Amazing sandwiches and salads delicious homemade desserts and the best cup of coffee I have had in a long time
A definate stop off on your way to PS1 or the new sculpture center on purvis st
If u want soemthing inexpensive and tasty
this is the way to go
Great soft tacos and guacomole
Shrimps were a bit overcooked
The big entrees are average but the cheap food is spectacular! The Tortas mejicanas which is like a sandwich with beans, jalapenos, your choice of meat, lettuce and tomato, and onions are really savory
Excellent guacamole, fajitas pretty much everything
Found this by accident and glad i did! Actually i'm going there right now
love it
only complaint is that they could use more help

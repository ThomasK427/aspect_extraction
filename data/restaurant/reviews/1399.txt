The dlicieux menu is reasonably priced and the atmosphere is trs confortable
I especially love the French newspaper articles and advertisements that wallpaper the bathroom
Very nice attention to detail
Lot of character, no upturned noses
I expected Le French Diner to have only sandwiches based on an article I read
To my surprise it had an extensive menu
They have added much since
Although it's very laid back, Zucco has class
I showed up with a wine-connaisseur/trader that enjoys dining at BYOB spots
We took seats at the bar with 2 amazing bottles of wine (one for the appetizers and one to match the entrees) Monsieur Zucco was very accomodating and kept a sharp eye at filling our glasses at the right time at the right level
Get a seat away from the door if possible so you don't get cold
I love the slightly morbid, dark, ex-patriot vibe of the place
In my dreams, when I get lost in a bad section of Paris, I turn a corner to find a diner with comfort food just like Zucco
This former coffee shop (Angelina's) has been revamped into a cute French bistro
The food is tremendous and the owner, Zucco, is a charming host
I almost didn't want to review this because its such a great place and is quite small (15 seats or so)
I live on Orchard and it's a great addition to the neighborhood
And right now Zucco doesn't have a liquor licensce so you can BYOB while you dine on warm french bread, duck confit and creme brulee
Ok, I have to go on a liitle rant about this place
I consider myself a seasoned foodie and a pretty jaded customer when it comes to Hot Spots in the city
That being said , let me state for the record that LOFT is by far the most gorgeous restaurant I've seen in ages
They have this zen tropical garden outside that sets the tone right away and the inside boasts tons of candles, plants ( even a tree inside), buddah heads and super cool balinesian stamps on the walls
The whole place just seems like an oasis and the food is crazy good
I was just blown away by the whole experience as was my boyfriend
The chef came out and spoke with us ( I'm lactose intollerent) about some suitable selections for me and the bartender made us strawberry/ ginger martinis that went down too easy!!! They had a really nice crowd of young fun patrons and it felt more like we were downtown then in our conservative hood
In a word it was SUBLIME
We made ressies for the next weekend as we were leaving
You gotta go!! leaving
I am not trying to be rude; the only way to put it-this place is terrible
Its overprice, the service is non-existent, and unless you enjoy licking a block a salt the food is horrible
I brought my wife to the Loft to celebrate her birthday, we both got a Mimosa, shared the chicken egg roll appetizer, and both ordered the Mediterranean salad
The mimosa was sour
The egg rolls were bland
The salad was salty; and was so small it could literally fit in the palm of your hand
It consisted of two pieces of shrimp that was cut in half to look like four pieces of shrimp, two cherry tomatoes that were cut in half to look like four cherry tomatoes and 1/8 of an avocado fanned out to take up some plate space and finally the one piece of crumble Gorgonzola cheese to add the Italian feel to the plate
This salad will run you $18 and one hell of a time getting a refill of water cause your lips dried out from all the salt added to the dressing
We had to wait 40 minutes to finally get our bill so we could get the hell out of there and get a slice of pizza for lunch
I am not going to repeat what the guy below this review said about the management, but its true
I had the pleasure of arguing with the female manager
All she could do was tell me how she was sorry that her restaurant sucked and that I was stuck with the bill I received
Please, do not be a moron and eat at this restaurant like I did
Save your $75 +tip that you will spend here for lunch and buy your wife a slice of pizza down the street
She will thank you
I went to Loft tonight for dinner w/ reservations for myself and 6 friends
We were promptly seated and thats about the only good thing from our dinner that night
The food took forever to come out and when it did, two of the chicken tagine dishes were shockingly small, there was no chicken, just skin and bones
My friend's vegetarian dish was ridiculously small
You could have stuffed his entire entree into a shot glass
At the end of the meal, my friend politely explained to the waiter and manager that his dish was disappointing and maybe to take that into consideration for the future
The manager seemed not to care and then proceeded to give us our full bill with the 20% added tip
My friend then spoke to him again, he gave an attitude
Finally, we were leaving and my friend once again approached the manager and simply spoke about the food and unfair service needing some improvement or people won't come back
His response, Well, it depends which people I want to come back
I am SHOCKED at this response from a fancy UWS restuarant
Aside from that awful experience, the food portions are EXTREMELY small, the wait is long
The ONLY good thing about Loft, is the decor which I must admit was nice to look at
But STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTUARANT at all costs!!!
Savory, spicy, stimulating, stupendous, scintilating, SUPER! One of the best meals I have ever enjoyed,and one of the nicest experiences to be had in our neighborhood
What a welcome addition, it's just what this area needs, actually what any area needs
Watch out for the modern portions though, make sure you order enough!
The atmosphere of this spacious yet cozy UWS restaurant maybe right out of the Village, but the service is awful
When I presented a coupon advertised above, I was virtually laughed at in front of my two guests
NOT RECOMMENDED
I don't know what this guy's below me problem is
The many times I've dined at Loft, if there's ever a problem with food, the staff was more than happy to take it back and have the chef fix whatever was wrong with the dish or bring a brand new dish out
This restaurant is not afraid of admitting to their mistakes and making sure you are happy
They either threw on complimentary drinks or taken something off the bill
I think that's terffic
The staff is wonderful and extremely helpful
They know their menu very well and if they don't, they always consult the chef
Although the menu has changed drastically, the quality of the food is impeccable
I love the diversity of the staff, not only are they all stunning, they speak a variety of different languages
Well not that it matters I guess, but just the overall ambiance is terrific
The people are great, the decour is simply stunning and the food is terrific
Enjoy!
If you are looking for a good meal, avoid this property
While the decor and the atmosphere are ideal for drinks, if you are looking for a pleasurable dining experience with good food, do not bother
Service is unattentive and the food is spotty, only some dishes are edible
One fish dish was bloody and the other dish entirely bland
Me and my girlfriends have been regulars at Loft since their opening
Although the food has always been decent, we were mainly drawn by the scene and the hot waiters/ bartenders
Much to our suprise last Saturday's experience was superb
The notoriously bad service was actually on point and the food was out of this world (they just signed on some celebrity chef)
You should definitely experience the new and improved Loft, it rocks!
Loft is one of those spots where they have the mojo woking overtime
This place is on point from the moment you step in the door
Our group arrived 30 minutes late ,the hostess was super cool and worked out a table for us in no time
We were sat underneath an olive tree (growing inside!!!) that had all these gorgeous lanterns hanging from it , and we all felt like VIP's
The chef came out and gave us these tasty little tuna rolls and made some suggestions for ordering
Our waitress was very attentive and explained patiently to everyone questions on the menu
A dj started playing out of nowhere and after an amazing dinner we actually had a spin on the downstairs dance floor
It was an awesome night and even more so because it was so unexpected
Simply put, we loved loft
Could not believe when I stumbled upon this ridiculously cool restaurant/lounge in my normally blah neighborhood
My girlfriend and I got a table with no ressie even though the space was packed, plus number 1
We were sat in a downstairs lowlit lounge with cool carpets and boodah heads, and had a pre-dinner strawberry ginger mojito, plus number 2
Then our waiter took the lead and ordered for us, and I can honestly say it was one of the best dinners we've ever had
The food was over the top and the whole sensory expierience was just to die for
LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT
Stopped by Loft for late night supper with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised by the super accommodating (and super cute) staff

So we go and the place was PACKED with cuties
Better yet the tuna was AWESOME
Better yet my waiter was absolutely adorable with the cutest accent
Great wine , great food!
Came into a very crowded room - was quoted a 20 minute wait so I bellied up to the bar- great bartender with great wine suggestions!- sweet hostess came got us had an outrageous Steak Frites and eggs! Good deal!
I went there for brunch, I hated this place : Incompetent service, cold food (even if I dont think it could have been better warm), flat soda
The only plus is the terrace
was there on a thursday night, place was packed and full of hot chics, had a great steak! cote for 2 for myself and my buddy had the lamb special
the meal was great! cheap, and the place was lots of fun! filled with a bunch of cool people!
We have been to this restaurant before and were surprised at the low rating it received and decided to revisit
Our favorite dish at Steak Frites is not steak, but mussels and fries
A glass of wine and some french bread for dunking, and a large bowl of fragrant steaming mussels - voila!
I consider myself somewhat of an amateur steak expert, and have been in search for a good steak for a decent price in NYC
My wife and I had been putting off Steak Frites because of the mediocre reviews
We were very pleasantly surprised to find that the steaks were excellent and the price was good (for the Union Sq area)
On Tuesday night, we were seated immediately w/o a reservation
The waitress was prompt and helpful, something that has become rare in the area
Overall: high recommendation for Steak Frites
my food wasnt good
It hadnt much taste
Maybe next time I will order the steak frites, hopefully good, since they named the joint after it!
If you like food, then you will hate this place
I can tolerate incompetent service for a great meal, but neither is offered here
Send people you don't like here
Never returning
Mr
HardAssDrunk has always been under the impression that this place is staffed by young, inexperienced, incompetent interns
Maybe it is, I dunno
Anyway, get over that, and enjoy the great steaks
I have been comming here on and off since the very early 90's and most of the time I find their rare steak frites to usually be one of the best tasting steaks in the city - better than Mortons, Sparks, etc
etc
I say usually, because, once in awhile, they fire off a dud - a cold undone piece of leather or worse, bits of steak held together with superglue-ish gristle
Anyway, if you want better service, go next door, but better make sure you wallet can handle it
Come here if you want relaxed, relatively inexpensive, fine bistro food and drink, served by good looking hard working but incompetent staffers
I seldom go out on Saturday night for dinner and doing so this past weekend reminded me why
We arrived at 9PM and after waiting 10 minutes with out a visit from our waiter, I went and found him
The whole evening was filled with missing forks, no bread, water glasses that went unfilled, main courses arriving while people were still eating their appetizer, and (believe it or not) all main courses arrived ice cold and all were sent back
MacDonald's runs their establishments better
As for the food? It's good with reasonable prices
Mussels and fries are very good
Lamb was tough
Onion soup flavorful and deserts elegant
The room is also pleasing with air between tables
The Scene Cheetah-print banquettes, bamboo lanterns and a few elements of '60s kitsch and Southwestern decor are thrown together for just enough of a jumbled theme to make this East Village nook look festive and fun
An evening here is more pleasant than mind-blowing
For fun on the run, sip a mojito at the bar while a portrait of the Virgin Mary bizarrely watches over you
The Food Lines stretch out the door for pungent sangria and a decent meal that kicks off with fried plantain chips and a great garlicky black-bean dip
Highlights of the budget-friendly, Brazilian-influenced menu include roast pork, coconut shrimp and peppy frozen drinks served tall and strong in classic milkshake glasses
We spent $40 a piece here
The dinner was really good, but that is somewhat pricey for the Lower East Side
The big expense was the great Xingu Beer at $6
50 a pop
The spicy shrimp was a welcome change in a city full of food wimps
All the dishes were delicious, and the staff was really accommodating of our rearranging the furniture as we grew
Dessert? The pineapple with rum sauce! Come before 7 if you want to be sure of a seat
Yowsah! --Eat club is a roving group of NYC gluttons
When my boyfriend and I were going on our first date I went on citysearch to find a good inexpensive date spot
I chose Boca Chica and I am so happy I did
The place is very small and but also very colorful and festive
The food is authentic and DELICIOUS
My boyfriend is not very adventurous when it comes to food but he loved the Arroz con Pollo and even ate some of my Ropa Vieja
This is not a trendy hopping bar the attitude of the place is that more of a cafe than a restaurant but it is very good food for a very good price and the decor puts you in a great mood
Plus if you want to check out the bar scene afterwards it is in a great location
There are probably six tables and one booth in the entire place but the staff does not rush you out, Try the Flan and the white sangria- both delicious! My boyfriend and I have been together over a year now and he still suggests Boca Chica everytime we plan to go out to eat
I love this place
I've been here lots of time and try to bring anyone who hasn't tried it
The food is fresh, flavorful and delicious
I don't know how else to describe it
It's a bar/restaurant, so it's loud music, crowded around the bar
Free plaintains and bean dip fills you up, so don't indulge
Their drinks are great and service is quick
I have literally dreamt about the food here!!! Everything is delicious!! Ivan, the bartender, is great! The atmosphere is always fun
It's a great place to take out-of-towners! Not expensive and portions are big
I LOVE LOVE LOVE BOCA CHICA!!! :)
This place is one of my favorites
The food is great
The fried plantains and dip they give you at the table are delicious and different
The drinks are REALLY strong
I cant help but order the Pastel de Choclo everytime, it's so good
The only thing is that it's tiny so a group of 2 is definitely best here
And the bar is small too, so waiting for a table can be uncomfortable
We celebrated a friends birthday there last night
We selected Boca Chica because there were so many bar/lounges within walking distant from it
Before hand we were told that they do not take reservations on Saturday nights and the wait could be around 1hour anytime after 8pm for large parties
We thought that was an inconvience but were told we could hang out at the bar and wait
When we got there we realized why they dont take reservations, the place is tiny
However we were seated pretty quickly
The food was enjoyable, the food was well seasoned and cooked and we had everything from coconut shrimp, steak and chicken
The sangria was kind of bland
They did bring out a piece of cake with a candle on it for my friend which was a cute added touch
Overall we enjoyed our time at Boca Chica
This place can get pretty busy, so I would suggest making reservations
We had to wait about 45min-1h before we were seated, but they were kind enough to give us any one appetizer from the menu on the house due to the long wait
The food (vegetarian non-vegetarian) was truly authentic as well as the drinks (alcoholic non-alcoholic)
The quantity is definitely more than average, so don't go with a full stomach
Also, unless you really can handle chilies don't order the shrimps with green chili sauce - I personally loved it
Since frequenting there I make sure and recommend this place to any one who ask me about a great spot
I loved it the first time and have not been able to say different yet
There mojitos are great!!
It's sometimes hard to find good latin food these days

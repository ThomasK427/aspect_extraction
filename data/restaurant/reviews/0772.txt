BUT space is small, and don't be surprise if you get to hear your neighbor's stories clearer than your date accross the table
Overall it's a soooo worth it experience :)
This place was not exactly the romantic, chill lair that I had imagined
Had dinner here on a Sat
night and bad 80s music was playing pretty loud - was not exactly condusive to fine wine and conversation
The menu is very small with only a few options
My cheese fondue and chicken were ok, but nothing to go back for
And apparently my friend had arrived early to ask the waitress to bring out a special surprise dessert for me, but she entirely forgot
Half the time she was MIA despite the fact that she only had 3 tables
Someone there told us the place is usually better on week nights, so heed this wisdom
We're in no hurry to go back
The pun is intended
The mixture of French Caribbean delicacies are to die for
Not only was it worth the wait but we waited at the local wine bar next door, Monkey Temple, which had a great vibe and we bought wine for our meal
Ivo Lulus staff was really attentive and made us feel at home
I love the pear appetizer, and mushroom soup, my fianc enjoys the duck and chicken, and any dessert is incredible
We work in midtown and live in Brooklyn and decided that this is the spot to become a regular
Bon a petit!
I must say that the food was delicious
We had a table of 5, and we tried most everything on the menu
I really like the scalloped potatoes and the mussels appetizers
I got the smoked duck for the entree which was really good
I think they might have raised the prices though, because most of the entrees were between 12 -14
And honestly, the serving sizes were VERY small (we got pizza afterwards)
We tried both desserts and were not impressed
So from a pure food standpoint although it all really tasted good, it isn't as cheap as the other reviews convey
However, I would definately go back because it's a BYOB
While the kitchen is about the size of a closet, the food that comes out of there is colossal
Nothing is over 10 dollars and and evry taste is unique
The food melts away the small restaurant and delivers you to a place that I call heaven
Did I mention BYOB?
I selfishly don't want to sing Ivo Lulu's praises because I want to keep this gem to myself, but really - this place is just wonderful
Ridiculously simple inexpensive, it is delicious and delightful
It is VERY close quarters, but it adds to the charm
The hosts are so sweet friendly, too
Bring wine and good company, it's simply marvelous
The food, service, and chef and owner Sebastian--just simply amazing
It's flavorful, spicy, just absolutely delicious
The duck and desserts cannot be missed
This is probably the best kept secret in New York
The food--from the tasty and creative appetizers to the finger-licking deserts--is spectacular
This is by far one of the best restaurants in the city--and the price cannot be beat
BYOB is an added plus, but I would frequent this place regardless
The service is great, and the vibe is warm and inviting
I went to Ivo Lulu's last night with a group of friends
read the reviews prior, and knew to Bring Our Own
we could not decide on what to order, so we ordered one of everything, it was not very extensive, but in fact, less is more, and it was so much more then I expected
Everything was spectacularly delicious and no one wanted to be done with their meal
It wasn't just food, it was an amazing explosion of flavors of savory, sweets and exotic textures all in one
I fell in love with the Coconut squash soup, the Coconut flan, and the host :) Mmmm
I can almost taste it now
There was not one unsatisfied customer at our table
We were eating in such slow motion
just to make it last longer
I truly believe it tastes so great because it's made with love
I'll definitely be a regular
After visiting friends' little neighborhood joints for years, I always thought, sure, it would be satisfying for me too if I went there every week and the owners got to know me
Well, I'd make you feel at home too if you dropped thousands of dollars at my restaurant
Here, you get that experience THE FIRST TIME you visit
I've always searched for the best food, rather than the best 'dining experience'
Now, I finally get what's so great about having a little place of your own
Food here is very tasty French-Carribean bistro fare, but it's almost besides the point
It's so satisfying that describing this place is futile
Bring your favorite wine
Soak it in
At $20 a head, you have nothing to lose
I don't know how they make money -- it would cost me as much to buy the ingredients and make these dishes at home
I have been here a couple of times and I love it
The staff makes you feel as though you are having a casual, delicious dinner at a friend's house
The menu is cheap and inventive
Plus, it's BYOB! I came here with a few friends, and we had the best time
Even though the place is small, the staff does not rush you out the door
You might have a wait a bit for a table, but there is a great bar next door (Monkey Temple), where the atmosphere is just as inviting, and makes the wait feel short
Went to Ivo and Lulu for dinner last night and the whole experience was fantastic
The space is small and they don't take reservations, but go next door to the bar while you wait and have some very yummy sakatini's that are made with fresh fruit
Try the mango
I'll definitely be going back
Thanks for a nice evening
There are far too many BYOB places in the city and many of them don't have food that shines
But Ivo and Lulu has delicious food (albeit a limited menu) and prices that are unbeatable
The owner is friendly and and space is cozy
Be prepared to wait if you don't get there early
Fab things about this place
We got there early so we avoided the wait, well worth it though! The staff was super friendly and the food was superb! I can't say enough about this place
It is so so so great!!!
I went on a weeknight with a friend
We were greeted immediately by the host and directed to the nearest wine shop (BYO!!!)
Even though there were a bunch of tables open, he still took our name before we left to purchase the wine, just in case the tables filled up while we were gone, which I thought was a nice gesture
The menu was small and consisted of 4 appetizers ($6-$8) and 4 entrees ($10)
The waitress was both friendly and helpful
We shared the mussels app, and I had the chicken stuffed with goat cheese, while my friend opted for the duck
Since everything was so inexpensive, especially with the money we'd saved w/the wine, we opted for both the dessert options that night which were the mango pudding and some kind of chocolate cake
Everything was fantastic
This is one of the best values out there
This place is perfection
Simple, organic meals, great service, intimate seating
There are few choices, almost a 'tasting menu' but each dish is impeccably prepared
The staff is concerned with your satisfaction, the price is right and candlelit dinner doesnt have to cost a fortune
You leave knowing you've done something good for your body and soul
Soon, there'll be a need to expand

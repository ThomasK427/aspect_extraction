Each time, the service was impeccable - not too interruptive but very attentive
The food options had good variety and I could always find a very healthy and tasty option
The fruit plate breakfast is a treat from the usual canteloupe and strawberries you get most places
The green tea a great blend from the T salon T emporium
yum! Don't worry, they also have great non-low-fat options like the classic eggs benedict
Mercer offers a choice of a private table, or seating at long dining tables, with other parties (ala wagamama in london)
The space is very hip, though very dark at this subterranean SoHo boutique hotel restaurant
The crowd is of course beautiful, but the staff is not that bad
Jean Georges's food is really good, and definately a lot better than most hip places, and there are a few good deals on the wine menu
Bottom line: you've passed by it so many times before, you have to go
Relatively good value considering the location and scene
The service great  the atmosphere wonderful and the food magnificent
The atmosphere was super trendy
The food was delicious
If I save up enough money, I'd definitely go back!
Sophisticated trendy
Good place to come and hang out before you go out
The Scene On the basement level of the Kitano Hotel, guests get a taste of Japanese culture
Hostesses draped in kimonos smile and bow as they lead guests to the main dining area or one of three private tatami rooms
Unflattering fluorescent lighting and less-than-luxurious furnishings make the space feel more fast food than fine cuisine, but the look is deceiving
The Food An a la carte menu offers specialties like Kobe beef cooked on a hot rock, but the Kaiseki, a traditional multicourse tasting dinner served on gorgeous pottery and porcelain, promises dining adventure
Choose tempura, steak, or impeccably fresh sushi as a main course, and let the chef select the rest
A dainty dish cradles creamy house-made tofu, a tiny hand-painted pot reveals a delicate egg custard, and a wicker stand displays a bowl of shaved ice topped with silky sashimi
Mango ice cream or coffee-flavored gelatin finishes the flavorful journey
Why are there fluorescent lights in this restaurant? I expect to see fluorescent lights in a college cafeteria, not in a $100 a person restaurant
The food is very good, but those lights must go
What were you thinking?  With some nice lighting, this restaurant could be romantic
We've been going to this restaurant at least once a month for over 5 years
We've brought our friends and familly and NO ONE was ever disappointed
Go and see for yourself, their double cut veal chop dish is a winner
The owner is there every night, if you don't like something, tell him, he fix it
I would recommend this restaurant if it were not so expensive
The prices will not break the bank, but the quality of the food simply did not live up to the price of the food
The dishes are also quite heavy, so make sure you go on an empty stomach
The staff are very friendly; top notch
Food was ok, but not worth the $90 tab for 2
There are much better places to eat in NYC for your $$
Restaurant was pretty much empty on a Friday night making for a very dull atmosphere
I won't go back
The Scene Very little about the decor suggests either Asia or Cuba: think billowy white curtains, handsome wood paneling, commodious banquettes, bursts of color and seductive lighting
But despite its modernity, Asia de Cuba captures a retro feeling that's warm and inviting
The focal point is a long, communal marble table set for 34, where solo diners meet and share colossal portions, cooing "your plate or mine?"  The Food On the whole, the Asian-Latin fusion food is well-seasoned and clean-tasting
The Thai beef salad, an artful combination of seared, thinly sliced beef topped with Asian greens, avocado, orange segments and crisp noodles sets the mouth ablaze with a fiery vinaigrette
Tunapica, tuna tartare mixed with Spanish olives, black currants and almonds is also strong
Was there this weekend for my big 30 with my bf and 2 other friends and ASIA DE CUBA was the perfect spot for us San Franciscans to celebrate! The service was EXCELLENT
Our waitress first ushered up upstairs to the bar which is beautifully lighted with great cocktails and beautiful people
Dinner downstairs can be had in the communal table in the middle or in private tables
Ours happened to be in a private booth/table
Food was delicious
tried some veggie stuff and the cuban spicy chicken
i can't remember the cocktails i had coz i was drunk but they were oh so good
i wanted a flirtini but forgot to order that
Lighting was great and it was just trendy enough, noisy enough without being too loud to have a great celebration
The dessert was an ice cream/strawberry/macadamia tart with a candle lit while my friends sang the usual Happy B'day tune
It was lovely! Defly worth checking out if you are from out of town since it's a NY experience!
A friend and I went to Asia de Cuba during Restaurant Week 2006, and I have to say that the food was amazing
I recommend the Grill BBQ Salmon
This place is a GO!! It may be a little pricy, but well worth it
And if you can make it for Restaurant Week, where they offer a pre-fixe menu, you should definitely take advantage ot it
There's nothing like a little asian in your latin dish
A group of us went to Asia de Cuba for dinner absolutely loved it! The food was fantastic, the service excellent - very friendly, knowledgeable, helpful staff, great ambiance and decor
We had stuffed fish with rice, mashed potatoes with lobster and ribs and appetizers (everything was delicious)
I also have a new favorite drink - champagne with raspberry vodka (yumm!)
For desert had coconut tart that was DELIC
with lots of caramel coconut ice-cream
The prices are a bit high, but it was definitely worth it
Great for parties too
Highly recommend
Took a client there for a dinner, food was great with large portions
the only problem i had was that it was too loud! Not a place to bring clients, but had drinks at the bar afterwards, and enjoyed ourselves
Asia de Cuba definitely lives up to it's reputation
The food, drinks (Sangria), and service are exceptional, not to mention the atmosphere
Go w/a small group or just 1 person, I would not recommend a large group
It is a bit pricey, but the portions are large enough to share
The only thing I would not recommend is the Pad Thai - stick w/your favorite Thai Restaurant for that
Our flight landed late so we called ADC and let them know we were running late
They were very nice about it, and I mentioned I understood and we are absolutely willing to have a drink at the bar
We finally get there and the place was gorgeous and still at a scene, even at 9:30pm
Everybody was very nice, accommodating, complimenting
from the host, bartender, server and busser, no matter how busy it was
It might help that we were two young ladies
The drinks were on point and the food was incredible
We had some sorta of kobe sashimi salad with coconut shavings which was phenomenol and a lobster ravioli
I could have passed the pad thai though, a little too light in taste and heavy in texture
We didn't even have room for dessert
Overall, we had a great night
Plus, it was better than LA's ADC
huuge portions, which made it much easier paying the $350 bill
nevertheless, had a great time, the calamari salad and duck? i cant remmeber the name was delicious
would definately go again
fantastic food! yes, expensive
however, the food is served family style so you and friends/family can enjoy several very unique and savory dishes
don't miss the pork dish and the coconut rice
try hitting the place for lunch - no crowds, fantastic service, and the opportunity to take your time and enjoy!
I heard so much about this place
I came to New york and wanted a nice romantic dinner with my boyfriend
The food was amazing and restaurant was beautiful but the table behind me had 3 little kids screaming and throwing food
If I am going to a nice place and paying $200-250 from my meal I would not like to have the TGIF kids behind me
They should try and not let young kids in there it kills the mood
Overall you should go I hope you have better luck then me if u want a romantic night

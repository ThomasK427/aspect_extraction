Tables don't turn over often
The food was a delicous change to the regural mom and pop restaurant
It's like dining in Manhattan, but you're in Brookyn close to home
The music takes you home
Man! everything about this restaurant is worth going and experiencing yourself
I would takemy hat off to the owners if I was a man
They really out done theirselves
I tell everyone I know about this restaurant
Thought they just started, I see expansion come for them in the future
They have a winner
Take time brooklynites Rome was builded in a day
But, I see this as our new hot spot
Overall, this is a nice addition to the neighborhood
The food is pretty decent and nicely presented
The drinks are great (although they had no red wine?) but the service does need some polishing
The service is slow and they brought us the wrong check but I definitely plan on going back
This place looks great and has very tasty food, however, the service is not up to par
My date and I waited patiently for a table and when we finally got one, our food took 30 minutes and when it arrived, they had gotten one of our orders wrong
They agreed to give us a round on the house - but only after we asked for it
Eating and drinking at Sugarcane is not cheap so in light of the delays and mistakes, I would have appreciated a little bit more effort from the staff and owner to make sure we were happy
Never again
Firstly, it took them close to an hour to get any food to us
The bus boy kept trying to take my coffee from me
They brought my food out TWENTY minutes after my dining companions'
The bill came and they had charged us for two drinks that were supposed to be complimentary
When the waittress went to correct the bill, she only took one drink off
as if we wouldn't notice
And to top it all off, the Jazz portion of the Jazz Brunch never played while we were there
I was willing to let a few things slide on account of them being new, but this was ridiculous
I am new in town so my friends took me to Sugarcane for Sunday brunch
I was greeted by a pleasant staff, a melodic jazz band, and very tasteful decor
The food is excellent, wonderful, home cooking served uptown style
If you miss the macaroni pie, shark, and oxtail then this is the place to go
The warm colors and cozy atmosphere will enhance any gastronomical and social pleasure
Great decor, tasty dishes, really good rum punch - and it's close to home, if you live in the area
If you don't, it's nice to eat someplace that is NOT in the city! It's worth a trip with friends!!!
There is a large selection of tasty drinks
Unique decor
I hear there is live music Sunday
I'll be back soon for that!
The Scene The restaurant, decorated in dark wood and cream, is cool and clean rather than warmly inviting; the blue light streaming from the bar area gives a faintly undersea feel
Service, catering to a midtown business crowd, is professionally suave, eager to please and unobtrusive
The Food The menu features inventive Italian seafood
A tender mussels-in-broth starter, redolent of garlic and tarragon, is excellent
Acqua pazza--a filleted Mediterranean fish-of-the-day, cooked whole with cherry tomatoes, white wine and seawater--is the house specialty
It's elegantly simple, though not as flavorful as some of the restaurant's other excellent dishes, such as grilled salmon with fennel, or yellowfin tuna with a potent balsamic reduction
The restaurant also offers several tasty, albeit skimpy, pasta dishes
Five scallop raviolis, served in a ravishing artichoke puree, are delicious, but don't merit their entree-sized price
Desserts, including a chocolate-passionfruit "duomo" and a rum baba, are uniformly excellent
Went to an early dinner here one night after work and found it to be an overall great experience
The service was attentive and the food was delicious
Definitely try it out for great fish and pasta dishes
My valentine's day was completely ruined by this restaurant
The place was extremely noisy and unromantic
Beyond that, the service was absolutely terrible
Between taking almost a half hour to take our order, not clearing dishes, forgetting our entree/dessert order, and spilling wine all over the table - it was a sure fire way to kill the Valentine's Day vibe
I feel horrible that my boyfriend spent all this money on a fancy meal just to leave the restaurant aggrivated
Steer clear
I rarely review restaurants unless I am so dazzled by the experience or, in this case, extremely disappointed
I started with a polenta appetizer
which might have been considered good had it not arrived cold
The waiter pointed out that the plate was very hot
It seems as though the plate spent more time on the heat than the polenta
For my main dish, I ordered a rolled veal stuffed with escarole and mozzarella in a creamy tomato sauce
Same problem
hot plate, uncooked food
The veal was RAW!!! I had to send the dish back TWICE and the second time they just replaced it with a mediocre veal scallopini dish
Not tasty, but at least the meat was cooked
One would think that they would have compensated and not charged for the uncooked raw food, but they did
I would definitely never return to this restaurant
The seafood was incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection! Portions are more European but lends the opportunity to have an appetizer, entree, and desert without feeling overstuffed
The staff was very knowledgeable and so attentive
An absolutely wonderful experience!
Great Food, great ambiance, great value

I have to agree with the last ratings
the food was pretty good but the portion was very small and I don't usually eat alot of food
The service was good but sometimes I just want to be left alone when I am dining with friends, they were constantly on top of us and taking away food without asking if we were done
Overall good restaurant but they have to make some changes
After reading the RAVE reviews below, I figured this place was a MUST-TRY
After trying it, I walked out of there thinking that all of these reviews must have been written by staff and management
The food wasn't bad but straight 10's??? No way
I will give the service a 10, but they need to beef up the portions, we had to order the cheese platter after dinner because we were still hungry!! Definitley not what I expected
One of the best dining experiences I've had in quite a while
Emphasis on seafood; the mussels are worth it just for the sauce
And you've never tasted mashed potatoes like these! We also had lamb, which was perfect
For dessert try the chocolate cake in orange coulis; creme brulee was also delicious
The wait staff are very accomodating without being intrusive
Lovely atmosphere
A special thank you to Michael for making our experience at Acqua Pazza such a memorable one
The food and ambiance are incredible! Great place to take clients for lunch, as the environment is conducive to great conversation!
Simply fantastic
The food was exquisite and the decor was marvelous
Definetly a romantic place for a date
Enjoy

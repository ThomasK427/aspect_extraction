Who are these people that live on the UES but have never been to Sassys? What is Sassys? Its White Castle, but better
They use much higher quality meat then white castle but only a little more per burger
Unlike Pop Burger, which I would describe as a regular hamburger just smaller, Sassys sells sliders
As with most sliders the soft and puffy bun makes up about 75% of the burger
Toppings include grilled unions and a pickle slice
At a Buck O Nine most people pick up at least 4
One of my favorite things about this place is that you dont have to get all the same sliders
Along with beef (very good) they also sell bite size Chicken Parm (never had) Turkey (nothing special) Veggie (I didnt like but I think veggie burgers are junk in general) and BBQ pulled chicken (worth trying)
since there is no white-castle on the upper east side
this place will do
BUT this place doesnt have white-castle prices
You'd get more food for your $ if you went to wendys, BK or Micky D's
this is not a cheap burger place like white castle
Great finger licking good mini burgers
The fryes aren't so bad either
Cafe Trevi is reminiscent of walking into the best restaurant in a small Italian Village
Excellent food, service, in an intimate setting, is well worth every dollar you spend
I have been dining there since the 1980's on a recommendation from a food aficionado
I went there a few days ago on a friends recommendation and I found the food to be outstanding
I recommend the bolognese sauce
It has a wonderfully rich wine taste
The service was great
If i do have one complaint it is that the decor and ambience was a bit stuffy and not as hip as i'm accostumed to
I recommend if you are ever in the upper east sde
I've been to Rosa Mexicano, and the only thing they had better was the guacamole
Every part of the dinner was great, and the Bannana Margarita was the best drink I have ever had
Will be back very soon
I eat dinner out 355 days a year (I don't cook, can't cook, don't know how to use a microwave, I'm born and raised here, leave me alone about how can I NOT cook)
Arriba Arriba is one of my favorites, love this place, good food, good margaritas
For those Citysearch moderators who read my reviews and wonder whether I like anything at all, I always say such and such was 'average,' this is one place I love
If you want amazing food, good prices, and good margaritas, this is the place
food was great - shredded chicken burrito, mama's burrito (vegetarian)
salsa is amazing here, the chips could use more salt
service is very very quick
margertias were good and spiked
price is very reasonable
don't think this place is romantic, it is very loud, it is hard to hear people speaking
very cramped
great music
My friends and I have coming here for years we never dissapointed
The razon Great Margaritas and Good Food
friendly service
I was there recently for a birthday party on a Saturday night, with a dozen people and have to say that overall the place was a great time
The service was excellent, the food was delicious and the margaritas were huge
As for the ambience it was nice and laid back with good background music
After all was said and done everyone really enjoyed themselves
I would definitely go back there
Incredibly mixed reviews at this one
Dave says,'Top Shelf' margaritas are mediocre overpriced
Dave and Mykel think, 'Food's okay, but overpriced and nothing special
Friendly bar staff and service
Bob, Great Empanadas
A+ Ai says 'food and music are good
I'd love to come back
' Kinya likes the food but complains it's not hot and spicy

I have lived in nyc for 2 years and have tried pretty much every mexican restaurant on the upper east side
This is by far the best
I'm from the west coast where the mexican cuisine is inexpensive, plentiful and delicious! This place isn't cheap but it's definitely tasty
The tables are a bit crowded and the service isn't great, but it's worth it if you're craving a big burrito or a cheesy enchilada
Come and try the real mexican food in NYC, at arriba arriba, the food and margaritas are great, the staff are very friendly, come and have a good time as me, it's really the best mexican food restaurat
The food is delish, the lighting is just right, the service is always friendly, but the greatest feature for coming to Arriba Arriba is the margaritas! Just drink one of the Mamas and you will be loaded! It is not just that they are strong (for once you can actually get your money's worth for a drink in this town), but it is also that it is because they are so good! This is a fun place to come with friends, family, children, and a date
The restaurant may not be the cheapest Mexican eats, but they certainly serve great food with the best margaritas!
Affordable, yummy food, OK service, the best happy hour, good lunch and brunch special menus
In this noisey, always packed and cramped Mexican restaurant you'll find great food, drinks and very inexpensive prices
The enchiladas are excellent and the margheritas pack quite a punch
Just don't expect any elbow or leg room and try to avoid this place on the weekends
I highly recommend it for a week night when you just don't feel like cooking
Arriba Arriba! is a great place for lunch
Quick, Cheap and Great Food
Can't beat that
My friends and I went here on a Sunday after a big night out for lunch
We were all amazed at the low prices that were offered on the brunch and lunch menu
The food was tasty and you had a nice selection to choose from
Definitely a must for lunch on the weekends
For $5
95 you can have a loaded Burrito and a complimentary Sangria, Margarita or Wine
After being in the neighborhood for 7 months, I finally gave this quaint looking restaurant a try
My girlfriend and I found the food quite good, but nothing extraordinary, especially by Manhattan's standards
Our waiter, on the other hand, acted as though he was playing the part of the arrogant French waiter in a Saturday Night Live skit
He acted as though it was an imposition on his august presence to deal with us
To be fair, the rest of the staff were efficient and courteous, but the waiter soured our experience and ensured we won't be returning
Service was very slow although friendly
Food was average, if you're in the neighborhood go to Sirabella's instead!
My boyfriend and I grabbed a quick dinner here last night
Restaurant is casual, spacious, and tacky
(A sushi SPORTS BAR? Come on
!) The entire place was virtually empty on a Wednesday night
Food is surprisingly pricey ($5 for edamame!) and mediocre at best
The ginger dressing on my salad was SO STRONG that it left a horrible feeling in my mouth for the rest of the night
My sashimi was fine but not extraordinarily fresh (at $15 for five pieces of fish, one would expect something better)
If you're looking for QUALITY Japanese, try Sushi Hana, Sake Hana, or Haru
only steps away!
A very good sushi place that is always fresh
They have a very extensive all you can eat menu that includes various appetizers
They also allow you to stray slightly from the all you can eat menu and their servers are very attentative
The restaurant has various TV's that allow you to watch the game while enjoying the food
Not exactly a date place, but recommended for those that want good food and service for a fair value
This place is great with freshly prepared sushi and fish dishes
Services are great

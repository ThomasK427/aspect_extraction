And what red-blooded American child wouldn't want dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets?
I don't know why this or most of the restaurants in NYC make the best of list
I've been to this place many times and it's only average
It's NOT the best
Guys, please stop raving about places that are only so-so
It's just your average diner
fast service and good food! especially glenn the waiter
he also keeps your orders just the way you want them
great place!
I have had a positive time at EJ's the 3 times I've been there
A highlight has been the service
Friendly and prompt (staff seems to work as a team
Wow
) Sandwiches and wraps are fresh and satisfying
The buffalo wings were excellent (but not a regular menu item, oddly
) The decor is diner-cute, which has its charm if you're in the mood for it
Prices are decent; it is cash-only
So I am up on the Upper West Side, and I am need a quick delivery spot (amongst the 100 other restaurants here)
but I want an American burger and I need it fast: EJ's!  It sounds good because they are definitely fast, but the food is average to bad, its not super cheap, and often its your only option
Oh and just to annoy you even further, its cash only
I suggest calling it Eduardo Johnson's or Enrique Johannsen's just to spice it up
Unfortunately, in the end, its just bland greesy American food made by students
Lovely
The Scene From the plastic grapes and ivy and colorful lights decorating the ceiling to the Mediterranean travel videos playing on TVs perched high in various corners, Niko's presents a festive, casual setting
The welcoming ambience invites both locals and tourists, and the small waiting area can become crowded
Servers are friendly, though sometimes distracted when busy
The Food The enormous menu is daunting but informative, and the wide variety easily suits a light snack, a full meal or just coffee and dessert
While sampling the complimentary bread basket and olive tapenade, don't skip over the appetizers--the lemony avgolemono soup and savory pasta fagiole are excellent
Main-course menu highlights include traditional Greek dishes like hearty moussaka and pastitsio, grilled kabobs and souvlaki, plank roasted fish and crisp, Neapolitan brick-oven pizzas
Desserts are no mere afterthought here; the homemade gianyotiko is a multi-layered delight of walnuts, almonds, honey, filo and syrup
After moving from downtown to the UWS, we find ourselves cooking often out of sheer desperation - we simply cannot find good food up here! Enter Nikos (the angels sing)
Although it looks sort of dinerish/dumpy, the food is simply amazing
I have taken family and friends and all rave it is the best greek/medit food they've ever had
The portions are huge, and the prices (for what you get), are right
Best things on the menu to get: claypot lamb stew (either on bone or off), kebob, rotisserie fish, spinach pies, crab cake, houtsiki salad, bougatsa desert
All are to die for
Really, this is without a doubt the best food on the UWS
GO!!
I came here with a good friend of mine one Sunday in July of 2005, and loved it so much that we have been back for Brunch every Sunday
The price is right, the food is great, the staff are wonderful, and we will continue to go every Sunday as long as we live in New York! You won't find a better place for Brunch---can't wait to make it for dinner one of these days!
I went to Niko's during my last night in New York
I was really looking forward to eating some good fish and there I got it
Unfortunately, there were too many nice things that we ordered a bit to much and we couldn't finish everything, but it was nice that we could bring our fish salade with us (something that you cannot think about in Europe!!)
I highly recommended the seafood salade, it comes in a big place, so to fully enjoy it, you better not order too much in advance (as I did!) Also the pasta salade with seafood was great
After reading the old reviews I had to add something new after trying the restaurant
Cramped, noisy and terrible service
The food was mediocre, they only give you two little pieces of chicken on the kabob
The falafel was so fried, I could barely make out the filling and the skordalia tasted more like mashed potates, not the creamy texture that it's supposed to have
If you want a salad, and pay $10
00 + then this is your place
What happened to the Niko's when it first opened? Back then the food was great, now, better to pass on this place
Oh this place is so awesome! There are a gazillion things on the menu, and most of them are so tasty
There are a few misses like these weird zucchini croquettes, but there are far more big hits like this lamb in a clay pot dish that is just mind blowing
Sorry, I forget what it's called
The place is a little crapmed, but everyone is friendly, the service and the customers
It's actually a really fun upper west side date place, too
They usually give you a little honey soaked dessert and a shot of some crazy sweet liqueur after dinner, which is always fun
If you order saganaki, and want them to bring it to you on fire and yell Opa!, I find that you should explicitly ask them first
My boyfriend and I stumbled into Niko's a few months ago while running errands in the neighborhood
We've loved this place ever since! I've been especially impressed by their delivery; the same courteous, English-speaking person takes my order every time and offers guidance with their encyclopedic menu (it actually has a glossary)
The food arrives promptly, hot and triple wrapped in plastic wrap! The little spinach pies are tasty, if a little buttery (but it is practically quiche, so what do you expect?), the pastitsio is a guilty pleasure, the pizzas are thin and crispy
and today I tried the scrambled egg 'boat'
I don't know how they kept the eggs hot and the ceasar salad beside them cool, but they did it
Niko's never seems to stumble
And they're making me fat
I really like this place
There is a good enough variety that you don't have to have your mind made up when you walk in the door
Can't speak for the weekend brunch menu, but the things i have had from the dinner menu have never disappointed
The service is spotty, but tends to be as courteous as the guests being served
LOVED Nikos! Service was above and beyond! Our take-outs looked as good as the freshly plated meals
Wait staff were very attentive -- even to our 3-year-old!
My boyfriend and I stopped in for breakfast
The pancakes were good but my Belgian Waffle was nothing to write home about
The staff, though not friendly, was not unkind
Would have been a nice meal except for the two jackhammers right outside the window - but, Hey! It's New York
Great Sangria
The fried eggplant strips served with luncheon entree's is fantastic
Greek American food
The menu is large, but the dishes well done
I`ve gone to Nikos the past few weekends and I will stay away! It`s good food, nice atmosphere but an very nasty waitstaff and management
That is the only thing that is turning me away
The food and service here can only be described as mediocre
Not bad, but certainly not a place you could recommend to someone
The seating is very crammed
For such a huge menu, Nikos does almost everything remarkably well, at very reasonable prices
Especially recommend the pizzas, pasta fagiole and avgolemeno soup (sp?)
Service here is usually pleasant, but erratic
Sit in the enclosed patio if possible; it's beautiful both day and night, though quite cozy
We had a large group for dinner on a Friday night
They were so hospitable and welcoming, gave us a big space downstairs, waitor staff was very attentive, friendly and no one rushed us
The portions were huge and everyone enjoyed their meal
We all had such a good time, they really made us feel at home
First of all, the service was pretty bad
We had to ask 3 times just to get water
The food was beyond bad
The chicken burito had an old taste as if it stayed on the kitchen counted for days, and then was reheated
We addressed that and asked for a GRILLED chicken quesadilla, but instead got the SAME old minsed chicken now in the quessadila form
The waitress said that it was the OWNER who prepared it - compliments of the house
I wanted to just pay and get out
The also charged us more for frozen margaritas than the special deal that was advertised in the front!!! Don't go there!!

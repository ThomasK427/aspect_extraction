Service is always prompt and the food is 100% great all the time
No matter how crowded it is the wait is never long
this place is so yummy!! Sometimes the wait is long but it's totally worth it
Their pina coladas are excellent! Their mango milk shake is really good too
But the thing you have to eat while here is their half chicken or whole with their special fried rice! it also comes with some salad and it is the ultimate dish! I'm going there tonight, matter of fact
i went to the one on 100th St location last Monday
even on weedays, it is always busy overthere, we waited at the bar for while and have some drinks, one thing im very appreciate is their services are very good, especially the cashier, she is very nice and polite, even she is busy still come to us and see did we need anything, she even make the drink for us
this restaurant im highy recommanded
The food is great, the service is great, and the prices are great which is extremely had to find in the city
My husband and I recently went to this restaurant and we would not recommended at all
We waited almost an hours for a table after being told waiting time was 20 minutes
The waiter did not understand want we wanted
We had to point to the menu like we were children
Once the food arrived the taste was not very good compare to the other places we have been to
I ordered broiled shrimps and my husband ordered paella
In Short At this simply decorated Morningside Heights staple, traditional dishes like sesame chicken and chicken stir-fry with chili peppers top the list of popular entrees
The menu's "make your own dish" option is also a hit with finicky and diet-conscious diners
In-house portions are generous; for those who'd rather gorge at home, everything on the menu can be ordered for delivery
Just keep in mind that the restaurant's free carafes of white wine are eat-in only
Food at Columbia Cottage is tasty and well prepared
My favorites include Orange Beef, Beef Lo Mein, and Crispy Shredded Beef
The ambience is pleasant and relaxing
Overall, a great neighborhood spot
Columbia Cottage (or Cottage as the undergrads like to say) may be the best value in the city
The entrees are a bit overpriced as chinese goes (by say $1) but when dining in, you get as much box wine as you can drink for free
Where else in the city can you go get completely tanked and have a good meal for the price of chinese takeout
I have made the mistake of coming back here several times because the food is pretty good (although way too much bread crumbs on the mac and cheese) but the service REALLY SUCKS
The servers try their best, but good luck getting the right food delivered to your table
On one occasion they LOST OUR ORDER COMPLETELY, and were NOT EVEN REMOTELY APOLOGETIC ABOUT IT!!! THIS PLACE NEEDS BETTER MANAGEMENT!!!!
Bullet point:  - great atomosphere (great music, friendly staff, decor) - good burgers, salads, and brownies! - kitchen is quick most of the time
However, if the place gets packed, then there seems to be an exagerated delay
Alas, you can't have it all
It's a great place though
The staff is very friendly, and they look like they enjoy being there
The kind of place where I want to become a regular, and get to know every little detail there is to know!
The food here is above average, especially their burgers, and their breakfasts specials are tasty, but the service is deplorable
All the waiters are friends, and love to chat it up while the customers' cries for help go totally unnoticed
It's reasonably priced, but not cheap
It's a step up in quality from Tom's, which is a block down the street, but Tom's is better for non-picky eaters looking to spend little cash
they make the best chopped cobb salad i've ever had
great place to meet the girls for sunday brunch, even if there's a wait
You don't go to this bar for any other reason than to get drunk
The place is great though; spacious, reasonably priced, and polite staff
Pitchers start at six bucks and shots at 5
Its a HUGE Columbia scene, so I wouldn't suggest coming here if you are over 25 at most
You can play beirut in the back room and they just renovated the downstairs where they have a very chill little lounge
FOR A GUARENTEED GOOD TIME, COME TO WEST END
Great food, great tunes, friendly people, fun place
motto is come home to west end
Can actually eat good food and not break the bank
Late night is too much like a college bar for this old timer, but love the jazz brunch on weekends
Free, too
I had never heard of team trivia, but I played it at the West End on Tuesday night
There is something going on almost every night
Different than most bars and restaurants
Fun place
Big portions, perpetual Beer special: if you eat for $12 you'll get free beer!! Food is delicious (this is not just the beer talking - it really good)
Decor very chrome, enamel and plastic (and lots of mirrors)
Huge: can seat big groups with ease
They make the perfect cafe con leche and the best ropa vieja this far north of Miami! The pernil is killer, too
Overall great Caribbean food at very reasonable prices
The only thing missing is the beach
Growing up in S
Florida, I have spent the past 9 years in NY looking for authentic and flavorful Cuban black beans
I finally found them at La Rosita
For brunch/breakfast, they serve food from many Caribbean islands which is an unusual and interesting variety
Definetely worth checking out
this place is much underrated
Not only is it the cheapest of all cheap take-out venues in the area--it's also the best! The staff will treat you like family and the food is unbeatable
My personal recommendation? The sesame cold noodles
The food is pretty good (though more American than Mexican), but the service is terrible
Our waiter was rude and disorganized when we went in, and when we called for delivery, they told us it would arrive in 20 minutes, then called back in 30 and said they weren't coming at all
I will never patronize this place again
The chips and salsa were good, the service was good, but the sangria and margaritas were very weak, the food terrible, and the portions small
I was extremely disappointed in this restaurant
Not a bad place, once you can get past the door
Which is relatively easy but the owner is extremely obnoxious and requests a college id as well as another form- kind of keeping the crowd young
It's a popular place for barnard freshmen and columbia boys looking to quickly pick one up
Happy hour is good and runs to about 11 during the week, otherwise prices are reasonable anyway
I've never eaten here, I can only discuss it in terms of a bar, where it fits into the Columbia strip (the west end, nachos, the heights and then the amsterdam bars)
Looked attractive from the street, so my group decided to check it out
If you are looking for authentic food trek down to Mama Mexico
If your looking for pdeudo Mexican vibe walk down a block to the Heights, you might have to wait at either Mama Mexico or the Heights but they are well worth it
Nacho Mama offers a great Happy hour but you might get more bang for the buck at some other CU bars
Cannon's, The Heights, or West End
I simply wanted a chicken burrito
What I got was hunks of meat swimming in condiments and disgustingly; thick, pebble-grained chicken skin and fat that just sat on top of the gloppy mess
The ambiance is alright, but for God's sake, just order a drink
Not only was the service was awful (we were overcharged), and the food was not good (sumeshi didn't taste right, the fish was dry, the Udon broth was salty and something else)
It is definitely not authentic Japanese food although it has all the basic Japanese dishes
It is Japanese food misinterpreted by non-Japanese cooks
It is not a restaurant for people who know what Japanese food is, especially sushi
The cost is definitely too high for the quality that we recieved
Would avoid
okay, so the service isn't super-friendly, but what more can you ask for than good sushi and great prices? the spicy roll combo and the bento box are great, as is the soup and salad
it's definitely worth checking out!
I eat here all the time and it's fantastic
Definitely affordable
The rolls are great, and the bento boxes a bargain at $13

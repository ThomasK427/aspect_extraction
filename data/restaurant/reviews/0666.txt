definite must go for upper east siders and others
The food was very good however the service was atrocious
I went in on a Monday night and we were one of three tables being served
The waitress barely acknowledged us and the food took about 45 minutes to be served
If you have time and do not care about being ignored I recommend the food, if not there are better places to go to
We really like this place
The food is great and the service laid back and friendly
The lodge type interior is a little odd for a Brazilian place, but hey, the owners and staff probably feel as if they are in the Arctic during a NYC winter
I'm not afraid of it getting too crowded because of its location in the not so trendy east 90s
You can usually walk right in and get a table and no one rushes you out by slapping the check down - a nice change from all the French crap on the UES
Not because I was pregnant, but the food here is always delicious
Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best (I hope Mom doesn't read this!)
Service is wonderful, seeing smelling your food being made is a plus!
I had a great experience at Zebu Grill
The food was amazing
The seafood was great and the sangria was delicious
Definitely try the yuca fries too
The staff was very sweet, the atmosphere was charming and the price was right
What a fabulous find on the Upper East Side! This is a wonderful restaurant
Warm atmosphere, terrific food, attentive service--I whole-heartedly recommend this restaurant
Not your typical Upper East Side fare
It is rather small, so I would strongly recommend reservations
Wow, this place knocked my socks off! Honestly, the food could not have been any better
The space is very small but most NY places are
We went on New Year's Eve so the wait staff was a bit overwhelmed and slow, but the owner came over and introduced herself
The food was the best I have had in a very long time
Excellent restaurant, the take out menu is nothing like the dining room menu
The ambience adds something even more special
The meals are reasonably priced with many drink options as well
In Short Tourists from all over flock to this famous Jewish-style deli for the venue's rich, star-filled history
Since opening in 1937, Stage has attracted all kinds of luminaries, and proof is provided by the wall of celebrity Polaroids that greets guests at the entrance alongside the intentionally smart-alecky waitstaff
The menu features Jewish deli standards--chopped liver, potato pancakes and stuffed derma--as well as sandwiches named for everyone from Jennifer Lopez to Nathan Lane
Ok so I wanted to try Stage Deli after hearing what a celebrity-adored spot it was, so I stopped in today
After getting checked out by half of the waiters in the restaurant, a small entourage sat me at a table
I ordered a turkey sandwich and was asked if I wanted fries or onion rings
I thought it was a choice, so I got fries
Literally a minute later, the fries came out, shortly followed by the sandwich
The fries were ok (not enough salt, but that's fixable), but the sandwich was ridiculously dry
There was a 3-inch stack of turkey, but it had no flavor, was completely dry, and was not remotely tasty in any way
They use flavor-less iceberg lettuce and the palest tomatoes I have ever seen, so basically the sandwich has no flavor whatsoever
After taking out half the turkey one half and not really wanting to have any more than that, I got it boxed up and asked for the check
And then I saw
they charged me SIX DOLLARS for a stupid little plate of fries that I wouldn't have ordered anyways (and of which I ate maybe 5 fries)
And that's on top of the terrible $14 turkey sandwich
I was somewhat furious, so I just paid and left
I would definitely advise you to NOT come here
I've been to Vida 2x in the last month - the food is amazing - large portions - and the service is incredible
It feels as though you are in Mexico w/ a mixture of Tex-Mex - I do not think many people are aware of this place - the last 2x I've been - dinner at 8pm - I had my choice of where to sit
FINE BY ME! I'm sure this little secret wont last for long! MUST GO TO THIS RESTAURANT
We waited 20 minutes before anyone came by to take our orders
After finally ordering, we were given a plate of olives that had to last us through another 40 minutes of waiting! The manager finally came by to apologize and offered to give us a greek salad on the house
Finally eating, we finished the salad well before our orders arrived
The kebab sampler, grapeleaf wrapped salmon, and eggplant dishes were WONDERFUL! Very tasty
Afterward, the manager offered free desserts for making us wait - the shredded wheat and honey dish and milk custard were DIVINE! I LOVED the food, too bad the service was so slow
I think this place would be a 10 if they would overhaul the wait staff
Go when you're not in a rush!
I went to dinner on Saturday around 7pm
The place was busy, but not full to capacity
We got our menus relatively quick, but that was it, no one came to give us water
When we finally ordered, we ordered the vegeterian sample appetizer, which is basically an assortment of various spreads
We enjoyed it very much
Our main courses were okay, but after the appetizer we were unable to finish, and took the rest home
Unfortunately, we had to wait a little while to get our doggie bag
I'd say the overall experience was good, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you're short on time
Nice dining room (dark woods deep colors, Turkish flavor, with full bar and 2nd floor view of Montague Street), didn't realize there was a patio in the back, but would go back to try that out before it gets too cold
Great deal
My husband had a kebab plate that was a good amount of food, nicely marinated, and generally well-prepared
I had some kind of eggplant and cheese thing that I wouldn't order again, but I don't think it was the restaurant's fault that it was too cheezy for my taste
Interesting assortment of Turkish juices and wide array of menu choices
There was only one waiter for the entire restaurant so I wouldn't recommend it for big groups, but the one waiter we had was courteous and attentive
I eat there almost every week and they have the best calamari , and mixed grill is realy juicy
I love the patio at the back of restaurant where I can puff my hookah
You have try it to find out yourself what are you missing
Especially me and my girlfriend love the belly dancer show friday or saturday nights
By the way if you have time during the day try $ 8
95 lunch special with cold turkish beer at the patio
i ordered a meal that tasted like sour feet
i have traveled to Turkey and Greece and know how this food should taste
I mentioned that it was oilyl and that i wanted to take it back
They refused and said that it was the bottom of the pan which was why it was so greasy and it was just the last of the pot
The waiter was rude and I told him that I would still pay for it, but would like another meal and he refused
BEWARE
I went here with a group of friends, drawn by the al fresco dining
One thing after another went wrong
We received the wrong appetizer and one wrong entree, two people waited an extra 15 minutes for their entrees to come out, two other entrees arrived cold
Rice wasn't brought out and that also took an extra 15 minutes
It took at least 30 minutes to get our bottle of wine - we had to ask 3 times
Water was never refilled, plates were dirty
They did end up comping one of our entrees, but overall the waitstaff was hardly apologetic about all the problems
Oh, and to top it off my boyfriend got a little surprise from an overhead bird during the meal
obviously not the restaurant's fault, but fitting nonetheless
Needless to say, we will not be going back
Went there for the first time on a Saturday night
A really nice place for good Turkish good, relaxed ambience, and excellent service
Plus, it's only a few blocks away from the Brooklyn Heights promenade
The breaded egggplant appetizer was terrific, one of those dishes which causes you to stare at each other and say out loud how good it is
My girlfriend's veggie entree was good
My lamb was a little overcooked, but overall was fine
As for dessert, the rice pudding was delicious
Service was exceptional, one of the better experiences I've had in New York, especially considering that it was only around $30/person for all that food plus a drink for each of us and coffee afterwards

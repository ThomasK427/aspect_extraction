of course, the only thing that REALLY matters is taste and sugar sweet delivers
cakes are moist with just the right density
frostings are flavorful and complement the cakes well
vanilla is classic -- my favorite in the city
lemon is PERFECTLY tart and sweet
pistachio is a hit w/ all -- beautiful to look at AND taste
a very grown up cupcake
something for everyone
everyone is happy
check it out!!
the cupcakes are delightfully yummy (i much prefer these to magnolia), i love the plain white and pistachio
and i like the coffee
but for some reason i get a weird vibe from the girls there
i used to go here a lot but not so much anymore because of it
they're not unpolite per se
just not friendly
at all
from a cute neighborhood bakery called sugar sweet sunshine, it's just not the vibe i'd expect
oh well what can you do
i'll still drop by occasionally because the cupcakes are worth it
How nice to not have to line up for miles for these moist, flavor-packed cupcakes!!! It's such a cute cafe, and the Chai Latte is not bad too
We had the Pumpkin Spice Cupcake which was not too sweet, and the Red Velvet one that was just as heavenly
I definitely must come back to try the other flavors!
these are the best cupcakes in new york
a lot of people like magnolia but these cupcakes are so much better
they just melt in your mouth
and the icing is not overly sweet
we even get birthday cakes and cupcakes for our corporate functions
SO GOOD!
They have more than just yummy cupcakes - cookies, pies and ice box cakes, but its impossibel to leave without a cupckae
They have a bunch of different cupcakes but I would skip the pumpkin cupcake, its more muffiny
Great desserts, wonderful and consistent
We have ordered many dozens of cupcakes (even on short notice) for our office functions and birthdays
The owners Peg and Deb not only are impeccable bakers, their cake is moist, delicate and delicious
Their icings are unbelievably flavorful
and are worthy to consider eating alone! Can I have cake with my icing? Not only are the desserts the best
they deliver!
Even if you're up by Central Park or on the Upper East Side, its worth the trip to Rivington Street to sample the goodies that are cooking in Peggy and Debbie's kitchen
The cupcakes are scrumptious, the cakes and pies are amazing, the banana pudding is beyond description
The whole experience takes you back to the days of when you Mom whipped up something special in the kitchen for dessert after Sunday Dinner - EXCEPT at SSS you can get that something special EVERY DAY
I was stuck in a jam TWICE where Buttercup Bakery couldnt fill an order for me due to not enough time I called SSS and the girls were so nice and willing to help me out
They even deliver! Everyone at my office who swear by buttercup, tasted SSS cupcakes and now we only order from them
So friendly, great service and great desserts
I have called them twice to personally thank them for saving me! Check them out
it is worth it!
The cup cakes are divine
beats all other places hands down
I have tasted similar cupcakes only once (a colleague makes them for work occasions)
The spice cupcake is great - actually all of them are
Moist, not too sweet but sweet enough
The coffee cake for breakfast is great too
The 2 girls are very sweet and very hardworking
Prices are reasonable and the bakery is cute! So not worth going Magnolia
this is the place!
The girls here have always been really sweet to me
The cheesecake here is amazing, it must weigh 7 pounds! Cupcakes are yummy and cookies, too
Based on its great reviews on Citysearch, on 2/7/05 in the evening I decided to pay a visit to SSS
The decor was nice, but the woman behind the counter was extremely unfriendly
After I smiled and said hello, she acted like she didn't want to be there and I found her glaring at me while I took a few seconds to choose the flavors I wanted
No other customers were there
She even shot me a strange, resentful look when ringing up my order and muttered something under her breath! As rude as all of this was, it was almost too ridiculously funny to get angry at her over it
The cupcakes are fine, though not as spectacular as I expected
But, my whole experience was tainted the second I walked in the door
My first visit there is, I think, my last
Bad service is a good deterrent
we hired SSS to do our wedding cupcakes
debbie and peggy were so fantastic, understanding and capable
together we created an awesome cupcake pyramid as our wedding cake for 250 people! peggy ordered special foil cups and toppings and created custom colored icings based on our color scheme
the cupcakes were so delicious and amazing that people are telling us that the dream about them
this is the best cupcake bakery in NY if not the world!
I love baked goods and I have eaten most of the bakeries in NYC
Sugar Sweet Sunshine has THE BEST cupcake in NYC (I can't say the world since I have not eaten everwhere in the world)
It's better than Magnolia's and Billy's
Wow
I had Lemon Cupcake and it was out of this world
I don't go all that crazy on cupcakes since the cake tend to be on a dry side
But Sugar Sweet Sunshine's cupcakes are so moist and icing sooo smoothly rich! The owners were very sweet, too
They also serve VERY GOOD cup of java (I looove good coffee to go with great cupcake!)
I'm a dessert connoisseur and certainly have been to every great bakery in NYC
During my 26th week of pregnancy I was unfortunately diagnosed with gestational diabetes and was disappointed that I could no longer have Sugar Sweet Sunshine's desserts esp
their OOEY GOOEY chocolate cupcake cake
I called to ask if they could make a diabetic-friendly version and this was the only bakery that went out of their way to accomodate my request
They are willing to try out any recipe
Debbie (co-owner) went through great lengths researching diabetes and looking through diabetic recipes
And, she attempted baking several versions for almost 2 weeks until she was able to make an amazingly delicious chocolate version of the OOEY GOOEY one I loved
Everyone at my baby shower was surprised it was a low carb and made with Splenda
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!!! They are amazing esp
Debbie!
A friend and I accidently stumbled onto this bakery and it has been the best discovery ever
The cupcakes are incredible (and I am not a cupcake person), the service - genuine
And the pumpkin cupcakes - unreal
I highly recommend it
First of all, I am so thankful that this place hasn't become insanely packed yet
It is just the perfect little sweets shop
Cupcakes are cheap and delicious
The cake is light and moist and the frosting is perfect- light, creamy, and just wonderful
The owner, who is also the server, is friendly
The lounge area truly invites lounging
And they also have coffee, teas and all that good stuff
All in all, a wonderful place

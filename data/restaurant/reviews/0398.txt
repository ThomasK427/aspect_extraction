The food selection is tempting, but they fail to deliver as the menu promises
Service is slow and prices are hefty
After you walk down the long flight of stairs and into the street, you can't help but look at other restaurants and wonder why you ate at Opia
Opia is all about the ambience
The food is ok, the service is not the best
It's definitely one of popular after-work spots in the area
It has a great lounge with lots of room and a casual feel
The food was ok
Despite the lack of choices in the area, Opia is permanately off the list of options
It is poorly managed with a below average crowd
A friend organized a party here of 12 people - called ahead, spoke to the manager, and the manager failed to deliver on the most simple of requests (involving the one TV in the bar, which is permanately tuned to tennis for no apparent reason)
There are thousands of more worthy bars to frequent thant this poorly-run joint
I am not sure where that person before this one ate but the place I ate at was great
A group of friends and I found this place through time out New York
It proved to be right on the money with its French fair
I had the duck which melted in my mouth
My friend raved about here pasta dish witch reminded her of her trip to Italy
Overall everyone enjoyed there dishes
The prices are right for the type of dinning
I highly recommend finishing the meal with a liquor
Wait staff was pleasant and helpful in our wine choices
I loved it I do not care what that person said
We went to Opia to enjoy a nice dinner and ended up leaving completely disappointed, not only by the food but by the service
The food was overpriced for what it was, not to mention it did not appear to be very fresh
I would not recommend this place to anyone
There are so many wonderful restaurants in New York, and unfortunately this is not one of them
SAVE YOUR MONEY!
Another one of these places owned and run by people who have an exaggerated sense of their own self-worth
The uptight female manager came up to our table and rudely asked us to get up because they had a party waiting to eat
This was after we told the clueless hostess we only wanted to have drinks, and she seated us at a table
Expensive, cocktails made by bartenders who seemed to be chosen for looks rather than mixing skills -what else is new? French owner stood in the dining room talking loudly on his cellphone, wearing sunglasses! S'il vous plait!! Will I go back? NON!
I had some friends to meet for drinks and Opia turned out to be the best spot in midtown for sure
Nice, relaxed atmosphere and great cocktails!
I recently threw a Baby Shower at Opia for 33 people
Everything went very well, and I would have recommended Opia UNTIL faced with the last 45 minutes
The staff had apparently booked the room for 2 groups with a 30 minute overlap
I could not believe how they allowed the second group of 20 people to enter our PRIVATE room
The group walked right through our circle of gifts where we were taking pictures, and stayed right in the corner about 2 feet away from the guest of honor opening the gifts
We now have strangers in all the pictures taken at the last 30 minutes of the part
There was NO Reason for the overlap, and NO Reason for letting in a group of 20 people in a private closed room
Our party ended right on time - and we were out within 5 minutes
We have six people went for this year's restaurant week, and it turn out everyone have really bad experience @ Opia
Bad service, Bad food, and worse of all the waiter didn't tell us they are out of apple tart; instead, they just handed to us a peach tart
They have no intention to mention to the customer
This was my worse restaurant experience!
Just celebrated my 30th B-Day with 13 friends in the lounge/Den
We loved it
The atmosphere was sophisticated yet comfortable
The food was great
The goat cheese and tomato pizza was excellent as well as other loung menu items
Our server Julie did and excellent job as well
My friends were very impressed with my selection
I don't know what's up with the negative reviews, but I've been to Opia twice and it's been great every time
Opia has a very cool music lounge
We hung out for Soul Jam Night on a Monday and saw some very hot singers can just grab the mike and belt out a Marvin Gaye song
Lots of Broadway stars in the audience
It was one of those only in New York experiences that I will never forget
I'll definately be back with more friends next time
Hard to believe it'a got a less-than-deserved rating
I really liked Opia
It's definitely one of best after-work spots I have been to
It has a great lounge with lots of room and an attractive classy crowd
I recently had dinner in their dining room and was blown away by the food --- and the service was impecable
Definitely recommend it to anyone
The Scene With its vintage Harlem photographs and campy strawberry curtains, this uptown fixture feels like a less touristy version of its sibling restaurant, Miss Mamie's
Church ladies sporting extravagant hats rub shoulders with bigwig locals, and community organizers regularly hold meetings over Southern-style meat loaf, candied yams and blackeyed peas, with nary a yuppie in sight
The Food The menu offers a full range of soul-food favorites
Happily, the food seems slightly tastier at this location: The catfish is crispier, the collard greens spicier and just glancing at the smothered chicken will give you a heart attack
The sampler menu inexpensively satiates the indecisive with a variety of specialties including shrimp, ribs and chicken
Whenever in the mood for some down home soul food this (or its sister restaurant - Ms
Mamie's Spoonbread) is the place to go
The catfish, my favorite is light and fluffy
My boyfriend loves the smothered chicken
Both locations are small and not fancy, but its definitely worth the visit
Only con is the iced tea, which can make you a serious contender for diabetes
Also unless you're getting a salad, don't bother counting calories
Great variety of food, all of it tasty and healthy
This restaurant has principles and sticks to them
Food tates great, is very healthy and reasonably priced
Gives me great ideas for cooking at home to continue tasty, healthy eating habits
I love The Pump
I eat there almost every day, and the food always makes me feel great
For you guys who say the food is bland, I'm just curious how often you do anything physical - The Pump is not for people whose idea of a good time is a slice of pizza
The food tastes great to me, but I guess that's because I don't usually eat a lot of rich food
I love the salads because they are super fresh
Also, try the baked felafel, the humus, the rookie steakburger, the grilled chicken sandwich with non-fat mozzerella and tomato sauce
Oh, and they have awsome lentil soup
This place is amazing
I've been eating at The Pump for 5 years, and it always makes me feel great
This is the place to eat lunch
if you are interested in fitness
Almost everybody I work with who goes to the gym eats at The Pump for lunch
And we get results
They also have an amazing breakfast
I always get the Turbo omelet
Not only does their food taste so good that it makes you want to cry, but it is perfectly filling and you don't feel sick after eating it because it has the perfect combination of proteins, nutrients, carbs and vitamins
I order every night at work from them and then I order three times a day from them during the summertime when I am training for my ironman
Everything from their food, to their efficient and professional staff makes me love ordering from them
And don't you just love the costumes they wear when passing out fliers!
Pump is so delicious

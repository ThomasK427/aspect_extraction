Never again would I set foot into this place
You can get better and cheaper rice and beans from any spanish american restaurant
I ordered rice and beans with a chicken dish
I thought the chicken was moist and tender and the rice and beans were delicious
Also, the bread they gave as an appetizer was moist and warm
YUMMY!
Chicken and rice (arroz con pollo) is great - the chicken is pulled off the bone and the whole dish is very savory and moist
Get the fried sweet plantains too!
Plantains sometimes stale and dry! The combination plates are a rip-off! If you order just rice and beans, it's about $6
If you order rice and beans and plantains or vegetables, it's a few dollars more, but get this: they give you less of each item! I witnessed this firsthand last time when I ordered rice, beans, and plantains combo and my friend ordered just rice and beans
The waitress did offer to bring more rice and beans if needed, which I took her up on
I received plenty of beans, but only a meager amount of extra rice, certainly not enough to complement the beans
Upon receiving the check I became furious to learn the little bit of extra rice cost $3
So while my friend paid $6 for his plate, I paid $11
50 for essentially the same amount of rice and beans, plus some stale plantains
Never again!
I enjoyed Rice 'n' Beans
It was a bit claustrophobic - not too much room in the restaurant, but I guess I can't expect all that much in NYC
The food was good though
This was my first time having Brazilian food and unfortunately it maybe my last
The food isn't great
The chicken dish I had was served lukewarm and tough
The rice and beans were just o
k
The serve is not great either
The party I was with waited for what seemed like forever just for water
Overall if you desperate for relatively cheap and tasteless food than this is for you
For the rest of you, go some place else
Being from Brazil, I am generally more critical then the average customer; however, the food here is great! Homestyle cooking, very cozy, and the wait staff are incredibly sweet
Definitely recommend it!!!
I went there to have lunch with a vegetarian co-worker
It was our first time there and we were wonderfully surprised
The price was right
The service was attentive
The food was fabulous
I liked the homey, cozy atmosphere and the Brazilian pop music
Also, try the Guarana soft drink
I went one night last spring, so maybe things have changed for the better, but when I went the service was awful
We waited to get out menus, then waited about 20/30 minutes to have our orders taken, our drinks were not brought out until after the main course was brought out
The waitress was ignoring everybody in the restaurant, and chatting on the phone! The food was so-so, not the best Brazilian, but defintely not worth the slow and rude service
The Scene Long before Babbo and Fiamma came on the scene, San Domenico was showing New York what refined Italian cuisine was all about
This elegant eatery at the base of Central Park still draws a well-heeled crowd, and the decor, featuring pieces of modern art hanging throughout the window-lined dining room, adds to the air of subdued opulence
The Food Chef Odette Fada matches the setting's sophistication with a menu that melds old world technique with creative flair
She uses a sea urchin filling for her delicate raviolini and cocoa powder to add an earthy note to pappardelle with pheasant and red wine sauce
Some dishes, such as spaghetti with tomato sauce and tiramisu, don't justify their price tags, but others, like the unctuous almond-crusted poached egg with cheese fondue, are worth every penny
First of all I eat out primarily for the food (especially if its a solo lunch) and the food here was quite good
The service was barely ok, the waiters are fun to watch but I had to ask for water 5 times
The decor is nothing great but not offensive
But the food
I had a perfectly cooked mixed greens dish followed by a nice cut of bass in a simple but tasty vegetable herb broth followed by a beautiful eggless custard cream topped with strawberries and finally some complimentary homemade cookies that went perfectly with the espresso
To top off the great food the owners daughter was quite nice and had an after dinner drink sent to me
Ill be back for dinner with my girlfriend to explore the menu a bit more
This restaurant costs too much and delivers too little
There is no reason to pay $23 for a single ravioli
Food is dull, flavorless
Nothing is terribly tasty
Service is lackluster
Don't ask the hostess or watiers for anything special
They'll tell you they will do things for you and then completely ignore you
If you feel like paying $15 for a salad and $20 for a plate of spaghetti because you want to eat with the beautiful people, then come here, but if you're more about good food and nice decor (San Domenico is so ugly with no real atmosphere), go someplace else
WHEN IN COMES TO ITALIAN FOOD SAN DOMENICO IS #1
THEY HAVE THE BEST PROSCUITTO, THE BEST RAVIOLI ON THE PLANET (THE ONE WITH THE EGG IN THE MIDDLE), THE BEST PASTA AND UNREAL DESSERTS
AND YES THEY DONT PUT GARLIC ON EVERY DISHES
We were seated prompty (with an early reservation)
The food was just above average
Service was good throughout the dinner but when it came time to get the check, we waited over 20 min
to get their attention
Won't be returning
The amuse bouche of freshly, thin-sliced prosciutto was lovely, as was the food, all-around
My dinner companions thought the portions were a bit small compared to similar restaurants, but i felt satisfied
The chef's use of polenta in both appetizer and dessert was superb
The entree of half chicken was moist and delicious; its accompanying roasted onion slivers was a perfectly executed, sweet compliment
The desserts were the best course, hands down
One of the best panna cottas in the city
The wine list was on the pricey side, though we still found nice wines on the few $75 bottles available
Service was cordial and smooth
Would not mind returning, though this will not be what we'd classify as a destination restaurant - a place you go out of your way to go to
Finally, a french restaurant where traditional french is done right
I went here last weekend and really enjoyed it
The wait staff was good, and the sauces for the entrees were beyond perfection
I would highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates finer classical french food
The restaurant itself is not the most beautiful nor large but the food and red house wine surely make your other senses too busy to care
Maybe it's because they are so very French
I called before Christmas to see if they would be open Jan 1, New Year's Day
I asked twice -- and was assured they would be open, and they took my reservation
When I arrived in New York -- NOT OPEN! When I called, I was told that no one there would make such a mistake and it was not they're problem
I was disappointed -- and I know I didn't make the mistake -- someone at the place gave me bad information
The real frustration was that they wouldn't just say they were sorry for the mistake -- even when I asked for that -- they just told me I was wrong and it wasn't their problem
If that's how they treat you before you get in the door -- they can keep that door locked all the time!!
My girlfriend and I were 'this' close to writing off French Food entirely
We had been to a few places around Manhattan and ALL of them were CRAP
So today was our 3 year anniversary and we were looking for a place to go for a romantic dinner
She said Chez Napoleon? So we looked up the menu and said to each other This is IT
If this place can't make a good French meal, then there is NO French Food in Manhattan! Well, the food was great
OK I thought, this is GOOD FRENCH FOOD! Finally
After dinner I thanked the bartender and told him how this was the only good French food we had found in Manhattan
He said Thank you, it IS my grandmother cooking back there, so you understand that it IS going to be true French food
Great place
I'll come back
We like and frequent this place for several years

Bottom line, don't go here for the food
Very mediocre
all through the UWS, not creature was stirring not even at Jean Luc
As a first timer I can't really judge the crowd b/c there was none, as it was a holiday weekend I think many were out of town
The space is nice
The atmosphere was warm and cozy
The bartender Jason kept the champagne flowing and Jean Luc kept the music interesting
Next time I will eat (the escargot looked fabulous) and hopefully be able to see what the social scene is all about here
from the moment you walk in you are transformed to South Beach
There is no way this restaurant belongs on the Upper West Side
I sat at the bar with my date and decided to eat at the bar which overlooked the front dining room
Great artichoke vinaigrette
and the venison stew was awesome!
Strongly suggest one order fries with their entree
Overall great experience, a little crowded at times, but the back diners seemed comfortable and removed from the action
I was ready to hate this place, really I was
I *never* eat uptown--having suffered through the lack of UWS dining options for 2 years, I couldn't wait to slam Jean-Luc
We had a 9:30 reservation for a Sat night--the place was full, but we were seated promptly
Excellent food, nice staff
I found the place a little bright, but I'm a sucker for candles
Overall, excellent addition to the UWS
Took a date here recently
the atmosphere was hip and fun yet romantic, the crowd was stylish, the food was solid, the wine was awesome
I scored big points for taking her to this place and let's just say I wound up having breakfast with her, too
impressive balcony seating and while they forgot to give us the cold appetizers, the waiter and maitre'd more than made up for it by being most accomodating to us
all in all, the food was fine and they had a nice listing of wines by the glass
I would go back!
Overall disappointing after all the buzz
ok, the food was slightly above average, but not worth the money
To give some French cachet to the place, the maitre d'hotel (and to a lesser degree the waiters) take on a fake snobby attitude, but forget that french style comes with friendliness and cordiality as well
First of all I don't work for JL, nor am I a particularly well educated foodie
And I am being honest when I say that I enjoyed my dinner at JL last night
We made a reservation for 4 people at 7 p
m
and were seated as soon as the entire party arrived at 7:02 p
m
The hostess and staff ALL made us feel welcome
I had the foie gras to start, the tuna for my entree and warm choc
cake for dessert
Everything was cooked to our specifications and we had a lovely bottle of Rhone Valley wine
The service was efficient
Dinner including cocktails, wine, appetizers, entrees and desserts cost $235
My only comment is that JL is a REAL scene
models, actors, rich people, yuppies and others
It got quite loud around 9p
m
when the bar got crowded
Some people (myself included) love that kind of excitement
The Scene You want intimate? Squeeze into this cozy, casual parlor in off-the-beaten-path East Williamsburg
Young couples canoodle in mix-and-match, leather-upholstered booths, while candlelight flickers off the heavily painted stucco and wood-paneled walls
Service is friendly and well-paced
The Food  DuMont's tiny, market-fresh menu delivers simple, well-composed plates of updated American fare
Start with one of two good, basic mixed-greens salads, then tackle a tender steak with hot and crispy, parsley-studded fries, or old, reliable "DuMac
My first experience at Dumont was on Valentines day
My reservation was at 6:00 and we arrived at 5:45 so we could have a drink at the bar
We didn't realize that they WILL NOT open the door until promptly at 6, nor would they even come to the door (they were all sitting around inside) as we froze our buns off in the cold, to tell us that we would have to wait
The finally opened the door at 6:05 and I had already lost my appetite in the freezing cold
The service was ok, the food was good, but I thought one of the managers was a little rude
Still I decided to give it another chance two weeks later for brunch
Again ,I arrived a bit too early and had to sit outside - fine - i expected that
But then when I went inside, there was no heat on in the restaurant
When I asked the waiter if they were going to put the heat on, he went over to the same manager to ask him
The manager started sreaming so we could hear him I can't control the damn heat!
Was that an unreasonable request in February? I was upset and wanted to leave but my husband wanted to stay, so we sat there and watched a bunch of the staff laugh and stare at us! Then, I ate my burnt french toast and left
I have been a manager in a restaurant for 5 years and know what it's like to have to deal with rude customers, but I would NEVER be rude back to them
Not to mention that I tried to be exceptionally nice as to not appear like a complaining customer
Since several months have gone by, we thought about going back tonight and give it one more shot (our freinds still rave about it)
After checking these reviews, FORGET IT
It's not worth the trip!
Have been here dozens of times and have always had a great experience
The food is great, the service is great, the outdoor seating is great
What a has been! A huge fan of Dumont for YEARS, it really sucks to admit that this place is on its way DOWN
It's really unfortunate to now have to wait super long for high priced food (it seems the prices get higher every time we visit)
And when I received my $9 glass of wine, I had to ask the waitress if she planned on putting more in -- there was hardly any liquid in the glass! (she blamed new, bigger glasses
Later she did fill the glass more)
It didn't help that our intimate little table soon became overrun by people waiting
sorry, but ambiance goes out the window when folks are shoved upagainstyourchair while you're trying to eat and have a quiet conversation! Sad to say, but dumont isnt' worth the hassle anymore
we'll let the others battle it out for a subpar experience
I had brunch here recently with some friends who love this place
It was awful
First, we had to wait over 45 minutes for a table
Then, after we placed our orders, our drinks never came
When we aked for them, only half of us got what we ordered
There is nothing on the brunch menu for vegetarians
My friend ordered the burger medium, and it came literally bloody
I liked what I ordered - omelette and a generous side order of bacon, and I liked the ambience, but the service was just terrible!
i agree with the previous reviewer, AVOID THIS PLACE
while the waitress was perfectly nice i found the management to be bordering on abusive! regardless of how good a burger is, poor service and abusive management is enough to make anyone lose their appetite (and the desire to ever return)
if you want to have your dinner ruined by mean people who could care less about you and only care about your money and getting you out the door, then go to dumont! enjoy!
I had my first and LAST visit to Dumont
I was late for a birthday dinner
After asking for a seat, the host was rude and unaccomodating
I took responsibility for being late but the host got angry
I didn't want to make a big deal since it was my friend's birthday
She tried to deal with him - then he got rude with her! On her birthday! I couldn't believe his behaviour! I left
My friends skipped on dessert as they felt unwelcome
I don't care how good the food is-rudeness to customers should not be tolerated
And as the more recent posts illustrate, my experience isn't unique
Service has gone downhill
AVOID this place

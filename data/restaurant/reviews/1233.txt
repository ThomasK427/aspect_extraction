Served with rice, the breakfast satisfied
All the while they were cutting limes and tearing mint for the mojitos so the place was filled with summer smells, and the coco cappucino is truly a delight! For a taste of the forbidden Island, this place rocks
solid meal--filling tasty
bright cheery atmosphere removes you from what can be a din-y dingy city
we always have a fine time at this spot
for those of us that had never been to cuba, try this one
you'll not be dashed
try the ropa vieja and also their mojitos
casual and friendly service
Wonderful little spot to have brunch
Not for big groups, as it's so crowded, but perfect for two
The cafe con leche is fabulous
Definitely go!
The Scene Fans of the former tenant, East Post, will rejoice: The space has been only slightly tweaked, and for the better
The mix-n-match, knickknacky decor has a bit more polish, and the room is a little brighter, with candles casting a flattering glow
Servers are friendly and well-meaning, but still require a cheat sheet to recite the specials
The Food It's a people-pleasing menu, with spaghetti and meatballs, calamari, eggplant Parmesan and other red-sauce classics alongside several more upscale dishes
But it's the former that satisfy most, especially sweet, savory eggplant caponato on bruschetta, and the decadent lasagna, melting with heavenly layers of bechamel and meat sauces
More ambitious dishes sometimes falter, as with overcooked monkfish in olive-chili-tomato sauce, and lamb "osso buco," which, despite being impressively tender, lacks flavor dimension
For dessert, the gelato (from Il Labrotorio del Gelato on the Lower East Side) is incredibly delicious
I went out with two other people on Saturday night
We decided to check this restaurant out for dinner, as it has outdoor seating
That is the only positive thing I can say about this place
We each ordered salads to start
The waitress kept telling us it was coming out soon
After waiting 45 minutes, we received our salads
Each salad was brought out not as ordered
Two of us ordered the bass and one of us ordered the filet mignon as our main course
This restaurant should be embarassed at the way the food was presented to us
The fish left all to be desired
It wasn't even cooked! It was so undercooked, it looked like it just came out of the sea! The filet mignon was cut into pieces like skirt steak
It was so dry, it looked like it had been sitting out for days! There was not one drop of juice coming out of the steak
We told the waitress that we would not be eating our main courses, as we felt this was unacceptable service
Please save yourself the money and grief of eating at this establishment!
I went there for a late dinner last night with a friend and the service was aweful
The first time the waiter took our order he didn't seem to understand what we were saying
The second time he came over to us because he could only remember the appetizer
He couldn't read his own handwriting for the entree, and then he proceeded to tell us it was because he was drunk, which we both believed
Then he came back a 3rd time b/c he still couldn't remember the entrees
At this point my friend wrote it down for him
All the while he would whisper in her ear which freaked her out
Don't bother going there
there are so many other options in the neighborhood
When the waiter made his fifth reference to do you want to see me juggle, because that's what it's like working here tonight we were annoyed
We had to ask REPEATEDLY for water and bread, and when they finally complied, they brought 4 glasses of water to 6 people
The waiter blamed the bus staff for all this
I said AGAIN that we needed one more glass of water, and he brought a wine glass, saying that was the only clean glass there was
Then they brought us the wrong dish, and did not offer to make it right
The waiter said they mixed it up because there were three similar things on the menu
I would have been happier at Gray's Papaya
i went at Poetessa with my girl friend to look at the private room that they have in the back
As soon as we arrived to the place we had a super welcoming hello that make us understand that we defenitly consider the place for our engagement party
The Zagat Survey rating 2006 just confirmed it
We have been warmly invited to have a glass of wine at the bar after discussing the different menu options for a group of 35 people
We end up having dinner and were very satisfied with the very nice service and the excelent food well balanced with the music
We loved it
My husband I have been eating here since it was East Post and it's one of our favorite restaurants
We've only had a problem with service once and we've been here 10 times
The owner is great and charming, as well as the waiters and hostess
They remembered us when we hadn't been there in months
We always find an entree we love and we often go here just for the chocolate cake dessert (it was better when it was East Post but still very good)
Overall, love this restaurant and definitely recommend it
Visited Sunday 5pm, sat outside amongst 3 other couples in the entire place
Long wait for the waiter to us for drinks, we had to ask for bread
Calamari for appetizer, portion was so small you couldn't possibly share, consistency of the calamari was too rubbery, it was fried but it appeared white
Entree: gnocchi which was good, in a nice tomatoe sauce
Boyfriends spaghetti Chittani was served in large bowl, but barely filled it - way too small, quality was good
Dinner: $55: 2 entrees 2 sodas 1 appt, tip
Left so hungry we had to stop at a pizzeria for some filling dishes
Service was too slow it took us 2 hours to finish since the time in between meals was long
I can't imagine how slow they would be with a packed restaurant
Skip it
The staff at this restaurant is completely clueless
Once you're seated you are completley forgotten, while they chit-chat with each other
We were there early and the restaurant was not even half full
Our presence seemed to be a nuisance to them
We couldn't get their attention, they couldn't answer questions about the food, and they were basically unavailable throughout our meal
The atmosphere is OK, the food is average, and there are so many other restaurants nearby
why would you need to go here?!
Some of the dishes here are OK; some are not
Recently was there when the restaurant was not busy
Waited over 30mins for our pasta dishes
Our orders had obviously been forgotten
Even though the staff realized this, as others arriving 15 minutes after us were being served their entrees, they ignored us
We had to ask for bread and water while we sat and waited and waited
Finally, our meals came, and the pasta was undercooked! That's a 30 minute wait for undercooked pasta while being ignored by the wait staff
Needless to say, would definitely not go back
Did not get a chance to savour the supposed delights of this place
We requested an outside table and was told it would be half an hour
While we waited just outside the picket fence we noticed two groups of newcomers who were seated ahead of us
When we raised this with the maitre'd he said that he had forgotten about us but offered no apology
Needless to say we left
Poetessa is a jewel in a neighborhood that's a bit overrun with average Italian restaurants
Outstanding food (short ribs are so tender you can cut them with a fork -- easily the best I've ever had)
Service is good, although the staff do tend to push the more expensive wines, albeit subtlely
Lovely
We are going to be regulars at this very charming Italian restaurant, the artichoke fava beans salad was superb, my girlfriend had the Spaghetti carbonara '' with authentic Italian Pancetta'' to die for
Our waiter was very friendly and the ambiances also cool with nice music
Very Inexpensive, if you like Italian food you have to try it
POETESSA's outdoor cafe right on Second Ave is open! Seafood risotto, mixed salad, and a glass of wine in the springtime air in NYC

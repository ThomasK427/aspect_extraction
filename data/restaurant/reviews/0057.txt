After eating at 34th street for 6 years, the last time my wife and I went, we asked for a booth and we were told we couldn't have one for only two people
Bear in mind this was a Tuesday and it was nearly 2/3 empty
All of the booths were also empty except for one (with two people in it)
The hostess was very snotty and then the manager made such a big production out of it (you could tell he thought he was managing China Grille on a Saturday night), that we have decided not to go back until they are both gone, which should not be long given the succession of staff
I always thought the food was decent, but not spectacular and the price fair, but no bargain
When you trade out a friendly staff for a hostile one, I'm done
While the drink specials and food at Blockheads are good and can be a deal, I would think twice before venturing to this establishment
The waiters and waittress appear nice and friendly, but get so swamped that they neglect you after awhile and you end up waiting for drinking and refills on chips and salsa
My worst experience ever was when my friends and I went there for happy hour and were charged for drinks we didn't have
We paid the full bill (including the 20% gratuity--which was not deserved), minus 43 cents
The waiter came back asking for the 43 cents!!! I'm not kidding! Upon discussing this with the waiter and manager nothing was resolved
I gave the guy 50 cents since it seemed to make such a difference to him and he took it! So sad
I love this place
The chips and salsa are great
and so is the service, always very very nice and friendly! The frozen drinks are WAY too sweet, but for $3 over lunch, who cares!!!! Great Price!
This is a light, casual yummy Cali-Mexican place
They have fantastic salsa, entrees specials make great Margaritas
Even Better, on weekends they serve brunch until 4:00pm with never-ending chapagne, mimosa, orange juice, or other breakfast beverages
Being from California having this type of brunch everywhere - it's great to have found a bright sunny spot in Manhatton that feels like my Cali-beach town
I went here for lunch and was pleasantly suprised
The food, particlarly the oft-neglected salsa, was very fresh and portions were a decent size
The atmosphere was fun and if you sit by the window, there is a lot of people-watching to be had! Avoid the flavored margaritas though--too sweet
Blockheads is the kind of place every neighborhood should have - cheap, friendly and reliable
It's not going to win any awards for its decor, but the food is good, the portions are big, and the prices are low
I've taken many different groups of friends here and everyone has always had a good time
They have great happy hour specials and a roofdeck in the summer
Came here for brunch on a Sunday - chips and salsa were passable - salsa didn't taste fresh
The breakfast burritos were average
Fill up on the unlimited mimosas and you won't notice the difference
Unlike most reviews I have done this location I visited only once
The salsa was fresh and homemade
The tacos where better others I've had in NYC
The place is most like the little dives I have frequented in Mexico than anything I have seen in NY
Basically the comfort is lacking but the food is the focus
I was meeting with my cousin who I hadn't seen in a long time and we were in search of a Mexican restaurant
We ended up at Blockhead's and it was an extremely enjoyable experience
The food was delicious and plentiful, the service was good (helpful recommendations), and the price was very reasonable
We were able to sit and talk for over an hour without being rushed out, however I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you're in a rush
I do recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants a quiet, well-priced, high quality meal
Great burritos - lots of unique items and vegetarian options
Large portions, quick service
I'll definitely be going back!
Yuckity Yuck Yuck  The Burritos were horrible but the Sangria was decent
That's about it
I can't even remember what the food was like, after experiencing the worst service of my life
If you're looking for the dark, staid, woodsy Cafe Aubette on 27th Street, forget it
The boys from PS450 and Punch Judy have swooped in and completely redone the place as only they can
Now a sleek, cool lounge with refreshing new color, lighting and surfaces, Fig 27 mirrors its around the corner sibling, PS450 with a yummy menu of small bites, great drinks and wonderful staff
The dead wood from Aubette is gone in more ways than one! You'll find classic PS450 dishes like the sliced steak atop creamed spinich on crunchy little toasts and new items like brie poppers on drizzled strawberry-infused sauce
So when the crowds at PS are just too much to take, head south a few blocks to this welcome addition to the hood
And yes, those hunky managers do make appearances!
What an awful night! Despite the cosy, relaxed ambience, the service was the worst I've ever experienced
What dreadfully rude arrogant people - shocking!
Simply one of my favorite places in New York! The is a simple elegance to this place I really love
Simply one of my favorite places
A nice blend of eclectic experiences
As a Chef in an Italian restaurant, I encourage you to steer clear of this trap
The following all occured when a dinnermate and I stopped in for two courses and a drink: -Featured Cocktail Melon Martini was unavailable -Pinot Grigio from surprisingly short list of wines by the glass served with a healthy bit of cork -Appetizer of Clams and Mussels poorly executed: Garlic poorly sliced and not sauteed, sauce underseasoned and watery, and devoid of butter or olive oil to even out sauce's natural acidity, clams poorly cleaned, leaving sand in the mouth -Tortellini al Forno oversauced with unremarkable rose sauce, no evidence of baking, unmistakable texture of frozen tortellini product -Ravioli La Fenice lazily rendered: garlic and shallots sauce base crunchy and sharp (under cooked): fresh spinach over cooked: sauce watery and under seasoned: Filling dense and unseasoned: Hair melted into cheese on top -Parpedelle with Bolognaise ordered to replace ravioli: oversauced
Sauce undercheesed, under herbed, underseasoned, under loved; pasta overcooked -Coffee surprisingly bad, and served with hot milk: unique in my experience outside of ordering cafe au lait in Paris and New Orleans
A bright spot: the server was immeadiately apologetic and whisked problem plates away, and replacements were prompt
When the bill came, there were no comps, despite numerous problems
Never was any management at the table to inquire after problems or concerns
Our experience consistently reflected a lazy attitude by the house towards cooking technique and customer care
Avoid
The lasagna, seafood salad, and pasta were all very good
My friend had a seafood platter dish, and we both agreed that it was very fresh
Food and wine prices were quite reasonable in NY considering the location, quality, and ambience
For around 40$ a person, a great value find in NY
This restaurant gives you the feeling of a tourist trap - Not only that the food is bad, they also charged us $4
50 for two thin slices of fetta cheese we requested on top of the salad
And on top of everything, they added the tip (18%) to our check although we were only 4 people and not a large group, as if they knew nobody will give them a cent more than 15% if it wasn't included in the check
WE WOULD NEVER GO THERE AGAIN
This restaurant is a rare find in NYC
I live there and find most places are overpriced and a disappointment
La Fenice is neither, they have decent prices for NYC and the food is excellent
The staff is always there to help you and if you are not happy with what you order, quick to give you something else
The menu has salads and moderately priced pasta from $11-19 ,which is so rare in this city
Didn't try dessert but it looked great too
I will go there whenever Im in the neighborhood
This is a great pre or post Lincoln Center dinner
The wait staff is very charming (especially if you are female) and very helpful when trying to decide between all the mouth-watering selections
The papardelle is delicious (and freshly made) and the mussels/clams appetizer is definitely worth a try!!
Three of us were sitting outside, and the unbelievably obnoxious waiter refused to keep the restaurant canopy down over us, even though we and our food were continually getting dripped on with dirty water from an air-conditioner higher up on the building
We had to coax the staff four times to put the canopy over us, and then after they finally did it, 2 minutes later they pulled it up again!  We even offered to change our seats but they were unresponsive!  They pulled the cloth napkin right out of my friend's lap(!) when she only ordered cappucino instead of a full meal (which she had told them in advance that she was doing) and they said she could only have a paper napkin
We are life-long NYers and we've gotten better treatment by velvet-rope nightclub bouncers than we got at this place!
In this place we ( my wife and me) had the best pasta and a wonderfull service you can ever imagine in the whole New York
The food is incredibly tasting and, if you want an advice: Grill calamari, Rigatoni a la vodka and, for dessert, Tartufata
AH!!!, the price excelent, no expensive
This is probably the best Italian restaurant I've been to
They have probably the second best Vodka sauce I've had (first one being a seafood restaurant in Baltimore) with third place being way way behind second
Even after I was done eating, every single dish smelled SOOO unbelievably good and my mouth would water even though my tummy was full
The tiramisu was very good here too
Very light and although a little heavy in the liqueur--it was still light enough that I could finish the whole thing by myself
I would DEFINITELY go to this cute Upper West Side Italian place again
This place is Italian, not French
After looking for a place to eat before a show at Lincoln Center, we wandered into this intimate little Italian place on Broadway
We started with some drinks: an ice cold Peroni and some wine
The salads were amazing in themselves - mixed greens andtomato wedges in a delicious balsamic vinagrette with slices of Italian bread with warm goat cheese
One of the specials was Chilean sea bass in a white wine and light tomato broth, with clams, mussels and mushrooms and a side of linguine in the same sauce
It was exquisite

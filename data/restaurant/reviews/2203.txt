I recomend it for any occasion
if you have the $$$$
It is expensive, but it's well worth it!
Expecting better, we were very disappointed in both quality of food and service
The waiter recommended we order a round of appetizers for the table which came out to 8 dishes for over $100!!!! Plus, wine list was not too impressive
This is nothing but tourist trap crap
For real steak, stick with Luger's or Sparks
One more reason to avoid chain restaurants
If you love steak than this is the place! Your steak eating experience will climb to the top after dinning here! Take clients, friends, and even loved ones
A+++++++
Five star
Four Diamond!
solid place
solid steaks
good atmosphere and friendly service
def recommended
If you live in Jersey, there is a Ruth'c Chris by the Lincoln Tunnel
You'll save yourself parking, toll and traffic
Deciding that it was time to take a break from being a vegetarian I had Ruth's Chris in mind for a night of 'sin'
I had the Petite Filet-not wanting to shock my system
The meat lacked the taste my nose had hoped for
I knew asking for the A-1 was out of the question so I dealt with it
They sat myself us in the back of the restaurant-away from the noise that I hadn't expected of the dimly lit restaurant
Argubly the best seat in the house-we did feel castaway
Great wine selection, good desert, but the friendly service would warrant another trip
Hey its better than Sizzlers!
I've been to many great steakhouses and this was the worst experience I have ever had
I took my father who was visiting me for what I thought would be a great quality dinner
The filets were extremely greasy, not buttery and juicy
The filet and appetizers tasted like TGI Friday's quality
After the great reviews, I was extremly dissapointed
I will not venture from Palm Steakhouse to visit Ruth's Chris again! I could have cooked a better steak myself
The only positive was the nice ambiance
Went to Ruth's Chris Steak House last night and it was absolutely delicious
This was the 3rd time my husband went - once in Pittsburgh and the other in Cancun
All were great
I would highly recommend this place
The steak melts in your mouth
I especially like the garlic mashed potatoes, while my husband enjoys the au gratin
We brought my parents there - and they absolutely loved it! Will continue to go! PS - The service was excellent!
I was very impressed!! This was absolutely the best steakhouse I have ever been to
The butter was sizzling on the steak when they brought it out
The staff really worked hard to make sure everything was perfect
Even the manager, as busy as I'm sure he was, came over to ask how our meal was
You don't see that much anymore
I would stongly recommend Ruth Chris' to anyone visiting New York
yum
very good food
a wonderful server
great wine list
what more could you want? what a delight!
This is my top #1 steakhouse! I don't care if some think it may be over-hyped, because I have been to ALL the steakhouses and their steak does melt in your mouth and is the best! The smell of pink rare steak cooking in hot sizzling butter
what more can I say?
Tried a Peter Luger's style preparation on a cut of meat
They failed dismally
While Peter Luger's dishes also come out swimming in butter, their's actually tastes good
And when I ask for medium rare, I mean medium rare, not raw (although I do love the occasional Steak Tartare)
Their side dishes were the only saving grace (I think it was a sauteed mushroom dish or something to do with mushrooms)
It certainly wasn't a memorable event and I'm a very hearty meat eater, too
Service was acceptable though nothing to write home to Mom about--I've had better
For these prices, I could eat at a number of better steakhouses like Ben Benson's
We look for quality of food, atmosphere
service, location amp; value
Ruth's Chris had all of the above
Wonderfully romantic interior, attenive, helpful amp; timely service amp; our dinners were done to perfection( flavorful amp; plentiful)
Priced in line with other Manhattan steakhouses
Give them a try
You won't regret it
The best steak I have ever had
I have been to the Tarrytown location and it is even better if you can believe it
I was a little worried after reading a couple shakey reviews
please
This is a truely wonderful place, and yes, the steaks are better than Lugers, anyday
This was my first time and I was quite pleased with the food
The service was pretty good and quick
The ambience was pleasent and upscale
I would definately recommend the restaurant to a friend or client
If I had only one crtical remark to make
It would be, that the restaurant could have been maybe a little warmer since this was our first time and we were taking guests to impress
But, overall it was favorable
A little overpriced but we will absolutely go again and again and again
The four girlfriends went on a girls night out and it was oh so better than sex
Food was great
The busboy was wonderful
When we were all done we needed a cigarette!!!
Steaks were just okay and overpriced, but the atmosphere is very relaxing and the service was good
I cant lie, the food was pretty good, but I was disappointed at the serving sizes especially after reading their menu and promises of family size portions
I recommend the creme brule
That was my highlight for the evening
I went to the restaurant in Weehawken, NJ
The waiter was overly enthusiastic and basically sold us a bill of goods
Steaks were mediocre, certainly not prime meat and probably not even aged
It was all a disappointment after hearing so many ads in the past
Prices as high as all other steak places
In Short Benihana started out as a tiny four-table restaurant in New York City's theater district before becoming an international chain
Diners sit around large tables where chefs ostentatiously chop, slice, stir-fry and grill
Entree options are simple--shrimp, chicken, steak and scallops--and preparation is uniform
Every entree comes with a similar stock of sides: green tea, rice, onion soup, shrimp appetizer, iceberg lettuce drizzled with dressing and sauteed vegetables
They cooked the food in front of us with a very entertaining chef who cracked loads of funny jokes
i had the shrimp and file minon

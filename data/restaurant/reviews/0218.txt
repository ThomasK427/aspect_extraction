First, we were seated at a broken table
Upon moving us to another place, they forgot to give us butter and water
I am not picky about such stuff, but this place claims to be a high-end steakhouse/seafood restaurant
Now, the entrees were what completely spoiled our night
I do not know if asking for 32$ veal/venison chops well-done means: bloody inside, charcoal outside, but that is what we got
Burnt beyond recognition, camouflaged with overly strong sauces
Though the mashed potatoes side was excellent, it could not help my and my wife's feeling of having rocks in our stomachs until mid next day
I guess charcoal is hard to digest
Venison from Millbrook, Duck from Long Island, Catskill Trout, Little Necks, and the list goes on and on
Kudos to Waldy Malouf for incorporating NY's bountiful harvest into the delectable menu at Beacon
As a NYer and Marist College Alumn, its great to see the Hudson Valley get its due, but its even better to taste it
The meals at Beacon are portioned just right and there is always something that I want and that my girlfriend wants
Good for friends, family as well as clients
Validated parking is a HUGE plus
The alcoholic milkshake that is served with one of the chocolate desserts was pretty good
The food was OK, but out of 10 us who went there, 4 became ill with an adverse reaction around Xmas time
Read into that what you will
The place is darker than I prefer, I like to enjoy the colours of a good plate presentation
Having a lavatory attendant in the men's room was a bit of a peeve as well
It has been my pleasure to visit Beacon several times at different seasons over the past few years
The quality of the food, atmosphere and professionalism of the staff is constant
I highly recommend Beacon to anyone that enjoys excellent atmosphere, food and outstanding cocktails
Compliments to Chef Waldy Malouf!
What else can you say but Waldy Malouf
His Food and ambience sets you it the right mood
You walk out of there feeling like you just a the meal of your life
Staff very friendly and Chef make's his presence
Go there hungry leave satified
I have eaten at Beacon twice in the past year, in two different seasons, to try different menus
I found that everything there is fabulous
There were no problems or slowness, and the one night I was in a rush to the theater, my food was served quickly and still with high quality
Their meat dishes are fabulous, extremely tender and cooked to perfection
Your server is always close by, and they can sense if someone is unsatisfied or has a question
And the bathrooms? Tres cool and trendy!
Food was good, especially our fire grilled pizza
Ambience is fine, although the rooms are somewhat dark for my taste
They don't appear to have anything to hide, especially with an open kitchen, so light a couple of candles! Service was friendly but somewhat slow
Our waiter appeared somewhat overworked and had to be reminded about several items regarding our order
Drinks and steaks were excellent but the mushrooms were so salty as to be inedible
Wine list was broad without being pretentious
management was helpful and pleasant
The portions a very large
Altogether a good experience and I would recomment Beacon to friends
Sorry, SaveYourMoney, you must've been there on a VERY off day! I've been dining at Beacon since 2 weeks after it opened, and after many dinners, I can truthfully say that everything on the menu is sublime! Even when the chef is not in the house, the food and service are right on target
Since I cook for a living, I'm very fussy about the food I eat in restaurants
Chef Waldy's always measures up
Be sure to try the Smoked Trout
Lamb Chops, Veal Chops, Rabbit, the potato gratin, on and on and on
This restaurant is characterized by 2 stories of tables with a bar located downstairs right by the entrance
The wait staff will attend to your every wish with style and grace
The menu can give you price shock but the food, service and drinks are worth every stinking penny
This is perfect for business dinners or pre-theatre dining but NOT romantic at all
The dining areas are pretty noisy and tables are very close together
Not to be rude, but my entire family and I were very unimpressed with this restaurant
The prices are ridiculous! Completely off the wall for very mediocore food
We went in a party of 10 and I don't think one person enjoyed their dish
My aunt's steak had to be cooked three times until it was satisfactory
Restaurants like this one give dining in Manhattan a bad name
Please look into going somewhere else
Anyone who gave this place a decent review does not know food at all
This restaurant is sort of bland
Everyone was very nice and friendly and relaxed
The food came out pretty fast and the waitress was very attentive
I had the trout which was bland and my friend had the Salmon which was delicious
I had the haggis which was fabulous and my friend had the Caesar salad which was nothing much
For dessert we had sticky toffee pudding, the most delicious thing on earth
Order it
The bill was $108 which is very reasonable
The wait staff very nice
Ribeye steak was very tough, would never ordered it again
Friends had the ribs and lamb, which was good
Creamed spinach was excellent as was the raw bar
I would not make it a regular stomping ground but would go back
I first went on a Thursday night
Up front is more of a pub and the back is the nice dining room
My glass was empty for all of 3 seconds before the lady asked if I'd like another and the food was amazing (try the trout!)
The people were friendly and you wouldn't believe the scotch list! It's bigger than the menu!
Oh the prices were great too - it's right near times square so you'd think you'd be gouged but I swear it's cheaper than one of those crappy chain restaurants but with (like I said in the title) great food and great service
The place was full pre-theatre but I didn't feel rushed and if you go after theatre starts you get a fairly quiet dining room
The staff actually answers questions you might have, knowledgably! I left feeling happy and full
Just got back from having my Mum's 50th birthday celebration at St
Andrews
She is Scottish, and so is my godfather, and wanted a taste of what she grew up with
First of all, the service was fantastic
They were all very kind and knowledgeable
Everything we ordered came out fast and fresh
The food was delicious - we all tried something different but several of us had the prix fixe and it was a great deal
I'm so glad we went - we did make reservations before hand since we were a large party, but our table at the front gave us a good view of all the walk-ins who didn't get seated, so make a reservation soon!
Went here based on Citysearch recommendations, but service was slow and they jecked up the price of the prix fixed menu that was posted outside by adding $2 more to begin with and then extra for the coffee that was supposed to be included
After many years living in St Andrews, Scotland, it's great to find a little corner of Fife transplanted to Broadway
The restaurant in the back is excellent (esp
the salmon) but pricey
I prefer the top-notch pub grub in the bar
The haggis isn't authentic (not nearly enough fat), but some would say that's a good thing!
This Scottish bar is like any other bar as far as food is concerned-average
I'll even go one further and say there isn't much room in their dining area
Go in, grab a stool and enjoy the great beer selection or any of their single malt scotches
Both their beer list and their Scotch list go beyond 100 count
That, served by a man in a kilt that ain't just wearing a uniform! Great place for a real drinker
The food was great, maybe a bit pricey but not too bad

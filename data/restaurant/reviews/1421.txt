I have live in the UWS for 10 years and this place has exceed all expectations
I hear that they got a new chef and the food was great
I went with a group of 6 and every plate was beautiful and flavorful
The wine list has lots of choices and with many of them under $50
The only complaint was that when it gets very busy they should crank up the ac
Word in the Restaurant is they just got a new Chef-  Well then please, keep looking! I've been offended with the time it takes to get the first dish, if you get it at all
what is worth that wait? And perhaps we can get a muzzle for the bartender while we're fixing things
We went there with my mother, at her request, for Mother's Day and were thrilled
This was one of the top 20 meals I've ever eaten
Wonderful wine list, great service, fabu skate, rabbit and lamb and the deserts blew us away, esp the key lime brulee
Highly recommend going with more than one person so you can sample bits of everything
Too bad I didn't bring my mother in law here earlier in the day
I'll be back for the $25 dollar meal in a heartbeat!
It is about time the Upper Westside had and adult restaurant / wine bar
The food and wine are delicious and the staff is friendly and down to earth
Yes, the space is a little tight, but the extensive wine list, tasty food, and good service make up for it
The prices are on the higher side for the dishes that are served, but overall this is a nice restaurant for the UWS
Finally, the Upper West Side has an intimate, smart dining spot for neighborhood afficianados instead of tourists
The food which ranges from a vegetarian platter served on a bed of wild rice to venison, New York strip steak and wonderfully inventive fish dishes
The prices are very reasonable, the wine list is sophisticated and the service on the night I was there was attentive without being intrusive
The hostess was particularly charming
We will become regulars
While the food was delicious and the service good, the atmosphere leaves much to be desired and the pricing is out of whack for the experience
Tight spacing in the front room leaves diners feeling like they are sitting on the divider of an interstate, ambiance/decor is at odds with the prices being charge, and waits of up to 30 minutes occur on reservations
Not bad, but would not recommend
Warm and inviting atmosphere
The staff are all extremely friendly
Most importantly, the food was excellent
Items you must try include the spinach salad, the scallops and the NY strip steak
The onion rings are the best
The warm chocolate bread pudding is fabulous, and I don't even like bread pudding! I highly recommend this restaurant
I plan on returning in the very near future
This restaurant bubbles with charm and good fellowship
The hostess seated us immediately and our drinks arrived at our table exactly when we did
The crab cake appetizers were succulent and the fish I had and the venison my wife ordered were tender and moist
And oh, those fried onions! Magnificent
I could hear everything my dinner companions said to me which is a rarity in some restaurants
Unfortunately, the desserts were so delicious we finished every bite and we'll have to start our diets all over again
We will become regulars at this lovely upper west side small, but cozy spot
The food is delicious, the ambience is chic and the service is extremely attentive
I love the grilled vegetables on a bed of wild rice and the pineapple roasted in rum with coconut sorbet is a heavenly desert
This neighborhood spot is the place to be on the upper west side
Eating here is like being at a cozy, friendly British pub only the food is better
don't waste your time - the place is smaller than a NYC apt and they obviously cannot handle the recent press they have received
wish i could tell you about the food but left prior to sitting down after waiting 20 mins to look over a below par wine list and being bumped into several times by the inexperienced wait staff and host
two major thumbs down - small resturants can be fun but only if they are run well and there is some atmosphere
pair of 8's adds up to one big zero
I've been back to this cozy restaurant ever since i've had my first taste of it~ My favourite dishes include the crab cake, calamari salad, new york strip steak (Oooo the onion strings on the side are soo delicious), and the venison is a specialty that my friend loves!! (watchout for the sweet potatoe puree, its great!)  Wait wait, not over yet, i couldn't end this without praising their dessert menu!! I personally think that their Chocolate bread pudding, Lemon cheesecake, and their pumpkin pot de la creme could be noted as the unbeatable trio!! All 3 are s i m p l y delicious!!  Overall, it's a place with a nice ambience, good for small or big parties, and terrific service!! (the wines are at reasonably priced too~)
I recently tried the new restaurant on Amsterdam near 88th street and have since gone back a couple of times
The food is excellent, I especially enjoyed the Sauted Spinach and onion string sides and the Roast Chicken and Vennison were two of the excellent entrees I enjoyed as well
There's a good selection of wines and they offered suggestions as to which new (to me) wines would go well with my meals
Overall a very pleasant dining experience
Highly recommended
It is great to9 have a reasonable high quality restaurant on the upper west side
Paor of 8's has great food and an interesting wine list
It is a comfortable and pretty place to eat or grab a drink at the bar
The food at this place is great, no doubt
The price is moderate
The service is a little on the rude side
Still, recommended if you like south Indian food
I discovered the original Pongal on Lex and 27th a few years ago, and it quickly became my favorite Indian restaurant
I was so pleased to learn the Pongal team had opened another restaurant on the UES, within walking distance of my apartment!  My favorite dish is the onion rava masala -- like a huge, crispy pancake filled with delectable morsels
The other standard Indian classics, such as the chana masala and the saag paneer are fantastic, too
Get the masala tea for dessert (like a chai at Starbucks but a million times better)
Everything is very fresh, with none of that overwhelming aroma/spice you'll find in many Indian restaurants
Don't come here expecting anything fancy
The atmosphere is only ok and the service is so-so
It is wonderfully cheap, though!
The red velvet are marvelous too, better than Buttercup's red velvet
Good coffee too
I was intoduced to the Little Cupcake Bakeshop thru a friend who brought cupcakes to a party we were attending
When she told us where they were from, we were like Bay Ridge??? Being that we live on Staten Island, it's not often that we got to that neck of the woods
None of us knew there even was a cupcake shop there
We all just assumed they were from some place in the city
But let me tell you, these cupcakes were such a huge hit, needless to say there were none left over, even the cute pink boxes they were in were nowhere to be found
OK
That was like 2 months ago, now 5 pounds later, it seems like we cant get enough of this place
My biggest mistake was visiting the shop because now it's so hard to stay away from it
the red velvet was to die for
The cupcakes at this giant doll/gingerbread house over at 91st and 3rd are awesome
Since theyve opened, everyone I know has been raving about this place
It's sooo cute and adorable you just want to take it home with you
The dessert is simply the best I've had in a long time
Being a native New Yorker, I've probably been to every cupcake bakery in this city, but nobody tops this place
It's too bad I live 20 minutes by car from here, but a few coworkers of mine have done the honorable deed of bringing these delicious cupcakes to work
It's like we cant be without them
hehe
Save your money and just buy a box of Betty Crocker cake mix
These cupcakes taste like old, DRY cake mix from the box
I have tried their cupcakes and cakes several times and every time I was disappointed
They may look good, but they definitely don't taste fresh baked!
After reading about the Little Cupcake shop in an article, I decided to give them a shot
Being that I live in Manahattan
it's kind of a treck to get out there just to eat cakes when I have so many choices here in the city
But let me tell you, the cupcakes were so delicious, i really think thses are the best so far
I would definetly recomend anyone to this place
The look and feel were also so inviting, it's likeme and my friends did not want to leave
The cakes were great, the coffee was awesome
The only negative if there is one has to be that I got a parking ticket while there!
A jumbled-up mess

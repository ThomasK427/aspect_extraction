And the restaurant was about as 'authentic japanese' as mickey dees
Dont fall for the obviously planted reviews like I did
My friend and I went to Raku before a show and had a great time! After reading so many positive reviews and I must admit to being a bit skeptical but after visiting I can see why this place has such high marks
I will say upfront I'm not a huge sushi fan like my friend is but she was quite impressed
Even as a sushi novice, I enjoyed all that I ate
Ray and the staff are exactly as so many others have pointed out here, genuinely interested in what we thought, what we liked, what we didn't like
He came and sat down with us and had us try the milky sake but neither of us cared much for it
He did sell us on some plum wine however! Very nice aftertaste
Next time you're in Times Square and in a sushi mood, give Raku a try
Went to Raku on Friday night and can't say enough! Not an expert when it comes to sushi, but with the help of Ray (the manager) I had an amazing dining experince
I tried things I never thought I would
The sushi was sooo delicious and fresh
I would highly recommend this place to anyone who has always been afraid to take a chance with sushi
Ray and his friendly staff will guide you through !
We were first time visitors to NYC and read the great reviews so decided to try Raku
It lived up to its brilliant reputation and more
Unrivaled service and first class food, for a group of novice sushi eaters
We are now converted,but will have problems matching up to the sushi we had at Raku! Not to mention the saki
My friend and I were looking for a quick sushi dinner before seeing a Broadway show
Ruby Foos and Blue Fin were booked so we tried this new, quaint restaurant in the theater district
We eat sushi all the time and this place blew us away
The rolls were interesting and the portions were large
Fresh sushi and great service makes this one of my new favorite sushi spots!
Visited Raku last weekend with my boyfriend on a chilly New York night
Ray (the owner and exceptional host!) walked us through the entire menu
Atmosphere was cozy and warm, our waitress was ever-present but not hovering and the sushi tasted like it was fresh from the morning catch
(In fact, Ray pointed out exactly which pieces had been selected just that morning!) We felt like friends of the chef by the time we left -- not to mention our bellies were full! Try the white dragon roll (and ask for tips on the best tasting method), lobster or scallops and the tri-colored wasabi roll
I took my wife to be there last night and we have always loved sushi
But being the young couple that we are we only get to go out on special occasions
The food was perfect
Really the best we have tasted and we've been to dozens of Sushi rest
Furthermore it is right next to time square so it is very easy to get to
Ray is great
Helped us pic out some new Sushi and also found us our first Sake that we really love
thanks ray and everyone at Raku
My wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere of your restaurant and would recommend it to any couple
It was both quite and romantic
thank you
PS your recommendation of the white dragon roll was excellent
This little place has become my favorite spot for sushi
The food was top notch, the service was great and the manager is extremely concerned with customer satisfaction
great CRM!  I will definitely be going back for the great sushi and Ray, the manager, lets me know he appreciates my business
If you want to know why this place has so many reviews, go and see for yourself!
probably the best sushi i have ever had
The manager came over to us while we were having difficulty ordering, and very helpfully explained everything
he got us to try things that we never had, it was all excellent
i highly recommend Raku to anyone in nyc
There are an awful lot of reviews on here which were posted within a very short period of time - all of which are incredibly positive!  There weren't very many people in there when we arrived but it began to fill up when the theaters let out
The service ranged from overbearing to absent
Sushi was avarage
I just can't rave about it as much as the other people here
I love great sushi and love going to a restaurant where I feel like I am at home
At Raku, not only is the sushi fresh delectable, the service is warm friendly the owner took the time to get to know me my friends personally
I have been back several times with various friends business associates
I always feel like a VIP recommend Raku to everyone whether it's casual, a special date or to impress a business associate - this is a nice find! Don't forget to try the cold unfiltered 'milky' sake! You'll feel really good afterwards!!
If you like supermarket sushi or regularly get sushi from a chinese restaurant, don't go to Raku because you probably don't really like raw fish
I've eaten sushi and sashimi all over the NY / Long Island area, and this place has, by far, the freshest and softest fish around
The wait staff is fast and nice as well
One of my favorite lunch places -- don't imagine it would get any worse for dinner
GO THERE NOW IF YOU REALLY LIKE SUSHI!
I've eaten at Raku 4 times after discovering it last month, and each time the fish was exceptional and the service fantastic
The sashimi is soft as butter, and probably the freshest I've ever had
The portions are generous, and the prices are quite reasonable for any sushi joint, let alone for one right off Times Square!   Salad and miso soup (best miso around) are on your table straight after you order, and your teacup will never be left empty for long
Sometimes you may have to wait for the fish, but it's clear that the chefs take their time because they're experts, and not because they're overworked
The owner is very friendly and eager to get you to come back -- ask to get your fish card stamped, if you don't mind that his business cards are stuck together!
After finding Raku on Citysearch in September 2003 and 4 visits from Northern California later, I enjoy every visit
The delicious, fresh and consistent quality of the Sashimi, ample portions, friendly atmosphere, reasonable price, and convenience to Times Square and mid-town, makes me a frequent guest
I continually recommend Raku to friends, family and coworkers
The food was absolutely delicious! We had a Crazy Dragon Roll, a Maki Maki Roll, and a Raku Special Roll
I highly recommend the Crazy Dragon Roll, it combines two of my favorites (Spicy Tuna and Eel) with avacado
The food is always of the best quality
It's one of my favorite restaurants ever
I would recommend Raku for anyone who's passing through Times Square!
when we moved to midtown - we were looking for a nice neighborhood sushi place to have our friday lunches
How happy were we when we found Ray and Raku
The sushi is fresh, lunch specials give you choices ! Ray introduced us to unfiltered sake - which was so yummy
The staff is friendly and kind, one really feels like you are in a small neighborhood place because they remember you when you come back
Go see for yourself
Raku had a slight blip in service due to a shortage of wait staff, but the situation was quickly remedied
The food is excellent -- wonderfully fresh sushi, creative rolls
Ambiance is pleasant and comfortable without being too casual
We will definitely go back again
Excellent milk saki!
my friends and i were going to see a play across from raku and figured for convenience and time, we would eat there
best choice we ever made! the sushi was fresh and delicious
we ate quick so we did not get a chance to try all the special rolls they had, have to come back
don't know what smiley suni was talking about, we would recommend this place
also, raku has been around for a year not a month, as per the owner
no wonder they survived, they're worth the visit!
This comfortably sized restaurant is hidden in the theatre district of Times Square
The food was absolutely amazing! Their selection of sushi would fulfill any craving one might have
And the fish they used was as fresh as catching it yourself
The owner and his staff were very accomodating and polite
It was raining hard when I got there and they offered to seat me and wait for the rest of my party
On top of that, the owner had given us complimentary milk sake, sake you won't find anywhere else
A great concoction indeed! You'll be missing out on a great meal if you walk by this door
:)
I have been to Raku about 3 times now when I am in town from Seattle where I enjoy eating a lot of fine Sushi
Raku was a nice find, the Albacore, hamachi,Maguro, Unagi, and ebi where pretty good and the service was excellent!  I enjoyed a nice conversation with the manager who even let me sample some unfiltered Sake which was great!  So if you are mid-town on Business I would recommend Raku for Sushi
I use to live in NYC in circa 1993 and would eat Sushi 6 days a week, I can say that Raku is a great combination of value/service in mid town

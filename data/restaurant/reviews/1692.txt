And the best thing: the prices are affordable for everybody
I hope they will keep it up!!
Orologio makes from great dining
Good food and good people watching
A refined restaurant at great prices
Very tasty meals
A great place for 1, 2 or 10 people to have dinner
Great service, food and scenery
In Short This East Village 24-hour eatery is equal parts diner dive, hipster hangout and old-style Russian staple
Not glitzy, but generous, it remains a warm, inexpensive oasis on the continuously gentrifying Avenue A
The menu reads like a diner in Odessa: kasha varnishkes, blintzes, borscht and more cabbage incarnations than you can count
One of the better and more popular options in the lower east side of Manhattan is Odessa, if you can excuse their so-so service and noisy interior
The food was average, but good for late night standards as was the price
Inside, the diner is typical of a regular diner with booths, counters, and tables
Each was full of customers, loud and rowdy from all the late night festivities most likely, but what really killed our experience was one of the rudest waitresses I've encountered during my dining experience here in NYC
It was a rushed meal and attentiveness was not there for this particular night
I will have to think twice about going here again
Actually there are TWO Odessas, next door neighbors
One is the original from the  60s(?)
It's run down, divey looking and not crowded
The other is more modern with bright lighting and more of a roadside diner feel
The specialty food (NOT Russian, more Jewish/Polish) is good and plentiful
You'll take some home
The service is NY style friendly
with enough joking rudeness and try the Kielbasa, but what do I know I'm Greek to please the fussiest out-of-towner
Our group had a ball
--Eat Club is a roving NYC group of gluttons
They really have the best food
I feel the need to stick up for Odessa since everyone always passes it by because it looks like a diner, with a bunch of old men hanging at the counter drinking coffee
The service is excellent, the food is great and the price is cheap
I ate borscht as my entire meal, since it is so good there, simple yet delicious
Drink some of their wine and it tastes even better
My friend had the beef and egg noodles, which even to a non-meaty like myself, I had to admit was good
And I think they bake their own sweet bread, it was quite tasty with the soup
The portions are huge, though
Save room for all those tasty cakes behind the counter
Odessa is open 24/7, so it's a good place to swing in at 3/4am to get some breakfast foods
You will have a mix of BT, villagers, and low lifes
the food is alright, not that hard to make an omlete
I would stay away from any food that isn't easy to make
On the plus side, you can have one more beer with that toast of yours
They serve booze
This place gets crowded once the bars start to close
It was a casual environment with a mixed crowd and an excellent place to go to meet your friends before bar hopping, but not to hook up with anyone
THIS is my idea of comfort food
Stuffed cabbage and piergoies when I want something rich/ the mediterranean salad when I need something light
They'll never win any awards for the food, but there's really nothing to complain about either
The standard diner fare is good, but the Eastern European dishes are the best
The pierogies, potato pancakes and stuffed cabbage are consistently fresh and delicious (and pretty cheap)
Food is good anytime of the day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner
Pretty cheap considering other places in the neighborhood
They also have a really good brunch menu on the weekends
I love the steak and eggs with a bloody mary that costs around $7 bucks
Odessa's is one of the best places for breakfast no matter what time of day you eat it
The homefries are delicious
Your food seems to be almost immediately brought to you
It is great
I love this place
It's decorated in deep red, with victorian type sofas and chairs
Very rich and plush
Mirrored ceilings, paintings, ornate
The staff is just wonderful - attentive when you need something, but they pretty much leave you alone to talk to your friends and enjoy the food
I've always came here after dinner: the coffee is outstanding and their dessert crepes amazing
Then we decided to eat there for once and we hit ourselves for not doing so earlier: amazing food, tasty and plentiful
Vegetarians and meat-eaters can find something on the menu
Their French Onion soup has a meat-free stock, and it's amazing
Their potato salad is phemonenal
Try this place, you won't be disappointed
I love the way this place looks, feels and sounds
I've been going for years and it's still high on my list
It's a little pricier than you'd expect, but the food has definite benefits, even though sometimes it's like playing a roulette wheel
They're menu hasn't really changed in a while, but what used to be their specials were really scrumptious
Oh my god, the raw dishes here are soooo good, and every server is a sweet person! Try the live sandwich for a reasonably-priced treat
Great tea selection and a juice bar are other boons
I feel so healthy and vibrant after a meal at Caravan!
I made reservations for a large group, 16 of us all together, and we were given a long table in the back room, which was very cozy and added a sense of privacy to our little party
Our waitress was wonderfully attentive and did not lose her cool at all when our group began to get loud and boisterous
The staff even went out of their way to print up menus without prices at my request, since the dinner party was my treat
We were also the last to leave, so of course, we didn't experience any delays in getting the check
Service was excellent! All in all, my entire group loved the experience and my party was great fun thanks to Caravan of Dreams! In retrospect, the only thing I really regret is not leaving a bigger tip
the second we entered, the manager seated us immediately
we ordered with a prompt, friendly waitress, who brought our delicious nachos in under a minute
our entrees were brought at the speed of light and our table was in awe of the incredible food
then, things fell apart
our table was somehow switched to another waitress' section
we begged for dessert menus, in hopes of taking something sweet home
we waited 15 minutes for the menus, and another 15 to order
eventually, we got our check, but even after paying, we waited a half an hour for the desserts to be brought to the table - and that was only after we asked for *again*
the food was so incredible, i could not believe it but i'm not sure that i could suffer through that again
it's one of the saddest things of this day and age
Vegans love it for its selection of vegan and raw dishes prepared a la Mexican
The food is definitely fresh and ample
The atmosphere leans towards bohemian with a few hints of class-- live piano music plays in the background
The wine list includes an Austrian reserve blaufraenkisch red wine and a chenin blanc in the $20-25 range-- rare finds at such restaurant prices
Logistics and infrastructure require an upgrade
My reservation for 4 was at 8:30pm, yet we were not seated until 9:20pm
Had I not requested seating, my party would have been forgotten
There were not enough wine glasses to serve the wine, so we had to wait an extra hour until they were available
The waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly
The owner is quite attentive and even provided us a discount due to the long waits

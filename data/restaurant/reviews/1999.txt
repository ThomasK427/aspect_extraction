It was really a great night
My friend and I stumbled upon Diva on a Thursday night when were starving
Great martinis, very good food (try the tuna tartare), nice atmosphere and great service
I'll definitely go back
This place is no real Diva, while the bread was outstanding, the one piece given to you was a pathetic tease
All the food tasted great but was a feast for Kate Moss not someone with a real appetite
The goat cheese in filo dough, the grilled calamari and the hamburger were outstanding tastes, but again just tastes- go for a light bite if you have the money to spend, and look at the beautiful people to remind you why you're barely eating
Diva has a good personal-size pizza and a creative martini menu
Great location
the only reason i go to diva is to get their AWESOME lobster raviolis
They really are the best ones i have i ever tasted
a little pricey but worth every last penny
diva is in a great location and is always crowded
if you later on in the evening, you will be crammed side by side with people, just so you know, but the lobster raviolis are worth it
great crowd
When I lived in Soho, Diva became my favorite spot for taking clients and dates, and now that I live in Brooklyn, I still go back
Everyone always loves it
The ambience is great -- romantically rough-edged decor that's kept a little underlit, Latin music at a volume that allows conversation, and in the summer it's open to the streetlife of Soho
The food is just great, well-prepared and presented, and tastes wonderful
I've never had a bad meal in perhaps a dozen visits
The staff is friendly, alert and professional
And though there are usually plenty of gorgeous people there, it's also a welcoming spot for middle-aged post-hippies (like me)
Totally recommended
Diva restaurant is ideal for people between 21-35 who can enjoy upbeat flamingo music while they drink and dine
The food is excellent, in particular the Red Snapper
Also delicious is the Farfalle, rich in a thick white sauce and sliced salmon
Their bread is the best I've had, warm and soft
Service is excellent
The ambiance is dim and sexy with candles on every table
The bartenders are attractive, attentive and quick
It's a cool place with good food
I RAN INTO THIS RESTAURANT ON CITY SEARCH SO I DECIDED TO TRY OUT
THE FOOD WAS IMPECCABLE
THEY STARTED US OUT WITH A COMPLIMENTARY PUFF PASTRY WITH A MUSHROOM TOPPING THAT WAS TO DIE FOR
I HAD THE HANGER STEAK WITH MASH POTATOES AND SPINACH
THE STEAK WAS MOUTH WATERING AND THE MASH WAS DELICIOUS
MY PARTNER HAD A STEAK SPECIAL WITH MERLOT SAUCE AND MASH AND HE ALSO ENJOYED HIS MEAL
THE SERVICE WAS WONDERFUL DUE TO THE CHARMING WAITRESS WISH I HAD HER NAME
THE FOOD PRESENTATION WAS ALSO BEAUTIFUL
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SUGGEST IS COME AND ENJOY AFTER ITS A BIT DARK OUTSIDE SO YOU CAN REALLY ENJOY THE CANDLE LIT ROOM
WONDERFUL LITTLE RESTAURANT
Instead of your average little italy restaurants that serve the same pasta, Onieal's is an absolute prize
The food here is smart and eclectic (try the black cod or the short ribs)
The cocktails are like dreams and the service is friendly and efficient
The wine list is presented with great knowledge by the manager and the decor of the place is beautiful
The ceiling makes you feel like you are in a different time when people cared about what they served
I think everyone should experience this gem of a place
This place is not really a restaurant
About 85% of the space is devoted to the bar area where the music is LOUD and there is a noisy crowd
Strangely, you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the bar area which makes for an awkward meal
Arrived on a Sat
night around 9:30 and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant
Food (ordered crab cakes and cod) was ok - definitely not anything above average
We had a difficult time hearing each other while dining b/c the adjacent bar area was so loud with club music and there is only a small partition to separate the spaces
We recommend strongly against this place for dinner - stop by for a drink if you're so inclined but food is clearly this place's second priority
Don't plan on returning
I just read the good review in Time Out NY about Onieal's so I went to see it for myself
It really is a wonderful place
The service is friendly, the food is delicious and the decor is so comfortable
They have a balanced wine list and the cocktails are so creative and imaginative
I highly recommend it to everyone
The food here is cartoonishly bad
I had the crabcakes with a side of mashed potatoes
The cakes themselves contained almost no actual crab and sat on a sorry bed of obviously canned corn (you know, the grade school lunch variety)
The potatoes came from a cardboard box no less than 30 minutes before they reached our table
My girlfriend had the pork loin, which arrived half raw and topped with school lunch half peach
With a bottle of wine, the whole affair ran us over $100
Ridiculous
Went here for drinks, seems like a great afterwork bar
Stuart the bartender was very cool
Didn't actually eat anything but the people next to us ordered some appetizers that looked great
My friends and I had dinner at Onieal's and absolutely loved the place
The food was top notch (get the black cod) and the same goes for the service
We stayed and had another delicious cocktail (strawberry collins) in the outdoor cafe
Overall, it was a great time
I happened upon this restaurant by accident a couple of years ago while visiting NYC from Phoenix, AZ
Now I make the pilgrimage once a year without fail
Make the time to stop by for dinner and leave room in your schedule to stay afterwards for a drink at the bar
Exciting menu, great drinks
What a hidden gem
The food deserves a standing applause
I had the duck and my fiancee had the black cod
Simply out of this world
Whoever is running the place sure is doing something right
I've been coming to Onieal's for a while now and each time I the food and cocktails keep getting better
The new fall menu has a black cod with miso broth so good I thought I was at Nobu
And my friends really enjoyed the scallops and 3 tiered duck
Also, the cocktails keep getting more inventive
Scarlet Orange Sangrias, Violet Saketinis and the Ocean Margaritas all look like Easter eggs but taste like sin and paradise mixed together
Keep up the good work Onieal's
A place that I find myself returning to over and over again! LOVE the salmon! staff is friendly and the cocktail list is amazing!
Truly one of the finest experiences I have had in the longest time
The staff was courteous and very sweet, the food was outstanding (get the short ribs or the crab cakes) and the cocktails were out of this world
I can't recommend enough the strawberry collins and the bell pepper margharita
And ask the bartender about the secret tunnel
Two thumbs way up
What a relief it is to get away from the hurried crowds of Chinatown and Little Italy's Mulberry Street! A hidden gem right on the edge of town, ONieal's serves up some of the best food in a cozy, friendly and casual (but not TOO casual) atmosphere
The fish is absolutely amazing and the steaks are cooked to perfection
The decor is beautiful and the staff is friendly, helpful and makes you feel right at home
I will DEFINITELY be coming back to ONieal's!

MC is well located in w
village, tucked away on a quiet tree lined block
A great place to stop when you're taking in the west village and want to get away from the crowds
As for the cookies, Awesome
I have a big sweet tooth and have been several times, I have not been let down once
My favorite is the PBJ
Selection of many would-be favorites and all very tasty
Many choices worth coming back for and find the quality that seems to be the result of careful attention to detail
Great tastes and fun to visit
i went to milk and cookies with a girlfriend who had heard of the place on the today show
when we arrived, the place looked adorable - like quaint, old country kitchen - and smelled amazing - like, well, cookies
i ordered an oatmeal cranberry blueberry cookie, a double chocolate cookie, and a classic chocolate chip cookie
given the place's namesake, i was naturally expecting AMAZING cookies but found that the cookies were in all honesty not that good at all
THE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE WAS AWFUL
it was very stiff and sort of stale
i took two bites and threw it out (and i never throw food out)
a place that mainly serves cookies should be able to throw together a decent classic like the chocolate chip
i'm sorry but there is no excuse for bad chocolate chip cookies
NOTHING WORTH TRYING
go someplace else!
The cookies are great, even better with ice cream or a shake
the brownies and bar cookies are equally fantastic - a sweet-tooth's heaven!
Milk Cookies is an absolute GEM! The owners have struck gold in this place
You have some many choices it's almost impossible to decide what to get
The S'Mores brownie is like no other s'more you'll ever have! Recommendation - order your own creation and they will bake it while you wait! Three different choices of dough and a list of at least 20 mix-in choices
They bring them to your table piping hot with glasses of cold milk
I asked the owner if I could move in
It's a small place, with a very friendly homey feel to it
They also serve milkshakes, malts and ice cream but those will have to be sampled on another trip
GO! You too will want the owners to adopt you
Milk and Cookies is ingenious! I went with two friends and had the smores bar - two yummy chocolate chip cookies with marshmallows and chocolate melted between, and they serve it piping hot! It was to die for
They'll make you custom cookies to order (minimum order is a dozen for $12)
Well worth it, and you can take the rest home
It's the most welcoming and charming little place and the treats are fantastic
Indulge yourself and go!
The cookies are nice and soft and good - just like Mom makes
I tried the snickerdoodle and it was my favorite
The generous servings of milk finish of this lovely treat
When I don't have time to go to mid-town to enjoy Korean food, this is where I go
I go to this restaurant pretty often and all my Korean and non-Korean friends enjoy eating here
Only complaint I have is that they don't give you more than 3 bahnchan (side dishes) that Korean meals are known to have
Only restaurant I frequent other than this one is Hanbat on 35th street
This is one of few really good Korean restaurants in Manhattan
I highly recommend it
I also find the staff very helpful and friendly
My friend took me to Li Hua for dinner after a shopping exertion at the nearby Bloomingdales in SOHO
To my surprise, we found a Korean Gem in Chinatown
The Stonepot Kalbi bi bim bap is delicious! The staff was friendly
The restaurant decor was pretty nice, clean and simple
Good for group dining with friends
Prices are reasonably cheap
Once you try it, you'll crave it again
I am a native Korean and this is where to go when you miss authentic Korean food
I think the taste is the best in the city
They have this amazing infusion stove that cooks all their hot pot dishes that are excellent
The banchan could be improved but considering the price, you can't argue with that
The service is good and clean
Why does this restaurant have such a low overall rating? My wife and I just had an excellent dinner there
The food was great, and the service outstanding
Having eaten Korean food around the country for the past 15 years, this stacks up to the best of them
Very attractive, immaculate surroundings
The seafood/scallion pancake is a must, as is the three mushroom and zucchini rice dish
My friends took me to this great Thai place
They love going there to have dinner after work
The food is DELICIOUS and the price is INCREDIBLE! The portions are decent compared to the prices
It became our favorite place to hang out
The place is very nice and cozy
The service is very prompt and friendly
The best thing about this place is the food!!! I really like their presentations
My favorite dish is the Serloin Steak with Thai Herbs and authentic green curry! They always have interesting specials which changes very often
The lunch specials are a great deal
It is served with salad and spring roll
I really, really recommend this place
Oh, by the way, you gotta try their desserts!!! Yumm
I tried this restaurant because of the mostly favorable reviews on this site
First, the good news: Service was prompt and courteous
The place was clean (by New York standards)
The coconut milk/lemongrass soup that came with dinner was outstanding
The red curry with chicken was acceptable (although I have had better)
The Macau beer was an outstanding value at $3
25
Then we had the pad-thai with pork, and things started to go downhill from there
First impression from the pad-thai was a slightly unpleasant egg odor
The smell kind of subsided after a generous sprinkle with lime juice
However, the pork was largely inedible
It was smelly, and greasy
I had to remove a piece that was indiscribable
So, generally I was pleased, however one unpleasant dish can ruin your whole dining experience
So many restaurants offer a few good items but they lack evenness and quality control
This is the case here
One of the better light restaurants within a few blocks of me (I live near MacDougal/Bleecker)
Is quiet, friendly, and serves fresh, crispy thai food
Excellent value pad thai and special offers on the wine and beer most nights
The specials can also be good, but I tend to just run with the classics as they are such good value
The fried banana dessert is wonderfully presented and tasty (get it with coconut ice creme)
And if you're a local student on a budget this place is your non-wallet busting date
After reading the rave reviews about the restaurant I was qutie excited but alas, the place was at best average
A lot of the dishes (basil shrimp, tom yum soup, duck) were way too salty which greatly took away from the flavors of the dishes
I also ordered a daily special of salmon/shrimp which sounded great but when I asked to make the fish rare I was told that it's not a good idea since it will have a funny smell/taste
While I do appreciate the warning that right away sets off the alarm that the fish (even for the daily special!) is second-degree freshness

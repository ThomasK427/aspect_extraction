i ordered the butternutsquash soup
explained to the server that it was watery and tasteless
she returned it to the kitchen
crave being a small establishment i overheard the chef/owner say very rude words about me
also i asked for the halibut
they were out, then asked for short ribs
also out
the service was exceptional, but how can they expect to run a restaurant being out of their menu items and slandering their customers b/c the soup wasn't prepared properly
maybe thats why we were the only ones there!
The food here is delicious - no matter what you order
We had the duck, which was soft, succulent, juicy, almost perfect, just a tad too salty
Shu mai dumplings were really incredible
The one thing that was not at all good was the service
Immediately, I have to tell you it was not the waiter's fault
Rorry did a wonderful job
However, he worked the whole restaurant by himself, not even a busboy to help him
Thus, since the restaurant had at least 8 other occupied tables besides ours, he had to do the work of 3 people
The management should think about hiring some more waiters or at least some busboys
They did try to make my wife's birthday celebration special by painting Happy Birthday in chocolate chilli syrup around the Chocolate Chilli Cake, which was a really original desert, if a hard on the pallate (spicy after-taste!)
The food tastes good
Other than that, the place is so damn contrived and sub-par in every way
Imagine the River Cafe crammed into a tiny room the size of a cheap Manhattan studio apartment, and with no decor, and paying $80 for a nice waitress to explain to you the art (aka food) on your plate, comprising a meal that will leave you craving the pizza across the street
This restaurant is strictly for Brooklyn yuppies and trendies
With their newly expanded dinning room and revamped menu Crave has pulled off one of the best neighborhood dinning experiences available in New York
Definitely try the tasting menu with wine parings, personalized for each table by the chef himself
Service was some of the best I have ever encountered, personable and knowledgeable while still being unobtrusive
This place is just as good for Tuesday night burgers and beer as it is for entertaining out of town guests on the weekends
Would not hurt to make reservations - the place is a really tiny cozy neighborhood place with extremely upscale food - fantastic! Loved the ambience - trendy, modern edge to the place
This is the type of place you stop into with a friend or two - or loved one for some good conversation and great food
Not the type of place to go if you want total quiet, romance, and privacy since it is so small, but definitely worth going back to
I like eating at Crave and the food is delicious, but the prices don't quite match the atmosphere
Maybe it's just me, but when I pay $25-$30 just for an entree, I expect something special in the dining room
The room, however, is very small and kind of plain
The shrimp po-boy for $10, however, is right on target
The restaurant was small yet cozy
It was definitely a retreat away from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan restaurants
The food was excellent - contrasts in texture and taste, presentation, and creativity
I love how they had paired a glass of wine with the ancho chili powdered duck I ordered
I felt that it brought out the tenderness and subtle sweetness in the duck, as well as cooling down the little kick in it
For dessert, I had the coconut tapioca and my boyfriend had the chili chocolate cake
The tapioca was delicious and the chocolate cake was unique - the chili kick would follow the pleasant sweetness
Wish there was a little more maple ice cream to finish the cake with
Overall our experience was wonderful and would definitely go back again
a little hole in the wall, but great food
Because the place is so small you are attended to very well, and the food, although a bit pricey for what it is, is rather good
The take away is amazing as well for that home cooked meal at home you wish you could make
Maybe we came on an off night, but the steak was incredibly fatty and had to be sent back, which I feel bad about doing (it was only the second time in my life I've sent food back)
BEcause of this, one of us had to eat while the other watched, or the food got cold
In addition, they were incredibly short staffed
they only had one woman waitressing (who was FANTASTIC), and she definitely could have used some help
There are not enough good things I can say about Crave
Marco and Debbie (owners/chefs) are phenomenal
The food--outstanding
In this intimate restaurant, we found some of the best food in NY
We had the eight course tasting menu
Each course was perfectly paired with wine selected by Marco
(We were fortunate enough to have Marco also be our server)
The sea bass with sweet chili sauce and coca-cola bbq shrimp are not to be missed! The attention to detail was also superb
This is absolutely the perfect date spot
Hands-down, Crave is one of the better restaurants I've been to lately
The attention to detail and service was amazing
Their selection of food can range from burgers to gourmet (depending on whatever you crave)
One appetizer to try, if they have it, would be the foie gras, banana, grilled eel and bruchetta glazed with chocolate
Sounds like a strange combination, but the textures and taste is divine! The entrees were well prepared and filling, sadly it left me no room for dessert
Though it gives me an excuse to want to go back soon! The pricing was affordable and worth its value
The atmosphere is very intimate possibly because of its small size, only enough seating for 16 people
They have a first come, first serve basis for the regular menu, but I think they might take reservations for their tasting menu
This place is a cozy, little joint for some resonably priced south american cuisine
My girlfriend is colombian, were they have a similar way of making arepas and she says these are some of the best in the city
The food is really good, and very cheap
I don't understand the bad reviews
I keep going back for the ceviches, and arepas
This restaurant is a terrific value for brunch
At $12 the entrees were generously sized and delicious
This price also included a glass of wine or sangaria
I was plesently surprised after reading some of the Citysearch reviews
It is a very nice and cosy place
The service was great
We were not too hungry, so we ordered 2 arepas each (which was enough for a light dinner) and a sangria
The arepas were delicious (specially the one with chicken avocado) and the sangria was great as well
I really recomend it
There were 7 of us who went
We all decided to get ice water
but since we had such a large party, the serve forced us to get drinks! That's gotta be the worse service on the face of the planet
My experience: The appetizer was utterly flavorless and presented in a little paper pouch, thrown haphazardly on a plate
The live music was unbearably bad and unbearably loud
The staff repeatedly forgot we were there
My entree (the King Fish steak) failed on all accounts: no aroma, no flavor, poor presentation, and had a tough-to-swallow texture
The spinach salad was passable
I usually eat everything put before me; here, I was unable to finish even half of my meal
The worst food I've ever paid $25 for, presented by sullen staff, and accompanied by lousy entertainment (try a lounge version of Roxanne played on Acoustic guitar at conversation-killing levels)
The main course did come with a very delicious slice of lime which was good with the rice
Not sure where the negetive reviews are coming from
Complainers? I thought the arepas were great and the chicken entrees were nice too
You get a lot of food for a reasonable price
The service was nice and attentive
The out of the way location is great
I'll be back soon
The food is really bad and overpriced
To much attitude from the staff that work there

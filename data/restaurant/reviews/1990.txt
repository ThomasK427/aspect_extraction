But everything has changed
I went to eat there one night and I was treated so bad that I've lost my appetite
Everyone was rushing to clean and put things away
The ladies were so grouchy and had no etiquette
They were just absolutely nasty! I was very disappointed from the incident
No matter how good their food is if the service is bad, it isn't worth spending time and money there
I wish they would address this flaw while they can
You can never trade good service with good food
Shanghai Cafe (they changed their name when they moved from their small location at 59 Mott to their spacious place at 100 Mott) is my favorite Chinese restaurant
The food is fresh, flavorful and abundant; their scallion pancakes are the best
non greasy and well cooked (unlike some of their competitors like Joe's Shanghai or Green Bo)
The menu has a wide variety of delicious dishes from Shanghai soup dumplings to vegetarian mock duck (made w/ bean curd and black mushrooms) to real duck, from shrimp and edamane (on the menu, it 's green bean) to a variety of noodles both fried and in soup
And get a bubble tea Everyone I have ever brought to this restaurant is thrilled with the find and return on their own
The waitresses are extremely rude and obnoxious, they placed the wrong order and try to force you to accept and pay
The staff makes you feel so uncomfortable by staring and trying to rush you out
And you dont even need to ask for the check because it will be handed in the middle of your meal
Like the previous review said, if the waiters and waitresses really hate their jobs that much, PLEASE work else where
There are better Shaghai rest
in Chinatown
This place offers the worst service ever
The waitresses are rude
In addition, the food is not all that great, Joe's Shanghai taste better
PS : to the waitresses and waiters at Shanghai Cafe(new name of Shanghai Gourmet) if you don't like your job, don't work there
Noodles in soup, rice dishes and steamed buns and other Shanghainese favorites
The food comes out fast and hot
Portions seem to have gotten smaller over the years but at least the price is still kinda cheap
As for the restaurant, it's a bit cramped and the tables can get greasy like a diner
But if you're just gonna be in and out of the place, who cares?
You could make a whole meal of just the delicious pork crab buns! They don't make them until you order them so they arrive at the table hot and steaming
The decor is a little shabby and the seating can be cramped, but the quick service and outrageously affordable prices more than make up for it
The Scene It has the minimal chic trappings of '80s design, but the friendly atmosphere of a neighborhood fixture
Familiar guests are hailed at the entrance bar before passing through to a small dining room decked out with black-leather banquettes, wood tones and ambient lighting
The Food The reasonably priced menu offers few surprises, but scores in the details
The appetizers are packed with appealing salads--roasted golden beets have a warm, full-flavored glow; a roasted pear is stuffed with creamy Gorgonzola and tiny bacon bits; and pan-seared scallops are offset with tangy mango and arugula
Main courses include a delicious blend of wild mushrooms, artichoke and roast potato that adds juice to branzino (Italian sea bass), and a potato-crusted organic chicken breast that's unexpectedly rich
this place has suprisingly good food and service
The atmosphere is quaint, intimate, peaceful-- a hidden jewel in Tribeca
Sure, the prices are typical New York, but no more and no less
I enjoyed my experience!
We had a fabulous meal there on a Saturday night! The service was good - the owner personally seated every party and wished them well as they left
We ordered a variety of appetizers including the crabcakes, lobster rolls and poached shrimp-- one was better than the next
The tuna was by far one the best dishes of tuna I have ever had in the city! The sauces were all incredible on the tuna, as well as the halibut beef tenderloin
Good date restaurant for a quiet dinner and also fabulous for a group of friends
The seat in the window is the prime location, although the tables in the main dining room are spaced far enough apart so that you are not listening in on others conversations
I will continue to go back and recommend this to all of my friends!
I go to restaurants quite a bit and always review them on CitySearch
I generally am disappointed with New York restaurants: top chefs turning out so-so fare, terrible inattentive service, long waits, obnoxious atmosphere
Duane Park is precisely the opposite
Attentive, leisurely, with cuisine that generally is inspired and that works
Comfortable fare, some innovative dishes, and a waitstaff that is actually professional
I walked in at lunch without a reservation
I was seated promptly, my waiter had good timing and made excellent recommendations
I want to work my way through their entire desert menu
A very pleasant and relaxed experience
I had heard good things about this place, but I was in for a major disappointment
Had a reservation, but was seated for an hour after the resercation time
The service was horribly slow, to the point that I could have gone home [to Midtown] and come back with some McDonald's faster
The food was average and overpriced
A huge disappointment!
This is a perfect way to end your day
A small sophisticated and charming restaurant with very good food
Try the braised ribs
EXCELLENT!  I personally liked this place a lot
I felt very comfortable being there and chatting away
Staff was also very nice
A definite recommend
Zagat's reports that inexplicably you can get a last minute reservation here and they were right
Because of this though, we were suspiscious about what we would find but we were so pleasantly surprised
From the host to the waiter everyone was extremely friendly and helpful
The food was wonderful, especially for the price
The atmosphere is cozy
We would definintely go back
I've been to Duane Park 3 times, the last for Father's Day
All the staff were extremely courteous and patient, including the owner, who chatted with my Mother at the bar
The food, especially the Horseradish Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Foie Gras whipped potatoes, spinach, and wild mushrooms; Scallop and Crab Cake and Roasted Monk Fish with purple mash potatoes, lobster seafood sausage, and saffron vinaigrette, was excellent
The atmosphere is relaxing and pleasant and I eagerly await my next meal there
One of the city's best
Scallop/crab cake appetizer featured light and crispy exterior/melty gooey interior accompanied by a bland but pleasant lemon 'vinaigrette' (more like a cream) indifferent pickled seaweed/cucumber salad
Bizarre monkfish/seafood sausage/purple potato puree with saffron sauce main course
Floured-and-fried monkfish was dry, potato was lumpy and bland, garlicky spinach far too salty, gloppy saffron sauce strangely cinnamony and pumpkiny
Eeew
Seafood sausage was nice, if no match for what's served a block away at Chanterelle
Baked peach ok, but uncompelling, and the 'white chocolate mousse' that accompanied it was neither a mousse, nor did it contain much white chocolate
Decor needs improvement
Cheap chairs/tables, 'clothpapery' napkins w/phone number of the napkin company printed on in red, torn leather banquettes and murky water in the otherwise lovely flower arrangements
Waiter was helpful and prompt in bringing items out, but tap water never materialized
An interesting lunch, but not one I'll be repeating soon
Had 7PM reservations
Place was empty and found the service to be very good, polite service
Not aggressive or pushy
Food was good although menu was a little limited(still plenty to chose from)
By time we finished dinner 2 1/2 hours later, restaurant was packed
2 or 3 tables had come and gone
At no time was there pressure to leave
After we left, the maitre'd/owner(?) came outside to bid us a good evening
Service and style is not lost here
I will be back
I went to see belly dancer Dalia Carella
She was amazing, the restaurant was nice the bartender was friendly,
The food was delicious

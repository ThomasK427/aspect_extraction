Top notch atmosphere and a terrific selection on the juke box
Jazz club downstairs
Food is good to very good
A meat lovers delight
Dissapointed they didn't have fried green tomatos---out of season--I didn't know unripe tomatos had a season
Great place to meet friends after work
Looooove this place
Good vibe, great ribs, delish potato chips and blue cheese and bacon dip - but most of all those blood orange margaritas! Been twice in 2 weeks and found the service friendly
Will definitely go again despite the fact that 3 drinks, chips and dips came to over $30
The smoked Foie gras was delicious then it was downhill
My 1/2 order of salt and pepper ribs were nothing like the full order that my friends ordered
Mine were almost meatless and recooked
The bread and pickles is a cute idea but NO the bread is commercial presliced wonder bread type
Yuk!!! Service was friendly but extremely slow
Music was Chinese water torture, disco,selected on the juke box which was set ta a much too high a volume
The Pear and cranberry crisp was almost all underbaked crisp with little fruit
Will I go back, maybe for the foie gras
Danny Meyer where are you? I wanted to love it but no
Made a return trip to Blue smoke after being their twice around the opening
I really wanted to love it but was more disappointed than when they opened
The food has not improved if anything it got worse
Danny must be hurting just for the fact that he installed TV's at the bar and has a sign promoting Monday Night Football in the window
The service was spotty at best
Ordered 4 desert the 3 that required no work in the kitchen (cakes and pies were rushed out and the Ice Cream Sundae had to be asked where it was and eventually showed up 10 minutes later
This was in a resturant that was not full
Food is ok But i wanted someone to tell me what is Braised Collard Greens
Worth every minute of the 1/2 hour wait, despite out reservation
Hey - What better excuse to sit at the bar and try another one of their fantastic drinks
If you are craving barbque
try out Blue Smoke! The side dishes are definitely the stars on the menus, so don't be shy order a few
I have no idea why in certain magazines this place is perceived well
The waits are too long
(too long for the crappy food you are about to recieve)
Poor menu
The rips??? I can make better rips in my microwave
The slaw
gimme a break
the rips were so dry, I even had to drink more of the way too expensive and too warm Shiraz
NYC does not need such a place!(or at least not the ill-considered hipe)
So much for all the hype
The ribs were dry and virtually meatless
And the magic dust, or a dry rub, is for use BEFORE you cook the meat, not as a condiment! My friend's pulled-pork platter was colorless and bland, and the key lime pie was bitter-tasting
As former Southerners, we appreciated the friendly service, but we won't go back for that food
If you want good BBQ in NYC, go to Virgil's
Blue Smoke is solid all-around, but nothing to write home about
The food is tasty overall, but there are some complaints
In particular, the mac and cheese is disappointing, and also the temperature of the food is too cool at times
The atmosphere is big and comfortable, but the music is way, way too loud
You can't have a conversation without yelling, which, to me, is not enjoyable at all
The service is friendly but often slow and off-beat and the tone at times resembles a theme restaurant like Planet Hollywood more than a Danny Meyer restaurant
Overall, definitely worth a visit, but disappointing if you are expecting an experience on par with Mr
Meyer's other restaurants
BBQ is ordinal, and cole slaw is not even worth trying
Onion rings are good, though
I spent a couple of years in the South, and perhaps expectation is high
I used to frequent the Jazz Standard before it became Blue Smoke, and I was glad to find their Mojito is still great
Was at blue smoke last night
and the only things worth writing about is the 20oz house beer, collard greens onion rings, pretty sad
The ribs were missing something, the mac-n-cheese tasted like plastic and the pulled pork was missing flavor
I was better off going to the supermarket and buyng a 6 pack and some velveta mac-n-cheese
I had to try it but I will still travel to pearson's
As for the music
forget the jukebox
a madonna fan must have put $10 in
The ribs sampler and onion rings were excellent
Good portions
Great selection of beer
Service was slow and spotty; had to flag the waiter down many a time to get drink and food orders in
The apple fritters are a must
If you are a big fan of ribs and steak, over a glass of beer, Blue Smoke will fit your needs and provide the necessary joy temporarily, even though the food is not extravagant
otherwise, it is kinda overpriced, and not worth the bucks for a plate of spare ribs and cole slaw
The desserts do more justice to the menu! jazz fans, you can enjoy your meal in the jazz bar downstairs, same menu offered
The owners od Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Bar, Tabla couldve done better with the food quality here!
I am originally from Texas, which has some of the worlds best smoked meats -or- barbecue
This is the best barbecue I have had in the northeast
Keep in mind there is a HUGE difference between grilling and barbecuing
Grilling doesn't involve somking, and there are very few if any resautrants that actually have permits for the appropriate smokers in the city
This is a true smokehouse and will substitute for TX any day
The mac cheese I highly recommend if that your bag!
Its is a great place to catch up with a few friends over some ribs and drinks! If you decide to stay for dinner, the food is not dissapointing in the least and dessert is a definite! especially, the chocolate cake! ambiance is fair, but remember to make reservations in advance, else you will be starving by the time your table is ready!
pathetic barbeque chicken salad


room is far too cavernous


decent baby backs
The onion rings, mac cheese, the mephis styled ribs and banana cream pie were very good
The deviled eggs were good but for $6 you think they could give you more than just 2 eggs sliced in half - what did they mix with the egg yolks, truffles? I was surprised that it wasn't as loud as I was expecting - hopefully the hipster wannabe have moved on
I'll go back again
We reserved for a Saturday night and the place was packed, and we didn't get seated right away, which was fine, since the service was friendly and real fast
I'm not a BBQ specialist, but I everything I ordered was delicious except for the baked beans (they tasted like celery)
I loved the beef brisket, mac n cheese, and key lime pie
This is a no-attitude, casual place that's great to take parents or children
I have recommended this place to friends and will definitely go back more than once
great service from the front door all the way in and back out again!! Texas ribs dry rubbed!!! Best root beer in town
very cool to see dressed up men and women licking their fingers and gnawing on bones
Great desserts also,I've had everyone of them
Jukebox could use some blues and soul!!
Beyond good -- It was like I was back home in Texas

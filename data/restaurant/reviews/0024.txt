Service was good and food is wonderful
I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)  It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat
The Scene Located in the lobby level of famed "Black Rock," the CBS headquarters building, it's one of the busiest bars in Gotham, filled with attractive folks in suits yelling at each other over the din
The dramatic space complements the food and will wow out-of-towners
The Food The consistently scrumptious Pan-Asian food is a secondary consideration when you're trying to chat up a 26-year-old who, unbeknownst to you, is in a position of great power
But to seal the deal, a table for two and a few bites of grilled salmon on greens or lamb in mandarin orange sauce is the way to go
Food like this can be found in other cities, but the combination of architecture, arrogance and mouthwatering aromas is strictly a New York phenomenon
Yes, the restaurant is pricey but the portions are made to be shared
I had the lobster pancakes, which is a deceiving name
They aren't fried pancakes
they are lobster rolled in crepes
AMAZING
Crab cakes were so on point! We sat in their outdoor dining area which was very lovely and comfortable
Our cocktails were made perfectly, the food was abundant and delicious
Definitely would recommend this place! :)
The establishment looks like a nice, classy dining place
My dinner was accompanied by fruitflies and i had to constantly swat them with my hands
If you want authentic fusion food, try going somewhere else
i came here with 2 friends for restaurant week last night
the place is very large, sort of cavernous, and dimly-lit
we were told that they were running late, so we ended up waiting around 20 minutes for our table
the regular prices looked pretty expensive (~$15 per appetizer, ~$35 per entre) so the restaurant week menu (at $35pp) seemed like a sweet deal
though we had 3 in our party, we were told that we could only get 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts portions would be adjusted accordingly
i guess everythings served family style
we chose the vegetable dumplings lamb spareribs to start
i thought their dumplings were good shreaded vegetables stuffed into thin skins, pan-fried, and drowned in a slightly spicy tangy red sauce
the ribs came in a huge pile and were very aromatic grilled and brushed with a sweet hoisin-like sauce
for our entrees, we chose the bbq salmon and the grilled skirt steak
the salmon was cooked medium it was really fresh and we detected no fishy taste
it was a little bland though, and i didn't really detect any bbq taste
the steak was cooked medium rare it was very tender, but came in the same sauce as the lamb
the steak also came with a pile of lo mein noodles that were springy and tasty
there were only 2 desserts to choose from we got the cheesecake mousse the trio of sorbets/ice cream
the cheesecake was pretty good and light for cheesecake
the sorbets were normal, but they were both good endings to the meal
overall, i dont think the food is good/cheap enough for me to come again, but i had a good time while i was there
Good vibrant midtown place to take people you want to wow with NYC-ness
Food is very rich and flavorful
Our waitress was very proactive, courteous and helpful
It is a bit loud but not impossibly so
Had the lamb spare ribs (sweet and succulent), lobster mashed potatoes (wow!) and duck entree (tasted like a juicy steak!) and mousse dessert
These are all things I don't usually prefer to eat but I loved every bite
Expensive-- over $100 per person but we had ordered a moderately expensive bottle of wine dessert-- so I think $100/person is decent
I have had dinner with my girlfriend before at China Grill and had an ok experience
So when I had 6 business guests from out of town coming, it seemed a decent choice
WRONG! We had an 8:15pm reservation but by 9pm, we were still not seated - very  embarassing for a business dinner client
The host's explanation was they could not control when people finish dinner
What are reservations for in the first place?  We would have left and gone to another restaurant but the host kept saying that a table was opening up in 5 minutes, people had just paid, etc - except when I went to check the table, they were ordering dessert
We left at 9:15pm for another restaurant and promptly got seated
Definitely not a good impression on the client
To start off they lost our reservation and instead of trying to fix their mistake they made us wait almost 2 hours to be seated
After they finally seated us the service SUCKED the place was too loud and the food was bland and over priced
Perhaps, we should have read between the lines
The fact that the resteraunt staff couldn't even keep a reservation straight, not to mention that after screwing up, they told us to go scratch and made us wait almost 2 hours
In retrospect, I should have gone to McDonalds, made myself wait a couple hours to eat and told myself off and I could have saved a few dollars and had about the same food
My suggestion would be to eat elsewhere
but their pan-asian fare was so so
we shared many dishes but none really stood out except the spinach, wow!! how they do that?? it is a happening loud place can't hear each other speak with group of 6
took a while to be seated
service once we ordered became snail paced
bathrooms are kool
bar scene packed, lots of pretty people
but for food, I'd rather go elsewhere
SUM IT: just to try their spinach otherwise guess good for expense accounts
We had high expectations for this restaurant and the service was good but there was no app, entree, and desert for each person
We had to share two apps, two entrees, and two desserts among four of us
The restaurant's music was too loud for four people to be able to converse and the ventilation was horrible
We smelt like the restaurant all day
The food was cooked nicely but again we were all expecting much more
I always remember China Grill as having great food
Pair that with the high, high ceilings, huge dining space and impeccable service and you have yourself a great restaurant
However, a recent dining experience during restaurant week left more to be desired
The food was decent although, not spectacular
The skirt steak was good, items on the menu for restaurant week were slightly limited but even items ordered off the restaurant week menu were a little disappointing
I would still go back but, the food will have to be amazing the next time around
I was very dissapointed with my overall experiance at China Grill
The service was ok but the food was less than good
Not recommended
i went there last night
my friend i have been a regular over the past couple of years
we noticed some changes with our fav
bartenders management and at first were a bit disappointed with food
but have tried some of the near items and have come around
i had the mango martini's too (as did the previous review)
they were good but i don't recommend getting two
i had a hangover
anyway, the food has improved and this place is always busy
great location (midway between east west)
I go there with my UK colleagues who seem to love the place, but I'm underwhelmed
It's a huge space with a cavernous front dining area, bar area, and rear dining area - and very loud everywhere except the ladies room! The food is tasty but definitely heavy on greens, noodles, and low ticket items
There were lots of harried waiters tripping over our things
Drinks were ok, had a mango martini that was tasty
I think there are better places in the city
I eat out quite often and was completely blown away by how bad this experience was
I took a few clients for lunch and the service was lackluster, food was fair at best, and the prices were outrageous - Don't wast your time with this place ! It's still riding on its buzz from 5 years ago
My boyfriend I had been looking for engagement rings on a Saturday afternoon
After finding what we wanted, we were very hungry and wanted to celebrate
We wer in a great mood and decided to go China Grill for a late unch prix fixe
The place was practically empty and they sat us at a terrible table next to the set up / register table
The waitress gave us attitude because we orderred the price fix and not the regular menu

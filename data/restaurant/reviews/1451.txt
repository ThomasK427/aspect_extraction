the meats came with rice, a salad, and three little sides
i asked what was in the sides and the waitress couldn't tell me, turns out two of the items were in the kimchi sampler
the kimchi and other sides were off, the rice had red bean mixed in, and the waitress gave us a double order of the bulgogi instead of two single orders of different meats
the bbq was not bad, but just not authentic
i'd rather make the trek out to ktown to get the real thing
Wow, beer for 1
50, edamame 1
00, so cheap
The taste ??, not too bad
It's ok
But how you expect for $ 1
00 edamame ?, will not you expect fresh edamame on which still on the tree as Megu Edamame ?
The food is ok, the service as you pay
Come, order as soon as possible, eat, pay and go
Free sugar for making your own dessert in the front
This places is wonderful to sit and hangout
The food is really good, simple and well prepared
The biggest draw originally was the price
It is so well worth it
I am definitely recommending this place
The only drawback is that the music is a little loud so be prepared to lean forward alot
Amidst little tokyo on st marks, there is kenka with the cheapest beer and sake on the island blaring traditional japanese music - no doubt, a fob haven
Im not necessarily saying this place is some fine culinary experience its just really really cheap and good for the price
Dont think this is a restaurant this is a Japanese bar that also happens to serve food
Go to get drunk and have fun, and when the munchies kick in eat some grub but when it gets busy - expect to wait a while for service
i thought $2 for a can of schlitz or pbr in brooklyn was good- a pint of sapporo is $1
50!! the cooks are bad-asses the dumplings are awesome
it's so cheap (and more importantly, delicious) why wouldn't you go?
Kenka is Japanese for fight
This little restaurant fights to keep their prices low
This is one of those gems where you have good food, cheap beer and unbelievable prices
The unfortunate thing is that it's popular so going with a bigger group may make you wait around for a while
My gf doesn't like the bright lights but I like them
The Japanese folk music blaring on the quaint speakers are a trip and they have some interesting things on the menu like bull pen|s and turkey testicles
Feel free to try those and write a review ;)
Had a wonderful evening here
The staff was warm and friendly and the food was delicious
The co-op concept is unique and it is great to be able to support former Windows on the World employees
I would recommend everyone to check it out
the food was ok and the actual experience was good but the prices are too scandalous for something that wasn't exceptional
if you have the money to spend go right ahead, but if you'd don't, don't bother
choices were good to very fair of the four in our party [heavy breading, tough meat, reheated boiled chicken in a salad]
service was inept
no service, including taking our initial order, was offered without our searching for someone to help us
the main courses were brought to the wrong persons
2 ordered coffee after dinner and both cups were served to the same person
not logical
What a special evening
My dinner was absolutely spectacular, rich in new taste surprises and beautifully presented
The staff was lovely
The world decor is gorgeous and the spirit of the worker owners from all over the world fills the menu and the great space
Highly recommend!
I wanted to try this because it is such a unique enterprise - co-op owned by workers formerly employed at Windows on the World (World Trade Center)
The atmosphere was lovely, staff professional and nice
Food was delicious and of very generous proportions
I had the scallops (perfectly cooked) on a bed of well-seasoned mustard greens, with a row of shredded ox-tail meat in a delicious sauce
I'd definitely go back, either for dinner or some wine with a cheese platter
Celebrated my 50th birthday here on opening night
The food was wonderfully flavorful, the service exceptional, and the ambience was warm and stylish
I will return
extremely friendly service and overall cozy ambiance
my husband raved about his food and drinks the entire cab ride home
we had a 1 yr old with us, and the restaurant was so accomodating and welcoming of him
abstract decor with dedication to the towers
really beautiful
I have been three times to IA and each time, the food, wine and service have been excellent
The servers were always attentive but not obtrusive, and very European, meaning that they did not hover, but allowed us to linger as long as we wanted
I recommend the skirt steak and the empanadas
The caramel dessert was also excellent
I went last night, just walked in w/ my girlfriend w/ no reservation
We were seated promptly
Both the food and wine were excellent
I've been to three other Argentinean restaurants in the city and this place was second to none
Service was friendly and very good
If you're w/ someone else, I recommend the Cortada for two
It comes on a sizzling grill
I will definitely go back to this place
Gave this place the benefit of the doubt and revisited
Service was terrible
I'm not normally one to complain but the owner really needs to consider training his staff
great job,
laid back ambiance , not as most tribeca's places
the food is incredible we had the lamb and the cortada, total indulgence
THe wine list is all argentine
will definetely go back
Very roomy restaurant and nice food
Empanada, fish carpaccio skirt steak were delicious
Nice Malbec espresso too! Cool laid back environ
Why so empty though?
I do not agree with the previous reviewer's note
My husband and I visited the restaurant twice
Both times we were seated promptly, were never rushed to leave, the food was tasty, the wine was great value, and the service was attentive
I had ribeye the first time and Chilean seabass the second time and I liked both dishes
I think the steaks are good value at around $25
My husband had the skirt steak the second time and he really enjoyed it (he thought it was better than the filet he had the first time)
Our friend had the ossobucco and she also enjoyed her dish
Overall I think IA is a good addition to the Tribeca restaurant scene
We like the casual, modern interior, and the spacious bar/lounge area is a great setting
We will go back there not just for food, but also for drinks
Last night we went and the food did not let us down -- it is outstanding

I don't know why Citysearch lists this place as expensive
Their pre fixe combos are around $8, which is cheaper than a lot of places in NY
My girlfriend and I have been to Zen Palate several times
When we go out to traditional Chinese restaurants we usually order vegetarian anyway, and always wind up getting the same 3 or 4 dishes
At Zen Palate there is a great variety of vegetarian cuisine to chose from, all very good, and most at reasonable prices
We like the appetizer sampler, sometimes we order that as a meal
With ambiance that is serene and refreshing and a wait staff that is attentive and friendly, this is a great place to unwind
I go to ZP nearly every time I am in NYC
The place is tiny, but I love not being able to decide what to get
This doesn't usually happen to a vegetarian in Central PA
Great pineapple tea too! To me, this is vegetarian comfort food, gentle, hearty, not too spicy, and accessible to everyone, whether carnivore or herbivore
I had a truly dreadful meal there
The service was prompt but rude
The food didn't look good and tasted how it looked
The food is delicious here, the decor is quite nice whether your in the cafe are for a quick bite or the beautifully designed interior of the main restaurant
Service was promt and courteous
The food is delicious as it is healthy
(I highly reccomend any of the curry dishes!) This food trully satisfies the soul
and the stomach
Delicious and authentic Thai food but the shrimp pad thai is a bit of a rip off
I ordered take-out and was disappointed to see only one puny shrimp
When I called just to tell them, the woman said There should have been two! Two tiny shrimp in a dinner portion of pad thai! They should name it pad thai with two baby shrimps!
This place was recommended by NY friends so I went
I am from Hawaii where the Thai food is good, Pongsri was EXCELLENT! The price was reasonable
The service could have been better, but the place was PACKED so I understand
I can't wait to go back! I already recommended it to others
My husband and I found this restaurant in passing, but am so glad we decided to stop! The food was delicious and not overly spicy
I would definately recommend this restaurant to anyone!
Pongsri has a very large menu and uses quality ingredients
In addition to the usual things, they have a number of duck, fish and mussel and frogs legs items
I think their food is very good, although definitely catered to American tastes
Most of the curries are a bit sweet and I've never had anything here that I thought was particularly spicy, despite asking repeatedly
For these reasons, this is a good place to learn about Thai food, or to take friends who aren't used to it
As a theater-district value, it's right up there
I love Thai food
I made reservations at Ponsri based on the reviews at this site
My experience was totally different
Despite reservations we waited 15 minutes to be seated while others who arrived after us were seated first without reservations
We ordered two dishes - beef and pork #50 and #51 and both were tasteless
The food was a big disappointment
We did not find the waiter overly helpful
I will not go back
These people are so nice -- they go the extramile to help you!!! I would recomend them to everyone
-- The translator
The food is fantastic
The service is smooth and nice
The place feels like your in Thailand
It excellent to be in and eat in!
I first went here with my boyfriend and it has become our restaurant to eat in
We love going here and everytime we go we are never disappointed
The food is great the prices are great
The service is great and the whole atmosphere is very calm
The Tom Hka Gai Soup is great
esp if u love coconut
My boyfriend always gets the chu-chee chicken
even though we promise to try something new everytime we go
he just cant help it
and the big birds love nest is one of m y favs that i would say to have
plus u can eat the whole nest also
Great Restaurant
Prices are quite modest for midtown
Nice clean family place
The food was ok, not the best I have had, but for the price you pay for lunch, it is ok
Pad thai was good, the thai ice tea the highlight of my meal
SUM IT: affordable good variety of selections
Try it, same price as one of McDonald's value meal!!
I've tried quite a few, I keep coming back to this one
Very authentic and really EXCELENT food
The atmosphere is like or a little better than most typical NYC Thai sit-downs, pleasant enough to invite friends or a casual date but it's not a swanky first date type of place
If you find anything as good or better for authentic Thai food (plenty of good fusion places too) please put it in your review
This is a great find near Times Square -- decent prices, and one of the best Pad Thais I've ever had (they don't scrimp on the shrimp -- jumbo, not teeny)!
Every New Yorker knows that a decent, affordable restuarant in Times Square is hard to find
Luckily, we all have Pongsri
It's spacious and the service is good
The food itself is enjoyable
Believe me, it is a lot better than some of the other restaurants in the heart of Times Square like Pasta Break!
The Big Bird's Love Nest will not leave you hungry
Excellent food, great service and the best Singer beer in town !!
We were just in the city for a day, and asked a local security guard what he would recommend for a good Thai restaurant
We were so happy that he sent us here! We asked Tina, our hostess, for her favorite dish, and for the most authentic Thai dish they had
Her response was Any of the curry, and we were not disappointed! The shrimp were tender, and the curry is far more complex, flavorful and mild than any Indian-style curry
We were delighted! The staff was very friendly, and taught us to say cheers in Thai
Sounds like Chai-yo
Overall, we truly enjoyed the experience
Great Thai at a great price
The Big Bird's Love Nest was incredible
Service was fast and pleasant
I would skip dessert next time - the coconut mango custard wasn't great
I'm actually shocked that this isn't being rated higher than it is
This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Manhattan and I have never had a problem with the food, service, etc
The prices are great relative to the portions you get
Believe me, you should be seated promptly, despite the theater crowds
Try the pad Thai
it's true that there's nothing fancy or out of this world at Casa Di Meglio, but the food, the service, and the environment are all completely dependable for a good experience
I like to come here for a low-key dinner with friends after work, and I've also done larger family dinners here comfortably
The tira misu is yummy!
went to pre-theater dinner
food was good, nothing fancy
salad dressing was very good, however salad itself was lacking many key ingredients
main course was fine

For $4, the value was right on, but I found the chili sauce/ketchup to be very salty
It ended up masking the other elements of the sandwich
The meat, onions, and cheese were good as was the roll, but I'd go back if I could forego the sauce
Much hyped steaks will disappoint
A massive quantity of some type of onion soupy mixture is plopped on your Kaiser roll, along with ketchup (ketchup?!?), some spices, a speck of cheese and a a couple slices of beef (Steak-Ums, perhaps?)
Hints: Fried onions, BB, use fried onions
You want to enhance the flavor of the beef, not mask it
Also, Kaiser rolls are good for burgers and cold cuts, invest in some real sub (long) rolls
Add some more meat and cheese (for those who request it)
Basically, less condiments and more beef! Want a real steak sandwich? Go to the White House Sub Shop in Atlantic City or Pats or Genos in South Philly
BB translates into Big Bummer
The sandwich practically melts in your mouth
The second time around, it was just perfect --not soggy as it had before, and just the right combination of spice (chili ketchup) and smooth (American cheese), covered with the famous sauteed onions
The BB sandwich may not be a classic philly cheese steak, and it's too irreverant to become a classic of its own, but it really hits the spot
I wasn't expecting anything like a philly cheesesteak
I wasn't expecting it to be and I do not think that was their intention
I think they just wanted to create a new version of a classic
I personally was disappointed in the sandwich
My cheese was not oozing through the steak and bread
By steak was also not chopped up but just in layers on the hard roll
It wasn't very good
The hot pepper sauce was a nice touch though
We'd read the mixed reviews, but we live nearby and just went over to see for ourselves
A place that makes only one item should make it well
This place doesn't
The thin slices of meat are tasteless, overwhelmed by mounds of gloppy, fried onions and a strong (but not good) red sauce with a bit of melted cheese on the totally loser of a roll
Okay, the place has no atmosphere
You place your order and sit at a small table with a can of some beverage
That makes it all the more vital that the sandwich be tasty
This so falls short of the mark
It misses even if you've never had the authentic Philly sandwich
no, these aren't authentic philly-style cheesesteaks (nor are they meant to be), but they're good nonetheless, especially if you judge them based solely on taste and not on authenticity
when they're freshly-made (a rarity these days, unless you go early), they're incredibly delicious--i ate a bunch of them when the place first opened in march
unfortunately, in recent months the owner has given to making the sandwiches in advance and keep them warm in the oven, which makes them ever-so-slightly soggy
while they're still good, they don't quite have that *oomph* that a freshly-made one does
still, for $4 you can't complain, especially if you throw your authenticity hangups out the window
try coming here before noon--that way, you'll have a better chance of scoring a freshly-made sandwich while beating the lunch rush
I saw the lines pile up outside this place about a month after I ate there
My cheesesteak was so dry if you rubbed it together you could probably start a fire
I'm not from Philly, so maybe I just don't get it
but that sandwich just made me regret leaving my diet for the day
I did go based on a friend's recommendation
You want variety? Go else where
What you get for $4 is a tasty, juicy, delicious cheesesteak
Please don't compare to Geno's or Pat's
It's apples and oranges
Please stop with the Philly Cheesesteak debate
This is a $4 sandwich that is deliscious it has steak, cheese and marinated onions with a spicy sauce
Best priced sandwich in NY
Try one and you will be hooked!!!
Comparisons to the Philly cheesesteak are not the issue with BB Sandwich Bar
The food is pre-made, there is no selection and the sandwich, quite frankly, is nothing to write home about
The fact of the matter is NYC does not have one restaurant serving a decent steak sandwich
As a result, the novelty of BB's product has attracted an undeserved buzz
Unless BB addresses its aforementioned shortcomings, people will eventually see the Sandwich Bar as a mere fad
So many of the negative reviews about this place seem to be completely missing the point
Obviously, authenticity is not the aim here -- no one is trying to trick anyone into thinking that these sandwiches are representative of true Philadelphia cheese steaks
They're something else altogether and, most importantly, they're good
The space is no-frills, the service is no-frills (but in my experience never less than friendly), and one's dining options are no-frills -- that's clearly how the operation was conceived and that's clearly how it's being handled in practice
I can't help but think that all the naysayers are really pining after something the already excellent BB Sandwich Bar has no intention of being
Its ridiculous to call these things cheese steaks, and even more so to say that theyre better than cheese steaks
Although I grew-up in Philadelphia, Im not one to go so far as to say that the 215-area-code is the only place to get a good steak sandwich because while Tony Lukes and Pats and Genos and Jims and Lees and Mommas are meccas
White House in Atlantic City is great and even Papa Jakes all the way out in Los Angeles ranks up there in my book
HOWEVER, the sandwiches at BB only come one way (you dont even get a choice of cheeses), theyre on kaiser rolls instead of hoagie rolls, they throw a little bit of attitude into their service and they give you a wet-nap in the bag with your take-out order
Its worth the trek down the Jersey Turnpike to get a real cheese steak
A Philly Cheese steak it is not, so let's not call it that
It is a pretty good steak sandwich that is smothered in grilled onions, some sort of spicy sauce, cheese, and then served on a roll
It is worth stopping by if you are in the neighborhood, but I definitely wouldn't stand on some of the lines that I have seen outside the place during the work day lunch rush
If you want a cheese steak go to Philly
If you are in the village and want to try an interesting steak and cheese, come here
I've spent several years in Philadelphia eating more than my fair share of authentic cheese steaks
And BB's steaks don't even come close to the real thing
I'm not just saying that because I'm a Pat's Steaks snob
I'm saying that because you get BB's steaks pre-made, pre-wrapped out of the oven, and you can only get them one way
Plus the bread and meat don't even come close to the Philly creation
And they're very light on atmosphere
Very good sandwich, worth stoping by
Not your typical philli cheese steak
Good onions, spicy sauce, and nice bread
Service was prompt and the place very clean
Guess the other posting caught them on a bad day
The sandwiches here are Italian sandwiches on a kaiser roll, made from thin-sliced steak, peppers, onions and a bitty bit of cheese
I had read an article on this place and they were totally up-front about how you should not to expect cheesesteak when you come (I'm a cheesesteak expert and admit you pretty much have to go to Philly for the best of that stuff)
The sandwiches here were pretty good
They were not made to order (taken out of a warming oven), but sitting around lets the juices really soak into the roll
The place is bare bones so you may not want to to eat in
This is the kind of place you'd pick up a sandwich to go; eat it by the river, in a park or at home
Bring napkins -- thsi stuff is messy and gooey, but has a real homemade-taste
The sandwich is fine, but the disorganized way the restaurant is run will drive you crazy
Last time I was there nobody was cleaning tables and the same fellow that was cooking was taking orders, working the register and a few other things
He should have started with a food cart first and then worked his way up to a restaurant when he proved he could handle that

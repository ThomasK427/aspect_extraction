It's better for a night out with a few friends--it gets a little too loud if you're looking for a place to take a date for a quiet dinner
Overall, it's one of those places that I would recommend going to just to see what it's like, but not for return visit
I was taken aback by the inclusion of cheese in one of the sushi combos; turned out to be a pleasant surprise
In Short Patrons can relax with an Indian snack and cocktail in the plaza-level lounge, dine surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows in the 200-seated dining room, or throw a party upstairs
The menu offers both vegetarian and meat dishes that range from vegetable samosas and salads to gosht vindaloo, a fiery-hot lamb dish cooked in vinegar and spice
Desserts include ice pudding and mango mousse
I frequent indian restaurants a lot and this is the first time i went to utsav
The design of this restaurant is impressive compared to that of other indian restaurants
The service was slow at first but ended up being good at the end
The appetizers just weren't that inspiring and neither were most of our entr'ees
We did order the lamb which was great
They cook with just the right amount of spices so people who like spicy food will enjoy the after taste
Every other usual indian dish that we order turned out to be average
But then it came time for desert and that's where the surprise came
Their mango mousse was the best desert i've ever had at an indian restaurant and their kulfi was delicious
There are other restaurants that can deliver better tasting indian food but I'd recommend this restaurant to people for desert only
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time
The buffet had a nice selection
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes
Service was also very good
I would go back
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family
The food was good
The place was nice and calm
but the service was a bit slow
I had tickets to see a broadway show, and went to Utsav for for their pre-theater menu
Lets just say Dinner far exceeded the show that night, and that is a testament to the quality and service at Utsav
You definitly have me as a repeat customer!!!!
Food and ambience were excellent though a bit expensive
The service was just average (at best)
Overall I'd recomend though
not a chance in hell any indian person would consider this place worth the money they charge you
food is not good
service is just awful
I am pretty sure owners write the good reviews found on this site
I went with a part of 4
north indians and south indians mixed
food is totally tasteless
no one in our group liked it
service was really awful
prices are EXORBITANT
don't waste your money
plenty of good restaurants in this great city that will give you better bang for the buck
This was a great surprise
With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room
The service was attentive
I look forward to eating here again
I cant believe this place is still in business,Food stinks,Service is worst of any restaurant in NY
Waiters are insulting,The few good reviews below must have been written by the owners
AWFUL
The food was really bad
cold
and i had to wait for 1 hr just for the food
and the place was half empty
Ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention
I care more about the food and ambience
Everything is excellent, the menu is quite extensive, and you eat with a view on both sides of the city
Try the Times Square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka (also available without vodka
)
We just got back from this place and can say the service and food was great!! wasn't sure about the previous review regarding service as we have been here a number of times and the service we have received has always been very good even for NYC standards
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer
It took them ALMOST AN HOUR to bring out the entrees
The lamb meat was under-cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL
They never came back to refill our glasses again
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES
Food was great! An Indian friend was so impressed he thought it was better than food in India! A little pricey though
I went here and had the rudest service EVER
After the first appetizer came, the waiter came out and brought a second plate of the same first dish
We told him we'd ordered one of each and he went back
The manager who took our order comes to the table and proceeds to adamantly tell us that we did order 2 of the same dish
We told him politely that possibly he had heard us wrong, and if he wanted to charge us for it, then go ahead
He began arguing, saying its not about the money but you did order two
And we said, is it worth arguing about? We know we ordered one, if you want to charge us for the second dish, charge us
And he said okay and walked away
Any restaurant that treats its customers like this is not going to do well for long
If you're a fan of Indian snacks - this is the place for you! Mouth watering chaat items, south indian snacks - you have so much of it, you're too full to move on to the entrees
Let me start by saying that I eat Indian food at least once a week
I travel every week so its always in a different part of the country
I can honestly say that while some of the dishes I have had at other places I might have rated on an individual basis higher I have not enjoyed a total dining experience more
The service A+, The food A+, The ambiance, excellent for a romantic evening in NYC
I visited Utsav in June, enjoying everything from the Utsavpolitan (mango and vodka) cocktail to the mango dessert
I had Machli Masala as an entree and it was wonderful; the fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was just the right combination of savory and spicy
The atmosphere is especially relaxed and comfortable; the window seats are great
The service was average, though I've experienced much worse
I would not hesitate to recommend the restaurant to friends and will return
i'm shocked at the bad reviews others have posted for this place
i've been going to utsav for nearly 3 years and my only critique is that the service is sometimes lacking
otherwise, i highly recommend the lunch buffet (great value) -- quick, good and guaranteed to induce a serious food coma
This place has got a great setting, nice dining room and lighting but they've totally missed the boat when it comes to service and food
We were there to sample the menu for a reception and WE were ignored! No one even offered us water
When we finally did get a sampling of the menu, the food was cold and bland
The tandoori shrimp tasted spoiled
I think these guys are so taken by the appearance of their restaurant, they think attentive service and good food shouldn't matter
They're wrong and eventually this new fare will fizzle once word gets around
The food was excellent - we have tried both the al a carte as well as the buffet - and regardless of the meal - each dish had a distinctive flavor and was not greasy at all
The service too was very good - the staff were attentive
I have recommended this restaurant to several of our friend and acquaintances and I have still to hear a negative review
Utsav is IMHO the best Indian restaurant in New York

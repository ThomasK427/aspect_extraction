The wine is heavenly and the service spot on perfect
Long live Babbo
This is the best Italian Restaurant there is ! , Amazing gourmet food , wine and WOW
the desserts are amazing
Make sure you get reservations a month ahead
You can beat it when they wash out your wine glass with a bottle of the same wine your bought
Try to save your appetite for dessert
Can't miss that!
Have wanted to eat here for several years, based on the food's reputation
Babbo did not disappoint
All four diners shared 4 different appetizers and pastas
Items as diverse as the sweetbreads, tripe, beef cheek ravioli and roasted beet salad and house made salumi
Every dish was beautifully presented and the flavor combinations were inspired without being pretentious or over-wrought
Beef cheek ravioli is the essence of beef wrapped in fresh pasta - outstanding
Service note: accomodating and pleasant, but not as confident as I would have expected
My wife and i had been tryin to secure a reservation at babbos for a couple of years until this tip to NYC when we successfuly made a 9pm reservation
We were seated and promptly and the wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive
While i can't say we were rushed it did seem that the didnig expereince was somewhat hurried as our appetizers appeared within minutes of placing the order
I had the lambs tounge and found the dish very good
The beef cheek ravioli on the other had just didnt stand out and was somewhat disappointing
My wife had the buffalo mozzerella(fantastic) and a goat cheese tortelinni which she loved
Overall the food was nice , the service good but i think my expectations were so high i left just a little bit disappointed
We will try again next trip if we can secure a reservation!
I chose Babbo as my birthday dinner restaurant
What a mistake
Perhaps my expectations were too high after constantly hearing fabulous reviews as well as being a fan of Mario and Joe
The decor was lovely
The service was outstanding
But, I went for the food
which was so unsatisfying
I ordered the traditional tasting menu
thinking it would give me a good sampling of several dishes
Well
there were many courses, but most were bland, some left a bad taste in your mouth, some had an odd mix of flavors that didn't compliment each other, and a few were okay
just okay
I expected every bite to be an experience I would never forget
I thought this was going to be an exciting culinary experience
To say I was disappointed is an understatement
You can find a much better dining experience elsewhere for the price you pay at Babbo
I went to Babbo to have dinner with friends and had the best food I could dream of
Not to be missed: grilled octopuss and steak
The most delicious and cooked to perfection steak I have had in my life
Service was great
ask for a table upstairs though, it's nicer and more intimate than the downstairs ones
My girlfriend had taken me here for my birthday after waiting one month to get a reservation
Upon arriving, our hostess had checked our coats and seated us promptly
We were seated upstairs, and our waiter and the sommelier were both very helpful and friendly
We had taken all of the suggestions from the waiter which were the Pumpkin Lune to start, for Primi we shared the Papardelle, and the Spaghetti with squid ink
Our secondi I had the grilled pork chop and she had the braised beef with porcini
All of which were amazing
For dessert the Saffron panna cotta is perfect
I would definitely go back, and I would without a doubt recommend any of my friends to dine here for fine italian dining
The one month wait was definitely worth it
Went with my father without a reservation, and the maitre d' was very nice and sat us within 15 minutes of our arrival - we had been told that the wait would be an hour (this may be unusual)
The service was impeccable and only added to the food which was exquisite
The waiter and sommelier were very helpful and not at all snooty as some other reviewers may have indicated
The signature beef cheek ravioli is a signature dish for a reason - it was quite remarkable, and the pecorino cheese was the perfect complement
The wine list was very extensive, covering many Italian wines, and the waiter made a great suggestion for us
The desserts were good but not great; however, the espresso was unusually fine
The hype is for a reason
Do not wait to make a reservation
Just did not do it for me
I thought I would love this
Very dissapointed
Went there based on the ratings and reviews here on Citysearch, and could not have been more pleased
The service was outstanding, the lamb chops were tender
didn't need a knife
the dessert was tremendous
Know that us regular folk that don't have connections, must make reservations a month in advance, and they begin to answer the phone at 10am
Do it, you won't be sorry
Don't waste time, go now
This place is outstanding
They take food to the next level
Great wine list
Very nice, but nothing-fancy decor
Make reservations
They do have  an area for walk-in's but you really don't want to sit in that area
Great waiters who are knowledgeable and passionate about what they do
This restaurant was so highly recommended and so hugely disappointing to a group of people who are not unfamiliar with fine dining
The wait staff had absolutely no grace or enthusiasm
The menu might have well been written in a foreign language and the wait staff didnt have a translation dictionary! There is no sommelier for a wine list that requires one
As we were left to decipher the menu on our own, the meal was mediocre at best
And after such a let down there was no need to order desert
A quick exit to find an elegant finish to a lousy dinner elsewhere was unfair and inconvenient, but absolutley necessary
How utterly embarassing to host and hype a restaurant to international guests! Lastly, our deepest sympathy to those seated right next to the coat check
Needless to conclude, a waste of money and such a shame
Mario, FOCUS
I'd have to urge the pasta tasting menu with matching wines
One of the greatest meals I have ever had, and waiting for each beautifully presented course is like waiting to open a christmas present
We had to wait a little longer (according to the waiter, not us) for a course and they gave us a free dessert and filled our wine glasses more than necessary
It may look expensive, but in the end it is a bargain for the experience
I had a fantastic meal here, one of my best in new york city
everything from the delicious food (go ahead and order something that sounds unusual--it's bound to be good), to the advice of the gifted sommelier to the elegent surroundings lived up to its reputation
be sure and reserve two months in advance to guarantee a table
they do take walk ins but its at the bar and the very crowded tables next to it
The service was terrible
Our reservation was lost, and the host was extremely rude and unapologetic about it
The food was okay, but not phenomenal in any way
The atmosphere was ugly -- pretentious patrons and staff
Overall, an utterly mediocre restaurant not worthy of the hype

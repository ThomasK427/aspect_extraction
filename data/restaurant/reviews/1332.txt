The portions were small but priced accordingly
I loved the salt cod pasta and fish broth as well as the fig tartlet
I would definitely go back
I've already been twice
I'm also a Prune fan, and I'm happy to see that Matt has hatched his own little egg
I can't comprehend all of the work it takes to open one's own place, but the effort shows! The food is interestingly tasty, especially the sweetbreadpoppers
The drink list is exceptional
The staff takes Uovo seriously, without being pretentious
Were some of my choices a little too salty?
maybe another bottle of wine would have quenched it, but I saw no reason to have extra salt at the table
Our drinks were DIVINE, in a city that's filled with bad, musty draftbeers and overpriced wines, we left very happy
The kid at the table next to us had some fancy art and crayons for coloring, and seemed to enjoy the little fried fish
All in all, I know I'll go again, despite the first user's review
See you there!
I am a HUGE Prune fan so, with high hopes, tried Uovo I must say I had a meal that not only met my expectations, but surpassed them
We had a delicious pork belly that our extremely wonderful server recommended
It weren't too sure, but loved it paired with the homeade kraut
We also had a beautifully presented grilled Asparagus dish that was almost too pretty to eat
I had the barbeque brisket that came with the best barbeque sauce I have ever had
It was smokey with a bit of sweetness
I sampled my friend's monkfish with shell beans and found it delicious and very fresh
Matthew Hamilton knows what he is doing! I loved the food and thought the space was very comfortable, I really loved the green Our server was a lot of fun and made the night even better
I can't wait to go back!
We tried Uovo Saturday at 6pm, finding it empty - one occupied table
The hostess kept me waiting 10 minutes (attempting to read seating chart which I assume was in cyrillic) before determining whether she could seat us
Made to sit at the bar until the other person in my party arrived minutes later, I was seated after being told we'd have to be out by 7:30 because of another reservation
Close to walking out, we stayed b/c chef's reputation
Our server recommended unique dishes that didn't disappoint
At a few minutes past 7, there was a kerfluffle between our waitress and hostess (who didn't want us to see a dessert menu)
Hostess finally brought it, saying if we wanted dessert, we could move to another table
!? This, while there were 3 other occupied tables
Check please, idiot
If they replace this moron, it's worth the trip
Otherwise, steer clear
I've read other reviews, and whole-heartedly disagree
I went to Mercadito last weekend, around 7pm, and had one of the most enjoyable NYC dinners I've had in a long time
I think it is a perfect blend of small size, outstanding service, delicious food, and even more delicious drinks
Our server, Nicole was a sweetheart
She was super-attentive, even when it got crazy, and everything she recommended was superb
I think the price is on par with the neighborhood
We had tacos de carne and tacos de camaron, and the three-guacamole
I personally don't like to mess with the original, but the mango and pineapple guacamoles are pretty tasty for the unconventional food lovers
The drinks! I don't like alcohol, so I tried their refrescos! Yumm
they are muddled fruit with soda water and some sugar, and are worth it
My partner had some beer concoction that he loved
All in all, it was a great evening and I highly encourage you to try it out
I went on the rave from another friend, but I do not see the allure
The guacamole was like soup! THey served my friend her drink first and I had to wait 15 minutes for my margarita ($15)
Then, they served her salad and main course and left me waiting for my shrimp tacos for 35 minutes
One of the chefs came out and apologized and said it would be right out
10 minutes later, it still hadn't appeared but eventually, was served by the chef himself who profusely apologized and comped the plate for us, even though we didn't complain
The waiter and chef were gracious and sweet, which I will not forget, but nor will I forget the $15 margaritas whch were served in glasses the size of Dixie cups! So if you are hungry, thirsty and like good food, steer clear
If you like nice people but don't care about any of the above, go right ahead!
A friend I went here on cinco de mayo thinking it would be a great choice- wrong! They opened later than usual because they were not set up
We were able to sit outside, which was the only pleasant thing about this experience
However, the food was too expensive for what you got and it was mediocre
While the margaritas were tasty, it took forever to have them served
I waited 45 mintues for my last drink and had to order it three times
When we spoke to the manager about it, she made excuses about she didn't have enough staff or something
You manage a RESTAURANT lady- if you can't actually serve people, then close
I was underimpressed by her sob story
we sat outside at about 6pm on a warm tuesday night, and had the whole place to ourselves
the service was great for most of the evening until the place got packed at about 8 -- then our waiter got a bit frantic and scattered, but was always friendly and helpful when we could grab him
the fish tacos and guacamole sampler (with fresh homemade chips) are fantastic, altho the portions could be a bit bigger for the price
the margaritas are heavenly, especially the one with cucumber juice -- upgrade your tequila from the well stuff, and you'll be very happy
Service is non-existent
My friend ordered a coke 3 times that never came
I ordered something only to be told 15 minutes later that they actually were no longer serving it
I then ordered another dish, a frittata
30 minutes later, I get something like a fried egg on top of nachos
When I tell the waiter that that was not what I ordered, he argued with me
But what was interesting was not that he disagreed with what I had ordered; he claimed that what I ordered was what was in front of me, when it was clear that there was another menu item that perfectly described what was brought out
I asked him to take the food back
No apology, no offer to get me something else
The food looked decent, but unfortunately I wasn't given the opportunity to find out if it tastes good as well
The food and margaritas here are very good
You may be deterred before you get to that point, though
The restaurant is triangle shaped, very small, and very tight
The restauarant is all windows and was already too cold for comfort in November, wore my jacket the whole meal, can only imagine January
Drinks were creative and tasty, but the glasses were small to start, plus ice and muddled limes in the margarita, left very little room for the margarita itself
Finally, the food arrived, and our initial take was that the tacos were tiny - but that was quickly overcome by the fact that they are delicious
Fried oyster appitizer was enough for a meal, delicious
Skirt steak entree was very good, as well
Overall, worth trying, but look for perfection in the food, not the atmosphere
Definitely make a reservation! No bar to wait, they'll call your cell
i almost never complain about service, but my experience here warrants a full-on tirade
food is incredible, but without friendly and prompt delivery, who cares? first off, we were seated 25 min after our 8pm reservation
then, 3 out of 5 orders came with something messed up
instead of apologizing and fixing the dishes, the waiter tried to convince us that we'd like it better the way he brought it
when we remained firm, he behaved as though it was our fault for ordering s/thing different than what he brought
finally, we finished our meal in 1
5 hours, but our waiter told a group waiting that we were taking our sweet time finishing, which was causing their table to not be ready
absolutely unacceptable considering that we had been seated late, given the wrong dishes, and not been given the bill for at least 15 min after we finished
GROSS!
I was a big fan of the village location and this is just as good
Service was great, food was better
I didn't try the drinks but I will be back
Congrats Patrick! ;)
I just recently visited Mercadito's new restaurant in the West Village and it was just as good as their Avenue B location or even better
The tacos were amazing (try the shrimp), the ceviches tasting was great, the whole fish was out of this world, the cucumber margarita was really good and the service was very attentive and friendly

However, the waiter was awful and when I asked for the manager to complain about the service, the hostess pointed at our waiter! I couldnt believe it! My first time dining at Max was fine, but my second and last time at Max was so bad, that I was so ashamed and embarrassed that I invited my friends to try this place out with me
I will never dine there again and I hope the proprietor of the restaurant fires his manager/waiter after reading all of these common complaints
I would in a heart beat!
Wow, I just left Max, and must say it was nearly the worst dining experience I've had in years
The hostess made us wait for a party of 3, and the dining room was nearly empty (after 10pm)
When we were sat they put the 3 of us on a 2 top with a folding chair for the third person, even though there was 2 empty tables next to us
We asked if we could use the table next to us, seeing a still empty dining room, but they insisted, NO! The entire time we dined at this cramped table, the placed remained empty and the smug waiter was nowhere to be found
The worst service ever
Food was average, wait was long, and the service
terrible
Don't bother
went last night and it was so good! it's cheap, and didn't wait long for a table, and had some good italian wine!
I have been going to max since it opened few years ago, but every time i went there the food and service got really worst
Talking to people they all think the same
I wanted to try a last time and unfortuantely for max it will be my last
The service was really bad even if the waiter was nice the only 2 times he came to the table, we had to pay for an extra dish that we dind't want
I left very unsatisfied with the food
where has this place been hiding? i was walking around my neighborhood, looking for a good cheap italian place when i stumbled upon this tiny spot, packed with people shoveling pasta into their mouths
figuring they must be on to something, i went in
the $9
95 rigatoni with meatballs and sausage ranks as one of the best pasta dishes i've ever had, at any price
bruschetta was tasty
slow service, but well worth the wait
I like this place, I REALLY like this place
This is what Frank used to be, before its charm and essential goodness began its downward spiral
Having said that, I have to say: more lamb in the lamb ragu, please! It's no fun digging through that delicious spaghetti and sauce, trying to excavate for specks of lamb
The salmon with capers arrived charred on the bottom, underscoring its potential for greatness
The service is a little flaky as well, but the overall package is one I willingly accept, as long as they don't go the way of Frank
I've been hearing about this place for a while, but I don't know why
From start to finnish, every thing was OK, just OK
The service left a lot to be desired, to much beautiful peopleattitude, the food was decent, nothing to write home about
I thought the room was done well considering it's about the size of my closet
Nice wine selection though
Wasn't impressed by this one
Waited too long for a tiny table, waited too long for a waiter, waited too long for a simple, basic bowl of pasta
paid too much for wine
OVER RATED!
as a san francisco native, I am use to exceptional food at good prices, and on my recent visit to the city some friends wanted me to try MAX - well, we all had an amazing meal
I would descibe the cuisine as coastal itialian meets french decadence
I had the black seafood ravioli - to die for - and my boyfriends lasagne was so potent and desnse you could not stop eating it or at least until he was completely filled
You have to try this place once!!!!
These people with silly rants about ungracious behavior have obviously never been to Italy
I loved this place! The food was beyond belief; expertly delivered pasta blessed with an orthodox Italian al dente
The stoic waiter was polite without being overtly gracious
He left my wife and I alone, without ignoring us, to enjoy our meal
Oh yes, and the price is right too
Not a back-alley mugging like the majority of east village hold outs
Visit if you have the moxie fellow brethren
Best italian in New York
Friendly waiters and service
I go 3 times a week
it's excellent value
and the freshest ingredients
whoever says it's not good, doesnt know good italian food if it hit them in the face
anyway, it's better for me
i dont have to wait too long if most people don't get there
Love the food and the atmosphere
Be prepared for a hangover from the cheap wine - but it's worth it!
Bad service, and the food-is authentic italian supposed to be cold inside lasagna? My lasagna was cold inside, and watery
I also tried the fettucine but whatever, it's ok
I have yet to find anything to compare to the level of food that Max has for the same price range
They have the best gnocchi I have ever had
Highly recommended!
I've eaten at Max twice
The first time, the food was absolutely amazing
I thought it was just as good, if not better, than Lupa
The other time that I ate at Max, it was disappointing
Mainly because I'm vegetarian and I ordered a special that the server told me was vegetarian -- and it came with sausage
Ew
Then I ordered something else and it wasn't that great
Still, I would recommend this place
It's not very expensive and my FIRST dining experience here was VERY memorable
If you dare to venture into LES, fight the yuppie crowd, and put up with the long waits and marginal service, you will be rewarded with extremely good authentic italian food at very affordable prices
This is not the place to bring your clients or your mother, for that matter
but it's a great place to hang out and enjoy good food with your friends
The food was the freshest, lightest, most authentic Italian I've had in a long time
Fresh pieces of basil and tomatoes on everything
The only problem was that they pretty much leave you alone, even when you want the check (just like Italy!) Decor is sort of homey, with mismatched tables and plates
Not a good place to go if you want a quick meal, but by far the freshest and most authentic in the neighborhood
I've eaten at Max numerous times and have mostly enjoyed the food and service
It's reasonably priced and pretty good (it's no Babbo let's face it but it's also about 1/8 of the price)
Last Monday I ate there for the last time! Two tables were smoking in the front dining room during our meal
If you've eaten there you know how small and cramped it is
Instead of asking them to put out thier cigs, the manager brought over ashtrays! Also we discovered they have no dish washer machine and just rinse with cold water and re-stack for the kitchen
I have been here a few times over the years
The food is always very good, it does have a homestyle cooking feel and is good value
The service was good (I've always been here early in the evening) but I can believe that it would great crowded at the peak times in the evening (like every other NYC restaurant)
On the upside: The accented waiters are usually handsome and flirtatious - at the very least friendly
The food is excellent, with phenom appetizers, a good wine list and more than reasonable prices
On the downside: There is always a wait
It is frequently full of people who have had WAY too much wine
The hostesses, though lovely to look at, are petulant and not good at their jobs
Overall it's totally worth, a must if you live in the area
I have never had such a horrible dining experience
The staff was incredibly rude
We were seated in the most uncomfortable, high traffic position
A passerby spilled a bottle of red wine all over my boyfriend and I
No one apologized to us
The waiter told us it was our fault for moving the table
In the previous position, I kept getting hit in the head

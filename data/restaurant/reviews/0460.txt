My one complaint was my $17 shrimp noodles
which had no actual shrimp
There were a few crumbles of shrimp chips (which I only recognized because of my Asian background) with a couple bites of noodles
My husband's appetizer was better in size, taste, and value
Main courses were an adequate size
Service - average
we had the nine course tasting menu
chef added loads of salt
meat segments were extremely fatty
not worth the price
First off, if you are looking for Chicken Parm or a 40 oz
porterhouse don't bother going to this restaurant
If you are willing to experiment with food that is on the cutting edge then you went to the right place
The pairing of ingredients are unusual but they work
The lamb and shortribs were great (the portions are not that small) and the porkbelly was even better
The desserts were the biggest treat of the evening
The desserts were presented like little works of art and once again the unusual (for dessert) ingredients work well together
I recommend the parsnip cake and the lemon curd
Overall a great experience if you know what you are getting in to
The decor is depressing, the food is bland and in extremely small portions and the desserts are easily resistable
what are they thinking?!! I was on a date and could not wait to leave so I could go home and have some cereal to appease my hunger despite having had all three courses
this place sucks!!
The people at WD50 are very friendly, welcoming and unpretencious
The service is flawless and the waiters know their food inside out
I recommend the tasting menu it's $95, a great deal
The contrasts of flavors and textures are awsome You will not be dissappointed
The wine list is small but solid
The decor is modern and warm
At the end of the meal, the chef's father gave us a tour of the kitchen
A real treat all around
BRAVO!
I came here when I was visiting New York recently, and really enjoyed my meal
My friend and I were seated next to this couple, who we ended up chatting with and then hung out together the rest of the night
The food was very inventive and different, but it really worked
Our waitress was very helpful in making recommendations and in pairing wine with the food
I very much enjoyed this restaurant and would recommend others to try it
then this restaurant is for you
What a colossal waste! I went there for dinner for a friend's birthday and, after three courses and over $300 later, left hungry
The portions are painfully small
To be fair, the niblet of food that I was able to eat was delicious, but I find it completely ridiculous that I left there so hungry that I picked up food on the way home
Having heard so much about this place, I chose to eat there for my birthday with my boyfriend and it was just awful
The prix fix menu was 95
00 per person and we did the wine pairing which was an additional 65
00 per person and each course was a BITE OF FOOD! Literally
One bite of caviar, one bite of meat, one scallop, one bite of chocolate mouse, and poof--a 400
00 dinner! We eat out all the time and have gladly spent hundreds of dollars on a worthwhile meal but any restaurant on Clinton is better than this
Please do not waste your time or your money to go there
First of all unless you arrive in an armored car with security guards stay out of this neighborhood
On arriving you are transformed into a different world (one that belongs in a different neighborhood)
The prices are outrageously high, the food most average and the portions smaller than even that French can dream up
The neighborhood does offer a wide variety of bodegas on almost every corner
Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time or money at this definite disappointer
Yes, this is an expensive restaurant, and yes, the portions are on the small side, but they are not ridiculously small
You will be satisfied, though not stuffed, assuming you ate a normal breakfast and lunch
More importantly, the food is so incredible and obviously labor intensive that you will feel it was worth every penny if you are looking for a delicious and truly innovative meal
I especially recommend the chicken entree with mole paper
On top of the dizzyingly excellent food, the service was perfect, and the cocktails were unbelievably delicious
being in my hood this place excites me, its a culinary expierience with out selling out, great new flavors to taste, and decor thats just fabulous
my gf and i went to wd-50 for dinner
out of six dishes we tried, five were excellent
i have to give it up to wd for trying new ideas
pork bellies and lamb were particularly nice
the venison and ice cream starter was a let-down, probably because the deer should have been warmed enough to melt the fat and bring out some of the game/saltiness to offset the ice cream
but like i said, you can't say they didn't try something new
and for all you nay-sayers who complain about not being full, have a nice stroke and thanks for raising our collective health insurance costs
I have been to many a good restaurant in NY and WD-50 was on my list of to go to places
Unfortunately, I was not impressed
The place itself is cool and chic and attracts a very diverse crowd but the focal point of a restaurant is its food and WD-50 missed badly here
The chef tries to use too many weird ingredients and the recipes just don't work
Now granted, we only tried 1 appetizer and 2 entrees but they all missed the point
The seafood was tough and a little fishy and was relatively just blah
The have a decent wine list and some interesting cocktails and the dessert was excellent
The service was also excellent but overall, I would not go back
The chef should try to tone things down a little and use more everyday ingredients
Also, the menu selection is somewhat limited
from the typical eatery
Much needed combination of good food/casual ambiance
Admitedly a bit formal for the neighborhood, but way more laid back than most other restaurants serious about their food
Dishes are expertly prepared, with unusual combination of ingredients that usually work; the few misses are laudable, nonetheless
Wine list is all over the place but consists mostly of reasonably-marked up, but not necessarily inexpensive, prices
If you know your wines, you will at least appreciate their efforts (how many places dare have an Austrian red wine, particularly on small wine lists?)
Service has been either good to excellent, depending on the server
Dining here is a plesant, off-the-beaten path experience
Bring your microscope with you to view your entree before eating
Gees guys come on
give me some food already
Chocolate paired with duck liver? It was awful
But the topper was dessert
Balsomic vinegar drizzled over my vanilla ice cream
I actually paid money for this slop
Our experience at the much-hyped WD-50 was very dissapointing
The food portions were super small, which, ironically, was the good news as the flavor, texture and smell of of the dishes was very poor
The octopus was chewey and stale, the cold squash soup tasted mostly like flour (it reminded us of a bad soup at a wedding banquet), the skate was dry, and the salmon was way too fishy (and raw even though we asked for well done)
We will never, ever go to that restaurant again
Big Mistake
Went there for my birthday on a recommendation
To be fair, the drinks we had at the bar were delicious
However, the food portions were small and neither of us were impressed by our entrees
In addition, the waitress brought us the wrong bottle of wine (a much more expensive bottle at that), and charged us for it even though we pointed out her mistake
Won't be going back

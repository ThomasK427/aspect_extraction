Le Bilboquet, won me over very quickly
For a few reasons, including its location, service, and ambience
People that have been to France, or are French by nature will easily find this as a very romantic and discreet reminder of home
The food was just enough, the prices are standard for the neighborhood, and the ambience is understated and tres romantique
No complaints at all
Speak French, and you will be a friend with everyone at this place
The worst experience I've ever had in a so-called French restaurant
- The service is terrible (the waiter is only here to take your order and give you the check)
- The food is wwwwaaaaayyyyyyy too expensive for what it is (and I know food, believe me!)
- The reason why I don't recommend that place is because you basically get kicked out once they've judged you went over the time limit (no matter how much you're spending!)
It's really not worth anybody's money
Personnally, I felt humiliated, disappointed and I feel bad for French people
sincerely! How Rude, how snob
this place really sucks!!!!!
Good food (steak tartare awsome!) and nice service in a nice ambience but why tables are too near and little and how is it possible to pay coat check in a restaurant? I've never seen it in all my life! Good people but don't expect a value place as you will definitely order an high priced bottle of wine!
waiter was personable and helpful, otherwise, fairly disappointing
overpriced food (I chose a goats cheese salad - the cheese was dry and overdone, and the salad over-dressed), perpetually harassed to move more quickly - check presented before we had even had a chance to ask for coffee
the setting is cute, but the crowds loitering by the door and therefore hanging over your table are a bit off-putting
The restaurant was a find
Wine was exceptional, waiters - funny and personable and quite witty
service impeccable and food - phenominal! I had the file migon and it's some of the best served steaks in the city
Espresso, however, was tolerable, didn't have room for dessert, but hopefully next time
my lunch turned out to be a 4
5 hour retreat to Paris
how wonderful!
Best steak tartare in town
Been a fan for more than 15 years and always stop by especially for lunch when travelling
An ambient little spot that I hope will stay for many years
We arrived and we waited for a table for 5 minutes
The people in this tiny gem of place are smart in making people wait since they offer a drink for the parties that wait for more than 15 minutes
The maitre'd was very nice and waitress is very friendly, she even gave us free champagne! The food was excellent as well and nice crowd
kept us waiting for an hour, repeatedly promising '10 minutes'
when we finally sat down the food and waiter were excellent
The Scene A 16-foot-tall Buddha lords over this 12,000-square-foot, multilevel spectacle where, even after five years, bodies pack every inch from bar to bathroom
Though there's no dancing, throngs of midtown workers and trendy tourists bring out their inner club kids to the thumping deep house music
The Food The pan-Asian menu could easily become an afterthought in such a scene-centric spot, but Chef Rick Laakkonen runs a reliable kitchen
The satay of Chilean sea bass brushed in miso, shrimp and green beans in a bright XO sauce, and crunchy spring rolls generously stuffed with duck are impressive, but most of the menu falls short, as with lackluster wasabi-crusted filet mignon and flavorless deep-fried lobster dumpling
Desserts, like the giant fortune cookie filled with light and milk chocolate mousse, perfectly embody the spirit of this over-the-top spot
I went to Tao with high expectations
I was visiting from Atlanta and made the reservation one month in advance
We did not have to wait long for our table, but from there the service went down hill
We sat and sat until finally someone came for our drink orders
Then we asked about the menu and we were given an answer that made us feel like we were bothering him
When the food finally came it was just average
Never did the waiter come back to see if everything was ok or if we needed anything
Finally after being ignored for 45 mins
I had to go to the bar twice to get us new drinks
When the waiter did came back he brought the check without asking if we wanted coffee or dessert
He was mad that we did and we ordered both
Again to never get a coffee refill, we called a manager over
That did no good, because we still did not get a coffee refill nor did the manager come over to us again
We felt as if the manager did not believe what we were saying, and if he did he was not going to anything about it
I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone
When you pay so much for a meal that is just average and the service is terrible and the management does not care you do not recommend it to anyone
DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!
So, I went here for a birthday and was pretty excited because I'd heard a lot of good things about this place
I was not prepared
I went hoarse trying to talk over the incessent drum and bass music (really, its not neccesary to have it THAT loud, you can set a mood without deafening people)
The food was good, but nothing so unique as to warrent such a high price tag, same for the drinks
We had brought cupcakes for our own dessert but since we knew our 'Happy Birthday' song would be drowned out by the music, decided to go to another bar to have more drinks and do it there
I would day this place is best for drinking at the bar before a night of clubbing to get you in the mood
If your hungary or want to have a converstation, save your money and your vocal chords and head somewhere else
Tao is the kind of place that def gets alot of hype, in some aspects may not live up to it according to other reviews, but this is a place that you have to go to knowing exactly what you want to get there
My boyfriend and I have been to TAO on numerouse occasions and the food was always good, it is true that many other places in NYC offer the same ambiance and decor, But TAO def
Stands out with a great bar scene, wonderful drinks (MOJITOS ) in particular and the BEST BEST BEST dessert (The fortune cookie), as far as the appitizers are concerned, GO for the Seaweed sald, which is unique in offering many variaties of seaweed over ice in pretty ample amounts
Unlike other restaurants of its kind in NYC the portions are shareable and actually fill you up if you come hungry
As far as the service, it all depends on the waiter waitress you get, but going to posh places like this a hint of snobbiness can always be expected
Overall the place is great for some appitizers, drinks, and ambiance:)
My wife and I were visiting New York from Boston in July and had heard good things about this restaurant
We were disappointed
We ordered the sea bass and the duck spring rolls to start
Both were average
I then had their chicken and my wife tried their salmon
The chicken (Kung Pau, I believe) wasn't bad, but I've had similar food at PF Chang's for a lot less
My wife did not like her salmon and barely touched it (it was dry and looked disgusting)
When she told the waitress, the waitress simpoly smiled
Another dish was not offered, it was not taken off the bill, NOTHING was done
I believe we saw our waitress speak to the manager and he decided that it wouldn't be worth it to do anything about the bad dish
We eat out all the time and were shocked that a supposedly fine restaurant that is successful, would not try to make the customer happy
We handled the situation by not leaving a tip (the approximate price of the salmon) and making a note on the credit card receipt as to why we had a problem with the service
I also spent 45 minutes on my main course so that they would have to wait to turn the table around
AND I'm writing this and other reviews online
What a waste for a restaurant to mishandle an unhappy customer in such a manner!   We also felt extremely rushed
All appetizers came very quickly and were quickly removed and the entrees also were served way too fast
The portions were small and the prices high
The ambiance is nice, but I've seen the same thing and Budha Khan in Philly and Buddha Bar in Paris
New York has so many great restaurants, this is not one of them
Great ambience and amazing crowd but eat before you come!! absolutely no variety for vegetarians
and even my date thought the food was not as good
But worth it for late night drinks by the lounge
wear your best accessories though
you wanna be seen here
I have been using citysearch for a while now and never felt so compelled to write somethig until now
TAO is one of those places that gets so hyped by word of mouth and does not live up to any of it
The ambience is OK and the food is sub par for the prices
The best part is the bar area and of course the drinks are super expensive
I don't mind paying a decent dollar in a place that really delivers and TAO is definitely not one of them
If you have a take out asian place that you love, it's most likely better food than TAO
I've been to Tao numerous times--for cocktails, dinner, or lunch
The best deal is their prix fixe lunch special which always leaves me stuffed and never having to eat another big meal throughout the day

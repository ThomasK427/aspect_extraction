If you are looking for a scene go elsewhere, if you are looking for great tasting cuisine, tasty signature cocktails, and a laidback yet refined casual atmosphere--this is the spot
Me and my girlfriend had a great appetizer of scallops w/ a celery tartare and cauliflower puree which was so tasty, as was the Halibut entree
The drinks rocked also--I had a passionfruit margarita and she had a fresh blackberry martini
Great music too---not trying to be some super cool trendy place w/that techno garbage
It seemed really informal, there was no hostess and the bartender met us at the door and seated us
This place really isnt a scene--and I think thats why we stayed
Its a nice place to have in the neighborhood
We'll be back for sure
Voyage is absolutely a great unexpected surprise in the west village
the food is excellent and decor is fabulous
It reminds me of being in Paris or London
My friends and i love this special place
We went back again for Brunch and enjoyed it even more
My girlfriend and I loved the coziness of the room
Better than home! Scrumptious fresh fruit mojitos creative cosmos! The idea of returning with friends for a happy hour drinking cruise sounds like a plan
We loved the Sashimi Tiradito The Tuna Empanadas
Both were fresh and inventive
The Ham Hock is the best dish I have had all summer! My girlfriend loved her Wild Salmon
Save room for dessert! They rock
Even though is hot out, the warm apple french toast was a total comfort experience
Megan, my girl, found the Capuccino Tapioca refreshing and a cool contrast with the espresso granita and candied almonds
We had a brief wait at the bar for our table, but the staff was very hospitable and engaging to insure that we enjoyed our experience
Recently I went into Voyage with my wife and we were treated to an absolutly wonderful evening
The service was casual and friendly while also being efficient and helpful
The resteraunt itself is beautiful, (we really liked the photographs in the dining room), and most of all the food hits the mark, (the oxtail croquets and ham hock are a must)
If you haven't had a chance to visit this West Village oasis just off the beaten path, you owe it to yourself to do so!
We walked into a coxy chocolatey brown room
The bartender welcomed us with fabulous blackberry mojitos, yummm!  When it came time for dinner, we jammed on some yellowtail sashimi that would shame Nobu! The oxtails were as good as everybody says, ya dig?  Gotta have, and gotta love that Ham Hock
Honking good food
My friends all ate fish
They raved over the shrimp cashew pesto, and the Salmon with spring veggies
Do not, I repeat do not leave without trying the Fried Pie or Pistachio-Strawberry Rhubarb thing
It is the working
Server was sweet, southernfied and helpful
My boyfriend and I (having little to no spare time to ourselves) ate at Voyage last night on a good friend's recommendation
I have to say the night was flavoured by moderate prices, efficient service and exceptional food
I had the Gulf Shrimp which was a like pleasure bomb exploding in my mouth (what's in that sauce?), while my boyfriend ate the very tender lamb chops! The chef really excels in his reinterpretation of Southern cuisine
Besides the very apparent lack of air conditioning once I entered the women's bathroom our night was seamless
We're definitely taking another trip back to Voyage
Won't last
We ordered the spoonbread appetizer, salad, snapper, and free range chicken entrees
All were mediocre to poor
The spoonbread was bland, and the chestnut dumplings that came with the chicken weren't like any dumplings I've ever had in NYC
They were cold, flavorless balls of mush
The waiter told us that we had ordered the most popular dishes -- there was only one other couple in the dining room, so that wasn't saying much! If that is the best Voyage has to offer, I'll go somewhere else
Very enjoyable meal, good food, well prepared, tasty oxtail starter, good fish, service was friendly and efficient and wine-knowledgeable except for hostess who insisted on seating us in corner with 2 other couples when room was empty, and refused to budge from her pre-arranged seating plan
Apart from this clueless and blinkered seating architect, you will enjoy yourself and eat well
Voyage is a great find! The atmosphere was laid back, romantic, yet upscale
Their service is at a good level, very attentive not at all overbearing or rude like some have commented
The cuisine is inventive and delicious and has a southern flair
Where else would you be able to get some gumbo? A great bet for an appetizer would be their oxtail croquettes
My only complaint is the cut of meat for the hanger steak, which turned out to be somewhat inedible for my tastes
But overall, the experience was very enjoyable
Great food, awful, rude hostess
I won't go back because of her alone
She immediately tried to sit us in the bar (smoking section) rather than the dining room, and even at the worst table, right by the door (where her boyfriend was later asleep, we noticed on the way out)
Service otherwise was friendly, but the hostess should be immediately fired
I've already eaten here twice
An exceptionally good and original menu, albeit a bit heavy
Definately NOT a place for picky eaters
If, on the other hand, you eat everything, this place will tickle your fancy
Inspired combinations, a classy decor and really attentive waitstaff
They also have a fireplace, which is good because the place gets cold
My wife and I have been living in the Village for 20 years now and we stumbled upon Voyage the other day and decided to give it a try
We were both very impressed
The menu was very inventive and reasonable
We each tried a specialty cocktail and they were quite delicious
My wife had a passion fruit margarita and I had a mojito, and for a drink to ween me off of my usual single-malt scotch, it had to be good
The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgable, and when we finally sat at the table, our waitress enthusiastically explained the menu
I had the free-range chicken and dumplings, and my wife had the salmon, both were filled with taste and nuance
Voyage was laid back, sexy, yet upscale---a place very much needed in our neighborhood
My wife and I will return with friends
Welcome to the neighborhood!
Excellent flexible and imaginative menu at this cozy West Village find
(So new there's still some construction going on)
Enjoyed the food philosophy, but it was maybe emphasized a little too much by an over-eager waitress (the only knock on the place!)
Otherwise great wine list and exceptional food at very reasonable prices
What more could someone want?
The Scene A young and lovely crowd noshes at candlelit tables and a long, brick-backed bar, while world music swells under the room's soaring ceilings
Hanging lamps, oversized black-and-white photographs and breezy European servers add to the stylish vibe
A gleaming stainless-steel kitchen reminds diners of the restaurant's serious culinary sensibilities
The Food The menu shuns courses in favor of fun "tastes" and "shares
" Start with a half-dozen tapas: Meaty marinated fresh anchovies, cheesy-rich mushroom croquettes and grilled chicken kebabs, fragrant with lemon and cumin
Fusion-inspired tapas, such as wasabi-honey poached garlic shrimp, show off the talents of the San Sebastian-trained chefs
The generous cheese and cured meat plates are nonpareil: Piquant Cabrales and smoky Idiazabal are tempered by sweet fig confit, while jamon Serrano, lomo (lean dry-cured pork loin) and paper-thin chorizo shine on their own
Made-to-order paella, chock-full of chubby saffron-Calisperra rice, shellfish and vegetables, easily feeds four
Nice little Tapas place hidden in Tribeca
When ordering, ask the waiter about the oil content on your choice
All of the dishes had excessive oil
It might have been our choices
We didn't expect the steak pieces to be drowned in olive oil
Save space for deserts as they were amazing
Get both samplers, they're worth it
I had an amazing time, the service was the best, very caring, and informative, a great selections of dishes, perfect for sharing
great wine selection and the best tasting sangria
ah i almost forgot to mention their awesome Mojitos
ill definetely come back
We've found the best tapas in NYC! The service was friendly and fast, the food excellent, and the Spanish wines were amazing
I was very impressed, and so were my guests
The Gambas Pil Pil, sizzling garlic shrimp, was the favorite, yet the seasoned mushrooms were also a surprising treat

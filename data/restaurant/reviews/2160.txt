, no table cloths, small but clean)
Located in an area that has few choices for dining so it is a God-send for locals
It is inexpensive, authentic, and a BYOB place (good for large groups trying to keep costs down
Dinner for 11 people ran about $20 per/person
I agree with the last reviewer that the older couple that own and run the place can be abrupt (depending on who), but heck at these tabs and convenience a little abuse is a small price to pay : ) Highly recommend the honey glazed ribs and the salt and peper shrimp
Stay away from the Mai Fun Noodle dishes as they are bland and not as authentic as they could be (the cook, probably a family member, tones down the taste for local palettes)
recommended to us by locals for the food and price, but we will not go back since the owner not only insulted us publicly, he preceeded to talk about us to the next table
Highly unprofessional and rude service!!
Wonderful, consistent food; try the salt and pepper shrimp and snow peas leaves w/crab and pork in lettuce leaves
Pleasant atmosphere; the place to go for the food, not the service
To eat: Salt and Pepper Shrim, Young Chow Fried Rice and Apricot Chicken
I've been going to this place for as long as I can remember
The people are rude, but you'll be to busy chewing to notice
If you are in the City and just want a basic good meal you can NOT beat Scotty's
24 hours with everything from eggs to steak and seafood and everything in between
Jose will cook anything to exactly how you like it
Its not fancy - that is why its called a diner! but it is very good, affordable food and an excellent choice worthy of being considered
If you work in midtown, and you're not eating the amazing salad greens with fresh made-to-order falafel and humus, you're blowing lunch every Friday
A special shout out for the cauliflower too
Who knew it could be my favorite vegetable???

I'll use them in every ocasion, and would reccomend Delectica to everyone who's looking for quality and great atmosphere

I rate Shaheen far higher than the popular Curry in a Hurry down the block
More time to choose what you want; very good appetizers and good specials
I recommend shami kebabs--minced lamb and lentil patties; chicken tikka masala; dhal; chicken meatball special
The sweets are a marvel to look at--but are far too sweet for my tastes
Make sure you ask them to warm up your dish
Open late--often till 4am
taxi driver hang out, excellent food, a bit oily on the curries but overall great value for money
I just moved from NYC to Charlotte, NC and the thing I miss most are Bagels More's fresh bagels every morning! They are perfect - soft on the inside and crispy on the outside
And all of their cream cheeses are freshly made
The guys who work there are so friendly as well, which is a rare find at most shops
I highly recommend this place!!!
I've NEVER had a better bagel
Well, there was someplace in North Jersey, and another place out on Long Island that were at the same level, but this place is tops
They're made on the premesis and get one freshly made in the morning (get there before 9:30!)
I have just found my new bagel place
Although they left it in the toaster a little too long
this was the best everything bagel I have had in a long time
and they put the seeds on both sides of the bagel--always a special treat
I love this place
It's not even a half block away from me and the sandwiches are all fantastic
I have a circuit of about 8 sammies that I rotate through, and they are all great
Corned beef, pastrami, chicken cutlet, to name a few
I get a Reuben on a roll routinely, and it never disappoints
I work around the corner
They have the best chicken noodle soup ever!!! The broccoli and cheese is great too
They make things to order and a buddy of mine always goes in and asks what's good? and comes back with the best sandwich of the day
They are friendly and prompt
It took a while for them to remember me but other than that
its the best deli around
Bacon, egg and cheese
They deliver
The coffee is bad and it sometimes takes an inordinate amount of time to place your order, but they actually show up
It is what it is
The Scene There are no rules at Sarge's: It's open 24/7 and serves every kind of food--from potato latkes to chicken and ribs--to every kind of customer, from businesspeople at breakfast to recuperating club kids at 4am
It looks like an old-style Jewish deli, with cheeky waitresses to match, but it's really a crossroads of all of New York City
The Food For the most part, Sarge's New York classic menu is first-rate
The best dishes are the sandwiches, like the triple-decker fantasy of corned beef, tongue and chopped liver, and the traditional deli entrees, like beef flank simmered in mushroom-barley soup
Breakfast foods, especially omelettes, are good as well
Like any restaurant that attempts to cook everything, however, there are hits and misses--the fried jumbo shrimp are surprisingly good, but barbecue ribs are predictably poor
Sarge's is an old school Midtown gem, a survivor from the days when such delis were common in almost every NYC neighborhood
The food is at least as good, if not better, than the big name delis the tourists flock to in droves, and while it would be nice for Sarge's to get the extra business, the fact that Sarge's is a bit of a secret means you're unlikely to be stuck behind some out of towner asking where Meg Ryan sat or what the difference is between pastrami and corned beef
This is the NY deli experience the way it was meant to be
I love the tongue sandwiches, grilled hotdogs potato latkes w/ apple sauce
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars
otherwise, good stuff for late nite eats
black white shakes came out good also
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!
The pastrami is really good and I love everything else
It is so good that I forgot what other food they had
I will definitely go back
We saw a actress named ruemchlahaman or something like that from the golden girls
The service ambience and everything else is excellent
Truly, don't waste your time or money
They lie about how long the food will take to arrive, usually 1-2 hours i
e
cold and soggy, and then they are rude to downright hostile when you complain
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion (and price)
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square
The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes
Lunch came with pickels and slaw, no extra charge
It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too
Late nite omelletes are not good here, there is no variety! They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant
They used shredded cheese on top! I will not be coming here at 3am again
Nice place though
Was there Friday night
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous
And I've been to many NYC delis
My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better
If you want a quiet place with amazing food and high quality tea and coffee Keko is amazing
Of the many cafes in NYC this is one of the best
Everything is made in house and the tea time is delicious
And the homemade cous cous is out of this world!!! Everyone should spend at least one afternoon at Keko
This is the kind of place that has yet to be discovered by someone who strives for the best coffee in town; not the bread, not the food, not the place but the coffee
This place is truly the best coffee you can get in the big apple

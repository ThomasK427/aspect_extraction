This is a great little spot that is condusive to great conversation
In Short Towering twin stallions and carved wood screens add majesty and mystery to this stylish restaurant, where well-dressed patrons sip martinis at the bar and families with children feast around large tables or in spacious booths
The menu gives Chinese classics a contemporary tweak; dishes are artfully presented, with many sauces made tableside by servers
Signature plates include diced chicken wrapped in cool lettuce leaves, orange-peel beef with chili peppers, and wok-fried scallops with lemon sauce
Oh my! I brought a group here for a bachlorette party
what could be more fun than drag queens? The service was rude and the bill was twice the price I was quoted over the phone when I made reservations
We had to wait 45 min to be seated
I felt so bad for bringing a group of 11 people to pay almost $100 each for a poor tasting dinner
Take-out would have tasted better!!  Instead of going to a fun lounge after dinner, as planned, everyone had paid so much, that we went to a dive bar for the rest of the night for cheap drinks
A ruined night!
Snooky's cakes are phenomenal! I ordered a superman cake which had the body piped in chocolate with a superimposed photo of a head
Not only was it beautifully done it tasted like a homemade cake

This is one of Manhattan's small treasures
There is the timelessly delicious Red velvet Cake that will make you believe that Cake is good after all! The Wedding cakes are done with orginal artistry and high class at 'I'll take that' prices
Get the Chocolate cakes, the Key Lime pies and anything else
The only thing that this little gem should provide but doesn't- is running shoes! Snooky's Forever!
Valentines Day without a Valentine had me blue - until Snooky's chocolate cake
Unbelievable treat sure to satisfy your sweek tooth any time!
The Scene There's nothing fancy about this joint, where the line for takeout often dwarfs those huddled at the three patio-style tables
Red and yellow walls, fake greenery and a cooler of Snapple round out the decor
Despite the crowds, there's no rush to hustle you out the door
The Food A faithful re-creation of the classic banh mi sandwich draws the crowds
Served on a wonderfully chewy roll that yields easily to the teeth, it's a pleasing mix of savory meat (pate, ham and pork) and sweet pickled veggies (carrots and cucumber), plus a touch of cilantro and moderate dollop of mayo
Insist on sliced jalepeno for the requisite kick
It also comes with chicken, pork chop, sardine or portobello mushroom, which can't compare taste-wise to its meatier cousins
The bland, limp summer rolls are not the shop's forte
The fresh tangy lemonade with lime, however, is a must
Didn't know what bahn mi was before coming to Nicky's
Now I know
tasty vietnamese sandwiches
Spicy if you like that
Small place, more of a takeout place, but there are about 3 tables if you need to eat it right there (which you might)
Never too crowded, and you can walk in and get your sandwich within a few minutes
Highly recommended for taste and price
It was a while ago, but when I say the food here was incredible
I mean INCREDIBLE
Like there should be a warning label against addiction
Like there is a strong possibility you might lick the plate
And I'm a vegetarian - think of everything else I didnt have
The decor is a little lacking, unless you fall for the light/bright colors and designs they try to pass off for tropical
But who cares - the food is so **speechless**
And add to that the price they charge, you still come out WAY ahead
friends and i split orders of stuffed eggplant [good], spinach salad with mango sauce [very good] and tart pork ribs [amazing!]
everything was delicious, including the sangria [available in pitchers]
the decor is bright and festive - from beautiful, colored paper lamps and ecclectic salt and pepper shakers, to the awning over the bar that makes the indoor dining space feel more like an outdoor cafe
slightly difficult to get waitstaff's attention when it came time to pay the bill, but we weren't in a hurry and they were accommodating about our sharing
We were so excited when we saw this place open
We were so disappointed at the food
As tropical as this place looks, its a huge poser for a Cuban restaurant
The food leaves much to be desired
Based on the choices (there's mac and cheese on the menu?!?) There isn't a decent side of rice and beans to save your life here
The drinks are the only saving grace
I gave it two chances
When they change the menu and the chef, maybe I'll return
I still have to travel outside of Brooklyn Heights to get excellent Cuban food
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO EAT CUBAN FOOD!
We had a great time here
We sat outside and had two huge salads
What a value! You can read my full review at Scoutsider[dot]com :-)
The restaurant is small, but very well decorated with a romantic, eccentric feel
The food is outstanding, salads, sandwiches, and pasta, and the tuna steak was superb! We order about once a week (faster for pick-up), and eat there about once a month
Great wine, too!
The space is small but the servings are not and the owner takes pride in his food
Everything is prepared and served with care
I'm a teacher who works in the neighborhood and whenever I go to lunch with a friend I make sure it is at Angelina's
The Scene Though plenty of white-washed tables and chairs are scattered about the dining room, it's the bar that acts as a neighborhood gathering place
Couples, friends and singles convene around the dark wood bar and mingle over reasonably priced tap beers, well-mixed specialty cocktails and a steaming plate of mussels or fries
The Draw While the prospect of an uninterrupted game of pool and foosball in the downstairs rec room sounds appealing, the bright, white space feels a bit harsh at 3am
Better to stay upstairs and order another round off the cocktail menu
A freshly pulled shot livens the espresso martini, while pomegranate syrup adds a hint of the fruit to the smooth vodka-based pomegranate martini
The menu of salad, pasta, sandwiches, sides and other bistro fare is available until 3am, with daily specials
I love this place! It's cheap and tasty, and some of the waiters are really cute
The Bloody Mary I had this weekend was a little too spicy for my liking, but my burger was cooked just right
I've also had the most of the pasta dishes and sandwiches (ok, I go there a lot!) and they have all been really good, too
I need to know where my server was
As soon as I was seated my server diasapered and never ask if i wanted something to drink
After i waited 20 min my server came back and ask if i wanted something to drink but to his surprise i had already had my drink since i had to ask the busboy for it
When i wanted a second round my waiter was standing next to the bar eating
The busboy handed me dessert menu and even took my order
Then he handed me my check because my waiter was busy eating again with the other server
When I was leaving my waiter said thank you while he took a skewer out of his mouth
It will be a long time before i give this place a second chance
People if you want to eat on smith street try this place last
Baddish food, slow, unfriendly service -- why bother? So many good places to go in a few blocks
Just went to Apt 138 again last weekend and it reminded me why I swore I wouldn't go back
As usual, it took almost an hour to get food (a burger and pasta, not something complex that might take a while), and when it came it was tasteless
The waiter finally came by after the first half hour to apologize for the slow service, but never offered a drink, dessert, or anything to make us feel like they actually cared we had to wait so long
I can be patient for good food, but with so many better choices in this neighborhood, I can't imagine going back to this sub-par joint
Take your money elsewhere for good food and they'll probably serve you faster, too!
Our meals were served to us promptly and were delicious

Great menu for such a small place
and yummy stuff
not all vegan -- I had canadian bacon and real cream cheese
Staff was cute as hell but very disorganized and slow
Though small, Teany is a really nice place to just hang out and catch up with friends
The wait staff is really friendly and they always seem to have a smile on their faces
Teany has a huge selection of teas and some excellent vegan fare
I'm not vegan, but I tried their desserts not expecting anything special
their Chocolate Peanut Butter cake is GRRREEEEAATT!!! (a la Tony the Tiger)
Mind you
I like chocolate and peanut butter, but this cake really surprised me
I'm not even sure how they got the thing to be so moist
=)
I was brought to TEANY by a friend who swore that it was great
I was not let down
The teas were both abundant and fabulous (which came in open loose tea bags)
I tried 4 different types and loved them all
The food was amazing (Turkey Club!, all kinds of pie, platters) (and I'm not a veggie or a vegan)
If you're in the Lower E
Side and there is a table available, go to Teany!
Moby's teany IS teeny, but luckily the Saturday night we went it wasn't too crowded
I was going to get the chai latte, but figured since I always have that at other places, I would try one of the dozens of teas that are so wonderfully described
I got the almond tea, and it was delicious, as was the vegan peanut butter cake (actually, that was more like heavenly)
Great music, very laid back
Cool place to just hang out
I wasn't sure what to expect when I first headed to Teany for a snack--being a vegan I've made it a point to check out every vegan restaurant in New York
It was smaller than expected, and in a slightly unusual neighborhood
how New York! I wasn't really expecting much from the cafe-like menu and the smallest kitchen I've ever seen
But the food was really excellent, and the atmosphere and decor was kind of cute, despite the claustrophobic quarters
Unfortunately the pesto salad was so big and so good that I didn't have room for any of the vegan desserts, which looked great too!
everything on the menu is excellent and has a homey deliciousness! the sandwiches are a fav
service is always fast and the staff is great
BUT THE DESERTS ARE AMAZING !!!! they are the best in this price range in NYC
stop by and hang at Teany for a while - you won't be dissappointed
This place IS very teeny
Decor and vibe are cool, but laid-back
Moby was there, being very unpretentious
We got middle eastern platter and turkey sandwich
Turkey sandwich was very tasty
Middle eastern platter was OK
I'm used to traditional middle eastern food, but this was a bit different, esp
the tabouleh
In addition, the olives appeared to be out of a jar/can, i
e
, they were already pitted
I expected better olives
There's a whole section in the menu dedicated to tea
Therefore, I was surprised when we ordered a pot of tea, and were given a pot with a tea bag in it, as opposed to a pot with loose tea
I definitely expected loose tea, considering the fact that tea is such a big part of this place, and considering the kitchen had shelves of those small airtight storage containers, which I assumed were for the loose tea
I had so much fun when I ate at Teany
I'm not into Moby's music but his restaurant serves an awesome Middle Eastern dinner platter!   Plus if you're the type that can't drink coffee this place is a godsend!
and i don't even care about moby
i am there at least once every single weekend
then i am up until 4am from the caffeine
but i have a designated waitress and she is grrrreat!  i highly recommend: the turkey club, cashew butter sammich, peach ginger drink, chai latt, forest berries black tea and strawberry rhubarb pie
and ANYTHING ELSE
this place has teas that are impossible to find elsewhere in the city
try the white tea
you WILL love it, i promise
and yeeeees, i have seen moby there
but moby-stalkers, please stay home and eat mcdonalds
I know absolutely nothing about tea, but I've had a good luck with the great breakfasts at Teany
The Teany Bagel is delicious! If you're not a vegan (and I'm not even close), don't sweat it
You won't miss a thing; I didn't
Very friendly and cheerful staff
The outside seating is great for people watching, yet romantic enough for a date
The food is AMAZING and I was quite impressed with the sangria
I love how the food is really fresh, the portions are generous and well presented
the tea selection is so extensive
the food is good too- big fresh salads and tasty sandwiches
Teany definitely has a great tea selection
I enjoyed an iced herbal tea and a cherry streudel on a hot afternoon
I went on a Sunday afternoon and I was one of two people in this teeny place
I hope it was just quiet because everyone's on vacation since I'd like this place to stick around a while
I don't know about all of the dinner disaster reviews I've seen, but Kishti is the place to be for a great buffet lunch
The food is very fresh
One side of the buffet is vegetarian, and the other has meat seafood
They serve you fresh naan, and the service is pretty fast
The price is a steal for such great food! It's one of our fave lunch spots!
I went to dine at this restaurant on thursday, we had to wait 30 minutes for an order of tandoori chicken and an order of chicken Tikki Masala, to my horror the tandoori chicken was all raw, if i want to eat raw food i go to a sushi bar not an indian restaurant, although the manager and the waiters did apologize to us that does not make it right
I have read your reviews and it seems that i am not the ony one with the problem of your tandoori items
shame on the managment for not taking care of the problem
Qucik question what is a bartender
for one he is not on the phone every 10 mins and he does not disappear on you every 15 mins
This was the case on a recent visit to your restaurant and is not the first time that this has happened to me and my friends, when you guys do improve let me know and i will come back
We loved the original dishes, especially the tuna and the salmon tikka
The spinach dish was superb as well
The chicken tikka did not arrive for at least 10 minutes after all other dishes were on the table
Also, they kept dropping forks and knives on our table so we suggest that the servers receive additional training
Getting teh check took a while but all in all we would definitly go back
Excellent food
I was passing by your restaurant the other day and decided to come in for drinks with a few of my friends at the bar
(some time mid week) i came in and sat down at the bar
it took the bartender 5 mins to even notice that we there, as he was busy chatting with his other customers that were sitting at the window side of the bar
I guess that one needs to be a regular customer to get any kind of service at the bar in Kishti
so much for making new customers
huh??
I got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago, I was in your upstrairs dining area
We were a group of five
The portions of the food that came out were mediocre

I would recommend this restaurant to one and all if you are looking for one of the best steaks in the city
This place ranks in with my top NYC steakhouses, along with Peter Lugers, and Angelo Maxies
This place is amazing
I came with a group for dinner and we had a superb meal
The staff was helpful without being overbearing and the food was delicious
After dinner we hung out in the lounge, relazed and had a few drinks
It was a perfect night out
This is definitely not your typical steak house
The atmopshere is great and the food is fantastic! The steaks are tender and juicy and the sides are all delicious
I came here with a party of 6 and everyone loved what they ordered from steak to fish
The drinks are great and they have a few huge martinis to choose from that can serve the whole table
The service is prompt and courteous
Although this restaurant is off the beaten path, it is well worth the hike
We had a great dinner at Dylan Prime
The drinks were big and fabulous and so was the fondue and the steak
Our waiter was top notch
One minor complaint -- no privacy in the bathroom! Your fellow diners can catch you en flagrante whenever the door opens
Went to Dylan Prime for a b-day party
It was superb
I have never had a Filet Mignon taste that good, ever
I was also really amused by the chapeaux (hat) you could pick for your steak
Don't miss out on that
What a disappointment
I have been to this restuarant several times since it opened and always thought it offered great food, service and ambience - NOT ANYMORE! From the moment we arrived things went downhill
We waited 45 minutes for our reservation
Our appetizers were served cold, one of which was fondue
The steaks were dry and laking in taste
Fish that was supposed to be well done was served medimum rare
It was so disappointing to look forward to a nice meal out and then have it turn out the way it did
I will not return!
Great atmosphere but is not even in the top 5 New York steak houses
NOT EVEN A CLOSE 6th
Was very impressed with Dylan
While I was there, Bono stopped by
Take your date here, and you will be sure to be closing later that night
I first went here about a year ago, on a second date with my current gf and we had the greatest time
It was dark, romantic and stylish, but not pretentious
The drinks were great, we were both treated with great respect and the waiters had absolutely no attitude problem (common to many places like Dylan prime in price and aesthetics)
Anyway, I also found the place functions well for larger groups as I had dinner there in celebration of graduating from law school in May and with a group of 8 people thought at least one would not like it
Wrong, they all loved the variety on the menu and appreciated the non-attiutude (some of my guests were from out of town and also found the service to be quite friendly)
Way to go dylan prime
a new classic
Oh and, the steaks are great
This is a great date place
It's romantic without being cheesey, with great food and wine
Service was wonderful and I had no problems getting a reservation
Friendly service, great menu and good location
You have got to check out the wine list to complement your dinner selection
My husband and i went here for our anniversary and we both agreed that we had the best steak ever, the cocktails were great too!!! In addition to that, the service was impeccable AND friendly, not an easy find in NYC
Wasnt cheap, but you can pay more for less elsewhere
Dylan's is great for a large group or a romantic evening with your honey
The beef was good, but not out of this world
The scene was a lot more hip than the dark formerly smoke filled caverns known for steak in NYC
Hands down Dylan Prime is by far the best in the city - the service is wonderful with professional waiters and the atmosphere is delightful
The food is wonderful and I can honestly say that I have never had a better filet
I made a special trip for the Mohito
and the peach bellini
and the steak tartare
and the bread pudding
I went to Dylan Prime last night
The food and the service was perfect
I highly reccomend Dylan Prime
I can't wait to go back!
Whether your looking for great steak or just some phenominal drinks, Dylan Prime is the place to go
Aside from there mouthwatering steaks there lounge menu which include scrumptious beef-wellingtons and the best calamari I've tasted is uncomparable
Listen, I hate to knock at TriBeCa restaurant because we should support lower Manhattan but this isn't evene in the top 50 Best Restaurants in Manhattan! (Just ask the far more reliable Zagat's, at least they were reliable until they changed THEIR voting method to the web
) At best, it's a mediocre Wall Streeter steak house
The steaks are good but the atmosphere leaves much to be desired
And I don't need a huge martini, I need a GGOD one! City Hall Restaurant, right down the street, is a much better bet ALL the way around!
Dylan is a great place to take your love one's or even chill with your row dogs
The bar and the womens are hot, so if you looking a place to chill and have fun Dyan is the place for you
Fabulous restaurant in every way!!! It's a little difficult to find, but well worth the hunt
The best aspect of Dylan Prime is that it's a perfect spot for a first date, a business dinner, a casual night-on-the-town or even just a quite bite at lunch
The decor is intimate; the service is crisp
And the food
delicious!
I am so glad to see Dylan Prime getting the attention it deserves, I have enjoyed this restaurant from the moment it opened and watched it improve to the point that I think it deserves to be with the top restaurants in this city
The service is great, the food is outstanding (love the carpetbagger steak) and the bar scene is as good and any of the new hotel bars if not better
Keep it up

This place has a little something for everyone
Good atmosphere, good service, dynamite wine selection, a great pre- and after dinner cocktail lounge, and, of course, great food
In the past 18 months I have been no less than 10 times, for all kinds of reasons: business, family, friends, and dates
It just seems to work for all occasions
How can you miss with a table mojito and fondue before dinner, and enough choices to keep even the most ardent red-meat hater happy? Personally, I almost always get he porterhouse when I'm there
I cannot recommend Dylan Prime enough
There is something for everyone
This place earns its spot on the top of the list for best steak restaurants
Probably the best steak I have ever had, extremely juicy and tender cuts or meat
Service was excellent and the ambience is perferct for a business dinner or a romantic date
Hard to imagine this restuarant is receiving such high ratings - it is a disappointment all around
The decor is 80's Businessman, the food is uninspired and mediocre and the service is atrocious
Plus, everything was ala carte! There are far too many excellent steakhouses in this city to waste time with Dylan Prime
I heard such good things, but they turned out to be only rumors, false ones
This restaurant did not live up to expectations which were not to high to begin with
It took forever to actually get drinks and food
Overall, a bad experience
Nevertheless, the food was good
Coming from a person who considers dining a total experience and not just the need to survive, I find Dylan Prime consistantly exceeds my expectations in ALL of the components that comprise a perfect dining experience
From the always courteous and professional staff to the outstanding, perfectly prepared classic and unique menu choices

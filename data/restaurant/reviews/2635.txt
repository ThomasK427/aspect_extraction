The Tomato and Eggplant meal was spaghetti with a cold chopped tomato on top
BY FAR the WORST dining experience I have ever had in NYC
Fortunately the hostess was nice enough to take our appetizers off the bill after we complained
the food was fantastic, and yes, we did have to wait after we got there even though we had a reservation (think of it more as a seating window, you'll sit within 20 minutes of your time
of course we were mostly waiting for our guests, who showed up 10 or so minutes late
;) did i mention the food was fantastic? do the prix fixe, it's totally the way to go
i had the giamberetti fra diavolo, or however you say shrimp with linguini in spicy red sauce
could've been spicier, but the flavor was great and there was a ton of good, fresh shrimp
the service lagged once we had gotten the entrees (took forever for my ladyfriend to get another diet coke, and we almost gave up hope on them taking our dessert orders in time), but all in all it's highly recommended
I dined at Da Rosina before a show
The prix-fixe menu was affordable and offered great taste
I was so happy with this restaurant and its service that I came back after the show for a little desert--chocolate mousse, the best on restaurant row!~
This place is a fabulous place to go for dinner whenever you are in the theater district
Unlike some restaurants in the theater district, Da Rosina, will not break the bank
The food was superb' the waitstaff are trained to understand that the patrons have to make the opening curtain so they try to accomodate you when you have only a short time to eat
I also had dinner there when I was not attending the theater
The expereince was just as good
Highly recommended
My boyfriend and I ended up at Da Rosina after showing up at Cara Mia's between their Lunch and Dinner Times
Thank God we did because it was one of the most pleasant dining experiences we have had in a long time
Not only was the wait staff extremely attentive but the food was unexpectedly superior
I had the Lobster, clam, calamari, and shrimp marinara while my boyfriend had the sirloin
Both were better than we could have dreamed
Did I mention the endless supply of warm, melt-in-your-mouth, crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside italian bread? Tiramisu was a bite of heaven, and chocolate mousse played with your pallette
Do yourself a favor and dine at Da Rosina's the next time you want a top of the line meal
I was lucky to find this Italian restaurant on the row
After trying many places, Da Rosina does a great job of getting you tasty food and a very reasonable price
I no longer have to take my chances when seeing a show
This is now my favorite restaurant in the midtown area
The pre-fix menu is an amazing deal, give it a try, you wont be disappointed
My husband and I ate dinner at Da Rosina 5/3/03 and had a very pleasant experience
After being given a bad table at Becco and leaving there, we walked around and decided on Da Rosina because the price was right and the menu looked good
The fixed price Dinner was 19
99 including appetizer, soup or salad, the entree (lots of choices), dessert and a glass of wine
We had the Calamari, veggie antipasto, two veal dishes, flan and chocolate mousse and all were very good
No compaints here on anything, service was very friendly and competent
Da Rosina is by far the best restaurant on restaurant row
I have tried many places before, but now I will only go to Da Rosina
It is perfect for before shows dinners, and the fast and friendly staff will treat you right!
My party for seven last saturday night had the prefect visit at Da Rosina
First of all, everybody was so nice
We arrived 20 minutes earlier than our reservation time and they kindly made room for us in ten minutes
Even though the place was jam packed, the server took his time with us, explainging what the Veal Rosina came with and how the prix fixe menu would save us money
He also helped us select a wine which was delicious
I ordered an extra portion of Tiramasu to bring home to my husband just because it was the best I've ever tasted
I will surely be back at Da Rosina
I couldn't imagine them ever having an off night unless maybe the chef was absent
Everybody was happy with their food, and on our way out we met other parties who were return customers and loved the place
All I can think after reading other reviews is that it must have been an off night at Da Rosina
The bread was dry and stale
My fiancs salmon was over cooked and had a mustard sauce that we honestly thought was Guldens
My pasta dish was at least edible but seemed to belong in a cafeteria buffet
Mousse for desert was very good but was followed by 'Folger's Challenge' coffee
I was so disappointed that I made a note at dinner to go out of my way and write my first CitySearch review
Would be glad to speak to anyone from the restaurant about our expereice
We'll be back to Da Rosina soon
We loved everything! Everybody in our party of six left very happy
In fact, I think everybody had a wonderful evening because of the experience at Da Rosina, not because of the show
I thought that the pre fixe prices were tood good to be true, and I was right
I couldn't believe that I was able to get a compelte lunch for 14 bucks! And on top of that, the food was incredibly delicious
The pasta was homemade and tasty
The tiramasu was the best I've ever had
From appetizers to desert, Da Rosina really is an excellent dining experience! Every person in my party of 11 left very happy, and we all plan to return soon again
I visited Da Rosina with a tour group but returned shortly after to dine again this time with my family
Since, my in-laws, cousins, and coworkers have all visited Da Rosina before the theatre
Everyone has been very happy
On New Years eve in fact, we had reservation at a supposedly high class restaurant, but all of us kept talking about the food at Da Rosina
Thank you for having a really nice place to visit
My husband and I return to Da Rosina every time we visit New York City
It is always dependable
When we eat out at other places, we are never compeltley satisfied
At Da Rosina, the staff is friendly, and the food is outstanding
All this at a great location, and at an unbelievable price
We will keep coming back for more
Keep up the excellent work!
We didn't have reservations and we waited outside by their outdoor heater for forty minutes
But once we got in, the long wait was worth it
The price is unbelievable for the amount and quality of food
This prix fixe dinner that is only priced at $22 is probably a $70 value in most other places
Everybody we met there was friendly and very happy with Da Rosina
We will surely return and reccomend it to our friends
I can't belive how busy Da Rosina is and the staff is still extremely friendly
I was 20 minutes late for my reservation and they still found a seat for us
The meal was great but I didn't have time for dessert, the manager told me to go to the show and return for my coffee and desert which is included in the $22 pri-fix (Thats service!) I recomend this restaurant to everyone the food is great and you can't beat the price
Glad we took a chance on this resturant after mixed reviews
It is convienantly located on resturant row, which is nearby to many broadway theatres
Even with the wait and being seated at a cramped little table, the food and service made up for these minor faults
We also planned to just order off of the regular menu v
s
the price-fix,when our waiter after taking our order, informed us that it would be a better value to do the price-fix, with what we had orederd
That was impressive, that our waiter was trying to save us money!!! As crowded as it was the service was efficent and courteous
We will go back
Our party had a reservation at 6:00
We had to wait ten minutes to be seated but it was well worth it
We are a picky group of eaters and all of us left extremely happy
The lobster was very fresh
The veal tender and tasty
The prix fixe was very reasonably priced
We will return soon, thank you
What a perfect night! Da Rosina's food is fresh and tasty

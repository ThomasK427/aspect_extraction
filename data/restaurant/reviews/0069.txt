Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC
They also have Korean BBQ and very beer-friendly Korean appetizer(like KimChee)
It's very authentic and one of my favorite places
I have no idea what the one person who didn't like the place has against Yokocho
My wife is Japanese, as are lots of our friends, and we go there regularly
The food is very good (its not iron chef level, but still great), and the prices are pretty nice
Don't expect to be filled up by one small dish, you should order a few, or a combination, if you are eating dinner
The wait staff is very attentive; though if the place is really packed, then you may have to flag someone
This place isn't for elegant dining or a first date place (unless youre in college)
It's where you go to eat some good food and have a good drink
There is an elegant bar in the front, (however only groups of 4 can go in)
I love it
same atmosphere but food was better before years ago- octopus was like chewing a rubber tire- dumplings tasted artificial
As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get
The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese
This place is worth an one-hour drive
I am so coming back here again, as much as I can
This place is open til 3am, so I like to go after going out for drinks when you get the munchies
True, the service is hardly on par with the finer restaurants in NYC, but I go for the energy and the tasty tapas-like seafood treats that are perfect with beer or sake
The little fried sardines and spicy tuna over rice are a couple of favorites
Consistently good Japanese Tapas
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St
Marks and 1st Ave
Always good drinks and service is pretty good; Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks
Yakitori (bbq meats) is tasty too
It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar
another japanese restaurant chef is MEXICAN
whats up with this? suck food and suck service and a lot of money
I've never eaten scorched Yakitori with only burnt taste, also they don't know anything about real Yakitori
All Yakitori put on souce! Look like chef and all worker don't know anything about Japanese food!! If you are expert of Japanse food, this restaurant will make you so disappointed!!
i really love the different selections of tapas style dishes, so that you can try a lot of different dishes with friends
very fun atmosphere too, very japan like
service could be better, sometimes they mess up the order
As someone with menu A
D
D, who can't decide on a single dish, the tapas menu allowed me to express my true culinary self
My friends and I tried practically every strange, inventive dish on the menu, most of which are very tasty
The cooked sardine with cod row, fried calamari and kimchee pork were yummy standouts
Additionally the salty seafood tapas treats go wonderfully with the Kirin on tap
I have yet to even look at the entree part of the menu
but I will
I actually came here for tea
They HAVE a tea menu but were out of the three most popular blends and DID NOT have honey
i jokingly sugggested they go to the grocery store and buy some, but the waitress laughed
How are you calling yourself a morrocan and tea restaurant and be sold OUT of your most popular teas? Plus, they didn't have mint tea which is like WATER in Morroco
NOR did they have Indian chai
Although the mediterreanian plate was delicious, it was NOT what I'd expect from a tea salon
We ordered a sugar cookie and biscotti to sweeten the palate
As the sun set, the back room turned into a club
It seemed like a YOUNG/HIGH SCHOOL aged crowd waits for that hour to sneak inside
I was COMPLETELY disappointed and see it as just another overrated hip spot in Manhattan
Don't bother going if you feel like spontaneously having proper afternoon tea
Apparently, you have to make a reservation for high tea, so that they can prepare for it
Actually, upon being seated in the tea room, we weren't even offered the tea menus and had to ask for it
We actually had to ask for a lot of things: silverware, napkins, butter
The waitress was more interested in talking on her cell phone and rummaging through her backpack than she was serving us
There are plenty of better tea rooms in the city than this one
In Short Casually elegant fittings and amber tones clash with the wall-sized, sports-fixated TV screen facing the bar, while DJs drown out the buppie/hip-hop clientele
The menu offers multiple variations on chicken and seafood, as well as Grandma Jessie's sweet barbecue wings
Diners often order a variety of snacks from the appetizer menu, settle back with a cold brew and watch the game (and the people)
July 26 from B-more
Had dinner at Justin's after seeing the Color Purple
The food was very good
Thumbs up! We waited 3 hours for our entire group to eat
I don't think that was fair b/c our menu was already made up and paid for
If they couldn't handle a large group they shouldn't have taken our money
PDiddy need a new staff you would have thought it was a bunch of old people cooking the food and waiting on us
I was with a bus group on July 26th that came to Justin
We were recommended by another resturant in NYC
We preorder our food before we got to the resturant
the food was suppose to be ready but it wasnt
They kept serving drinks to us and not telling us anyting about what's going
They final serve us some corn muffins which was cold
They serve that to hold us over until the was ready
Once the food was ready, they were calling our names like a cafeteria line
it was a hot mess
it was the worst service I have ever had
The manager hid the whole time we were there
They got our money so it didnt matter how they treated us
As long as they got their money, that's all that matter
The employees in Justin's dont knw how to people please their guest that visit their establishment
I dont recommend this place at all
We had elderly people in this group and some of them were diabetes
They didnt even take that into account
Justin's manager said they could acommendate 2 buses but they handle it the pressure of a large group
The sevice was horrible and that's the bottom line
Next time we r in NYC, i will go to a Chiense Resturant first before I come back here to get a so called sourhtern meal
The resturant was only suppose to hold 96 people and we were a agroup of 114 people which is a fire hazzard
I went to Justins Restaurant on June 28 for my birthday with 5 of my friends
I had a good time however I wish they would sing happy birthday, Our waitress was very beautiful and very sweet
She told us that we could sing among ourselves if we wanted to and brought out my red velvet with candles for me
Very nice!! The food was good but took long and the drinks she recommended to us were too strong
Just so you know there is a 18% gratuity on the check!!
They charge for each cup of coffee
They have a happy hour from 5-7 everyday but we took the drinks from the bar to our table when we were ready to eat and they charged us the full price saying it was only happy hour at the bar??? we requested they give us happy hour prices since we didnt know that and they only did it for two of the three drinks (so we didnt have more or else we would have) since the third drink was ordered at the bar but delivered by the waiter once we sat down
CHEESY!!! it was over priced and the fried chicken was dry!!! the waiter was nice but like a guy from the street
not as distinguished as the place appears
i give it a 5

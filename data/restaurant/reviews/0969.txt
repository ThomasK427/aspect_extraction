shall return soon and will be a constant customer
Very cozy village sandwich shop
Discovered it while walking past a couple of days ago
very friendly staff excellent food
Have reccomended them to open an east village location
Great environment for a fast food place
feels very upscale, and food is new and interesting
Could use more menu variety, but it's a good start!
Ordered a lamb curry sandwich that came with a side salad
There were literally 5 bites of meat and 4 leaves in my salad! For the $6 it cost I could have eaten three falafels and a soda from Mamoun's around the corner
Tasted nice I admit, but the portions are an insult
Not many places in Manhattan can give you an excellent meal for less or around $5
The parathas are excellent, especially the lamb
Really HUGE!
The naanini's were new to me, but one bite and I was hooked
Been back 3 times and I told my friends about this place too
For students and those daring to explore nuevo indian food , you'll cherish this place!! Keep it up!
Great place, great decore and above all great food
The best place to go to either hang out with friends or with family
Food at the IBC makes one feel like as if one is back in INDIA
Nice way to get INDIA into NEW YORK
The Scene  This old-school pizza joint, an oasis of warmth just around the corner from Atlantic Avenue's industrial chill, is owned by Brooklyn restaurant wunderkind Jim Marmary
It's packed to the rafters with vintage soft-drink signs, faded photographs and a collection of lamps made from old tin cans
Red-and-white checkerboard tablecloths deliver the final worn-in touch
The Food  Start with the rice balls, a dense concoction of peas, pancetta and stewed tomatoes
Then order a few of the signature pizzas
Fresh toppings and basil-kissed sauce hold court on a medium-thick, flavorful crust, but stick with simpler pies, as some of the more interesting toppings, such as white-truffle oil, can easily overwhelm all other flavors
And only really serious garlic lovers should dare order the baked cheese ravioli: They don't make a breath mint strong enough to counter its aftertaste
I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week
IT WAS HORRIBLE
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted! It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst
No, really
I have eaten a lot of pizza here
La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best
Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor
The pizza was really good
Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy
So, a little inconsistency there but either way, both pizzas were really good
And affordable
A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots
Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers
Leave the kids at home! (La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico)
La Rosa Son has really good thin-crust pizza
not too much cheese, nice sauce
at a great price, in a cozy spot with no attitude
Another welcome addition to the neighborhood
The Scene Calming earth tones and an absence of decoration--with the exception of live bamboo posts in a shallow pool behind the sushi bar--put the focus on Chef Masa Takayama and his expert team of cooks
There's a quiet, humble reverence in their work; it is anything but showy, yet exhilarating to watch
Servers blend seamlessly into the background, keeping tiny sake cups full and replacing dishes without intruding
Diners are pampered but not fussed over
The Food Takayama accepts nothing short of the highest quality seafood
Cool uni floats in the mouth and melts onto the tongue
Can that mild, buttery white fish actually be mackerel? From the velvety toro tartare topped with an obscene amount of caviar, to the buttery foie gras and lobster shabu shabu, then finally to bite after bite of perfectly proportioned sushi, every piece of fish is the best of its kind
My fianc, myself, and a couple of our friends were doing this thing that we do every once in a while where we try to make it from Friday to Wednesday drunk
Luckily, James planned ahead for once and booked Masa for Saturday without telling us
A brillant move
By then, we were 24 hours in and hungry
Needless to say, I dont remember much of the evening, but I think the food was excellent
The sake was a bigger draw than the food and let me say the one thing I do remember is Cakonkou or Kakonnku or something
I kept saying Cakonku and it kept flowing
We were loud, but no one seemed to mind; certianly not this temple everyone was telling me about
It all came to $3500 or something, and my dad was pissed when he saw the AMEX, but it was worth every penny
I had made a reservation there earlier this month for a special occasion only to find out last minute that there was a logistical error with our reservation
Now, I can understand that this happens once in a while
What I cannot is how a restaurant of this small volume and presumed caliber screws up then informs the customer late
There was little effort made as a courtesy due to the inconvenience
The best restaurants go out of their way to re-accommodate
A comparable restaurant offered meal on the house recently for a similar situation
Granted, I don't expect that as the norm, I expect a restaurant that claims to put its customers first to demonstrate respect and at least offer courtesy, say a beverage or priority rescheduling for the inconvenience especially since they ask us to pay $100 if we screw up
Well done for alienating a potential customer
The Masa experience is amazing
The tasting menu never ends
The food is divine
It is without a doubt the best sushi I have ever had the pleasure of tasting
They only seat 30 people at most for 1 seating per night, which takes about 3 hours
It is a very humbling, individual experience where the sushi clearly takes the spotlight
A very serene experience and worth it once
However, even for the best sushi, a meal that is $500 a person with drinks, tips, and tax is just way too expensive
This is about 200$ too much
But I guess they have to cover there overhead, with only 1 seating per night
I have been here twice and I think the place is extraordinary
The staff is very attentive, the food is exceptional
It is a very expensive meal yet you really get what you deserve, which is the staff's attentiveness, the detail to the meal, the freshness of the seafood
I think it is truly an experience if you can afford it
Eating here as a once in a lifetime experience-- you don't do it b/c you are concerned about value
If you are concerned about value, then this is NOT the place to go
Of course you can get good sushi elsewhere, but only at Masa's does the experience transport one to a different time place for the evening
There were no empty tables when I was there (end of May on a Saturday night)
I loved the beautiful, tranquil environment
Incredible is only a subtle difference from excellent, and Masa's is within the realm of incredible
I'm grateful I had the chance to try this place out
I wish I could dine here every quarter so that I could continue to further refine my palate
However, I must sate my Masa's craving with BarMasa instead
Thank you, to the person who took me here, for a wonderful 34th birthday
Whenever restaurant reviewers claim that an expensive restaurant is worth the price, you can almost guarantee that it'll be disappointing
Let's face it, sushi is mostly raw fish and though there are 10,000 ways to prepare and serve it, simpler is often better
Unless you go to Masa where simpler costs you big bucks
The atmosphere is non-existent, the service is annoying, and the sushi is ok, but nothing special
Add the fact that it costs 3-5 TIMES as much as a reasonable sushi meal should cost and it's just a train wreck of an evening

I would not recommend this place to anyone! The staff is rude and obnoxious, including the nasty manager and event planner
We planned a party here and we were told that our guests were to be given a bracelet to identify them as taking part of an open bar
They were never given bracelets at the door and the event planner told us to round up our guests an hour into the open bar and tell them to pay the fee to get a bracelet for the remainder of the time and they still wanted to charge us for the open bar!! The bouncers were incredibly rude, barking at guests who were confused by the restrooms-there are no signs for ladies or men and if you are standing at the wrong one, beware of the loud obnoxious bouncer who will yell at you to get away from the door
I recently attended a wedding reception held in a private area downstairs at this beautiful venue and loved the experience so much I then held my own birthday party at Ludo
Each time I was very happy with the way the parties turned out - the food spreads were great, the service on the floor and at the bar was great, everyone was pleasant
Neither I, nor any of my guests had a problem with the staff inside or out
Sometimes I think what people put out is what they get back (i
e
some of the grumpier reviewers)
Ludo is a warm, welcoming place with a very attractive crowd, great music and great food
I highly recommend it!!
After reading all the past reviews and seeing the same EXACT problems I've encountered at Ludo, it is obvious that the owner / management to do not respect or appreciate their customers and their business
I recently hosted a birthday party there and the overall experience at Ludo was horrible
The bouncers, the promoters, the manager, and the event planner were all incompetent, rude, and lacked customer service skills
None of our agreed service terms were met and when confronted, there were no attempts on their end to resolve our concerns
it was very frustrating and unecessary
They had a party of 30 that will NEVER go there again or recommend to anyone else
Waited 40 min in the freezing bar to be seated
When I closed my tab, the bartender told me abt the $40 min- why not tell me that before we ordered? When the host walked (ran) us to our table, HUGE bouncer almost knocked over my date and demanded to know where he was going
I said we were following the host; he just glared said the room was private
So we had to wait till the host came back to find us! Waited 30 min for a brick they call bread and water, another hour for food (tiiiiiiiny portions)
I got pita for the gross middle eastern salad AFTER I ate it
Worst part- music was so loud that I had to yell to be heard; I gave up and ate in silence
I asked the server to turn it down 20 min later he turned it UP
I've been to Ludo twice and have had nothing but positive experiences
Most recently, I was there for a friend's birthday party, and I had great service from all the staff, from the barbacks to the manager
The manager bought my friend and I a drink, which was delicious, and one of the bartenders helped me find my coat check ticket at the end of the night
The music was great and without pretention, the DJ was gorgeous, and the place was generally filled with beautiful, friendly people
The bar scene is full of energy, and it's a great place to meet people
I would go back any day
What everyone else said about the bouncers and the staff is true
They act like they don't want your business
I only went for a friend's birthday party and I know I'll refuse to go back even if someone else has a party there
A friend and I were kept outside while the place was nowhere near full when we were the only ones waiting on the night it snowed 2 feet
I went there for V-Day, it was a fabulous experience
One of the most romantic resturants in NYC
The service was great even for V-day
I felt the food was really good, but not really that filling
Like if you ate an entree you definetly have to have a couple of appetizers because of the size of the plates
Outside of that I would rate the experience a 9
8 out of 10
Oh and if your taking someone there for a'special' moment, I recommend getting there early and selecting the table between the bar and the dining room
This is one of those places that is a great all around place
Sorry to knock the other people who complained about the doorman, pricey drinks, or lack of a dance floor
Ludo was obviously a bar/louge/restuarant
so for what it is, I think it was an amazing place
Obviously the place wasn't meant for heavy dancing like some other bar lounges, but that is to be expected
Drinks were well made and food was AWESOME! The prices were very good for what you are getting in NYC
I had no problems with the doorman or service
but just like any other place in NYC i'm sure there are good and bad nights and it's all relative
I personally was indifferent to the doorman, but thought the service was good
Great date place
This venue came highly recommended from a friend of mine
However, I must disagree
First, the doorman and the door policy was completely ridiculous
As host of the party with a full guestlisted group, I still had to wait online for 20 minutes before anyone from the staff would even look in my direction
Once inside the staff did not have anything set up for my arriving guests
Spoke to the promoter about the shortcomings
Let's just say my conversation fell on deaf ears
With the table situation settled, the night took a good set
Myself and my guests had a good time
However, those still outside waiting online would not agree
To the staff of Ludo, I have a few wise words
Money is difficult to come by
Treat your customers like gold and they will return many times over
As for my experience, I will never return or recommend
Went for a friend's birthday, were on the guest list but were ignored by the rude bouncer, waited outside for a long time in the cold were told that we couldnt get in because our friend whose name we were under was not there with us she was parking the car! were asked to step off the line!! Went back with my friend and we were treated horribly! I had to use the restroom was told there were not more than 2 people allowed in at a time
my friend was told that she wasnt allowed to wait with me on line for the bathroom! They only had 2 bathroom stalls in the whole place!!!! The music sucked and there was no dance floor!!! The people there were a crowd of weirdos too
but I won't even get into that
This place sucked, I wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy!!
I went to Ludo with a large group of friends
We were promptly seated
The food was pretty good, but due to our large size (~16) the manager asked us to limit our appetizers to just 3 selections b/c he didn't want to overburden his cooks
In my honest opinion, that's pretty pathetic
One's restaurant should always be prepared to be busy - isn't that what you want? I don't quite know what that says about the restaurant and staff's abilites
In any case, the food was quite yummy and on monday nights, they have a prix fixe $25 dinner which is definitely a deal
The decor was modern and chic
After dinner, the place turns into a bar/lounge with a DJ
It wasn't particularly busy that Saturday night
The staff was accomodating as we continued to linger for a few more hours
All in all, I would go back
Wow! I was extremely impressed! I threw my bf a birthday dinner party there and boy was I blown away - the service, price, ambiance, food, everything had exceeded my expectations
What impressed me the most was their level of service - A+++! Even though the service charge was built-in given the size of our group - the staff still went above and beyond what was expected
The decor was amazing! The appetizers/entree were yummy! The shocking thing was - you won't break your wallet coming here
My friends complimented on what a great choice I made
If you are looking for a place to hold a birthday dinner party, look no further
Ludo is the choice to go
Thanks Mike Kenny for making this experience so enjoyful
You guys are awesome
A buddy and myself showed up alone and were very friendly and honest with the doorman and his female manager
We told them we had some friends inside and just wanted to have a beer or two with them, no big deal
They let us in right away and we had a great time
I have never had a bad time there and think that it is one of the best bars in NY
Looking forward to New Years there!
This club seemed to be tucked away between apartments somewhere in the East Village, which made me wonder about any particular noise violations that it might rack up
After wandering down the stairs I realized the place was practically underground but playing some of the most interesting raggaeton, hip hop, and latin hits blended well together
The club was dark, only light coming from candles situated all around the bar and in various rooms
The service is interesting, the bouncers were quite friendly to me which seemed surprisingly given the reviews I've read on this site
The drinks were really poorly made and were weak
Thankfully the price justified it, but I don't think I'll bother to order another

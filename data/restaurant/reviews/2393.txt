Despite the attentive service, there was a feeling of being rushed through the meal
The courses weren't well paced
The pasta specials were awesome
The famed wedding pillows were overpowered by the citrus peel
The pasta and fish were very good
The 'tea for two' dessert was delicious and fun! Definately worth a try or two
I went here with my wife for our wedding anniversary expecting good things
At first everything looks great
The wait staff is courteous, the rooms are intimate and the menu looked great
After we ordered my opinion changed
A bacala and string bean salad was flavorless and far too big to be an appetizer
It did have the distinction of reeking like bad fish though
My sweetbreads, described as crispy by the waiter, were good but nothing special - and not crispy
Finally, the lemon verbena panna cotta was glue-like and seemed to be missing the lemon verbena
My wife's pasta dish was excellent and wine by the glass was good
In the end, the $160 price tag simply was not worth it
I'm a big fan of Lidia's, but in my mind, I didn't feel this restaurant really represented her cooking very well
The service was impeccable, the appetizers were delicious (mushroom polenta
to die for)
But the entrees we ordered were very bland
I had to add salt and red pepper flakes before I could even taste my broccoli rabe pasta dish
My dinner guest had to add salt to his sea bass
For my tastes, I think her Becco restaurant would be much better
I have eaten at Felidia a few times, and have always found the menu to be interesting, the food excellent, and the service to be quite good
If you are obviously into conversation, the server will leave you alone
However, you won't be ignored if you need service
The location isn't terrific, but that's a small criticism for a great restaurant
Reservations can be made up to a month in advance
Reservations are a must, but don't be surprised about not getting an excellent table at the last minute
Frankly, I'm surprised at some of the bad reviews for Felidia
I urge you to take them with a grain of salt
I'm generally pretty tolerable about where I'm seated, but this place upset even me
There seem to be open tables (probably in the nicer upstairs in fact); however, they sat us in the corner of the lower level next to where the waiters hangout and warm each pasta dish on a hot plate that comes from the kitchen to the dining room
Their chatter showed they were not as caring abou the restaurant as they wanted you to think they were
And the head waiter was rude
I had one great dish--pecorino and pear ravioli
My girlfriends pasta (lobster tomato sauce) was awful
The sauce was just oil with a minute amount of diced lobster and virtually no tomatos
Bread had potentitial, but was somewhat stale and everything else was medicore except the price was high
Too expensive, food ok but waiters bus boys always at your table, no privacy
We had a Tuscan wine pairing dinner here and were floored
The wine was terrific, the food delicious and the service attentive yet fun
If you have been to Babbo's think; less stuffy waitstaff with the same lovely ambiance and non-dairy pastas
Best Restaurant when not on a budget
The new sommelier chose well matched wines for each dish with histories and explanations of each bottle
Highly recommeded and I will definitely be returning
I find some of the previous ratings to be snobby and somewhat silly
First, if you couldn't find anything to eat on Felidia's menu, you probably should not be dining at gourmet restaurants in NYC
Stick to Olive Garden
The food at Felidia was imaginative, fun, and full of fresh, bright flavors
My mother and I had exceptional seafood dishes, fabulous homemade breads, and decadent desserts
We even got to see and talk to Lidia on our way out - all in all, an absolute treat and a half!!!
We were disappointed with the menu selections and the service
The menu is very limited and my wife had trouble finding something that she wanted to eat
The food is prepared well and it is delicious
Service was another matter
Maybe because we were there on a Monday
Our water glasses were empty and we had to ask for more wine, bread butter
The bread came without butter we waited unusually long for it to be served
I'd say Lydia needs to re-work the staff selections
My group and I being true NY foodies were looking forward to this meal for some time
How disappointed we were
Had 8:30 reservations and had called ahead because we were going to be
10 minutes late due to traffic
Got to the resturant at 8:40 and was seated at 9:50! Had totally lost my appetite but was looking forward to a great meal (based on the TV program)
Too bad Lidia doesn't cook
Has the executive chief ever heard of salt? Food was in one word BLAAA
get it, forget it
Good for out of towners who don't know any better
Food is absolutely delicious - after all these years
What was disappointing was our head waiter
He barely even acknowledged that we were there
We had much better service from the bread waiter
With all the other finer Italian Restaurants around, maybe Felidia's should improve in this area
Very disappointing for the price you pay - service is part of the experience
We made reservations through our concierge (at her recommendation) and were told that this place was fabulous
WRONG! Snobby staff and horrible seating (we were seated at a tiny table next to the main walk-through and were bumped by staff each time they walked by) was the first thing we noticed
Portions were VERY small-I lived in Italy, and trust me- they don't eat like birds there!!! We won't be back to this restaurant
Although I live in Virginia every time I come to visit I always make it a priority to stop in for dinner at least once
The food is always innovative and well prepared, the service helpful and professional
Well worth the price!! The tiramisu is to die for!!
My husband and I were seated at a table in the bar which was shoved up against a wall that smelled like a dirty washcloth (I think they lost our reservation since it did not seem like a table should be there and it took a while to be seated)
The menu did not support her cookbooks or PBS series, which is what we were expecting
The Captain was showing his impatience for a crowded Monday night and the dinner I was served was not prepared the way he told me it would be
They also did not have any dry red wines by the glass (not everyone can drink a bottle of wine) Overall, the smell of the place was enough to make us lose our appetites so we asked for the check and left
Biggest waste of money we have spent this year!
Felidia was everything we expected
The food was sophisticated, yet genuine
The service impeccable, yet subtle and the ambience elegant, yet comfortable
There is just the perfect wait the lively bar, as any bar in a good NYC restaurant should be
Enough time for a leisurely drink and then on to a feast, that left us satisfied - body and soul
I remembered liking this place so much 2 years ago and was rather disappointed by a recent visit
Yes, the service is still gracious and the cheesesticks are good
The pasta, though, wasn't even close to the stuff I make at home in terms of harmony, flavor and originality
My tagliatelle was too tough to complement the stewed veal
Instead of being able to have all the flavors blend and melt in my mouth, the pasta stood out and didn't pick up the flavor of its sauce in the least
Ah well
I suspect they might have changed the chef
Last night my husband and I celebrated making the last payment of our mortgage at Felidia
I am obsessed with stuffed zucchini flowers- and they had the best I've ever eaten

It's obvious they use very high quality ingredients, and it makes a difference
I ordered a small - half plain, half roasted peppers and olives
Pizza came out fast (10 minutes), but at the time few people were there
The crust was dark and well-done, but soft, not like a cracker
On the half with the topping, the bottom was a little soggy in places
They pile the toppings on high
The edges of the crust are very thick - the one thing I didn't like about it
Otherwise an excellent pizza
Prices are slightly high (I also had one glass of wine, bill came to just over $20), but I'm not complaining
Overall excellent experience
The BEST (and first) NY pizza in the USA! Well balanced, excellent crust, sauce was outstanding and the mozarella cheese was AMAZING! (Although my young son did have problems keeping the cheese on the pizza) Everything we heard about Lombardi's was true, IT ROCKED!
Ate at Lombardis on recommendation from citysearch
I just got back to my hotel and felt i had to write about it
It is probably the best pizza i have ever eaten
The toppings are like skyscrapers
We had a large with meatballs, pepperoni, mushrooms, red onions and beefsteak tomatoes
It was amazing
We ate ourselves sick, and with a glass of wine and a bottle of san Pellegrino, the bill came to only $34
If you love pizza, EAT THERE!
I saw this place on cable television on one of these America Eats documentaries and wanted to compare my favorite pizza to this landmark
I was in N
Y
a few months ago and took my brother, who lives in Manhattan
We both enjoyed the pizza so much that he has been back with his family twice in the last month
It is really great pizza, served by very nice people
I would say that it is among the best pizzas I have eaten
OK, if you are looking for the best typical NY Slice type of pie, this is NOT it
This is coal-oven pizza with fresh cheese
And that is what they do best
But many of the disappointed reviews here seem to be looking for the Ray's kind of slice
Different animal
Lombardi's is good, but in my opinion it doesn't come close to Grimaldi's
Lombardi's delivers to my neighborhood, but I have sadly learned that coal-oven pizza does not travel well
You have to eat it hot and fresh
Service is kind of curt, but not terrible
I discovered this place because of a tv program on Food Network, Follow That Pizza with Gordon Elliott
I ordered the basic pizza - tomato sauce, mozerella and basil
It is a STUNNINGLY good pizza, the absolute finest I've had in my life, no joke
All 8 of my friends agreed it was the best pizza they had ever had
We went back and ordered 2 different pies with various toppings, and again was amazed at how good this pizza is
A classic hole in the wall, with decent service and very good prices, I can't imagine that a person could ever find a better pizza pie on this planet, or any other
I can see why people go out of their way to enjoy Lombardi's, I certainly will whenever possible for the rest of my days
incredible
I used to consider John's Pizzeria the best pizza to be found in NYC, but after sampling the amazingly orgasmic pizza at Lombardi's, my opinion was promptly changed
The crust is delicious, the sauce is robust, and the toppings are out of this world (the pepperoni is my favorite)
Don't waste your time in any other NYC pizza places
head straight to Lombardi's
I consider myself a pizza connoisseur
There is nothing better to me than a great slice of pizza
I went to Lombardi's with high expectations and excitement and was pretty let down
I would say the pizza is good, but definitely not great
To me, Joe's on Carmine/Bleecker is far superior, and the closest thing I have ever had to the, perfect slice
Try it if you are curious, but if you are a pizza snob, be prepared to be disapppointed
I even drank a few beers to see if intoxication would improve my opinion
needless to say, it didn't help
Lastly, you are forced to purchase a pie
they do not offer slices
To me, that's not fair
as a native nyker, i think Lombardi's fair as one of the tops in the city
however, i do believe they can substantially improve
Yes, i've been there a few occasions and the pizza arrive partially burnt each time and i think that can be overlooked if they just add a bit more of the toppings
Don't know whether the chef is in a rush and not spread enough or thats the norm for their pie
overall, its good but not great
Try Ray's on Prince
great pizza! it's a narrow shop, though, so it's hard to manuver when it's crowded
I've been going to Lombardi's for years n years and in the past couple the drop off has been profound
Crust like cardboard (guys, the brick oven thing is great but set the timer fergod'ssake!!), tasteless mozz
and sauce that 's been sitting in a jar somewhere for too long! overpriced toppings as well
i'M OUT
Do yerself a favor and schlep up to Stromboli on St Marks and 1st ave
They do slices too!! For the el supremo however it's over to Brooklyn @ Dattilios on Old Fulton
Lombardi's? FUGGHEDABOUTIT!
this place hands down has the best pizza in new york
trust me i've been to dozens of pizza places in the 5 boroughs
people who complain about the burn crust don't understand what a coal burning oven is
that's the beauty of the pizza
it has this wonderful burnt sooty taste that contrasts the sweet pizza sauce
yummy in my tummy
go go enjoy!
I love the reviewer who said that Lombardi's is not real NY pizza
I guess he doesn't know this is the first pizza place in the USA!!! All the oldest and best NY places were started by ex-Lombardi's employees or cousins, etc
Another clue guys: Pizza is SUPPOSED to be slightly burnt, not the Domino's your used to! Having said that though, the pizza is not that great
Because of it's history, Lombardi's must be compared to the very best places and unfortunately, it doesn't measure up
The best pizza's in the USA are Patsy's on 117th 1st and Johnny's in Mt
Vernon, NY
Grimaldi's, John's Lombardi are not even close to these
Lombardi's has a great coal oven, but the crust is too thick and their yeast culture is just not the right flavor for me
Worth a pilgrimage just for the historical atmosphere though
Well maybe it wasn't that bad, but please what's with all the 9's and 10's? Do only tourists review on Citysearch? I guess I can understand if someone from Timbuktu, like a freshly arrived NYU college kid, who's been eating ketchup and cheese on a frozen pie, rates this place highly
The rest of us are less then impressed
This is not real NY pizza
Real NY pizza is made of delicious sauce, cheap greasy cheese (just the way I like it), and thin, moist and crisp crust
This place's pizza aspires to be gourmet not NY
Burnt crust, skimpy albeit fresh mozzarella, ok sauce and lousy service, plus a long line (god knows why), make this place a tourist trap
Go to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn for something decent
Skip John's, almost as bad
I tried this place about 5 times and each time I dont get the hype for it
Order the clam pizza if u wanna spend the rest of your night chewing your jaw fall off
IT's just too chewy! A few other times I Ordered just a few toppings and each time it came out burnt
I personally dont enjoy burnt pizza taste and I won't be going back soon

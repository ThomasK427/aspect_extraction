Bad if served in Japan
If they serve same foods in Japan, they should close the restaurant in one year
Similar but different food with Japanese
A great spot for a quick, tasty, and reasonbly priced lunch
Recommend the Ramen (noodle soup) dishes, and the curry rice dishes
Only drawback, they do not accept credit cards
I love Japanese ramen places since they're a quick and substantial way to do lunch during the work week
Sapporo definitely ranks up there for value for money, especially being in the midtown area
Great big bowls of ramen for $7, and delish gyoza (dumplings) for $3! Plus they're superfast, so you don't have to wait long when you're starving
on of the best places for value and taste
if your not shy, them dig in! ask for silverware, unless trained in chopstix!
I used to like this place (5 plus yrs ago) but am truly disappointed with it now
Overpriced food for a dive
Got a noodle dish that was all soup and no substance
Although it still has an authentic Japanese flavor (I've eaten in Japan many times), I would not go back anymore because the quality and value are just not there anymore
At least the service is alway EXTREMELY efficient (faster than Mickey D's)
One of my favourite places in Times Square
The food is always perfect and a glass of plum wine goes wonderfully! This place always cheers me up and it's well-priced with some of the fastest service!
I come to this place often, and I have to say I get my money's worth! Their Ramen Soups are awesome! You get these big bowls of soup for like $7
Dinner was delicious and the restaurant was a nice place to relax after a busy day of shopping
Lovely views looking onto the hustle and bustle of 5th Avenue
Food and service were both great, contrary to the previous review
I had the pan roasted halibut which was perfectly prepared
Dessert is amazing - we shared the chocolate malted baked alaska!
I came to fives with some family and was completely underwhelmed
I do have to say the restaurant itself was very nice, but unfortunately the food and service was below average
I ordered the beef medallions
The cut of the meat was a very low quality and it was pretty tasteless
I was surprised that a restaurant like this would serve such a low grade
My wife had the cod which was fair at best
The service was not much better; the waiter was pretty absent and never really came back after the meal was served
Its too bad, as the restaurant does have potential
I went with a party of four during Restaurant Week
Every table was occupied, but the restaurant remained quiet, with tables situated almost 10-15 feet apart
A very nice contrast to the places that pack you in like sardines
The fois gras was delicious, and the tenderloin was cooked perfectly
Service was ever-present without being overbearing
Great service
Delicious food
Excellent presentation
My wife's favorite was the dessert
We will be back
I went there and had a pretty good meal, although it was a little overpriced for the size of the portions
Especially when a cup of coffee was $6
But I really enjoyed the ambiance and the service was pretty good and we were seated promptly
Would return again
As soon as I saw the overwhelming portions of food around me I knew that I would be better off sharing a plate with my mom
Wait
theres a sharing charge!! I ate a mesclun salad with oil and balsamic vinager
The prices took away my hunger
The salad looked like some one emptied an entire bag of one of those pre packaged salads on a plate
It was really good and I was not able to finish it so I asked for a box to take it with me and I shared it with my mom in our hotel room
Haha!! My mom had a cheesecake with fresh strawberries which was good, but it didnt have many strawberies, just a layer of thinly sliced strawberries with jam in between the slivers
I don't get this place - they charge you 16$ for a sandwhich that you can't eat
I guess that is their gimmick, but in my opinion it is stupid
The sandwiches are so large that you it is just a waste, and the price is astronomical even for Times Square
Oh yeah, and the quality is nothing special either
My Turkey was average, and my bread was stale
My wife and I always eat our first meal here when visiting NYC
it's right across the street from the TKTS booth, so we might as well
Good food and large portions
There's a fee to split a sandwich, but if you get a side order (like fries), they waive it
And believe me, two can easily share a sandwich
Wonderful baked goods, also
And the service is friendly and above average
Sure, the portions are huge, but who can really eat over a pound of meat slapped between two tiny pieces of Wonder Bread? And you're paying for the portions all right - All sandwiches are around $15 to $20
The potato pancakes are good (just like mom used to make), and the food is fresh, but you're better off going somewhere else for the price
This is also a tiny place, so don't expect to be able to dine with a large group
I sure couldnt eat all tey gave me
It wasn't cheap, but what is in NYC? Decent service, kind of a fun atmosphere
I must admit, the customer service leaves a lot to be desired but, the cheesecake is out of this world!! Smooth as silk! I'm originally from NYC, moved down here to Atlanta, GA and I haven't eaten better cheesecake
When I went to visit NYC, I bought a whole strawberry cheesecake and brought it home
My boyfriend and I ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner
LOL!!
I ORDERED THE PASTRAMI ON RYE
IT WAS GOOD, BUT WHO CAN EAT THAT MUCH, EXPECIALLY WHEN VISITING AND STAYING IN A HOTEL
I WOULD GLADLY HAVE HAD 1/2 OF THE SERVING AND PAID LESS
DAUGHTER ORDERED THE SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS
THE NOODLES WERE QUITE NAKED; SHE ASKED FOR MORE SAUCE AND WAS ACCOMMODATED
THE THREE LARGE MEATBALLS WERE TASTY
UNFORTUNATELY, WE WASTED 3/4 OF OUR MEAL
IT WAS OUR FAULT, HAD WE BEEN STAYING IN A HOTEL WITH A FRIDGE, WE COULD HAVE TAKEN IT 'TO GO'
I WOULDN'T GO AGAIN, UNLESS I SPLIT AN ORDER
$45 COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT
Stopped in on a busy Saturday night
Portions are large, but you pay for them
They were not real excited to deal with kids
Too bad, because there were a lot of families out that night
Too much food but not necessarily good
They charge you for sharing the humangous plates that not a normal person can eat by itself
The only thing nice about it was the funny caricatures on the wall and the cheesecake
Great place, great food, great service and abundant amount of food with reasonable price
Went here for breakfast recently and had what may have been the worst meal of my life
Don't go anywhere near this hole!
You cannot get anything for under $15
A can of warm soda costs $2
25
The sandwiches are so large that one cannot eat them alone, yet the sharing charge is $3
00, which brings up the cost of any sandwich to at least $20, and it's just not worth it
The Scene The long, wood-paneled room is minimally decorated

The price was very appropriate and overall we had a great time
If this isn't the best deal in the Village- if not the city, I don't know what is- the dinner and lunch specials are great (three courses for under 7 and under 15 respectively) and the brunch deal is over the top- great food- enhanced by unlimited mimosas! And I mean unlimited- they make it a point to keep your glass full
Service is always great
The Italian cuisine is not gourmet but the great location, indoor atmosphere and outdoor sidewalk seating make this place a sure thing
The lunch special is a good deal, and usually served fairly quickly
It includes soup or salad, choice of a good selection of entrees, and coffee or tea
However, should you want iced tea rather than hot tea, they will charge you extra
Apparently their ice supplier is very expensive
The pastas are very good, however, and the ambience is nice, though it can get noisy
In Short Pop open the door on this cozy downtown trattoria and you're hit with a warm blast of garlic
Diners lounge around the casual space, catching up on the newspaper, and diving into bowls of fusilli with stewed tomatoes, olives and capers, and penne with spinach and ricotta
In summer, tables are set out on the Greenwich Street sidewalk
Service is swift and friendly
Sapore is not TOP NOTCH, however, if I'm in the neighborhood, I'm stopping by everytime
Seafood dishes are great, Italian cuisine is average
Claustrophobic individuals may want to consider outdoor seating as the inside is a bit cozy
Lunch specials are the real strong point of Sapore
Service is usually great, every now and then you get the unmotivated waiter
My friend kept telling me it was good and that we 'had to go' because he used to eat there everyday for lunch
i didnt believe
We went
it rocked
I had the penne ala vodka w/ chicken, soooooo good and it was like 10 bucks for this huge bowl
Going again tonight with a friend, then taking a date there tomorrow :-)
This place was terrible:Drink with tomato sauce on the outside of the glass, ceasar salad, the Romaine lettuce was wilted and brown, the dressing sparse and watered down and there was half a slice of a red onion
They obviously didn't bother to clean out the salad spinner before making mine
I ordered the 4 cheese pasta and received a bowl of Fusil pasta with only parma cheese that was so thick it looked like Elmers glue, great for art class, but not to eat
When I asked if they had wine by the glass, they said yes that they had a Chianti, when I asked which one, the guy said the italian one I just had a few bites and got the hell out
During my meal the waiter and waitress gathered with other friends that had arrived and they spent the whole time talking and ignoring the clientele
My friends and I regularly walk or train 20+ blocks to eat at this favorite find! I highly recommend the Penne ala Vodka w/ Chicken, but all the pastas and panini's are delicious
Every friend we've brought have become regulars as well, don't miss this great value and their hearty portions!
I was pleasantly surprised by this place
Not only were the entrees under $10 but they were delicious!! Great prices and great food
Great food (and I only had a panini)
The pasta I scavenged was great and the prices are unbelivable
The Brunch apparently has all you can drink memosa's
I'd go again and again
Don't miss this place! Great food, romantic spot if you stay outside, flawless service, it was probably the best cost vs benefit relation I've ever seen in NY
This little hole-in-the-wall italian joint has great pasta for cheap prices
Pasta entrees were mainly $7 to$9 but it taste better or as good as the other famous italian restaurant such as Carmines
Though the joint is small, its perfect for couples or groups under 4
Its a cute little place, perfect to sit down and have casual dinner/lunch
My wife and I travel to Manhattan from Staten Island once per weekend almost EVERY weekend for the past 4 years to dine at Sapore
The food, the ambiance, and especially the service is consistantly excellent
It has become a favorite to many who've we've introduced it to
Actually, our (mine and my husband's) favorite restaurant, PERIOD
Don't listen to the bad reviews
We have tried so many dishes there and love every single one
They have a great brunch special on weekends with the most delicious food (including homemade croissants), terrific lunch specials (with plenty for your $6), and of course the regular dinner entrees are wonderful
The appetizers, the bread
basically we love it all
The waiters are so friendly, and the size of the place makes for a cozy atmosphere
And try the tiramisu! We also prefer the original Sapore to Sapore Due
Visited NYC in July, had the BEST of the BEST time At Sapore
Order the CRABCAKES
:)
Looking for a cheap lunch can be hard
Not here though
You get so much for your money
The pasta dishes are really good
And for $6 you get salad or soup and a pasta dish
Its a cute place to eat and the waiters are really nice
Have been going there for a couple of years now and love it every time
Entrees are great and filling, appetizers could definitely use some work
Cute little restaurant
very, very small
Atmosphere was definitely nicer during the summer because of outdoor seating
Go in the summer and sit outside!
Decent, fairly priced, heavy, italian food
Nice but slow staff
Every time I've eaten here I've loved it
Excellent service, great food, great prices, best place to people-watch
Whenever I have first-time visitors to NYC come to visit me I always take them to Sapore
Just great!
Went there with a friend I have not seen in a while
We sat outside and just really wanted to chat and take out time
The waiter did not rush us at all
Wine choice is limited and I wish that they had better looking menus (they look like take out menus)
Food was good and defintely good price
Hands down my favorite little restaurant in the city
Where else can you go to get freshly made Italian food at ridiculously low prices? Although seating is tight, they always manage to fit people in
Service is quick, bread scrumptious, good sized portions
OK I will let you in on the secret they call SAPORE now that they just opened the new joint across the street (SAPORE DUE (used to be the dew drop inn)-In the past 2 years or so I have eaten pretty much everything on the menu and can honestly say I have not been disappointed yet
The menu is basic italian all prepared fresh to order , My favorite dish has to be the black linguni with shrimp, mussels and clams, as well as the stuffed squid appetizer(wich unfortunately is an unusual special)
The service is incredibly nice and efficient,the only complaint i ever had is that the original sapore was too small and this too has been remedied with Sapore Due
The Scene With locations in the West and East Village, Moustache operates on a simple philosophy: Serve savory, affordable Middle Eastern food in a cozy, urbane setting; and keep that puffed-up, fresh-out-of-the-oven pita coming to the table
Unfortunately, the wait for a table at this West Village location can be unbearably long
The Food Start off with a mix of salads like babaganouj and chick pea-spinach-and-tomato, and move on to a sandwich--sliced leg of lamb or merguez sausage wrapped in a pita
Or try a "pitza"--fresh pita dough topped with lamb, spinach and other toppings--for one
Otherwise, this place was fantastic
If you can't afford a trip to Turkey, then you should come here
Service was impeccable! A very patient waitress answered all my questions for my dietary needs
Food was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Oh God! The pita bread alone was big, fluffy and inflated! The hummus was so fresh! I highly recommend the ouzi which is rice in a pastry with chicken and herbs - oh! to die for! I will definately be coming back! Oh, BTW - you must try the middle eastern beer! yum!
great food, good service, wonderful prices for homemade food that you just have to go back again for
Sort of Greek, Turkish food with incredible pizzas and hummus
better call ahead to see if they serve more than wine and beer
no reservations can be a headache in cold weather but if you hit at a little off time you can walk right in and have a great meal for not so much money
I think they are open for lunch and till at least midnight
I really havent had mediterranean food at a restaurant since Cookies and Couscous on Thompson closed down
Let me tell you, I really enjoyed this place

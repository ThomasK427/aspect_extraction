Then we could choose any dessert from the menu
None of that you can only choose one of these 3 boring desserts because you had the prix fixe menu stuff! Each of us got an obscene chocolate dessert
YUMMY! I would definitely go back
There was no separate tip for the captain
Me and my boyfriend go to Aureole every valentines day and this past holiday was our 3rd trip to the restaurant
We were seated quick, we had the best table upstairs
It was so romantic
The maitre'd was amazing
the waiter actually remembered us from last year and told us how happy we were back, The service was by far and away outstanding
never did i want for anything
everything was replenished without me even thinking about it
I just sat back and enjoyed
I can not wait till next year for Valentines day again
The food is exceptional
Reading the negative reviews about the staff is so hurtful to me because they DO NOT think they are better than the customers
Our waiter thanked us and even shook both of our hands and told us he hoped to see us soon and that is before we left the tip
The food was very good, ambiance beautiful
Generally the staff was very attentive, but the captain was pretty arrogent
When i ordered dinner, he insisted I was making a mistake , and VERY strongly suggested I get the tuna
He wouldn't stop arguing with me! He did make it sound delicious, so I agreed
(Not surprised he was so insistant, there was $15 additional charge for the tuna) It was good, but I ordered it medium rare and it came out so rare it was cold in the middle
Same with my boyfriend's medium well steak
Plus, on the bill, they ask you to tip the waiter AND tip the captain
Here's a tip, don't bully peolple into ordering a more expensive dish
The bill for dinner for 2 people was $260
My one drink (vodka and soda) was $15
50
I'm glad I went, but I would not go back
I don't know what all these negative reviewers are about, but I go to Aureole several times a year for both lunch and dinner, and I have never had less than marvelous dining experiences
The food, service, ambience and wines are the best
The food is extremely creative and delicious
Service is always welcoming and correct
Ambience is perfect for business or personal celebrations
Wine suggestions are always perfect
Tasting dinners/lunches are great ways to sample the creative genius of the chef
After hearing so many great things about Aureole, I was very excited to try it
I must say, I was a tad disappointed
The food was good, the ambiance was nice (very quiet), the decor was pleasant, but nothing really anything special
The service was attentive, but one got the sense that the wait staff thought that they were better than the customers
The wine list was only mediocre for a restaurant of such esteem and quite overpriced
Overpriced seemed to characterize the whole meal
Everything was good, but not worth it in my mind
I refused to believe the negative reviews about this place, having heard so many great things about the restaurant
BELIEVE IT
I just went there for dinner tonight and was sorely dissappointed
I ordered the lamb trio,and the TENDERloin was extremely chewy! I told our waiter and the chef wanted to make me the EXACT SAME THING AGAIN
I told him I wanted another dish instead-I thought at a famous restaurant charging above $70/person, there would be no problem switching bad food
Well it turns out that this guy had quite an attitude (had one from the beginning, but got worse)
To the restaurant's credit, once I told one of the other waiters about the problems I was having, our waiter became much nicer and offered us comps such as dessert wine and extra dessert
p
s
- the restaurant isn't that romantic or nicely decorated
My wife and I had dinner at this restaurant on June 11th
We ordered the chief's menu which featured spring themed courses such as shrimp salads with vinegrette, monk fish with white wine vinegrette and other lighter foods
The problem was everything up to the pork was sour and salty
The pork really saved the meal, 3 different cuts of pork was served prepared with balsamic vinegar and the flavor was nice
Dessert was fabulous
We ordered the Smores dessert and it was the best I've had in NYC
incredible-- last year, my brother in law had the black truffle risotto
they piled on the black truffle and it was definitely delicious
i had the wonderfully seared foie gras
we went again a few months later (april/may 2004) and the food was solid, but not as tasty as the first time around)
nevertheless, a great menu with yummy food, although the service can be a bit stiff
The restaurant was quite understanding when I had to wait for someone an hour past my reservation time
The food was good except for the sole with crabmeat
I would recommend as a first course the oysters or the octopus salad
Veal (cheek, shoulder, sweetbreads) was excellent as an entree
I was a bit surprised to see a slot for a captain's tip on my bill since this was the first I've ever had to leave one
Am I missing something? Went to Aureole last night with high expectations, but was let down by the just-shoot-me waiters and huh? food
The chef seemed to try too hard to be unique, and the combination of ingredients seemed to overcompensate rather than balance the individual flavors
For such an expensive restaurant, I expected an experience to remember for days, rather than forget almost immediately after
Dont let your contempt for the French keep you out of this Midtown gem
I went here with a few financier colleagues for Price Fixe Fridays
The service was impeccable and we were treated like royalty, even my colleague who was dressed like a panhandler
I ate the Billy goat cheese pudding along with the chicken BREAST and topped it off with Pear dessert
The dessert was a work of art, and would probably look right at home next to a Rembrandt painting in the Met
The portions were fair and was enough to fill my above average stomach
All in all I highly recommend this eatery, but the candy at the door was subpar
For the money - its not worth it
I have been to many nice restaurants and this is not the one with the best food, atmosphere or service
Go to Daniel, spend $30 more for two people and get 5X the experience and 10X better food
The service was no better than at some random restaurant
Go if someone else is paying, since the menu changes
It might just be a poor season for them right now
I have yet to find another restaurant which meets Aureole's quality of service and excellence
The head waiter was extremely knowledgable and helpful which added depth to our culinary experience
The waitstaff were attentive and the food was wonderful
The seating is close together but that was a good thing
I enjoy the company of others who also takes pleasure in fine dining
i ate at aureole for dinner, and was surprised to find that the food was overly salty
i usually end up putting more salt on all of my food because i think it's too bland
but even the breadsticks set on each table were over salted and not able to be eaten
i ordered the skate (as mentioned in the citysearch editorial review) and it was not crispy
the inside was mush and the outside was tough and unable to be cut through with a knife
however, upon my mentioning this to our waiter, he immediately offered to replace my entree (i ordered the chicken and it was fine) and also gave us complimentary dessert and coffee
the tables are close together as other reviews mention
i think i know everything about the lives of the couple sitting at th table next to us
but the space is charming and the ambience is relaxed
The food was incredible
Every morsel was delicious from the amuse bouche to the final morsel of truffles

i had the salmon with polenta and for dessert the green tea cake with almond ice cream
the ambiance was low-key but classy
good for either a group (with reservations) or a date or for foodies that love to eat!
Last week we went to see the little boy exhibition at the Japan Society
Upon leaving we craved a meal that had equal artistic integrity
We chose CHUBO
One of the best meals I've had in a long time
Everything tasted good
Amazing foie gras, delicate striped bass, and to-die-for mango pancake with caramel sauce
I'd go back in a second
Small portions, small taste, big price
Not cheap, not good
Slow service
The food was unique, tasty and excellent
Every single part of our meal was exceptional
We were there on Tuesday night and was pretty mellow
Friendly staff
Cute little place and we both loved it
Worth the trip to LES
The food at Chubo was very good
I would highly recommend the Escargot and Sashimi starters and Mixed Grille entree
However, the service was absolutely HORRIBLE
We waited approximately 30-40 minutes between our starter and entree, and we were forced to fill up on the bread so we wouldn't starve to death, so we we not that hungry when the entrees arrived
There are only two waiters for the entire restaurant and they both serve all the tables, which made for confusion and inefficency as they both repeatedly asked whether we had ordered, what we had ordered, etc
Food was great, ambiance was good
The only concern we had was slow service
You have to wait for 10mins between each dish
If it is improved, it will be perfect
(Perhaps, it will be good to the restaurant,too!  To become more efficient and have more customers for one night
)
For an appetizer, I had soba in pho-like broth with dumplings, and I already liked the restaurant
My husband had shrimp to start and monkfish with pasta bean soup (tomoto and other interesting flavors) for entre
Trout with mushroom source and vegies cooked in paper was more French than anything else
We shared everything and enjoyed them all
The highlight for me was mango pancake with liquor ice cream----the second best dessert I ever had next to grandma's banana cream pie
We had a decent bottle of Sauvignon, and our bill was a little over 100 dollars
wow
I love Lower East Side!!! We'd definitely go back
food was a bit too salty, and several of our dishes (six people) had the same taste
oh well
this is too bad, as everyone was friendly and the space was well decorated
cozy, cute, and clean
Heard great things
Wasn't impressed
Appetizers of Shrimp and the Dumpling soup both disappointing
Monkfish, nothing but boring
However, beef with orzo was very tasty
Service was slow, but attentive
Decor, nothing special, actually nothing special about the place at all
Overall, not worth it
Would not go back
On Valentine's Day, I was treated to a meal that left my husband and I feeling taken advantage of
Our meal consisted of a 3-course prix-fix for $42
We'd been to Chubo before and knew what to expect
Our serving of oysters, while small, was well prepared
However our shrimp entree had 3 shrimp, 2 tablespoons of spinach and less than a 1/4 cup of flan
The bus person was clearly afraid of our response as she ran away as soon as it was served
I can't comment on the quality of the food as frankly, I was so shocked at the meager portions
The kicker was the desert - a 1 round of cheese cake
Apparently we weren't the only unhappy customers, we witnessed another patron asking for a salad, or SOMETHING as they were still hungry
We were supremely ripped off and will not be back
i brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and we both absolutely loved it
it is a small and cozy place and the staff is amazingly friendly and helpful
the food was an excellent fusion of flavors
highly recommend the scallops
the prix fix price was reasonable
our waitress paired the wine tasting perfectly
the only thing that was slightly disappointing was the asian pear tart, which came no frills
Just had a chance to try the Bento Brunch at Chubo
It was great but it seems they haven't advertised much for Sunday brunch- they should
Service was top rate and the meal was well proportioned and as delicious as the dinner meals I've had here
Love it here- All they need is a little hype and the place will be rocking in 2004
I got to try their Bento Brunch last Sunday, and it was fabulous
Tofu Napoleon layered with vegetable was light and tasty
Sweet Potato Hash Brown was addictive
I tried Soba as a side, and though it looked authentic Japanese, the dipping sauce has an interestingly sweet + spicy twist to it
Unlike their dinner menu, the brunch is very Japanese, but shares the same solid + playful savour
Intimate, romantic ambience
Tiny appetizers, biggish entrees
Not quite the great deal you might think it is
I was there on a Wednesday night and there was only one waiter, who also functioned as bartender busboy
He had a good attitude despite having to cover all the tables
There was probably only one cook in the kitchen because the food took a very long time
I had one of the finest dining experiences I've had in New York at Chubo
My girlfriend and I went there before a night out and loved it
It's small and cozy with a nice ambience
The waitress we had was quite nice and very attentive to our needs
The price was right and the food was excellent
(I had the hen and my girlfriend had the fish)
Highly recommended
when someone says everything in new york is expensive, i reply, yeah, if you don't know where to go
i discovered chubo 3 weeks ago, and i've been back there 3 times with different friends+families, and they all loved it
3-star meal is less than $40 per person with a drink and killer dessert!! the service could be better, but i think at the busy place like this, you just have to be a little aggressive to get servers' attention
i had no problem with it
What is not to like? I will answer that question with one word -- nothing
Everything about Chubo will keep me coming back for more, more, more
The food is mouth watering
I started with the chicken liver and unagi, followed by the hake fish, and then for dessert, the best cheesecake I have ever had
My dining partner had the salmon cake, then the chicken, followed by the chocolate roulade
In other areas, they have a small but well rounded wine selection and the server was pleasant, knowledgeable, and attentive

Another couple next to us received the same treatment, check on the table
meaning eat your food and SCRAM! Place was dead and it was during a rainstorm so there was no others waiting for tables
I don't even know where to begin with the delivery service that Patsy's provided
A friend and I ordered two pasta dishes along with soup and salad
Upon arrival (an hour and a half later), the food came in a bag full of oil and dressing
all of the food inside the bag including the containers and the rolls were completely drenched
On top of that, the order was incorrect
When we called to complain, the manager was not cooperative and did not offer anything in return for the poor service
Not only did she suffer from bad management skills, she was also more than unpleasant
Overall, bad food, bad service, and a management staff which should be replaced
There are not too many good pizza delivery places in Chelsea/Flatiron - thank god for Patsy's! Thin crust, great pepperoni
$25 for a pizza - but worth it
Seriously- This is the best eatin' in the city! I've had most everything on the HUGE menu, and ever entree has been FANTASTIC
The meatballs are the best (and biggest- softball size) in the city and the thin crust pizza is perfect
Its an italian restaurant but the menu has everything you can imagine, example: the BBQ ribs are INCREDIBLE
Its a fun place to go with friends, it feels comfortable, laid back, and is definitely not one of those stuffy, high priced eateries
In Short The details of this bakery's butter cookies, cut in myriad shapes and hand-iced in bold colors and designs, make its sweets instantly recognizable
Depending on the season, you may find snowmen, toy trains, champagne bottles, Cupids or jack-o-lanterns, as well as perennial taxis, red hearts, striped presents, butterflies and handbags
Party favors and themed tins, as well as buttercream-topped cupcakes, oatmeal cookies and heart-shaped brownies, are some of the sweets for gift-giving and on-the-spot nibbling
Surprised by previous review, I thought the decorative cookies tasted just like a shortbread/butter cookie should taste
Always something creative an unique
After hearing such rave reviews of their beautiful cookies I bought some for valentines day
The cookies are decorated nicely but nothing overly spectacular, (the printout things they put on cake)
The worst though was the taste
They were dry, stale and pretty flavorless
Almost like an english tea biscuit
Maybe this would be tolerable but for the price $5 for about a 3 cookie, my suggestion is to go elsewhere
Tasty maki and sushi and wonderful gyoza
They also have a bento box which is delicious and very reasonable
Excellent, attentive service
I had them make a platter for a party and it was very popular
My boyfriend and I go here every so often as the food is fairly reliable and good
The prices are a little above average, but not much so
They have great deals for lunch, and offer a discount for NYU students
They are pretty inattentive in terms of their service, and are terrible about refilling your water glasses
At the same time their servers are friendly
Although small, Moxa packs a big punch
Both their drip coffee and espresso are delightfully tasty (strong but not bitter)
Their soups are always right on, and the sandwiches are surprisingly fresh
Their prices and service beat other 'corporate' places, no contest
We just stopped in to get coffee on a Tuesday when the place was mostly empty
Water wasn't in glasses but plastic cups and the iced coffee was fair at best
The service was flakey as it seems to be run by 18 year old girls that just complain about boys they are dating while forgetting they've got to work
If the waitress is mad at him, she's mad at you
I went to the Caf Angelique for the first time a few days ago
It was a cold and windy Sunday and my friend and I were in dire need of a warm and comforting drink
The ridiculously long wait was not what we needed and, although our caff lattes were on the decent side, it really wasn't worth it
I also found the spot to be a tad too touristy for my taste and finally, the state of the restroom in this place is unforgivable
I had to wait a very long time when came here for Saturday lunch with a friend
Food was not good
Sandwich had mostly bread and was made probably two days ago
Is it done off premises? Girl waiter is not paying attention
For all my troubles I had to pay a very long bill
I am avoiding this place
So nice to find a classy, unpretentious spot for dinner
Love the salads, love the coffee, REALLY love the desserts
I've tried several spots in the Village area, and I keep coming back here
Waitstaff is always friendly
It's small, and it does get crowded, but it's nice to go by yourself or with a friend/date
Went on a Friday night with a friend
Service was just ok
Had a cannoli that was soggy
Also had the Tropical Tan smoothie, which didn't hit the spot
It just didn't have the right combination of mango, banana, canteloupe, and pineapple juice
Next time, I'll head to Little Italy for a genuine cannoli
Not going there again
This cafe is in my neighborhood and I go often
The desserts here are consistently great
The only bad thing is having to leave the dog outside while I go in for whatever delectable treat I've spied through the window
You can almost never go wrong with anything you choose from theirlarge selection
The only negative is having to put up with a crowd of silly tourits on busy nights
I love this place and eat here all the time
Their turkey pesto panini is so delicious
Ask them to add mint to a lemonade
Extra-yummy, especially for the summer
This is an awesome place! High quality sandwiches for low prices
Very good service
Also check out the location on 14th and 3rd ave for a great spot where you can sit down and enjoy the food
First off I never post reviews on anything but I have been to the one on 14th street b/w 2nd/3rd aves (open for about 6 months) and its great
Food is very cheap (try the exotic tuna), yet high quality (bread from balthazaar, cheese from Joe's Dairy, organic vegetables)
I had a Mediterranean salad loaded with vegetables, hummus, eggplant, very tasty
For 6 bucks it almost feels like you're (get this) underpaying
Place is a little small, but cool, nice selection of magazines if you're eatin' solo, and fast service
Owner is very friendly too
I will be back
This place is great
I love the exotic tuna sandwich and the hot chai
The people are super nice and the food is a great price and quality
No sitting at this location, but if your by Union Square check out their other location at 211 East 14st Street where there is indoor sitting
Enjoy!
Really yummy paninis for cheap! Try the prosciutto and mozzarella or the nutella panini! They also have non-alcoholic frozen mojitos
Only downside is there are only outside stools - which is only inconvenient bc the sandwiches are so big
The Scene At night, candles glow against this restaurant's silvery interior like pools of moonlight
A metallic bar and burnished open kitchen contrast the white-washed brick walls hung with local art, and ethereal indie music enhances the intimate mood
It won't be the cool and kindly servers who rush you out--it will be the other pretty patrons standing by in cramped quarters who are eyeing your meal's progress
The Food Though the name refers to goods procured from renowned bakery Balthazar down the block, Bread makes a name for itself with fresh and honest Italian fare
The bread stands out in signature sandwiches--namely the cheesy fontina panini with a buttery-soft crunch--but even loaf-less dishes exceed expectations
A hefty plate of flavorful meatballs arrives unadorned, sided by steamed peas and potatoes
Don't overlook the ever-popular, marinara-rich tomato soup, thickened with seasonings and Parmesan cheese
This is my first review on this site - I felt compelled to join after experiencing this strange place yesterday - never has my service been so poor and food so good

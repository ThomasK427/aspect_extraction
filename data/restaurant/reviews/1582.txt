Or maybe we were just nauseas from the laughably slow service
And when we politely informed our server we were in a bit of a hurry, it just seemed to slow down even more
CANTINEROS IS THE BEST RESTAURANT THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! THE FOOD IS GREAT, THE SERVICE IS GREAT AND THE SALSA AND CHIPS ARE TO DIIIEEE FOR!!!!!! CANTINEROS IS GOD!
My boyfriend and I have been twice in the past 2 weeks
Originally from TX, we haven't been able to find good Mexican food in NYC that isn't fru fru
This is pretty close to the Tex Mex in TX, and everything we've had has been great (fajitas, enchiladas, tacos)
The salsa is also fresh which is a plus, and the margaritas are great too!
Been here dozens of times, always good, great enchiladas
The food isn't drowned in cheese or sauce like most places are, but there also isn't a ton of fat on the meat like you get at some of the traditional places
Margaritas are generous and a good price
Been here twice in the past two weeks - it's GREAT! So fun, great space, great service, yummy food and great marg on the rocks! Will continue to go back time and time again! Fri and Sat night - might have to wait for a table! The guac portion is small, but it's OH SO good!
I've been going to this place for the last 10 years
The food and drinks are great
The place is cute
The outdoor patio is nice over the summer
The prices are good
I also had my birthday party here last year with about 50 people and everyone loved it
The staff was great
I came her for my birthday dinner last night, after a fiasco at Patsy's Pizza
The staff was cery accommodating of large groups, the food and drinks are great, and the prices are good
The waiter even provided a free round of shots upon hearing it was my birthday! Highly recommended
The food was decent, but nothing good, and is certainly not a place to go to for a really good meal
Everything was average across the board at best
Service was somewhat slow and disorganized, the food was greasy, and my tacos fell apart and were difficult to eat
I was full when I left, and they certainly give you plenty of food, but I'm not particularly eager to return there
I have been going to this restaurant for more than 5 years and its the best!! the waiters are cheerful and helpful, the food is excellent
very authentic, YES
greesy and real, how mexican food should be!! The drinks are excellent the margaritas are the best wether you like them frozen or on he rocks
i come go there for just drinks to celebrate an occasion or just to sit and have a good meal with good spanish music in the background
I liked this place a few years ago
I came here recently and was disappointed
The food was not very good
One of my guests ordered Quesadillas
They had a chicken bone in them! Also, I was surprised that the portions were not large
In the past I used to get plenty here
My brother was still looking for I don't think I'll be back
Some of my friends complained that the food is way too greasy, but I found the food to be a nice break from the fare that is served at most yuppie NYC Mexican restaurants
Upstairs there's a bar and salsa and merengue dancing on the weekends, which is a lot of fun
the first time i went was for the great $3 happy hour frozen margaritas and free chips
this was a weekday and i was meeting up with a friend
but when i returned for a friday night happy hour, the place had turned into a cheesy, loud party
yuck
and the food is greasy and bad
but i'd go back for a weeday happy hour for sure!
What an AWFUL experience! The quesadillas were drenched in grease, the meat was a piece of rubber, and the seafood
don't get me started
Besides the mediocre food, the unattractive atmosphere, and the overpriced menu
the drinks were disgusting
We tried the margaritas, the sangria, and the pina coladas; believe me, NOTHING was good!
Me and my friends have ben her numerous times
The food is delcious and the environment FUN!! go with a huge group of friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
a traditional red sauce place full of stuy-town people, lots of regulars--i love their eggplant parm with angelhair in oil and garlic on the side---eggplant sliced so thin, lots of layers--and huge portion that i usually get 3 meals out of 1 order
Everyone thinks he knows where the best pizza is in NYC
For my money, there is no better slice than that from the Adriatic
Dining room fare is ok, but stick to the pizza
In Short Inside this Southern watering hole, you'll find the standard kitschy lunchboxes, neon signs and rusty license plates
You'll also find a whole lot of people having a great time, seeking a happy hour refuge with oversized plates of ribs carried to the table with lots of extra napkins
Other Southern staples include BBQ chicken wings, burgers and beer
Love the Duke-a-Ritas! menu not too extensive reasonable price Cute waitresses and every game on the 6 plasma screens
Hmmm, sure the food is great and the atmosphere is rockin' but
every single time I have gone (I work in entertainment/fashion and have a bevy of very beautiful female friends that I've been there with) we've noticed that our food is repeatedly served up with a side order of animosity from the more immature waitresses on staff who--eye candy though they may be--cannot seem to handle a sweeter piece of eye candy than themselves and seem to feel the need to resort to insecure and hostile hatin' behavior
Too bad, leaves a nasty taste in one's mouth
so sad, since otherwise it's a great place
this place is the best for burgers and beers, I have been going to watch the world cup every day, food is great and the beers are cold
I thank you duke for making my life so super duper
This establishment features some of the most beautiful men and women of Manhattan in their staff, probably a collection of wannabe actors/models or something thereof
Clearly they're thinking of themselves as they seemingly forgot about us and other customers
Service was unattentive, flirty but not necessarily friendly, and managed to get NO tip from me
The food tasted like something from a chain restaurant like TGI Friday's, Bennigan's, or Applebee's, which was just fine
The decor was about the same as the food, very chain-like but not unique
The bathrooms were nice, the beer was good, and the prices were fair
Overall, the place is alright but the service needs some work
I was a little trepidatious after reading the review titled horrible, but my friends were having a party there so I went
I was very happy
The service was great and I thought the margaritas were actually a little too strong
There are so few laid back places in the city that actually work hard to make sure you have a good time
This is one of them
Perhaps she went on an off night
We had a fabulous time and can't wait to go back!!
Been coming here for five years now, can't say enough for this comfy cool spot, great for drinks, to watch games, grab a bite or just chill  gotta love duke's
Dukes is a great place to enjoy simple, easy good food! The girls that work there are cute and friendly as are the patrons (guys and girls)
It was crazy busy when I went there with a group of friends (we did have a reservation) and everyone had a great time
The nachos are delicious!
The food is ehn
My baked beans were hard
which leads me to believe that they aren't baked at all, just normal undercooked beans with bbq sauce on them
The brisket wasn't very tender, though it was flavorful
But beware the beer! There are no prices posted and our pitcher of Yuengling was a whopping $18!!!!! Then we were told that they were very busy and we had to leave even though we had 1/2 of our precious beer left
Un-freaking-believable
Less oil guys! Seemed like greasy recooked midwestern food
Calamari and bloddy Marys however were surprisely good
The chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, BBQ sandwich, and other dishes are tasty comfort food
Otherwise, I don't recommend this restaurant for anyone over 25 or anyone who likes good service
Sure, the waitresses are hot, but you'll have to wait 30 minutes just to get your drinks
It's a great place if you want to relive your fraternity years
The food is blah and the service is slow
But, Duke's is a fun place to grab a drink and enjoy the trailer-park ambiance
went to college in the south, this is the first place in NYC that reminds me of the good old days
I went with some friends to catch the yankees and drink some beers
Ended up eating a burger and picked up a cutie ( I am know dating )

Sushi lovers watch out, Kyoto Sushi is one of the best restaruants to go to for great japanese food
I am a huge fan of sushi and I have to say that Kyoto has it perfect
I've been in the neighborhood for almost ten years and I have yet to find a restaruant around here that would be able to match up to kyoto's Sushi
I this past weekend to Kyoto with a group of friends to celebrate his bday
The service that we received was top notch and the meals were moderately priced
The sushi was extremely fresh and the portion was generously sized
If you are looking for a great sushi place to eat in Queens, Kyoto Sushi is the place to be
*For desert, try the mouth watering Fried Ice Cream~ It's to die for
Came here for a double date and it was awesome
The sake and food really hit the spot
Best part, I didn't have to trek all the way out to Manhattan and look for parking
Brought my mom there for mothers day
Great food at great value! The decor is great along with great service
Try okinawa salmon if you get a chance
Lucky for me, in a recent visit to Queens, friends took me to one of their favorite neighborhood restaurants, Kyoto Sushi
Loved the ambience and minimal decor
Service was attentive but unobtrusive and the food was beautifully presented a feast for the eyes
Most importantly, the food was fresh and delicious, combining interesting flavors
It also helped that the bill didnt put a dent in the pocketbook! Will definately be returning
i was there last weekend for a birthday party, it was nothing closed to what i was expecting
the sushi wasn't fresh, the kitchen food was over cooked
the waiter who served us was rude
In fact he insulted my friends
It was not an experince worth mentioning
i was highly disappointed
i would not recommended my friends to go there
Probably one of the few restaurants in Queens w/ the cool decor + ambient! Good food, too :)  When I was there, there were a few small kids, even babies
It's nice that the restaurant accomandate them
To keep it cool, it's probably better not allowing small children
Making reservation means nothing at this restaurant
In fact, people who arrived before my party left! There were over 4 tables available and the reason we were not seated for over 15 minutes was because the tables had to be cleared
While the host milled around avoiding the customers who were asking why they had made reservations only to wait 30-40 minutes, not one waiter or busboy appeared to clear any tables
The service was awesome here
The staff is attentive the service was fast
They were really interested in any suggestions, comments, criticisms we had
We had absolutely no complaints
The atmosphere is relaxing the decor was pleasant
The tatami booths are cool too
I did not feel at all rushed like some of those snobby places in Manhattan
The meal was delicious
I would definitely come back again!
I'm a huge sushi fan and I've almost always have been disappointed with japanese restaurants in Queens
But Kyoto has definitely gotten the decor, food and waitstaff service right
I LOVED the spicy tuna tartar - it was so good I had to order 2
I loved that the food is fusion
Finally, a great Japanese restaurant in Queens
I highly recommend it
I highly recommend this place! Kyoto is located in Queens and is easy to get to
My girlfriends and I dont have to travel all the way to the city for some fine dining
We really enjoyed the food, the dcor and the staff
The spicy tuna tar tar was incredible and the sashimi/ sushi rolls were fresh
The green tea ice cream was delicious
The decor of the place was very unique
The tatami wood brings out the authentic Japanese restaurant feel
The price was reasonable
The staffs were nice, and attentive
The owner and the manager were genuinely interested in what we thought of the food and the place
Everything in one great restaurant! Cant really find anything like this in the city
We will definitely go back to try more great food!
great food, beautiful place, and better yet an unbelievable value
recommend everyone to go :O)
Had dinner here with my wife and the sushi is absolutely fabulous
The spicy tuna tar tar is a must try
The best I ever had
Food was great and so was the service
Very friendly staff
Went with a group of friends from the city - was a bit of a drive but was worth the trip! Great food and great service
Just BYOB!
Finally, a nice and authentic Japanese restaurant in the Queens area - I would always have to drive out to the city for fresh sushi but since discovering Kyoto Sushi, there's no need for that anymore
The staff is super friendly and the price is reasonable
Plus the private tatami booths are a nice touch to the decor of the restaurant
My family and I had a wonderful dining experience and would highly recommend it
The residents must be thrilled about this new addition to their neighborhood
Tastefully decorated, the ambiance sets the mood for a night to relax and dine on delicious dishes
For the entertainment seekers, request a seat at the sushi bar to watch the chefs prepare your meal
For those who are adventurous at heart, request a private booth (but be ready to take off your shoes,it's traditional Japanese dining here)
The privacy will impress your date
Did I mention the Thai menu is as extensive as their Japanese menu? I say mix and match until your stomach is content
For an appetizer, the Duck Salad is a must
The sushi is so fresh and you won't go wrong with the Thai Calamari
Kyoto is one of the few restaurants where you can get an order of Ginger ice-cream
But with so many choices, I'm sure you'll find your own favorites
You don't usually find sushi spots like this unless you're in manhattan or japan
The sushi was fresh and the service was impeccable
My girlfriend and I had a great experience here and we will be sure to return again
Highly recommended for people who don't want to make the trip over to manhattan for a quality meal
In Short The compact interior of this Park Slope cafe has the look of a 1920s European dining car, with refined orange walls, a stand-up espresso bar and a long wooden bench with connected classroom-style tables running along one side
La Colombe coffee, Jacques Torres hot chocolate and pastries from Marquet are some of the specialties
The space is very Euro and quite charming, quaint, cute, cozy! To bad this city is to intent on laptops and to-go cups
If this place wants to be a Paris inspired cafe it should only have to-stay service and no stupid laptops
I'm sick of people using cafe's as their offices
This cafe should discourage such behavior
Where is the conversation and desire to have a great coffee? Especially in the Slope! Their coffee is sometimes wonderful sometimes bland
Not very consistant
Sometimes a latte is beutifully presented and tastes perfect without any sugar, other times it is to hot and you can't taste the espresso
Depends on who makes it
A few of the daytime gentlemen are superb
They are your best bet for a great coffee in the hood
I wish they had beer and wine
The menu has a lot of interesting items

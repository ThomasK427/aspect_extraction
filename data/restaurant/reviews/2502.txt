The food was alright, but the red sangria really was good
If you are looking for a quite, relaxing dinner this is not the place
Tonight I and seven members of my family went to this awesome (though somewhat loud) restaurant
The food was fantastic though I would not disagree with some that it is somewhat overpriced
It is not your typical mexican fare, bu the mariachi band makes you forget that
The margaritas were terrific! Most of all, what made my night that much more enjoyable, my five-year-old daughter had a blast! She danced to the band, talked loudly (the way that children will do), had balloon hats made by the ballon hat lady and through all of this disturbed no one
That alone made the night totally worth it for me! Not for first dates, or lovey-doveyness, do bring a group of friends and dig in! You've got to try this place!
Once again I've brought a first timer to Mama Mexico and they tell me the next day that it is their new favorite restaurant in Manhattan
Check it out for a different dining experience
Guacamole made at your table, great drinks and good food - reminds me of Texas
This place is a truly authentic mexican restaurant, down to the paper-mache and festive lights that hang from the ceiling
A band is always there playing mexican music, and the bartenders are known for pouring tequilla down their patrons throats
The guacamolle is a must, they make it fresh in front of you when you order it
They've got great burritos as well, and their margaritas are amoung the best in the city
Waiters are friendly and attentive, and the seats are a little on the small side, but still comfortable
Not the cheapest Mexican food around, but worth the money
The food is great! The service is great! The best place to eat and have a great time
You need to try this for yourself
I love going to restaurants, and I think this one has the distinction of being my least favorite restaurant in all of Manhattan
The food is so overpriced and totally mediocre, they charge about 13 bucks for a plate consisting of a flour tortilla with cheese and a few chicken chunks
It's so loud and unpleasant
Stay away!!
Great place to go eat
After reading other posts, I suggest you go when it's not busy
Myself and two other friends went when the restaurant had five other people in it
The service was great and the food was delicious (especially the guacamole)
The food was a little pricy, but I think it's worth it
As a Mom of an Active Toddler, this is the only place my husband and I enjoy our meal
The service is amazing and the music is very entertaining
My son is always is so absorbed by all the activitity at the restaurant
We love the food and especially the very friendly staff
The service should be a model to all other restaurants
We have been to the restaurant many times and never been disappointed
A fun, lively and Kid-friendly place
Had a late lunch there and was initially put off by their asking for drink and guacamole orders before we were handed the menus
But after that, all was well
The staff is great (or at least meant well), the fun was all tasty and seemed to be of a high quality and the drinks were pretty awesome
I hear brunch rocks the house
I made a reservation for 12 people for 8:00 on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday
When we arrived at the restaurant on time, we were made to wait 40 minutes for our table
Does RESERVATION mean anything? We spoke to the hostess to see if the manager would maybe help us out because of our extended wait
She said that she had spoken to the manager and he said that something would be done
Well
it turns out that they didn't help us out at all, and when a member of the party asked the manager about it, he rudely replied 'Sometimes people with reservations wait for 2 HOURS
you're not getting a discount on ANYTHING'
these are some of the nicest people who extend a sincere welcome to all and serve the freshest and tastiest food around
Having the waiter prepare your Guacamole from scratch next to your table is very impressive and starts your dining experience on a good note
The food was very fresh and well prepared, service was excellent, and as far as ambiance goes you really do feel as if youre in Mexico
The band does get a bit loud but the important thing is that they can sing
For an excellent experience make reservations and go with a group
It's best to make reservations before you go because it gets crowded
But it is worth it, great food, great setting, lots of fun
Great celebration atmosphere, with Mariachi band, and great food, including imaginative specials
Best guacamole and Frozen Margaritas I've had
Mediocre at best
the fat politician is mildly amusing though
I had a blast! A bunch of my girlfriends and I decided to check out Mama Mexico after seeing it on the Food Network
I figured how could you go wrong?! I will admit
I wasn't happy about the 20 minute wait by the door with 15 others but everyone seated inside kept saying it's worth the wait
And it was! The service was good, the drinks were great and you must try the lamb
Don't forget to get quacamole made at your table (it's $10 extra) I told the waitress it was my cousin's birthday and they brought out a cake and the mariachi band played at our table
To top it off, the manager poured shots of Vodka into our mouths! It was like the whole restaurant was celebrating her birthday with us
It was too much fun!
Mama Mexico is fantastic, and you can tell by the throngs of Latin people who are always there
Latin people know good Mexican - and this is it
Mexican food isn't supposed to be chi-chi, it's hearty, basic food
The margaritas are fantastic, mariachi music is fun, and the price is right
Yes service isn't amazing b/c it's always soooo crowded, but it's solid and perfectly acceptable
Make a reservation, go in a big group, drink tequila and have a blast
The music is obnoxious, the waiters are terrible and unhelpful
The food is mediocre at best
Also, be wary, they are known to overchage
They make the absolute best fresh guacamole at your table
It's a little pricey, but my friends and I always get specials and split them
They're giant portions, so we're always full
It's really worth going for the guac, margaritas and the band
the best mexican food around

The place is great if your looking to have a party
The margaritas are delicious and come in many flavors
The food is not so good though and the wait to be seated is a little worse
But, it is worth a look especially to party
Friends of ours have mentioned going to this place forever
In one word 'disappoitment'
This was by means not great Mexican or even great food
Our medium guacomole was bland, the rice was orange, and my beef fajitas consisted or a few pieces of meet and a plate of onions
Holiday! Refreshing pomegranate margaritas, wonderful fresh salsa and friendly staff
My daughter and I love to dance to the mariachi band (which, just like in Tijuana, includes an unmuted trumpet and acoustic bass)
Authentic? You bet!
LOVED THIS PLACE!!! I am a mexican food connosieur
Everything from the chips, salsa and quacamole to the beef and chix enchiladas was terrific
The service was impeccable
There was so many people on the wait staff that we never waited more than 2 minutes for refills on chips, salsa and drinks
and we needed a lot of refills!!! The marachi band was great and everyone seemed to be having a festive experience

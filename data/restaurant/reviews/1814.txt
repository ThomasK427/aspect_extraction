You will not be disappointed
I went to Francisco's with a friend and the food was absolutely amazing
I'd recommend getting an appetizer b/c the dinner takes a bit to be cooked, but it was definitely worth the wait
A friend of mine and I wondered into this place on a whim one evening
The dining room is dimly lit, pleasant but cramped
The food was basic Thai, nothing new
The pad thai was especially tasty
The wait staff, though freindly and I must say patient (my friend is difficult) but keep returning to the table every few minutes to check-up on guests
It's courteous but becoms annoying after several times
I wouldn't return to this place for the fact that it has nothing much to offer
I had better Thai fare
The most striking feature of this otherwise unremarkable joint is its spectacular hot table/salad bar
With everything from fried chicken and ribs to marinated tofu and Caesar salad, it's a real lunch-time revelation
Sandwiches, etc
are also available, as are beaucoup de beverages, but believe me, it's the table that's the piece de resistance
If you're looking for a cheap lunch in Greenwich village, this is a prime option
This dungeon of delicious Mexican food is literally a hole in the wall on the south east corner of 23rd 6th
But it is the best Mex I've had, hands down
The quesdilla de chorizo is outrageous, and the burritos are huge and delicious
Average, gut-busting meal is $5
50 How can you go wrong!? Its decor is dirty but the food is clean, trust me -- try it!
I'm a big fan of Burritos (as my waistline will attest) and a fairly adventurous eater, but this place was one trek I could have lived without
The ambience doesn't particularly matter to me as this place is essentially a take-out stand
What does matter, however, is that I can identify the contents of my burrito, which I was unable to do at this establishment
Both my colleague and I were inquiring about the mystery meat, at least the portions of it that would not be classified as fat and grizzle
To say my experience was disappointing would be a gross understatement
Simply put, NYC has a lot of other places to try, which I plan to do, and I encourage you to do the same
More of a takeout place with only 4 crowded tables, Great Burrito offers some of the most authentic, tasty, and cheap Mexican food within miles
Don't be turned off by the fact that they serve pizza as well - the tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas are outstanding
The best roast pork (al pastor) in the city
This is really incredible pizza
I don't know exactly what it is
I think its the crust
but its so delicious
If you're in the area, definitely try the pizza here and you'll be hooked
I am sincerely disappointed in the service at Ray's (at 53rd and 7th)
The woman who works at the register has repeatedly offended my race, and put her saliva in my food
Not only do I think this branch should be shut down, but I think this woman should be arrested for her inappropriate views
I call upon the owner's of the franchise to correct this situation
I have been accosted on SEVERAL occasions
DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU WANT TO PROMOTE THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT
I will never go to there again
I have never been more offended in my life
If you hate pizza with a lot of cheese on it, than you probably shouldn't be coming here; however, if you like cheese, you will leave very happy
The added toppings on by the slice pieces is excellent, and they maintain an interesting variety of slices
Also, the prices are not bad
The service is fairly quick as well
There are some better pizza places out there, but Ray's is still good, and you can't go wrong if you live in the area
There's so much cheese on these slices it's gross
This place has changed hands so many times in the last 10 years that you can go in any given day and see strangers manning the cash register
It had the BEST pizza when it opened a million years ago
Unfortunately, that's a memory
I don't go here anymore
Yes, it *is* all about the cheese, just lifting one of these cheese-laden slabs constitutes a workout imho! Forget all the other Ray's - this is THE one
Having grown up in Brooklyn, I know a good slice a good square when I come across one
Rocco's sicilian seems to get better everytime I have one
One of my biggest problems with the pizza in this neighborhood is the sauce, which is either too sweet or plain crushed tomatoes
Rocco's is wonderfully seasoned reminds me of the stuff I got years ago in Sheepshead Bay
Regular slices are great too, but their sicilian blows everything else out of the water!
The pizza and heros here are top notch, and the folks behind the counter are extra nice
Big Cup is amazing, they have a great selection of desserts and the coffee is much improved after they changed vendors the first of the year
Prices are consistently lower than that other big chain
Anyone around for over eight years must be doing something right! keep up the good work
It looks nice
Its a happenin spot
Its full of cute boys
But where do they get off charging $2
17 for a small cup of tea
Mind you, this was Celestial Seasonings tea
Where? Rather than having the great experience I thought I was going to have, I couldn't help but feel like a fool sipping my 2 dollar tea
I decided to not return unless I had to
I have been there several times and it is a wonderful atmosphere sometimes
The music is good and the people watching is excellent
This is a must do for anyone visiting NYC
It's been years since this place has burst on the scene and for some reason, it's still as popular as ever
Though as a friend once put it, who actually goes to Big Cup for the coffee or desserts anyway? People come here to check the guys out before heading to a real bar or club
Come here if you want to see the boys, not if you want a decent cup of coffee or latte
When I first came to NYC looking for a career, I wandered into this NewsBar location
There they made the best Cappucino I'd ever had
There sugar stand was clean and their brownies were outrageous
But the minute I reached for a hard-to-find design magazine, I made a friend and knew that this place was special
this is not a restaurant, it is a factory that processes people; great locale means an easy audience, but the food is a commodity: who ever serves black beans that are cold? service is less than non-existant; a waiter flits by, drops a menu in your lap, hurriedly takes your order, and this is the last you see of the waitor; your food is delivered by a member of the kitchen staff, racing to deliver in the arcade environment; the thing that floored me was the waiter droping the desert menu under my elbow as she flew to another part of the restaurant, no words, no check in, no nothing, imagining that i would order
a big fat zero, the place feels like a rest-stop
this is the on-going suburbanization of NYC
we should have clued in when the hostess appeared 30 minutes after 3 groups had been waiting
I have been coming here regularly for a few years and this place has never failed to please
This time I ordered from the lunch special menu: Ensalada de la Casa, Enchilada Suizas, and Chocolate Cake
The salad is one of few that I always eat
It is fresh and tasty - made with lettuce, pico de gallo, and shredded cheese - I usually top it off with their salsa
The chicken enchiladas come with tomatoes, lettuce, spanish rice and black beans, cooked to perfection
The enchiladas are covered with a smooth green sauce that, although it is not spicy, it adds a lovely depth too the plate
Although I have read that people have gotten bad service, that has never been my experience
In fact, my water and salsa bowl were refilled without asking
My waiter was very polite and friendly and fast
Went there on a slow Tuesday night for a friends birthday
What a mistake
We sat for an hour and they waiter came by once
When we got up to leave and the waiter tried to charge us 18% for the two mediocre apetizers and one drink they did serve us
Also, about a year back we went there for a party
The management refused to open the coat check even though we were a huge group (150)

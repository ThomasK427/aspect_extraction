We tried the prix fixe 8 course dinner with the salt encrusted black cod as the main meal
The fish is cooked in a thick salt/egg crust which is broken up right before you eat and is not for eating
Wow!  The courses are small, thank god; It is so hard to get small portions in the U
S
now
The food is an experience
Get ready to spend some serious time enjoying the company of your friends
Service exceptional: unobtrusive, friendly
This is authentic Japanese food - California roll is not on the menu
Ambience - minimalist
Gotta love minimalism
With sake and tip walked out for $100 a person
Can't wait to come back
Omakase course is beautiful and so delicious
You can enjoy real Japanese tea, since this restaurant is managed ItoEn, Teas' Tea company
They will give it to you as a souvenir!!
We just ate at Kai and were disapointed
The food was not very tasty, the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant
And the prices were way to high for what you get
Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms where $12 for about 1oz
We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got
The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better
!!
I love sushi, japanese, asian fusions, and eat it a lot, and just wasn't amazed here
The atmosphere, staff and food were all nice, but that's it
Compared to other reviews, I thought it was only average
I will say that the mushrooms were excellent
However, many of the accompanying sauces (presented on the fish, even the sashimi) overpower the fish
The sauce on the soba noodles was very salty for the simple taste/texture of the noodles
I can't say I hated it because there was nothing really wrong, but nothing that great either
I love Japanese food for the simplistic presentation, preparation, and use of superb ingredients and how it concentrates on the quality, taste, and respect for the food, not the chef's ability to create complex sauces or infused tastes
The presentation is very cool, but I missed the flavorful standalone qualities that quality seafood has elsewhere
All the staff is absolutely professional!! I sometimes see the waiters don't have enough knowledge of their dishes
But they do
(that is A MUST, but not every restaurant can do
) If you want to dine with large party, I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT
There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more)
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area
I had a great experience
Food is great
Service is top notch
I have been going back again and again
This place puts other overpriced Japanese restaurants to shame
Both fusion dished and Japanese dishes are excellent, and service is superb
Certainly not cheap, but its worth every penny
If your there, might as well pay up and get the expensive omakase - will not disappoint
Incredible! One of the greatest meals in NYC
Don't you get tired of the new american and the dainty french cuisine? Those restaurants may be good, but they're all the same - chilean sea bass, foie gras, venison, duck, blah, blah, blah
you name it
This place offers food that is out of the ordinary, service that is unparalled and an incredible tea selection
It's very down to earth, no attitude and comfortable
Have already recommended to all my friends
Will definitely go back for another special night out
Excellent presentation of service and food
Interesting and unique food flavors, comfortable atmosphere, knowledgeable service staff, well-thought wine/sake/tea list
I went thinking I was going to eat sushi but this isn't a sushi-house
Regardless, I have to say that I was not disappointed
Ever little piece of food that was on my plate had such a distinct taste
You can tell that it was well thought out
I was impressed with the service
I had 3 people wait on me at all times
The decor needs some work but you become so engrossed in your meal that it didn't even matter
Kai is by far one of our favourite restaurants in Manhattan, with its minimalism and simplicity and food served with minute perfectionism
Every dish is an absolute winner
If you try just one restaurant then it should be this one! Attention to detail
Minimalistic and refined would be the best way to describe Kai
The presentation is hauntingly simple
The mixture of textures and flavors experienced through the meal are perfected through painstaking attention to detail
The teas offered throughout the meal are excellent
Mood and quality are controlled expertly by the staff
To top off my meal, I ordered excellent Daiginjo type chilled sake which was a perfect compliment to the meal
Definitely go to Kai for a sophisticated and interesting meal
In constant search of a great Japanese restaurant, Kai brought to you what an experience in the art of kaiseki style dining should be
The wait staff was accommodating, informative and on the ball
The food was impeccably presented, every course had an interesting palate of flavors that fused well, fresh and delicious
you will not be disappointed
Wonderful selection of Japanese teas as well
The decor is very simple
minimal, stark, but chic
What a transporting experience
every course served was a feast to the eyes
I thought the Salt Crusted Cod with Tea Leaves was just magical
and the handmade soba noodles perfectly executed! My Japanese host said it was better than the ones she has had in Japan
Thrilled on my new discovery
Very inventive, beautifully displayed food
Excellent service
Overall, a fine experience unlike any other
My challenge is to find Sushi for my business partner who only eats the best Sushi
I found it here at Kai, fresh, authentic but free-style and the service, which is just as important as the food, was A+
who is the decorator
The Scene Butter's dining room is beautiful and airy, with high arched ceilings and a giant back-lit photo of a birch forest
Though sentinels guard the door, the decor is almost enough to reassure you that this is a serious restaurant
Service is warm and knowledgeable, if at times forgetful
The Food The American menu features a laundry list of trendy ingredients
Standout entrees include delicious grilled ostrich with polenta, white asparagus and bone marrow
In other cases, a showy effect detracts from an otherwise fine dish: Olives, for example, diminish the flavor of perfectly grilled mackerel, and sea bass is overwhelmed by garlic
I usually dine at Butter about three times a month and have to say, and I really enjoy it! The food is consistenly great, wine and atmosphere
everything
We selected Butter for its location, not its reviews
We'd been to Gramercy Tavern the night before

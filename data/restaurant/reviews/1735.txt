fresh and well-seasoned with plenty of cilantro and radishes
And the cheese kulcha from Bread Bar is cheesy turmeric-y heaven
For main courses, we had the tapioca-crusted soft-shell crab, which was good but average
Much more exotic sounding than it tasted
We had baby lamb and baby pig which were both utterly juicy and delicious
We all ordered the Peralta KO because it's made with Lichido, and it did not disappoint
It was excellent, but could have used a lot more of the lychee Lichido flavor we've come to love
And, of course, we got all the desserts on the menu and shared
My favorite was, by far, the Tahitian Vanilla Bean Kulfi
It came with perfect sweet-sour cherries, and tasted like a cross between vanilla ice cream and pudding
And it was great
Overall, an excellent dining experience
I recently visited NYC and the concierge of my hotel recommended Tabla to us as a good place to dine
I was speechless with the gorgeous interior of the restaurant
The hosts are very gracious and warm, not intimidating as compared to most upscale restaurants
They make you feel welcome and relaxed
We were seated promptly, by a window table which we requested
I was surprise with the Champagne toast from the concierge who booked our dinner
My vacation just got better
The service was outstanding, very professional
They know exactly when to approach the table, or when to wait
The Goan Crab Cake was outstanding
The succulent lump crabmeat crisped to a golden brown bursts with lively flavors of ginger, coriander, chiles and other spices that enhance the dish and not overwhelm the natural flavours
When I asked the waiter how they do the Crab Cake, he explained everything to us, which is remarkable; they really know how to train their staff
Aside from the explanation, he came back a few minutes later with a recipe card
This is how I rate hospitality, every little thing counts! Professional service can be a good thing, but outstanding hospitality is hard to find
The chutneys are also very good
We really enjoyed the naan breads as well
The fusion of American dish with Indian spices marries well
There are many American restaurants all over the US, and there are also many Indian restaurants
If you put the best of both together, that is how I would define the cuisine at Tabla
Flavours at its best, hospitality beats the rest
To Chef Floyd Cardoz, and the entire staff of Tabla and Bread Bar, thank you for giving us the best restaurant experience in NYC! Until out next visit!
As soon as I entered the restaurant I already felt very warm and very much welcome as the hosts greeted me and my guest
Almost like I was expected right that very moment, they recognized me right away from my previous visit for lunch
The night atmosphere at the restaurant has transformed the professional and business-like lunch atmorsphere to an elegant and romantic setting
The gleaming wooden staircase is lined with candles that seem to cast a magical glow on the whole place
The mosaics even look lovelier than ever
I had a Tablatini to start and it is officialy my favorite New York cocktail
We had the five course tasting menu and this might not have enough space to describe each and every dish, but everything was exquisite
The naan breads are very good
Adventures in spice made the food at Tabla a great experience for foodies who are always looking for something new and different
I always recognaize the flavors of Turmeric, Cumin, and Curry
The portions are good, and not overwhelming
You always look forward to the next dish
it can only get better
The $25 lunch prixe-fixe is a VERY GOOD VALUE! I have impressed many clients, partners, family and friends
Lunch at Tabla is a different atmosphere, business casual
Good for ladies who do lunch, and you will really enjoy the view of the park whether it's a lovely day, a romantic rainy afternoon or a snow covered day, sipping tea with a view is a good way to brighten your mid-day
My wife and I went to Tabla for our anniversary and had a memorable time
The staff greeted us with champagne and made sure that we had an excellent evening
After being to many three star restaurants, I have decided for the price, Tabla offers the best value in town
The ambiance is lively, food delicious with great flavors and a caring staff made our 10th anniversary just perfect
Spent $220 including tip wine on a dinner for two
I had expected something special, if not to say outstanding for that price
I was disappointed
I didn't taste anything that reminded me of Indian food, nothing spicy, nothing exotic
Small portions
Only one vegetarian dish on the main course
Waiters were professional and provided prompt courtesy
The room was very loud
At the next table they were apparantly doing a wine tasting - very disturbing
It was at times difficult to have a normal conversation
Won't go to Tabla again
The Indian food at Tabla is rather bland
Apart from the duck samosas I found nothing I liked
Once again we have a NYC restaurant that is more hype than substance
I have been to Tabla twice, once during restaurant week in the summer of 2005 and then again in December 2005
Each time I ate at this restaurant, the food was creatively prepared and delicious, and the serice was excellent
The items from the bread bar brought to our table were wonderful, especially the whole wheat naan
Our waittress was very attentive and even brought us an extra dessert and tastings of new items from the chef
I loved this restaurant, and I would definitely go back again
Excellent place to visit casually with friends
Relaxed yet elegant and food is good too
There are decent vegetarian choices
Tabla used to be very good and deserved its high rating of 9
7 in the last few years
However, I noticed a big change during my last night visit: price is up by 10% in comparison to what it was just half a year ago and the quantity in each course is increased, but the quality is SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED
I don't know whether they have changed their chef or just business strategy, either way it was definitely a terrible move -- a move that made this used to be distiniguished upscale restaurant to be one of the average New York restaurant
What a great pity!!!!
I went to Tabla for dinner last Saturday and the experience was just breath taking
The food was delightful, the service was impeccable, the ambience was awesome
This is a wonderful place and I highly recommend it
Food is overcooked and too oily
Also, the speed at which dishes arrive suggest that everything is pre-prepared to the extent that they are essentaily serving microwaved food
Definitely does not taste or look fresh
They gave us a free dessert when they saw we left a lot of food on our plates
The dessert itself was unfortunately underwhelming - a mountain of calories without the payback in terms of taste or intensity
Needless to say but we did not finish that as well
This restaurant has clearly chosen to maximize customer churn and food quality has suffured as a result
One can see what the chef was aiming for; the actual fare is then doubly disappointing
From the time we walked through the door to the time we left, we were treated as if our presence was completely appreciated by the staff
The service did not miss a beat
As if that weren't enough, the food was some of the best I have had in quite some time
My friend and I shared the crab cake over avacado sald and the blue fin tuna tartar for appitizers
Highly recommend both! I had the cod for my entree, and I must say it was one of the freshest, buttery fliets of fish I have been served in NYC
The desserts at Tabla were amazing as well - the vanilla kulfi is a staple there- try it, and you'll see why
I have been to the best restaurants in NYC, and this ranks in the top three!
The ambience and service here are great but the food was really awful
no flavor, bland, definitely not worth the really high price

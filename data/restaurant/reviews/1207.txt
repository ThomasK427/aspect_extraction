The sushi is not too impressive, and the place is a little pricey, but for the bayside/flushing area, it really is worth checking out
The ambiance is great though and they servers (although the ones in training are a little slow) are very friendly
When I want sushi and don't feel like going to the city, this is the placce I go
Karaoke, huge projection screens, a fish tank IN the bar, cool dance music, and oh yeah, pretty good sushi are all here at Sushi Rock! From the first day I went here for my girlfriend's birthday, the staff has treated us very well
We came back a few months ago with a larger party for another birthday, and once again, the staff went all out to make sure everyone had a good time
They're still new, but I really hope Sushi Rock does well
With all they have to offer, I'm sure they will
This place is farley new, first thing I noticed when it first opened up, are the projector screens on the wall behind the bar
Since I love sushi I decided to give it a shot
A lady friend and I went on a Saturday night, the place is pretty big but wasn't really packed at all
I got my Sapporo, Sake, and ordered the Spicy Tuna/Spicy Salmon and a SpiderRoll to test out
And to be quite honest we weren't all really that impressed, the rolls are average at best
In the end I don't think I would go back there if I do I'd have to try something else besides sushi :\ It just seemed like the place was trying too hard
It's still new so only time will tell
Overall I'd Still Recommend Checking it out
Don't expect a good time with a date here
The noise level is horrible
Food looks good but tastes only decent
A bit overpriced
I like the decor, but wouldn't consider it romantic
Waiter service a bit slow also
Maybe it was due to short staff
Feels like this place belongs in the city, but unlike the city this place actually has friendly service
I never felt more welcome and comfortable in a restaurant before
The food was exquisite and plentiful
The food also comes out looking as appetizing as it taste
Dont forget to order a drink or five, they're outstanding and compliment the food perfectly
as much as i like sushi, this restaurant had more than sushi to offer
their pad thai was so good that i was confused for a thai restaurant
You have to try their lychee martini! dragon roll, sushi rock roll(my favorite), and volcano are my recommendation in this place
i thank my friend for recommenting this place to me and i want to recommend this place to everyone~!!! karaoke! was the bomb! but make sure to have few drinks before you sing front of all those people!
Excellent food preparation!! Looks so nice you don't want to eat it
Once you do, absolutely DELICIOUS!! 3 HUge projection TV's to view, AWSOME SERVICE, Full bar, set up is beautiful, great place to go after work or for a date
You just feel like you're in a 5 star restaraunt treated like the president!!!
Wow! Big Screen TVs!!! First I thought it was a new bar and later realized that it was a modern Japanese restaurant
You got to try their daily special rolls!! Great FOOD!! Great Service!! I Love this place!!!
I highly recommend this restaurant
The food is EXCELLENT
Service was great
I had my birthday party here and they really treat you like a king
I like the huge projector screens
Great ambience and decor
The Scene The casual pub atmosphere translates well for the neighborhood crowd--young, old, families, singles--that packs the restaurant's wooden tables
A traditional bar, British band posters and knickknacks hanging from the walls completes the look from across the ocean
The Food The main event--the battered and crisply fried fish, available as cod, haddock or plaice--arrives atop a mountain of authentic thickly cut chips, to be liberally dashed with vinegar
To complete the gastro journey of fried goodness, there's a gooey side of fried macaroni and an entire menu of fried candy bars
(The deep-fried Twinkies are like sugar explosions in your mouth
) If fried food isn't your thing, try the bangers and mash, two plump, seasoned sausages and smooth creamy mash, or the hearty shepherd's pie
The staff's welcome sense of humor makes ordering the Spotted Dick, a scrumptious sponge pudding dotted with raisins, an easy affair
the best pub food and drink in NYC hands down
the mac cheese is as good as the fish chips
the beer selection is top notch
the waitress is always fast and careful
i cant recommend this place any higher
Been here 3 times now I like it better than the Park Slope location
The staff here is friendlier and the ambience is much better
The fried cod chips is perfection and everything is authentic
Try anything fried with chocolate--not only is it unusual, but it is well worth the calories
It's definately a taste adventure!
We have been waiting for this place to open for some time (the Park Slope one is great but this one is closer) and it did not disappoint
Overall the food is the same (the Haddock and chips are perfect) but the space is nicer, the staff is friendlier and the mushy peas taste right (which is important! the slope ones were a little too atomic green and flavorless ) My boyfriend is a Brit and everything - particularly the steak and kidney pie - passed the authenticity test as well
It's a great value and a lot of fun and I am truly glad that this joint is still a good 10 blocks away otherwise I would be a million pounds
After coming here 5 times in a week, I may need to take a month off to let my arteries recover, but otherwise I'm thrilled to have it in the neighborhood
Besides having Tetley's and Belhaven on tap, the cod and chips are nearly perfect, as are the Fried Mars' bars and Fried Reeses Peanut Butter Cups
Stay away from the fried twinkies unless you really love twinkies -- the chocolate is much better
Really good though, and reasonable too
The Scene A long, sake-lined bar, back-lit with a red glow, leads into a bright middle room, dominated by an even longer sushi bar framed with a Pollock-esque design
Tucked behind the bamboo fountain is a sexier nook, outfitted with shoju-screen windows and dark wood details
The Food There's more here than top-quality sushi and sashimi, like sugar-coated foie gras with cashews and balsamic ginger sauce
Lightly fried rock shrimp and squid are teasingly touched with a creamy chile sauce, a slippery miso cod is satisfyingly silky, and a lamb brushed with wasabi blends spice and earth
The Mont Blanc dessert, a frothy combo of vanilla ice cream and pudding dotted with red bean and chestnuts, stands out more for its texture than flavor
The duo of crme brulee-vanilla and green tea, served with caramel ice cream is a notable finish
Went here last night for a late night snack
Was really excited about the small plates concept but ended up disappointed by the food
Soy chicken was too tough and better, fresher sashimi can be found elsewhere
GO HERE FOR THE DRINKS! Sake flight! Sake Sangria!
This place is absotely the best place to go for drinks
They have a sake sangria with many fruits, yuzu margarita,lemongrass margarita,sake martini, AND if you ASK, a bartender can make a special drink for you!!! trust me!! He makes the best drinks ever!!! he uses many fruits for making drinks
please stop by, and try it!! I am sure that you will love it!!
4 of us were looking forward to this meal for weeks
Ordered the mixed yakitori skewers -overcooked and bland
Ordered the sashimi -toro belly, salmon, scallops and yellowtail -fresh and flavorful
And also ordered the Red Dragon Roll and the Fois Gras roll-very disappointed
Decided to order 2 hot appetizers -they never showed up as the restaurant became overwhelmed with people and food orders
So we cut our losses at $200 and caught a cab to grab another meal! Wouldn't recommend the hot food-do not subject yourself to sub par food
This is probably the best place in the city to meet up with friends and spend the rest of the night chatting away, while tasting amazing food and sake
It's so good that I'm hesitating about sharing it with too many people
Once the words get out, I know it will be hard to get the tables
I love this place in my neighborhood
Please don't share it with the tourists
A couple of friends and I went on a Friday
The appetizers are great and the ambience is great as well
The food was excellent
Both of my friends absolutely loved it
The sushi was exquisite and very fresh
OUr waiter was so sweet
Quite expensive but worth the mula
TRy the tiramisu desert, your mouth will water
Thanks to my friends for letting me in on this special secret
Everything was absolutely perfect, from the uncrowded dining area, unique decor, impeccable/friendly service, and of course the incredible food

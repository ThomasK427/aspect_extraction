I had halibut which was crisped to perfection above a salad of heirloom tomatoes and green and white beans
Superb
Cocktails were also great and the peanut butter parfait dessert is not to be missed
The artichoke salad was also excellent, though it had a suspiciously 'cheeto'-like after taste
other than that, I have a new favorite restaurant!
I've eaten here 4 times and its been great every time
No bread problems, the service is always very friendly and the food is amazing (especially for the price)
My one comment would be the wine price per glass, which is high, but the bottle prices arent bad
One of the top 5 restaurants in Brooklyn
I didn't really know what to expect from the the Dressler
i have been going to Dumont for years, and i am a huge fan of the good food and relaxed atmosphere
So when i walked in i was just blown away by the lighting, flowers, wood and iron work, a reservationist, and a full bar
it's gorgeous
Taking everything good about Dumont, making it better and a touch more upscale
Other than the bread, which was stale (the manager told us they were having trouble with the bakery), we were thoroughly impressed
We especially like the crispy artichoke and white bean salad (you will think the artichoke are fried potatoes)
The free form ravioli was inventive, the sauce being the best part
Wine is good but a bit pricey for Brooklyn
They seem to be banking on the fact that there will be some overflow from Peter Luger'sand I fear they may be right
Eat here before all the Manhattanites discover it
A very cosy inexpensive place with great indian fast food
Best vada pav,mango lassi Pav Bhaji
Cafe Condesa's atmosphere is warm and welcoming just like the omni-present owners and the cute servers
All who work at this gourmet (but cheap!) little cafe are friendly and knowledgeable about the wine and fine food that they serve
The fettucine with brocolli rabe and the salmon are some favorite dishes of mine
The wine list is well priced and varied and includes a great pinot noir- the perfect light red wine for these hot august nights
So, yes, this place is fabulous- a must try! you'll go once and keep going back
it happened to me
In response to the previous review: THERE IS NOTHING LAME ABOUT CAFE CONDESA
The host is one of the owners and he is a sweetie!!!
i have to say i love love love this place
the crabmeat tortellini was a little lame and smothered in butter, but the cobb salad and the salmon are excellent! the wine is decent and the place overall is cute
the host is a retard and i can't stand him but i still go back for more
2 words to describe this great new addition to the WV: fresh unique
fresh dishes (LOVE the salmon in avacado puree/tomatillo sauce and LOVE the meatball with rice pilaf), uniquely reasonable prices and friendly service
Mano o Mano wine is superb
Sensory pleasure
Owners are a delight to be around
What a terrific place! The chef used to work with Bouley and it shows in the roasted brussel sprout leaves on the halibut; the slightly crisp roasted shiitake on the lamb chop; the freshly-diced avocado in the salad
All the dishes were delicious and all under $12
The chef and the 2 other owners were great and kindly offered us samples of port wine over ice and a dessert they're working on - earl grey-flavored creme brulee
Both were excellent
After a couple we met in a French/American restaurant recommended it, my boyfriend and I decided to go on a Thursday night
It's a great find, food was fresh and plentiful and it was not Chinesy Thai food
This is important to me, being Thai and knowing how real food in Thailand tastes; this place ranks up there in terms of authentic taste
They also played Thai instrumental music which added to the feel of a nice 'authentic' dining experience
My boyfriend ordered the panang green curry, which was served in a coconut shell and had young coconut meat in it- it was fragrant, not too heavy and moderately spicy
Very good
I had the Lard -Naa (broad rice noodles in thick sauce w/greens) and I was pleased with it as well
Service was attentive enough, although since we were the only people there -we went early around 6:30 - and only about 2 other parties came in after us, service could have been a little better
But no big deal, they gave us everything we needed
I'm definitely bringing my friends here
If you are in the Park Slope, Carroll Gardens area and you need some Thai, drop by!
Went recently when we found out it was a Bouterin restaurant (French chef who own Bouterin in the same neighborhood)
The waiter explained to us as we sat down that they were experiencing lots of problems so he apologized off the bat
The service was not great, but again, this had been explained to us
The food was good
Nothing to rave about, just good
We were waiting a long time to be served and waiting 20 mins to get our glasses of wine, and the owner saw that we were a bit displeased
He treated us to a dessert sampler on the house, which was also just good
I think this place will be much better once it has been open for a while, but my expectations were not met (they could have been too high though)
I came in to check this place out
I freind recommended it to me so I went in with my wife
WOW
Love the decor and the eats
They make a killer sangira
Where to begin
this little den is chock full of great wines, great dishes and a great staff
Theyre open late to eat or grab a drink and they even deliver! Personal favorites are the banana split, the tapas burgers and the white sangria
Keep Tuesday evenings open for the jazz jam (a can't-miss) and take in the warm atmosphere and smiles
the food here is terrible - but they try to make you think it is good - the management are all loosers - i highly reccomend never going there - i wish the place would close up already - i am sick of looking at its ugly windows signs DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!
Been to this location and it was wonderful, great atmosphere and great food, management and owners are wonderful, great place
will visit again
Very enjoyable
Quiet in the summer, with good streetside seating
The waitress was very sweet and the food was interesting and very good
A very hip restaurant in a somewhat quiet area
I've been popping into Zibetto (which is close to my office) when I need the occasional caffiene fix and it never disappoints
The star of Zibetto is the coffee: the espresso is perfectly prepared and is worlds better than anything you could get at your local Starbucks
The other menu options (cappuccino, macchiato, affogato - I'm sure I've spelled those wrong) are equally excellent - you can't go wrong here
Beyond the coffee, though, you get a terrific Italian-style atmosphere
It's a tiny hole-in-the-wall, and at peak times, you're elbow to elbow with more people than you'd probably like, but is kept immaculately clean, the service is quick, attentive and friendly
The baristas - and I've been served by three or four different ones, depending on time/day - are all top-notch at making coffee, and really good at light conversation, should you be in the mood to chat over your tiny little cup of espresso
Next time you decide you want to grab some coffee, walk past the Starbucks and go to Zibetto
Ideally, you'd take the ten minutes or so to enjoy your drink at the bar itself (although they are also nice enough to give you the drink to go, should you choose) and soak in the best espresso this side of Rome
I did not drink coffee for the 2 years I have been here until I found Zibetto
As good as, if not better than, a real Roma Cafe
Once you find Zibetto you will realize it was worth the search
There is no comparison in Manhattan let alone the US
Enjoy!
I recommend the Quatro (cold)
It's the closest thing to a kick in the pants that money can buy!!!!!  Zibetto bar is Zibettest espresso bar in NYC!!
Great espresso (including cappuccinos lattes with rosetta pours) with solid service, all be it with tons of Seinfeld 'soup N***'-like attitude
If you're at mid-town and need a caffeine fix this is a great place to go
(Attention to detail was noted - the barista pulled a second shot when the first was 'long' without being asked
A true artist and primadonna professional

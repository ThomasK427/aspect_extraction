Ok sweets
The guys who work there are nice as can be
The best pizza in the neighborhood by far
in the summer they have the best chocolate italian ice I've ever had
My 9 year old son, William, is a pizza afficionado and in the 8 years he has been living in New York he has sampled many a pizza in Manhattan and Brooklyn
He proclaims Luigi's pizza the best ever and me and my husband heartily agree
Thin, delicious crust, non-greasy, incredibly fresh toppings, Luigi gets it just right
This is a no-frills pizza parlour that serves up the real deal
The fresh mozzarella and basil is my personal favourite while my son and husband worship at the shrine of the regular slice
The secret may well be in Luigi's sauce-it may be in the crust-it may be in the freshness and quality of the cheese
Whatever-the formula works
Go
Now
Oh yes, and Adam Sandler has been there too
Some of the thinest and best crust we have had in Bklyn (over 20 yers), but the salt, geeze
chesse, sauce, not sure
My wife and I must have had a gallon of water a piece after dinner
If the salt factor is reduced, that Luigi's might be one of the best!
Sabella's is a great place if your looking to get a quick good slice
Don't get me wrong, this isn't by any means the best pizza I've had
On occassion it is slightly undercooked
However, $9 bucks for a large good tasting pie is a great deal
The atnosphere is very Brooklyn, an added bonus
You want something more upbeat head to Smiling Pizza on 7th Ave and 9th St
Totally disagree
Solid pizza, no frills atmosphere, good prices, and good guys if you take the time to chat them up
This is exactly what I want in a neighborhood pizza joint
the best broccoli pizza and spinach rolls I've ever eaten
SOME NOT ALL People who work here are friendly - if you can get past to the pizza guy who's not loud/rude or obnoxious it can be the greatest pizza brooklyn
Love the pizza here (although the slices aren't as fresh at 3am, but who's that picky when you're drunk), and there's plenty of other good stuff
Another plus is how friendly the guys are here at all times
Glad to have them in the neighborhood
obviously this is no grimaldes or something, it's pizza by the slice
but it's well above average for that
I live across the street from them, so I eat there quite a lot and I'm seldom disapointed
They are consistant and yummy 99% of the time
which is made more impressive by their hours: open till 3a on fri/sat, 2a mon-thu! (close at 11p sundays)
I would highly rate Smiling Pizza and claim that it is easily better than most run-of-the-mill pizza by the slice in and around the city
skip the frozen stuff and stop by smiling
for $1
55 / slice, you'll get the tastiest, most addictive pizza in the slope
i think it's something they put in the sauce
perfect for those late-night-just-got-off-the-F-train hunger pangs
the brocolli pizza is great
You wouldn't expect this neon-bright, commercial-looking joint right off the F train to have anything but a barely serviceable slice
Fortunately, you'd be wrong -- Smiling does one of the best pies in the neighborhood, and their rolls can't be beat
Not much ambiance, but hey, they're right on the way home, so who cares?
I moved from NYC some years ago
Manny's was our neighborhood pizza place and we were astonishingly lucky, as his Pizza was delicious and perfectly prepared
The place is always crowded with students during the day, but Manny always provides quick service to anyone who braves the crowd of youngsters
When I find myself missing my life in Brooklyn - and this is a common occurrence - Manny and his pizza shop always come to mind
Great local pizzeria
Generous portions on the entrees
Sausage Parmagiana with Linguine with a side of Garlic Knots is my favorite
Recommend calling first so you don't have to wait, since Manny makes everything to order
My fiance and I eat here way more than we should-----but it's so delicious!!! We've had pizza everywhere, but this? This pizza is heaven sent
Love, love, love
OMG, this place has got to be the best pizza place i've EVER been to!!!!!! It's GREAT! The food is AMAZING, they're SOOOOOOOOOOO friendly there, they'll just joke with u while ur ordering, and for me at least, it great 'cause i live REALLY close by to it! And its not like a pizza hut or a fast food place, it a REAL pizza place!!!!!!!!
these guys know how to make good pizza
try the stuffed pizzas, the calzones, and the garlic knots too! the guys behind the counter are super-friendly and get you your pizza in no time
Flower your taste bud with any item on the menu and you will not regret it ! Good spice but all moderate spiciness
Friendly staff
I had the baked linguini primavera! it was amazing
great food! good service and atmosphere
Love their toasted bagel sandwiches
So tasty!! If you're in the area, pop in
You won't be disappointed
These bagels are SO soft, and SO good
They also keep really well, so if your eyes are bigger than your stomach like mine and you buy eighty and eat one, you're in the clear
Also be sure to try all the tofu spreads
best for hungover sunday mornings
great tasting bagels
delicious egg and cheese sandwhiches
i've never been a huge bagel guy, and i'm not sure these are the best, but i see no reason to go looking elsewhere for one
I've been there 3 times, for their infamous $5 menu
The Mac n' Cheese is okay, and tastes packaged, however the sandwiches and salads are quite nice
The $5 menu does have smaller portions, and I found the ravioli dish to be not too much better than a can of Chef Boyardee
The service isn't that great; I've waited 20 minutes for a glass of water
But it's a decent place to dine
just don't do it on your lunch break
I happened at this place by accident and fell in love with it
In addition to a great music selection and great lighting the food way stupendous
The yams were just like mom's and the chocolate martini was just perfect
The $5 Lunch menu is an awesome deal
For $5, you have a choice of hot sanwiches or even jerk chicken for example, as well as killer sides! You also get curteous quick service, and a quiet atmosphere
You're not gonna get gourmet, but you will walk away full and ready to finish the day!
I used to love Brooklyn Moon
It used to be a nice place for cheap eats with friends
Now the portions are smaller and the newly added wait staff is slower than slow
I am so disappointed
We come here once a weekend since moving to BK and we love it!   Recommendations: The french toast, pancakes, Western omlette, the burgers and the strawberry shake! YUMMY!!!   Cons: Please be aware that it can be crowded on the weekends
The wait is normally minimal but worth it
A couple of the waiters could use some attentiveness training
Pros: Great food at a REASONABLE price espically for Park Slope
Great ambience; its your neighborhood cafe where they recognize you
The owner is the biggest jerk in the restaurant business
For brunch on Saturday, I wanted to sit down and order coffee and toast while waiting for my girlfriend to arrive
The owner told me I couldn't sit down, I'd have to wait outside because she wasn't there yet
I protested
I told him I'm planning on ordering food, and he said, I don't care, then I said that's stupid and unreasonable, so he replied by saying, you're stupid, and don't tell me how to run my restaurant

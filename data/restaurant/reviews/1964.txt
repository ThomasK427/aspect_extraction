The service was so friendly we felt like they were part of our party! Definitely check it out!
A nice meal in city! Reasonable priced and very good service
We enjoyed it and will be back
We called a day ahead and made a lunch reservation for 10 people for our friend's birthday
When we got there, we were told by the waitstaff that the room where our party was to be seated was unavailable due to a photo shoot going on there, and that they couldn't seat us
When we expressed our dissatisfaction, they said we're just waitstaff and didn't get a manager or even offer an apology
At that point, we were very happy to go somewhere else down the block because of the rude treatment we received
I, for one, have no intention of going back; I've gotten better treatment at McDonalds for crying out loud!
This is one of those places where it would be perfect, if only they could get their act together! This place is so cute, with great ambiance and great food but the service sucks
And we were the only people there!
Though an out of towner, I am in NYC quite frequently, and encounter mostly fantastic service
This was not the case at Yaffa's; we were made to wait an unreasonable amount of time in an otherwise empty restaurant--then chided for our impatience by a waitress who proceeded to shoot dirty looks at us, despite not even being OUR waitress
The food was merely okay, but not worth the price, the wait, or the attitude
Nice decoupage on the tables, but not nice enough to convince me or my friends to return
had visitors in from out of town, 6 of us turned up at 10pm Sat night - the Brazilian waiter could not have been more courteous
Wonderful choice of eclectic foods - tasting even better than it sounded
Great atmosphere setting
Everyone went away with a good recommendation for where to meet in Tribeca
We waited 15 minutes for a menu, another 20 for a tea, another 15 for an appetizer, then when the plates came out, the waitress had to ask me what I'd ordered
Mine came out when everyone was finished, and was cold
After a $3 tip on a $51 bill, the Coyote Ugly-reject manager approached us, condescending to us over how In AMERICA we tip 15%
We ARE American, you pompous twit
Good service though, is universal
Stopped in to get a little something to stave off my hunger
Waitresses were friendly
the tapas were delicious (beets, mushrooms, and fried calamari)
I'm a thai myself, I didn't like the food at all, the service is also not good, I know it's busy but they should have hired better manner and service minded staff
Not very well known, perhaps due to its location (right near the mouth of the Holland Tunnel), but in my humble opinion this little restaurant offers the best Thai food in New York
The quality of the food is excellent- my personal favorite dishes are the Pad Thai and the House Curry
The service is fast and very friendly- the waiters consistantly refill your water, they give you the option of how spicy you want your food to be, and the head waiter always comes to your table to ask how things are and if you are enjoying the food
I highly recommend Thai House to everyone I know who enjoys Thai food!
This place is sooo good i LOVE it
Actually the other dishes aren't so great its only the pad thai
soo good
Thai House Cafe is a wonderful and charming restaurant that has extremely attentive and friendly service, lots of options for vegetarians and great prices
I defintely plan on going back many times and have already written my friends and told them about this place
I LOVE this place! It's a great little hole in the wall where you can get authentic Thai food
My favorite is the Yellow Curry with Roast Duck
and my boyfriend's favorite is the Chu-Chi Curry with Chicken
The best part is that it's not that expensive! Located on the same block as the former Wetlands club, it's easily accesible by both subways and cabs
The staff is friendly, and the service is super-quick! Love it, Love it, Love it!
The Scene This unassuming northern Italian veteran is housed in a soaring ocher-toned loft, with giant sprays of flowers and wafer-thin sconces that cast diffused light
It's the kind of undemanding space that allows you to focus on the food, rather than the galactic design of a celebrity architect
The diffident but capable servers are a pleasant change from the in-your-face style so common downtown
The Food Tuscan-born Leonardo Polito, the chef and owner, is a traditionalist who seldom strays from his rustic roots--indeed, while a signature dish may go on sabbatical for a month or two, it reappears when customers start grumbling
Among them is a terrific salad with charred octopus glazed with balsamic vinegar, a light and toothsome artichoke lasagna and Venetian fish soup built on a sturdy seafood stock with clams, mussels and lobster
Polenta and gnocchi excel, too, in all of their variations
The decor will impress any hipster, and yet also cater to the romantic couple who want to enjoy a conversation without having to shout
My advice when it comes to the food is stick with the pasta which were all fabulous
The ravioli stuffed with eggplant, drizzled in a truffle/wine sauce was by far the winner
all the appetizers were enjoyable also, priced very fairly
This place is a true escape from the pretentiousness that is found in many nyc eateries
This is a place to enjoy a date, company, and great food in a relaxed setting
sorry singles, a small bar, = no bar scene, a good thing for this type of place
The Scene A first-come-first-served reservations policy makes Next Door Nobu a more accessible alternative to its more famous neighbor, where prime dinner seats are as hard to come by as decent tickets to "The Producers
" The interior sports the same Zen mountain retreat look as the original, plus a "nama" (Japanese for "raw") bar and a wall covered entirely in nori
The Food The menus at the two restaurants are almost entirely the same, and the food is of identical quality
Expect all the favorites: black cod sweetened with miso, yellowtail sashimi spiked with jalapeno and savory squid "pasta" with asparagus, plus epic-length omakase meals and the occasional Kobe beef special
I go to Next Door Nobu once a week because Nobu's restaurants have the best sushi of anywhere! The dishes are also amazing
Some of my favorites are the Miso Cod, Miso Eggplant, Creamy SpicyCrab, SteakTeriyaki (not on menu) and Sashimi Salad
Their service is incredible staff is extremely knowledgable about the menu
They don't accept reservations so if you go in and see emply tables and others going in being seated don't make the assumption that it's corrupt
If you arrive and there are no tables they will take your name and cell number
They tell you how long the wait is in my experience is on target
If you choose to leave they will call your cell phone when your table is ready
You have 15 minutes to get back to the restaurant before they give your table to the next person on the list
Next Door Nobu is outstanding for food, average for sushi
I would highly recommend the $120 tasting menu
The first time around, we had the $80 tasting menu, which included some sushi items, which I found to be pretty average, especially for the price
The $120 tasting menu the second time around however, did not contain any sushi and it was fantastic
You also feel full afterwards, as you get about 7 dishes plus 2 desserts
At restaurants like these, you should always go for the high-end tasting menus
My philosophy is: if you're going to an expensive restaurant, you might as well get the expensive items
It makes no sense to go to a pricey restaurant and only half-heartedly spend the money; you're going to feel ripped off if you do since you won't be getting the great dishes and still be spending a good amount in the end
The sushi is small and not tasty
The price is way too expensive: rice is $2
50 a bowl; salmon sushi is $5; uni sushi is $7
It takes quite a long time to get the food
The seating is quite crowded and not comfortable, although we don't have to wait
Service is OK
The best is the dishes from the kitchen
The price is about $18-25
The size is very small and it definitely cannot fill you up
I don't recommend you to go for the sushi
Sharaku's sushi is much much better
We stopped by NND on a Tuesday night for dinner on gf's birthday and felt completely fleeced (in the way you feel after buying a $12 hotdog)
First off, they have packed so many tables into the space that you are sitting elbow to elbow with complete strangers
The service was barely sufficient but not attentive
As for the much vaunted food, we had the raw bar, which was fresh and good, but for $35, could've contained more pieces
Cod liver pate with caviar was poorly done and tasteless
Halibut cheeks with asparagus, mushrooms and wasabi sauce was okay, if extremely salty
Finally, the black cod with miso was very good
If this place was the neighborhood Japanese at $30 a head I would not go back
But for $70 a head, I have to question whether it's merely another NY tourist trap
We were given a table immediately, on a tuesday night of august at 10pm
We chose the tasting menu (omakase) at 120
The rations were small but numerous
The first raw fishes were common, except for a medium-raw whitefish
The black cod with its foie gras was incredible, and the Kobe beef excellent
The sushi were great

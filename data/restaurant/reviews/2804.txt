New management in its attempt to modernize has essentially turned this place into a second rate PF Chang's
The Chinese menu is gone, along with most of the good dishes
The wait staff while attentive did nothing to address the hair that was found in one of our dishes
The rice that we were served for dinner was dry and hard, obviously left over from lunch
Maybe this is a transitional period but judging by the last two meals I've had there they are certainly headed in the wrong direction
Great food, especially in the given neighborhood
Compared to Manhattan, it's the best value outside the city
Let me tell you, my boyfriend and I can't get enough of this place, it's fantastic
the Sangria is sooo perfect, I can't have one glass, the Chicken is always moist and delicious served in a portion I have yet to ever completely finish
Whatever the green sauce is, I want to drown everything in it it's amazing and the avocado salad is a perfect compliment to the spice
Yes the service stinks and its cramped in there, expect a line of people standing against the wall waiting to pick up food behind you
but believe me, it's worth it
I'm all about ambiance when going out, but the food makes you want to go back again and again and again
best chicken in queens
period
also try their avacado salad
so good!!  they have another place on 1nd ave and 90
great place as well
awesome sangria!! i love pio
Do yourself a favor if you ever find yourself in Rego Park and hit up Avellino's Pizza
the pizza is a no-brainer, and the dinners are drastically underrated
Try the lasagna (a personal favorite), the carbonara or the parm
all delightful and reasonably priced
Great wait staff as well
if you play your cards right you may end up with a free glass of wine or 5
With the first bite of Avellino's uniquely-tangy pizza, the tastebuds seem to sing with the discovery of one of the best pies in the five boroughs
The crust is a work of art, the proportion of cheese to sauce is almost scientific in its perfection, and what heavenly sauce, with a tang that puts every other pizzeria in a five-mile radius to shame! It's obvious why Avellino's has ruled Rego Park as the premiere pizzeria for over twenty years!
Turkey burger here! and the best, if I may add
All their food is of quality
Sometimes there is a wait, but their food is made to order, so it is o
k
if you ask me
If I am not eating in this diner, I am home ordering delivery service from them
I love diners, but I REALLY love this one
Must try!
I looovvvee omellettes but this is not the place to have one
Their waffles are really good though
Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside
All of their servers are very friendly as well
I recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and looking for a good diner
The food was awesome if you can deal with wait staff who you can hardly ever find
It took us 2
5 hours to get our food and eat it and another 45 minutes to get the check and get out
Table arrangement was very cramped
I had thrown a party here a few months ago
For the price I paid per person, the value was exceptional
One of the people at the party was so thrilled about the place, they made arrangements to speak to the manager to book their own party!! The food is great and everyone was very attentive
I am actually going to dinner there tonight!!! I would reccommend this place for any event; romantic evening, out w/ the kids, group gathering, out-of-towners
anyone!
Lenny's has been around for a LONG time
It's been good for a LONG time
Now, with the maturing pallet of NYers, its nice to see that they are incorporating some new tastes into their menu
Wasabi/Ginger reductions, Jicma Slaw with citrus chili sauce, etc make for new twists on some old favorites
The fish is still tremendously fresh and is for retail sale if desired
The service is not quite City quality, but then again you're at Lenny's because you don't want City service
Prices are reasonable, but can get high with drinks and dessert
Otherwise, Lenny's is still a great dinner spot with me and my family
So I was looking for a quality eat in the Rego Park area after nine and didn't feel like a bar
We popped into this place 25 minutes before they closed and they served us with a smile! The food was fast and sooo yummy! The portions are not gigantic, but with the fresh bread and side of colesalw, I left feeling satisfied
I would definately recommend this place for a small celebration, with the high prices this is probably not an everday kind of place
Menu was full of fresh and classic seafood choices - something here for everyone!
Worth the trip! Easy to get to, click the map and get directions
about 4 miles from manhattan
The fish, the amazing fresh fish is so fresh, and so good
This is a classic, fish restaurant
The prices are not cheap, but it;s all worth it for the quality of food you get
This place doesn't get it
Our food took an hour and a half to deliver and was cold
The portions were small enough for a mouse and what value
Did I mention this place sucks!!!!
I would never buy food from them again
I ordered white rice, beans, chicken and sweet plaintains to go
When the food arrived the bag looked half empty
After confirming with the waiter of what I order and what was in the bag, he noticed that yes, we were missing the sweet plaintains
He returned with the plaintains and gave us our food
The food was horrible
The rice was hard (undercooked), there were no beans, the chicken was horrible it was cold and had yellow clumps of fat all over it (disgusting), obviously it was not cleaned and the sweet plaintains were burnt
The dinner special is amazing, although I would pick the meat option rather than seafood
You get several courses, and enough food to feed two or even three
But order enough to take some home! I haven't had anything I didn't like here
The food is authentic, and the service always attentive
The decor is nice although I suppose the place could use a little renovation
This restaurant is in Rego Park, not Flushing
Parking is not the most convenient, but it's not even one block from the subway at 63rd Dr
Def the best indian resteraunt in Queens, even worth checking out if you're in the city
Service, atmosphere, and most importantly, TASTE !!!!!!!!! Not too expensive either
I can't say one negative thing about this place
The food is amazing, the ambience is fantastic, the service is attentive, and the prices are outstanding
The best Indian food I've ever had hands down, at a fantastic best price
This place used to be Korean-owned and might still be
Haven't been there in years but they used to make the best bagels and delights--bagels flattened out before baking to produce a large, flat, crusty-chewy product groeat for heaping mounds of cream cheese, smoked fish, and veggies on
they have bagels in at least a dozen varieties
pumpernickle, onion, sesame seed, etc
my personal favorite is sesame seed bagel with tuna salad
service is speedy and rushed, try to avoid the lunch crowd by coming before 12 or after 3
The bagel gets more pricey as you put more on it, but I've never paid more than 4 dollars
While not a cafe in the Starbucks sense, this gem of a bakery outclasses most 212 bakeries
I have been none to get on the train from Manhattan to their chocolate and orange muffins that are tender on the outside and sweet and moist on the inside
Most Fabulous Muffins I've ever had!
I notice this place is always crowded, but wonder why

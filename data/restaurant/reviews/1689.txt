I sat at the table while everyone ate
After their dishes were cleared away, I once again inquired about my food
It's coming was the snotty response
My food arrived as everyone was putting their coats on
I shoveled it down- it was ok, but certainly not worth the wait- and swore NEVER to go here again!
I had a 10 pm reservation for Il Bagatto on a Saturday night
Not only were they rude on the phone, the bartender ignored us during our entire TWO hour wait
When we asked about our chances for getting a table an hour and a half after arriving we were given some bread to tide us over--which we were later charged for
Finally sitting at midnight, we were rushed through the meal as they started mopping the floors around us
I would never reccommend this place to anyone
Although the food is good, with their attitude its a wonder they can stay in business
In a neighborhood where good Italian food is on every corner, this place should be avoided at all costs
The staff is obnoxious and insensitive--the food is good but not good enough to compensate for such a lousy overall experience
Even though we were assured by the host it would be 30 minutes for a table, we waited over an hour to be seated
One waiter serviced the entire floor, so even though we were starving, it took another 20 minutes just to hear the specials
Forget having your water refilled
Or even your glass of wine, for that matter
I want those 3 hours of my life back, and the $100
The problem with Il Bagatto is not the management, but the customers
This would be a charming, romantic find of a place, but the over-hype it has gotten on the internet makes it unbearibly crowded
I don't understand why upper-eastsiders insist on venturing down here
All they do is complain about seating and bread
Stay in your own neighborhood
Go to Tony's on 2nd Ave; they will fill you up
and quick
The food and atmosphere is great
I had a reservation for a Staurday night and after a 1 hour and 45 minute wait, we still were not seated!! Totally ridiculous - we left, and I haven't been back since
AVOID THESE RESTAURANTS - THEY WILL NOT LAST These comments pertain to ILL Bagatto and it's sister restaurant next door:  * Arrogant, obnoxious host(s) * If I want bread, and/or cheese with seafood pasta, bring me the damn cheese!  * Sister restaurant: we went on a Friday night (only half empty restaurant on this block), and the host scolded us and told us to wait outside
HE WOULD NOT LET US ORDER DRINKS WHILE WE SAT AT THE BAR!  There is a reason they are half empty, and it's not the food
Normally, I would damn the host to the depths of hell for eternity, but clearly he's been there and is simply back to give us a status report
The food here is excellent, but the service and the proximity of other tables takes a lot away from it
Not only are the upstairs tables right on top of each other, but attempting to score a table for more than 4 people is next to impossible
Even downstairs, the waitresses ask you to give up your table soon after you are done eating even if you were planning to stay to continue drinking
This is a restaurant that would be superb if the staff would just relax a bit
I have been to this restaurant about 5 times now over a span of 4 years and it only gets better
I would have agreed 3 years ago that the service leaves a bit to be desired but I went there a couple months ago twice in two weeks and both times it was amazing
The food is always great
The standard menu has some greats, but even better is the fact that they always have at least 4 to 5 specials which always have something amazing
The last two times I went I took about 8 friends and not one had a bad thing to say
You may have to wait a while for a table, but get a drink in their funky bar downstairs
I was a little nervous to make a reservation for New Years here, because of what everyone said on Citysearch
But they were wrong, wrong wrong! We had a wonderful experience! The food was fresh and delicious and reasonably priced, the waitress was perky and friendly and very helpful, and the owner thanked us for coming as we left
A great restraurant, very romantic and not too pricey
Great wine list
This should be rated an 8 or a 9, but being that reservations dont mean anything here
Dont expect to be seated within 45 minutes of your actual reservation, but the food is great, especially for its price and the ambience is awesome
I was very excited about this new discovery but each time the place became worse
No bread allowed before the entree nor as an appetizer
No cheese on my pasta - PaaaLEASE spare me, this is hardly an upscale restaurant
Waited 1hr and a half for a table to be told to finish up after only 1 hr! They refused to accomodate by finding an area downstairs for us to finish
The owner was shockingly rude and unsympathetic
A time limit was not posted or mentioned
The owner just decided that our needed table for two was more important than our future business
I was extremely disappointed and downright pissed enough to post this review
There are so many adorable, cheap restaurants in NYC there is no reason ever to give this establishment business
Thanks for reading this
Il Bagatto is a wonderful restaurant and very unique to New York
Take out of town friends here
They will love it
Personally, I don't have a problem with the owner refusing cheese on seafood pasta
Who, beyond the age of 10 puts cheese on a dish anyway? Okay maybe on certain dishes in certain restaurants, but not here
You know what? The customer is not always right, not from my experience anyway
The best way to enjoy Il Bagatto is to take it as it comes and enjoy the unique aspects of the place
Don't try to force your expectations on a successful restaurant, you just look like an idiot
Complaining loudly about things will only ruin the experience for you
Sit back, enjoy the food, have some wine, RELAX
Self-important people, please stay at home and cook and dump as much parmesan on as you like
You can't go wrong here
Although you'll certainly have to wait in the basement bar for 15-30 minutes (even with a reservation), the people are friendly and the food is amazing
The relatively simple pasta arabiatta and gnocci gorgonzola are solid choices, and the specials are always super
And a great bang for your buck, considering neighborhood prices these days
And it's nearly as good delivered
But be warned: cash only
The rustic brick coupled with the branches across the ceiling gives Il Bagatto the feeling of an Italian courtyard without having the endure the Autumnal New York chills
A reservation did not save us from a wait at the bar, but the food was worth it; a grilled calamari appetizier with mushrooms was delicious as was a mixed seafood pasta main course
Indeed, there wasn't a bad thing on the menu, though the ricotta cheese-cake was a little light and fluffy after being brought up on a diet of Juniors
Service was good, the bill even better
Listen, if you want to go here, just don't ask for cheese on any seafood dish! it just doesn't happen here! accept it or go elsewhere
i've been going there for years and that's how it's always been
the wait is a bit unpredictable because of it's size and all
you can't rush people out
just get some drinks downstairs or at their wine bar next door first!
the food is good
i recommend the grilled calamari,penne arrabiata,ravioli in the butter sage sauce, and the pannacotta with bosco di friutti? anyway
it's the east village
laid back
relax
don't go if you're in a rush and have to eat within a time-frame
I was introduced to this wonderful restaurant by a friend who said the food is excellent for the prices
I couldn't agree more
I usually order the penne arrabiatta and it is spicy and just the right size and delicious
A carafe of wine is also very inexpensive
I have had only good experiences with the host, who once seated my boyfriend and me promptly, after we arrived 20 minutes after the rest of our party
A romantic setting also with the little lights hung from the ceiling from branches
When I go out for dinner which is quite often, I have never encountered such rudeness from a waiter or owner as I did at this smoke filled, tight spaced, cash only restaurant
The owner acts as if its a priviledge to eat at his restaurant rather than giving good service
Call for reservations??? I don't think so
Don't think if you call for reservations they will be honered
The food is cheap because of the size of the portions
At this restaurant there are no changes to what you order everything is as is on the menu

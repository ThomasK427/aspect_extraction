Also, this building used to be a church and the stained glass windows are beautiful
We stopped at Johns before going to the 3:00 PM Matinee on 12-15-02
When arrrived just before noon and we were told that the wait would be 20 minutes
We sat at the bar ordered drinks and were seated within 10 mnutes
We were a party of 9, with 4 kids
We had the Calinmari and salads for starters
Calimari was fresh, light, delicious
Salads will feed 2 per
Ordered 3 pies
I white 2 regular and they were awesome
White pie was a bit bland, but not worth compalining about
Ordered a 4th pie and as such managed to put away 30 slices for 9 people
The staff was attentive and very very pleasant
The prices were very reasonable
4 pies, salads, appetizers and cocktails for $150
00, tip included
When we left, there was a huge wait, so we timed it right
Very Highly recommended
It's refreshing to be able to grab a group of people to see a show on Broadway and know that some of the best pizza I've encountered is an easy walk from any of the major attractions
I would not hesitate to recommend John's Pizzeria, and I'd find their prices quite affordable when you split a pizza with some friends
Overall a fine restaurant
I'm not a big fan or thin crust pizza, but I found this pizza to be excellent
I also had the baked ziti and that was pretty good too
The best part is the atmosphere
It looks much nicer on the inside and the wait staff are very helpful and quick
Picked this resturant by chance
Fabulous atmosphere, great service, excellent food
Did not have the Pizza
Desserts were excellent and different
Not overpriced
From New Jersey
Would choose this as a regular place to eat
For a long time dinner prospects around Time Square were depressing, unless you wanted to drop big bucks
The situation has improved, but nothing really beats John's - the pizza is fresh and amazingly good (don't miss the fresh basil version) and the place is big enough to seat and serve you quickly
For pre-theatre, it's hard to beat
In Short Since first opening in 1955 in Des Plaines, Ill
, McDonald's has become one of the most recognized brands in the world
Casual and kid-friendly, the red-and-gold colored restaurants offer quick drive-thru or dine-in service with a menu of burgers, sandwiches and more
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast
McDonald's - who could not love it except the jaded elitists who wish to believe they are chosen to be unique? I travel all over the City and I always seek out Mickey D's for a truly enjoyable value
Go march in a demonstration in Midtown, stop in at the Times Square McDonald's and enjoy!
How does a McD's burger get such a high score
Has somebody who has a vested interest post that score/review
I don't care which Mcdonalds, they all have the same beef/methods of making that burger, please don't trust these reviews
People be aware of idiots, they're out there
McDonalds one of the best hambugers in NY
Those hamburgers taste the same when I was a kid in the 60's
They have not done anything to make them even close to a good hamburger
Even there so call fries are lousy when they are not out of the oil
That last review reads like a paid promotional announcement from McDonalds Corporate
McD's has no business being on this list of the best hamburger joints in NYC, or anywhere else for that matter
For a cheap quick bite, sure; but in the same league as some of the best restaurants in the city? I don't think so!

McDonald's is GREAT
Same value, same taste anywhere in the world
If you're American you have to love it! I do
Why is anyone even rating Mcdonald's, for crying out loud!!!! It is what it is
not even worth a review! Although, I will admit, Quarter pounder's ROCK!!!!!
I am always surprised with the favor bestowed upon McDonald's
Unfortunately, America's eating habits have become more of a habit than a genuine pleasure
Given the vast array of outstanding ethnic restaurants in NYC why do we seem to choose mediocrity over true gastronomical pleasure?
McDonald's is cheap and a great place to eat when in a hurry! Great menu and great snacks for all ages!
McDonald's is known for it's consistency
Any McDonald's you go to, you have an idea what the flavor will be
As far as atmosphere, this McDonald's differs from all others
Go upstairs for an appealing atomosphere that the kids will love
I'm not a big Mickey D's fan
don't eat it as much as I did when I was a kid
but if you have to visit 1 McDonald's make it this one
It's right in the heart of Times Square, the crossroads of the world
so order up a Big Mac Value meal try to get a seat near the window and watch the world go by
for once McDonald's gets ir right
In Short Planning a special date? Looking to inject a little bit of romance into a relationship? One could do far worse than this three-hour jaunt out on the Hudson
The menu lists a self-consciously luxe lineup of dishes conceived by some of the city's finest chefs, including brandy-stoked lobster bisque, filet mignon with thyme-scented potatoes, autumn vegetables with an ancho chili pepper sauce and desserts from Payard Patisserie
Yes, the weather was slightly rough, but the ship was never tossed! ;-)  The food was AMAZING
Their new chef should get a medal
My girlfriend and I have never eaten so well
The only fault would be that we spent more time admiring/eating the food then admiring/taking pictures of the Statue of Liberty and the Skyline
The servers were polite and oh so efficient
While we never made any odd requests, I feel they would have bent over backwards to accomadate most anything
The dinner cruise was one of the very best ways to see the sights of Manhattan at night, including the Statue of Liberty all lit up
We sailed on The Princess, and the ship was nice all things considered, but the dance floor was a bit too small for the number of passengers
The food was good but nothing to write home about - the rack of lamb was a bit too fatty
We opted for the Ambassador service upgrade which included the caviar and champagne and upgraded seating - for an additional $35 a person on a special night it's worth it
All-in-all we spent just over $300 for the two of us, but it was WELL worth it for the memories (and the photo ops)
Food is very mediocre, prepared en masse and delivered the same way, insuring that our crab cakes and filet mignon came out at room temperature
For filet, it was surprisingly flavorless
Wine list is generic, with the most expensive bottle of Margaux coming in at $69
No vintage years on the menu, you'll have to ask
Server was very pleasant but obviously overworked, so we waited for wine, waited for bread, waited for dessert
DJ played Sailing when we departed, which was nice n' tacky
Music was mostly unobtrusive though
Ultimately, you take this cruise for the cruise itself
Go in with that mindset and you won't be disappointed
Despite the chef-designed menu, the food is pretty average

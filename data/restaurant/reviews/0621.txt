There are plenty of other places in the city where our business will be appreciated and we will not be returning to Kitchen 22
I use to love ALVA - nicest bar staff in NYC great crowd of locals - now it is a scene full of those Park Ave girlies swishing their downmarket apple martini's - the barstaff is still the same thank god with some lovely new additions - I'll keep going back as they still make one of the best NY martinis - also ask one of the staff to make you a Sweet Caroline - not on the menu but an old ALVA special for those of us in the know!!!  (service score rates the bar not the restaurant which gets a 2)
Formulaic, bland and unappealing
All the dishes seem systematically cranked out and then seem to sit under the salamander for too long
There are so many delicious prix-fixes in the city, why waste your $25 here?
A pretty good restaurant, great value for the price, with good food ambience
They don't always have everything, but that's a testament to its intstant popularity
Nice bar decor
Great for small groups
A lot of fun
This place bills itself as a great value, which for three courses for $25
00 I really cant argue with, however, the service stunk with a capital S
I spent more time looking for a waiter than I did enjoying my meal
I think I would rather pay a little more just to get the better service
Food = well you get what you pay for
The food was great! Excellent combinations of flavors, and superbly presented, especially for $25 for 3 courses! The best value in the city
Service was acceptable, and we got in early enough not to have to wait (6:45)
$7
50 martinis
$7 glass wine
Great value all around
Food is pretty good, but probably not worth the 2 hour wait on a friday night
Plus, drinks are really expensive so that when all is said and done, the $25 pre-fixe is not such a great deal
I love Aureole, but what happened to this restaurant? The food was bland and uninspiring
The tuna appetizer was one of the worst tuna dishes I've had at any restaurant
Why would one pair mashed potatoes with a sushi grade of tuna? The steak was undercooked and was not seasoned
The frites that accompanied the steak were severely undercooked
The desserts appeared to be a mishmash of god knows what
Only the chocolate pudding was halfway decent
Pay a little extra and do the $68 prix fixe at Aureole
I've been here twice and had great meals--by the way-it's a choice of five appetizers, mains, and desserts---I wish they took reservations though--and I agree with the other review that SOMEONE has to answer the phone! The food, though, is GREAT--fresh, and beautifully presented--I've had the halibut and steak, and the corn chowder was the best I've had all summer
The service should be better, but it's still the best deal in town
Not only did the waiter mess up my order (Only 4 things to choose from) but they were SLLLLOOOOWWWW
I merely asked for the steak and they gave me the salmon?????? We sat down and didn't get served for an hour and a half
I would recommend saving 25 dollars and go ANYWHERE !!!
Excited to try a promising new local place , we called first to get a rough idea of what the wait was only to be greeted by an annoying message with absolutely NO WAY TO GET THROUGH TO A HUMAN, so we had to just take our chances
Upon arrival, the rather bitchy hostess told us that there would be a wait of about an hour (fine, but it would have been nice to ascertain this beforehand), but that they would be closing at 10:30 anyway so don't bother waiting
I commented that both the website and the phone message indicated that they were open from 5-11
The hostess condescendingly assured us that the website and phone message were wrong
We moved on to enjoy one of the many more reliable neighborhood eateries
High expectations shattered by poor management
Another dud of a restaurant in the making
The reviews here are a bit harsh on the staff
the restaurant just opened, after all
The food is well worth the money, 3 courses for $25, you can't really go wrong, and the portion sizes are decent
not ample, but decent
The beef carpaccio was lovely
Great place to go if you live in the neighborhood, not exactly something I'd make as a night out
You'd think that the wait would end once you actually get a table, but
NOT! It took forever to place our order
when my soup came, no one bothered to give me a spoon until i asked for it
It gets better
the waitress came to ask me how my NY Strip was, and I could not give her an answer b/c no one gave me a steak knife
(um, hello! This is NOT medieval times, you know)
The table next to us had the EXACT same situation
For $25, you get a good amount of pretty decent food
no doubt about it
But the service REALLY sucks
We went there last night and absolutely loved it
The quick seared salmon appetizer was great
The Halibut was delicious and my apple tart was excellent
The servers were very friendly and helpful
plus we were understanding since it was their first official night open
Even though dinner is a great deal -- watch out for the bar -- the drinks will double your bill
Great!
The food was average, the service was worse
This is a new restaurant, but have the servers at least try the main dishes so they can offer a decent recommendation
Until they get their act together, I would not recommend this restaurant
You'd be better off making the same dishes at home
Went there last night and was absolutely blown away with how incredible the food was
The seared tuna appetizer was definitely one of the best things I've ever had
And the $25 price fix for appetizer, entree and dessert is the best deal around
I was a long time patron at Il Bigatto, but have found my new favorite Italian spot in the East Village
The foods just as good, if not better and you never have an hour wait for your table
The hosts are warm and friendly, the servers hang on your every whim
Defintely the new authentic Italian restaurant of the East Village
My friends and I have by far found our home away from home at Sciue' Sciue'
From the moment you enter to the moment you leave you will be doted upon, entertained, be stuffed by wonderful authentic Italian food and instantly become friends with Angelo or Marco who are the co-owners
You will always hear Italian spoken by the staff and the always present Italians at the bar and eating
Sciue' Sciue' is our place to relax, drink lots of Chianti, and pretend that we are once more back in Italy as we pathetically speak to Angelo in Italian
I was almost turned off by the atmosphere thinking it was a little too kitschy, but if you ignore the space decorations and emphasis on hemp the food is quite good and makes vegetarians and edgy omnivores quite happy
Would recommend that they keep up with the great food but tone down the out of this world atmosphere
The food speaks for itself and makes people happy enough
Would love to go back and try many of the items on the menu, but the tandoori flavored salmon with coconut quinoa was divine
Diner remade into a hip space theme without being over the top
Drinks available
Healthy, creative menu at very affordable prices; I appreciated lots of vegetarian choices, yet my carnivorous friends loved it too
I'll be back
I really enjoy eating at Galaxy
Its low-light and has a 'chill' atmosphere
There's even stars on the ceiling for those who notice
The menu is very creative and unique
The food is delicious too, and the prices are pretty good for what you're getting
It's really one of the only places that I regularly go to
I highly recommend it and I take my friends there all the time
This place is an underrated treasure
If you cant find anything on the menu here to please your palette, you need help
The prices are low, the drinks are creative, the menu is both voluminous and eclectic as heck, and most importantly, she's open pretty much 24 hrs
Whats to complain about? I have met a couple of people that are freaked out about the menu, but they are uncultured and afraid to ever try something new, so I pity them
Sure some of the items on the menu are quite outlandish, but I am sure they have their fans

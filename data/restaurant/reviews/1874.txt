sometimes when we all go out to dinner - we just like to eat - drink good wine - and stuf ourselves with yummy snacks and juicy meats - with good company rude waiters are just fast and out of the way - who cares! americans are such babies
wanting to be served so polite - like they are at mommies house - enjoy yourself - eat - drink - il buco is like a pirate ship with awesome food - i love it!
How anyone could trash this beautiful restaurant with its outstanding menu and exquisite wine list is beyond me
By far the most romantic dinner I've ever had and some of the best food too
Try the pan-seared encrusted tuna appetizer and the panacotta desert- yum! Plus the olive oils are incredible, tasting as if they were pressed that afternoon
Just go
My fiance and I were dining at Il Buco to determine if it would be good for our reception
When we walked in, we were certain that this was the place
However, after waiting 20 minutes for our waiter to take our offer, we started to be less sure
When my fiance asked for a wine recommendation, the response was its your choice
The food clinched it
Nothing about it was bad, but nothing was good, either
This was not the place for a reception or even a return visit
s place could be romantic only it has communal seating! What is romantic about that? There are only 3 private tables in the entire restaurant
I have to say the service was amazing! My first experience at this restaurant was 2 days after the blackout so they didn't have a full menu (even though I called in advance and they told me they would)
I really didn't care for what I had
If I was to ever give this restaurant another chance it would definitely be with a group not a romantic evening
I like Il Buco
I think the food is good, the ambience charming and it offers a decent wine list
I just think the prices are high for the type of food the kitchen turns out as well as the portion sizes
I would recommend going, but be aware that it will be at least $75-100/PP
By far my most favorite restaurant in Manhattan
Mix and match the appetizers and cheeses for a fantastic assortment of flavors! The cheese plate and assorted olives are fantastic
The wine selection amazing
A welcome change from the normal bustling places in NYC
The atmosphere was quiet and romantic, and the food was outstanding
The beef carpaccio appetizer was the best I've had
It's a wonderful place to go for a special occasion
GREAT! European atmosphere with delightful ambience: yet old New York
Complete with extensive wine selections for each course prepared
Service was prompt attentive though slightly stuffy
Adequate portions
Charming / Enjoyable
Though if youre low on dough dont dare go!  Food included Oysters, Cerviche, risotto, pheasant/venison and a light chocolate dessert
The service was awful the minute we walked in
A basket of dry bread was thrown on our table - bread as hard as a rock
The waiter took over 15 mins to attend to our table - on top of that he was sweating profusely - hardly an appetising quality at a restaurant
Our friends who ordered the meat dishes - lamb and steak - were incredibly disappointed
It was full of fat! When we asked what was available for dessert we were told verbally in a hurry (were we wasting their time??)
They plonked several plates of deserts down - yuck! If this restaurant has history in its location - thats great - make it a museum but dont attempt to serve what they call food and charge an arm and a leg for bad food and bad service
We will never recommend this horrible place to anyone
We had an overall great experience at Il Buco
We had reservations but a half hour later we were still not seated despite the fact there were numerous empty tables
We got up from the bar and got pushy with the hostess and finally were seated at an excellent table
We found the food very good and the prices good for the quality
Having been to places like La Grenouille, we at least felt we got our money's worth here
Our waiter was very friendly but the service is certainly not polished by any stretch of the imagination
They brought us someone else's appetizer by mistake
We ate it and volunteered to pay for it but they apologized and gave it to us on the house
Overall we loved it, but Annoying ads on the menus to buy their olive oil are AWFUL AND LOW CLASS!!!!!
The FOOD is wonderful, the wines are extaordinary, especially the desserts and dessert wines, AMAZING!! BUT, the staff has an attitude, very very bitchy and NOT AT ALL ITALIAN, just some crude little girls from britain
That is my only complaint: pretentious people and NYC is really not like that for all you tourists out there
Go for the experience but don't feel obliged to tip well, especially if the same attitudes prevail
Il Buco is a cute little restaurant that takes you out of Manhattan and into a European town
The decor, the staff, the menu- everything about this place is the real thing
I had olives and a cheese plate, which were delicious
The only problem I had was that the staff concentrated their service to the people they knew
They need to make a little more effort with the new customers or those people might not become repeat customers
A small gem of a restaurant that transports you far away from the hustle of new york
amazing food and sweet people make this the most charming restaurant in new york
thank you
After reading previous reviews, we were sceptical about dining here
We decided to give it a try anyway and have nothing but good things to say! The staff was very friendly and accomodating
We started off with the olives and olive oil tasting - an absolute must
We then ordered 8 appetizers for our party of 4 and shared them as our meal
We didn't find the portions to be too small or overly salty
In fact, we barely had room for dessert
Il Buco was a great experience, and I would recommend it to friends!
The happy hour is great, the food is very good, yum-mee! Even if you are not that hungry, try the platter at the bar, made of quesadillas, chorizos and flountas, very nice! Margaritas are wonderful, and the price is not at all expensive
Atmosphere is fun and vibrant and the service is numero uno
I've only gotten take-out from this place, but they are always very friendly when I wait and were willing to help me with my questions
The food is pretty pretty good and relatively cheap in comparison to other dine-in places
It's not a very classy place for a romantic date or anything, but it's good for a quick, casual eat and be on your way
DOOZE was GREAT!
Their prices were really cheap and the service was super FRIENDLY
Hi
The food here is really fresh and quite tasty
Try the salmon sushi platter and if you ever need something for a large group - their party platters are beautifully arranged and economical
Hole in the basement wall that serves up my favorite falafels in the city
Highly recommend the super combo and extra stuffed grape leaves
Friendly proprietor (who occassionaly asks you to watch the store when he needs to observe alternate parking rules) who cares more about the food than the decor, don't expect any sort of atmosphere to speak of in the cramped space of four tables and seven chairs
I love Ciao Stella
I don't even know where to begin! The food is excellent
The ambience of the restaurant calls for celebration
The sangria is fabulous- full of fruit and potent! And last, but defintely not least, the owner and her assistants are awesome! They all really go the extra mile to ensure that your experience is memorable
Ciao Stella is #1 for Italian cusine and style in NYC!!
Great drinks and totally rockin' wait-staff
Literally
Julio will seranade you on guitar with everything from Rock Roll to Arabic to Latin American music and keep you company
The fresh mozarella, tomato, basil appetizer was simple and divine
My chicken with artichokes and olives entree was well made
My partner found his pasta a tad drab -- but the place is far too much fun to NOT return
Definitely recommended
Even if you go on a slow night, you won't feel lonely, I promise
Especially recommended for single men since Stella is a total cutie
=)

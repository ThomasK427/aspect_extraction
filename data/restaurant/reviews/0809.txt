It is unique in that it also attracts young, middle and old
The menu has the greatest hits of French bistro food and always some good specials
The wait staff are mainly Eastern Europeans who are professional but not necessarily very personal
The best asset here is the hands-on owner, Manny, who makes all feel extremely welcome
My wife and I wound up here on our way to Serendipity as well, but didn't want to wait for 2 hours, so we just ate here
It was the best pizza we had during our stay in New York! Great service, and we even got to enjoy the evening at one of the tables that are outside on the sidewalk
If you're anywhere close by, you must check this place out!
We placed a phone order for delivery
45 min later called to check and they said they didn't deliver 10 blks away eventhough they took the order and they didn't call us????told us they wrote the phone number down wrong
They apologized but if your pizza doesn't arrive in 20 min CALL THEM!!!!
Deciding not to wait an hour for Serendipity, my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out
The pizza was delicious- probably the best I've ever had
If you've still got room for desert be sure to have their cannoli's, they were to die for!
Incredible! Not your typical New York Pizza but not something you'll find anywhere else
Great if you are going to Serendipity for desert
The pizza was great and came our of the oven very quickly
Fabulous little find on the East Side, fresh ingredients, wonderful selections! You must come back more than once as it is hard to decide what to have, all our outstanding, and don't leave without having a piece of the chocolate cake, the best in New York!
On a recent trip to New York, I had the pleasure of dining at Caf Joul
I can honestly say that it was the best meal that Ive had in years
The dishes were simply prepared with fresh, natural ingredients and a wonderful blend of flavors
The ingredients were blended in a way that was not overpowering, but were made a chef with a masterful hand
The prices were moderate for fine dining, and although the restaurant is relatively small, it was easy to have a quiet conversation even though the tables are fairly close together
It has a casual elegance
I highly recommend a trip to Caf Joul and will definitely return when I am next in the city

This is one of the best finds in Manhattan
An unassuming French Bistro with great (and I really mean great) food
Casual atmosphere
Each menu choice is better than the last
Don't miss this restaurant
Far better food than the stuffy, fancy French restaurants of midtown, at reasonable prices
You'll be glad you stopped by
We found Cafe Joul through friends and after our first meal there we knew we had found the perfect bistro
It has everything you'd expect from a classic French bistro, but the sophisticated but simple variations on the menu make the food delightful as well as satisfying
The onion soup was the best my wife and I have ever had
We've since gone back time and again for romantic dinners, outings with friends, even with my mother-in-law on more than one occasion
Heartily recommended for any occasion, or any time your want a real taste of France
This fun, friendly and overall mellow Sutton area gem is a favorite of the neighborhood locals
Featuring the best French Bistro food in the city, most of the regulars want to keep this place a secret and guilty pleasure
Make Cafe Joul a must-visit! One of the best restaurants in New York -- hands down!!!
We have been to Caf Joul many times having had romantic dinners for two, and on our most recent visit, a small gathering of seven
This special place works brilliantly both ways! All seven in our party were totally delighted with every aspect of last nights dinner
Superb, classic bistro fare (rave reviews of the fish specials, venison and pear tartin in particular), warm atmosphere, and fun to boot! As always, the wait staff was not only attentive, but genuinely nice
The prices were more than fair
Caf Joul is a sure bet whatever the occasion!
We had such a wonderful meal at this lovely restaurant
We were a party of 8 people
The service was great, the food was fabulous-each dish was so special
The beet salad is highly recommended, along with the fish dishes, also the person who ordered the steak was very, very happy
The desserts were also delicious
Atmosphere - lovely! We will return to this excellent restaurant!
I went to Cafe Joul based on the recommendation of a friend of mine who waitresses there
My boyfriend and I didn't really know what to expect of the restaurant, but we ended up have a great night out
Everything we ate -- from appetizer to dessert was tasty and pleasantly presented
Unfortunately, when sometimes asking for wine recommendations you don't get all that knowledgable staff
However, the woman running the bar on this night seemed very familiar with their collection and was able to guide us in the right direction
My only complaint is the somewhat tight space, but that is to be expected in Manhattan restaurants
The black and white film playing in the background was an unexpected, pleasant touch
Never had a bad meal at this restaurant
Eveything was wonderful
Staff is extremely friendly and attentive
The Sat and Sun brunch is a special treat
Menu has everything from great hamburgers to French style cooking
My friends and I are big fans of this cozy and quaint bistro
Cool paintings, warm candlelight, and fabulous wines by the glass keep us coming back for more
Not to mention that the food is divine!! I'm glad this restaurant is a quick ride away and not all the way downtown
Here's a place for very good French food; everything has been good, especially the specials
What we like best, though, is that it is friendly and comfortable
You don't feel like you are in one of those more formal places, but the food is just as good (if not better)
The chef is apparently the owner, so he's seems to always be in the kitchen
And the prices are good; not cheap, but less than you pay elsewhere
Our out-of-town guests have ALWAYS been impressed! and they don't chase you out
I could not agree more with all of the previouos reviews
Friendly, delicious and comfortable, Cafe Joul has become a regular dining spot and a place for special occassions for my partner and me
My favorite dish is the ravioli with truffle sauce - light sweet and delicious
The warm chocalte cake is also amazing
Go soon and you'll go often
Friday movie nights are also good fun - classic silent movies
Cafe Joul is a jewel of a French bistro on the upper east side
Friendliness and excellent food abound thanks to an accommodating staff and the superb efforts of Heidi and husband chef Bertrand
A loyal following makes one feel as if one were dining with friends at home
Works of local artists adorn the walls further enhancing the experience
I have been going to Cafe Joul for years now and have never been even slightly disappointed
For this neighborhood, one gets high-quality, fresh food at an excellent value
The seafood cassoulet is to die for!
Cafe Joul is one of my all-time favorite restaurants in Manhattan
I am always amazed at how wonderful the food is (original, delicious plates, beautiful presentation
I especially love the lemon sole
) and how reasonable the prices are for Manhattan and the high quality of the food
I love the ambiance as well
Feels like you are in a funky French bistro, surrounded by modern art, but with none of the pretension
Very high on my list of recommendations!

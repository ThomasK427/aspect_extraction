Comfort-food is also a NYorkers favorite and from Tajines to Pastas and Mezze appetizer platters for group it is ideal
When was the last time you seen the owners run their own place ? And it seem like the entire staff owns the place too
Want to be a part of the Wizard of OB ?  -We represent public apiness said a Waiter once
I don't care what they say about these guys
it rocks and it is generous in trying it's best to please you and your friends
Decent food, but
s-l-o-w service, way too loud, and the owner is snooty
Too tiny for large groups, despite what the profile recommendations says - I knocked kees with other folks at my table all night
The waiters are obnoxious and the service is poor
Asked for water 4 times and finally got it
They cater to young women having birthdays
There's lots of standing on chairs and clapping, which is fine (I was there for a birthday) except the food is overpriced and average
Overall a disappoinment
I have never experienced this type of rude service before at any restaurant
After an hour of waiting for a table with reservations, we finally decided to leave because we were clearly not getting seated
People without reservations who came in after us were getting seated
The place was crowded and the maitre d is extremely rude and prefers flirting with the pretty customers than doing his job
Don't come here
There are so many better restaurants in the neighbhorhood
went here for a birthday the other night
i guess they lost our reservation because we waited about a half hour for a cramped table that didn't fit our party
the food was okay
the sangria was a little too sour
it seemed like everybody in the place was having a birthday
so i would warn anyone that is planning a birthday dinner - your friend probably won't feel special
though - they do make a big deal and flash the lights on and off and put this crazy sparkler in the birthday dessert, but its anti-climatic the 5th time it happens
I have wanted to go to this restaurant for years and last night was sadly disappointed by the BAD service, mediocre food and uncomfortable seating
The decor is lovely but its really not worth it
I would not go back!
I was a little weary after reading the recent reviews, but we really enjoyed our experience
We had an early reservation, so our service was precise and quick, maybe too quick
It would be a great place for groups
We had the fish tangine and the duck which were both wonderful
Maybe a little pricey, but a good time overall
A+! With quite possibly the finest grilled sardines and shrimp anywhere in NYC, this place is a winner
Great spinach, authentically prepared tangines, music from Franco-Africa and speedy, personal service
Skip the French-america fare (steak frites) and venture into the Moroccan
Its hard to go wrong with any of the tapas, tangines or pastas (strangely) here
i went there for birthday party and i really like  the place and the atmosphere specially the owner was pleasent and very accomodating and trying to make it a good experince
food is good and  the waiters are nice and helpfull
L'Orange Bleue is one of my favorite restaurants in lower Manhattan
It's perfect for a group, especially for special occasions
The food is amazing, and it is so much fun there also
Oh, and the waitors in tight pants
Great for a birthday or any group outing
Definately go with a number of people
Good music, entertainment from the staff, cool place
The food is pretty good too
L'Orange Bleue offers exactly what you wouldn't expect from a trendy bistro-style restaurant, full of tapered French-speaking waiters who glance your way as they chat and snicker - excellent food
The duck roll appetizer was well matched with a sweet dipping sauce, shrimp in garlic sauce was savory and tender - but the real treat was seasonal vegetables with couscous
Sounds simple - but there was nothing simple about the buttery, moist couscous that came to the table covered in a modest chicken-broth and vegetable stew
Once you've had couscous done right, you know what you've been missing
For an apperitif, skip the alcohol and try some Moroccan mint tea, poured from a huge silver show kettle into little shots
It's sweet, made with fresh mint leaves, and absolutely delicious
You won't even notice the catty waiters
Great place with a REAL french staff
Food was great and the staff very eager to please
Great place to get a drink at the bar first
Excellent birthday place 'cos they do some nice surprises
I came here on Friday night with a few of my friends visiting from out of town
We had a blast
The food is great, esp
if you like sharing a bunch of appetizers
The atmosphere is even better
Fun music, belly dancers, and they like it when the crowd gets involved
If you are not careful, you will find yourself dancing on a chair
Drinks are good too, esp
if you like mojitos
Definitely worth the trip
They serve a great brunch here
We had the poached eggs on Maryland crabcakes and the brioche french toast
both were delicious
The service was pleasant and fast
The only negative here was that the OJ wasn't freshed squeezed, and no half/half for the coffee
just milk
Other than that, it was great
We've been here for dinner, as well, and the atmosphere is definitely lively and the food just as delish
My all time favorite restaurant for dinner and Sunday brunches
All around fun
The waiters have a lot of energy
Birthdays are super fun here too
Monday nights are especially interesting with the Middle Eastern theme and a belly dancer
I highly recommend this place
Really good food, great location and good service, I don't understand how anyone could complain about this place
It's true they don't accept VISA or MC but there are plenty of ATM's in SOHO
Especially good place for birthdays, just don't expect yours to be the only one celebrated there that night
For a good time call L'Orange Bleue
it was worht the trip downtown and I would revisit
The atmosphere alone makes it worth the trip and the food adds even more
Fun restaurants usually lack on the food end but this place keeps you coming back for more
I randomly wandered into Fratelli with a friend during a visit to NYC, and was warmed by the sweet folks welcoming us in
I'm glad they convinced me to visit, because Fratelli was a great dining experience
The food was fresh and flavorful and the servers were wonderful! It's also very affordable
Keep it up Fratelli! I will definitely be back!
When looking for an authentically Italian restaurant in Little Italy, go where the Italians go! My friends and I felt as if we were welcomed into the home of an extended Italian family
Several staff members and friends sat near the window and greeted all visitors
The wait staff were warm, considerate, helpful and unobtrusive
The food was great
The restaurant is not at all touristy or pretentious, rather it is a warm and simple place to enjoy wonderful Italian food and warm and friendly Italian people!
I have being going to Fratelli's for quite some time and feel as if I must spread the word

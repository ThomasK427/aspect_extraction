I am a very picky person, and I would return to this place to eat again
Okay, the food is good but there are about 10 other great steak places in this city with staff that actually care about their customers
We were told by the manager, after we were kept waiting for 45 minutes after our reservation time, that people can wait for up to a couple of hours, regardless of reservations and that we should consider ourselves lucky!! The waiter was not only rude and dismissive but he was about as smart as the entrees! The sommelier was the only bright spot of the evening
What can you say about the homestead? Its home for animal eaters like me
I've never been disapointed here and I know I never will
For me, its better than Luger's
But thats me
Plus, its stumbling distance from meatpacking bars
Just so many positives i don't know where to end
And I love love love the cow out front
Never take it down, ever
Even if this place becomes a shoe store in like 300 years, please keep the cow
To me, the homestead IS New York
Where do I begin, we were greeted by a really nice lady who walked us to our table for four and then our waiter walked over, what should I say, he was not the friendliest person, he gave us our menus and walked away after 15 min
of seeing everyone eating food being walked past us we had to call him over
When he brought our food it was as if was being tossed in front of us
But, it was a great watching him treat the table next to us like royalty
The food was good but, it wasn't enjoyable! After dinner our waiter takes the bill and the manager tells him to clear our table so that we could leave
Not only did our waiter treat us badly, he was pushing us out and he double billed us for the liquor
Why pay to be treated horribly?
We have always enjoyed the quality steaks served here, however the last two visits were greatly marred by indifferent and smug service
One visit inflicted basically unavailable service with the wrong (higher priced) wine being delivered
Both were Chianti Reserva, however one was priced in the high 30s and the wrong higher priced was in the 70s
We barely examined the wine except to see the word Chianti Reserva and the correct year
We drank it and was slightly shocked when the check arrived
It took a meeting of 20 minutes to, however to their credit, remove the higher priced wine and bill us for the wine we ordered
The last visit featured a waiter who seeming couldn't care less
We had to virtually pull every bit of non-offered information from him
Enough already, leave the attitude at home and do your job man
So unnecessary and thoroughly annoying
My husband and I ate at the Old Homestead and had a great experience
The service was terrific--we were not rushed at all
When the food came out we were promtly checked on, our waters were filled, and the rest of our wine poured for us
Service was great to me
But who knows, maybe we had the best server in the house
Our steaks were delicious--The rib eye and steak au poivre were devine
The kobe beef carpaccio appetizer was excellent
It's a steakhouse, so your atmosphere isn't gonna be good
But if you like steak, the Old Homestead is pretty darn good
The food is good, and it looks feels like a steakhouse but the waiters suck
We ordered 6 shrimp as an appetizer, only four came we had to ask for the other 2 (but first we were told we only ordered 4)
I ordered a CajunRibeye - No cajun spices anywhere on the meat
After I told the waiter this he offered to rub my ALREADY COOKED steak in cajun spices for me!!! Are you kidding?! Another person ordered a medium steak which was flat out rare
It took 20 minutes to get his steak back after the waiter took it away
They NEVER refilled our water glasses wihtout prompting
And a bus boy dropped a glass on my friend's back which fell on the floor and broke
It was cleaned up 30 MINUTES LATER!!!??  After we left we had that We just went to a tourist trap feeling
Went here with a group of 10 recently, seated promptly as we had made reservations in advance
The waiter took our orders and that's when the fun started
Half the appitizers came, two came 15 minutes later and three never came at all
We all had steaks, some 10 oz some 18 oz, some medium rare, some rare
The waiter brought everyone 18 oz
medium rare steaks, he said he misunderstood those who ordered the smaller ones
Then he forgot three side orders and topped the evening of by trying to add 100 dollars to the bill
The food wasnt bad, just wasnt what we ordered, but the horrible service we got ruined the evening for us therefore we will never ever go here again and would not reccomend it to my worst enemy
I showed up with a friend late one night without reservations and was delighted to get seated right away
Unfortunately, that was the best part of the experience
We ordered appetizers which were just ok
I was really looking forward to the steak
We ordered a rib eye and a filet, both medium rare
Both were overdone, with the filet being cooked completely through
Our side order hash brown looked nice, but was tasteless
Fair to say we will never come here again
My cousin and I were in the mood for steak one night
We were in Chelsea and happened to spot this place
We ordered the porterhouse for 2 and a side dish
Simply, the side dish was the best part of the meal
The steak lacked flavor and was really fatty
It was a major dispappointment to say the least especially since we craved a good steak
Talk about not hitting the spot! In a nutshell we shelled out a pretty penny for a tastey side dish and 2 glasses of wine because that steak tasted like what I imagine a shoe would taste like
I don't recommend this place for steak but maybe for the side dishes and people watching if you're seated outside
The Old Homestead is my favorite NYC steakhouse, and on a visit from Michigan to NYC my sons took me there to celebrate my 70th birthday
We were a party of nine (my wife and myself, our two sons and their wives, and three grandchildren)
We were seated promptly, and the waiters were pleasant and efficient
The men had beef, the women lamb or seafood, and everything was lovely
My only complaint is that my grandson and I had the steak au poivre
We requested that they be cooked medium rare, but both were medium by any definition (incuding that on the menu)
Still, it was a splendid evening and it is puzzling to me that so many reviewers have had bad experiences at this historic restaurant
I went with my boyfriend recently
He made a reservation and we came on time, but we had to wait for 45 mins to get seated
Our waiter was a joke! We asked for a wine list, again, waited for 15 mins
I had ordered a petit filet mignon for medium rare, but came in a fully cooked
Taste yuck and so disappointed! With the long wait and food, I would NOT recommend
In my opinion you can't do it very much different
Of course I like The Big Texan in Amarillo and Arthur Bryant in Kansas City but New York is New York and a steakhouse is a steakhouse
And The Old Homestead is as good as the others
Maybe a notch below in ambiance and flair/style, but not in food
Both guests and waiters are not as 'elegant' as some of the other competitors but the food is
It's a New York steakhouse, and it's good
Yes, fantastic oysters as well
I haven't had better in years!
Where's the Beef? At the Old Homestead! Bigger and better than any other steakhouse
Just order your meat one level more well done than you usually do, this way you will get it the way you like
Do to the extreme thick cut of beef that they serve it tends to be under-cooked if you don't order this way
An institution not to be overlooked
All steaks are served ala-carte but a variety of sides are available and sized to match their steaks
Bring your appetites, you will not be leaving this place feeling hungry! Hope I steer you in the right direction
I was so disenchanted after eating here that I felt like I had to sign up for citysearch in order to give a fair review
They were able to seat us promptly
But the later service was horrible

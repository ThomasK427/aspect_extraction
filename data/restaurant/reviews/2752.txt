Still look for the ultimate italian
I have been to Al Di La 3 times now and each time, I have had an incredibly memorable, wonderful, unique experience
The beet ravioli and swiss chard ravioli completely redefine ravioli - not some chewy dough with stuff inside it, but delicately-wrapped flavor packets with lively flavor
Everything from the pastas to the meats and fish are excellent here
I recommend sharing dishes so you can sample more stuff
The rustic atmosphere is convivial without being too loud or boisterous
The staff is knowledgeable and patient
I have been to this restaurant more than a dozen times
Yes, the wait is long and annoying, yes the service is a little bit limp, and yes, it can sometimes take a WHILE to get your food, but that could just be part of the charm
There is always a wait because people always want to dine there
The food IS that good
Its all about the food and sharing it with someone you dont mind talking to for an hour or so
to me that sounds like a perfect evening
I've ben waiting to try Al Di La for a while, but the menu just never grabbed me
I ended up trying it last weekend and I was really disappointed
This is the kind of place with that strange mix of neighborhood charm and accessibility and just a pinch of nouveau brooklyn pretense
the menu is different but not terribly appetizing, the waitstaff (hostess and male waiter) aren't rude but certainly are indifferent and turn what should be a warm, pretty room into a somehow remote atmosphere
I had a very tasty carpaccio, but then followed up by a limp tagliatelle in a mildly spiced but otherwise flavorless meat ragu
Someone else had the saltimbocca which was average at best
I felt like I should have definitely gone elsewhere
OVERRATED
On Saturday, 9/17/05, my boyfriend and I went for dinner
First, the hostess rudely told us the wait would be 45 minutes (yelling at me for my dripping umbrella as it poured outside)
After sitting in a bar across the street for an hour, we called
She said we were next on the list
20 minutes later, we were seated, with about two tables seated moments after us
After 5 minutes, those tables all at least had wine
No one had come to our table
After 10 more minutes, a table next to us was seated and were waited on immediately, we still waited
During the 15 minutes, I made eye contact with the hostess, and each time she looked away
At that point, I stood up and walked out
I've NEVER been treated so rudely in a restaurant
The food is great, no doubt
But it's not worth it
I was visiting Park Slope from San Francisco
We wanted to find a nice place to have dinner with friends
Al Di La is the spot
The appetizers are out of this world
Try the Swiss Chard Stems, which appear to be marinated before being wood smoked
The tomato and parmesian soup is Italian perfection
A very solid wine list to accompany the food
However, I found the entrees to be slightly less desirable than the appetizers, although still very good
With the choices available in Park Slope, Al Di La truly is a stand-out
Or you could take the R a few stops, spend 50% more, and not get as good of food as you will here
You cannot lose with this restaurant
I've lived in Park Slope for six years and find it hard to go anywhere else in the neighborhood for a decent meal
Walk in through a thick velvet curtain and find food that is pitch perfect (beet ravioli is sublime) at prices that are very reasonable - $10 to 18
The service is top-notch and well-educated about the food and wine
Wooden tables with white cloths, pounded tin ceiling, windows overlooking the street
Show up on the early side to assure no wait
ZERO pretention
Perfect
I dont understand any of the reviews that are negative for this place
Fantastic dining, quality, exceptionally prepared food served by a very knowledgeable staff with the best value in the 5 boros
The only quibble you could make is in the limited menu
However, one has to wonder if the success is tied to the ability to focus on a few high quality offerings
Worth the trip from Manhattan
it was ok, but not my cup of tea, kind of pretentious\ sorry, i won't be coming back
Al Di La was much better as a song - sweet, heart wrenching and sincere, unlike the staff at this parkslope trot'
The food is ok at best, but the service and the uncomfortable accomidations have such a negetive effect, that one can only wonder why they waited so long for so little
My applauds do go out to the chef (the wife I believe) for her delicious rendition of rabbit - succulant
But the rest of the fare was just fair
i can't believe some of the negative reviews in here
my boyfriend and i just went here for the first time last night
we went around 8:30 and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table
al di la is totally authentic italian trattoria style
the service is very attentive without hovering
and the FOOD! wow! i had the tortelli w/ delicata squash and mascarpone
it just melted in your mouth
this is some of the best italian food i've had outside of italy herself
real attention to detail and the pasta is all homemade
and it shows
mmm, i'm still savoring my meal
i also had the special appetizer: a huge piece of foccacia, a deliciously stinky piece of cheese and a side of the tastiest mixed greens i've ever had
the balsamic dressing the put on it is amazing
i'll totally come back
I've been hearing great things about this restaurant since I moved to Brooklyn, but everytime I stopped by the wait was over an hour
So on an early Friday night, we got the last table available before being made to wait
The wine list was small but had a nice variety
I had the aspargus and egg appetizer which was indulgent and the braised rabbit which was wonderful as well
We split the rhubarb crisp (last one at only 8:00!) which was incredible
The waiter was helpful and conscientious
The only con could be the chance at being seated cafeteria style, but it just makes it easier to ask your neighbor what they got
This place is so lovely
Even if you hate beets, try the beet ravioli- you will not be disappointed! The service is sweet and attentive, the wine is delicious and the new wine bar around the corner has the most amazing selection, as well as cheeses and tapas
The oxtail in squid ink is as yummy as it doesn't sound
Amazing, imaginative, authentic and subtle food from appetizers to deserts
The wait is long, the room is a bit cramped, but the food is truly superlative
I've lived in N
Park Slope for a number of years and this has to be the most over-rated spot in the Slope
Food is good but not worth the praise
There are certaintly much better spots on that strip
And what is up with the no reservation but we can call your cell phone when your table is ready - Just take reservations at that point
Terribly unimpressed
After being pointed to our table, we waited 15+ minutes for a server to approach
Another 20 minutes passed before my husband had to approach the owner and ask for our drinks
They arrived with no apology
Needless to say, we weren't suprised when our server told us he never put our appetizer order in
Once again, we waited, for that, then again for our entrees which were mediocre at best
During dinner, we sat drinkless once again, as the server and owner never checked on us

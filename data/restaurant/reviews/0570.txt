Stopped in here for an afterdinner drink with friends the other night
The place is pleasant enough, and the music's solid
But stay away if you're serious about your beer
Ordered a pint of Guinness, and the bloke simply filled up the glass as if it were a Budweiser
I asked for a pint pulled the real way, and he gave me a blank stare
Well, most people don't like to wait, he shrugged
After a little cajoling, he agreed to pull me another pint--which he again mucked up
Mr
Elmo, if your bar is going to carry Guinness, and charge $7(!) for the pleasure, please teach your bartenders how to pour it, okay? Sheesh
My friend and I went for lunch the other day during our lunch hour
The staff there are not attentive at all
In fact, when we asked for help, we were ignored! When our food was delivered (eons later) it was warm
Our waiter never came back to check on us and we had to ask to get our water refilled
We again had to ask for our check (eons later) and had to rush out of there to get back to work
We didn't feel welcome there and won't go back
Elmo looks cool from the outside and the DJ beside the bar is an unexpected treat
Loud, but not obnoxious
Dress is very casual, your tank top and shorts will fit in fine here (my date and I were way overdressed)
Menu is American comfort food, they make stuff here that you're too tired or pressed for time to make at home (Fried chicken, meatloaf, etc)
And it's quite reasonably priced
Overall, a good place to go with friends but not a date
I love elmo for brunch
They have seating outside in the sun where you can just relax and watch the world go by
The ceaser salad is amazing and the scrambled eggs are awesome
Don't forget to order a raspberry lemonade or your brunch will not be complete!
My friends and I came here last night, and it was fun
We were seated promptly, but the waiter was a little slow to take our order
The food and drinks were good, and the prices were even better
Come here if you want to see good-looking waitstaff
Of course, looks aren't everything, but it doesn't hurt to have eye candy serving your food
The ambiance was very nice
Overall, a good experience
The food at Elmo was OK
I had a 12 dollar cheeseburger with mediocre fries
It is convinient and did not have a wait, which is why we choose it over other resturants, I feel that I now know why there was no wait
I've eaten at Elmo several times, and each time it gets better and better
The food is good and the prices are great
The staff is mostly friendly and helpful and of course, like most people in chelsea, beautiful
Great for parties or a date
We were a party of 4 on a slow Sunday afternoon for brunch
It was not crowded
no excuse for bad service
One meal did not come at all - he never put it in the computer
The pancakes were good, but don't have blueberry pancakes on the menu of you are not able to produce more than three tiny blueberries in each pancake
The french toast was delicious
Service too slow
Passed by on the street and saw a nice burger, but it was crowded, decided to come at 4PM
At 4PM, just a few customers, got a table inside
The door was open, it was COOOLD! After a 5 minute wait, got them to shut the door
Another 5 minute wait, they took my order
25 minute wait, the burger arrives, luke-warm, with luke-warm, salty fries
Asked for a slice of pickle, another 5 minute wait
Couple sitting next to me going through the same thing
Very cute staff, obviously professional models, obviously amateurs at the restaurant game
When the staff decides to put on a modelling show, I'm there
For my next burger, I'm definitely gonna be somewhere else!
Normally its a good place to meet for drinks
Not much in the way of food though
Good atmosphere, bad music, large martinis
It all depends on when you go
Some nights it feels right at home - a combination of Chelsea boys and good looking straight couples
Last time we stopped by for a drink the bar was full of chubby drunk girls with low cut jeans and thongs
You just never know
Good food, medium trendy, very chelsea
Much better than Cafeteria
I had the Elmo salad and a monk fish special, both of which were quite good
My husband had the macaroni and cheese appetizer which was delicious! Dessert is a bit of a weak link, I'd definitely go back
It's a good value
Went there for brunch last week, and I had a very nice meal, and two great bloody Marys
After reading the reviews here I was wondering if they were talking about the same restaurant
Then again, maybe the people at Elmo read the reviews and decided to clean up their act
Or maybe the brunch staff is better than the dinner staff
A friend of mine recently chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner, and after reading the reviews here, I was dreading going
But when I got there, the food was excellent, the prices were reasonable, and the service was good
I would definitely recommend it, and I'll go back
All I have to say is that looks can be very decieving!!! The place looked great but it was the worst dining experience that I have ever had
The drinks had NO alcohol, the service was slow, and worst of all, I got a MINI-ME sized portion of filet mignon (seemed like it was no bigger that a quarter) that came with burnt potato chips!! They need to put more into their food and service rather than the decor
Never again
Let me first say, I went into this establishment with an open mind
However, I was highly disappointed
The drinks were below avg and overpriced
The menu had about 5 items and overpriced
The service was not attentive
The only positive aspect of this place was the ambience
very trendy
Albeit, I thought I was in a village people's video shoot
Overall I would never go back
I had the salmon which was pretty good - the corn salsa that came with it was nice and spicy
The drinks were definitely very colorful - I had a raspberry lemonade which was very delicious
The worst part of the meal was the dessert - I tried the chocolate mousse and it definitely was not edible - it was super sweet and the chocolate didn't taste good and I'm a BIG FAN of chocolate, so it was kind of disappointing
Our waitress was super nice
She was very attentive
The Miami modernist look of this place is cool and comfortable
Do do something about the acoustics, I couldn't hear the person across from me
The service was attentive
I did have to return my martini twice, because it kept on arriving dirty and I like mine clean
My bass on risotto was very well prepared, and so were my friends' tuna and mussels (fat and flavorful, better than the mussels I recently had at Markt and Florent
) The fish portions were too small and overpriced, but still delicious
Is it the scene or the chow? Elmo is definitely for the scene and the food LOOKS good, but tastes average
Buy some new clothes and enjoy putting your narcissist self on display

We had reservations for 8:15 and by 9:00 left because we were still getting every excuse possible as to why we weren't being seated
In addition people without reservations were being seated because they had waited almost an hour for a table
The host staff was telling every single party that their table was next on the list and the woman seating kept explaining that there wasn't an exact science to the seating process
I would suggest hiring a host staff with half a brain and then teaching them about customer service
I definitely won't ever be back
The food is excellent, and even better, there is the added pleasure of knowing that it's good for you-- no post-indulgence guilt accompanies Josie's fare! The ambience is warm and inviting, and it doesn't hurt that the waitstaff is particularly aesthetically palatable as well
Josie's keeps your bank account as full as your stomach, and there is something appealing on the menu for almost everyone
One of the best places in NYC for food that feels like home but is better than anything your mom has ever cooked
One of the better restaurants in the UWS (that's not saying much), Josie's is to be commended for its dedication to earth-friendly eating
But it looks like success has gone to this joint's head
While the food for the most part is still fine, service has taken a nose-dive
The hostesses are rude, smarmy, and insincere
They're far more concerned with filling seats than with making the people they're sitting down feel welcome
I wouldn't usually call health food comfort food--but if you have had a long day of work and just want to eat something nice that won't make you feel like crap with a good friend, Josie's is the place to go
The best food delivery in the West 72nd St
neighborhood
They have a separate menu (from their restaurant menu) for delivery
They deliver quickly
The food is always fresh and delicious
They serve vegetarian meals, free-range meats, excellent fish dishes and more
My favorite is the glazed grilled salmon served with mixed veges - it's out of this world
This is a great place to go to if your party is a mix of vegetarians and normal people
They have an extensive veggie menu with good meat dishes as well
Their drinks are excellent
I had dinner at Josie's for the first time and really enjoy the relaxed atmosphere there
It is also Zen like and each entree sounded delicious
My fellow diners were as equally please with their meal as I was with mine
I highly recommend this place
Josie's Restaurant in NYC (2 locations) personifies a healthy, satisfying dining experience
They offer a large variety of vegetarian and organic dishes, as well as some non-vegan, yet healthful options
All water used and served in the restaurants is thoroughly filtered, which is a nice plus
Having been a Josie's guest for 4 years now, I can say that every meal I've been served by the friendly staff has been a treat
I always leave satisfied and happy, because I know I've had a great meal, and I've done something smart for my body
Try the black bean dumplings and vegetarian meatloaf, and to drink, a delicious, fresh juice
Make it a point (and a habit) to dine at Josie's
You'll be glad that you did
I have been to Shun Lee Cafe 8 times over three years
MOST of the time the dim sum is good: the fried items are usually crisp and the steamed things are tender
Try to get them to give you the freshly made items when they come out of the kitchen, rather than the baskets from the top of the stack
Naturally they put the fresher food on the bottom to keep things moving but I ended up with dried out jumbo shrimp last night because it was slow and food sat around a bit
Also, if you do get a bum dumpling, tell them! They'll bring you fresh
Very nice, old-school courtesy from the staff, including the bathroom attendant, so bring singles with you
If you're going to Lincoln center or to a concert at central park, this is the place for an interesting, not that expensive meal
They couldn't do enough for you
The service was efficient and smiling
As an avid dim sum diner, I thought this place was way above average
Interesting steamed combinations of healthy dumplings, veggies with peanuts, shrimp scallops and scallions, lots , very tasty and not too salty or greasy
They also came around with a tray of various fried appetizers to choose from
We made room for one main course to share after all those appetizers and it was roast pork with scallions in a light hoisen sauce
It wasn't heavily sauced and the pork was perfectly lean
We will be back
My first time actually going to a semi dim sum place and what a really good experience
Although is a bit crowded reservations should be made on sundays, the place was well worthy
Although the dim sum was a bit pricey the main courses were not
The dim sum is definitely quality, although quite overpriced
However, if you don't want to trek it to Chinatown, and you're ready to (relatively speaking) open your wallet for dim sum is a clean environment, Shun Lee Cafe is the way to go
The best part about this place is that it serves Dim Sum on Sundays till way past brunch (dinner time!)
However, get ready to wait, or make a reservation
this place is always packed with upper westsiders on a sunday! A word of advice-- the NON dim sum food here is mediocre-- just go ONLY for the dim sum!!
Not luxury Chinese like the Shun Lee next door, but ceretainly a couple of notches above the corner Chinese take-out joint
That goes for the decor as well
Shun Lee Cafe offers some of the same food as the next-door place does, but with dim sum -- both steamed and fried -- as well
Everything is well prepared and service is somewhat attentive
Among the slim pickings around Lincoln Center, this is a good one
This is easily one of the best chinese restaurants in NY or anywhere else
The menu is quite substantial, with a number of chicken, beef, and seafood specialties not found at your typical chinese restaurant
The dining room is classy and elegent, the service is attentive (perhaps a little snobby)
I've been to shun lee on 3 separate occasions
Each time the food was perfectly prepared -- i
e
crispy beef was crisp yet juicy
Grand marnier prawns not overcooked and flavored well
Major detraction to this place is the prices
It's at least double the price of regular chinese
Normally this would really bother me, but i don't think about this as going out for chinese so much as going out for a really nice, elegant meal
Other similar quality meals in nyc could easily cost twice as much as Shun Lee
I've never been to the big sister next door, but this little spot has very good food and decent prices
Service was good, though the dim sum pushers were a little overwhelming
Shun Lee Cafe is far lower in quality than its sister restaurant next door
I went there last night with a friend, both excited to try the food since we've never been there
I ordered the spicy salmon with vegetables
The food came and it was awful! Too salty and the supersweet sauce was quite thick, I had difficulty ingesting
Service-wise: my friend's merlot never came, her dimsum was pasty/soggy and no, not even a freakin' fortune cookie or slice of orange
Meanwhile, people on the next table who ordered a bottle of wine, got the royal treatment with a presumably warm roll of cloth to freshen up before dinner
I don't recommend going there and I certainly won't be back
Best uptown spot for dim sum
Skip the more formal restaurant next door
Very yummy dim sum and other stuff for a casual and more relaxed atmosphere
They get you in and out fast for theater goers at Lincoln Center
Cool decor and you will not leave hungry! Get everything from the dim sum carts and you'll never have to trek so far for good Chinese again
I've been to the Penang in Soho and decor-wise, I liked that place better
However, the food at both places is pretty much the same- reliably good, filling, and cheap! I recommend the Roti Telur for an appetizer (there's enough for 2) and for the entrees, the Mee Goreng fried noodles and the mango chicken
Food and ambience was generally good
The glass noodles were tasty, but the meat in one of the beef dishes was a little tough/tendon-ish/dry
Ambience is as others have described, candle-lit with large glass windows, pan-Asian decor, bar
Wait staff were inexplicably pushy tonight, however (which I haven't experienced on past visits)
It was a Tuesday night with plenty of empty tables and they kept hovering and asking to clear our dishes before we'd finished, aside from missing the glasses twice in a row while pouring water
Took my girlfriend here for dinner on a friday night, we were seated promptly and the service continued to be good for the remainder of the evening
We shared the Calimari which was prepared very differently then we expected (for the better)
We followed with the duck, which was good, but we were mesmerized at the people next to us who ordered the coconut shrimp - It looked and smelled amazing, it'll have to be something we come back for

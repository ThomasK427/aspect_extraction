decor is lovely
go here for the drinks! esp
during happy hour! enough said! the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm
Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan
My fav was the sassy lassi
This is a wonderful alternative to the 6th ST or Lexington Indian restaurants
The food is great, service is friendly and attentive and the decor is relaxing with an outdoor seating area
I found the prices to be very reasonable, particulary the weekend brunch buffet ($9
95 with a drink and all that you can eat)
I have been to a lot of Indian restaurants in New York and found the food here to be really good
They also have tons of vegetarian dishes and the food is less greasy than a lot of places
Mirchi does a creditable job with Indian food
It's not the same chicken tikka/saag paneer/samosa menu rehashed (although that stuff is there), which is nice
In the end, there were no surprises
Service was very good, and the restaurant is very attractive
I'd go back, unless I found a really good Indian place down there
Prices are fair for tourstland
If you're not very hungry and would rather enjoy a few drinks and the ambience, then this is worth a try
But - I grew up eating Indian street food - this one doesn't even come close
The non-street stuff was nothing to write home about either
Didn't think it was value for money
Great food, pleasant staff, creative menu
We've been here several times and have never been disappointed
spicy indian food prepared in an open
sparkling clean kitchen - whilst good times can certainly be had here in the eve - the lunch menu is the way to go - tandori box with veggie, rice, and nan is the best deal in town!!!
Went in on a Thursday to get a drink and saw that there was a downstairs bar area that was open
very cool atmosphere! The martinis were 1/2 price as well
Service was a tad slow downstairs, but thats my only gripe
Not the wisest place to come when you're in a hurry
Recently I stopped by before a movie and, although the restaurant was not overly crowded and we were seated right away, we had to wait ten minutes before a server approached us
We ordered drinks, an appetizer and entrees
Fifteen minutes later, when we asked about our drinks, another server went to investigate and found that they'd run out of one of the liqueurs they needed and had gone out to get more -- which is fine, but it would've been nice to know
Our food eventually arrived and was delicious -- nicely spiced and well-prepared
But the division of labor among the servers could use some work -- they were all pleasant and seemed well-meaning, but it was impossible (for us and apparently for them) to tell who was in charge of what, which left some glaring gaps
The Scene It's hard to know whether the French are moving to Fort Greene in droves or it's just that those who do always open a restaurant
Lou Lou's French country restaurant is one of the area's most popular Gallic spots: carefully-aged decor and occasionally cloying folk music are rustic, but both food and service are the epitome of polished
The Food The husband and wife team behind Lou Lou turn out French country cooking with pizzazz from this tiny kitchen
Star appetizers include quail with vanilla and maple glaze and butternut squash polenta, and scallops with portobello mushrooms in a vermouth cream sauce
The specialty of the house is seafood, of which the deliciously creamy monkfish--served with a roasted tomato and creme fraiche sauce and yukon gold potatoes--is the highlight
Rainbow trout comes pan-seared, whole and fresh in a langoustine sauce; try the crisp pike when available
Yesterday, DJs Bobbito and Rich Medina gave a free concert at Ft Greene Park, afterwards my friends and I went to restaurant row on DeKalb
I've been to Lou Lou's for brunch but not dinner, so we tried it and bumped into DJ Bobbito, Rosie Perez, Annabella Sciorra and friends who had come there as well
My lambburger was superb, so was the salmon and the chicken
The wait staff were not preoccupied by the celebs and we were well taken care of
I would definitely reccomend
each time i dined at lou lou's was a pleasant experience
excellent service and food is yum
Step into Loulou's with its weathered white and blue wood furniture and nautical touches, and feel transported to a quaint restaurant in Brittany
Lunch brunch offer a large variety of sweet and savory crepes - a specialty of the region - like wild mushroom, or ham, cheese, and egg
Dinner is more substantial, with duck confit salad, mussels, and quite a few seafood offerings
There's also a lovely garden in the back, perfect for the warmer months
We've been consistent guests of Lou Lou almost since it opened, and have returned because the service and food quality have been very good and very consistent
The atmosphere is genuinely neighborhood bistro where the management gets to know its patrons
The food is always very tasty and tastefully prepared, with a well mannered staff that generously attends to your needs
Lou Lou's sister resturant in Park Slope (Cocotte) is also recommended
We're new to the neighborhood and happened to stumble in on a Thursday when they were offering two entrees for the price of one
The salmon tartare was excellent, and although I played it safe with steak frites, I tasted some other very good entrees at the table
The chocolate banana crepe is highly recommended
I can't wait until they open up the outside seating in back and start offering dinner and a movie
My first meal was so good that I thought I had died and gone to heaven
My last meal left us all so hungry and dissatisfied (after a 3-course meal nonetheless) we had to go next door for some pizza
Unfortunately this was not an isolated event but rather the end of an ongoing saga of bad experiences at my once favorite restaurant
The service has been going downhill
When the menu says scallops and what you get is one miserable scallop, that ain't right
Or when your food is accompanied by potatoes, you should not have the urge to eat your plate to satisfy you hunger
If the crepe comes with salad, I assume that is not refering to the three leaves that garnished my plate - or at least it didn't used to prior to Lou Lou's depression days
We arrived last night for the dine in brooklyn special and it was a cute romantic restaurant tucked away on a Fort Greene Street
It was full
The service was excellent
The owner stopped by to chat with us
And we noted that there is a 19 dollar prix fixe special from Sunday to Thursdays
What a deal
I had a wonderful seared scallop on Mango relish with avocade appetizer - just the right size to make me hungry for the wonderful rare hangar stear which was seignon
Dessert cheescake was wonderful
Lou Lou in Fort Greene is an underrated gem as most restaurants in Brooklyn are
There are many restaurants in Brooklyn but this is in the top 5%
The food is great every time I go there
The service is better than most places in Manhattan
It is low key and unpretentious
They have a good wine list, which has a few non-standard bottles on it
The desserts are spectacular and are presented on the menu with a continental after dinner digestive offering
For an intimate restaurant it was amazing
It is definitely work the trip into Brooklyn to eat there
NO COMPLAINTS HERE
EVERY THING WAS SPENDID
THE FOOD WAS DELISCIOUS, THE STAFF FRIENDLY AND THE ROOM WAS INVITING
IF I LIVED IN BROOKLYN I'D BE HERE ALL THE TIME
My girlfriend and I just spent our 10 month anniversary at Lou Lou
We'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a Monday night
It was pleasantly uncrowded, the service was delightful, the garden adorable, the food (from appetizers to entrees) was delectable
There was even a French movie showing on a screen at the front of the garden
So so cute and charming! I'll be back often
I love Lou Lou! The food is fantastic and so is the service
The small setting makes you feel special rather than just another table
The new Prix Fixe during the week is a great deal but the weekend specials are really worth the price
Hope they have the monkfish when you go
If you had a chance to see Michael Jordan shoot some hoops in your neighbourhood court, wouldn't you want to at least see what the hype was all about??? Joe (the head chef at LouLou) has skills that put other chefs to shame, but will make you feel like you've stumbled onto a secret weapon
He hasn't been working his magic here for too long (6 months I think) but he has single handedly turned this place into a gold mine
I continue to be enchanted by the food, service and warmth of my favorite neighborhood spot
Though Mom Pop are scarce these days, busy with the opening of their second restaurant, you would never know with the continued attentive, friendly service and consistently delectable food

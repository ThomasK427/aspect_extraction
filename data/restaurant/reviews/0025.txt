We politely asked to move our table to a less obtrusive area, and the waitress hasseled us instead of accommodating us
We didn't complain
The food was mediocre
We didn't complain
However, the rudeness of the waitstaff was unbearable and really put a damper on our joyous mood
This place is the worst ever!
I love this place
The food is really worth the money
I go there all the time
For my birthday celebration friends took the liberty of taking me to China Grill
At first I was shocked by the price, but the excellent and friendly service from our waiter Jack was great and the duck salad was the best ever
The highlight of the night was just the warm happy birthday from the owner and the warm pleasant atmosphere of the restaurant, I can't wait to go again
Overall, the ambiance at China Grill is mediocre and generic, the food was nothing special and overpriced and the staff was snobby and dismissive
We went to China Grill for Restaurant Week
For $140 + tax/tip we received only 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for four people
Despite promises of greatness, the appetizers were small (6 dumplings to share, 1 chicken breast and 1 thigh to share
)
When we mentioned that the dishes seemed small for $35/pp, the manager was haughty and rude and the waiter sarcastic
The treatment might have been tolerable if the food was excellent, but it wasnt
We left hungry and annoyed
I went thinking it was a restaurant you have to experience in New York, and left wishing I spent my money elsewhere
The food was horrible, we had the Peking duck salad, tuna, vegetable fried rice, and the spinach
The food all came out exactly two minutes after we placed our order
The salad looked as though they have a premixed trash bag full of it, and they just dump a heap of it on a plate
The tuna was room temperature and had to have been already prepared considering how quickly it came out
The fried rice was good
Bottom line, the food is way over priced for the poor quality, and little care they put into preparing it
You are definitely not missing out on anything if you never make it here, you will only find yourself thinking that you could have gone to your local Chinese restaurant
I've been to China Grill all over the US, in Miami, Vegas, and a number of times in NY
I've never been disappointed
The music is a little bit louder, but the food is excellent
The Tuna steak is great, the service is very good, overall i recommend everyone to go there
The dishes are family style with good portions
The ambience, is trendy with plenty of room all around
Great pick
Outside staff- poor english
Apps- chili shrimp, tempura sashimi, entree's- rack lamb, kobe tartar, crispy spinach
Shrimpfirst
Next tartar- sent back- waiting for tempurah app
Waiter didn't understand bc language barrier, became hostile
MIA bottle of wine
next lamb and spinach, sent back, waiting for tempura app, wine
Complained to manager
Was the last we saw of the waiter until he came to collect check
Temporah gross, seared tuna drowned in cream sauce
Spinach inedible, Tartar disgusting, lamb so well done, was hockey puck, didn't eat any of
Wanted to show manager, bus boy cleared apparently didn't understand either
from time manager came no one checked on us again
Wine came right before entree, wanted to sit and drink
bus boy brought the check w/o being asked for
every table outside complained to manager
manager comped bottle, bill still 157 for 5 dishes, 4 of which were inedible
This restaurant has been around for years, and it just keeps on going
It's pretty typical for modern pan-asian but this restaurant was pan-asian before there was pan-asian
It's always busy, always a hotspot
The food is always excellent
There's so much variety even the pickiest of eaters will be happy
This is an adult crowd, I wouldn't recommend kids
Not someplace you want to come to with anything less than business casual or you'll feel out of place
It's pretty much a fashion show in here
I had a good experience, friendly service ans good food
Terrible
Bad service from the waitress and host to begin with
They messed up my reservation for starters and then gave me an attitude about it
Also, the food was overpriced, portions were small, and tasted bland
Stay away!!!
Once a month my friends are doing a dinner
this month this was the spot a table for six in the center of the room we made a meal out of 4 apps and 4 dinner courses
You know when you go someplace and the food is good
but in general (nothing really stands out as being WoW) Well they had that banana smash desert -- that was really good
we had the lamb ribs (pretty good) the duck salad (also tasty)  Price wasnt too hard to handle - Would eat there again (but i'd give it sometime -- its not a do it again next week)
Definitely well-suited for large parties ( we were 9 around a round-table), the food at the family-style asian eatery is well, ok
The calamari salad was great while the lamb ribs were fat, fattier and fattiest
The wasabi mashed potatoes were delicious while the chicken was dry
Don't miss the beef (but order two for more than 5 people)
Service is FAST so if you are dining, order entrees after receiving apps
After ordering off their Restaurant Week menu last night I would not recommend this restaurant at all unless you are fond of a LOT of noodles
I'm sorry I did not read the other reviews before going there
The lamb ribs were overcooked and full of fat
The entree had to be shared and was mostly noodles - very little meat
The coffee was very strong and did not taste fresh and overpriced at $3
50
China Grill is a very cool, NY restaurant with huge soaring ceilings and a chic look to it
It is also blaringly loud and usually crowded
The food is good but somewhat expensive even given the fact that most orders are shareable
I am sure there are plenty of other pan-asian restaurants in NY but this one is so NY that it is worth a visit
The calamari salad is a must while the grilled chicken entree was a bust
Definitely do dessert though
Good food, great atmosphere and quick service
I would not expect to hold deep meaningful conversations while dining, the cavernous rooms create somewhat deafening noise, but it is a great group place
Recently, a group of us went out for one of our friend's birthdays
Needless to say, accomodating a group of 15 is very hard in most fine restaurants in New York
China Grill welcomed us with open arms and I cannot thank them enough
The barbequed lamb melted in your mouth as did the grilled chicken
Having been to the China Grill in Miami Beach, FL, I can honestly say that this mid-town dig is superior in every way to its sunny counterpart
Delicious!
I have never had a more 'hurried' meal in my life, and we weren't even ordering from the Restaurant Week menu
The waitrons were literally asking are you done with that while we were still eating so they could serve the next course! I mean, I know they want to turn the tables this week, but my god
I dine out often, and rarely have I been more unhappy with the quality of food and service as I was China Grill
The salad was huge, but obviously dressed ahead of time, and the overall greasiness of my meal was unsettling - figuratively and literally

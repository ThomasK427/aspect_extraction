I'm a meat lover and they make the best veal in town
My favorite is ossobuco, but the veal scaloppini is equally good
My husband loves their homemade pastas
The brick-oven pizza is excellent as well
We have been comming here for years and they have been consistently wonderful
My complimants to the Chef
We were running late for the theater, so we decided to go after the theater to dinner
We chose Trattoria, because we usually go here with our friends
We love the food and the ambience
It's our favorite in the city
We had a great time even late night
I was quite nice
The crawds have gone by than
The food was excellent as always
I had my favorite there, tuna tartare and bowtie pasta with salmon
My husband had the ossobuco, which is really amazing here
The service was excellent as always
I was happy, they were as nice and friendly late night as they are durring the day : ) We had an amazing time, as always
If you want a more tranquile experience, I highly recommend it
Great ambience!
I have no idea how the previous reviews rave about this place, because the food was below average
I went here last night for dinner before a show
We chose the price-fixed pre theater menu
It sounded like a lot of food for the price
The bruschetta was stale, the salad was OK, the salmon was small and nothing spectacular, and was served with about a 1/2 cup of broccoli
My brother and his girlfriend both got the lasagna and it was the smallest piece I've ever seen in my life
The noodles looked burnt too
They said it was OK
I've been to a lot of other places that have an amazing price-fixed menu with excellent food-maybe there are better selections on the regular menu, but if you want a satifying, delicious Italian meal with good portions, this is not the place
My husband and I love the theater and are always busy and never have time for some real discussion, so we started going to restaurants after the show to exchange thoughts
Well, we usually choose restaurants close to the theaters
This time we chose this one and I tell you, it was wonderful
They have the best tiramisu I've ever tasted and they make this mousse pastery that's delicious
It was 6 of us and we had a great time
The kitchen was still open, so some of us ordered pizza, we had some wine and discussed away
We didn't feel rushed and had a great time
It's a nice post theater destination
We loved this romantic, elegant restaurant
The ambience spells romance
The cozy alcoves provide a cozy hide away spots
The viberent colors, high ceilings and homey trinkets make for a picturesque scene
Now, the food will blow you away
I had homemade bowtie pasta with salmon and asparagus - delicious
My husband had pappardelle with chunks of wild boar
The presentation was very nice
And the tiramisu was truely amazing! You should leave some room and try it
The service was fast and professional
Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeble about the wines
He made a perfect suggestion regarding the wine
We loved it so much we had him save us the label
We had an amazing time
I highly recommend it especially for late night romantic gettaway dinners
Salute!
I ate at dopo teatro last night based on the reviews here
The food was wonderful
I had the risotto, which was richly flavored with truffle oil
My mother had fettucine ragu and particularly enjoyed the fresh pasta (we wondered if it was made on the premises)
And for pre-theater, the prices were pretty reasonable
The best part, however, was the marinated vegetables on the antipasto plate
The artichokes, tomatoes, and olives were delicious
Before you order though, know that the marinated vegetables, despite what the menu says, are part of the special antipasto plate, not the regular menu one
One word of warning - the downstairs 'garden' doesn't provide the ambience you might expect
The metal tables and chairs are packed in uncomfortably, and the 'skylight' provides a view of the floor above
I'd request to sit on the top floor
I took my wife here for dinner before the theater
We had a wonderful time
She raved about her food
She had tuna tartare and the red snapper
I opted for meat; the ossobuco was exquisite
The service was very professional and friendly
We got there a little late, they rushed the orders for us
Wonderful, just a wonderful experience
I highly recommend it!
I love theather,and i like Broadway show
But i never like to eat out in the distric often because i always had a feeling that,theathers restaurant food is not too good,and they don't serve you well
I was wrong,this place was really crowd,the food nice and well presented,and the service attempt and coordiante well
the only thing suprise me was the manager ( i guess he was ) who called up our waiter almost screaming quiet loud! well, sometimes people loose control of them self
Nice job, hope they will keep up with it!
My boyfriend took me here for a special date
It's a beautiful restaurant
The downstrais skylight, indoor garden feels like an Italian villa
We were sitting on this little balcony by the wall waterfall, magnificent
The service was spectacular, the waiter was wonderful
He patiently recited the specials lots of times, as we couldn't decide what we wanted
He also recommended a great bottle of wine to complement our fish dishes
I had the striped bass in balsamic vinegar and garlic sauce
My boyfriend had the cod fish with capers
Both of our dishes were delicious
The wine was chilled to perfection and ellegantly served
The music, the ambience spelled romance paired with great food and prompt and proper service, it is a great destination for a date
I took my mom to the theater and took her to dinner at Dopo Teatro
I used to work in the area this used to be my favorite lunch restaurant
Well, the pre-theater experience did not disappoint
We had a very nice waiter, attentive, despite the fact the restaurant was busy
Everyone was exteremly nice, just like I remember from a few years ago
The food was spectacular and very innovative
My mom had soft polenta with sauteed wild mushrooms, light tomato sauce and parmesan
I had filet mignon carpaccio with arugola and parmesan
Great homemade pastas
Reasonable prices, personable staff all in a beautiful, high ceiling pre-war building

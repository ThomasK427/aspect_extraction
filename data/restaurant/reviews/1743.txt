Cute little spot with authentic florentine specialites, a nice selection of wines and reasonable prices
I came to New York on vacation from Italy
I went to a few well named Italian Restaurants around this wonderful city
I must say that Ribollita, mispelled on this site by the way, is traditional italian in everyway
The food was some of the best I've tasted since italy, everything tasted fresh and cooked to perfection
The waitstaff and bartender was friendly and courteous
There was a wait for a table, but I was seated within 20 minutes even without a reservation, for which I was not hassled for not having
I felt like I was at home there, it was a great feeling
I applaud everyone at Ribollita for keeping italian food traditional in the states
Haven't been to a place this traditional Italian since I was in Italy
Great service, and even though we didn't have a reservation we weren't given any hassle and were seated quickly
All of that's just secondary to the food though
Had the Tuscan appetizer--a perfect start for any meal--followed by the hand-rolled gnocchi--even better than what I ate in Italy and wasn't too heavy as gnocchi can often be
Also tried the veal scallopini--the best scallopini I've ever had--cooked perfectly with a side of buttery spinnach
Bottom line, forget about all the other fancier looking--not to mention, unjustifiably more expensive--places on Park Ave South and eat at a place where you'll have no complaints
This place is no frills, good Indian food
I dont think i have ever finished a plate here yet
The Portions are huge and the price is dirt cheap
cant beat a bargain like this in Manhattan!
If you ever want Indian food and are in the area go to Sirtaj
It's has absolutely no ambience, but the food is fantastic
The service is courteous and quick and the lunch specials are the best in town
We found this wonderful deli on a Sunday Morning
They make great toasted sandwiches, and it's a very nice price on the pocket! The staff were very friendly and got to know us after a few days, and didn't need to ask what we wanted
I reccomend the coffee as a greak wake up, and you get a free refil!
this deli used to be the pinnacle of ny delicatessens now its a mere shmear of its former self
last takeout order was abyssmal even inedible steer clear and go afew blocks south to katzs
so sad
The service is prompt
The pricing competitive
The food is great, but the deserts and fantastic
what's new is that 2nd ave deli doesn't seem to be so hot these days
The best things there were the condiments (ie the pickles!)
Matzoh ball soup was just so-so - it lacked flavor, and the pastrami sandwiches didn't seem that fresh
simply the best, don't mess around w/ the others
Best sandwiches, soup, chopped liver, pickles, etc
Also this place is spotless
Good service good value for the money
I know there are more 'famous' delis in NYC, but this is the best one! Go check it out, you will definitely go back! Corner of 2nd Ave 10th st
Whenever I'm not feeling so hot I get myself a nice order of their matzoh ball soup and a big old delicious corned beef or pastrami sandwich
SO GOOD
The chopped liver is a MUST - don't go their without trying it
And I hope you don't get yelled out for eating all the pickles and coleslaw like I usually do
Works magic on a hangover - great for any day or night
Its a pretty basic NYC deli
While its open 24-hours, the grill is closed everytime I go in there, and I have to special order toast if it's after 5pm
Odd
I live next door to this place
I bought one, by the time I got home the grease soaked through the bag
Greasy Pizza with canned pizza sauce, locals don't go, and there is never a wait, with good reason
Construction workers who bought pizza there sat on our stoop and would drain the grease off, 3 weeks later, grease stains are still there
In NYC there is always something better around the corner, Due Amici, 3rd Ave and 13th St
, better yet, Viva Herbal Pizza, 179 Second Ave between 1112th St
, better Pizza, healthier choices
If you're out at 2 am drunk out of your mind then Anna Maria might taste good
I forgot to mention the incredibly tacky decor too many mirrors and enough flourescent lighting to blind you, wear sunglasses, that way no one will recognize you if you happen to stumble in this dump
Everytime I go to Mike's on 2nd Ave
, I find myself waiting a pretty darn long time for a chicken parm hero
but once I get it, I'm pretty darn satisfied
I think I'm gonna order one for delivery tonite, and I'm curious to see whether the service is faster, or worse, but other than that, the guys there are helpful and cool
I guess good food doesn't = fast food
This great little pizza place was right by our hotel, and was by far the tastiest pizza I've had for a long time
(I'm not a big Pizza Fan)
Very nicely priced slices to take away, which were very handy for an late night snack!
Mike's on 2nd Ave and Mike's Due on 3rd Ave (same owners, same menu) serve by far the best pizza in the Murray Hill/Gramercy Park/Kips Bay area
Also, the spaghetti dishes are outstanding, and the dressing on the tossed salad is superb
You want something hot and tasty to bring back to your desk? Maffei's is the spot
If I am in a hurry and don't want to bring my food back to the office, I'll grab 2 grandma slices ($2 each) and eat at the counter which has a great view of the Olive Garden across the street
If I want more food and want to eat at my desk while looking at the internet, I'll get some pasta which comes with garlic knots ($6-7)
I prefer the non-tomato sauce pastas to taste better
They are really nice to all the customers too
The owner is not a nice man- he is disrespectful and downright mean
There are too many good places to eat pizza in nyc to waste your $ here
Dont underestimate this place simply on looks
The pizza is fabulous
The Chicken Parm sandwich is pretty good here
IT's really big, and they load the chicken with just enough sauce
Their grandma slices are yummy, and i've heard the pasta here is good as well
Regular slices are ok too
Their prices are basically Manhattan prices, but compared to the other pizzerias in the neighborhood, I think it's worth it
Very claustrophobic place so expect it to be really crowded during lunch
But they provide extremely fast service
The Best Slice is the Grandama slice
One of the best in the city
The regular slices are nothing special
Good hot dishes as well
In Short The ICE (formerly known as Peter Kump's Cooking School) caters to both the aspiring professional chef and the avid home cook

I registered my husband and me for a cooking class for my husband's birthday-- two months in advance
I found out two weeks before the class --and two weeks before my husband's birthday- that we were not registered because their employee screwed up- he never told me we had to pay in advance
They were unable to put me back in the class I thought we had been registered for
Very unprofessional!!!
This place provides great cooking classes with lots of food provided
The class I attended was cancelled due to the rooms being overbooked
That was the only disappointment
This should be managed better
They did give us a free one day class and a credit of $107 towards any other class
The Institue of Culinary Education has evolved out of the former Peter Kumps Cooking School - and what an evolution it has been!  I have been both a recreational and a pro-am student there for years and LOVE it
The facilities, instructors, ingredients and administrative staff are all excellent

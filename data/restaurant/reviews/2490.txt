Once you start, you could never stop
The meat are juicy and scrumptious
Every bite i take, gosh, i wish it never ends
I definitely recommend #1, #5, and #2
After you take a bite out of these sandwiches, you'll be able to understand what I am talking about!!! LOVE IT!
It's a deli
Ambience has very little value and one has to expect a good deli will get busy during lunch time
The only issues important for a deli are: quality of food, value, and cleanliness
Lenny's rates high on all three categories
Expect moderate delays during lunch time
Not only does one have to deal with large crowds of NY service people but large amount of phone orders
great sandwiches, fast and friendly service
every saturday morning we order takeout and its just good food
highly recommended
AWFUL! Produce is moldy, manager is uncooperative
Avoid this place at all costs! Go somewhere else!
The Scene A dive that's been featured on the "Late Show," Big Nick's lines its walls with photos of the famous and not-so-famous people who have eaten here
Signs describing the various dishes are hung every which way, and the waitstaff criss-cross constantly between the diner's two rooms
The Food It might be easier to decide what you're in the mood for, rather than trying to slog through the massive 14-page menu
Burgers, pizza, pasta, steaks, calzones, salads, chili, souvlaki, shakes, sandwiches, smoothies, desserts--there's not much you won't find here
Although the dingy atmosphere might suggest otherwise, the grub is surprisingly fresh and well-prepared--especially considering that most items are less than $8
Salads are huge and crisp, and burgers, including the one-pound Sumo burger, are made from 100-percent Angus steer
It's also known for pizza and Greek dishes (owner Nick was raised in Athens)
Breakfast is served 24 hours a day
i have been going here since i was a kid
it's so new york to me, what with the burger and pizza and greek food, it's like neighborhoods thrown together
big nick himself is a really good guy (he also owns nico's a block or two down) and the staff is really friendly and will remember you
it's not fancy (and frankly it's not the cleanest place in the world) but it's perfect
sweet decor - laminated quotes from restaurant reviews and photos of body builders and aspiring actors who frequent the place line the walls
the food is really good stuff, also they string twinkly lights everywhere
my favorite thing there is the spinach pie
the huge burgers are classic
the fries are thick and potato-ey
for dessert, the baklava is a sticky sweet piece of greek
when i was a kid they gave out lollipops and balloons that said, big nick is my friend
Big Nicks serves drek (for you out of towners, that means crap)
I went only once, and will never go back
The burger meat tased weird, they probably too much bread in it
Hey Nick, how 'biut using some real meat next time? Also, it took forever to get a cold bowl of soup, which was terrible by the way
There's too many good places in NYC to waste a meal at this drek palace
On a recent trip to the city our hotel was right across the street from Big Nick's
We visited there and kept going back the whole time we were there
Them menu is very large, so the choices are endless
Not the average pizza joint that you would think when you first walk in the door
They have everything at this place, and it is all great! The cheese pizza was our favorite with the large slices
Whenever we headed to Big Nick's from other parts of town even the cab drivers knew Big Nick's and how good it was
I just returned from a trip to New York and our hotel was around the corner from big nicks
we ate there and loved it so much we kept going back everything is absolutely fantastic from burgers, hotdogs, to pizza and the gyros were awesome
Anything you eat is good and doesn't cost an arm and a leg
The greatest part is big nick is always there and will ask you how your doing and whether your meal was good
the staff cut up with each other and watching them is like watching a comedy sometimes
wonderful atmosphere, busy, and small but the food is spectacular
try the port wine burger or even a big nicks hot dog with chili awesome and the cheese pizza can't be beat
yummy!!!!!!!
This place was highly rated so we checked it out
The outside tables were packed and after being seated inside I know why
The front room was basically the kitchen of a big diner
The atmosphere was one of a busy kitchen
The menu was HUGE, almost too big
Luckily we were going in for the pizza and didn't have to go through the whole menu
The pizza was good
The small size was actually quite large and fed two of us with some left over
Prices were OK
My husband and I live in Denver, but try to get to NYC a couple of times a year and on our last visit we discovered Big Nick's
It is a little dive, but the burgers were awesome!!! I had the Pizza Burger and my husband had the Grecian Burger
Both were excellent
The only downside is the menu is huge, and the waitress was kind of hurrying us along to get our order, I didn't even get to read half of what was offered, so I felt pressured to MOVE IT ALONG, but otherwise a great experience
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven when they served me my first sumo burger! My son is in NY attending college so he wanted to take me to his favorite dining place-Nick's
For those visiting NYC for the first time, this is a must do place
Dining out front was very nice
I have shared my menu with all my co-workers in Ohio and they are amazed at the selection and prices
Too good to pass over, we'll definitely be back
I can't describe how good the 1lb burger was
I was so impressed how well the cook prepared our meals-perfect!
The name says it all
The Menu is huge anything you can think of wanting it's there
The only thing not big is the actual restaurant
The Burgers and Pizza are the highlights but I love the aunthetic spinich pie
You wont be soory!
I've never seen such a long menu
Too many choices - it's overwhelming! Seriously! Well, once you make up your mind, food is terrific
Onion Soup tasted fresh, like it was made from scratch, and did not come from a can
The have the HUGEST pizza's I've ever seen!
the pizza at this place is amazing, It is always really busy there, but so worth the wait
Relatively inexpensive
Great food in a setting heaped with personality, not posh but fun and crowded
Can you at least have someone who speaks and understands English taking delivery and take out orders?! It's a constant struggle repeating myself 10 times and yelling at the top of my lungs
The food is mediocre, burgers are ok, the pizza tastes like the box it's delivered in
The only plus is that they're 24 hours
Great value, amazing assortment of cheap food, done well
Burgers have over 40 different toppings, pizza with numerous crusts
Chicken sandwich in a pita is delicious
The burger truly is the best! Delicious! The service was quirky and the place fun
Hands-down, it's the best burger joint on the Upper West Side
Big Nick's was sooooooo delicious
I had a guacamole burger, and it was perfect
My boyfriend had a burger smothered in a wine cheese sauce; once again, PERFECT
It was neat because Big Nick was sitting right next to us at the table, and if we wanted to complain, we could have, but we didn't, because it was PERFECT! Go Big Nick's! =)
Fantastic burgers, photos of b-list celebs, and great service with a smile
I eat at Big Nicks whenever I'm on the Upper West Side around lunch time

From across the table I could see her grated cheese, but it was too loud for me to ask her if was cooked or cold
I can't believe this place is rated as one of the top places to have margaritas
They don't even squeeze their own limes! They use that gross pre-mixed stuff you buy in liter bottles
In my book, that's an automatic disqualifier
The resulting drink: you know the type, sugary artificial kool-aid-like with a hint of tequila thrown in
If that's what you think a margarita should be like, then knock yourself out at TFs! If you want a good margarita, go to Teddy's or Temple bar
this place has real good margarits
especially on th erocks
great date place
the brunch is amazing
and the food is good too
This place had the absolute worst frozen margaritas I've ever had
They had very little tequila and no flavor at all
On the rocks was a little bit better
I ended up sticking to beer
The food was pretty good though
The guacamole was supposed to cost $2, but the waitor gave it to me for just $1! Plus, there were free refills, including chips and salsa
I had a burrito, and it was SOOOOOOO GOOD! Everything was perfect, except for the bartender's singing; he was very flat! :)
the food is solid, filling spicy and totally fine
what makes this restaurant, hoever, are all the fun games: Hula hoop contests, trivia contests , bingo! really a fun atmosphere and a good place for a first or second date
The food was great, service was great and the marg's
awesome! A little loud but definately a great place to hang out with friends
This place is definitely fun, but if you come, come for the atmosphere and drinks, not the food
The food is your typical cheap mexican - refried beans and cold yellow cheddar cheese
Came here on a Sunday night, but that didn't keep the people away
Smaller that I expected
Good mexican food
Music is loud
Although we didn't know any of the answers to the trivia, the bartender gaves us a shot of tequilla anyway! Great margaritas
This tex-mex themed bar rarely disappoints if you want to have a good time with friends getting wasted
The jukebox is always playing good tunes, and the patrons are never shy about getting up and dancing in the aisles, or even on the bar
They never kick you out (at least I never remember them doing that) and I'm pretty sure that the staff gets drunk towards the end of the night
The margaritas or strong and the tequilla keeps it flowing
You can always meet people, and almost everyone is wasted
Some nights it may be a little slow, but when it's bumpin' it's bumpin
The food is pretty irrelevant, as expected
I've only been to Tortilla Flats at night and I definitely recommend it
Get some shots and get out on the dance floor
Can be crowded but that's the best
Fun music, fun people
I highly recommend the bar area and the bartenders! They are fun, courteous and efficient
However, I found the wait staff to be rude and unaccomodating
I would NOT recommend going to Tortilla Flats if you wanted to have a decent dinner
Try Taco Bell- there's a better chance you'll be treated like a customer instead of a nuisance
This place is not cool, not cool at all
First of all the people that work there are totally rude
They act as if you are getting free government cheese from them
They shouldn't treat customers like that
Its not like the place is a posh spot or something
I will definitely tell my friends Not to go there!
while it might seem expensive to pay $12 for some burritos in run down spot, you quickly get over it
The place is really fun, especially on bingo nights, trivia nights, hula hoop nights and name-that tune nights
(where you have to name the song BEFORE it plays) staff is great
a good first or second date place--nothing like some bingo and tequila to break the ice!
Load up on the La Bomba burrito with chipotle sauce, guzzle a pitcher of their tasty margaritas and get ready for a wild evening of bingo
Yes bingo
Monday night bingo at Tortilla Flats is a riot! With the somewhat tacky over-the-top decor (lights and velvet paintings) and the super friendly staff you can't help but have a great time at this place
The Bomba Burritos make a nice (and cheap) lunch
They have sidewalk seating, and it's a reat, peaceful neighborhood to sit outside in
Nothing special, and certainly not authentic, but you could do a lot worse
I've eaten here a few times since there's a social/discussion group I'm interested in that,unfortunately, ALWAYS meets here
There are a good range of choices for vegetarians but they all feel overpriced to me -- I don't feel I'm getting my money's worth
It's a nice space though, and I didn't see the waitstaff as a problem (unline the other reviewer)
The service was horrible - all the waitresses were inattentive, sarcastic and gave us lip, even though we were more than polite with them
They acted as if we did them a favor by paying them to eat there
I do not recommend this restaurant
This is yet another place I'm shocked to see so highly recommended
From the outside it doesn't look inviting and inside, after trying it once, I'm surprised it survives
Maybe tourists keep it going, but surely those of us who live nearby know many, many places to get better middle-eastern food
It has a great cheap little restaurant but the bar section is a comfy neighborhood atmosphere with a great jukebox and sexy barmaids
I went to the basement bar section last Thursday
I never even knew there was a basement bar despite all the times I've been there
And they were having Karaoke
It was great
A really chill lounge and the Karaoke was just fun not like some places where you shouldn't even get up if you don't have grammy-award winning vocal chords
They have Karaoke every Thursday in the downstairs lounge at 10 pm
I will definitly be back and singing
Lemme start with this: This place was horrible from the moment I arrived
I have never waited 1 hr and 15 minutes just to sit down (let alone in 90 degree heat)
OK so we had about 15 people, but somehow they couldn't find a seat for us for over an hour
They wouldnt accept reservations either (maybe they should from now on since they can't find seats for certain parties)
Then after we were seated we ate dorito chips for about 35 minutes before we were able to even order
Somehow they forgot about a table of 15! The food came another 30 minutes later! So to sum it up we arrived at 7pm and didn't eat until 9pm! And the food wasn't all that, in fact there was no that
I ordered their steak and asked for medium rare
Apparently they had no clue what the hell that is because it came to me looking like they just got it from the slaughtering house
It was redder than hemoglobin
On top of that I got sick from it and walked home looking like a cripple because my stomach was cramping me
Their margaritas are big but weren't the greatest either
Unfornately that might've been the best thing on their menu
Oh and when we were eating their dorito chips at the start we asked for a refill
Somehow the waiter must've have got lost because the refill didn't come until 15 minutes later
How hard is it to fill a bowl with chips and bring it back? Need I say more bout how bad this place was
I have no clue how someone can go their twice
And thats all I got to say about that
The margaritas were mediocre, expensive and small
The food wasn't horrible, but just ok
The value was non-existence
and
This was the worst experience I've had at a restraunt since moving to the city a year ago
This from someone who eats out 2 to 3 times a week

I finally called to cancel b/c I wasn't comfortable
I was recently there for my sister in law's bachelorette party
I never knew it existing
We all had a great time singing, dancing on the chairs, and just partying
Can't wait to go back
Went last night for my friend's birthday
While I read many negative reviews I thought it was fun
I think sometimes we NYC'rs need to get over ourselves
Yes the crowd was a little touristy, but we had a blast! With 6pm reservations we didn't wait for our table
The food was very good for the price
We shared a bunch of things
The pasta was homemade and I highly recommend it
The pizza was very good as was the seafood antipasto
the one thing I would NOT recommend is the veal
I don't think the pan was hot enough when they put it in and the breading was really mushy and I found it inedible
Service was pretty good in regards to speed however I had issues with certain things for example waiters always handed things acorss the table instead of properly walking around the table to serve
i went there with a group of 10 people for my friend bachelorette party
it was saturday night and the place was in the middle of a huge party, and of course, we wanted to be part of it
we had to wait a little bit for our table, even when we had a reservation , but it was nothing that a martini at the bar and the good music could'nt fix right away
Food was exelent , and the service was atentive and fast
After dinner they brought a shot for my friend , with music and dancing
We had a really good time
Ill bring all my friends for they bachelorette party , even mine !!!
Great fun, Excellent food and outstanding service = Mangia E Bevi My friend suggested Mangia E Bevi to me and my brother, since we are new in the neighborhood
It was a totally chill, fun place to be at which had surprisingly great food
I was expecting an average meal and was really pleased to get an awesome dinner -- and it was pretty inexpensive too
I'm definitely coming back - especially with so many single good looking chicks dinning at one time
this restaurant has the perfect mix for a good time
I went with a group of eight friends to celebrate a bachelorette party
we had an awesome time
the food was great, the staff was friendly and efficient and the drinks were perfect
we did have to wait about half an hour to be seated but the wait was worth it, after we were in it was fun all night long!
i've gone back several times and havent been disappointed yet
I was there on Saturday night for a bachelorette party
We had 9:00 reservations but we were not seated until 10:15
There's no place inside to wait so we were forced to wait in the cold with the 8 other groups of people that had 9:00 reservations
The manager was obnoxious and continually lied to us about when our table would be ready
Reservations are required but don't expect them to honor them
They pack way too many tables into the room making the place entirely too crowded to relax and enjoy yourself
I would never go back there
i eat lunch at mangia e bevi almost everyday, i didint know about this web site before, thtas why i want to highly recommend this place, the food its very good and the staff very friendly , they've a lot of choices for lunch , even a lunch special
and if theres a party around be ready, because the music may start at any moment
my friends and i went there to dinner last saturday, and we had a great time
At first i was a little upset because we waited for about half hour, but after we sat everything was great
the food was exelent and the service was great
Then the fun began, when tamborines were passed around and people started dancing on chairs
I will definitely come back
Really good food, with a diferent choices of specials dishes of the day, great and loud music, friendly staff and awsome drinks
i can recommend it !!!
While I had fun, the food was tasteless, the ambiance didn't impress much and service can definitely be improved
I'd suggest eating before hand and sticking to drinks (extensive shots menu)
Large tables, good selection of alcohol, attentive wait staff - this place is great for groups
While you've certainly had better Italian, probably much better, the atmosphere is so lively that you'll hardly notice
It's all about the music - you start out with your basic Dean Martin/Louis Prima during dinner, but when it's time to celebrate a birthday or bachelorette (etc) the wait staff kicks it up a notch and breaks out the dance music
don't be surprised if you find yourself up on your chair!
I just want to share an unforgettable night that I had when i went to Mangia e bevi with a group of friend celebrating my sisters birthday
Since we came in, we had to wait a bit , but we stand at the bar trying one and another martini from the list (greats)
We've got dinner while we were singing and dancing on the chairs and all over
After that, everybody sang the happy birthday for her, My sister had such a great party
NO DOUBT We'll be coming back for the next birthday party
I was there with my group of friends celebrating my bachelorette party
And i can tell that it was the Perfect place for it
Great music, cool staff and incredible drinks
The whole atmosphere was proper for the situation
I recomend the place to my friends
I just want to Thanks MB for such of nice experience
Grest food for the money, Friendly service, Very nice Lunch menu Fun place to dine with or wihtout the crowd
Great music on weekends
Never in a million years would I imagine that I would attend a bachelor dinner at place filled with women drinking, partying and dancing
Although the dining is not 3 or 4 starr the atmosphere is great
The food equivalent and then some to the prices they charge
A small rest
however great for a buddies night out
I recommend it to all, probably the cheapest restaurant in Manhattan
Wouldn't be surprised if they raise their prices soon
A group of us went for lunch
The food was above average and the prices were right
As long as you don't expect too much, you'll be satisfied
People have said this was a fun place to go for a bday
it was horrifying
We waited outside for about 2 hours
in the freezing cold
When we finally got in
the seating was uncomfortable, the food was not really good, I guess for what you are paying
it was ok
But keep in mind, I got my entree before I even got my drink
which was a Sprite
after all the aggravation, I didnt want to drink at all
Do not have your bday here
if you dont want to get annoyed
If you are looking for a very reasonably priced Italian restaurant with great service and generous portions - this is the place! I have gone for lunch and dinner, and have never been dissapointed!
If you're looking for frustration and to wait a half an hour to forty-five minutes after your reservation time for a table, then this is the place to go
However, don't forget your umbrella if it's raining because there's no lobby to stand in while you wait
And forget about having a drink at the bar to take the edge off because the space between tables is so narrow that you'll be shoved by the wait staff who are desparate to get their job done
If don't mind being trapped in a packed place with no hope of a speedy exit because people are waiting in the doorway, then this is the perfect place to spend your night
And finally if you don't mind that the manager on duty is so stressed out and can't handle it that he's bullying you and your entire party, then this is the place
Although I found their food to be mediocre, the reason I'm writing this review is that I was at this restaurant last night and was appalled at the behavior of their owner/manager, who actually THREW A DRINK in the face of a young lady who was complaining about something
This place is crowded and the service is subpar, but this incident was surreal
The cops were called and the situation handled, but I can't imagine ever giving my money to this place again
It's not about the food - it's about the fun

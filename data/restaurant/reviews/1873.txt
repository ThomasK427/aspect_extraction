I had bisteca there the other night and it was way below average considering the $34 price tag on it
Also the octopus appetizer was far away from exceptional
The only thing that is good about the place is really the interior design
I went here with my friends, who was here on vacation
We were all wearing jeans and I don't know if that gave the host the impression that we were poor and could not afford dinning there
Anyway, the portions were very small
The best thing at this restaurant was the panna cotta, it was simply
melt in your mouth
A bit too dark, then again it goes with the host
I went to Il Buco for Valentine's
The food, the atmosphere and these service was amazing
The place is so intimate and nicely decorated
The ingredients in the dishes are so fresh
We had 5 course pre-fix dinner and everything was amazing
I think this is one of the best restaurants in NYC
One can go with bunch of friends and sit at one of the communal tables
It is also a perfect date spot
Listen to the waiters, they know which wine goes with which dish
Now stop reading this review and MAKE A RESERVATION TO IL BUCO!!!
I did travel to NY for years and a while back i fell in love with Il Buco
i was travelling back and forth and would not miss the chance to go there being recognized, well served and eating food i was missing around the world
Everything is just pefect for me great food an amazing wine list and most of all a group of people who really care about what they do and who really know what they are up to
Il Buco was everything that I was told it would be
A perfect romantic night
Do the olive oil tasting!
I've been to a lot of Italian restaurants, high-end, low-end, and this was the blandest food I've ever tasted
This is not Italian food
Save your money
The risotto had no flavor
My husband's pasta with cauliflower was equally tasteless
We were really shocked
The decor was great, but meal was expensive and not good
I'm in two minds about Il Buco
The first time I visited I fell in love with the ambience, and was estatic that the food matched up
That was followed by visits off and on
There have been times that the food hasn't lived up to the promise it showed earlier, but I haven't given up yet, coz every uninspired visit is invariably followed by a memorable evening which makes me want to go back again! My present recommendation would be the fig stuffed quail the lasagna with duch ragout
First let me address a few of the negative things that others have said
As far as communal tables there are 11 private tables on the main floor and only four communal tables
I might add that you are further away from your neighbor at a communal table than at the private ones as they are squeezed pretty close
The restaurant uses all local farm raised products and as for the lack of soda so what
Who drinks pepsi with a fine meal anyway
They offer a list of about fifteen appetizers that change seasonally and there entrees change every evening
With a choise of three pastas a risotto and four main dishes I think there is something for everyone
I also found the staff to be very knowledgable and helpul throughout the meal
They can explain any ingredient and very well versed on the wine menu as well
I went to Il Buco based on the recommendations here and the 9
6 score given
I was sorely disappointed
The food was mediocre
The service was poor
When asked to compare between two dishes, the server said whatever you like
The server was clearly having a bad
The Leak Risotto was good, although rich
My companions said the steak was fabulous, and even said it was quite possibly the best steak they've ever had
The neighborhood is not good
The restaurant is small
I wouldn't recommend a group over 6
We had 9 and were a tight fit
The restaurant was sweltering hot
it was easily 80 degrees in the building
I had dinner there last weekend, and the food was amazing
To be honest, I didn't even NOTICE if the service we got was good or bad, who cares about service as long as we got the amazing food? The appetizers are unreal, even if the main courses are more traditional
I want to go back again and just order all of the appetizers
Overpriced food was below average, trust me don't go there!
Loud, crowded, unconfortable, inattentive service, a menu that is creative by some standards is largely unappealing, and I like everything
don't believe the hype
WAY overpriced for bland pseudo organic food
they act like they're doing you a favor offering six crappy entrees from which to choose
truly one of the worst meals i've ever had, and by far the worst per dollar in NYC
to echo recent sentiment, risotto was just like gruel
other than cool decor inside, it's a total joke
To start off the night, we were greeted by a sycophant host who looked us up and down and seemed to have tallied what our wallets held by what we were wearing
The coat check girl also displayed a decided look of judgment and we got not a single smile until the water girl came up
The seats were uncomfortable and the wine selection was pretentious and over-priced
I had the amazingly bland, blah risotto I had ever tasted - comparable to the kind you get in a bag from the grocery store
The server's mannerisms were haughty and there was a non-too- hidden agenda of up-selling - which made our party decide immediately to spend less
To top it off the sycophant preened and fawned over others in the restaurant whom he deemed worthy of his attention
Overall a terrible experience
The water did seem fresh, though
Everything was great, thanks to the chef, it was amazing
We had a very romantic dinner, service was excellent
The octopus salad is one of the most wonderful things I've ever had
The service was amazing
The waiter had a perfect wine recommendation for every dish
It was a complete delight
I ate here with a small group and absolutely enjoyed the whole experience
The wine selection was wonderful
the olive oil was to die for
The food was fresh and the menu was inventive without having to try too hard
Italian food is best when it is fresh and simple, and the food here was so well done
Although pricey, no more so than many Manhattan restaurants, but unlike most, this is well worth the price
What started as a romantic evening ended in disgust
We should of walked out the minute we walked in
It began with attitude from the staff and just got worse
We were seated with strangers which killed the romantic mood
Communal seating should onle be in cafeterias
The food was served in small portions and my lamb was pure fat
Not one portion justified the high prices
The food looked inexpensive and tasted inexpensive
I am not sure where the good reviews come from but my guess is they have some interest in the restaurant

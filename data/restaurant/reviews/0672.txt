Great, inexpensive Thai food
A nice change from the usual Planet Thailand
Chicken Pad thai w/ a calamari appetizer is the best
It gets a little too packed during the weekend, so I would suggest a week night for this place
Atmosphere is cool
Defintely a good addition to the North Side
I loved this place
The decor and atmosphere were great
We went on a weekday with a large group of friends we were seated immediately eventhough we didn't have a reservation
The food was amazing they did everything to make our meal enjoyable including boiling the lobster instead of deepfrying it
Our waiter was attentive and very helpful with the menu
it's true, sometimes they get overwhelmed on weekends
go during the week
the food is amazing
i keep going back
the spicy dark ocean meal is awesome
and the sa-med pad thai was fantastic
the only rotten experience was the day b4 new years eve
they weren't ready for the williamsburgh folks
the service was so bad that day, i actually walked out
30 minute wait for the appetizer another 45 for the meal
then the shrimp hadn't been de-veined
depsite that, i've returned many times!! that says it all
Very visually appealing
The food was almost too pretty to eat
Great value for the buck
Food and ambiance are wonderful if you don't mind the ridiculous wait and the appalling service
The people at the front desk had no idea what they were doing but to their credit remained pleasant even with people three deep complaining about when they were going to sit
20 minutes was the wait regardless and in fact I was told that the wait would be 20 minutes on four occasions and finally sat down after an hour and a half
On top of that, there was only one overworked, flustered bartender
On the upside, the shrimp appetizers and pad thai were both wonderful and the black noodles are out of this world
Great ginger martinis and mango margaritas as well made with fresh ingredients
Based on the other reviews on this site, it looks like service is an ongoing problem with SEA
I heard about SEA for quite some time
Just had a chance to check it out last Friday
It was such a great experience!! Fun hip-scene, nice food, attentive staffs
Haven't got such things in Manhattan
Better move to Williamsburg :P
I have been to see twice
Each time I go, the realization of superb food, excellent atmosphere, and not so expensive menu, will keep me craving for more every day that I am not in Sea
After waiting nearly an hour to be seated, it was not worth it
My name was taken at the door, but no staff ever seemed to call anyone's name to let them know their table was ready
I threatened to leave and then got promptly seated, with at least three empty tables around me
The food was terrible, my basil dish was very sweet, it tasted like maple syrup
Our appetizer of dumplings was dry and terrible
The restaurant is beautiful, reasonably priced and very hip, but the service and the food was terrible
Loved the Jade Dumplings and Mummy Fish, great shrimp in clay pot
good music and decor
Sea is an amazing place for first dates, dinners with long-lost friends, group plans, or anything else
It is an amazing Thai restaurant with competitive prices, sexy decor, excellent drinks and an impressive menu
It is a little bit off the beaten track but it is worth the trek
Stop on by, sit on the swings, sip a lychee martini, and enjoy their shrimp appetizers
It is something you must go Sea for yourself
What a beautiful restaurant
What wonderful, well priced food
What a disaster of a restaurant
I am usually very forgiving of service
If the food is good I can overlook a lot of things
But in my two visits to SEA I have experienced breathtakingly bad service
The bar was slow, the food was slow, the waiters are so overwhelmed they can barely figure out what to do next
There was a plate of food spilled down one of our guest's back (with lots of sweet sticky sauce) and we didn't even get an apology
The staff seems to be trying their best, but they are so understaffed they can't begin to do their jobs
And the management doesn't seem to notice or care
Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like it, I will never be back
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends
In fact the next two days I spent raving about the food, price and ambience
I will definitely return
In fact I am considering it for my rehearsal dinner
The low ratings for Sea I truly do not understand! I was blown away by how beautiful Sea is
Interior designers will be delighted
People who have eclectic taste in music will enjoy the DJ
The waiters are very busy, but easy to flag down and quite nice
The food was great
I personally hate it when a waitperson comes by with the everything okay? when my mouth is full or I'm in mid-sentence--better to be left alone
I thoroughly enjoyed Sea
Much hoopla about nothing, really
It took quite a while for our orders to be taken from an obviously overwhelmed waiter
Presentation of the dishes was impressive, but I had only wished the flavor matched
The mussels ordered as an appetizer were slightly bitter
and a few of the mixed drinks arrived incorrectly made (and they were standards in any american bar)
It was a bit too dark, which totally made the great attempts at decorating the dishes a waste
The decor was eyecatching, but perhaps a bit too much was crowded into the space, making us feel a bit claustraphobic
Hope they ease up on trying to be the new in hangout, and devote a bit more time to service and the FOOD !
This place has got to be one of a kind
I have never seen a restaurant like this before
The Set up are soo incredible
Huge Restaurant, each seating area has its own theme
The food, you just got to taste it yourself
Drinks were faboulas
The service were terrific, Friendly and Lots of smiles and funny
Defeinetly makes anyone feels like welcome
This is the perfect place to have your birthday party or any party
Your date or friends would think your God if you bring them here
Oh INEXPENSIVE!! ( see how i can't get enough of this place?)
Great decor, smart set, superb food and the biggest surprise
a small check at the end
Drag yourself out of The City to sample what's goin on
I'll give it to Sea; the decor is pretty cool and the food was good, but the service was beyond terrible! We went into to have dinner on a Sunday evening and it was pretty empty
The waitstaff just stood around and talked to each other
We were finally able to stop a busboy and asked him to get us drinks

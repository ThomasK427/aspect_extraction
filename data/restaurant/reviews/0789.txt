It quite difficult to find a big place to have group party in midtown
and my friend recommend blue chili and it was excellent
waiter is friendly, food is dilicious and the place is cool, lovely drinks!
I went to this place recently with several friends
It is excellent place in new york city
We tried a bluechili martini and I really like it
The place was packed and the food was delicious
The atmosphere was lively, and the service was excellent
I would highly recommend the place and the food really wasn't that expensive
Decent decor, young and attractive crowd, great service
My water glass must have been filled six times
Seafood entrees were just okay
Sapporo was too warm
My guess is that the sushi is the main draw
I've been to blue chili many time
It is my favorite place
the waiter is friendly
The food is delicious, sushi is good also
perfect for party
This place is amazing! Went there few times before the show
The food is unique, amazing! Not just plain oriental cusine, but very unusual tasteful and nicely decorated piece of art! Try Malaysian crepe, its great! For dessert - their fried ice cream is the best! The ambience is great too, beautifully decorated place, very clean and very modern decor
The service is good too
This place is even good for just drinks after work (nice bar) I am going back there as soon as I get a chance
this place is great the service was out of this world
the food was top notch (so not what I expected)
The decor is pretty cool -- defentely fun if you taking a group out
it's one step off from romantic, but its great food and the prices are pretty good for the area and the meals that your being served
For someone who loves sushi, this place is a dream come true
And the fish is pretty much top notch
No grade B fish here
Reasonably priced for what you get
and the pan asian also good such as grilled sea bass and jumbo shrimp
service is good and friendly
the atmosphere is pretty hip, i'll admit that
the sushi came out in chunks WAY too big
for those that know sushi, more is NOT better
it was really stuffy in there too
i'm not sure if the AC was down, but we were sweaty by the end
lastly, our waitress forgot our order after we'd just told it to her, then she totally disappeared
we could tell the other wait-staff was looking for her
i don't know how places like this in manhattan survive
they must prey off tourists
two thumbs down
My wife and I ate at the Bluechili at the recommendation of a friend
We were very pleased with all aspects of this cool restaurant
The sauces that were provided with our appetizer were tremendous
It was a little cold outside, so we each had soup


my wife's was just a little spicy for her taste but i thought both were great
For our main dishes, my wife had the soft shell crab


HUGE portion and really tasty
I had the Chlean Sea Bass and could not get over the wonderful experience
The fish was done to absolute perfection, very hot in the middle, and was still moist


I was really in awe at how they were able to attain this perfection
A great atmosphere and good service makes this a very nice place for a casual evening out
I met a group of 8 friends here, and ordered everything from duck to sushi- and liked everything
I was not crazy about the malaysian crepe appetizer, but the shrimp and paya salad was excellent, as well as the shitake mushroom cap
The rainbow sushi platter i highly recommend as well as the mandarin red snapper
Great trandy place, with interesting lighting
don't wear any bright colors when you go there, you'll clash
Service is pleasantly slow at this chic, 2 floor restaurant
Food is good to great at bargain basement prices for this area of town
Live DJ is unnecessary, but music is at low level so conversation can be kept to normal volumes
Highly recommended
The best grilled sea bass in new york for me
lovely dessert and killer drink
I will come back again
Three words to describe this place are trendy, delicious and friendly place
It's great for a group of friends or for a couple
The ambience really sets the mood for either or
Besides the great sushi, the ICE BLLUE and HYPNOPOLITAN were delicious too! The Jersey diva will defintely visit again!
I just happened to have dinner at this restaurant because it was close to a friend's place of work
Little did I know that I would find such a beautifully decorated and intimate place
The food is reasonably priced with an emphasis on presenatation
Guys (or girls), if you would like to impress a date with an intimate restaurant bring them here
Also, try the fried ice cream
It'll take years off your life but its worth it!
if I think about fresh sushi I think about blue ribbon but recenly after I try sushi at blue chili I feel the freshness of fish as same as blue ribbon but the price here is more reasonable
sake is so good and not too expensive
my colleagues I wanted to try different japanese restaurants
the sushi here is just ok, but their pan-asian selections were good as was the chilian sea bass
we tried Hakata prefer Blue Chili for pan asian
for sushi though we like Raku much better (they are traditional japanese with excellent fresh sushi)
otherwise Blue is ok, it's nice place for dinner, cool looking place with nice lighting effects
when it's crowded expect svc to slow down
I have to admit that Bluechili was better than I thought it would be
Being in the Theater district I assumed it would be over-priced, avg
food
NOT the case at all
Sushi was above average, free appetizers, reasonable prices and a cool atmosphere to boot
A little noisy but other than that overall it was a nice little sushi joint
Definitley make a reservation, we did not but got lucky
I searched for the nice asian food in nyc and I saw bluechili was good review and then I went to try and I impressed
when you go inside you will wonder how beautiful it is
then good greeting from host and waiter was helpful the food was beautiful and test good I was recomend from waiter that the grilled sea bass is good and it s true

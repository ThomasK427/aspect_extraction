Truly awful
I gave the place an honest shot and tried everything from the roast pork (dry even though it was covered in unnecessary sauce) to singapore noodles (how often can you actually taste the uncooked curry powder)
The Shanghai dumplings were that in name only
This place is just a decent lounge with bad 70s middle America Chinese food (which no Chinese would eat)
This was the worst dining experience of my life
The service was horrible! We waited at least 15 minutes for our orders to be taken and then were ignored for the rest of the night
With all of the kitchen goof-ups (appetizer coming out before the entree and one entree coming out ten minutes before the other) you would think that the wait staff would have been more attentive
The waiter simply comped off our appetizer and then stayed away for the rest of the night--we waited an additional twenty minutes after we were done eating for the check! The food was good but definitely not worth it! I suggest ordering in
The food is delicious, not greasy at all
I've been there a few times and the food has been consistently good
Although I enjoy the sexy ambiance at the restaurant, I absolutely love No
1 for delivery during those times when I'd rather stay in with some General Tso's, the awesome eggplant and chicken/shrimp appetizer and my TV
A fake Chinese restaurant, where more has been put into the design than the food
Bench seating is cripplingly uncomfortable; downstairs area is a scary dungeon
This is no longer cute
Skate was served on the bone, with a few meager scallions
Completely bland--and too expensive
Avoid it - go to Chinatown
I love Frank's other restaurants like Little Frankie's, and I love Chinese food, so I really thought I could not go wrong with this place
How wrong I was! The space is cute, if a little too dark and cramped
The food is mediocre at best and certainly not worth the price when all the delicacies of Chinatown are only a few blocks away for half the price
The egg roll and the spicy pork dish we ordered were bland and uninspired
The only things I can recommend are the dumplings, which were excellent, but they're nothing you can't find at any Chinese restaurant worth its plum sauce
I think my dinner companion summed up my disappointment best: Number 1 Chinese? Tastes more like number 2, if you know what I mean
This place just opened last month, and its great
Good food and atmosphere
At night the upstairs closes, but there is a restaurant, bar and lounge downstairs- you should try it out!
The Scene On an unassuming retail thoroughfare is this welcoming spot with the cookie-cutter French bistro look: yellow walls, dark-wood fixtures and vintage posters
The courteous, deft service and comfortable environs satisfy a mixed crowd of Chelsea and Meatpacking locals
The Food Like the decor, the menu is classic bistro through and through
Succulent, buxom mussels can be had four ways: with classical white wine, tomatoes, luxurious Pernod and cream, or chorizo and white beans
Among the starters, salade nicoise's pungent anchovies and mellow lettuce wear a top-notch dressing
A potato galette's potatoes are dryish, though the smoked salmon and horseradish cream toppers more than compensate
Entrees are unusually nuanced: Ravioli filled with roast beef and asparagus and served in a light broth mingles fresh and earthy flavors
Desserts, like crepes Suzette, are superlative
This is one of the best French bistros in NY
Everything from the onion soup, to the mussels, to the roasted chicken to the lamb chops are nothing less than amazing
To top it off the service is friendly and always attentive
The dessets are great as well
Don't want to give up this hidden gem
On our first look at the menu, things seemed pretty pricey (for us youngsters), but definately well priced for the neighborhood
We ordered cheeseburgers and a chicken dish among 5 of us, but were very satisfied with the food and the portions
We were stuffed! To top it off, we had desserts and again, were very satisfied!
Bistro Cassis was a last minute, frenetic Zagat/Citysearch choice that disproved the argument that, as both guides have become more popular, their taste has reverted to the mean
Not only were the food and wine both excellent but the bill was probably half of what we would have paid at some of the more pricey Bistros in Manhattan
The only downside was the server, who, at times, didn't seem to understand when to shut-up and go away
The food was way below average and the flavors uninspired
We had a pricey dinner and went away feeling less than full
However, what they don't have in food they made up in wine and service
While this is not a place to go if you're looking for a scene -- this has become our new standby precisely for that reason
Great service - the waitstaff is young, French and very earnest, courteous and adept
The food is simply otherworldly
If the venison is on the menu, then GET IT!! Also, the wine list is innovative - some wines from smaller producers in Languedoc Roussion are available -ask for some creative suggestions and you won't be sorry
They can decant for you if you like
The desserts are sublime and creative
It's all about the food, the wine and the service here, which is exactly what I like in a restaurant - also it is a very good value, the prices are quite fair
Go there, you won't be sorry
The most authentic French bistro we have seen in NYC
Makes Pastis and Balthazar look downright pathetic
The ambience is great
The service is warm and friendly
Both the appetizers and the entrees are superb
In fact, it is worth going here just for the bread basket at dinner - the accompanying chicken herb pate and butter is mind-blowing! The wine list is small but excellent
The Cognacs and Armagnacs are a delight
Outstanding!
We LOVE this place
We've been for brunch three of four times now, and for dinner twice
Love it
It should be much busier but we're kind of glad it's not (selfish, I know)
Wife lived in Paris for 7 years and found the brunch breadbasket to be the closest to Parisian she's had in NYC, even better than Balthazar's overpriced one
The waiter knows us now, and the owner bought us a round of drinks once because the dessert took too long (in his opinion, we didn't even complain)
Food is outstanding and the price is quite nice
The Scene Pilar Rigon and Max Bartoli have long charmed regulars in their renovated Brooklyn diner with inspired Italian cooking and a low-key vibe
This tiny subterranean East Village space is their first foray into Manhattan, and fans can expect the same familial service and loud crowds packed into the modern red banquettes
The Food The short seasonal Italian menu equally suits casual noshing and multicourse meals
Start with the superb nine-item Miss Williamsburg Platter: your choice of three cheeses (don't miss the rare, tangy stracchino), three cured meats, two salads from the antipasti menu (the tender octopus with fava beans stands out) and one of the insanely rich soups, like sweet caramelized onion puree offset with melted Emmenthal crostini
The menu revolves around the oven in Bartoli's open kitchen: creamy, meaty multi-layered lasagna and unbelievably light gnocchi souffle excel; roast pork shank, though intensely flavorful, is occasionally dry
My boyfriend and I have dined at this lovely little nook a number of times and always leave feeling completely satisfied and as if we had just left a class-A dinner party thrown at the home of some of wonderful friends
Although all of the menu items and specials always sound tantalizing, we often end up ordering the pastaless eggplant lasagna and the gnocchi souffle
Delicious and unique! We also enjoy the variety of cheese plates and asparagus appetizer
The staff is very friendly and we have gotten into such pleasant conversations about their native Italian homes or there endeavors in NY
This is not a hoity-toity scenster spot nor a cheapy no frills joint
But it is thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended
We do wish they took credit cards though!
Miss Williamsburg has gotten notoriety from some press and a Food TV review so they have decided to overcharge for relatively average Italian food
We ordered the special capressa salad of mozzarella and grape tomatoes which turned out to be pedestrian cheese and unripe plum tomatoes for a ridiculous $14
Beware the special entrees which are priced 40-50% higher than the regular menu items which are overpriced to begin with
Don't bother with the taughted meat lasagna which lacks meat and flavor
This is an East Village restaurant with uptown prices and downright average food
Curiousity got the better of us so we finally ducked into the cozy Miss W
I'm so glad we did
The staff was so friendly and attentive and the mood was casual/romantic
We ordered their famous lasagna (mouth watering) and the crepe rings (amazing) and we're sopping up the plates with bread after this incredibly delicious and surprisingly light meal
The chocolate souffle for dessert (the best you've ever tasted, we were told) was out of this world
A pino grigio made the meal complete
So happy to have found this new favorite in the East Village
I had heard that this place had great food
not so
The dinner entrees tasted like leftovers
The service was slow

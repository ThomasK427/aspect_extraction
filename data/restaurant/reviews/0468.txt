Well, were we surprised to have our favorite meal, friendly service, absolutely beautiful surroundings
a new favorite restaurant! The food was amazing
And we're foodies, so we have eaten in many of the world's finest restaurants
The wait staff was friendly and there when we needed them, but disappeared when we didn't
I will definitely put this at the top of the list when we return to NYC in July and again in October! This is a not to be missed experience!
The attractive dinning room and kind, attentive maitre'd made a great first impression, but I fell in love at the first coarse
If it is on the menu (the waiter mentioned that the menu changes frequently to reflect what is fresh in the current market) you have to try the stuffed soft shell crab appitizer
For the main coarse my wife loved the halibit but I couldn't get away from my veal
The waitstaff was extreemly friendly; I couldnt be happier with the service
Ohhh and don't forget to try the butter marttini, it rocked! (I think thats what they called it, maybe the butterttini) It was a bit pricy but worth every cent
Flew in for the weekend from Miami and was referred by the Soho Grand
Butter went above and beyond
We waited about 20 minutes because I wanted to sit upstairs in a more formal setting, it was our anniverary
The Maitre'd granted my request and asked us if we were happy with our table and indeed I was
We were showered with champange and a midcourse, and the filet with the maitre'd butter melted in my mouth
The server acted like she enjoyed working there and was very detail oriented
I have no complaints
It was the worst restaurant experience I have had in the last seven years of living in New York City
We were there 10 minutes early for our reservation
After waiting 45 minutes at the bar (during this time three other couples who came after us were seated) I complained and I was told that this was New York City and I should get used to it
Have you ever been to Tao? one of the maitre d' assistants asked me
Apparently they are aspiring to be like Tao by seating their reservations half an hour or more late
Needless to say we just left at that point
So I decided to try this supposedly great spot for restaurant week
We sat down , decided to order from the ala carte menu since we didnt like anything on the price fixe (which ended up to be the same amount) ordered cesar salad and sea bass (which ended up tasting more like sea a**) cesar dressing was more like mustard dressing , they wouldnt give us any more bread - said they didnt have any more - it took them about 45 min to deliver us our salad- the waiter was nice and bought us a drink but seriously restaurant week or not if you cant keep up in nyc then dont be in the business
The sea bass came finally by an hr and a half later and it was exactly how i said- sea a**!! I never tasted more disgusting fish, it was very fishy - I only ate the sides and proceeded to complain to the waiter who was very nice and only charged us for the drinks we had- but i def dont recommend eating there- the service and food wasnt that great - there are so many other great places in this city =def dont need to go there
I definitely will not be returning to Butter
First, my seven girlfriends and I had to squeeze into a booth intended for 6 - we were so squished our plates touched, our legs touched and our purses were our backrests
Into our appetizer, an adjacent table became available, and we asked if we could use it, but the waiter said it most likely was being used
Weird how the table was empty for the next hour and a half
Food was good, but the dishes never came out at the same time, and each time we had to remind the waiter we were missing someone's entree, dessert, etc
During our meal, we looked like T-Rexes trying to cut our food with our elbows pinned to our sides
One of my friends complained to the host after the meal who offered a round of drinks, which was nice, but we had complained to the hostess who had seated 8 girls in a 6 person booth and our waiter and no one came up with a resolution until then? (Btw, we had these reservations for two months)
I can't help but think if my last name was Lohan if I would have had a different experience
Read the reviews about butter before I went there but I decided to go anyway despite the recent mixed reviews
The food was pricey and was mediocre at best
I went with a friend who went to butter in january and absolutely loved it
She changed her mind and said that this was the last time that she would go there
Aparently they changed their menu, possibly a new chef, and the new menu not only was small but the food wasn't nearly as good as it used to be
The restaurant is nice UPSTAIRS, the downstairs isn't that nice so a word of advice when making reservations request a table upstairs
Be prepared to spend alot of money for mediocre food and then kicked out of the bar after dinner
Oh yeah, the bartender somehow lost my credit card and a half an hour later they brought it to my table
I would pass on butter, heard it used to be great but it seems like it is over it's hayday
It was my anniversary and first time to Butter and despite the mixed reviews I gave it a try
Not only is Aaron georgeous and dressed to perfection, he knew how important the night was for us and gave a selection of tables on two different floors
No was never an option for Aaron
He gave us the whole nine
champagne, midcourse, and anniversary dessert and checked on us frequently in an non obtrusive way
All that and a wonderful wine list for 60 bucks a person exceeded my expectations and made Butter one of my fav's in NYC
We paid over $300 for a meal, just to be rushed through the end of it and asked to please leave b/c they needed to turn over our table
Not recommended if you want a nice liesurely night of dinner and drinking with friends (unless you a huge group of women who are squealing, screaming and doing shots, you're more than welcome, apparently) It was dissappointing
But the food was amazing
For over $300 for a meal, we were basically rushed through dessert and paying the check and then asked to leave so they could turn over our table
The food was excellent, but for the price you're paying, getting more people in the door should be less important than making the people that are there happy
We went to the restaurant despite the mixed reviews we had read, and what a nice surprise! The wait staff was very friendly, the service was prompt and the food was really excellent
We ordered cocktails, and they were done very well - not surprising given the reputation, but still nice
The food was great - and one person in our party ordered the steak - which nearly melted in his mouth (this guy is picky)
There were a couple of celebs when we were there, but it wasn't a big hoopla which was very nice
The upper floor is much better than the lower for dining (we were on the upper floor)
It got a bit loud and echoey, but not too intrusive
Its location is a little out of the way (near NYU)
Most people know butter as a trendy nightclub, but if you avoid monday nights you can experience it for what it really is
a great restaurant
Yeah, it's a little pricey, but i've been there a number of times and had a great dinner and good service
Any fish that the chef cooks is bound to be good, our halibut was amazing
the sides are fun and satisfying (mac and cheese with truffles, crispy artichokes) and they have a nice wine list
And whatever you do, don't skip dessert
Last time my husband and i want to butter we had the chocolate semifreddo and couldn't have been happier
if you can get a reservation and avoid all the US weekly celeb b
s
this really is a great reaturant
We showed up here late one night
The usual throng of wannabes was crowded around the entrance, but despite the fact we were almost too drunk to function, we waltzed right in
Once inside, the decor is nice, but the bar/lounge itself was horrible
We were bored senseless, and after one drink we took off
If I didn't know better I would think we must have smelled like an old fish and looked like hobos b/c this is my worst dining experience yet
We left so aggravated after the Hostess who was dressed like a real tart was rude and condescending
The Server took the order and disappeared for the entire rest of the night until we had to stop him b/c the bus boy knocked over our entire bottle of red wine soaking the white table cloth, the seats and our business suits
We sat soaked in red wine for 20 minutes eating our meals w/o the wine b/c the server saw us like that but did nothing until we stopped him
The food was mediocre at best
I brought a group of 14 there for dinner
SERVICE: Staff was polite pleasant, but service was sporadic and slow
They forgot to ask some of us about drinks, and only served 1/2 of the group
However, they were quick to correct, when we pointed it out
FOOD: Helping was small, hypical of this type of restaurant
Quality was average
Seems to be a place for the Sex in the City wannabes
Noisy
our experience at Butter was outstanding
The ambiance was fabulous, the waitstaff impecable and the food was teriffic
You must try the Butter Tini
amazing
This is a trendy place, and a great restaurant to spot some celebs
Make sure to make reservations otherwise foreget it
Overall I give this restaurant two thumbs up :)
I experienced mediocre, unimaginative food (to put it kindly) and a waiter that annoyed us, provided sub-par service and was tipped accordingly
He then accosted us at the door about the tip we left consistent with his service! While the decor is alluring (if you don't mind sitting inside a hall shaped like a canned ham), the restaurant is quite loud
I sat in the center of the restaurant and could hear the people sitting next to me better than I could hear my date
To me, the music was incongruent with the atmosphere - who wants to hear tinny-sounding Motown peppered with commercials at a purportedly hip eatery
it sounded more like a midwestern family restaurant

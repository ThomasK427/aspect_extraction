No problem
We were almost 45 minutes late
No problem
This would not have been the case at Luger's
When our food came we had 5 people dishing out the steak and sides
Also not the case at Luger's
All in all great experience, we didn't have to call 2 months in advance for an 8pm reservation on a Friday night
Just went for the first time
The food was fantastic, porterhouse was tops and while pricey was just as good if not better than most of the other excellent but expensive steaks I've had in the city
Sides, starters and desserts were all good too
Service was fine, we were seated immediately and courtesously
The restaurant is very professional looking, but good for a date also since it was so much quieter and calmer than most of the other steakhouses in the city (Sparks comes to mind as one of the most chaotic
) The high ceilings add very much to the pleasant ambiance
Did not see them much, but it seemed like there were a number of private rooms and extra spaces around the restaurant that might make it good for a private party
I live down the street so I have been here a few times
The steak for two has always been great and cooked to perfection
Everything else (appetizer, desserts, sides, and service) seems to be hit or miss
First off
all those who did not like the restuarant must be luger lovers(they're the worst)
The food at BP's is great, staff is extremly attentive and curtious, and the atmosphere is rich
A great place to take the family or the buddies from work
We had a great dinner on a snowy night last week
I introduced the bacon to a new crew and they were heads over heels for it
The steak was brilliant, the filet portion of the porterhouse was the best I've ever had, (that's saying something)
The only criticism on the food front was the wedge salad could have come from D'ags, a bit skimpy
Good luck and we hope you continue to roll as I live up the street!
Great food, awesome atmosphere and Joe makes everyone feel like family
Truly a great night out, and would definitely go back
After having my boyfriend's 30th Birthday party there, and dining about 5 times in the restaurant, I can say with conviction that it is the best steak in NYC
The space is beautiful, the staff attentive and the food incredible
Much more female friendly than the other steak places in town
Always a great meal and a fabulous evening out
I had such a great time at Blair Perrone for dinner, decided to go there for lunch
to tell the truth I was having bacon withdrawal
I ran to the table just so I could order
My friends thought I was insane, I assured them there was a reason to my madness
Just wait and see
The staff as usual was on point a true team
They seem to enjoy where they work
Lunch menu is Great, a wide variety of items to satisfy any craving,light or all out
I turned my friends to The Bacon, then ordered a variety of things salads, burgers and Steak with sides of course to have a buffet
As ususal
Awsome!!Sorry no room for dessert, our pants were too tight
I reccomend Blair Perrone for Lunch, Dinner, Snack at the bar and Drinks
Thanks gang for a great time and the Coffee Mugs!!
My family and I dined at Blair Perrone on February 17, 2006
We were impressed by the dramatic setting of the restaurant, which was very elegant with large picture windows overlooking Second Avenue
We were warmly greeted and enjoyed a great steak dinner
The Porterhouse for 2 was cooked perfectly, juicy, and had a great beefy flavor
The hash browns were great as was the selection of breads including soft, chewy salt rolls, which I love
We all had salads which were large and fresh with great dressings
Drinks were professionally made
Our servers were friendly and efficient
We also met Mr
Perrone who seems like the perfect owner of a steak house and really seems to enjoy what he does
After dinner, we had drinks at the adjacent bar
All in all, it was a great evening out and we will definitely return
Not your typical steakhouse
Definitely a place that will impress
Beautiful atmospher - 20 ft ceillings - lovely velvet drapes
All this and great food - no rushing to turnover the tables
We sat for 4 hours
Dinner was excellent - steak cooked to perfection
Very attentive staff
After my visit to the new Blair Perrone Steakhouse I said to myself finally New York City has a steakhouse that has it all
A great steak,beautiful decor, and exceptional service
Normally our choices are noisy, overcrowded and gin mill ambiance
This place is amazing,and I guarantee in the real short near future will be the best of the best in NY City
The food is great,the space is magnificent and you could actually keep a conversation with your guests
being an expert and advid lover of steakhouse cuisine my dining experience at blair perrone steakhouse was unforgettable and will certainly be on my favorite list to go to
we started at the bar, which besides being quite beautiful has a lovely warmth to it
we we're later led into a spectacular looking dining room
also being a shell fish lover we started with the seafood platter which had the tastiest assortment, besides being huge, of seafood that i've ever had
the porterhouse steak, which melted in our mouths was not to be believed
the wine list has something for every connaisseur to choose from, and of course dessert was deliciously sinful
the service was behind the best and the hosts, charlie blair and joe perrone make you feel very special in their restaurant
it was not only a night to remember but one to repeat over and over again
Wow
That's all I can say
My wife and I visited the Blair Perrone Steakhouse after seeing a mention of it in the New York Times
We were impressed indeed
We have traveled the world and have visited every major restaurant in Europe and in the States and have to say this is one of our all time favorites
The food is fantastic, the service world-class and the ambiance is amazing!   Not only are the sizzling porterhouse steaks the best we've ever had, but the seafood is also unforgettable
The hot seafood appetizer is a must
We loved the lobster tails, calamari, huge prawns, tasty clams and delicious mussels
Blair Perrone is head and shoulders above any steakhouse in NYC, including Peter Luger's
The food is better and the room divine
We'll be back!
I loved Blair Perrone
As a former MarkJoseph Steak House regular I would follow Joe and Charlie anywhere
Five years ago when they opened MarkJoseph I was in heaven, but now that I have eaten at Blair Perrone I know the true meaning of happiness
The decor matches the food exquisite
The steak melts in your mouth and I have never seen shrimp that big any where
They perfected the calamari to be the best in the world
I am not a big dessert eater yet could not pass up the Key Lime pie when I saw it being delivered to another table
The staff was professional and courteous
One thing this place has is owner management you will always see Joe or Charlie running around the dining room
My dinner companion said it perfectly This Place has Old World Charlm
You leave wanting to go back the next day!!
From soup to nuts they need to get thier act together, it must of been a ploy to get me to spend more money because they had me sit at the bar for twenty minutes while tables were open

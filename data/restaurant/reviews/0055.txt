Ignoring the plain decor, Jo-An is one of the best options for cheap japanese food on the Upper West Side
The tempura udon is excellent! They also have great vegearian sushi options, try the AAC (avocado, asparagus and cucumber) roll! I just find myself going back there again and again, and can't figure out why Columbia University people eat at Tomo when Jo-An's is so much better! Note: for some reason the sushi doesn't seem to be as good on mondays (other days of the week are better!)
In Short V
VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up
They sit and read about the exploits of a VT pizza: its deliciousness; its flaky, tender crust; the perfection of the tomato sauce and cheese combinations; the supreme pepperoni
They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT's
Some baby pizzas get their wish
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they're eaten
Yeah, sometimes the service can be slow
If that's a problem, go to McDonald's and destroy your insides
My cousin and I went there recently
We are from the boroughs, she from Queens and me from Bklyn
Her comment, which I think says it all this tastes slightly better than stuff I would get at Shea Stadium
We only order delivery from V and T because the service is horrible
The pizza is delicious, very thin crust
To describe the waiters as slothful would be polite
Not only are they painfully slow and inattentive, but they're rude to boot! The food is mediocore at it's best, and in no way does it come close to compensating for the remarkably bad service
VTs has the best pizza in New York City
It's great for kids
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!  Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy's! Much more reasonably priced too!  I take all my NYC guests to VT's
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza
Because of the delicate thin crust, take-out pies get soggy in their boxes
Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant
Their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender! Also, top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu
Waiters are slow but sweet
I've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens
This is one of our all-time favorite
Great pizza at a reasonable price, variety of pasta, salad, pitcher of soda or water on the table, kids can move around without any comments by other patrons
Many family, senior citizens, students, and little league teams! I'd call it an 'italian dinner'
The Scene Martin Scorsese has been known to treat his editing crew to dinner here, and it's easy to see why
Entering this small room--beautifully restored to its former glory after a fire destroyed the premises--is like walking onto the set of "Goodfellas
" But unless you're a friend of owner Frank Pellegrino or otherwise "connected," you might as well forgeddabout it
You'll age a year before you get a reservation
The Food The best homestyle Italian cooking and service (Menu? What menu?) in New York
In fact, you can't really say you've arrived in this town until you've scored a table here and made the pilgrimage to east Harlem for luscious pastas and chicken in vinegar and lemon
Wineturtle worked with Nick in the old Daleys Rest by Bloomies 30 some years ago and he was the best barman around in those days,an half step slower now but still sitting at his bar is magic ,watching a master mixer run this old time bar is still a treat and the staff he has trained
well they would shine anywhere else but next to Nick every one takes a back seat(alas even Wineturtle)
Some say Frank is the show,some say the food is the show,both right BUT NICK IS THE BEST!
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better
For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it
Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC
Good luck getting a table
I was at Rao's last Wed
for Meetball Night
The service was excellent, the food was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool
It's true, you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas
Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat
If you wrote a bad review, it's because you don't understand what Rao's is all about
I can't wait for the nex time
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal
The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying
If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype
Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special
it has been at least 16 years since I have eaten at Rao's
The food was unbelievable then and I am sure it is still so
If I ever get to New York again I can only hope I can get a chair in a corner for any meal
Seriously, this place kicks ass
The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant
Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot)
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up
Everything here is decent: various coffee drinks, pastries, teas, cold drinks, ok pre-packed sandwiches, etc
This is a fine cafe
What makes this place great is the space itself and its central location
I've been meeting people here for many years
The space is large and comfortable, there're almost always places to sit
There's even enough room to spread out and have an impromptu business meeting
Also, one of the most accessible public bathrooms downtown is here at Angelika
PS - My favorite movie theatre, Angelika Film Center, is attached to the cafe
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded
Drinks way over priced
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
I've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food
Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge
Yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations
Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar
The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass
Decent wine selection too
Was my favorite restaurant in Bay Ridge
Not been there in a while and went with 8 people last night
A disappointment
Manager looked upset that he had to give us a table for 8 (we had a reservation)
They like to keep tables available for their regular wise guy walk-ins
Waited a half hour, were put in a table right by the kitchen
Table was continuously banged into by the waiter who looked annoyed that we were in his way
Food was mediocre at best, service was awful
They were just trying to turn as many tables over as quickly as possible
Worst of all was the NOISE level
There was only SCREAMING, non-stop SCREAMING
Like eating in a German Beer Hall
Absolutely awful
A major disappointment to me personally
Will not be going back there anytime soon
This was absolutely a wonderful place to go two years ago
My husband and I have been going here for years
Now that we moved to Jersey, a lot less frequently - we still love going back there
No matter what, you should expect a wait, big deal, small price to pay for great food as far as I'm concerned
Get yourself a drink at the bar and make sure you make eye contact with the Matre'd!  Recommended Dishes:   Filet Mignon w/Mushroom Port Wine Sauce Spinach Ravioli w/almond cream sauce
Nothing to talk about it

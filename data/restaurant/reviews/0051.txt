The sushi bar prepares colorfully-titled rolls like the "crispy shrimpy" (shrimp, tempura flakes, avocado and cucumber)
Scoops of green tea and red bean ice cream, the only dessert options available, provide a cooling finish
Their soft-shell crab roll is to die for, and so is their spicy tuna handroll
For sushi, anything is good as they always seem to have the best fish
The fish is like butter and just melts in your mouth
Try to get there around 6:30-7ish, before dinner rush
Except for one occassion, I've never had to wait, and even that one time was just for 20 minutes
Just be sensible, if the wait is 45 minutes or longer--just have sushi there some other time, and eat something else that night
An hour wait! A host that told our group to wait outside
Why did we go? Why did we stay? I can't understand it but I want 2 hours of my life back
Terrible sushi cut into non-descript slabs; the restaurant is under-staffed; bright hospital style lighting and sushi that is no better than any corner place
Looks like there are many YAMA sushi chains in the city, but this one was bad
The quality of the sushi was bad, the way it was cut was bad, and the waiters kept trying to clear off my miso soup even when it wasn't finished
Shrimp tempura lacked crispiness and the panko was oil ladden; the sushi combination platter only had two kinds of fish, and they tried to fill it up with imitation crab rolls
I call this place a rip off
I also saw lots of empty tables but the main host was telling people to come back - I call that trying to fake an image of being popular
Very disappointing
Yama is small and usually tightly packed
The service is frantic acting but it takes a long time to get your food
I don't think the menu is particularly creative, but I've gotten solidly tasty sushi here and it's always enormous
The rolls and sashimi are well above average size, without the additional cost
If you want some BIG sushi, go to Yama
If you want peace quiet, ambience and patient service, go elsewhere
There are far more better place to get sushi, but this place gives the best bang for it's buck
I wasn't too thrill about the waitress, because i ordered sushi that was never brought out to me
Regardless, i was full, because they gave u big portion
it seems the neighborhood supports this place
it was good many moons ago, now so many say it has gone downhill
I don't go for the oversize portions - espec
if they are trying to pass off mediocre sushi nice svc is definitely lacking
my friend I agree our 2 favorites are Tomoe (but long waits) Raku in theater district (small but excellent fresh sushi/rolls)
SUM IT: save your money go around the corner to Tomoe but go early
It's NO Bond Street or Sushi Samba people
But it is better than your average (run-of-the-mill) sushi shop
I think they, purposely, make the rolls HUGE so you have to either take one ridiculously big bite or take a couple of bites and make a mess
The chefs stand behind the sushi bar watching (how you'll deal w/the situation) and snickering at you
Suggestion -- just take it TO-GO!!!
If you like BIG Warm Sushi, this is the place for you
Oh did I mention they serve warm beer as well
I heard many things about this place
I don't consider myself a true sushi expert, but I do go at least once every two weeks
Went on a Tuesday night
Not very crowded, the wait staff seemed to be in full force except when you needed their attention for something like water or tea
When we were served, the table next to us mentioned that they were still waiting for theirs, even though they were there 30 minutes before us
Food was OK
The size of the sushi will make you look at your plate before digging in, but when it's kind of warm and not the same quality throughout the presentation, you feel let down
Overall, not so good, try other places
Pretty good couple of years ago but not this Saturday
Mediocre food with rolls falling apart not so fresh sashmi
Asked for service twice and was ignored
Finally got response the third time from another unenthusiastic waiter
Left paying 10%tip
On my way out I heard one of the waitresses making an unpleasant remark about us in a language other than English
Also the waiter chased us down for more tip
Said we didnt pay enough and went on telling us we should be paying 15%
Told a friend of mine that I went to Yama, the first thing she asked was if the waiter asked for more tip
Same thing happened to her when she went
Save yourself the grief and go somewhere else where they serve better food and provide better service and dont hunt you down for more tip!
Yama always offer fresh fish
their sushi are big in portion compares to other japanese rest
mr
bowtie is always a comforting presence when you entered
it can get expensive but the food is worth it
best to go early and put your name on the list and go shopping, then return an hour later to enjoy the feast
Very big sushi, ok ambience
Sushi was fresh, just not too delicate
EXCELLENT HANDROLLS, AND VERY FRESH
GO THERE EARLY, GETS PACKED VERY FAST AFTER 6PM
menu is a bit too Americanized
Good sake, however
Carmine location appears to be more intimate
I have been eating at Pomodori for ten years and have never been disappointed
I have brought family and friends here for as long and they too have falled in love with it
Why? Excellent and friendly service, great food, reasonable prices, and a welcoming atmosphere for any occasion
And the best perk? You can actually have a glass of good house wine for under $10
Yes! One more bit of info: Zucchero Pomodori also owns Scarlatto on 47th between Bway and 8th
This is also a wonderful and reasonably priced place!
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf(ok bad joke), but you will see
The food is great!! The service well what can I say
Just go and see for yourself
Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe
goda la durata dolce di alimento!!! (Enjoy the sweet life of food)
This is my favorite NY restaurant
The freshly made pasta is wonderful and the pink vodka sauce is to die for!
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES
The brunch could not be worst !From the food to the service, everything seems out of place
But, by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback!! The Italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the UES), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner
Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions
You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare
I'm partial to the Gnocchi
Excellent experience
Service was warm and attentive, beef carpaachio was exellent (huge portion) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared
Plus they made a perfect martini
Skip Baroanda down the street (Eurotrashy, snooty and expensive) and check this place out!
Had a party of 7 people for dinner here on a busy night for the restaurant, and our meal was excellent and served with extreme consistency (all appetizers and main courses were served at the right times, with none of the dishes served at the wrong temperature)
The food was good and the service was great
Well done
We have been going to Zucchero e Pomodori for years

however, I do feel as though $25 are inappropriate for a restaurant off the beaten track in Clinton Hill
Never have I been to a more authentic Italian eatery
The atmosphere is truly amazing
The service and owners are so welcoming but you will come back again and again for the food
This little place is wonderfully warm welcoming
The host (owner) and servers are personable and caring
And the food, well the food will keep you coming back
They have homemade pastas of all kinds -- I recommend the gnocchi -- yum! Also, the chick peas with shrimp (appetizer) is divine
The wine list is lovely
If you eat here it will definitely spoil you for other Italien places!
Secretively tucked away in Brooklyn (near the C stop on Washington/Clinton), this small restaurant (seats about 60) serves great home-style Italian food
Simply delicious: very simple food but so good and filling
The relaxed atmosphere is set by the owner/maitre'd's joyful attitude
The last time I went I decided was my last
The portions were kid sized and we spent about $100 a person in cluding wine (4 of us)
It was someone's birthday and they didn't so much as give the person a free cookie
None of the dishes were delicious and one was not good at all
This place was incredible
The food was fantastic
The homemade Gnocchi was even better than mine (and I make good gnocchi) Very intimate and romantic
I enjoyed every detail, from the old drug store aesthetic and the antique medicine bottles to the simple but beautiful menus
Vini Olii should not be missed
The portions at Locanda are miniscule
Unless you have unlimited funds to order plate after plate of food skip it,or you'll leave hungry
We love L VO for it's simple hearty food, great atmosphere and fun staff
It's right around the corner but if it wasn't we would travel to it anyway
No one in NY compares
Thank you! Your next door friends
Brief but authentic menu
Owners have succumbed to fame and adoped an eat it 'n' beat it attitude
In winter lines extend inside dining area
Good saladas and chicken al mattone
Honest desserts
To avoid being jostled while threading pasta onto your fork, sit along walls
Good? Yes
VERY good? Not really
Value for money? Hmmm
If you like being treated more as a passer-by than a would-be customer: go!
Atmosphere and service is informal, but unique
Portions were perfect
Food exquisite
We took the waiter's recommendation on wine and apertifs
Awesome
Two of us spent $80 for the best overall dining experience I've had in the 5 boroughs
(Daniel and River Cafe were great, too, yet with Locanda Vini and Olii there was no guilt and buyers remorse from the cost)
It was empty on a Saturday night at 7:30, then packed out at 9:00
I come here again and again because, hands down, Locanda never fails to impress me, or those I bring here
This is absolutely my favorite restaurant! The food is fresh and inspired, the wine tastings from heaven, and the staff treats you like family
While the atmosphere is slightly quaint, the food was not good at all
The tomato sauce on the gnocchi tasted like it came from a can--without a single embellishment
I love Italian desserts, but of the 2 we tried both were dreadfully bland
The pasta with anchovies amazingly needed salt, and when a busboy was adding the grated cheese I requested to it the waited had a fit
He told me that they did things the traditional way and cheese on seafood was not recommended
Wow
And I thought my food was MY food! Overall, service was slow, seating crampped prices were high for the area
I'll never go back
The reason to come to Locanda is not the food, although it is the best Tuscan Italian peasant cuisine in the borough of Brooklyn
The real draw is the service--the servers remember your name visit to visit, even your favorite Sicilian wine or whether you generally start with mixed olives
Fast for a day before you go so you can sample a little bit of everything
This is real Italian food like you get in the old country (or so I'm told)
And it's good, if a little heavy at times
The menu is nice and varied--the appetizers are great for sharing, so you can order a few for a group and pass around
And the design is cool--it's an old pharmacy with lots of antiques and kitsch objects on display behind the medicine cabinets
The family who run it make the place what it is--they certainly have an original style of service, even if it can get a little overbearing at times
Watch out for the owner, he's a character
In Short ChipShop brings traditional British comfort food to Park Slope with a unique blend of punk-rock aesthetic and kid-friendly appeal (there's a $5 kids' menu)
The takeout-only counter around the corner is perfect for on-the-go eats, but the casual dining room is a comfortable spot for chowing down on fish and chips, shepherd's pie, Welsh rarebit and Heinz baked beans
So I called the Chip Shop at 8 and ordered fish and chips
They told me it would take 40 minutes
An hour later I called because my food wasn't here yet
They told me the delivery guy was 2-3 minutes away
30 minutes later I called and cancled because the food still wasn't here
This is the second time this has happened
Also, they never apologize
When I canceled they said oh no problem
The hype made me trek to this great fish and chip shop
It sounded cool enough, so why not? Each of us ordered a different kind of basic fish and each was mediocre at best
The batter was not very tasty and Mc Donalds makes better fries
I said I would MUCH RATHER eat Long John Silvers' fish (everything tastes way better and it is about half the price) than theirs
Save your dough and go somewhere else
Vintage in the city made the best fish and chips Ive had, but I dont know if its on the menu anymore
When they first opened the food was incredible, the service too! I mean I would eat there at least twice a week, until I weaned myself off
I recently stopped by and was surprised how just changing your cooking staff can be deadly, how? Now the food is just okay
nothing to jump up and down about at all along w/ an indifferent waitstaff
Ginger
Sure, fried food isn't necessarily good for you, but man, nobody does fish and chips like these guys
All their food tastes great, especially the Chip Butty (a french fry sandwich) and the friend macaroni
The various English deserts and beers are also fantastic, and the curry shop next door is surprisingly good too
A chip butty is buttered roll with chips inside
Sounds like a heart attack waiting to happen but it's super delicious
Every meal I've had there has been great
I know I should eat healthier but ChipShop makes you want to cheat
Plus, they have fizzy Ribena and drinks you'd only find in England
The wait staff is friendly and courteous and the food is cheap
A joy from top to bottom
I am proudly half English and I felt immediately at home here
And the fish and chips was so fine I ate without a word--extremely generous portions, fresh, crisp batter and flaky white meat
Incredibly good chips too
I love the Brit atmosphere and the waitstaff is so friendly and welcoming
The only downside? Finishing my meal

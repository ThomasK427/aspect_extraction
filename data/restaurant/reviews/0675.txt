It's perfect for a date or hanging out with friends
But the best part is the lounge in the back
If you're lucky and there's not a private party going on back there, you'll get a chance to really chill out
The Scene It's as close to Paris as the F train will take you
Smiling waiters greet regular patrons with kisses on both cheeks; French pop fills the air and rich aromas from the kitchen meet you at the door
Reasonable prices keep a stream of customers waiting in line outside
The authentic bistro fare lures them back for more
The Food Luluc's affordable, French-inspired menu offers something different during each meal
Pancakes, crisp on the outside with a sweet, melt-in-your mouth center, rival any breakfast special on Smith Street
The tangy, grilled tiger shrimp salad, with asparagus, white beans and a lemon vinaigrette, makes a great lunch
Dinner highlights include succulent salmon fillet, drenched in roasted tomato shallot sauce and grilled hangar steak with light fries and caramelized onions
Save room for the piece de resistance, a subtly sweet, berry-topped creme brulee
LuluC has consistently delicious brunch (of note are the pancakes, salmon eggs benedict and ANY omelette you please) not to mention they make a mean Bellini
Let's face it
any place that makes a great breakfast and serves wonderful alcohol to accompany it has got to be pure genius
All the egg dishes are served with a small salad and fries and the fries are rapturous
I almost hate to give this place such a good review b/c I don't want more competition for a table!
Service was excellent, all dishes were excellent
Getting the check was a bit of pain, but this is part of the atmosphere in a French place, right?   Pulled pork sandwich: yum tiger shrimp appetizer:yum  I will be back
A friend and I went for dinner, the host was rude to us as we walked in, we stayed because the decor is charming and we wanted french food
Appetizer and wine was fine
The entrees were served cold
The steak frites was replaced(20mins later),a lobster entree(actually a small tail and corn tamale stuffed head) wasn't fixed, they took it without asking if I wanted anything else instead, and it was useless to try to explain why I was unhappy with it
When we received the bill they wanted to charge 2/3 of the price for the uneaten lobster
The host wasn't happy when I protested the bill and we were asked to never come back
Frankly, why would I?
Cafe Luluc is a gem
The food is tasty and original, the service is unbeatable and the environment is relaxing
I've eaten there nearly a dozen times within the past year
It's the first choice when my boyfriend and I want to have a late Friday dinner
I'm in love with the mesculun salad, which has a sweet basil dressing, and the well-seasoned veggie sandwich
My boyfriend is addicted to the steak, which is always cooked the way he asks, and the huge pile of accompanying crunchy fries
Beware, however, of the cash-only policy, which the cafe's owners implement at their other Smith Street locale, Cafe Banania
The ATM across the street must be making a killing
Which is consistantly excellent
The prices are always right (and under $10) - the Gravlox Salmon Benedict is the real winner on the brunch menu - always fresh, with a great tasting hollandaise sauce
Don't order a Bloody Mary from the bar though - they're watered down, over-peppered and devoid of any taste
Blah
I like this tiny little yellow place
It makes me feel good
The food is yummy (pulled pork samich is fab) and the garden is beautiful
Surprise find: one of the best burgers in the area!
The food was SO good!!! The environment was great, warm and friendly
I reccomend the steak for those of you who aren't vegetarians (trust me!)
Even the tiger shrimp salad and the creme bule was good from the beginning to the end of the meal
The Scene It's all in the family, and this second-born spot turned out much like its established older brother, Frank
Candlelight flickers across three spacious rooms filled with the flea market charm of framed Italian prints and yellowing photographs
Crowds of locals mull over late-evening dinners--slowed by hip service that's more fun than fine-tuned--and take in the warmth of open kitchens, or cool beneath vine-tangled ceilings in the garden room, where curtain-draped doors unlock in the summertime
The Food Any in-the-know East Villager will tell you it's all about the pizza
The genuine 12-inchers--cooked in a handcrafted brick oven with lava from Vesuvio--are dense and crisp, topped with gobs of mozzarella, curled-edged pepperoni and specialties like smoked ham
Fresh ingredients mark the other homemade recipes, from broad raviolis du jour to the sage-seasoned wood-roasted chicken with nicely browned but basic mashed potatoes
Conclude with a perfect tiramisu
The truffle pizza, Monte Pulciano wine, brilliant service and freaking hot stud/manboy waiter named Dallas all conspired to create a flawless evening! Wish I was downtown more often! Run don't walk! Charming environment, crowd and neighborhhood as well!
The best tiramisu cake
The pizzas are quite inventive
The bar was noisy but a good place to meet people
I'd go back just for the tiramisu
Mostly come for late lunch, and I'm sure service etc can be quite annoying in the evening, however, there aren't that many good lunch spots in NY, and if you want to truly feel as though a long lunch could be part of your life, this is where to go
Plan to go with someone who's company you actually enjoy, make sure you have some hours or so to spare, order any salad, share the pizzas, get some good wine -and although pasta here is the way it's suppsed to be - al dente, sparse on the sauce etc, depending on the season I prefer to have that later in the evening (especially the spinach gnocchi w/gorgonzola
)
As you enter skip the first room and go left (to the front), and you're ready for some quality time!
What happened here? I used to love this place and wow
its no good anymore
I cam with a party of eight
They made us wait until everyone was there even though six of us were, which makes no sense
We had a reservation so the table was not going to be used by anyone
The entry way was very crowded so we just stood there until we finally prodded the hostess to let us sit down
We were seated at a table for six so we had no room and I sat in front of the kitchen window with waiters and bus boys knocking into me the whole time
The waiter was ok but too busy
The food was good but the service was hard to overlook
I have enjoyed many meals at Lil' Frankie's, but recently the food has become a joke
The other night I ordered papardelle allo scoglio and wanted to laugh when it was set in front of me
The sauce was like tomato juice with a few pieces of basil thrown in for color
10 rock shrimp does not a scoglio make
For $17, you think they could manage to throw in a clam or mussel or two to actually make scoglio what it really should be
I would have sent it back if the server had actually come around before we were finished eating
My friends' meals didn't fare much better
Empty water glasses
Empty wine glasses
Hilariously bad bar service
Watching the server chat with someone for 10 minutes before putting in your order
Waiting 15 minutes for a check
This is just too bad, too bad
I took my wife here after we got back from our honeymoon in Italy and feared that it just wouldn't live up to the delicious food we'd been eating for the last three weeks - but how wrong I was! This place is wonderful: the pizza delicious, as was the chicken my wife had, and they have a great wine list
Our server knew exactly what he was talking about, had a great sense of humor and very attentive to our needs
And the candle light definitely adds to the ambience
A group of about 16 of us strolled in here last minute around 7pm saturday night
They were friendly, just asked for us to wait about 15 minutes, no problem
The staff were very friendly, the prices were relatively average, not bad, and the food was great
I had the skirt steak special and it was great
Eating off of other's plates, I tasted the pasta, potatoes, and of course the pizza (very authentic thin crust Italy style)
The bill after all that (granted no one really had any alcohol, just soda/water and I had one glass of wine) was $250
around $27 a person
not too bad for good food and service in the city! Oh, and the music was NOT Frank Sinatra or classical, totally rockin' vibe, way cool to me
This place is fantastic
The food is AMAZING - the butternut squash ravioli blew my mind - the staff is knowledgeable, the atmosphere is great and so is the wine
Next time you're craving Italian, high-tail it here or Supper
If you love good food and good wine, and don't want to spend a million dollars, I guarantee you'll love this place
I had the pizza which was fantastic! I also started off with a buffalo mozzarella which was equally excellent
The place was a bit busy when I got there so we ate at the bar

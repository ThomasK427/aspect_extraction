My company loved it
The food was amazing as was the service and the atmosphere
The creamed spinach was top notch and the steaks were the best I have ever eaten
My boss was thrilled with the outcome
My husband loves steaks
He has taken me to most Steakhouses in New York City
I really enjoyed my visit at Frankie Johnnie's because there were options there for me too
The scalops were fabulous and he really enjoyed his porterhouse
While in Manhattan on a business trip, I decided to take the advise of a hotel worker and check out Franky Johnnie's for what I was told was to be an excellent place for a steak dinner
Boy was this good advise as this was quite simply the best steak I ever ate
After partaking in a rather expensive but tasty Rum Coke from the bar I ordered an appetizer (house salad) then ordered the Lyonnaise Potatoes and Grilled Mushrooms to accompany my Sirloin - which I ordered Medium
When the steak arrived, I was pleasantly suprised to have the server reach across me and cut my meat for me
(he only cut the meat away from the bone, but it still suprised me)
Once I cut into the steak I was in heaven! Well worth the $70 I expensed to my company
(sorry boss)
The service was fair and the food OK
For the prices, I expected much better of both
The best thing about the place was the decor, but not worth the trip for the price
Youll do better at Keens around the block
I work in the area and have been looking for a new spot - I found it
Great bar and my friends and I sat down for a steak when we got hungry
Great service
Frankie Johnnie's has always been a staple in NYC now at its new location on 37th street they thrill us yet again
The steak is always fantastic along with the service
You are pampered from start to finish
I loved the crabcakes! The chef came out to talk about his creation with me when I complimented him
I loved that
I ate in on the second floor in front of the window and the service was great and the food was awesome
I am a history buff so I went when I heard it had been John Barrymore's house
I will go back with my friends before we see Drew's new Movie!
I was amazed at how much better the steak was here than other popular -- and more expensive-- steakhouses
I loved everything I tried, and the staff couldn't have been friendlier and more attentive
It's a great place to go before or after an event at Madison Square Garden
I highly recommend it!
I wanted to write in because I had one of the best dinner experiences at Frankie Johnnie's
The food was to die for - my mouth started watering the moment I walked in, and the decor, atmosphere, and overall experience was sublime
I recommend to anyone who has a craving for steak, or a good hearty meal, in a setting that is lush and decorous, to go to Frankie Johnnie's and enjoy yourself
The service was excellent - You must sit in the BARRYMORE ROOM
The food was so great I want to eat there all the time!

So where do we go wrong? Well $7 for dog and fries and the fact youd have to eat at least 2 orders to even come close to feeling satiated
Still though gotta love the dawgs
Try the Top Dog
Our office has ordered delivery from the 23rd street store several times
The first experience was fine, though very slow
Subsequent experiences have not been so good - the last two times the orders were very incomplete - or just plain wrong
Today, after waiting over an hour and a half they called to say they lost our order, sorry
Save yourself the time and aggravation and go there and wait online for a long time for a hot dog - they are good - or order delviery way before you are hungry
or my recommendation is to order from somewhere you can depend on
The hot dogs here are creative and delicious
I liked the great dane, but the size of what you get-for the price you have to pay, for everything here, is anything but great
And the service is even worse
I've been in this place for lunch--before the rush--so I'm the only person in there
Even though there are four people working back there and no other customers it takes 15-20 mins to put together a single hot dog
What's the deal? The service just sucks
I'd still recommend giving it a try because the food is good
But it is expensive for a tiny hot dog and a few fries with a little soda
I would need to eat at least two combos in order to be enough to eat(and trust me I'm not fat), but that would cost close to $20


for two hot dogs!???
Amazing variety of dogs and other treats with such inventiveness and attention to detail in their preparation
The tang and bite of the Great Dane is unrivaled
I agree with the others that say the folks here clearly love what they're doing and have an amazing product
5 stars for cheap eats
The french fries are reminiscient of McDonald's, but greasier and with less flavor
And why do they serve cold hot dogs? Sit at one of the bar stools along the wall and your nose will be 4 inches from the wall
If you come with a friend, sit sidewayts and face eachother inorder to releive the claustrophobia
The prices are amazingly high
The service was friendly and the blue light soothing, but I suspect that is to take your attention away from the fact that you just spent $22 on subpar hotdogs and soft drinks for 2
I left disappointed and searching for a Gray's Papaya
Good veggie dogs and a lot of choices, but it's a little pricey ($19 for 2 dogs, 2 drinks and a large fry)
The dogs were also a little on the cold side
Don't think I'll be going back
Great place for hot dogs, even if you do not eat meat- they have vegie dogs too
Large selection of toppings or you can go basic
Good, not great frites, desserts and interesting alternatives to hot dogs
A must try
this is my neighborhood hot dog place
when i'm craving a hotdog and i'm too lazy to make my own, i walk over to f and b
all their hotdogs are very tasty and it's tough to decide which hotdog to get
for most of the hotdogs you can get them vegetarian
also don't forget their frites
their sweet potato frites are delicous, they don't need any of the variety of dips/sauces they offer
these are gourmet style hotdogs not the kind you pick off street vendors so they are somewhat expensive
they offer some good belgian/european beers
Dogs are great
Extremely tasty and so many options to choose from
Definitely a step above Gray's, but you cant really compare the two
Service was great, and the girl at the counter was very friendly
The store is a little tight, and you may have to fight for a seat, but it is worth it after a night of cocktails
Everything tasted very fresh and very hot

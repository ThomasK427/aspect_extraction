Thankfully I got a seatat the actualbar andordered mydinnerthere
theONEthing I will say isthat theBartenders were morethan nicecourteous, foodwas deliveredpromptly - butI've-had much,much,better steak and much,muchbetter fries at 2dozen otherplaces
Why all the fuss? How on earth did this place get nominated for Best of anything? It's at best AVERAGE
Nice decor - but the place is so crowded and noisy you can't enjoy it
There are other French places in the city that aren't as crowded that have a more European feel and better food
There are also multiple places in Connecticut that are far superior to this place
The only way I'd go here again was if it was my friend's birthday and they had their heart set on going here
Otherwise, BEEN THERE-DONE THAT-GOT THE T-SHIRT
I've tried breakast and dinner and it is always a great experience!! Excellent cuisine, a place that easilly makes you feel in Paris, the staff is friendly and efficient and
sudddendly you are having dinner right next to some rock or movie star
Every time I'm in NY I've to go there!!
I have been there every time I visit NYC
The food is great, try the warm goat cheese tart, YUMMY! Good scene for celebrity watching and great wine selections
Friday's are great for a late brunch and be sure to try the special for that day
boullibase, best I have ever had!
The to-go section is small, but the coffee and donut we had was great
We had a pretty late reservation for brunch (3pm), but we still had to wait half an hour, even though we had reservations, and on top of it, the hostess was rude when we asked how much longer it was going to be
We get seated next to super-tourists, outfitted with fanny packs, who are actually taking pictures of the place and of the people in it to say they have pictures of real New Yorkers
Our waiter was beyond rude, to the point in which another table actually asked him why he was in such a bad mood and inflicting it upon the customers
We waited forever for our orders, our drinks came out AFTER our food, we never got refills on water, we had to ask like three times for extra dressing, and our waiter was rude
The whole experience was horrible
Inviting, fun bistro
The food is outstanding and the service excellent
It's especially popular with locals
The goat cheese onion tart appitizer is out of this world
I've never had an entree that wasn't fantastic at Balthazar
I have been a regular for the past 2 years, and the food has been superb throughout! If the service is ever spotty, it is quickly forgotten as you soak up the great lighting (suggest this spot for first dates, ladies!), friendly staff and the occasional celeb
This was one of the first restaurants I came to when I first moved to New York, and it hasn't failed me since
The steak frites are the best in NYC, in my opinion
A great selection of French wines by a young, talented sommelier
The trendiness has given way to a more loyal but still stylish crowd, which always provides fun people watching
The food and service can't be beat
Dinner and brunch are equally fabulous
Always a treat
Always make a reservation well in advance if you aren't a celeb or supermodel
And try the goat cheese and onion tartlet
:)
The best best best crusty yummy perfectly textured bread ever
Get some real butter, lightly salted and slather it all over every delicious chewy bite
If you are visiting and are full on the city's wonderful restaurants, get some to eat in the car on the way home
My boyfriend made reservations a month in advance in order to get a spot here
Though we made these reservations, we still had to wait a long time before being seated
The restaurant was so crowded and loud, we couldn't barely hear each other
The food is definitely overrated
All weird types of fish
He ordered a chicken dish which was super dry
The best part of the night was the espresso martinis
Brunch service is terrible! Arrived at 11:10 and told we had to order by 11:15 for brunch (although bruch is advertised to 11:30)
After ordering, our waitperson returned to say that our tea would take some time because they were busy
When it did arrive one of the cups was dirty
Brunch for one person arrived and it was only after asking (after 10 min) that they brought brunch for the second person
The people next to us also had problems
One order was wrong and they, too, had to wait
They took it in stride as they have been to Balthazar before and said it's typical
I prefer restaurants where service is important, too
PS If you check your coat, you will be reminded there's a $1 tip when it's returned -- although I would normally do this I've never had a coat/hat check person ask for it outright
I took a friend from out of town to Balthazar and we were both delighted
The onion and goat cheese tart is delectable as were the salads we shared
Going to Balthazar would be incomplete without, of course, several glasses of wine
Although the restaurant became noisier as the night went on, I found the ambience to be perfect for the mood
Don't forget, of course, to make a reservation!
Lunchtime on the Tuesday before Christmas, and Balthazar is bustling with energy and people-talk! We had reservations (thankfully!), but we still had to wait until half-way through our second drink at the bar before being seated
We can't complain, because the atmosphere at this golden-brass restaurant is truly electric
It felt at that precise moment that this is the only place in New York where you should be! Felt the menu could have more choice
However, me and the girlfriend both chose steaks and fries, simple food that really were delicious
My starter of cold seafood salad was refreshing and tasty
Service was good (though our waiter did look a little devious for some reason)!, but the atmosphere is what really was the best part of this place
Definitely recommend Balthazar
Balthazar is one of my favorite restaurants in the city
It is the hustle and bustle of this busy restuarant that eminates New York City
Of course it's not the place to go to sit down for a quiet meal in privacy
But it's always fun, lively, and loud
The food is just good old french bistro style
My favorite is the duck confit! and I always stop by the bakery for a nibble and coffee when I'm in the area
Seems only on Friday night, but it was un-believable !! I was a tourist in NY, and a French restuarant waiter highly recommended this place
Extremely awsome! Also the service was perfect
since it's opening ~ 7 years ago, the Zar hasn't waivered in the consistency in its fare, french fires are excellent, croque monsieur very good, cold bar has a good variety - don't recommend the Royal, a la carte is the better bet
The only thing I would change is the seating tight
If you get there before 11am, most likely there is no line
But I actually find it a little less fun w/o the noisy crowd and the line outside (as long as I am not the one in line
)
After all, it's a brasserie so crowd lifts the hype
I've been a long time brunch goer here
I've to say brunch doesn't seem to be as top notch as before
I hope it's just a temporary observation
We blew over $200 here on a late night Sunday, but it was well worth it
It's a bit noisy AND pricey
but after all these years, Balthazar still rules
We had some great oysters (on a Sunday, no less) and steaks
fantastic! Our service was quick, professional and wonderful
I was a bit skeptical going for the first time (I'm not one for trendy restaurants), but we had a glorious time
If I could afford it (financially AND belly-wise), I'd be there every week
Delish!
Okay, maybe not in its quality, but the atomosphere definitely seems manufactured
The look is nice, but somehow it seems they tried too hard
The food was good, although it was not delivered all at once
My omlette arrived last, perhaps the waiter forgot to submit the order or the egg station was slammed that day (it was brunch)
Oh, and they have a bathroom attendant, something I hate and will affect my decision of whether or not I will return
There is just something creepy about a guy turning on a faucet for you
The prices are HIGH, so be forewarned

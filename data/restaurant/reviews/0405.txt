I enjoyed the service and the fact they were flexible about water pitchers for big groups as well as bill-splitting
Recommended for small groups and tapa craving foodies
In the past, Euzkadis tasty Basque cuisine has somewhat outweighed the ineptitude and horrible manners of some of the staff
This weekend, the rudeness level was by far the worst we have ever experienced in any restaurant, ever
Our first server was reasonably good, even if too rushed for finer details such as mentioning the specials
Our party of four ordered a selection of appetizers to share and four entrees
Both courses took a very long time to arrive
No problem
We were enjoying the company of our great friends over good wine
Shortly after our plates were cleared and the dessert menu arrived, the other waiter-host came to our table and asked if we wanted dessert
When we asked for another minute to decide on desserts, he shrieked a horrified Pleeeeaaaase! I have to have your order this minute! We need your table for the next seating
We had made our reservations well in advance, arrived on time, and they had made no mention of limited-time seatings
Our party had already spent $65 per person on food and wine during the two hours we had been there and were about to order desserts, so we certainly werent freeloading on their real estate
A really unpleasant experience, and just a more extreme example of the underlying hostile attitudes that weve experienced in smaller doses at Euzkadi in the past
We regret giving them another chance
A few girlfriends and I stopped here on a Friday night for some tapas and sangria at the bar
The ambience is very warm and cozy inside; perfect for a mellow evening out
We let our bartender order for us and everything was wonderful
Definitely try the goat cheese with honey! yum! We were only going to stay for a few hours but ended closing the bar down (thanks to the constantly flowing drinks from the bartender)! Definitely an enjoyable night and hope to come again soon
I chatted to the friendly barman; I drank sangria; I met a cute girl at the bar--what else can a man ask for in life?!? Highly recommended for a warm, relaxed atmosphere
I love Euzkadi! You can go in and have a quick tapas and beer at the bar or go with a group and make a night of it
The atmosphere is as amazing as the food
Probably the only NYC restaurant I could recommend to just about anybody and know they won't be dissapointed
Went here with a group of 7 people
Although the place is a little small and can get crowded, the atmosphere and service are great and make it very enjoyable experience
The dishes are made to be shared
For a group, a bunch of tapas and a couple of entrees are more than enough food
The chorizo w/ pine nuts and raisins is fantastic, as are the fried goat cheese balls w/ honey and the fried fish fingers
The pork chop entree is great as well
The owners are very hospitable and very friendly
Overall, this is a great date spot or a place to have a low-key Saturday night dinner
This is my favorite place in the city
The food is delicious,the atmosphere is great,the art work,the people,the music
The place is kind of small,but the environment is fun and fulfilling
My favorite dishes are shrimp appetizer,paella and yesss flan
Despite having a reservation, our little party of four was kept waiting for 45 MINUTES for glasses of WATER
The lone waiter was completely flustered, couldn't remember our orders and brought us the wrong food multiple times
The menu does not accurately explain the dishes, and you may find yourself with something you definitely didn't bargain for
Top it all off with a LOUD crowded dining room and inexplicably nasty glares from the two 'hosts' after politely asking to add a fifth to our party, and you have a dining experience that leaves to be desired
I would NEVER go back and I'm warning all my friends about this pit
Went here with my boyfriend (who is from Spain, but not the Basque region) and we had a really nice time
The portions were smaller than expected, but the taste certainly more than made up for it -- and believe me, he's a picky eater
The atmosphere was really nice and warm, and the waitstaff were perfect -- not overbearing, but attentive and friendly, despite the overcrowded restaurant being at max
capacity
They even read minds -- my BF said at one point, The music is too loud, and one second later it was turned down
Now that's service
Definitely try the Basque cake if you go
Simply one of the best Lentil Soups In NYC,Tuesday nights are highly entertaining!!!!
Euzkadi is the cutest little basque restaurant
My boyfriend and I live in neighborhood and have been impressed by the fact that every time we walked by the restaurant was jam-packed, so we decided to try it out
We had a most romantic, cozy time
Setting is intimate, great music, attentive wait staff, delicious food and wine
Very good value for your money
I have been to Euzkadi twice with groups of 8 people or more, once with a party of three
The groups were harassed into leaving after 2 hours (Waiter walked around to each person and asked us to leave)
I decided to give the restaurant another chance with a small party of 3
While giving the waiter our order I requested that we keep one menu
I was informed that I had to place my order in entirety the first time and was not permitted to keep a menu
We had been there for approximately 50 minutes and had our desserts/coffee for about 5 when the waiter came over and asked us to finish up so they could seat someone else at the table
Needless to say I was close to throwing my still steaming coffee into his face
I managed to restrain myself and we simply left
So
we were having a usual girls night out when we happened upon this really amazing tile mosaic on the otherwise blah East Village sidewalk
Euzkadi? The menu seemed pretty cool so we went in for just a small bite and drinks not planning on staying too long
Well this place is super cozy, the food and service are good and the sangria and music kept us there all night! The only thing that we would add to this place is more drink options
I'm not a big review writer but we just wanted to give credit where credit is due, thanks for the excellent, crazy girls night out Euzkadi! We loved it!
With nothing to do on Tuesday, my friend and I pick this place from citysearch
com
This restaurant thoroughly impressed us
We arrived at 7:00PM and there was live guitar flamenco music playing
It livened up our Tureday night
The food was great
Highly recomment the Trout dish and the sauteed mushrooms
The only disapointment I would say was the service
Our waiter was a bit indifferent and unamused
Overall, I would go back again
I'm going to be honest here
I rarely venture down to the East Village
I am an Upper East Side gal and I usually stick to what I know when it comes to food
I had some friends come to visit from the South and they wanted to try something different
We decided to hop in a cab and go down to the village
We stumbled upon this lovely and enchanting restaurant and decided to give it a try
The atmosphere was very lively, yet soothing in a way
The food was delicious, I got the mussels and the lamb, both were cooked to perfection
My weekend guests all raved about their meals as well
Our waiter was knowlegdable and friendly and even was patient with all our southern belle craziness
We look forward to our next meal here!
We ordered a bunch of tapas and appetizers, including the duck meatballs, the grilled shrimp, pork skewers, bacalau fritters
The best ones were the duck meatballs and the shrimp, which were amazing
The free bread with the seasoned topping that they provide is also delicious
The other tapas/appetizers were good, but nothing memorable, and the calamari appetizer was tasteless
I did appreciate the fact that unlike many other Spanish/Basque places, the cusine at this place isn't too oily
My main bone of contention with the restaurant is the service
There were two waiters for the entire restaurant on a busy Thursday night, and so we had to keep reminding our waiter to bring us anything we asked for, whether that be additional drinks, the dessert menu, or whatever
To make it worse, our waiter wouldn't write anything down!
The atmosphere is warmly dim and inviting - if you make a reservation, ask for a corner both for extra coziness! Upon other reviewers' suggestions, I tried the ham cheese croquetas and the goat cheese with honey - YUM! Both were winners
The red white sangrias were also great - red is drier, white is sweeter
I also liked the pork skewers, braised spinach, tomato confit, and chorizo (a little greasy, but it's sausage, what can you do?)
The service was laid back but good - our food came quickly and our water glasses were constantly refilled (love that)
I'll go back, for sure!

Dessert was a so-so tasting with the Key Lime Pie and Banana Cream Pie
You have to think out of the box when you eat a vegetarian restaurant and not look for Tofu with anything
But I draw the line at Soy protein product shaped into a chicken leg
I adore Zen Palate - and both the formal upstairs dining room and the crowded, counter-style cafe downstair, have their pros and cons
The formal dining area is quieter and also more pricey
The vegan Sugar cane shrimp is delish!  All in all - I really love Zen Palate - and I've been to 2 out of 3
Being a vegan myself, I've made a point of trying all the vegan restaurants in Manhattan--and Zen Palate is easily my favorite
The selection of food is excellent (I'm not used to having much choice at restaurants), and the atmosphere is great
The place has a sort of trendy pseudo-asian decor that seems perfectly casual or romantic
This particular Zen Palate is the best pick, because the prices are half those of the two other Zen Palate locations
Tried ZP before and didnt love it but figured I'd give it another try
Great appetizers
Pumpkin soup was a well-done comfort food
The MooShu spring rolls were tasty, steamed dumplings alright
My contention is with entrees
Soy gluten pieces were too big, feeling more like soggy chunks of bread
Not very appetizing
Once again, I abandoned my imitation meat
Besides, vegetarian or not, there are always ways to liven up food without compromising the healthy aspect
Needs more spices and depth to make it a scrumptious veggie delite
Service was decent
Atmosphere was young and hip
A good place for a meetup, study date, or other such meeting of minds
Prices are very reasonable- were able to get a $20 meal for 2, including 2 iced teas
Probably the best thing about this place is the location- easily accessible to browse Virgin or hang in Barnes and Nobles
Of the vege restaurants I've tried in the city so far, Zen is one of the best
Entrees are around $7-8 and the food is significantly better than many others who charge much more
The menu is large with lots of choices
As a non-veggie/vegan/frutarian, I'm not very versatile with the difference between glutens and the rest of the non-meat protein world, but I do like the food here
The Sweet and Sour Sensation is a regular on my list, and there are enough interesting dishes to explore
Reasonably priced and highly valued on the it's good for me scale
ZP has some creative dishes, odd-shaped tables and quirky service
Better than average for veggie fare - if you want something a little more inventive, check out Souen - Spring Street location
pretty tasty and pretty consistent
especially for veggie stuff
it's hard to find good, consistent, creative veggie stuff but this place is a winner
The food here has always been top notch vegetarian
The sweet-and-sour chicken thing with broccoli is one of my favorite things to eat
Consistenly good vegetarian food, especially the meat substitutes, are hard to find, but not at this place
Vegetarians and non-veggies alike will find something to enjoy
Zen has well prepared/presented, asian vegetarian cuisine
I've been a regular for years, eating in taking out
At Union Sq, the downstairs gourmet shop (al fresco dining in season) inludes 20 prix-fix entrees around $8 not to mention their delicious $2
50 soups other light entrees
Their upstairs menu atmosphere is zen-like pricier
At 46th St (one floor), you can choose from both the gourmet regular menu
Their delivery is the quickest most organized in the city; always under 15 min
even at 15 blocks away! Try the Sweet Sour Delight or Mini Vegi-Loaf -my favorites
Their scallion pancakes are the best
I've been a vegetarian for 12 yrs, but my meat-eating friends love it too
We always leave feeling lighter, healthier, full
It's not your normal chinese food; the dishes are unique
Maybe that explains the few bad reviews
I think their food is tasty
I especially like their spring rolls
Yum! The staff is friendly, and decor is good
It's all vegetarian, so don't expect any beef ribs here!
I never knew you could mess up a salad, but somehow Zen Palate managed to do just that
Not to mention everything else we ordered tasted like, well
nothing
I don't need to blow my money on food you can't even taste
the food is incredibly bland, and to top it all of i had my purse snatched while i was there today for lunch and the manager STILL made us pay for our meal
do not eat there and if you must, do not sit in the front near the cashier
How many places in NYC can you go and get a full meal for under $10? I've dragged many often unwilling non-veggie friends here, and they've all been pleasantly surprised
The food is always good, and you get a lot for your money (the entrees, which are about $7-$8, come with the main selection plus two small sides, such as some veggies and two spring rolls)
My faves are the stir-fried rice noodles, the sesame medallions and the tofu delight
A great place to go after walking around downtown- my only complaint is that the chairs are pretty uncomfortable
I've been visitng zen palate about once a week for over 2 years
Recently I purchased a dish to go, and found that all of my meal contained just one large piece of ginger root
I brought the dish back to zen palate, and the manager told me that they would compensate me with a free meal the next time I visited
When trying to claim the meal (about a week later), I was only alloted an egg roll
Treated as a bum, trying to get something for free
I'll never return to zp
i went here for a the first time last week
it was pretty good and inexpensive food
we were originally seated in the front where it was hotter and noisier, so we asked for another table in the back, where it was a lot cooler and quieter
the food was excellent, although they didn't have any dishes with meat, and the soy replacements definitely were not a replacement for meat
but, still, it was a filling and tasty meal
I usually eat at Zen whenever I'm in the neighborhood and not wanting to blow my wallet
Especially their veggie sandwich/ veggie burger with yam fries (make sure you get it with duck sauce instead of plain ketchep!)
BUT if you want really delicious vegetarian taiwanese/ chinese go to 'Happy Buddha' in Flushing
And NO I don't work there so relax
Read my review I was the first guy to write-in!
Dishes feature intriguing names, and interesting combinations of fresh ingredients
The cuisine here may be an acquired taste, and not pleasing to all comers
Service can be very slow
But the flavored iced teas are very good, especially the pineapple iced tea
While the downstairs eating area is quite loud, the upstairs is quite sublime and tranquil
A dish called Rose Petals is pretty satisfying and varied
I like the flavored iced teas in the summer
The restaurant is simple, unpretentious, and inexpensive
There are just a few wonderful choices on the menu
I'm not much of a chicken eater, but this place serves the most delicious-tasting chicken anywhere
All I can say is, you have to try it!
The Scene The original Pink Pony is no more: Gone are both the performance space and the corridor leading to Max Fish
Yet new owner Lucien Bahaj's makeover keeps this Lower East Side joint hip and happening
The restaurant is split into two rooms unified by lofty tin ceilings and a smattering of antique books and photos
By day, the more casual front room operates as a cafe-bistro; at night, one can opt to eat in the grander former nightclub space in back
The Food Eclectic is the buzzword, or, rather, the only word for a place that puts a divinely toasted peanut butter, honey and banana sandwich on the menu next to cassoulet
Comfort food is the restaurant's strength: Braised short ribs are promising, the Nicoise salad (with seared tuna) is fresh and tasty and the mashed potatoes are, true to form, delectable

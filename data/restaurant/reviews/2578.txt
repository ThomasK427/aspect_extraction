After we discovered Lattanzi Ristorante, we have gone back every time we are in the city
It is almost like going home
The service is always impeccable, and the food has been consistantly delectable
I have recommended this restaurant to many, and none have come back dissatified
Shrimp scampi
how about shrimp
four of them overcooked with their shells on
no sauce and an small side of arugala salad for about $24 (just awful)
or one heaping tablespoon of cold zabaglione on a 1/4 cup of strawberries for $8 (very good but a bit overpriced in a mini cup) or house wine at $8 a glass that was pathetic
A veal dish with fresh mozarella was fine but of no great merit
Big disappointment
artichokes, yes, three roasted quarter hearts were tasty for $8
you decide!
This place was amazing! I came with a girlfriend and we did not have reservations, but the manager found us a table anyway
Food was absolutely fabulous!
There are a lot of restaurants in the Theatre District, but this is one of the few that is worth going to even if you are not going to the theatre
Food is always excellent, I have yet to be disappointed in a meal here
Especially wonderful is the homemade mozzarella appetizer--truly the best I have ever had
In Short Deep red walls and furnishings give this two-room restaurant a slightly formal air, while its corner location and big windows allow for lots of light and a view of the theater district bustle
The dining rooms are populated by a middle-aged crowd of playgoers and locals
The menu features pastas, pizzas, a grilled salmon filet, and chicken breasts served half a dozen ways
The vibe is old-school theatre patrons
Ladies who lunch and see a matinee and older patrons enjoying a glass of wine
Older as in your grandparents (who might enjoy this place very much)
The salads are excellent for lunch--decently priced and very fresh
The Apple Chicken or Chicken and Orange Salad are amazing and when it's nice out, you can sit out in the sunshine
I will be honest though
I only eat here when I take a freelance job near it
I would never go to it
Went here last night after reading a few reviews (but not all, unfortunately)
Location near theater district is nice, but the staff is not nice
After my group of 5 seated, we ordered drinks and then ordered the food
But, then it seemed as if the wait staff forgot about us
The pasta was hot, but the cheese on top was ice cold
Towards the end of the meal, they returned and asked if we wanted dessert, even though some of us were still eating the entree
They never asked how the food was or refilled the water unless we were able to get their attention
At this point we were all pretty unsatisfied with the service
To make us be even more mad, they added a $20 tip to the bill, even though they deserved about one-tenth of it
SW 44 is a star
If you are going to see a show this is the place to go
The food is superb; the down home atmosphere and the lounge in the back provide a laid back scenario that makes for a pleasurabe dining experience
A real fun place for family and friends!
I've given this place two chances and I just don't think I can bring myself to support this place
I live nearby and I'm terribly disappointed in the service, staff need to be trained better
The owners police the place too much and treat the staff badly
Decoration is nice
Food is average and not that bad for a quick bite
I'll be going to other restaurants in the area from now on
They need to improve their service
The owners need to stay in the back and just clean up after everyone is gone
Went there with my wife Saturday night before a show
The food was fantastic
The service was great
We each had an appetizer, a seafood dish and coffee and with the tip the bill came to under $100
I had the Lobster Ravioli special with chunks of swordfish
Nice big chunks of moist delicious swordfish
My wife had the Shrimp Oreganata-plump tasty shrimp
The house red wine was good
The food and service were average at best
The waitress never came back to ask us how the food was
Getting our water refilled was a struggle and the place was rather empty that night
While I rated this place average, overall, I wouldn't recommend it because of its mediocrity
This charming Hell's Kitchen eatery could have been a jewel in the neighborhood
Instead, the rude obnoxious behavior of the owners spoils the dining experience
Like two old hens they cluck around the place, rudely rushing patrons along, and being generally distasteful
It's obvious that they've gotten family members to post reviews to this site
For me, a trip to McDonalds is much more pleasant
I was there last Saturday in the pouring rain and I'll say this, the place is pretty, the food is ok
It is not run too well
Crowded busy are normal traits in NYC
Guys in dirty white kitchen suits throwing bread on your table should not be
The owners, though very pleasant to customers, are BEYOND rude to their staff
Giving them orders to do something AS THEY ARE TAKING OUR ORDER
The waitress couldn't even hear us
And could they try a little harder to kick someone out of the table? RELAX a little
Menu is a ok - but a bit boring
Food is good, not great
The waitresses are friendly - despite being chastized every 3 seconds
hot fresh mini muffins, mimosa, bloody mary's, coffee, tea, amazing salads
I could go on
but I highly recommend this place when you are in the theater district!
I have been coming to 44 SW for years and I love it
Every person who comes to visit me in NY gets a trip to this restaurant
The food is always consistently great (I always get the same thing, but sample whatever my guest gets and its delish!)
Our waiter one night challenged me that I have never had better Tiramisu (I've had some really good Tiramisu)
He said not like his mother's
and boy was he right!!! Its now been added to my regular meal (eggplant rolintini and warm chicken salad)! Yummm
In a few words, this is the best restaurant I have ever been to!
I have known Anna and Guido for at least 15 years
They have always had the best Pizza in town and the dinners have always been nothing less than great
They both are wonerfull people and treat every one like family! I've always had very good dinners there
We go to the theatre quite often and found this Italian restaurant to be our favorite, not only because of its proximity to all the theaters, but because of its superb food and service
We have never had a bad meal and try to dine there at least once a month
We have recommended this restaurant to friends and they have started to make it a regular dining spot
The only drawback is the size of the restaurant
The tables are close together but we do not let that deter us because the food is worth the closeness
The service has always been excellent and the wait staff cheerful
Best of all the prices are reasonable for New York City
We found this restaurant and have never been disappointed
We have been here multiple times since and always enjoy a good meal

We have been to this restaurant on numerous occasions
The service has always been bad, the space has always been cramped and hectic even by New York standards, the owner has always been discourteous, but until last night, the food and prices redeemed the place
My ravioli with butter and sage was drenched in oil and tasteless and her halibut came with some ill conceived deep fried potatos
The food at Celeste used to be wonderful, and perhaps they were having an off night, but it's just not worth the hassle
My wife and I took my sister in law and hubby to Celeste after hearing so much about it
We had a wonderful time, the food was great and the service was superb! Our waiter, Marco is a charming young man, Italian/English, very polite, and extremely cultivated and gave us some great tips for our summer trip to Rome
Yes, it is a bit tight but it's just how I imagine eating in a Roman trattoria would be!
My wife and I jusy moved from Boston and heard about Celeste from acquaintances
We were given the usual warnings about the wait
It took about 15 minutes to get in at around 9pm on Thursday
The food was amazing
From the appetizers to marvolous breaded chicken dish with almonds that came with a mix salad with balsamic
We had a bottle of Montepulciano for only $27
We topped off the night with Tiramisu which is the best we've ever had
Celeste is a great experince I assure you will returning to soon!
as a frequent patron of celeste and a local west sider i am suprised by anybody who does not have a great exprience at this restaurant
While true it is crowded and cramped celeste filled a huge void in the neighborhood producing high quality authentic italian fare at extremelt affordable prices
The food is remarkably consistent and the pizza and pastas are some of the best i've had in any restaurant in NY
Keep up the good work
Bravo!
We've dined here about 4x, and each time the service has been pretty bad
I came back hoping that it was an off night, and I'd like to give it another chance since I live in the neighborhood
We are big fans of Bianca on the LES, which is owned by the same group
some menu items are even identical, yet Bianca's taste better
Every single time we've dined at Celeste, we're being rushed
the hostess is rude as can be, the waiters can't stop to check in, the busboys are flinging stuff on your table, and that's true even when the restaurant is half empty! The food is okay, but you'd be better off going to Bianca where the food is far superior, the host (George)is charming, the place itself is prettier, and the staff is always friendly even if it's busy all the time
No more chances for Celeste
The dishes are small to me
My date and I each ordered an appitizer, a main dish, and a desert
With a bottle of wine
the price no longer seemed like one dollar sign ($) at all! It was good but it was expensive
I didn't feel rushed but then again I don't thing I was there duringh peak times
The cramped space was a little annoying but it all seemed fun
I would go there if you haven't yet
but I'm not going back
My daughter invited my wife and me to join her boyfriend and another friend for dinner
We arrived at 6:00 and were cordially seated
After sitting in a cramped confined setting next to the kitchen, we finished our meal and were asked to vacate as there were people waiting for the table
Never, never have I been asked to leave before I was ready
I will never step foot in that place again, guest or paying
Outrageous
I have to agree with many of the other posters
Don't pause for one second between bites because they are watching you! The second I put my fork down after finishing my entree, the plate vanished
We ordered dessert, but the whole vibe was hurry up and get out
The food is good, but not worth getting pushed out
And this guy is from Italy, where people linger over dinner for hours? Hard to believe
The treatment the mananger gives to its costumers
may ruin your night
Service are always pushing you to finish quickly and complain when you ask for more food or drinks
! When I asked for an extra appetizer they told me that I could not do it because there are strict rules for ordering that you have to follow
basically order everything in the fisrt 5 minutes and then live
terrible service
The worste treatment ever had
The owner is a jerk that desrespect his costumers
He scremed at my eldery mother when she asked (after an hour of waiting) how long we need to wait
Maybe he was too stressed, however he is not mature enough to run a business
you cannot enjoy your meal without being disturbed every 5 min
until you pay and get the hell out of there! ridiculous
you will feel almost miserable
WARNING! DO NOT GO THERE
I had the same experience as the person below (same night too i guess!)
i had been before and loved it
our waiter was fine till our plates were taken away then it was rush rush rush
one of us still had wine, so the others tried to order dessert drinks, but the owner told us no because there were people waiting and the waiter said if he served us more he would be fired
ridiculous
i'm a waitress and would never say such things to a customer
i think they felt we should have ordered more food, but i was stuffed after cheese, salad and pizza! so we sat there for a long time with nothing in front of us, shocked
i am never going back and telling everyone i know not to go there
We went to Celeste for dinner and ordered a bottle of white wine (placed on the table without ice)
We had no sooner put down our forks and finished our entrees when the check appeared
Now, I know better than to linger at a busy restaurant over a glass of water or a last few sips of wine
But we had a lot of wine left
We tried to drink as quickly as possible without actually making ourselves sick
Nonetheless, about 10 minutes later the waitress came over to our table and announced that could we please pay and leave, as many people were waiting
I was shocked
We paid our check and left
On the way out, I approached the manager, who said I'm sorry you feel that way, but there are a lot of people waiting
This has NEVER happened to me in 10 years in New York
I live around the corner from this place and every time I go the food is fantastic
Yes, there is a long wait but if you know this then you can just get there ahead of time
The service has always been great and although there is always a wait, I never feel rushed to get out of the restaurant
The menu is small so if you go more than once, you should try one of the specials - they are always fantastic
The process to put your name on the wait list can be a bit stressfull but the owner always seems to notice you and when he gets a chance he always comes over
This is really a great find - espcially for those who live close by!
In a city filled with Italian restaurants, it was refreshing to find one where the owner visits your table, speaking of his recent trip to Italy to collect cheeses for the platter you have an option of ordering
From the fried artichoke to the homemade pasta, there isn't a dud on the menu
Expect the authentic experience of Ciao being shouted across thye room, as the owner recognizes one of his regulars
You won't pay the hefty price of a trendy Trattoria, nor will you be disappointed
It's worth the wait there usually is since there are no reservations
Bellisima!!
The wait for a party of 5 on a Friday around 7pm was 25 minutes
The owner (Carmine) bounced around to chat, but on busy nights, be aggressive in getting his attention to put your name on the list
The dining area is very small but generally feels warm and welcoming
Pass the pizza and go for the pasta; thats what stood out during our visit for its fresh, homemade taste and $10 price tag
After dinner, the real fun was sipping coffee while Carmine took us on a journey around a cheese plate
Admittedly, there were some tastes we wouldnt mind skipping in future, but it was fun
By telling the wait staff ahead of time that we were going to order coffee dessert, then ordering both at once, we avoided the rushed feeling some other patrons have mentioned
One warning cash only!
I can't understand why this place is so popular
I've tried 3 times

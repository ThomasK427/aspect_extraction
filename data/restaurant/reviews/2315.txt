It was a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone
The owners came in a few times to make sure everything was ok
A friend and I were on the UES and were going to get a casual meal when we got stuck in some heavy rain, so stopped into Il Monello
From the time we walked in the door, the staff was very gracious, greeting us, welcoming us, taking our coats, and even helping to store a very large package we were carrying
The food and wine were very good, and although it was a little pricey, the service made up for it and personally, we figured we were paying a 'not wandering around in the rain fee'
I would go back again
I used to go to this popular restaurant with my family in the 80's and early 90's
I have not been there in at least 10 years, what a shock to find out the other evening that the original owner sold and everything I remember has changed
The food was overpriced and not exciting, the wine by the glass a chianti I felt was corked the manager brought me another glass but also charged me
Thank goodness for fond memories
I just recently went to Italy and I must say that I felt the food was better at IL Monello
The room has just a great feel to it, and the service is over the top
I highly recommend trying IL Monello if you have not yet!!
This place is pricey - but the waitstaff is attentive and good
The risotto and salads are wonderful
Nice drinks from the bar and a classy feel to the place
Not the BEST but certainly very good
Random choice out of Zagat guide at first, but now I go back again and again, especially for the creamy tomato risotto and the osso bucco
Nice ambience, good service
but a tiny bar that can get crowded on busy night
Make a reservation and DON'T BE LATE
I was there on saturday night
The pizza was out standing
I never had a pizza so good
not even in Italy
The waiter was so friendly and nice
I enjoyed their salad
and waiter really knows about wine
The wine selection was outstanding
little expensive but it was worth paying for
ice tea is very good
nice atmosphere
good service
good food
friendly waiter thanks mezzaluna!!!!!!
I had a pizza there last week and it was sooooo good I had to share this infor with other people
small brick oven restaurant very cute and cozy
good selection of wine and the waiter really seem to know about wine
it was worth spending money there
oh I had some nice pasta too yesterday
I had very good salad
good to eat real italian food by italian people
Thanks to waiter I learned so much about wine too
Mezzaluna has one of the best pizza I've ever tried in the United States
Food is simple and tasty
If you have been in Italy and have not been living as a tourist then you are going to love this place
The decor is not that great and the dessert is disappointing
The food is decent, though not spectacular
But the service was terrible - we couldn't get water, we never got bread, and then the waiter disappeared
At the end of the meal, we were ready to order dessert
The waiter brought the dessert menus - but then disappeared again
The busboy (!) finally had to bring us the check
And it turns out that the ice teas we ordered were $4
50 each - it wasn't bad tea, but any non-alcoholic beverage that's pushing $5 had better be incredible - this was just tea
A Diet Coke was $3
And the final insult - they only take AmEx
Well, ok, fine - I don't like using my corporate AmEx, and I don't carry that much cash, so we just won't eat there again
I recommend that you don't, either - it's really not worth the hassle for mediocre food
Possibly the worst chicken enchilada I've ever had
They stuck it in the microwave and forgot the sour cream
The enchilada was too thick and chewy
I chose this restaurant to go to for an early New Year's Eve dinner because they offer a gluten-free menu, and one of my best friends has Celiac's Disease, so although the choices are limited here in the city with restaurants that offer a gluten-free menu, the choice was easy, and all of us could not have been happier with the decision
The establishment itself is one of a cozy environment, and that night the restaurant was decorated beautifully
The staff was so accomodating to each and everyone of our needs
The food was great! My friend who ordered from the gluten-free menu had such a delicious meal prepared for her
Not only was she thrilled, but I as well
I am so happy that now we have a place to go to that she can eat and enjoy the food just as much as I do
I visited Lumi w/ a group of friends-it was a memorable experience for all of us
When we arrived, the place was bustling + we needed a table for 7 yet the manager was remarkably accommodating
We had cocktails at the bar (the Gladiatore martini was delicious), and in a few minutes our table was ready
The manager sat us at a round table and service was very attentive
I had a pasta for appetizer - home made ravioli with ricotta and spinach, and it was surprisingly tasty
For my main course I tried the Osso Bucco and it was marvelous: tender, succulent and full of flavor - one of the best I've had
We went outside for coffee and cigarettes in a lovely outdoor cafe, and wrapped our dinner up with some grappa and muscat with home made biscotti
I'm definitely going back for more
It was quite delightful to find this charming Tuscan-influenced restaurant on the Upper East Side amongst its pretentious neighbourhood restaurants, with its unique cuisine and an elegant ambiance
The upstairs dining room is particularly romantic with comfortable bunkets and seductive lighting
For appetizers, try the delicate baby artichoke salad and for main course, try the whole roasted striped bass, which is cooked to perfection and can be served whole or filleted
Magnifico Lumi!
This is a solid little place in a really cool neighborhood
Salads were delicious (the frisee with gorgonzola and baby artichokes with parmesan were the best) and the entrees (salmon, lamb shank and cavatelli with sausage) were great! Service was friendly and efficient too
Just one caution: Review your bill
We ordered wine that was clearly listed at $39 a bottle on the Wine List but, when the bill came, they showed it at $41
When pointed out, the correction was made, no problem
All in all, an enjoyable meal in a comfortable place!
In Short This intimate cabaret cafe showcases living song legends like Eartha Kitt (and Bobby Short, until he retired in 2004), as well as Woody Allen and his jazz ensemble
The dinner menu features standard French and American fare: smoked salmon, New York strip sirloin, etc
You can catch the show in the bar for just the price of the cover charge, but it's standing room only
The room, service and ambience truly speak of a bygone elegance and capture the spirit of Old New York
I went to see Eartha Kitt and was as impressed by the service as I was by her amazing performance
The food was basic, America fare - very well-prepared but nothing too exciting
And it was extremely expensive, but worth every penny
I would strongly recommend Cafe Carlyle as THE BEST special occasion restaurant in the city
I booked a table weeks in advance for my mother and me to see Woody Allen's show in the Carlyle Cafe
Upon timely arrival they put us in the last corner of the room, next to the stage behind the drummer
It was not that there weren't any other tables free and we weren't dressed in jeans either
We were about to dine there for more than $500 including grat and cover! The food was ok but definitely not worth this money
The partial view table either
I did not want to spoil the party cause my mother really loved the show, but I do not recommend this place to anyone
If at all, try to get a place at the bar and hold on to a beer while enjoying the fabulous band!

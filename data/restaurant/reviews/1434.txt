This pseudo Mediteranean restaurant has a great vibe when you walk in but it goes down hill very quickly from there
Poor service, pretty awful food (my fish was terrible and I was sent back and I never send back food) and an arrogance that is pretty high by NYC standards should keep you away till the next restaurant to fill Patria's void comes around
I love the atmosphere in Barbounia, it's so lively, it seems like everyone is having a good time, but the music is still low enough to hold a conversation w/o straining your vocal chords
It's a good place to go with a group
The food is delicious; for appetizers, I liked the pikilia and especially the saganaki; as an entree, the grilled branzino is exquisite
The Turkish coffee at the end was really good
got there, it was a pretty setup, except for that odd feathery thing hanging from the ceiling
bartenders were great, recommended good wine,
and then, our table was late, very late
but the hostess more than made up for it with her attentive service in a packed place
sent us some free amuses at the bar, and a glass of wine while we waited
the food was well worth it, from the octopus salad to veal medallions to delicious risotto which makes a great late night snack when leftover
and then a complimentary desert to make up for our wait
we could have left grumpy and angry about the service, but they did the best they could with a smile and really exceeded our expectations
not a bad looking crowd, either
I had walked past Barbounia several times and was attracted by how pretty it was, even on the outside
I finally tried it for dinner and it exceeded my expectations
The restaurant is beautiful, comfortable and welcoming
The cozy banguets with cushions and flowy curtains add to the ambiance
We shared the Greek salad and a hummus dish for an appetizer and I had snapper for dinner
The food was great, the service very attentive and it had a great wine list
We liked our dessert so much - the apple phylo cigars, so much that we ordered a second portion! The atmosphere was lively but not too loud that we could not hear each other
Very fun and intimate at the same time
Very enjoyable and not like every other place out there
This restaurant is awesome and I didn't think all that expensive, comparing to a sushi place not too far away
I've been going to this newly opened restaurant since it opened, and although the menu changed a bit it's still great
The cold cuts and cheese boards are a great way to start, but their spreads on their bread is unbeatable
The service has always been outstanding and even when we didn't have a reservation they worked something out, where I agreed to keep our meal to just eating
I highly recommend this place, great food, great service and the place is beautiful
If there's one thing I'd say they could fix is the door
When both doors open, a gust of cold wind rushes into the main room, if you're sitting in the path you'll feel it
One star only?, Why?, this place deserve at least 2 stars
But, Chef Michael Cressotti knows is the best place in town, excelent food, friendly and great service
Thanks Barbounia!
Sometimes you need to disagree with a famous newspaper food critic and try a restaurant for yourself
I decided to try Barbounia which I am truly glad I did
I am not sure what the food critic was thinking but my overall experience was extremely satisfactory
One you walk in notice the crystal and feather chandelier in the middle of the room
Place is decorated to give it a modern yet comfortable feel
Open kitchen always makes me feel good about a restaurant
Our table near the kitchen gave us an advantage point to see the Chef Michael and his staff in action also the occasional flames and captivating smells
Food is based on traditional Greek specialties as well as other Mediterranean influenced flavors with a good selection of Greek wine to match your taste
Definitely try the Saganaki, Lamb Chops and the Yogurt panna cota with Turkish coffee
This place is awesome
The food was great and the service was excellent
The decor is very sexy and curtains and candles are very romantic
The staff is very attentive and we waited for a table at the bar which was packed with good looking people
Would definitely recommend this place
Very cool co-ed bathrooms
LOVED my experience at this place! Even though the place was crawling with models other beautiful people our party of four--all of us definatley NOT beautiful people--were treated like royalty
Ther room is lively but not too loud, the chairs are the most comfortable in ANY restaurant in NYC, the service was first class friendly the food was GREAT reasonably priced
The wine list has many good wines in the $35 range
All of us had drinks, appetizers, main courses, dessert coffee even with a generous (20%) tip it only set us back $85 each
Great value, great food, great time
HIGHLY recommended!
This restaurant is as delicious as it is beautiful! As soon as we walked in I knew I would love it - it has gauzy drapes on the ceiling, soft pillows to sit on, a really eye-catching chandelier
Everything we ordered was great, especially the lamb beef kebabs, branzino rib eye
I also loved the 3 cocktails I tried
Our waiter was very attentive without being intrusive; I found the noise level just right, so we could hear each other easily but it didn't seem too quiet; the bar is a pleasure to look at, not to mention drink at
It was great on my date subsequent bar visits, I can't wait to take my friends there
I think it's one of the best restaurants in the vicinity
We've been to Barbounia three times and the food is excellent
The interior is beautiful and very sexy
The cocktails are creative and really good
Very good looking bar scene
Love the open kitchen and the interior design
After reading the menu stantion outside and drooling over the variety then stepping inside to check out the scene on a Monday night
I have been back twice in one week! It is the perfect restaurant for all ages, personalities, and palates
The service is impeccable -- from the hostess to the wait staff, even the busers
bring your girlfriends, suggest it for a date, have a business meeting over this meal, and definitely take your parents
The couch seating feels like its your den at home, you can get cozy and forget where you are
Go for the fish from the grill -- ask them to filet it if you rather not do it yourself and if you have ever been to Greece - you will appreciate the Greek Salad
Enjoy!
From the outside the place looks absolutely adorable and to dine there surpassed my expectation
Just being open 6 weeks, I was expecting service in training but the service was better than most NY restaurants
My water never reached empty! The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and polite
The menu was excellent, and the food was even better! The music is at a very comfortable volume, so you can hear the person you are eating with, but yet it doesnt seem too loud in the restaurant - which was full
I would recommend it to just grab dinner with a friend, for a date, or for a special occation
We went there this weekend w/friends, waited 45 min
for our reservations, and the hostess didn't seem to care
The menu was more American than Greek
Appetizers were pretty good especially the mousaka, kofte, and oven baked cheese
Entrees were pricey and non-adventurous
I had the snapper which was pretty good, but without a wow effect
Wifey had veal medallions which were so-so
Decor was chic and modern w/an incredible chandelier, but overall the service was slower than it should be
My advice: spend more time on the menu than picking the chandelier
If you haven't ducked into the back of ABC Carpet and Home on B'Way, just north of Union Square, then you're missing out on what is truly, indisputably the city's best chocolate
In addition to a dizzying array of bonbons and the most decadent hot or iced chocolate this side of the moon, Michel Cluizel's staff is trained to host chocolate tastings that carefully pair chocolates and liqueurs for maximum choco-madness
The food is excellent
best mac Cheese I've had in years
The portions are huge and the very affordable
Nice Vibe and great customer service
Nice decor and classy, but low key
I live three blocks from this jem and as a steak fan felt obligated to give it a try
I have been to the famed Luger's, so the menu and price came at no surprise
Overall, this is a great place for a dinner with friends or taking a client
The menu and prices are nearly identical to Luger's except here you can also get seafood and individual cuts of meat
The main difference is the service
We had to call and change the amount for our reservation twice

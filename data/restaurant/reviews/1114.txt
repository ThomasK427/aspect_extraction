the food was so not worth the wait
this place is overpriced and you get little food with no taste
i have no idea why people flock to this place!!
Excellent food, each dish was beautifully presented and tasted great
Not your run of the mill Thai
Prompt seating, service was decent, but nothing to complain about
Pleasant atmosphere and nice decor, although tables were way too close to each other
Overall would definitely dine there again
This is the best example of new American style Thai food anywhere
The menu is full of interesting and flavorful dishes
The crispy fish and chocolate spare ribs are a must
The traditional Thai dishes are as close to those I had in Bangkok and Phuket as you can get anywhere in NYC
The room is well designed and the service is friendly
The bar is small so come close to reservation time
Very rude hostesses
Crowded bar full of people who think they've discovered the new hip restaurant
Terrible service
Definitely avoid this restaurant if you're looking for a pleasant dining experience
I recommend staying home, dimming the lights, putting some orchids in a glass of water and ordering take-out
we waited a very long time to get seated
service was good
however, the plates were very small so we had to reorder once we got the food
ambience was very trendy but it's one of those places you feel that you've been to many times before
basically just like any other trendy place in nyc
enjoyable experience but i won't be coming back any time soon
Took a chance and arrived with no reservation on Saturday night with my gf and another couple who are good friends
The hostess offered us a table outside which we accepted
It was quite comfortable and the heat lamps were far enough away to be useful but not intrusive
We shared four apps and four entrees, the best of which were the foie gras (amazing), the braised short ribs, and the curried monkfish - the latter being one of the most amazing things i've ever tasted
The service was less than par unfortunately - our waiter had no charisma and the runners litterally dropped the plates on our table
The food and ambiance were enough to offset this however, so definitely check it out for the tastes, some of which reach transcendant heights
Went during a weeknight with some girlfriends
The service was very good; prompt and concise
Our share plates were changed regularly and our drinks always full
The food, is not memorable, to be honest
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either
It was good
It's more americanized-Thai than anything
The seating is comfortable and a very relaxed atmosphere
Prompt accomidating seating
Although they couldn't honor our Wednesday night reservation for 40 minutes, they made up for it with a round of free cocktails
Lychee Martini and Mixed Berry Mojito - yum and yum, respectively
Cold Thai Beef appetizer - delicious
Rock Shrimp appetizer - even more delicious
Green Curry Short Ribs - very good
Very spicy
French portions, be advised
The signature Sea Bass - fantastic
Melts in your mouth
Right up there in terms of greatness with Nobu's Miso Glazed Sea Bass
Dessert - Thai Sundae, which topped everything off swimmingly
Crowd varied
Certainly a lot of trend-bots and ladies who pout, but they're good for decorating
Server was a fifteen-percenter, obviously bogged down and a bit slow on the refilling 'o the wine
Overall, great place
Will be back
I was somewhat hesitant to try Kittachai after reading some of the reviews
A girlfriend of mine from L
A
(who is very difficult to please and has tried every new restaurant across the country) called me at the last minute and told me she was in town
I was able to get reservations the day of for a Tuesday night
I arrived 5 minutes late and the hostess greeted me by name (I had made reservations through opentable
com) and we were promptly seated
Our server immediately arrived and made several recommendations
The food was excellent
My friend could not stop with the compliments
I had the Chilean sea bass, which was phenomenal
Great place overall, but I wouldn't call the crowd trendy or beautiful
It was more of a Midtown/Bridge and Tunnel vibe
Went there on a Sat night and was seated promptly
The restaurant is beautiful, definitely a place to remember in the city
The waitresses were beautiful but also surprisingly very friendly
The place was packed with good looking people, mostly around the ages of late 20s-late 30s
The food is good (but not the best Thai), but the portions are very small
Definitely try the Thai Iced Tea Ice Cream Sundae
It was soooo GOOD! Make sure you have reservations for the place if you are going during peak dinner hours
Altogether an enjoyable experience
But save this place for date nights, when you arent that hungry and just want to impress your date with a romantic setting
Ok, so the orchids and the sunken pool are gorgeous, the cocktails incredibly incredible (especially if you are in the midst of a painful evening) and the food is yumm but I wouldn't go back any time soon because I missed the solicitous caring that other restaurants simply call service
A restaurant is supposed to be an experience that begins at the door and believe me, the hard-faced wonder at the front desk makes you want to leave before the evening's begun
Someone should tell her that smiling makes the best kind of wrinkles and being courteous will being her good karma, which I am sure she sorely needs
Kittichai certainly has some amazing food - the bean curd with spicy cashew nut sauce is especially good
The decor of the place was gorgeous as well - definitely one of the best-designed restaurants I've seen
We went with a group of 7 - it's a great place for a group of friends to get together and share a lot of dishes
Also highly recommend the mixed berry mojito! Only cons I can think of is that it's slightly overpriced and the service was a little slow
Also, although we had reservations and the restaurant was not overflowingly crowded, we still had to wait a bit too long to be seated
My boyfriend and I went during restaurant week
The place is very trendy and the prix fixe which they're offering for the rest of the summer is a great deal
The nyc lunch special is usually not one of my favorites and tends to be a let down
Not this one
kittichai's food was so outstanding, I could not stop raving to my waitress, whom by the way was as good and friendly as can be
GO here! I am going to return again and again
Can't wait to bring my husband and my good food loving 2 yr old as well
The food here is fantastic as well as the service
Beautiful people watching as well
Great for a date or large group, very trendy as well as sexy for a date
The price is worth the dinner
after all they hype and all the glowing reviews, this must rank among the greatest gastronomic disappointments in my life
this meal is what i would expect to eat at a thai restaurant located in a fancy hotel in kansas city
best thai in the city? it's not even the best thai in the neighborhood

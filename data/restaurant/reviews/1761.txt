because of the mistake, i might have been wary of the dish in the future, but such wonderful customer service will keep me coming back
a wonderful neighborhod staple
I have eaten her for breakfast and dinner several times, and it is GREAT every time I go
The food is awsome and the scenery inside is just as good as looking out from the 2nd floor over 8th street
It is a great place to take a bunch of your friends and hang out and enjoy some terrific food and sights
Prices are reasonalble and portions are larger than you would expect for the price
Is a Tuna filet supposed to be chewey and difficult to even pull from your fork
No and somebody needs to teach Dish this
The fries were nothing special although not terrible
The spinach-rice had awful flavor and the French Onion soup (the best part of the meal) was covered with cheese but it wasn't broiled until it began to brown as it should have been
Lots of value from the Dish: huge menu, great big burgers and salads, warm bread, fast service
Best value on 8th Avenue - 2 can eat for $25 (if you don't ordera Jealous Bitch or 2 from the drink list)
Go upstairs and ask for a window seat in summer, and watch the show on 8th Avenue as well as catch some fresh air
If you're nice to the cute waiters they often bring a dessert on the house
Gaggles of guys eating together having fun
you will too
Always an interesting gaggle of folks checking each other out at this place, features nice opening to the street in warmer weather
Good looking men and more good looking men, but not a happy hunting ground unless you are also a good looking man
Well-mannered girls like me were made very welcomed and served delicious Matzo ball soup
This is really one of the best diners in the city
The menu is GIGANTIC
And not only that, it runs the gamut of food styles
The atmosphere isn't greasy like most diners
As a matter of fact, its quite airy and open
The wait staff is friendly
Sunday Brunch is great as well
A chelsea gem
The lunch special is a great deal
For such a big menu, they do a remarkable amount well
Especially recommend the pastas with chicken and either pesto or vodka sauces
The upstairs seats by the windows are great for people watching
I thought the food was excellent (particularly the spaghetti dish that they prepare at your table), but if you're not Asian, the waiter practically ignores you
I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is Chinese, Japanese, etc
Unless of course you don't mind being treated like a second-class citizen
The service isn't the greatest on earth but this place does get packed and it's small so I can see why it's that way
I'm more concerned about the food being good and it's well done here
Especially since the food is not too heavy and really brings out the flavors of all the ingredients
Try it out and judge for yourself but the food is good anyway you look at it
i enjoyed the food the first time so i went back with a big group of people
i never met a waiter with such bad attitude and service
and the manager didn't do anything about it when we complained
we'll never go back again
One of my newest haunts
I went with a friend to check the place out, I've had it on my must try list and we had a blast! Went back with a friend from out of town, and again we were served with the most delicious fusion of Italian Japanese, or Italian, depending on the dishes you order
It has become my favorite place to grab Italian! I love the open kitchen!!! Dishes are not typical American Italian
order appetizers, entrees
etc
I love their pasta served in a half wheel of Parmasean
they dip the pasta and then place it on a plate over prosciutto
you will make the other diners envious!!!
Basta Pasta is one of my favorite places to eat
The staff is polite and respectful
The presentation of the food is beautiful
I would recommend eating the chilean sea bass
The complimetary crackers with some special cheese spread is soooo goood
Our waiter was very tending seeing that we enjoy our meal
Fantastic food
The pasta is perfectly done
True the portions are huge super-sized plates, but the food is very well balanced, beautifully presented
Our server was competent, though not very informative nor knowledgeable of the wine menu
The service at this place was snobby, rude, and irresponsible and refused to seat us
Friends and I have a weekly dinner gathering
I made reservation for 10 over the phone during the day
The man with japanese accent told me it was no problem and I was looking forward to visitng this place
When we showed up at the restaurant, the manager claimed that I made reservation for TWO instead of TEN and flat out told us we don't seat that many and refused to even apologize for the miss communication
He simply expected us to leave
I was baffled by his rude behavior!  The ten of us coming from all over town was stranded with no place to go
Still if he apologized I would have walked away wanting to come back later
I think their little success is getting to their head
Basta Pasta is a like a typical Italian restaurant you would find in Japan
Several of its pasta offerings are favorites of patrons in Japan, such as the Tobiko pasta
I would highly recommend the Uni pasta if you are a fan of sea urchin, although sometimes there are misses when the sea urchin is not as fresh as it should be
The filet mignon with foie gras is delicious, but a little heavy, I suggest sharing that with others
Another all time favorite is the parmagiano reggiano pasta with prosciutto, they prepare the pasta in half wheel of cheese tableside
Wine selection is decent but not broad, and decently priced
I'd recommend calling ahead for a table if you go during busy hours, cause they do get packed somewhat
i'm almost reluctant to write a recommendation, because then it would be too difficult to get a table
i absolutely love this place
with its japense influence, the pasta is fresh and light
it's absolutely delicious
the service is very friendly and unobtrusive
the ambience is simple and fun with its open-air kitchen
I've frequented this Japanese-run Italian restaurant for a number of years now and keep coming back for the simple reason that it provides a consistenly pleasant dining experience
The open-kitchen provides a lively and somewhat unique ambience, as does the changing artwork and mechanistic efficiency of the staff
The service is always courteous, although occasionally slow when it's busy
Although the prix fixe is a great deal, I find the quality of the dinner cuisine to be a far better indicator of the chefs' talents
I highly recommend the anchovy vegetable dip, sliced duck entree, and warm chocolate cake
If you want family style Italian, this is not for you- their dishes are generally nicely proportioned so that you can still enjoy an appetizer and/or dessert, but it's not about quantity here
The ingredients are fresh, which means terrific sauces
Having travelled extensively in Europe and Asia, I have had the pleasure of eating at many wonderful restaurants
Although Basta Pasta is not your typicial hearty Italian family restaurant, it is my absolute favorite restaurant in New York
The menu contains both Japanese fusion and plain Italian dishes - everyone should be able to find something they like
For those who appreciate fresh ingredients and truly wonderful cooking, this is the place for you
In the Japanese style, portions are not gigantic like American standards, but they are the perfect size
(I saw some complaints about the portions in other reviews but really, it's no wonder Americans are so fat!)  The waitstaff is attentive and kind, true to the Japanese standards of service
The decor is minimal, but decorated with the works of art that change from month to month
Overall, there is nothing to complain about!
I took an out-of-town friend here for luch and it was great
The portion was large enough for me to have lunch the next day
The pasta was delicious, the salad fresh and crisp, and the dessert heavenly

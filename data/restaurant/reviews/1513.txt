Cafe Boulevard is my favorite places since I found it a few months ago - if NJ had more places like this I would never leave or drive to the city
The places is cool, funky, the music is amazing, the food is great, beautiful friendly service, great sangria and cocktails
This is a place to really chang out and chill is NJ
Great date spot too
What a great place I found cafe Boulevard in Fort Lee
I can't believe it
I have lived in this area a long time and have been waiting for a place like this
Finally a REAL reataurant, bar, lounge
The food and drinks are great too
Good music and amazing decor and atmosphere
Try it you'll like it
Oh I forgot - the menu selection is very big and amazingly diverse too
I've been to this area for business several times this year and was fortunate enough to make it back to this restaurant
Lucky for me, it was just as great as the first time! I was warmly welcomed and experienced attentive service throughout my meal
The ambience is perfect for a romantic meal, but will work for small business dinners as well
The homemade pastas are exceptional, as was the eggplant parmesan
Ask for a table by the windows if you want to stay away from the bar smoke
I ate here once and it was fantastic! the food was great, the ambiance was exellent and it was just a beautiful atmosphere,
tHE DINNING SERVICE WAS PROMP AND VERY PROFFESSIONA
i WOULD RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURant to a friend any time
The best Sicilian and regular slices or pies--better than NY
anywhere!
Top quality ingredients
The heros are great too, $5
00 and loaded with meat
This is truly a great Garfield Eatery
Food is great and it's a fun place to eat
The hotel concierge recommended this restaurant, and I am so glad that she did! The wine list was minimal, but had many 'tried and true' wines
The menu leaned toward Portuguese style as well as Spanish
Many seafood options as well as chicken, beef and pork
The coffee was first rate and the dessert was delicious
The service was attentive, friendly, and helpful as well as impeccably dressed
i love this place!! the food is always great (very fresh tasting - try the tuna tadaki!), with extremely accomodating and helpful staff
one time i showed up with a friend 15 minutes before closing, but they did not rush or make us feel uncomfortable in the least
the atmosphere is just right, with dimmed lighting, but not so much that you can't see your date or have to shout to hear each other
the only bad thing is that this place is closed on sundays :( :( :(
If you're looking for Japanese food in Hoboken, this is the place
The wait staff is excellent, the food is great and reasonably priced
It's really great when they have sumo matches on TV
There are a number of places in Hoboken that serve sushi, this place is the best!
Yama, aka Ubu, is a cut above the glut of other sushi restaurants in Hoboken
They serve all the staple rolls as well as a few house specials
Try the Trio spicy roll or the Toro Yaki roll for an example of the best in the restaurant
My sister I dine out often in our hometown of Hoboken, NJ
Recently, we were wanting to try somewhere new decided on the Gaslight Restaurant
The exterior is nearly as cool as the interior
We loved the decor ~ for some reason, it evoked feelings of being on vacation vs
being in Hoboken
Special appetizer portobello we got was not only delicious, but a good value (@ $9 total is was def
big enough for 2pp ~ the nice waiter even had it served on 2 plates w/o us having to request it)
For our entrees, we split their lobster ravioli a fish special of the night
Both were good (esp
the special)
Oh, I forgot to mention the warm rolls served when we first arrived were comforting
We are big on desert
the Gaslight did not disappoint! Everything sounded pretty amazing (vast selections!), but we ultimately (each!) went w/ the desert special -- which was an out-of-this-world melted cookie extravaganza creation (in fact, I'm still dreaming of it may return soon just for it! ;-))
One of the most frustrating things we encounter when dining out is it always seems to take us a really long time to get our check
This was not the case @ the Gaslight
Our friendly waiter timed everything perfectly
We will most definitely be returning highly reccommend the Gaslight
Outstanding service
My bf ordered a beer which the waiter poured into a glass sideways, interesting and very kewl to watch
Once placed on the table, the waiter noticed the beer was a bit flat and rushed off to replace it
I have eaten in many restaurants in NYC, LA, Newport, Seoul, Rio, Manila, Anchorage, Jamaica, Caymans, Puerto Rico and Hawaii and have never seen this happen
Generally one would have to point out to the waitstaff the beer was flat and ask for another
Very attentive and pleasant staff, nice ambiance, even the other patrons were happy, relaxed and friendly
Food was also quite good, meal well spiced and portions hearty
If only I had been on the ball and asked for the remainder to be wrapped for a yummy snack later
Recntly on my drive through NJ going to PA I had the pleasure of stopping to see a friend in Hoboken
She is absolutely crazy about Indian food
In the search of Indian food we spotted this place called India on the Hudson on Washington Street
After thinking awhile I decided to give it a try thinking that it might not be the best Indian food that I will have
The restaurants apparently provides free parking, not that parking was a problem at the time
Well staffed place with good decor for romantic date even qualifys for a first date
Food was decent with good service not the best that I've had but definitely not bad at all
If anyone ever is wandering in that area and wishes to try Indian food, India on the Hudson is a place that's worth a visit
They have the best Italian Food in Hoboken by far
Specials vary with Salmon, Red Snapper, Filet of Sole, Clams, Shrimp, Scallops, Chicken and Pasta dishes that are out of this world
They give out pagers that work across the street at the bar and will page you when your table is ready
It is worth the wait
The service is really good too
They are very nice and take very good care of you (especially the waiter with the blue eyes)
He is unbelievable and makes you feel at home
Overall I give Margheritas an Excellent Rating!!
Not only is Margherita's the best Italian restaurant in Hoboken
It also has reasonable prices and BYOB! But by far the most value comes with their mixed green salad (under $4
) It's big enough for two and has all the veggies you would want in a salad and more
Marheritas is by far the best Italian restaurant in Hoboken! The food is wonderful and the portions are huge (you'll have enough for dinner the next night!) They do not take reservations, so be prepared to wait on the weekend - they have pagers that will work at the bar next door, so have a drink while you wait! Its also BYOB adding to the reasonably priced night!
Small menu, but only because everything on it is made to perfection
Excellent Italian food
Call for a reservation, though, because it's a small place and there are not alot of seats
You'll wind up spending hours waiting for a table
We go to Ted Jo's almost every week with our toddler
We always enjoy the food and the service is usually good
We enjoy sitting outside in the nice weather
It is a great place for family's to go and enjoy a good meal
The bar is for the older neighborhood crowd but the Sunday brunch is great - whether recovering from a Saturday night or starting a new hangover
Food is pretty good and drinks are as strong as your relationship with the bar staff
This was one of my best dinning experiences, the staff are like family, the atmosphere is like being in one's own dining room and the food is so delicious, I highly reccommend this restaurant and I will go back time and time again
Excellent service, Excellent food

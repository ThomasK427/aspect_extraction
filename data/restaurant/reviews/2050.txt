There were sofas next to several fireplaces and an elegant dining room with a balconey dining area as well
Our host seated us promptly and gave us a table where we can hear the piano but not distracted by it
The food was great, especially the crab-scallop cake and the smoke duck w/ foie gras
Also, desserts like the chocolate fondant were delicious too
All the negativity I seen lately is probably due to their restaurant week offerings, which by no means had small portions compared to some other high-end dining spots
I strongly recommand the 7 course tasting menu which includes tuna tatar w/ foie gras, lobster appetizer, beef wellington, and lamb chops for only $79
Don't come for food, and don't come for fine-dining service, because OIBL offers neither
We men pay outrageous sums for a romantic place, and that's what this joint goes over-the-top to deliver
The restaurant ran out of chicken from the restaurant week menu and refused to substitute another dish
My foursome all had to settle for the salmon--how boring when the tab comes to $85/person! The waiter had limited fine-dining experience; he needlessly embarassed me when I asked a wine question
(Note to the guys: it doesn't impress our lady when the waiter says bluntly that our wine selection is inappropriate
) I won't be back
My husband and I went out with a group of friends last night to One if by Land, Two if by Sea eagerly anticipating an amazing experience via Restaurant Week
While our dinner reservation was for 9 p
m
, we were not seated until after 9:30 p
m
Drinks were steep ($10 for well drink, $12 for wine), the beautiful ambience was ruined by the loud chatter and lack of air conditioning, and too close for comfort seating
The portion sizes are tiny so don't go there hungry
My husband and I thought the food was very average considering its reputation and acclaimed high caliber
There are certainly other restaurants to consider for great food and environment, with better prices
Finally got the chance to go to OIBL and was disappointed
Table for 3 was right in the corner near the hostess in an small alcove
Decor was fancy but not enough to carry the place
Portions were TINY
Don't go on an empty stomache
When the crab cake appetizer came out it was so tiny I assumed it was a tart that many restaurants provide w/ the meal
The pork was good but 3 small medalians and 2 tablespoons of mashed potatos does not make a meal
Figuring I had calories to spare for dessert I had the chocolate fondrant but it was too bitter
Stay away from the berries soup
Tasted like an ice pop in the microwave with a few berries for garnish
When the check came we were rushed to leave
Was still hungry! Glad I went so I know not to go again
I was disappointed by the food at One if By Land
I know this place is known for being romantic, but I would naturally assume that flavorful food would be encompassed in it's romantic allure
Not so much
For an $80 prix fixe menu, I received only $40 worth of food
The food wasn't anything stellar -- nothing that couldn't be found at a less hyped restaurant
The servers were very helpful and attentive, though
I wouldn't exert the effort to dine here -- similar restaurants can be found at half the hype and without the hassle
This restaurant has been touted as one of the most romantic restaurants and one of the best but it is far from it
Yes it has a piano (but stuck near the door and bar so it was barely audible for most tables)
Yes they have candles on the tables but the decor is very old fashion
If you want a place that your grandmother would love then this is the place
I did not like the place because: -it took the waiter over 20 min to take our order and then over an hour until we got our food
-the bread served was cold  -the choices for restaurant week was very slim (no meat dish except pork) -there were no chef's treats or delights -the food was ok but not up to the quality expected There are more exciting, romantic restaurants in the city to visit
Went with my husband for our anniversary and I am so disappointed we wasted a special evening there
The food was terrible--one of the all time worst meals I've ever had in Manhattan
My husband ordered the smoked pork which was basically 3 slices of Virginia Ham
My sea bass was boring bland
My soup tasted like it was out of a can
The creme brulee was one of the most flavorless I've ever had
Although the restaurant has some old world charm and is pretty--it is tired and worn
Went to OIBL/TIBS for my wife's 30th birthday primarily based on the reputation for being romantic and terrific food
First the ambiance - definitely the place to go if you want that old world charm
If you are looking to impress someone with something fancy shmantzy, this is the place
In terms of food - we both felt that with some minor exceptions, the food was not quite at the level expected for a restaurant of this caliber and cost
It was just simply too salty for our taste
However, the shining spot in the experience was the exemplary service
Bottom line - go for the experience, not for food
Everything that can be said about this restaurant has been said
It is beautiful and romantic, and the service and food was incredible
We had an 8pm reservation, were seated promptly, and were not rushed out-we stayed for almost 2 hours
Everything about this place is just amazing
this place is for the bt crowd that goes out once a year
stay away!
My husband and I went to One if By Land to celebrate his birthday
We had been looking forward to visiting this restaurant for years after hearing how it is the most romantic restaurant in New York
While the food was decent and the ambiance nice the service was horrendous
Our waiter was pretty much non-existent and when he did come to our table he practically tossed our plates and wine glasses in front of us
When he saw that we were unsatisfied he asked what's the problem is the service too slow or too fast
Shortly after that we got up and walked out, something we have never done in a restaurant before
I would assume that other waiters in the restaurant have better attitudes, but our waiter completely ruined the experience
the food was GREAT and they have a great selection of wines
But the service was just so so which was a great disappointment because the food and ambience deserve better
service wasn't AWFUL - just not really on their toes
basically, my reservation was at 9:15, they seated us at 9:50, then there was just all this 'non-activity' going on so we didn't order for another 20 minutes - and I was hungry! this 'non-activity' lasted through the night
But overall - worth going to for a good, romantic date - but maybe not worth going to again
Words can't even begin to describe it
The only thing that matters is that it was perfect and she said yes!
We came here expecting the typical choice of Salmon or Chicken for dinner during Restaurant Week, hoping it would not be a bland version for this basic prix fixe meal
We were pleasantly surprised by also having the choice of pork loin which was melt in your mouth delicious
The Gnocchi appetizer was excellent, too
Quantity is small, but quality is great! The Creme Brulee was average, I did not even finish it
Drinks are pricey ($10 for a Stoli O on the rocks, $12 glass of Merlot)
The restaurant was beautiful, the staff was very nice, and we got a great seat near one of the fireplaces
Tables were spaced nicely too, and we were not sitting too close to other diners
I would recommend taking out of town family to this restaurant for a nice dinner out
Last night I was invited by friends to this restaurant
The food was good but overpriced and the decor was a little stodgy
Our waiter was very prompt and friendly, but the worst part of the experience was actually after the meal when I was leaving
I needed change to give the woman at coat check a tip
I stood at the bar waiting patiently for change
The female bartender completely ignored me helping other customers standing next to me and those who came up after me
Finally, after waiting so long my friend lent me money to give the coat check woman
I went to this restaurant last night expecting a romantic setting with above average food
However, I was very pleasantly suprised
Although I didn't have the tasting menu, the food on the prix fixe was excellent
The service was superb, without being pretentious, and the room was goregous
Must try the seven-course tastings are great values

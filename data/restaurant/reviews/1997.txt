Otherwise, would go back! Also surprised to see large stroller with pretty loud baby seated near us
Not a place i'd recommend for small children
Food was good, but not outstanding, and lunch atmosphere is nothing
We may try again for dinner, but the big draw for us would be the stars - the food would not draw us back
(Again, this is all based on lunch only
)
This American Brasserie is one of my perennial favorites - the food is always good, the service is always warm and gracious, and the restaurant is really beautiful
I love the original loft details and the central bar, which is always the perfect place for a drink with friends
It's always exciting to see celebrities hiding in the corner banquettes or behind sunglasses at the bar, but the real draw is the chef's short ribs and the volumous wine list
I regularly eat at Tribeca Grill not only for the great atmosphere and professional go out of their way staff, but because the food is excellent
My most recent trip to the Grill was this past friday night where me and a friend were dazzled by the bartenders excellent wine recommendation
Only inteding to stay for one drink we ended up spending the evening at the bar eating, drinking, and talking
The scene was great, I highly recommend!
The crowd was on the older side and the scene was a little less trendy than most reviews I've read
The service was good, but the food was mediocre
After ordering, we received our food in less than 3 minutes, which leads me to believe that it was prepared ahead of time
I would not recommend the place to anyone, sorry
New York has much better choices for dining out
Tribeca Grill is still rocking with its cool crowd and downtown charm
The food is very tasty - grilled meats are the specialty and they execute with a sure hand from Chef Stephen Lewandowski
I loved the grilled duck and the honey mustard glazed quail, while my boyfriend tried the charcuterie plate and the tasty garganelli pasta with short ribs
Most of all I loved the vibe running through the room - relaxed and comfortable while still being refined
Dining there might be a different experience but the food is nothing special
Nice location and probably a great place to go in the summer, but not memorable
We went here after reading many of the reviews here on our 10th anniversary and my first trip to NYC
The food was good, the roasted apple dessert is sublime
The service was efficient and good, but lacked warmth
Our server never even gave us her name, however, she was good
THe food was a bit over priced, but perfectly cooked
All and all, I will try something else when I go back
I had a better time in some of the less talked about resteraunts
Tribeca Grill wowed me over when I went there for dinner
It wasn't too sceney, and it had great old-world atmosphere with a downtown edge
The food was terrific: perfectly seasoned, tender grilled steak, crunchy and delicious shrimp tempura, FABULOUS short ribs, sumptous cheeses
The wines were delicious and the selection was amazing
We tried a great Syrah that we really enjoyed, and splurged on a Chateauneuf du Pape
The staff was very nice, especially the tall, charming manager who gave us a great table at the corner banquette
Wasn't sure what to expect in going here
honestly, my expectations weren't that high, worried about the celebrity owner phenomenon
However, from the moment I walked in, I loved the embracing, casual, neighborhood feel of the place
And as a wine lover, the huge list, and more importantly, friendly knowledgable wine service were the clincher
The food is a great foundation for the whole experience
Food was really really good!, Services was fast and detailed - someone there all the time to help
and the Wine list was extensive with good selections
I also sat at the bar to start and ordered a couple of drinks - Service at the bar was fast and drinks where well made
I had a great time here last week
The wine list might be the best in the city, 45 pages long with tons of great values
I found some rare wines on the list that I paid more for at the wine store
The sommelier was very friendly and knowledgeable, he helped me pick out a great bottle that I had not had before
I was very impressed, and the food was great as well
I had the duck, it was grilled perfect
My wife had the lamb, also very good
My husband and I wandered in after a long morning walk
He had the ravioli with artichoke hearts, spinach and tomotoes, which was actually very good, but way to expensive for lunch pasta
I had the leg of lamb sandwich and it was not at all what I expected
First, it was served ice cold, I requested that it be warmed up and the waiter brought it back telling me to beware because the sandwich was very hot
Well, it was barely luke warm
To me, lamb should never be served up cold
I probably won't return as there are too many fantastic restaurants to try and try again
Excellent food quantity
Left feeling very satisfied
Pricey, but that's to be expected
The fixed price dinner was quite good
Sean (our waiter) was totally accommodating and very cool with our group our humorous nature
Very casual place for dining late at night
Will be back
A group of friends and I went to Tribeca Grill to celebrate a birthday
The food was FABULOUS - especially the short ribs mmmm :)
The people there were very attentive and friendly
This is definitely a place I would highly recommend!
We celebrated a friend's 30th birthday here
The place was crowded, but it wasn't a long wait for our table
The food was very good, although some portions were small
I would recommend Tribeca Grill and would go back
Great place for a celebration dinner
Friendly and responsive staff
Great food with appropriately sized portions
Fabulous, cozy atmosphere
Highly recommend
Original food (even refined for some meals), good quality and nice portions
Impressive list of wine
Great service
This is not a noisy place despite of the appearances
Went for my friends birthday
It is such a nice quiet place to go, very cozy and homey
The staff was really nice and very welcomming
The food was amazing
Definately go again
Can hold big groups of people
Make reservations though
Can get booked easily
Understandibly so
a place that if it depended on the food and service it would not be so popular
pure hype
very disappointing dinner (and pricey), the waiter was a ghost and the only highlight of the evening was the wine
which we had to continuously beg to have refilled
I read a few Citysearch user reviews before visiting, and was worried that I'd come out hungry
Don't worry about it: portion sizes are fine
The meal was pretty good, with a few misses (shrimp tempura: bland) and some great surprises (charcuterie plate: the foie-gras was so-so, but the chicken liver was flawless and delicious)
They have a great list of wines by the glass, and a good cheese selection

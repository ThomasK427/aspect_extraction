Our friends were early, checked in, and waited for us at the bar
Traffic was terrible, I called to say we'd be late
The hostess was very understanding
I arrived 10 minutes after our reservation, and my husband 10 more, after parking
We went to the Host to be seated and he rudely said our table had been given away! Knowing they were at the bar! We requested the manager and he did his best to get us a table
We sat down 30 minutes later
The waiter was pushing the most expensive items and was no where to be found throughout the course of our meal
When the food arrived--it was cold
Not lukewarm, but cold! We live in NYC where restaurant choices are abundant
No need to ever revisit this one!
my friends and i went to blt prime to celebrate a birthday
with nearly 15 years of collective experience of living in nyc, we agreed that it had the worst service we've ever experienced
our waiter was flaky and unattentive
he was more interested in the people at the table cramped next to us, and turned to talk to them while i was mid-order
he then became belligerent after we complained to the somelier
later, wine was spilled on my friend's suede jacket as a result of the waiter's rush to avoid us
even after complaining to two managers, very little was done
we were offered free pie, which seemed rather meek at 1130pm when it would be thrown out anyway
in the weeks since, my friend has tried unsuccessfully to have management reimburse her for the coat
the food here is good, but the overall experience is not worthwhile
Went to BLT Prime with my husband last night
What a treat
I wasn't even in the mood to go out and this place turned me around
The ambiance was so cool and comfortable
I loved the huge menu on the wall and the open kitchen
And the tables were just close enough that we could have friendly conversation with the tourists on our right and completely ignore the annoying high-roller types on our left
I had the filet with Bernaise and it was delicious; my husband had roast chicken that was so juicy and flavorful
The sides were fantastic
the creamed spinich, while seemlingly boring, was incredible
So were the morel mushrooms and the leek potato pancake
Dessert was whatever
Probably the weakest link, but I'm not a dessert person
Also not a fan of the chicken liver pate amuse
Go here for a casual night out
you won't regret it
The atmosphere is perfect! the most comfortable steakhouse I have ever been in
Dim,and classy
The food was very good
You have your basics steaks and more
Roasted chicken, a few fish dishes,lobster and shrimp too
They have a sauce menu to add to the meats to customize your dish
Love that idea! The maitre d' was very kind and helpful
Even great garlic bread!
after being seated at a beautiful table, we were excited to try this restaurant
we completed our cocktails long before the waiter brought our starters (which did not come until 30 minutes after we had been seated)
we took 2-3 bites of the appetizer when the entrees arrived
the tuna was VERY overcooked
the $40 filet was cold
the server could not be found again to tell her about the poor entrees
the wine steward could not recommend a wine from their list to accompany the desserts we selected
the waiter was unable to identify whether certain cheeses from the cheese course were cow or goat milk
the waiter started making excuses when we asked for a pen to leave comments on their comments card
we wanted to love this place but were awfully disappointed and will never go back
This place was recomended to me and some friends
The menu reads well, and it sounds like the chef knows whats up
Our server was not present at all
He was enjoying running around and chit chatting with his friends
When the food arrived, the portions were really small, and didn't really reflect the awesome descriptions on the menu
Thanks to the bus boy who basically took over our table, and helped us out while our waiter was no where to be found
We took a chance with this place and got burned
I'm sure it can be good though, just a little fine tuning
what a wonderful meal
everything house made, fresh fresh fresh
I've eaten there quite a few times and noticed many seasonal changes on the menu each time
loved the pasta special with sage pesto (nice variation), loved the house made sausages
tried the lambs tongue with trepidation, but it was really tasty
best steak and fries in a long time
my partner's monkfish was lovely
really yummy ricotta fritters and chocolate
got a bit loud towards the end of the meal when it filled up
sidewalk tables available, but I preferred to sit inside next to the window
When we arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday it was nearly empty, but we were seated next to the door and had to ask to be moved
We liked the bare brick, candle-lit atmosphere
The waitress heavily promoted an appetizer special pasta sheets with pesto but it was an over-cooked mushy mess overloaded with pignolia nuts and not enough basil-garlic flavor
The chicken sausage appetizer and fennel-blood orange salad were both very good
Entrees: the medium-rare hangar steak arrived rare instead with heavily salted fries
They disappeared anyway
The monkfish (not the one reviewed in Citysearch) was okay, but the special trout was truly divine
The 1995 Super Tuscan ($47) was elegant and restrained, but unfortunately lacked the fruit driven flavor we expect from this kind of wine
We skipped dessert
All in all, not bad, but not a wonderful meal either
In a word, Uovo is uneven
My boyfriend and I ate there the other night, and it was surprisingly dead inside
The menu was interesting, and I thought at first that it was a little overpriced, but our meals were well worth it
We started with sweetbread poppers, a little rich for my taste but my boyfriend loved them, as well as a couple other appetizers (the ricotta dumplings were delicious)
I went after checking the place out here, and I got the brisket and my boyfriend got the pork chop--- both were amazing
Our server were sweet and attentive and she even helped us match a wine for our meal
It's not typical of ave
B, and as the previous person mentioned, it's probably not the best place for vegetarians, but I still definitely reccomend it
So I order a white omelette am told no way not even for xtra $
Fine, I try french toast a romaine salad with no bacon
At which I'm told, once again, nope the Chef won't do it
I look incredulously at the waitress ask for the owner
after asking a 2nd waitress the owner comes over as we're finishing our tiny portions, and after arguing with me she says that I could've easily taken off the bacon since it's just 1 piece so I reply then you can easily take it off right? she says no, lecturing me about her husband's integrity as a chef
this was the most inflexible place I've ever been to in the E
V
The owner/chef duo ought to be reminded that artforms meant to be ingested must allow for dietary exceptions and some wiggle room
Or get off Avenue B
The food was original and delicious
We were seated promptly (even though our complete party wasn't there) and the service was great

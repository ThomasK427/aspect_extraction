50 for a small glass of soda??? Are you kidding me???
The food was great! The tortellini with the green peas was amazing! The staff was friendly
No attitude at all! Great date place
I've walked by the place a few times but have ignored it because of the red awning
I'd imagine that most people would just ignore it, which is a shame
I stopped in on a Saturday night for a drink and was pleasantly surprised
Not crowded, good mix of people (some gay, some straight, mostly late 20s early 40s just stopping by)
I can't recommend the food, since we didn't go for dinner
But I can see going back for a laid back meal or a drink with friends
They always have a few fish entrees to choose from and go a little early so you can sit at the bar and munch on their homemade chips
Porters is a rare find in Manhattan; the food and service are excellent yet the prices are quite reasonable
Their salmon, crabcakes, and salads are delicious and all the offerings are well-presented
The waiters are attentive and avoid the fakeness and attitude that you find in many restaurants
You could certainly take a date to Porters for a romantic evening; however, the atmosphere is laid back enough that my best friend and I go wearing jeans
In Short This Chinese restaurant has proven so popular, it's spawned multiple outposts, and this Hell's Kitchen version is thought to be the best
Decor varies from location to location, with photos of Mao Tse-Tung making occasional appearances
Menus also vary, though most break down into Sichuan, Hunan, and "American Chinese Food" sections
Sichuan should be the main draw, with basics like smoked tea duck and double cooked pork available alongside more intriguing dishes like sliced conch and "Bad Smell Bean Curd
"
HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! I have read numerous reviews on this place, quoting what great Chinese food they have
This is my fourth try over a two year period, and I'm done
(I've ordered from the 2nd ave
location twice, and the Hell's Kitchen location twice
) The spicy eggplant was DOUSED in oil, the chicken was dry, oily, and tasted like bad chicken from Chinatown
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever
Don't waste your time, or money!!
As I made the title, it's an affordable restaurant for great taste
I usually order Fried Rice, Shrimp with Sichuan Sauce, some appetizers cooked/marinated with Sichuan peppers
Mmmm! Staffs are not that friendly, but the taste covers all
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant
Try ordering from the regular menu, then you would not regret!
We've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner
We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty
I've had the chicken with garlic sauce, chicken with black bean sauce, and hunan chicken
All pretty good
Grand Sichuan has the most authentic Sichuan food I've had in NY (including Flushing and Chinatown)
if you're a fan of real sichuan food then you should go here, don't order like the regular run of the mill americanized stuff (if you're confused ask the waiter)
the food is very good
Great food
Unspeakably rude delivery
I made a delivery order for lunch, they called back and made me order more to make it worth the delivery
Order ended up being double the price of a normal lunch
I gave the delivery man 15% tip, which I thought was fine especially since I spent twice as much as I had planned, and the guy became apoplectic
Made a total scene in the office
Do yourself a favor and skip this one
I'll still go to other locations where they know how to treat customers
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip
Avoid this place!
Supposedly their food is pretty good
But we only saw terrible Service and gruff staff
With delivery they left out my rice
Called again for rice the lady asked me to buy something to worth a delivery
Second time around me and coworker ordered same pork, one fat and one lean
They asked us to decide on the same so that they could make it together
Third colleage's Very Little Oil vegetables were swimming in lardy oil
And the pork they churned out tasted funny, uneditable toss-aways
So in essence we were eating 6-dollar white rice
Again, supposedly their food is pretty good
But we tried it and it was bad
Who knows, you might get lucky, you brave gambler you
We got there at 5:45pm with one other table already served and found it MOST difficult to get any service
It continued to be like this the WHOLE meal
The dimsum/dumplings were mostly average to below and the main courses
eh?  Don't bother
I live in the neighborhood and eat here once/week
This is as good as it gets unless you go to one of those fancy shmancy chinese places that I don't even enjoy
This place is not only good but clean, quick, and you can feel good about bringing a date or a friend here
Probably one of the best Szechuan/Chinese restaurants outside of Chinatown/Flushings/Elmhurst
Definitely tops in midtown
If you like spicy food this is the place to beat
Popular with both locals, Chinese nationals who work at the embassy nearby and anyone who knows authentic Chinese food from the moogoogaipan Americanized slop no self-respecting Chinese cuisine lover we be caught dead at
Definitely worth a visit!
The food is probably the best sichuan food you can get in NYC
Event Flushing or Chinatown fail to offer this kind of good stuff
The food is great
spicy! However, we, a party of 6, were rushed to order our food, then rushed to eat, rushed to pay, and rushed to finish our orange slices and fortune cookies
As we were leaving the restaurant, we noticed two other large tables available with no one waiting
Would not return because of such rushed service!
The atmosphere made me think the prices were going to be slightly higher than some of the chinese restaurants in the area
However, I got an order of eggplant with garlic sauce (and couldn't finish it because the portion was so large) for just over seven dollars
The sauce was fabulously spicy
I have tried many other restaurants but so far this is my favorite
The Scene Just stepping into this steakhouse feels naughty; nude female silhouettes grace the wallpaper and napkins, burlesque stars smile from photos on the wall, and blood-red lighting lends the restaurant a seductive glow
Groups of older, moneyed clientele sit listening to the day's specials from attentive, formally dressed waiters
The Food Satiate your culinary cravings with a pair of jumbo sea scallops, which are pan-seared to crispy perfection on the outside, leaving the inside to melt decadently in the mouth
The standout entree is the New York strip steak
Cooked exactly to specifications, its tender interior and peppery outside meld seamlessly with the roasted garlic and steak sauce
Even the sides are lusty: The creamed spinach gets kissed with a pleasant hint of black truffles
For one last indulgence, order the grand chocolate profiterole--creamy milk chocolate and bittersweet ice cream stuffed in a slightly bready puff pastry and topped with streams of chocolate syrup
In a place with such a reputation and such prices, you would expect a MUCH better steak quality
The strip was just above average and rather medium-rare cooked instead of rare (in such an expensive steak house, when you order rare, you expect rare, nothing else)
If the prices were half of what they are, the experience would be very satisfactory, because the place looks and feels great
But with the existing price/quality level, I don't think so
Went last night with a group of 8 and had a great experience
Started with oysters on the half shell, clams casino (very good but small), and salad

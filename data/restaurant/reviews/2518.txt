But, after a few drinks, anything tastes good
Mustang is excellent, you should have no worries when you eat at this establishment
Very relaxed atmosphere, you could hang out, eat, have a couple of drinks and really enjoy your stay
Friendly waitstaff, no worries
Check out Mustang the very next chance you get
My girlfriend and went there for dinner last week and spent the entire night
We started out at the bar, then had an amazing dinner
We then headed to the cigar lounge for a smoke and dessert and finished the night off in the downstairs lounge, which I never knew existed
The couches are pretty cozy
Very good food and great drinks at reasonable prices
Management is the best too
They really make you feel at home
my girlfriend and i hang out a lot at the bar in the lounge
we get very excited but management wont let us dance on the bar! i guess you just have to relax and enjoy a chicken quesadilla (my favorite) and a martini
WHAT MORE CAN I SAY, I HAD GREAT BREAD (LOVED THOSE PUMPKIN MUFFINS AND MEXICAN BREAD) GREAT TAMALES AND A NICE LOBSTER CAKE SPECIAL AND I COULDNT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THE BANANA CREAM PIE WAS
PRICES WONT BREAK THE BANK EITHER
good food, great margaritas, ok prices, big place and hot decor
MUSTANGS LIKE A SOHO REST/LOUNGE
PRICES ARE PERFECT FOR THE NEIGBORHOOD
WE ARE ALWAYS IMPRESSED HOW FRESH THE SEAFOOD AND HOW NICELY THEY PRESENT THEIR FANCY MEXICAN FOOD
DECOR IS COOL WITH COMFY ROOMS TO LOUNGE IN AFTER A MEAL
YOU MUST TRY A EXOTIC MARGARITA
OVER ALL, FAR ABOVE THE RICE BEANS, BAD TEQUILA YOU GET FROM MOST MEXICAN PLACES
THE FOOD COMPARES WELL WITH ALL THE OTHER FANCY RESTAURANTS ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE BUT YOU PAY LESS (NO STUFFY MAITRE'DS AND MONOTONOUS WHITE TABLECLOTHES)
THE PLACE HAS BEEN BUSY SO LONG THAT THE BIG CROWDS WHO GO THERE MUST LOVE DINING IN A PLACE THAT SEEMS LIKE ITS ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING A FULL BLOWN MARDI GRAS
THE WINTER MONTHS ARE REALLY NICE BECAUSE THE WAITS FOR TABLES ARE NOT LIKE CAFE SEASON
JUST CHILL THERE AND FORGET ABOUT THE RECESSION!
MUSTANG GRILL IS GREAT!! IT'S PERFECT FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
TAKE A DATE OR CHILL OUT WITH SOME FRIENDS
CERTAINLY THE BEST NEIGHBORHOOD SCENE ON THE WEEKENDS AND THEY ALSO HAVE A GREAT BRUNCH
FOOD IS GREAT AND THE MARGARITAS KICK ASS!!!
ONE OF THE FEW BAKERIES THAT STILL BELIEVES IN EXCELLANCE! THE BEST SCHNECKEN, BROWNIES, BLACK WHITES AND THEIR BUTTER COOKIES ARE TO DIE FOR, AND THEY NOW HAVE A WEB SITE AND SHIP ALL OVERTHE U
S
I really enjoy their delicious apple strudle and raspberry tartes
They can bake! The aromas streaming out the door are alluring! You are sure to stop in and peruse
Don't expect a wide selection or upper east side treatment
They aren't custumer service oriented

I you should check your bill, I have on two occasions been overcharged
$20 plus dollars for a pound of cookies!!! This place is highly overpriced and just as highly overrated
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
This one is just fine
Decent coffee, expensive espresso-drinks and OK customer service
They are all the same
How could such a lovely place in an ideal setting be so disappointing? It comes down to one thing: service
The problem: there is no service
The scene: one bartender and loads of people, some of whom voiced their frustration
I felt sorry for the bartender as he could not possibly keep up
What I found most astonishing was that while so many businesses struggle and work so hard to keep a business going, the Loeb Boathouse does not seem concerned in the least
We were insulted by the lack of service and left within minutes
My husband and I were in NYC for an anniversary weekend in October of last year, and to celebrate we booked a Central Park Goldola ride, which departs from the Boathouse
After the magical ride (thank you andres) we had drinks at the bar--the wine list was great, the bar staff was friendly and efficient
When they found out it was our anniversary , they bought our drinks
Who says you have to go south for hospitality? Later we ran into some of the staff at another restaurant, and they struck up a conversation
We have been back to the Boathouse since and the food was great--how could it not be looking out over Bethesda Terrace? Go to the Boathouse and take it all in as soon as possible, you won't regret it
The setting is unbelievable- in central park on the shore of the lake
Unfortunately everything else went wrong
We ordered a fruit and cheese plate, which came out looking like it'd been sitting around for hours
When I pointed this out to the waitress, she gave me a dirty look, but took it back to the kitchen- then brought out another plate that looked the same way
This was followed with inedible fried calamari
The only saving grace was the manager, who apologized and gave us a break on the bill
I had people in from out of town, 8 in total - Boathouse will not take reservations
Come at 11 they say, no problem
We arrive at 11:07 and are asked Reservations? (guess VIPs get reservations)
They said 20 minutes
We were sat at 12:45pm -- it was embarrassing and unfair
The waiter service was terrible, I had to ask for coffee 3 or 4 times each time I wanted a refill
The food is undeniably good -- but not worth the wait
I feel they know there is a line behind you so they don't need to treat you well, because someone is willing to take your table
I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant
I believe it is the most romantic dining spot in New York City
For birthday or anniversary, it can't miss
The food is fantastic, the decor is beautiful, the setting can't be beat
The service is attentive and friendly
For an enjoyable and unforgettable experience with the one you love, you absolutely cannot go wrong here
With an amazing ambience, good service and great weekend brunch what else can you ask for
Try the crab cakes
Reservations are a must
A very pretty setting to have a meal, but unfortunately the service and food don't match the atmosphere
For the price range charged ($10 - 15 appetizers, $16 - 25 entrees) the food is merely adequate but nothing outstanding or memorable
The service on our visit was absolutely awful - a waiter and two helpers couldn't get our orders right and ignored several pleas for basics such as water and beverage refills and utensils to eat desserts with
It's a romantic and memorable location, but don't go there for any other reason
If the weather's right and it's one of those perfect summer evenings when being in Central Park reminds you why you love this city, dinner at the Boathouse Cafe can be magical
Service is friendly but leisurely, and the foof the night we went was mostly superb: The shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked, the salads light and perfectly dressed, the crab cake appetizer the best I've had in NYC, the lobster exquisite
The sirloin steak was inedible - but everything else was so good we were ready to overlook it
And the setting is one of a kind
When the weather is right, there may not be a more beautiful spot to dine in New York
Expensive, but worth every cent
I have lived in the neighborhood for 2 years and this is one of the only Italian restaurants I will eat at - the food is consistently great, the service is always friendly and refreshing, and the price is on par for a solid pasta dish in NYC
The Norma pasta dish is my favorite - always great! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone
There is no obvious difference in food quality between this place and any number of other pasta places on the Upper East Side, but there is a difference in price
Nothing we had was bad, but neither was anything above average, and the prices are definitely above average
We won't be back
The crespollini appetizer is addictive
The owners used to have their own family vineyard (not sur eif they still do), but in previous years, if you are there the right season you may be able to order thier very own Sangiovese
Try the salads-tasty! And the gnocchi is surprisingly light
Great little neighborhood spot

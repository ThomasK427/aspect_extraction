Also, the place is kind of small and often there is a wait but it is well worth it as you will enjoy the best neighborhood sushi place in the city
I don't even like Tuna, and I never order tuna specifially at a sushi place, unless they come with the dish
Here, they have Blue Fin Tuna, which is considered as the best, and the tasty of them all! If you are not a Tuna fan, you truely have to try one of theirs
The restuarant is clean, and staffs are friendly
They really take their food seriously, and professionaly
This place really is closest to the restaurants in Japan for the price
Try Ah Gae Tofu, of of course, miso soup
This make other restuarants' miso soups taste like wet miso in water!
fresh sushi, good service, what more can you ask for?  opens on Sat Sun lunch 1-4 pm
I regularly go to Hasaki because they consistently have very fresh fish that is also extremely flavorful and sweet
You have to try it to believe it, I highly recommend their sashimi
Everyone I have taken there agree that the fish is excellent
Their portions are not the biggest but it is sufficient
The only complaints would be that it is a small restaurant so it can be cramped and the wait may be long on weekends
But it is worth it in my books for good food
The service is good, but nothing to write home about
Prompt and polite
Don't forget to finish off with their amazing green tea ice cream
Call me a loyalist
Everytime I go, Hasaki is a standby of Fresh Sashimi, Sushi, Chirashi, Excellent Shabu Shabu
If you wonder why there's always a line, it's for the impeccable fresh fish
I think the fish is quite fresh and well prepared
The long wait is never fun but more worthwhile at Hasaki than at other sushi restaurants with lines out the door
This place is fantastic
We have recently moved to LA and one of our most missed meals is Rosie's Kung Pao Chicken with a side of pork fried rice
Their food is fresh and of consistently high quality
Delivery is quick and they save addresses via phone number so it's easy to place an order
Only downside is they need to add a larger beer selection
It's slightly more upscale and expensive than a take-out joint, and I don't think it's worth it
I gave them several tries since I work nearby, and they failed to impress me
The food is bland, their sauces taste off (especially the garlic sauce)
It's not as greasy as a regular chinese place, but it's definately not the best choice in an area filled with great restaurants
The food here is amazing
Dont let the homely decor fool you
this is some of the best chinese north of china town
Ive been here more times than i can count and the food is always great
The menu has more than what you will usually find at regular neighborhood chinese places
Waitstaff is really nice and doesnt mind customizing orders
In my opinion, with these prices, its a great value and a reliable (above average) dining experience!
First of all, it's great that this is not just a take-out joint
Secondly, the food is good, the delivery containers hardy, and their egg-drop soup doesn't just taste like slimy chicken soup
Not as greasy as most Chinese in New York
I consider this my favorite Chinese restaurant in the city outside of Chinatown
In a City littered with Chinese restaurants every few blocks, Rosie Ting is definitely above average
The menu includes the usual Chinese restaurant staples, but also includes a fairly diverse selection of other dishes not typically found in your average noodle house
It's surely one of the better values for your money, which is a bit odd considering it's a much nicer place to dine than many Chinese restaurants
I've never had a problem with orders, delivery or in-dine, and the food has always been consistently good, even if it isn't the greatest ever -- but then again, where does one go to find World Class Chinese food?
First, they deliver the wrong order
Without apology, they return with the correct order, which was horrendously B-A-D
(Their General Tsao sauce tastes like Heinz BBQ sauce
)
Intimate place where you can sing into the mike from your seat
$1 per song, plus a two-drink minimum
This place is ideal when there isn't a huge group dominating the scene
I've had wonderful experiences here when people arrive in twos and threes, maybe even fours
people are usually a lot of fun and supportive of one another and a sense of camaraderie ensues
Unfortunately, during my latest visit, a rowdy group of co-workers took over the back area of the bar and the bartenders seemed to favor them by choosing their songs over others seated at the bar
We promptly left, but I can't say I won't be back when the atmosphere is less chaotic
If you're a part of that kind of group, you'll probably love it
If you're into a quieter scene, maybe choose a night early in the week or go earlier in the evening
2/3 people that walk in are recognized by the staff who are friendly and talkative when it's slow and all business when busy (wknd breakfasts)
Standard diner fare that consistently pleases
Ambience does not mean nice decor- this plays has an ambience of its own in that local-diner-where-famous-people-go-to-be-ordinary kind of way
I love going here
The food is really good and the menu is creative!!
This place is great for thick, juicy hamburgers that you can hardly fit into your mouth
They're chicken is decent too, but why would you go to a hamburger joint for chicken? There is nothing special about the place, just a typical hamburger joint with cow designs around
The wait service is average, but the food is deliverd timely
Overall, I would recommend this place for someone who is looking for a really good burger during their lunch break
This is the best real hamburger in New York
Having grown up in Texas, I can attest to the fact that a great burger is hard to find in Manhattan
The hamburgers are juicy and grilled to perfection
They have a large menu of comfort food favorites and as long as you stick to the traditional items you'll be good to go
This is not the place to order eggs florentine
Go to a little cafe or bistro for that type of stuff
The menu has just about everything under the sun, and the food is delicious
Every time the waitress walked by with food, I found myself drooling
Once I got a taste of my quesedillas and greek salad I was extremely impressed! I can't say much about the ambiance since I sat outside, but I enjoyed the sidewalk, people-watching section
Service was ok, prices were pretty decent
The food was acceptable, but the ambiance was so lame; cheesy menu and unacceptably packed
You're better off going to a standard diner to get basics like burgers and fries
Great philly cheesesteak sandwich and all of the breakfast foods are good
Portions are large, especially the hamburgers
Decoration is OK, service is good
A real all-American experience! Burgers, fries, the works - what Johnny Rocket's wishes he could be! Greasy but tasty - everyone's happy when they chow down at Silver Spurs! Have some fun!
Amazing menu
Great food
Spectacular service
Great location
Reasonably priced
What more can you ask for?? I got the chili which was the best I ever had
Highly recomend it!
The menu is HILARIOUS, and the burgers are big, juicy
a DELIGHT! I take all my visitors to tomoe sushi and silver spurs
The burgers are giant and really good
They'll have every type of burger any way you want it
My favorite is the Western Union
The sides are good too like the red potato salad
I love this place
I stop in everytime I'm in the village

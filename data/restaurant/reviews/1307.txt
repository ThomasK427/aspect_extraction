They sat us (me and my lady friend) down and took us away from there
fine service, delicious appetizers and entrees, outstanding wine list with a hip and friendly crowd
they even comp'd us a desert
Fillip's came as a reccomendation and i'll have to do the same
check it out!
The wine list is a steal!! Great wines with little mark-up
The Foie Gras with pistachio was wonderful
Main entres were priced just right, and the cheese course although limited was great
When I first found Fillip's it was winter and I stumbled in out of the cold into a warm inviting atmosphere
Since then I have been back many times and it keeps getting better! They have always had an extensive wine list but now they have a sexy wine guy that will lead you to food pairings that make the already luscious food explode with flavor! There is a wine for everyone and with the selection by-the-glass I love tasting a couple with each meal
The fresh fish dishes are my favorites since the flavors are so well-balanced and not overwhelming
The waitstaff is so gracious I feel like family, the whole experience has me coming back for more, especially now that there is a brunch on weekends too!
A gem of a restaurant tucked away next to the fabulous Champignon Coffee Shop! The wine list offers a surprising variety of wines by the glass and well-priced bottles for every taste
I had a 1995 Baron de Pichon-Longueville bordeaux that I would never expect to find for under $100 and it was outstanding
The handsome and inviting Sommelier enhances the experience by matching your tastes with the food for some of the most amazing combinations I have enjoyed
The service is excellent and unobtrusive and the number of neighborhood regulars is a testimony to the quality and value you will find at Fillip's
Weekend brunches have just been added - I am going for Mother's Day and can't wait!
Fillip's newly renovated space and new menu is indeed a palate pleaser
We had delicious fresh fish, moist, well seasoned and presented
The staff was attentive and service good throughout our dinner
Desserts are a must, accompanied by a tasty brewed decaf
A highly recommended spot for a dining experience and relaxing respite
My date and I had appetizers which were rather boring
I had the pea soup which was bland and he had the duck salad which is not recommended
My swordfish was extremely salty and so was his fish
I could barely finish half of it
Service missed the mark, being either too pushy and not attentive when they should have been
The ambience was warm and nicely decorated, but other than that, I will definitely not be going back
I had the pre-theater prie fixe menu, consisting of Carmelized Onion Soup with lamb, Roasted Free-Range Chicken with Risotto, and Warm Chocolate Cake
I had enjoyed the combination of the salty onion broth with the gamey lamb
The chicken was moist and tender, and the Chocolate cake was exquisite
The service exceeded my expectations
The team at Fillips was very attentive, extremely professional, and made us feel right at home
Definitely recommend going there again!
Excellent food, ambieance, and service
From the unique apetizers to the fine wine selection, Felipps is ideal for a first date or simply a romantic evening out
Fillip and his brother Jesse have created a fine dining experience here in Chelsea
my friends and i are always looking for a classy restaurant in the chelsea area, and we found Fillip's on citysearch and we fell in love
the food is absoloutely the best thing ever
the service and whole decor is impecible and flawless
i cant rave about it more
if you want good service and a classy meal definatly go to Fillip's
Don't forget about their fine wine assortment!
I love this restuarant
I'd eat here everyday of the week if I could afford it! :-) Delicious food and wonderful desserts
It is one of the most romantic and cozy restaurants i ate in NYC
The food is delicious,French cuisine with a big variety of wines and cheese
The appetizers were delightful
and all the rest
All at a good price!!!I had a perfect service
I went in with my lady friend and as soon as we sat we were aproached by our waiter
We had the Foie Gras (a little expensive) and it was out of this world
After we had the Lamb and the Breast of Duck
we shared and all I can say is; we will  GO BACK!!!!! The whole time we could not touch the bottle of wine, the waiter would pour after every  3 or so sips
Great little restaurant
This place is sooooo great! Fillips was PERFECT for brunch!! absolutely delicious, my girlfriends and I were thrilled :) So I went back with a date and it was such a terrific and romantic spot
great ambience and scrumptious food! the cherry on top was that the staff at Fillips was the best
friendly and really on the ball
we loved it! All I can say is that Fillips is yet even more proof that Chelsea just keeps getting better and better!! GO!
This restaurant is so well-needed in an area of lots of great affordable food, and a handful of trendy options
Cafe Filip has an ambience that contrasts the flash and bang of lots of Chelsea's more established eateries with romantic ease and intimacy, and the food puts it in the ranks of the Red Cat and Bottino
If you're in the neighborhood and looking to break out of the hustle and bustle and relax into a classic fine dining experience, this is it
I went with a group of 4 for two of our friends' birthday this summer and it was a wonderful experience
I made a reservation just two days in advance and when I asked about a tasting menu, the waiter actually faxed it to me! The restaurant is small, but there's a nice, warm ambiance - perfect for a girls night out
Try the butterfish - it came out toward the end of our tasting menu, but it was so amazing that each of us finished it! The waiter was attentive to us the whole night, as were the owner and the chef who each came around to ask us of our experience
Will definitely try again!
We found this place on this site
After reviewing the menu and reviews, we decided to give it a try
Just so happen it was my sister's birthday
We took her there with a bunch of our friends
We were seated right away
The appetizers were a bit small, but full of taste
Our entrees were served immediately
A delicious and beautiful looking meal
The pinot noir the waiter recommended was wonderful (easy on the eye as well)
We all loved this place
A little small restaurant with full of flavor
Highly recommended!
There are few good restaurants in Chelsea on 7th Avenue between 20th St 30th St, and Fillip's is not only good but excellent
The food is top-notch
This chef, whom I've met a few times now, is well-schooled and comes out and talks to the customers to get feedback on the food
The dishes are fresh, inventive, well-presented, and tasty
And the pricing is quite reasonable
Proprietor Fillip truly cares, the place is not packed (yet!), and you'll enjoy the well-decorated space
We did the tasting menu with wine here
it was a near-perfect meal, and a great bargain compared with similar menus around Manhattan
Despite being super-busy, service was excellent, and I would absolutely go back
The food, service, decor can not be beat
This place is top notch
His creativity goes beyond anything I've ever seen
Per Se quality, without the bite in the wallet
I'm still living the experience
My wife and I recently went for dinner at Fillip's and we were very surprised at what we found
The food was exceptional
We are glad to find a place that serves really great food without having to make a reservation a month in advance
We had the tasting menu and it was well worth it
The chef/partner even helped us pick out a great bottle of wine and we found the wine prices wonderful
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ESTABLISHMENT
The food, wine and atmosphere are outstanding
You should come here before word gets out and it's impossible to get a reservation!

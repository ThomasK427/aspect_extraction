The waiters are very attentive
The food is also very decently priced, and the food itself is delicious
I've dined here several times as a big group and as a table for two
I've never had issues with reservations, service, or food
Authentic Indian cuisine served avant-garde style; this upscale restaurant is a breath of fresh air
This has to be one of the best Indian places I've ever been to
The service was impeccable - I felt like I was back in India
The food was excellent - the portions were satisfying, but the taste was great
The atmosphere was elegant as well
The one thing I liked the best was that the service was good
The special drinks are absolutely delicious
This is not an ordinary Indian restaurant
I was totally surprised and delighted
I recommend SURYA to anyone who is tired of the usual Indian food and want something fresh and delicious
This truly is one of my favaorite Indian restaurants
Not only is the food amazing, but the atmosphere and friendly staff make the experience memorable
We had the jhinga balchau shrimp and vegetable rolls for appetizers which were delectable
The chicken chettinad and bhuna ghosh served for the main course were perfectly seasoned and flawlessly complemented the basmati rice and garlic naan
For dessert, we had the gulab jamun and malai kulfi which ended the meal superbly
The service was excellent and we can't wait to go back
I was there another night the food was amazing the service was wonderfull and the whole experience was marvelous
They have a great backyard garden I love thier special drinks I been to so many Indian restauraunts in the city and so far Surya is the best
I have been to many Fancy resteraunts in NYC, but never have I seen so many stars around
I was there last Friday when The Million Dollar Baby comes in with her Oscar
On a few other occasions I have seen Eric Stoltz, and a few more celebs
This place is quite different from most Indian places I have eaten in and I love the atmosphere
The food is well spiced and is amply portioned
The martinis are great and so is the service
Raj and Romy (the owners) are always there and are great hosts, if you feel lie being pampered, GO !!!
Good food for delivery and sitdown
Worth a visit
Good indian food that doesn't weight you down after
Surya is an example of how a great small restaurant should be
Simple yet asthetically pleasing decor, GREAT food that is moderately priced, and an attentive wait staff
The nan and chicken masala is to die for
The specialty drinks are quite good but, I would stay away from the wine which is overpriced
My husband is Indian, and we frequently dine here for authentic Indian food
We even take our picky family here, and they enjoy the food as well
Great service, nice decor, and the food is consistently excellent
A cozy and comfortable atmosphere make for a great dining experience
I have loved this restaurant from the first time Ive gone there and now everytime I visit New York
Not only is the food the best, but also the service is more personal and efficient then anyone Ive experienced
The food is as authentic as in India, please by all means ask them to spice it up to India levels
they would happily do it for you
The Chettinad and the Sundal are my favourites, the cocktails are unlike any youve ever had, and the mango ice cream is a great end
Try the garden out back in the summer, you wont believe youre in the West Village
Bon appetite !
I have to say, having eaten at numerous Indian restaurants in the city, this is some of the best Indian food I have ever had
The atmosphere is very nice in this quaint Village hideout
The service is a little wanting but nothing to get upset about
And frankly, to try the food it's worth it
Having visited India and lived in London Surya is the closest Ive found to authentic Indian food in New York
The food is clean, fresh and spiced right
The ambience, service, music are all plus points which help differentiate this spot from the other desi resteraunts in New York
Great martini's and delicious desserts
The garden outback makes this a great spot in the summer
Surya was one of the best India resteraunts in NYC
Right from the time I sat down, everything was perfect, the atmosphere was calm, the service was very curteous, friendly and knowledgeable
My recomendation's would be the Tandoori mix grill and the Chettinad, the grill was simply superb, just the right portions and well spiced, the chettinad was pretty amazing too
The bartender makes a pretty wicked Cosmo, and the desserts are just delish
Nice little find
It was a great experience
The food was excellent and the service was superb
Their Host Romie was very helpful and courteous
He helped us to choose the right dish
Don't miss their appetizer Chicken Tikka and entree Fish Curry
Food was very good
esp
Chicken Chettinad
Serive was helpful, quick, and friendly
Room was nothing special
certainly nothing wrong with it
A little on the pricey side
$16 dollar entres
Good experenice, though
ask for raj
he is a real gem providing excellent hosting
The food was just excellent and was made to order
The presentation of the entrees was gourmet
The service was excellent and the seating was comfortable
From the decor, you couldn't tell it was an Indian Restaurant
The food however, was the closest to traditional as I have tasted in a while
Don't forget to try the specialty drinks!!
the aloo tikkyas was a very good appetizer but I wasn't very happy with the crab cakes, although the sauce for the crab cake was very nice
The lamb vindaloo was delicious
The waitstaff was friendly and the bartender made a great cosmo
The restaurant was not busy when I was there, but it still had a nice feeling
Ate here just last week
If you like indian food, you'll love this place, food is very tasy indeed and the service excellent
The poor reviews listed for this restaurant Im sure must be bogus or from people who have no idea how good Indian food is prepared
The food was overpriced for the portions and quaality
i think they are trying to go for nouveaux indian or something
unfortunately run of the mill flavors prevail on a very limited menu
the home made ice cream was delish though
Surya, is one of my favorite indian restraunts in New York
The service is always impeccable, and food is consistently good
The entrees are all very flavorful, and can be made according to spice
I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy some delicious indian food in a nice cozy atmosphere
Also try the buffet on the weekends for 10 bucks! You honestly can't beat it!
It amazes me that people have been giving this place such high ratings

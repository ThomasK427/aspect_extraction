I've had better French food at Toqueville
I had the chef's menu, which is a nine course meal
Most of the dishes were good, but not exceptional
The rabbit dish was too salty and the rib eye was unexpectedly tough
This was definitely NOT THE BEST meal that I've had in NY by far
It's difficult to fault anything at all at Per Se - the food comes as close to a religious experience I've ever had
Course after course of delicate, crafted dishes, served with an amazing array of some of the best wines I've ever had
It took five hours, the service was absolutely impeccable, and the tour of the kitchen was a eye-opener to how restaurants should operate
Anyone's who read Soul of a Chef will be impressed at how the entire operation functions
Truly unbelievable and worth the price tag
Can't wait to go back
A truly memorable evening - one of the most perfect restaurants I've ever been in
The wait staff was incredible, anticipating our every need unobtrusively
Every dish brought to the table was an absolute gem
The wine list was enormous with plenty of reasonably priced selections
Highlights from the menu were the butter poached prawns, beef with deep fried marrow, the Sentour des Iles, and the Tour au Chocolat, but there was not a single sour note in the evening, and between the 3 of us, I tasted most everything on the menu
Though we opted for the 5 course menu, the kitchen brought so many little treats in between courses that we probably ended up eating 10 courses in all
We were invited to the kitchen for a brief tour and to meet the chef as well
A truly memorable evening - worth every penny!
Despite wanting to die at the end of the meal from being overstuffed, Per Se is a restaurant I wish I could eat at every day! The service is amazing
After dinner we even got a tour of the kitchen
Did I mention the food is amazing?
Definitely great view, great service and food with impeccable preparation
Definitely oustanding effort
Service is good, but not as flawless as in other New York restaurants or even French Laundry in Calif
Unfortunately, this restaurant like all others is not free and this is where the problem lies
~$150 per person for chef's tasting menu is a bit much to ask
I would say, this place is worth a try once and then go some place else
If you have been to French Laundry in Calif
then you may want to skip this one
My dining experience at Per Se is really indescribable
I would recommend it for anyone who has a really special occasion, or just loves to be wined and dined
We were basically waited on hand and foot for almost four hours
Of course that is expected for the prices you pay, but it was nonetheless a wonderful experience
Everything we ate was so flavorful, only a few bites were needed
We weren't rushed, and weren't scoffed at when trying to pick a reasonable priced bottle of wine
Yes there is a dress code, but you don't need to be a snob to eat here
Rich yes
don't listen to the naysayers that have posted
i went here with my grandma for her 80th birthday
it was hands down the best meal i have had in new york city in the past 6 years - and i have had many great meals
if you can get the reservation (call months in advance and expect to get on a waitlist) then absolutely don't miss this restaurant -- and also be prepared to get what you pay for -- a party of three was $800 with tip and we didn't get a bottle of wine or do wine flights
still worth every penny
I have eaten at the French Laundry so I know what Tom Keller is capable of
Althought I thought the food was good, it lacked the surprises of the French Laundry
It also assumes that Per Se diners have not eaten at the FL, as some of the dishes are stepchildren of the FL menu, like Oysters Pearls and the salmon tartare amuse bouche
The courses were served so quickly, I resented shelling out over $600 for dinner
While one plate was being cleared, another was being set
The service was trite, not attentive and frankly cavalier
I am surprised this was all Keller could muster up
If you are at all a foodie, you will be disappointed in this restaurant
I would try and eat at the French Laundry, the food and service will mesmerize you
Otherwise, search in vain for another good restaurant
Try Atelier
I have NEVER been so dissapointed in a celeb-chef's restaurant
The back of the room has absoulutely no view
Extremely rude treatment from the floor manager
The tasting menu was delivered at a break-neck pace, leaving no time to enjoy the wine or even digest the food
After asking them to slow down by the third course, everything came to our table cold, tasteless (or over-salted) and unappealing
Supposedly the best food in NYC
I've had MUCH better at Daniel, Bouley, Ducasse DavidBurke for about half the price! Don't waste your time, money or anticipation eating at Per Se!
probably the most memorable meal i've had in recent memory
the food is expertly crafted and hits every taste sensation perfectly
i still get goosebumps thinking of the tapioca, oyster and caviar appetizer paired with a crisp champagne
the food was phenomenal, and the staff were knowledgeable, efficient and looked like they truly enjoyed what they were doing -- an A+
Get the big tasting menu and wine pairings for a great experience
The price is as high as the quality, so do what we did and don't look at the bill -- much easier to digest on your credit card statement after you've digested your dinner
We had the 5 course tasting menu for lunch which in reality turned into a 9 course 3 hr experience
For example, we were treated with a pre-dessert dessert
Needless to say, there's a reason Thomas Keller is considered the top chef in America
Leading candidate for the best meal I've ever had
And I've had some damn good ones
The Scene Proprietress Paola Bottero, who also owns the excellent Paola's on the Upper East Side, gets a hipper downtown address replete with the culinary skills of Chef Sara Jenkins (who's earned a following of her own in the West Village)
Warm candlelight accompanies the constant wafting smell of good, ripe cheese, while pale slate and exposed brick flank the intimately spaced tables
Service is efficient and no-nonsense but completely unrushed--pretend you're in Tuscany and stay a while
The Food Don't dream of setting foot in here without trying the pasta
The pappardelle with wild boar sauce sells out quickly, but there are plenty of worthy replacements, including the incredibly flavorful pennette with garlic sausage and broccoli rabe
Have a sweet tooth? Your best bet is the rich, chestnut-stuffed ravioli
Meat dishes include tender and lightly seasoned rabbit in tomato sauce, and Colorado lamb
Garlicky shell beans make a good accompaniment
THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING AND REALLY LIVES UP TO ITS HIGH RATING
Always good, I love this place
The food is just sophisticatedly subtle and perfectly prepared
The service is always good and perfectly timed (I hate when I feel rushed)   Also, I never give any Italian restaurant any creditability unless it carries bitters (amaro, Fernet, etc
) and if its really special they carry Mirto (from Sardinia )
These bitters are digestive aids after dinner and are a staple in the Italian dining experience
They have a good selection (Averna, Nonino , Fernet etc
)  The Cavatelli never fails and their meat dishes are always good
If there is one sentence that sums it up -- they let the food speak for itself
Such a hard thing to find these days with sauces and overly seasoned or covered foods most restaurants
Recently enjoyed a delicious birthday dinner here
Nice romantic ambience
Good wine
We loved the greens/parmesan/pear salad
They accidentally gave us old menus, which did not inform my non-mushroom-eating hubby that the asparagus ravioli comes w/ mushrooms in a mushroom sauce
We found that out when it was served
But once we spoke up (and they figured out what happened with the menus) they re-did the dish in a butter sage sauce, which was awesome
We were appreciative of that
My mushroom/shrimp fettucine (a special) was tasty but I wasn't crazy for the shrimp, which tasted a bit fishy

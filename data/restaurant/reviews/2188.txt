should not be considered a top chinese resteraunt
mr k's and mr
chows are far superior
While visiting in NY over the Thanksgiving Holiday, the concierge at the Waldorf recommended Chin Chin
I was traveling with my teenage daughters and my niece
The restaurant was very accomodating for my niece who is not fond of asian cuisine and served her very plain fried rice!! My daughters and I loved the food and the atmosphere
We'll put it on our list for next year's visit
Most have annoited Shun Lee Palace as the supreme Chinese cuisine spot
So, if you want the next best then try Chin Chin - my personal favorite
Jimmy Chin is a master host and manager
Your wait will be short and pleasant due to the friendly confines of the bar and staff
Your food will be expertly prepared and recommendations are eagerly given
Kudos to Jimmy and the gang
We love Chin Chin
Service was great- waiter was attentive, funny, nice- food was very good too!
Unfortunately we did not enjoy our experience
The service and decor were incredible, but I can not say the same for the food
I have had better at our local Canton
The food was bland and not what we expected
Avoid this restaurant unless you want to pay too much for what is known as American Chinese food
A typical restaurant like this which is geared towards underexperienced tastebuds should run you no more than $5-10 per plate because the ingredients for many of their dishes are cheap, cheap, cheap
I suggest Ivy's Cafe as an alternative (a hole, but it catered for the President of China when he visited)
Finally, a restaurant for *pallid* palates in search of stir-fry in a civilized atmosphere (e
g
, no Chinese clientele or greasy chopsticks in sight)
Sorry, but pressed linens, coattailed staff, and fancy names for disgusting chicken drenched in soy do not sophisticated cuisine make
I, for one, will never again grumble about platters of Mystery-Meat Chowmein in zero-atmosphere Chinatown
At least I know I'm not just kidding myself about dining on Chinese
In Short Enter through the corporate lobby, follow a small gold sign that points down an industrial stairwell and you'll happen upon a subterranean sake lounge with a highly loyal following
American jazz is the music of choice, but the decor is pure Japanese minimal, all bamboo plants and paper lanterns
There's an extensive sake menu and the dinner menu offers sashimi (no sushi), as well as a range of less familiar Japanese dishes
We love this place and are now regulars
Never have the same sake twice, try the chicken meatballs, blackened cod, and riceballs
If you are more daring, there are a vast number of dishes with squid, octopus, and other creatures with many legs
There is something for everyone here
Even if you don't think you love Japanese, you will find something delicious on their menu
Service varies depending on whose section your seated in, but the atmosphere is unique and soothing, the food is always excellent, and we always have a wonderful time here
Plus, if they ever make a mistake or if it's a holiday, they usually throw in a little dessert sake on the house
This is one of our favorite places in New York
Great expectations and was not disappointed; truly one of the city's best secrets
The food was amazing, with the specials menu shining
Excellent service, waiter brought complimentary tastes of different sakes when challenged for something unusual and the food arrived promptly as we finished each set of dishes
This isn't a place to go for a quick bite, but rather a pleasantly paced evening - we spent 2
5 hrs
Dishes are small at ~$10 each, and sake can get expensive
The food was good, the sake was great, but the service was BAD
It takes us 2 1/2 hour before we can have our main dish, all the dishes was serve one after another and we were so hungry
It wasn't that busy, its a week night
suggestion, eat some thing before you go or else you will be starving to death
Really a memorable evening! Went as a group of four and split several dishes, each one topped the next! Beautiful evening, great dishes which for me were very experiemental as I'm not very accquainted with true Japanese cuisine, however I sat along some some old pros who found each bite just as inviting! Plus the sake menu is very descriptive and helpful as are the servers! For a couple hours we were convinced we stepped out of New York and into Japan!
If you are from Japan or have been to Japan you would know what I'm talking about
5 of the dishes my friend I shared were not Americanized in anyway
More importantly a lot of the diners were either Japanese or Americans who came with their Japanese friends
That says a lot about Sakagura's authenticity
DO NOT skip the desserts! Mark my words
Desserts for 2 is a really good deal
They're desserts are same as the ones from Cha-an near St
Marks and that place is really famous for its delish desserts
Though desserts are more fusion, I honestly don't think people would truely appreciate authentic Japanese desserts and thus think that carrying fusionized desserts is a good idea
Not your average sushi joint
They have specials that you won't find on the menus of most Japanese restaurants
Been there twice, and I've learned to try at least two kinds of sake when I'm there
I definitely recommend getting a hot sake and a cold one
It's hard to find (great way to act like a hot shot on a first date) and the decor is awesome (dark but you can still see everything)
Side note: they have one of those futuristic toilets from Japan
Be careful what buttons you press
Sakagura is an very unusual place
I cannot state with certainty that it is authentic, but it certainly is unlike any other Japanese restaurant in New York
The atmosphere is warm and cozy
The bartenders are very friendly
We asked for help picking out Sake, and the bartender gave us a free tasting
Be careful when deciding on a bottle Sake as some are very expensive
The food is very good, but the portions are tapas-sized
The veal tongue is outstanding as is the cod
The duck, filet mignon, monkfish liver are also quite good
The tea is nothing special, but people don't come here for tea
When making a reservation, if you don't specify that you want a table, you may be seated at the bar
However, eating at the bar here is a pleasant experience
The prices can get high, as the portions are small
very unnoticeable entrance, hidden and beautiful decor
small appetizer portions but large variety of appetizer dishes and good special entrees
desserts very good
buying the chocolate truffles came in nice packaging
Went here for the first time last week and had a fabulous time
The portion size / price combo makes it expensive if you're really hungry, but we went for a late dinner
This is perfect place if you basically want to nibble some delicious treats while taking full advantage of the sake options
I will be going back
The tuna tartare was my favorite dish of the night
Oh, and the chocolate souffle was definitely the best dessert (we tried almost all of them)
Too bad I'm not a drinker because that seems to be the best part of Sakagura
As my friends enjoyed the delicious sake from the blue bottle, I pondered over the so-so food
Although the eggplant 3 miso dish was not bad, I've had better at Taste of Tokyo
The age-tofu (deepfried) was not cooked all the way through
The baked fish smelled fishy(in a bad way), cold spinach with sesame was okay and so was the cubed steak with dikon oroshi
The food was just
okay
For dessert, I had the black sesame creme brulee topped with black sesame ice cream
Friends had coffee jelly w/ice cream, green tea truffles, chocolate souffle, and one ice cream dish that tasted like royal milk tea (this was the unanimous favorite)
Yummm!!! I suggest eating somewhere else and stopping by Sakagura afterwards for the great sake selection and fantastic, creative desserts
This is truly a hidden secret

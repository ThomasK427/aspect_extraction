Also pretty expensive
Doesn't live up to the quality setting it seems to display
People are nowadays looking for an inexpensive food with the yummy taste
We ate at Pam real Thai encore for that reason but very disappointed and ate tasteless Thai food
The Pad Thai was very oily and tasteless
The service was ok but did not look a professional one
We would rather pay more prices and expect the better food and service
This is not perhaps The Pam real thai but the fake Thai
Or may be Thai food really goes down the hill
I am personally suggested that Thai restaurants before named the place like  real thai, please make sure the food is tasty not tasteless
Thank you
I think it's the hip younger sibling of Pam Real Thai
I'd been to Pam Real Thai many times just happened upon Encore the other day while walking home
I was in a hurry, so I ordered some take-out
The decor is hip, fun, the hostess was really nice while I was waiting
(Not the mention the hot guy behind the bar
) I got Fried Tofu and some Spring Rolls
It's probably not a big deal to most, but the fact that there were four rolls instead of the usual three with other places, was a nice (and yummy) surprise
I also liked the fact that the food was kept in heater bags to keep warm
Most places put it in plastic containers which makes it a bit cold by the time I get home
I look forward to going back when I'm not in a rush
We have a great expectation about this new coming Thai place but very dissatisfy
The foods were too dried and too salty
And we don't understand why they use japanese waitress to serve Thai food
They had seemingly not acknowledged Thai dishes well on the menu
It is also too much of using MSG in the food
We had to drink a lot of water
A great cozy little restaurant with warm staff and wonderful food
Pork dumplings were lovely and delicate but with a flavor that really popped
Crab cakes are particularly amazing, meaty and nicely contrasted with chili aioli and endive/radish sprouts
Ravioli with mushrooms, arugala, and pine nuts was perfect
And then there's Steve's Key Lime Pie
Go now and make it an outing
Check out the lovely Red Hook Waterfront, some local arts, maybe a bar and this great little restaurant
But after spending most of May inside I decided to give Imagine a try
The menu is very similar and the chef was the same so the food was equally as good as Miracles
The service was exceptional though
The staff is extremely friendly and efficient
I was told that the owners are on hand at all times and I met one on the way out and was asked how everything was and thanked for coming in
They have a good drink menu and I had passion fruit margaritas that were wonderful
All in all a great time was had by every one in my party
It was a beautiful night and I think it's one of the best restaurant gardens I've been to in the whole city
My mom was in town and the waiter was so personable that my mom said she didn't realize there were such nice people in the East Village
It was perfect
I had this great pork chop
Huge and delicious
And we shared some scallops for an appetizer that were amazing
Really
Get the scallops
Just try this delightful restaurant and you will often go back
The chef is great and the food sells itself
The duck is exquisite but everything on the menu is so good that you will be happy with any choice
Ive personally tried almost everything on the menu and been amazed at the quality and presentation
Add to that the pleasant helpful staff and reasonable prices and you wont be disappointed
Did I mention the beautiful garden!
My boyfriend and I loved Imagine Bar and Grill
The scallop appetizer was delicious and the duck was the best I've ever eaten
The blood orange sangria and margaritas were great
The service was friendly and attentive
The prices are very resonable
All this plus
we sat in the most beautiful private garden in the East Village
We are definetly going back!!!
Imagine has become my Sunday morning brunch regular spot
The garden is just about the niciest you will find anywhere in the area
So far I've tried the pancakes and the breakfast burrito and both were great
But you'd better have a big appetite if you order the burrito, it's huge
The service, on most occasions, was adequate
They are attentive when necessary but leave you alone if you're into the Times! As I said, I'm a regular, so I'll be going back and recommending others to try it, too
They kept the chef, margarita machines, and practically the identical menu from Miracle Grill (the restaurant that formerly had the space); how is it that everything here is so much worse? I saw the bartender making margaritas with Puckr, and though I will admit that Miracle's food was sub-par, they kept the margaritas strong enough that you never cared
Not so at Imagine-- weak and too sweet, which made me all the more aware of how terrible the food was
In addition, the servers ignored us and kept forgetting things we asked for
The garden is BEAUTIFUL, but I'm never going back
(As a side note, a friend saw the owner going into Imagine with a bag full of McDonalds food
Should we take it as a bad sign that even the owner prefers fast food over his own restaurant?)
The new ownership looks like newbies at running a restaurant
There was a shortage of wait staff and bar staff
The place wasn't full but they really had no idea of what they were doing
It seems like all the waiters and bartenders all called in sick
20 minutes to take our order
15 more minutes to get our drink order, which they should have taken with our order before running away
The food came out and was decent, but I've had much better meals when Imagine was called Miracle Grill We spoke to own of the owners who seemed like a nice person but not an experienced restaurant manager
We were not offered a discount for our troubles
I love the outdoor space and that's the draw for eating there, but there are plenty of other places that have outdoor seating and have a clue
Good ambience and friendly staff
The decor is good and the place is spacious
The seats by the windows are the best
The food was not the best Indian/fusion that I have ever had
The takeouts that I ordered before tasted a lot better than the food I had when I was there
Also, the portions are relatively small
All said, the food/ambience/staff/presentation just does not justify the price premium that they charge
You can have a great experience in any of the other Indian restaurants on the same street without having to shell out as much
Overall not bad
rap was that it went through an overhaul due to some difficulties
came back with a fresh paint
now it has good steam in the engine but needs a lot of coal to work it
Would be a even better experiance if it was lighter on the wallet
This is a top-notch Indian food restaurant
Me and my guests LOVED it!! The seafood and poultry was very fresh
And the staff are all so nice and give excellent recommendations

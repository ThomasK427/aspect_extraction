Then this is the place for you
We left before honesty was completely hung out to dry
Although seeming like a trendy little restaurant, when it comes to the food and ambiance I'd say it leaves a lot to be desired
The dishes we ordered were verging on bland (notable exception being the spicy yucca fritters), and barely like authentic vietnamese (my wife is vietnamese and she wasn't impressed)
The place was so crowded getting out felt like being in a rush-hour subway
The noise level was almost intolerable, making any type of conversation difficult, let alone intimate conversation
I don't think I'll go back
Although the setting may be a bit tight, Bao 111 is still more cozy than cramped
The service is great, with a polite staff who do a great job of going out of their way for clientele
Our appetizers were offered for free after being only slitely late to the table
The menu contains a large variety of unique options, ranging from the modern Vitenamese to a number of fusion dishes
All in all, a very enjoyable restaurant in a unique part of town
I'm Vietnamese and have lived in S
Cali for over 20 years
Since in NYC for the past 5 years, I've been searching for a decent Viet
meal, and have not found the spot to return to
When my boyfriend mentioned Bao, I was cynical
We made the trek over to Ave C last night, and all I could think about was: It better be good
And it was
I liked the feel of the place: cool, soothing, and clean
The service was excellent
We ordered the full 3-course meal, and everything was delicious
The chicken with quail eggs was much better than my mom's (need more quail eggs though), and the yucca cake with jasmine ice cream was yummy (need more ice cream)
The only con: the price
a bit too expensive
My suggestion: drop the price or increase the portion, esp
on the prawn dish
Exceptional Vietnamese food from beginning to end! Great ambiance too
Love this place
The only drawback -- a bit out of the way (Ave
C) but completely worth the trip
Hot infused sake a must
No better shrimp toast anywhere
Crab soup very good
Filet minion dish wonderful; iron pot chicken delicious, quail eggs huge plus, but wished the chicken didn't have the skin on as it wasn't a crispy skin dish
Hip, warm ambiance, suits at the bar, jeans next to us, and a large table of boys with that studied I haven't brushed my hair in 5 days look across the way
In the restroom, ambient lighting, scattered pebbles and rose petals, and Kiehl's soap lotion at the sink
Nice touch, guys
The service was tremendous, and the food very tasty
A great selection of dishes, all delicious
Also cool, happening vibe
Not bad for a neuveau Vietnamese restaurant
The food is pretty good and they don't go overboard with the whole fusion thing
The service is sort of clueless though and wine is served in a water glass which is rather tacky
Comfy seats and nice music
Just a little overpriced but overall worth a visit
The food was excellant , are group tried several appetizers , entrees and desserts
The entire staff was friendly and made sure we were satisfied with everything
The food flavoring was truly unique!! Nice dimly lit setting with great artwork
Why is it that no reviewers have mentioned anything about the wonderfully warm and wonderful Yam soup, especially tasty during these cold winter days
I've been there twice in a week, this says a lot because I live on the upper eastside and alphabet city is a little far south
The service is good but the food portions are way way way too small for the price they charge
If you want good Vietnamese food, I suggest going to somewhere authentic (chinatown)
I thought it would be good but the food is just another fusion wanna be Viet food
Very disappointing after reading rave reviews about it
Do not be fooled
do not go there
and I am serious
Nice atmosphere, comfy pillows and nice lighting
The food a bit on the salty side but is fixable with a nice bowl of white rice
Vietmanese food with a little twist
A little pricey but still worth a try
Only dissappointment is that they serve wine but no wine glasses?! big minus there, but the chef gave us 2 free deserts so i fogot about the glasses after that
Must try the ice cream, but warning!! STAY AWAY from the JASMINE ice cream! all the others are good though
Hands down, a great place start to finish for the stylin'hip-foodie types
The friendly and attentive staff compliment the relaxed/intimate decor beautifully (a great date place)
The food
w-o-w
The appetizers and the desserts (we had a group I got to try them all!) are the high points
Asian inspired ice creams (jasmine, green tea, black sesame, etc) are REALLY refreshing and other desserts equally delectable
Entrees lean towards traditional succulent Viet-fare-with-a-flair and are wonderfully executed
Take all your friends
they'll be impressed
Please go and check out this out of the way fusion Vietnamese in East Village
Great food with both traditional and inventive takes on Vientnamese cuisine and a nice setting make it worth a trip to this Ave C standout
Gary, the Sunday Maitre d' is as entertaining as any I have every come across, period end of discussion
I had a 2nd date here and it could not have been better although the jasmine ice cream is a touch overpowering
I generally drink only cold sake but hot clementine infused sake is a must (especially on cold Winter days)
Order freely but ask as to all ingredients as some may be left out (cilantro was everywhere and my date can't tolerate it - I love it though!)
Highly recommend this spot
It will soon become a small restaurant of note especially with Chris Johnson (of Bond St
sushi and Thom @ 60 Thompson fame) behind the helm
Overall, it's a great place to hang out with friends
It's a very warm and inviting place
The food was superb especially the iron pot chicken! The dessert really puts a great finish to an outstanding meal
It's a great twist to SE Asian cooking!
While staying at the Ritz on business I've eaten about five meals at this restaurant
Some things were good, and others were not
I found the steak to be too rare
The tuna was extremely spicy, which was not mentioned on the menu
The lobster bisque, on the other hand, was very good
Some of the other dishes were good as well
The sauce chef was a nice touch
The staff is generally courteous and attentive
The atmosphere is quiet and pleasant
The bottom line is that when I don't have time to go elsewhere and am on an expense account, I would visit this place
However, this is not a place I'd visit for dinner when I am paying
For the same price, you can go to a much better restaraunt
2 West at the downtown Ritz location is quite the dining experience
The house specialty is the lobster bisque and the menu includes a porterhouse for two (great) and a Hawaiian Kobe (even better)

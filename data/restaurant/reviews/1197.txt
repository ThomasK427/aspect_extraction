Went in here on Valnetines Day
I just prayed that it be really good as my gf falls for Thai food and I had picked this restaurant based on review here
I wasn't disappointed! It has a lovely, trendy, modern setting with just the right amount of backlight
Candle on the table just enough to read the menu
They have traditional (read cliched) pad thai, etc, as well as some very interesting stuff
We became adventerous and tried two totally new items (for us) - a Roadside Fried Rice and the Thai Stick (see their menu)
The food was superb, particularly, the side sauce (kind of salsa with mangoes and onions in a tangy, sweet, spicy syrup
We ended with a lovely dessert -[diffcult name] - steamed banana with sticky rice served with coconut ice-cream
Don't miss this! The portion sizes are moderate
We spent about $45 (including tips) for two
I would recommend making reservations for this place, as it always seems to be crowded
My friends and I went at 9:30pm on a Tuesday night and we waited for about 20min
The restaurant has a modern feel to it, but the food is nothing short of amazing
I am definitely coming back here!
Walking down St
Marks, you would never think this place would be there, but in the end it fits in nicely
Let me say this
I'm not a huge Thai fan, but I AM a huge Klong fan
The waiter was very friendly and answered all our questions (wifey usually has a few)
For app, we had the Tuna Tartar on tortilla which was very interesting and a little fishy
She had a spicey rice dish and I had the Singha pork chop which was quite tender and tasty
After drinks we walked out of there for under $50!! Definitely a great value for the money
Try the Phuket After Rain drink!
Wow!!!!  What a great find ( we passed by it 2x before we saw the front door)
The food was fabulous
The wait staff was warm and charming and very helpful
My brother has been there a few times and he has loved every dish that he has ordered
The tamarind martini is yummy
I'm hooked
This was my 1st time trying THAI food! and I love it NOW~! This is a great place for a romantic date, or out with a bunch of friends
Make sure your make reservations, cus they are busy on the weekends! Def, Def try the green papaya salad for an appetizer
Overall very good food and service! :) would def like to try this place again
My friend told me about this restaurant and said it was great
I tried it out and ended up loving everything about it
The food was superb, drinks were great, service was wonderful and atmosphere was very beautiful
The statues and water running through was very amazing
The price is cheap and well worth it
I told all my friends about this place and we go there a lot now
I recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal and a way cheap price

I was appalled by the service I received at Klong
I was looking for a quick lunch, but ended up being at the restaurant for over one hour
Before we even got our appetizers, they served appetizers and lunches to 4 tables that were seated 10 minutes AFTER we ordered
Their excuse was that they misplaced our ticket
Once we finally got our appetizers (which was 40 minutes after we ordered), the soup was cold
They handled the situation very poorly and did not offer take anything off the bill
I will never go back and I suggest you never go
I visited Klong last week, and it was an extraordinary experience
The food was delightful
The cocktails were amazing
Servers were very attentive - plus very attractive! I was surprised when i received the bill - Ater several appitizers, entrees, and countless delicious cocktails it was 18
00 each (between 4 of us)
I definitely recommend this place
I absolutely love this place
The drinks are good
My friends and I always go whenever we are in St
Marks
They can accomodate large groups or just two people
The restaurant itself isn't very large, however
The food is incredible though and for really low prices
I would recommend this place if you're on a budget and still want to eat out
The service is good, the waitors are kind
We have never had a rude waitor
Hands down, the best thai food that I've had in NYC so far -- The basil noodles, in particular, were wonderful
My only complaint was that the house red wine was some mixture that I could barely drink
The cocktails, though, were wonderful
My friend and I stopped by here the other night because it looked like a cool place
I am so happy we did
We got so much food and drinks fro a great price
Dinner and drinks for two for $40 is quite reasonable
Esp
in NYC
Everything we had was delicious, will be back soon cant wait to try more
Very quick and attentive service
we first went to Klong a week after it opened and enjoyed the thai food and had no complaints on the service so much we decided to revisit with friends a month later
the queue was very long so we were glad we had made a reservation
however the staff were very rude this time around and rushed us through dinner, serving us the bill along with the dessert and grabbing the dessert plates as soon we put our forks down
the eagerness to 'turn tables' really upset us and detracted from the experience
however the thai food is clearly one of the best in the city and very good value for money, would recommend the green curry puffs and calamari for starters
I had made rsvps for a big group of ppl
A MONTH in advance but the owner of the restaurant gave me so much grief about everything that I ended up canceling TWO DAYS before the party
1
They won't seat you unless EVERYONE in your group is there; 2
Only a 15-min window is given from the time of rsvp, after that they'll give your reserved seats away; 3
Once you are seated they expect you to order food within 5-10 min or theyll ask you to leave; 4
They NEVER told me about a $20 minimum per person and a 2 hour limit until 2 days before my party; 5
The owner continually screamed and talked over me
Hes VERY rude! I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone if customers are treated like dirt as I was treated by the OWNER himself
A restaurant catered to its owner not the customers
i was here a few weeks ago with a large group
even though we were a little bit late for our reservation the staff was graicous and accomodating
The food was good, the drinks are great, and the service was wonderful
I was impressed with how well they handled our group of 10,lots of places might rush you out but not here
highly recommended!

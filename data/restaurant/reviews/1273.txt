The entrees - bad
The brisket was just OK and everything else was dry and sauce-less
Spanky's two stars, though: the cornbread and the mashed potatoes
Both were divine
CAUTION: The gravy - It is the worst tasting gravy ever
Unfortunately, Spanky's did not satisfy the barbecue craving
I am still on the look-out!
I had the craving for some good BBQ and decided to go to try out Spankys
When I got there, who I guessed was the manager was standing at the host stand and told us to wait until the hostess got back
He proceeded to just sit there while I stood waiting
That was so weird that he would not help out
This was just the beginning of my confusion
During my whole meal, there seemed to be chaos around the restaurant with the staff and management
My waiter got interrupted three times from serving by who I guess were other managers talking about hot sauces and whatnot
The food was fine and the server was great, I just felt like I was the lowest priority there in the eyes of the establishment
Service was terrible
We waited 30 minutes for our main dishes, and our appetizer never appeared
The young waitress could at least have been gracious or proactive about the problems, but simply angrily blamed everything on the kitchen
And the food was HORRIBLE: My brisket was fatty, tough, and tasteless -- the worst I've ever had -- and the BBQ sauce generic
The tater tots on the menu were actually potato croquettes and not very good
My friend's short ribs had a great rub with some heat, but were so tough he had to ask for a steak knife
Again, the worst BBQd ribs we've ever had
And PLEASE: in places like this where people often eat some of the food with their hands, you need to wipe down the BBQ bottles (salt shakers, etc
) along with tabletops
Our BBQ bottle was dirty and sticky and disgusting
I applaud the chef- the chili is orgasmic, the wings, the ribs are all heavenly
Friendly staff, friendly atmosphere, great tap beer, and EXCELLENT food
Nuff said
I recently dined at the new Spanky's BBq in times square
It by far exceeded my expectations
The jerk chiicken wings were terrific
I even tried their Challenge Menu which featured hell fire ribs
I'm a big fan of hot and spicy food
These ribs were so hot you think it was made by the devil himself
The BBQ chicken was flavorful
They even had my favoraite Heartland Beer, Indian River Light, on tap
The servce was great and the atmosphere even greater
I can't wait to dine there again
I went here on a weeknight when it wasn't crowded
Mentioned to the server when ordering that we didn't want our main courses right away
The appetizers came, fried pickles and onion straws, both very good and great dips too
TWO minutes later my bbq platter came out
I had to fight with the busboy to get it sent back and he returned four minutes later while we were still eating appetizers
So we wound up eating it cold
The chicken was extremely spicy and the brisket, ribs and pork are all VERY dry
I didn't like the coleslaw, it is vinegar and mustard based
One of the worst I've ever tasted
Corn was fine
The chicken wings here are AWESOME! They're smoked - not fried
They have a really good dry rub on them and they serve it with a pineapple-jerk seasoning salsa
I normally wouldn't write a review but this place honestly deserves to be noted for a seemingly different but very delicious take on normal bar food
The house-brewed beer goes excellent with them
Went here for the ribs, which unfortunately, were only average
The best thing about the dinner was the cole slaw and the Chocolate Cream Pie
But everything else about the place was so good that we will go back
The decor is great, and the service is outstanding
This place is new so we will try it again
This is a micro-brewery
Ambience is upscale pub
The beer is good but the food is not great
If you want real BBQ go somewhere else
Gioia is what the village used to be known for: fresh ingredients, carefully prepared, good wine--all at a bargain
It feels like a family business, cozy and welcoming; yet the thin crust pizza is anything but casual, ranking among the city's best
The small list of appetizers and entrees are almost as stellar, many prepared in the wood-burning oven
Even wine mavens will be pleased with the quality and economy of the wine list
What a great addition to my neighborhood and they deliver, magically keeping the crust crisp en route!
I was so happy to see this cute place open up in my neighborhood
What a disappointment - the service was AWFUL we waited almost 30 minutes to get our order while I sat and listened to phone orders coming and going
I suggest they feed the people setting in the restaurant first
Once we got our pizza which was supposed to be 3 mushroom it had maybe a total of 12 mushrooms total and they were all the same kind
I will not go again you can get much better pizza and service else where/anywhere
This is a great new restaurant
The food is excellent and simple, while the prices are very reasonable (especially for the area)
The ambiance is also very nice and the giant wood burning oven makes a nice statement of old world quality
The only thing missing is that they're not open for lunch
this pizza is an art
an unbelievable pizza
simple subtle flavors of cheese dough and tomato make absolute harmony together
everything on the menu is great
try the calzone
oh
the nutella dessert will be a classic
chocolate hazelnut spread and pizza dough
OH MY GOD
federico from la cantina is part of this group
he is on the rise to restaurant stardom
its still new, and they say the oven only gets better with time (to cure) we are so haPPY that the west villiage has this much needed restaurant
they sat us in the back room with our own waiter
great fun for gruops
after a much need boost to 8th ave comes along this fantastic wood burning pizzeria restaurant
the food is amazing
the pizzas are as authentic as you can find anywhere in italy
wonderful wine list by the glass or bottle
also great salads pastas and grilled meats
pasta cooked in terracotta bowls are amazing
go for the lasagna
everthing cooked in the oven
also a large back room for private functions is a great addition
Gyu-Kaku has been one of the most famous Japanese BBQ restuarants in NYC for a while now and across the world (popular Japanese chain), with the food deceptively looking like Korean BBQ (kimchi included) but with significantly less portions and high prices
Like any Asian BBQ restaurant, group dining makes this one of the best experiences and the service is decent as well -- they even include a How did I do? card for the end of their meal

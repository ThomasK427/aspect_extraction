The portions are small, which is great because you can try more things!
Me and my boyfriend were in town from SF and I'm originally from Vancouver, so Japanese food/izakaya is no stranger to us
We ordered the signature tasting menu and it was very tasty
We got 9 dishes in total for $100 for 2
The sashimi were very fresh
The pork belly and beef dish were average
The yuba is better than the tofu
The halibut was not as good as the shrimp fritters, but the black cod was awesome
I think my favorite was still the ice-cream
It was the smoothest ice-cream I've had and the flavour (fig) was very unique
I think it was a great value for all the food we had and I highly recommend the tasting menu if you are only visiting and want to try everything
I must agree with the reviewer below in that the portions are small
So much so, that the average diner would be left wanting
I have to disagree, though, and say the dishes are indeed palatable and were served promptly, although the rice dishes will take up to 40 minutes, which is indicated on the menu
The decor was pleasant and charming, and the dinner presentations certainly complemented
On the other hand, the prices did not
There are places around the neighborhood with much better fare for the buck, and unfortunately, the dishes themselves were too reserved for their own good, and the diner's
Come here for the drinks, come for the ambience, come for the attentiveness of the staff, who in their own right, are excellent
This place is a complete joke
The portions were tiny, the octopus tasted fishy and the sushi platter for $80 had nothing on it
I was completly disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
After paying $370 for dinner for 4 we left the place hungry! What a joke
There are so many other nice places in this city
This is not worth a visit
I love EN
I don't like sitting in the main restaurant, though it is beautiful, much prefer the lounge--it's not a bar, just a cozier dining room
The service is just right--you're not ignored, but you're not pestered by too much attention, either
NOW TO THE GOOD PART: the house salad of mizuna greens and tofu skin is SO tasty, the sake-marinated sea bass is heavenly, the sake selection is the best I've seen in the city--and their sake sommelier Taka sure is cute! The sashimi is on par with Nobu and Bond Street, but at a fraction of the cost--every morsel of fish I ate melted in my mouth
Other favorites are the shrimp fritters, fried chicken (Im from the South, and believe me, its as good as my mamas), and the Berkshire pork belly
Oh! And that cocktail! The Momoyama is a perfect tasty treat for summertime, fruity without the cloying sweetness you usually find in fruity drinks
I highly recommend EN
I made reservations for a group of 6 for a Saturday night dinner
Our table was ready when we arrived
The service was attentive without being bothersome
We all shared some sushi to start which was very good
We all got different main courses from noodle dishes to seafood dishes to tempura
Everyone was very pleased
The room was really nice as well and had a great feel to it
I have learned so much by coming to EN probably because I come weekly
This has one of the strongest selections of authentic Japanese foods in the city because this is the extension of EN in Japan which has revolutionized Izakya (traditional japanese tapas)
I found the service fully attentive and highly knowledgeable about the cuisine, which for food that many of us can be difficult delectables to describe
I was reading the reviews of this restaurant and noticed a single incredibly inaccurate review
The only complaint I'd like to make is that sometimes you have to sit next to people like him/her
--- I only make this comment because I probably come here much more regularly than him/her and find the service prompt and can now consider the host my friend
My girlfriend and I went to EN for a special Valentine's Day dinner
The space was really incredible with tasteful, modern decor
Since it was a busy night we were not able to get seated at the center communal table with the pond as I would have liked
Our seating at the other communal table was a good second choice though
We decided on the chef's signature dish special
The fish we tasted was all very well prepared
The fresh tofu was refreshing and the pork belly was rich and indulgent
Most of these dishes felt like good quality Japanese comfort food, especially the rice dishes
The uni, not part of the chef's signature, was extremely fresh and tasty
Our drinks were strong (thanks bartender-san)
The servers were very nice and attended to our needs, though throughout the dinner I felt that they were a bit too efficient
Just went back for a birthday party and had another great meal
Service has improved too
We had the whole Perch fish in soy and it was amazing
I didn't like something called nama foo, but I think it must be one of those things you have to grow up eating
All in all, this has become one of my favorite restaurants
Highly recommended!
Nobu wantabee, same price with similar style, but the food is not even close
Have to say the service was great, but it was quickly overshadowed by the quality/taste of the food
We ordered 10 selections for 4 people and many were left on the table, even though the portions were small
Ever since a trip to Tokyo 2 years ago, my wife and I obsess over finding authentic Japanese food--and not just sushi
EN has the real-deal izakaya cooked food that you get over there and we were really impressed
The space is big and bustling (a little loud), but the food and whole experience was excellent
We got the tasting menu($100 for two), which was a selection of the signature dishes
It was fantastic and a great value
I would highly recommend this place
This is not a place for couples
If you are a couple, you'll either be seated at an awkward communal table where you're on top of your neighbors, or at kiddie tables in the bar area
The communal table does not extend out far enough such that your legs get very cramped after awhile
I went in for sushi and left with a case of deep vein thrombosis
The hostesses are also a bit snotty about informing you that these are your only seating choices
This in unfortunate, because the food is actually excellent, particularly the tofu dishes
If you have a party of 3 or more, I would highly recommend the place, as you'll be seated at a real table
Not a place to go for couples on a date
Took my boyfriend, a sushi lover, to En for his birthday
We were both happily surprised with the consistency and flavor of the food--the fish was very fresh and the menu accommodating for both fish and non-fish lovers
I went last weekend and had a very delicious meal
The service must have improved bcz the staff were very attentive and friendly and not rude at all (according to previous stingy reviews)
The fresh warm tofu, chu toro, croquette and shrimp fritters were delicious! Sashimi was fresh (the salmon was so smooth and buttery!) We only ordered appetizers, dessert and a sake sampler
It can get pricey with more drinks
I am looking forward to going back next week to try their grilled meat w/ foie gras and their pork shoulder dish! Definitely a place to try! I didn't mind the communal table by the water pond - I'm not a table snob! Great atmostphere!
I was blown away by the atrium-like space
We sat at the beautiful communal table
Food was however only average
The tataki beef was good
The salt-crusted duck meat was not tender at all, and the stuff squid was very dry and hard to swallow
Service was attentive in the beginning, but went downhill as the night got busier
We sat for 20 mins plus before we got the attention of the waitress
I say go for the experience, not the food
The food is very very good, but unfortunately the menu is limited
i do not recommend the tasting menu because it's pretty much the same as ordering a la carte
the last time i was there, we decided to try the sashimi and we LOVED it
the sake list is also reasonably priced, particularly my favorite
the staff is a little rude and hostile, which would normally turn me away from frequenting a restaurant, but the food is so yummy and the sake so accessible, that I find myself coming back for more
Since January, I have been here about 5-6 times!
En has great tasting food that is not only pleasing to the tastebuds but is extremely healthy as well

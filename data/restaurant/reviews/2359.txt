This place defintely stands out for its service among all the Indian restaurants in NY, NJ area
We tried the Tasting menu', and the manager offered to select the items to be served after taking inputs from us ( Choice of meat, allergies etc
)
They have parking nearby (Ikon on 2nd Ave between 58 and 57) and validate the parking for the full price
The fish and chicken kebabs are very good
On the expensive side though
I went to dawat along with a couple of friends to celebrate my promotion
The whole experience was great
The staff was courteous and polite
The food was superb
Try the Baghari Jhinga Appetizer and the Lobster main course
It was a sheer delight
On the whole it was a memorable evening for all of us
Thank you Dawat for a job well done
The food and service is fantastic
The best indian food I have had since I have been in new york
You have to try the mango martinis-yum!
I went there with my husband and it was a terrible experience
The food was mediocre, the service poor, inexperience waiters
The waiter brought the wrong dish to my table and didn't apologize
After I was half way through my dish, then they brought out the rest of the items that came with my meal
They never once came back to the table to ask how we were doing
Don't go here for Indian food, try Tamarind instead
Having read so much about this restaurant as the best Indian in town, i was thoroughly disappointed
The food are mediocre and the service extremely choppy
Tries too hard to be upscale, and falls short and becomes way overvalued at best
We went to Dawat two weeks ago
The food was exquisite and the service was very good as well
The shrimp and chicken dish was awesomely delicous
I highly recommend paying a visit to Dawat
Dawat was very disappointing
The appetizers were average
The entrees:The chicken in the chicken dish was undercooked
We had asked for the Rogan Josh-goat but we got what we think was either lamb/bad goat
The shrimp in the shrimp curry ($5extra eventhough it was on the Restaurant week menu) were either undercooked/bad shrimp (they tasted fishy)
They brought out ricenaan enough for about three people so we ordered extra (there were 6 of us)
The carrot dessert was mediocre
The service was poor
The server kept giving the wrong dish to the wrong person with every course would hastily remove dishes we were not yet done with (which might seem hard to imagine considering that the portions were small and undelectable)
If you want upscale Indian food try Ada (which is 'better' and next door) or save yourself the anguish just go to Tabla--second to none
Dawat is a beautiful restaurant with generally impeccable service (exception in a minute), however the food is no better or worse than your average Indian place, and the prices are astronomical
We went during restaurant week, and even with the special paid $50 per person for vegetarian food! Seriously, you may want to go just to laugh at the prices
$5 for a small bowl of plain Basmati rice with no saffron!!! Also, while we were trying to finish our wine after dinner the manager came up and asked us to please move to the bar- very rude! Apparently we were lingering too long in their fine establishment! Overall, I won't go back- just too expensive
New to Manhattan and having problems finding kickass chicken tikka masala and seekh kabobs
I ordered takeout from this place
So far, this is the best I've had
The seekh kabobs are seasoned well
The chicken tikka masala is very good
The raita is awesome; kind of tangy too
The restaurant was very lively and full for a Wednesday night
I definitely will be back to dine in
Kind of on the expensive side, but what do you expect for midtown??
My parents were visiting from India, so I took them to New York's best rated Indian restaurant
Amongst others, we ordered two completely different dishes, one chicken and one shrimp, from different parts of India, and they arrived with the exact same sauce
There are so many better Indian restaurants than Dawat!
The food and service at Dawat is great
I have had a brief tenure in India and in the short period I was there I fell in love with Indian Cuisine
The food at Dawat is amongst the best I have had
The service staff is polite, gracious and well informed
Over all a great place to savour Indian cuisine
The food is good, but the service is cloying and pushy
The waiters try their hardest to sell you the most expensive option on the menu
In light of the price, you will absolutely be happier somewhere else
Even Chola next door is better
If you are looking for an elegant atmosphere try Tamarind and if you are looking for just really good food in a fun/hip atmosphere, try Mirchi
Don't go here - so overrated!
Food was nothing I expected it to be
Taking a clue from Tamarind and Amma, I thought Dawat would be similar
Nada! Old school and old food and service that would have been tolerable if the food was good
I have been going to Dawat for the past four years
In a city where Indian food is polarized betweeen dives in Littel India and upper price disappointments, Dawat is the consistent and tasteful frontrunner
The waiters are attentive, and will accomodate diet requierements and taste preferences
The food is consistently high quality
I strenuously disagree with the reviewer KASSIM
Dawat is worthy of an initial visit as well as repeated ones
Returning to New York after 2 years, I once again went to Dawat at midtown
This bustling Indian restaurant is still pleasing
The food was marvelous, service was outstanding
Before I leave town, I will not leave without dining at Dawat
Though the food was reasonably good, the decore decent and the ambiance inviting, I would have to state very strongly that this place is over-rated
The value isn't that good for the money, and one of the waiters not only aggressively pushed a wine that I didn't want but also insisted I change my choice to a more expensive wine
This sort of behaviour is not only embarrasing but also insulting
I for one do not plan to go back, there are many other places in Manhattan that have just as good food if not better, at the same prices with much better service
The food was delicious at Dawat
I feel it's one of the better Indian places in Manhattan
However, the prices for these dishes are INSANE, relative to other Indian places! Even though I enjoyed my experience, I don't think I would go back
Last night, I treated my mother to a dinner at Dawat for her birthday
My mother, who loves Indian cusine, said that the dishes at Dawat were probably the best she had tasted
We both agreed that the lamb chops cooked in the tandoor were best we had ever tasted
As for the service, the waiter was very informative about some of the exoctic dishes
Friendly ambiance and ample wine list
Overall, amazing dining experience
My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day and were pretty disappointed
The food was really nice, but not good enough to justify the price or the crummy service
In their defense, they were definitely very busy, but not only did we have to wait an absurdly long time for each course, but they left out two of the items which were supposed to be included with the second course
The final blow was when the waiter brought us the check before we had even finished dessert--never mind that the only reason we were taking a long time to finish the meal was because of the extreme delay in the service of our food
I would have expected much better from a restaurant with Dawat's reputation, even on a busy night
Although dinner for 4 (4 beers, 2 drinks, 3 apps, 4 entrees, 3 coffees and one dessert) hit $220, Id still go back
Real estate in this neck of the woods is no doubt expensive
The food was all excellent save the dessert, Kheer, was very weak

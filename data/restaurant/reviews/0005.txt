Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls are a must and if you are not in the mood to have one of their delicious homemade beers - their Root Beer soda is incredible - they make that too
This place has a classy feel and at the same time it's warm and comfortable
Besides the beer that is the best, they make great mix drinks too - their mixologist makes a mean apple martini!
Grrrreat People Watching! Wonderful outdoor seating and a polite staff
Ten thumbs up
Beers on tap were pretty good and we had a great waiter but the food left much to be desired
We all got burgers (they are huge), but like I said, much was to be desired
This place is much better just for grabbing drinks after work, the food is ho hum
Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones
No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown
So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day

What a great place!! Great Food, Beer, staff was exceptionally helpful, especially the Manager Manny
He was awesome! Even though we had to wait to get seated, he promptly made us feel at home and got us seated fast with a friendly smile, at his packed restuarant
What a great place! Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant
A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer
And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too! Loved it!
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks! (Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!! Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!)Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while
I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED! All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends! Go there once and oh yes
you will go back
you will
This was a great value for our trip to NYC
They sure showed us a good time and had some great eats
Beers were great, and the ladies, let me tell you 'bout them fine New York ladies
whoo! (don't tell my wife)
Heartland is the best place in mid-town to grab a beer after work and meet the cuties that work in the building
I've eaten there on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed with the food or the service
They offer hand crafted beers that will suit anyones tastes and are guaranteed to please
Hands down the best beer in the city
I have been to this restaurant a number of times and the food service are always consistently exceptional
Do not miss this restaurant
Great food, great waitstaff, great atmosphere, and best of all GREAT beer! Like I said, what's not to like?
Do what midtowners do - grab lunch, dinner or a drink at Heartland
Hoppin' afterwork or pre radio city crowd, great bar staff guarantees that you'll enjoy yourself no matter what
Try the wings, their burger when you are ready for it (big burger) and surprisingly enough for a brew pub a delicious pasta in a tomato cream sauce with crumbled italian sausage which is DELICIOUS
Karl the Bar Manager makes yummy special drinks for each season be sure to check out what's on his drink menu when you stop in
You won't be disappointed
I've never gotten a bad dish, the waitstaff is attentive and friendly, and the beer is great
The Scene Waiters--winking Old New York types in black vests and white aprons--count on the same scenario every shift
Invariably, an affectionate couple wanders in, handpicks a table and wonders aloud how it's possible they've never noticed this cafe before
More low profile than nearby options, it's a find for locals who prefer a handful of fresh sunflowers and a view of the garden to the tourist-oriented get-em-in, get-em-out establishments nearby
The Food The charming fireplaces and wooden chairs spell cozy cafe-romantic if you're in love, and comfy if you're not
The menu--so large it almost covers the tiny table--lists dinner, snacks and a rambling wine list, in addition to creamy cappuccino and a selection of international pastries, cakes and gelato
Panini or pizzettes loaded with fresh Italian ingredients such as prosciutto, mozzarella and artichokes make it worth staying for dinner
Great place to come in out of the cold and cozy up next to one of their fireplaces
Great coffee and desert
Great date place! I took a date here for a late dinner
It was a casual atmosphere, although very romantic
This is great for a first or second date
The small restaurant was almost completely illuminated by candle light
We sat at a cozy small round table near the fireplace
Considering the number of people in the restaurant, it was not really that loud so it accomodated conversation very well
Prior to arrival, I called to see if a weeknight reservation was necessary and the staff indicated that it was not necessary
When we arrived, we were seated immediately
The server was outstanding and when the candle burned out at our table, he replaced it within seconds! The food was very good and the cost was reasonable for NYC
I've been coming here on and off for the past five years and I have to say that La Lanterna has never, ever dissapointed me
The food is top notch, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is great
If you' re in New York, you do not want to miss this place
Say what you will, I still think the best feature of this fantastic restaurant are the four working fireplaces
There's nothing nicer on cold winter's night than to get one of their many hot coffees--with alcohol or without-and snuggle up to that special someone next to one of La Lanterna's many fireplaces (did I mention that they have four!)
That's my vote anyway
Just thought i'd throw in my 2 cents: La Lanterna gets y vote for BEST PIZZA IN NY
i've been to italy and this is the real deal
Stumbled unto this little gem early one saturday afternoon and was thoroughly pleased with the wonderful little backyard
It is so hard to find nice outdoor dining in NYC that it's worth a mention
The food and service were quite pleasant also
I highly recommend you get there soon, before it's becomes too well known
I've been coming here for a few years and have always been pleased by the great food, attentive service and super atmosphere
Definitely try their Pizzas and Wines--although their desserts are not-to-shabby either
All in all, a winner
I have been coming to La Lanterna since my days at NYU Law and have never been disappointed
The food and coffee are consistently top-notch and the staff is excellent
And with all their recent additions (a jazz bar, and fabulous garden dining) I find that I visit more now than ever
I heartily endorse this NY Institution!
This is definitely the place to take a date when you want to make a lasting impression
I went there last night and the food was great (we had all three lasagnas), the room was dark and romantic, and the jazz spilling out from the bar made the night a hit! You do not want to miss this not-so-little gem!
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time! THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it
Check this place out! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
I love this place
The ambience is fabulous the food is not excellent but it is a so romantic place, that you spend more time to speak and enjoy the place rather to eat (really), the service as always been excellent, I had one a day a problem with a Calzone, I was not happy, the waiter was arguing but gave me a free glass of wine
The music bar downstair, is becoming a gem when jazz players and guitar fans comes to this place
I just read Mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor
I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)! I lOVE THIS PLACE! Keep up the good work guys!
Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience
Reasonable prices
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date
Try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato
WOW
I've been wanting to take my long-distance boyfriend there for months
We finally made it there for our 1 year anniversary
The service was wonderful
The waiter was very attentive and friendly
The thin crust pizza is the best I've ever had
The atmosphere is nice but I was surprised as to how loud it was with all the talking, especially since no other reviewer mentioned this
Consequently, it wasn't the most romantic

Good sea urchin tempura
Stds like Miso soup and Hijiki salad were very good
After paying $125 for our bill, we ended up having buffalo wings down the block
I think this restaurant is definitely overrated
The ambience is great but the food is just average
I can find much better sushi elsewhere in the city with the same price range
There are no negatives here
The sushi is simply the finest you are going to find in NY
OK, it might be expensive, but it is worth every penny
It is consistently superb
The sushi chefs were masterfully trained by Iso and offer items that you simply don't find elsewhere
Try it - no one is ever disappointed
Koi doesn't look so great from the outside, but on steeping in, you're greeted by dim lighting and warm wood
There's not a lot of space to sit (get there EARLY!!!) The waitstaff was very knowledgable about the menu, what was good, and accomodated to our tastes wonderfully
I recommend the blue fin tuna steak, which was a large raw tuna steak that we scooped the flesh out of (= 30 pieces medium sashimi) and the exotic striped bass with a cold water wash and sauce (Sui Gyoza?)
The shrimp shumai were good and the Omakase sashimi platter was a treat to see as well as taste! Beware! it is easy to overspend
Best plan is to order more appetizers and get one sushi platter
The food is expensive, but quality over quantity!
the sushi at koi was, indeed, very fresh and tasty, but this joint offers up nothing special
the menu choices were run-of-the-mill, decor was bland (the photo in this listing makes it look much better than it is), and it felt more like a chain restaurant than an east village gem
i'd have to recommend hasaki as a place with more style and creativity, avenue a for more fun, or takahachi for a classic, awesome east village sushi experience instead
Don't expect delivery before 4:00 because there is none
A friend and I ordered and picked up a Ceviche Mixto, Tallarin Primavera, and a Risotto with beans
The Ceviche Mixto was disgusting
It was mostly huge, unchopped, sloppy strips of fish with a fatty texture
There were 2 measley shrimp, 1 mussel, 1 clam a few shreds of octopus and too many calamari
We couldn't finish this bucket of slop between the 2 of us
The risotto and beans dish was $10, and included some broccoli
Rice and beans with a couple pieces of vegetable is not really a meal
My Tallarin Primavera was basically regular spaghetti with tomato sauce
It seemed very non-Peruvian, in fact, and tasted more like Ragu
Nope, wouldn't get any food here again
Everything about this place is worth checking out
The food is amazing, the people are as sweet as can be and the sangria is top notch
You cant beat the deal you get on the whole chicken with rice and beans
It's cheap, its enough for at least 2 and its damn tasty
So a friend of mine were walking around the East Village trying to find a place to have brunch that wasnt packed we stumbled upon Macora
and to be honest, the cheap price of $8
95 lured us in
I guess we should have realized this place wasn't that great when it was completely empty
We both ordered poached eggs and it is rather hard to get that wrong but they managed to do so
The eggs were completely hard and the hollandaise sauce was thick and disgusting
Bottom line: The food was awful and the service mediocre
Service was excellent and attentive
went for brunch
Great choices for 8
95, including mimosa/sangria (great) / bloody marie
Just stumbled on the place
try the fried bannas w/ purple rice! Amazing! Will go back for dinner!
A friend of mine recommended this restaurant to me and I'm so glad I went
I went with a group of 12 people and everyone enjoyed it
The ambiance is nice - dark wood tables, low light, the smell of fresh spices coming from the kitchen
The waitstaff was super friendly
There a a lot of yummy choices on the menu - something for everyone - it was difficult to make a selection
Some of the things we had that were great were - the roast chicken, the argentinian steak, the snapper and the ceviche
They give good-size portions and the cost is very reasonable
Also had a great list of cocktails
I'm looking forward to going back and trying more dishes
The prices here are very reasonible for peruvian food
There aren't many places like this in the city
Sangria was very strong and the seafood plates are topped with all types of shell fish
They do an excellent job presenting the food
Pitcher of sangria, app, 2 entrees, 2 beers 60 bucks
that's pretty good
Excellent Peruvian!!! If you are not familiar with Peruvian food, this a good a primer - great meat dishes, ceviche, fish
Full bar w/ good mojitos, caipirinhas, etc
Service is very gracious, nice room, excellent food at a good price - quintessential East Village experience!
We have had pretty good food at Bodegas, although their menu is limited (especially if you're vegetarian you'll have a hard time finding too many choices at dinner)
The cooks are willing to accomodate though
The only problem is that if you differ at all from the menu, and sometimes if you don't, you may not get what you asked for
The servers don't tend to be very detail oriented, or seem to care whether or not you get what you ordered
And, if you go for breakfast or lunch, expect rather indifferent service
I've had such great experiences here with the food, the wait staff and music
I think what sets it off is the look of the restaurant itself, the music and the friendly people that usually go there
They have theme nights- Friday is the Flamenco dancers, Sunday and a couple other day's there's a DJ and Wednesday is Mojito night
The DJ's play stuff that is just chill and obscure
Its a good place to bring a date because its really classy with candles lit at night
The food is delicious, I've only been there for dinner and ordered salmon which was awesome and this African Cous Cous salad which was really good
I'm not sure how you would categorize the food, I guess its like a latin fusion
I've never been there for brunch but I hear its good
In Short An assembly line of staffers in this slender, well-lit storefront keep the cream puffs rolling into eager customers' hands
The puffs are made with two layers: The first is choux pastry, which is the pastry that's used in eclairs and profiteroles; the second layer is pie pastry
The puffs are filled to order with a whipped cream-custard mixture
The puffs are best when eaten straightaway, but they can be refrigerated and eaten later
Bite down on the crisp outer shell and cool, sweet, rich, buttery vanilla cream spurts into your mouth and as it travels down your throat, its hard not to close your eyes and say mmm mmm good! Try the chocolate eclair - it's an outrageous treat for the tastebuds as well and at that price, it's a steal!
The freshly baked puff pastry with rich cream inside is just perfect
The cream is just sweet enough
Along with the normal flavor, I highly recommend trying the green tea flavor as well as chocolate
Much more satisfying than your average donut
They are little clouds of heaven
I served them at a dinner party
and wow, did they go
Even the green tea ones
Deceivingly light and fluffy
Despite the somewhat off-putting aroma about this place, the cream puffs are GREAT! Very, very tasty food and you're certainly not going to break the bank here
The regular cream puff was delicious, the eclair, while nice, isn't quite as fresh
I didn't try the flavor of the day, I'll save that for next time
Very nice service, too
The smell of butter permeates this place, but fortunately the cream puffs aren't overly greasy
Their cream puffs are different from ones I've had before; I'm used to chewy choux and egg-custard filling

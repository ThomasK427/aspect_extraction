Owners and managers are very obliging and care about you
You must go to the roof, for a pre dinner cocktail
(Rare View) I love Rare and my compliments for a great neighborhood watering hole Keep up the good work
I'm a happy and content come on back patron
This was by far one of the best meals I've had in NYC
As a frequent visitor, because of business, I am continually looking for an affordable, yet comfortable restraunt/bar in the city
The best turkey burger I've ever had was at Rare and I would highly recommend the sweet potato fries
Not only was the beer cold, the service great and the food out of this world - but the atmosphere is casual, yet sophisticated
This will be a spot I frequent
The burgers at Rare are great as well as the basket of mixed fries
However, the service could use improvement
I didn't enjoy waiting half an hour for the fries as an appetizer and I surely did not appreciate being rushed out of the restaurant and then asked to leave the moment the restaurant picked up
That was pretty rude considering we spent lots of $$$ of beers and food
If you like burgers, eat here, but eat fast!
A great, convenient neighborhood spot for a lite bite and a beer!
Given the high prices, I'd expect much better
My boyfriend and I went early on a Tuesday night and asked to sit at a 3 person booth
The restaurant was empty, yet we were told they were expecting a rush and only parties of 3 could sit there
Twenty minutes later they seated another couple there, and when we left much later the so called rush had never come
As for our waitress, she only had 3 tables to watch, yet did an excellent job of ignoring all of them
We spent half the meal waiting for a side of onion rings that finally came after our entrees were finished
The food was pretty good, but I will never go back as they treat their fictional customers much better than their actual ones
This place needs a reality check or else it certainly won't last
I might not eat meat but I can proudly say the best veggie burger in NYC is at Rare! And if I were to eat meat again, I would have a burger from Rare
My friend who ordered a burger, never put it down on the plate! The beer selection rocks too!
Rare is one of the rarest things: Affordable food in a neighborhood not known for affordable options
The service here is great and the decor is cozy
They have interesting sides like the frickle (fried pickles) and a fried fry sampler featuring 3 types of fries and sauces
After eating at just about every burger place in New York it has become apparent that Rare Bar Grill blows the other burger joints away
A sexy atmosphere with great service will make this my new home
RARE is more of a small sports/hotel bar with a dimly lit dining area
I was expecting a trendy or upscale restaurant after reading reviews in CitySearch TONY
The $21 All American Protein Meal is acclaimed - a Kobe beef patty w/ mushrooms and garlic sauted spinach on the side
I thought the meat was perfect, but that was it
The spinach, side of fries, and house salad were all disappointing
However, I will try it again b/c I am such a meat lover
Man, the guy who posted before me can't spell to save his life
But anyway, I had a good experience at Rare
The burger, to my taste, was quite good, and was helped by the excellent roll on which it was served (I think the menu said the rolls are from Eli's)
I probably wouldn't do the roquefort-stuffed again--it was a little too rich for my blood--but the burger itself was perfectly cooked
Atmosphere was cool too--no complaints at all about that
Burgers were under $10 (at least the non-fancy ones were), so why all the griping on here about price? My personal fav for burgers is still Wollensky's Grill, but Rare can hold its own
Only complaint: Sweet potato fries were bland and greasy
WEnt for a nice lunch with a friend
The waitress was really nice and helpful
The burgers were really good especially the salmon burger
Mouth watering
Nice burger joint
I LOVE rare so much I'm actually afraid to post anything because I don't want too many people to know about it
But seeing as they should be doing MUCH better than they are currently (lots of tourists at night, empty during day), I'll do my part to clue other red meat lovers in on this great new burger place
I've been going here since it opened and am never disappointed
The salads are great -- try the caesar, it's a meal in itself
The burgers are fabulous -- I usually get the Rare Classic with mushrooms and sauted onions
Big and juicy with perfectly cooked top-quality beef
Another thing I love about this place -- it's really really comfortable
Their booths are huge and soft, and there's enough space between them you don't have to listen to anyone else's conversation
Good place for burger in midtown
worth the price
Atmosphere and service very good
I have the Mexican burger with guac, salsa and a black bean spread
The burger was pretty good, but I still contend Island Burger is simply the best NYC has to offer
Still worth trying if you're into burgers
Went here on a quiet weekday afternoon
The burgers really arent that special
I had the RARE classic burger, which was just a typical burger
I heard good things about the burgers here and expected some sort of amazing taste
but it was just a burger like you can make at home
You can get anything you want on your hamburger, but the base price starts at $8 and goes up once you start adding anyhting to it
So you end up with a hamburger that costs over $10
The atmosphere is ok, service decent
If you love hamburgers, then go here
The food was excellent, I practically licked my plate clean
Although their specialty Frickle was weird (don't try it, it's a battered and fried pickle)
The crowd was a bit mixed, ranging from older folks to tourists (probably because it's inside a hotel) and the music was easy-listening style
We went for a work dinner and I would have preferred a younger, hipper crowd and atmosphere but for a nice dinner with tasty and relatively inexpensive burgers, this place is really good
Calling this a burger is a stretch, but eating it is a dream, and one that you should have
Couple that w/a super friendly and attentive staff (both waiters bar keeps), and excellent prices, and you're in for a great treat
Imagine hitting this place by accident and being treated to this wonderful experience, well that's what happened to me and now I want others to hear about it too!
What a treat! no nonsense just great burgers and fries and salads! and the nicest welcome in the neighborhood
Great burgers! great welcome, Good service! we had a ball!
I live in the neighborhood and just discovered a gem of a place
I first visited rare a couple weeks ago and have been back 4 times now and never disappointed
They have one of the BEST Turkey burgers I have ever eaten(and trust me im very picky about my turkey burgers)
The restaurant is beautiful and the staff are friendly and delightful
I will keep coming back because this is a RARE find!!! KKO
It is RARE for me to find a restaurant that combines food and atmosphere
Let's start with the food: Hands-down, the best burgers in the City
I went with a group of friends, and we were treated like royalty (I think it is connected to the Shelbourne Hotel)
It might be a crime to miss out on the burgers
This place will easily become a neighborhood hot-spot, although as it becomes more popular it might have to deal with being TOO popular (good for dates, business, groups etc
)
I'm RARELY impressed - but this is my new favorite place north of 14th Street
Can't go wrong by going to Rare
DO NOT GO THERE! We waited an hour and a half for sushi
(raw fish) The place was not even full! We were never told when the food was coming out or why it was taking so long
When it finally did come, it was wrong
We had specifically said at least three times NO wasabi in the rolls
We had to wait another 15 minutes for new sushi
We were almost done eating when the waiter finally came by to check on us
Our drinks sat empty, but our plates were cleared with food still on it

Though many of the dishes seem unnecessarily embellished and presentations occasionally outstrip flavor, this is nevertheless a food experience that any well-off-enough New Yorker should try at least once
Norma's was a great experience, it was my first time and I was pleasantly surprised! I was told to expect long line ups and pushy staff
I ended up getting a table in minutes even though the place looked busy, and the staff was sharp and trendy
All sweetened by smooth jazz music and out-of-this world french toast!!!
I have been to Norma's twice and ecah time I left the place with a happy stomach
Everything I have tasted so far has been very delicious (from eggs to pancakes)
My favourite meal of the day 's breakfast and this plave makes it all
Pricey? Yes
Worth it? Yes
WOW is the first word that comes to mind when talking about Norma's
After finally choosing banana-macadamia nut pancakes (a Hawaiian favorite of mine) after being unable to decide between 4 or 5 dishes that all sounded spectacular, I sat back and enjoyed the (complementary) tall shot glass of the smoothie of the day
As is expected if you're going to pay $7 for a glass, the orange juice was fantastic (and free refills!
also expected, haha) and freshly squeezed that day
The decor is very classy and modern, and there are pretty single flowers on each table
Then the food came
the pancakes were so good that no words I can express will do them justice
They had caramelized bananas mixed in the batter and had a wonderful texture and were just bursting with flavor
The walnuts and macadamia nuts on top were excellent with the pancakes, although I was less crazy about the brown sugar butter (but granted, I don't like ANY kind of butter on pancakes/waffles/french toast)
But absolutely fantastic pancakes, and every other dish I saw looked incredible as well
Expensive, yes ($30 breakfast with juice), but definitely worth it (at least once
)
There are a lot of little kids in the restaurant early on the weekend mornings though, just so you know, so it can get a little loud if one of them enters a sudden fit of tears/screaming
norma's has consistently been the best breakfast experience in nyc
i love coming here when i'm in town! from the minute you walk in the door, you're greeted with a friendly smile and the staff is well trained
you can't ask for any more - this is not your corner diner
everything from the food to service is delivered with perfection
for instance, i sat next to this couple who experienced problems with their food and the asked to speak to a manager
a young lady approached the table and she somehow managed to calm them down and assured them that everything would be taken care of - boy oh boy, were they the happiest customers in the world! props to norma's management
can't wait to see them again!
Some of the reviews mention that this place is pricey
WRONG! Let's break this down
Excellent ambience, good ambience, excellent presentation, servings large enough to serve two people (and I'm a 220lb
fitness fanatic, so believe me), quality ingredients
you can't go wrong
First of all, don't believe the bad reviews!  This place is incredible - I got the eggs benedict (delicious!!!) and my boyfriend got the blueberry pancakes (he ate it all!)
The portions are enormous and the food is fresh and superb
the OJ is pricy (7 dollars) but it's fresh squeezed that day (you can confirm by the taste) and you can have unlimited refills
It's a pricy place for breakfast, but remember it's in the parker meridien hotel so it's obviously not going to be cheap
If you want cheap try a diner or cafe somewhere else
Im going back to try the lunch menu and will go back for breakfast one more time before I leave new york
Ordered the Waz-za, and it was disgusting, yogurt over a waffle, and then they creme-bruleed it which translated to just burning the top
The fruit was mushy, and a glass of orange juice was $7!! Furthermore, had a 1pm reservation made weeks in advance and didnt get seated till at least 1:40
My wife I scheduled a brunch here during a recent trip
We knew the prices were on the high side, but the menu choices were too tempting to turn down
Banana macadamia nut pancakes for me and blueberry for the wife were outstanding! They only give you two, but since they are the size of a hubcap, that's all you can do
A side order of bacon was actually a value and it was piled high
The coffee is strong, so if you think Starbucks has strong coffee, you better order OJ
We were promptly seated (with reservations) and the service was good
If you're looking for value, stay home and go to IHOP
But if you want a really nice experience and a great meal, give this a try!
if you ever want to pay $35 for an egg-cellent brunch (ok, im stupid), then this is the place to go
the different varieties of eggs benedict are amazing
i especially recommend the normas eggs benedict which come on fluffy buttermilk pancakes instead of the standard english muffins
the artichoke eggs benedict come in a savory porcini mushroom sauce who knew that the artichoke, besides being a perfect vehicle for butter at a lobster restaurant, would also be a perfect nest for a poached egg at a breakfast place? contrary to normas recommendations, dont try the wazaa?, a belgian waffle topped with overly sour yogurt and fruit
stick with the eggs
orange juice is roughly $7 per glass, but its !!unlimited!! service is average and about as good as it can be for such a busy restaurant
definitely make reservations (its easy to do so via opentable)
Breakfast at Norma's is outstanding
However, there is major room for improvement
We were seated 1/2 an hour late, without a hint of an apology
The waiting area is extremely inadequate, with 40 people standing around in a bare hotel lobby
I am also surprised by the lacking decor: white walls and tan seating
French toast (albeit very fancy) costs $18, with all entree items between $16 and $22
What bothered me most was that the bill arrived without our requesting it, and without anyone asking if our food was ok, or if we desired anything else
I expect this at a diner, however I also pay half the price
To seat patrons late, charge posh prices, and then try to rush them out is bad business
Despite excellent food, I don't know if I will go back--Norma's should take better care of their customers if they want repeat visitors
I've read complaints about the food prices
well you can't please 'em all especially those that don't want to pay for a unique and tasty gourmet breakfast! This isn't Denny's or I-Hop so do not go expecting $6
99 specials! I consider Norma's fine dining for breakfast/brunch! Atmosphere: bustling, Food: to die for! Never had anything bad there
from lobster macaroni and cheese, to melt in your mouth salmon eggs benedict (a twist on the old ham), to pecan pancakes covered with fresh fruit toppings
The service is impeccable for such a busy place
For example
if you have any problem just be assertive enough to flag the waiter down (this is NYC) ask him nicely to fix it and he will as well as bringing something extra for your trouble
Understand that this is a VERY popular/busy place with an upscale menu and why is it so popular
do you have to ask?
Finally made it to Norma's to try the best breakfast in NY
It was a major disappointment
The food was below mediocre
My Waza waffle was awful, could not take more than three bites, it tasted like someone dumped salt on it
Waiter sent out a smoothie after I complained
My husband tried the Hudson duck hash, no flavor but we ate it to kill the taste of the horrendous waffle
Only good part was the French pressed coffee and getting out of there!
Sure it was! The food was really good and the service excellent
We had reservations but we wait an extra 15 minutes
The Wasa Waffle was different but when we spoke to the manager he inmediatly changed if for another dish (He suggested the Chocolate decadence French Toast
very good) The place is very nice but noisy
There was a table with some kids near to us but other than that everything was Excellent! It was our first time and we are planning to go back soon
Why does this place have such a high rating? Who are these people are saying anything good about it? This place is terribly expensive, the wait to sit down is interminable, with or without reservations, and the prices are really expensive (and the service is horrid)
Oh yeah, and the fodd? Eh
standard eggs benedict, and then whacky dishes like French toast swaddled in slices of cheddar cheese
Avoid avoid avoid
This place is so awful the service is bad, the wait is nearly interminable (even when you have reservations), and the price is expensive
There's NO reason to go this place in order to go though an experience like this
Bad bad bad; avoid at all costs
Do NOT believe the hype
Norma's is too expensive to have such shoddy service
Our group ordered three of their special waffles--the WaZaa
We'd had it before, and enjoyed it
This time, though, the sauce was off and the fruit was bad

Food is so-so, for the life of me, I couldn't tell the difference between this and an excellent dim-sum I had catered for Chinese New Year last week
Service can be spotty, altough cheerful
Unfortunately, I cannot eat decor and cheerfulness
The place looked great, the food was really mediocre
When you pay this much, and its a Jean-Georges, it should be way better than an average chinese resturant
Better off a few blocks east
Good for drinks, not for the food,
Vongerichten has done it again! Opulent yet minimalist, he's created the perfect spot
A gorgeous decor without becoming cheesy trendoid, coupled with a friendly, beautiful and considerate staff
The food is what you've come to expect , delicious, simple and flavor-FULL! SEXCELLENT! Thank you Jean-George
How bout trendy design, outratgeous prices and crappy service with food that doesn't need to be redone jean george style
I'd rather eat chinese food in chinatown, at a tenth of the cost
Does anyone else see similarities with the trendy but god awful food of Mercer Kitchen
Yes, it just opened, but all you have to do is look at the restaurants that Jean George has opened to see where this one is going
Except his amazing crown jewel, the epononymous Jean George, skip 66
great food, very attentive service and non intrusive, good music and a very minimalistic decor, felt like i was in a CK store
Waited ages for our entrees, over 1 hr w/ barely a 'sorry' from the waitress
entree was 'family sized' if you are a family of 1
decor: beautiful, food: tasty (eventually) but not remarkable and absolutely worth the price
Watered down drinks
Although based on her inability to answer any questions it was doubtful she had actually tried them
To top it all off, they overcharged our credit card, twice
Desperately trying to be trendy, forgets about quality
The Scene As at all of the other fiercely guarded sushi temples in the city, the sushi bar is fervently popular and always packed
Rightly so, as the restaurant bothers little with refining its decor, instead putting its efforts and money into sourcing seriously impressive fish
The dimly lit dining room in back is popular with walk-ins, and service is quick and can be a bit harried, but is always friendly
The Food The sashimi and sushi here can knock you out
Otoro tuna, gorgeously marbled with fat, is captivating; hamachi sashimi, topped by the chef with a whisper of sea salt and a barely-there squeeze of lemon, creates eye-rolling pleasure
Those who choose an omakase (chef's choice) menu will be happily surprised with accents of jalapeno or swaths of homemade sauce cleverly accenting rolls and sushi alike
But purists are rewarded as well, with some of the city's best sea urchin and abalone
Good steam in the engine! The word was that the staff from Gary opened this
seems like they brought the creativity with them
Twice we had enjoyed a late dinner here, but last night we vowed never to return
Arriving on time for our 11 pm reservation, we asked to be seated in the cozier back froom
They told us to wait
Despite the fact there were 20 diners there and two tables open - we were suddenly told the back room was not available at this hour
Instead they ordered us to eat at a cramped window table
When we objected to the chill coming in, they repeatedly snapped: You sit there! and refused to let me speak to a manager or to the owner - he's taking a break
Nobody offered any explanations and the woman in charge was indescribably nasty
After a 25 minute wait, we left
They've permanently lost us as customers
omakase is the only way to go
incredibly fresh fish that melts in your mouth
put yourself in the hands of chef seki and you're guaranteed an orgasmic foodie experience
the sea urchin is delectable
sushi here will cost a pretty penny, but is definately worth it
definately rivals sushi yasuda
This place was recommended to us a our Japanese friend
Indeed, this is Sushi Heaven
Sushi and sashimi are both delicious
If you like sushi, this is THE place to go
Omakase is definitely recommended
You will be suprised by how delicious sushi can be
Make sure you book a table before you go cos this place is so popular that it is busy Mon to Sun
Sushi is so fresh that fish is imported from Japan weekly
You have to try their Omakase
It is out of this world! Excellent service, delicious sushi
If you have tried sushi here, you don't want to go anywhere else
This place blows away all others
Very fresh salmon, tuna, and unagi
Prices are very reasonable for the quality you will be getting
Skip Yasuda, Nobu and the like
This place rocks
Trust me
Best in NYC
Very good creative sushi for reasonable price! I recommend omakase assortment sushi plate
Sake is also reasonably priced
then you want to head on up to Seki
I am fortunate in that I have a company expense account, and I entertain in the form of dinners with my clients at least once a week
Been to Nobu, Yashuda, Masa, Gari
For serious sashimi eaters, NO FISH BETTER than Seki!! Their chu toro, and yellowtail, baby yellowtail are like butter! And the chef's creations fantastic!
I have enjoyed eating at Sushi Seki for 2 years now and expect to return as long as they are open
They feature high quality and delicious food and the restaurant has a huge neighborhood following (i
e
they recognize and appreciate frequent repeat customers)
I highly recommend the sunomono and pretty much any of their rolls
The only (mild, small) suggestion I have would be for Sushi Seki to try adding new items to the menu
And if you know in advance you want to visit Sushi Seki during prime dinner hours, reservations are a MUST
After reading all the positive reviews, I came with high expectations
I was sadly disappointed
The fish was fresh, but
We ordered omakase
For sashimi, the chef gave us ONE plate to share (three pieces of each fish, about 6 types - how do you split that between two people?) and we each had about 10 pieces (which I felt were average compared to other places)
The bill came out to $100/person! I spent the same amount at Sushi of Gari and it was WAY more worth it
I would not return
Rather trek up a few more blocks to Gari
This place is one of my favorite staple sushi restaurants
it is quite delicious! i have had the omakase menu twice, and been to the restaurant about 15-20 times in the last year or so
the uni is the freshest i have ever had, and the spicey scallop roll is amazing
you can't go wrong here
i personally like seki's restaurant better than gari
Sushi Seki is also not that expensive, all things considered!!
Great restaurant for couples, since you may get to sit near the few tables by the window - otherwise, I'd recommend the sushi bar
The back of the restaurant, where most tables are, is cramped and dark, not to mention a few of them are right near the bathroom
But, avoiding that issue, the food is delicious! The Three Flowers special rolls ($28) are a must - though I must admit I've gotten the same rolls the 3 times I've ordered it, so I don't know why they don't just specify the rolls, but I guess it looks more imaginative when you say chef's choice
They also have a really fun seared tuna roll and a hijiki salad roll for vegetarians
My wife and I live a block away, and it took us 6 months to discover this place -- now we go almost every week! The sushi omakase is supreme
We have been to most celebrated sushi restaurants in NY (Nobu, Sushi of Gary, Yasuda, Bond Street, etc), and Seki compares favorably to all (perhaps with the exception of Nobu)
Sushi is fresh and inventive
Seki chooses the perfect combination of ingredients to highlight fish flavors (eel mushrooms, seared tuna tartar, yellowtail jalapeo)

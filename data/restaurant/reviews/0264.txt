Service was horrible but then again I return to many places with good food and poor service
In the end we each had a couple bites of our meals
The waiter asked if there was a problem and we told him we were disappointed
Thinking he would return to atleast listen to our we were surprised that he just handed us the bill and walked away
$100 wasted
STAY AWAY!!
I was looking for something little, quite, where you can sit and enjoy a well prepared dinner without paying an arm and a leg
Gnocco was the place to go! A party of six arrived at 10 pm, on a Tuesday
It was us and another table of pure Italians
A charming decor, the trendy tunes, and the polite service were only setting the stage for what was yet to come
The dishes and wine were exellent! The mussles so tasty, the risoto with safron and parmesan cheese out of this world and the following pasta dishes gave a strong sense of freashness and delightful taste
We had a blast! My friends were very pleased and we highly recommend it
Gnocco is a really nice Italian restaurant
The food is really authentic and very good
Those who go there have to try the gnocco fritto, absolutely
because they will not get it easily even in Italy outside emilia romagna!!!
Very cute restaurant that could easily cost $10 more per person, considering the quality of the food
However, the quality of the waitstaff seems to be declining from prior experiences
The food and atmosphere make you feel like you are very much back in Italy
The prices are reasonable and the menu is authentic
I'm sad that it is getting more and more crowded at this place! The food is very good, the garden in the back is beautiful in the summer and nothing is very expensive
The service is ok, which is acceptable due to the inexpensive prices
I've gone back many times
great food, great owner, one of the best italian without investing $100 @ Cipriani
Go to Gnocco and you will not be disappointed!!! Need I say more?
I keep going back for the gorgonzola pasta, it's heavenly and I'm addicted!!! Also very good is the pasta with lamb and tomato sauce
Great place to meet an old friend for a simple Italian meal
Strongly recommend sitting in the garden out back
Delicious!! The food is simply fantastic, the wait staff is very knowledgable of the menu and make great recommendations
You must try the Gnonno, it's especially good with the anti-pasto platter and parmasean cheese
The garden is a great place to eat, too
I just wish they took credit
Watch it people, you can seriously eat too much at this place
It's so delicious though
I don't think you can go wrong with any dish
You have to try the Gnocco, an appetizer the place is named after
I went to Gradisca a few weeks ago and thought it was very average
The homemade pasta was ok
Nothing to brag about
I had a waiter who I couldn't understand at all
He had a really thick accent and was impossible to figure out
The wine was ok
Overall, this place is just blah!!! I just went to Gonzos which is on the same street and it was delicious
If you want Italian and you're in that part of town
go to Gonzo instead
Simply put, the food at Gradisca is outstanding
It's not cheap and it's not plentiful, but it is divine
My meal was just a notch below some of the best meals I've had in Italy -- a level of quality that I didn't think existed on this side of the Atlantic
I would recommend any of their ravioli dishes
For dessert, try the pistachio gelato
It doesn't taste quite like the gelato you get in Italy, but it's fabulous nonetheless
YOU ARE ASPECTING TO PAY SOMETIMES MORE MONEY BUT GET VALUE FOR IT THIS IS MY THIRD TIME DINING IN AND
MY HUSBAND AND I DECIDE THAT UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT REPRESENTS THE ITALIAN CULINARY FACE OF ROMAGNA ANYMORE
WAS MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY FIRST OPEN
TOO MUCH PRESENTATION ON THE DISHES MICROSCOPIC PORTIONS UNBALANCED FLAVORS
I MAY HAVE TO GIVE THEM CREDIT BECAUSE THE PASTA'S ARE STILL QUIET OK ( NOT THE TORTELLI DI ZUCCA THOUGH ) BUT MY LORD, PLEASE REVIEWER CONTROL YOUR BADGET BEFORE YOU GO OUT IF YOU HAVE ONE ! $$$$$
This restaurant is perfect for any occasion
The food is excellent
The staff is super friendly
The atmosphere is very chill, cozy and can be romantic
I've been here a few times, once with a group of 8 girls, another time with one other friend, and another occasion with 3 friends
This place is great for any size group and it's also in a great neighborhood
close to all nightlife
This place is perfect for those nights when you want to go out but don't necessarily feel like going to a bar
A friend and I lingered her for about two hours, enjoying the music, ambience, food and wine
The space is very cool and dark - can be loud at times but didn't think bother us
The food was delicious - had a salad to start and the raviolis stuffed with buffalo motzarella
Great bottle of wine for $26
Service was lacking but we didn't mind because we were in no rush - they weren't rude or anything - in fact very friendly and apologetic but were slow and forgetful
Still will be back soon
This charming little Italian place easily made me one of their return customers
I love the food, i love the atmosphere, i love the people of gradisca
I feel like i am home even though I am not Italian
I guess it has something to do with being Mediterranean
Even an italian friend told me once 'you find one of the most authentic italian restaurant in the city'
And I aggree
Whatelse I can say
Highly recommended!
Ristorante altamente raccomandato che esporta il tipico sapore della trattoria del nord est italiano
Cuoco di Trieste e camerieri tutti italiani per un ambiente piacevole e che mi ha stupito in positivo, Buon Appetito! Highly Raccomended restaurant that exports the typical flavor of the north east of Italy Trattoria
The Cook is from Trieste and waiters all italians for a great enviroment that amazed me, Buon Appetito!
Now I understand why all my Italian friends go to Gradisca for a night of great Italian food
Its just like going to a real trattoria in Italy, with a cool touch of the New York scene
I had such a great time and I felt like I was back home for a while
The food was fabulous and authentically Italian
The owners, the chef and most of the people I met were Italian too, and there were a lot of Italians eating in the restaurant
If you are looking for the real thing Gradisca is the place to go
Gradisca is a fantastic place for a group of friends or a date
Its fun, but can also be great for a romantic night out
Everything I've had at Gradisca has always been fantastic and the food is unique while pleasing to the more discriminating palates
The service is great and you'll find the owner to be friendly and willing to please
I had a birthday dinner at Gradisca, and I can't remember ever having had a better time
The food and drinks were delicious (try the fresh watermelon martini; it's unbelievable
) and the staff was so attentive
The atmosphere was really great too--we had a blast
In short, if you enjoy eating well and being treated like a VIP, try Gradisca
With so many wonderful and intimate West Village restaurants around, why would you bother going back to Gradisca? The food is uncreative and bland
The setting is college basement
However, the service is great
For the same money, go to Gonzo or Crispo instead

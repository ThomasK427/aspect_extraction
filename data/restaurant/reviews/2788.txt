has lot of choice, sun dae is one of top choice, s
This place is an awesome find, it is out of the way but it is not some tiny resturant it is very spacious and the food is soooooo good
very fresh seafood
I have been coming here for a few years now and i cannot say enough about it
and as for the parking problem the other reviewer meantioned maybe he/she didnt realize that the resturant has a parking lot right next to it
I've been to Spicy Tasty a couple of times, and have been thoroughly impressed on both occasions
The food is much more delicate and flavorful than at your corner Chinese restaurant
The sesame noodles were sweet, light, and not syrupy like at other places
The shrimp with rice cakes was fresh and chewy, and the menu has plenty of special spicy dishes for the brave
I went with a very large group on a recent Saturday night, having called ahead of time, and the staff worked hard to seat us all together and create a great dining environment
This is a fun place in the heart of Flushing that all Sezchuan food lovers must try!
the real deal, and the name of the restaurant says it all
crowded on a Friday night, so we had to bop on over to the Sheraton for a cold one to kill a half-hour
interaction with waiter a bit tough given our lack of Chinese-speaking ability, but he guided us through a wonderful evening
the cold noodles rock, and the shrimp and beef cooked in the boiling flavor-pot in front of us was scrumptious
a fondue-party feel with heat and unique flavors
just a few blocks off the great seven line
What a great restaurant! I live in the neighborhood, and had never eaten at this restaurant before
I went with a large group, and we were seated promptly! The food was great, the atmosphere was comfortable, and the owners and the chef came to our table to make sure we were hapy with our meals
The menu is diverse, but everything is great! Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed their meals
Even if you don't live in the area, it will be worth your trip! I will go back again and again
Highly recommended! A+
I found this restaurant through CitySearch, and brought some friends here, despite never dining at Friends Co
before
Let me tell you that the gamble paid off as this is a top-notch place in a great location
I have been back there several times, and highly recommend it to anyone within the Queens vicinity
With great food and even better service, what's not to love?
Friends surprised me by being tucked away in such a random locale
We walked from the LIRR and I was surprised at how convenient that was
We had gone for a private party in their cute and elegant back room and was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful service, the delicious fare and the enjoyable atmosphere
We were so relaxed
We felt right at home
I have gone back several times after this and always have a good time
The owners are there mingling with the customers
They are always courteous and prompt and the food continues to dazzle me
Oh and the bar itself is just a great place to have a drink, watch a game or talk to people
Friends is truly a pleasant and memorable dining experience

is a classic dim sum barn, but significantly less noisy than most, and the big windows prevent that trapped-in-a-cave feeling you get at places like Manhattan's Triple 8 Palace
This place has ruined me for any other dim sum
It's the best
Warning: some of the cart items, such as the baby pig, are not cheap
It's delicious and worth the price; just don't assume your bill will be tiny unless you know exactly what you're ordering
Be prepared to be somewhat aggressive in requesting items from the carts
There's a huge municipal parking lot right across the street; and the last stop on the 7 train is a block or two away
You could also take the LIRR there
This summer they've been closed for renovations, so call to make sure they're open
This is by far the best slice of pizza in NY
No Kidding!!!!!
I have eaten at Lucia's for over 20 years
I'm in the middle-east right now and can't wait to go back home to taste their delicious pizza again
I travel from woodside to taste this pizza it is so so so so so good
I HAVE BEEN EATING AT LUCIA PIZZA FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS AND IT IS DEFINITELY THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER EATEN (I AM 47 YEARS OLD AND HAVE EATEN A LOT OF PIZZA IN MY LIFE!) ALTHOUGH IT IS A SMALL SPACE, IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE
THE TURNOVER IS SO GREAT, THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO IN AT 1 PM, ORDER A LARGE PIE, AND BE OUT THE DOOR AT 1:05! BECAUSE OF THE TURNOVER, THERE IS ALWAYS A FRESH SLICE WAITING FOR YOU AT LUCIA PIZZA!
I've been coming to Lucia's for over 20+ years and it truly is the best tasting pizza in NY
It's so good that I travel 30 minutes to an hour a few times a year just to get a couple of their slices
You won't be disappointed
This is not a place to sit down and relax, but this is THE place for delicious pizza served lightening fast
I'm very picky about pizza, and while the pizza is a bit messy to eat, the taste and texture more than make up for it
The place has been there for over 30 years in a neighborhood where places go out of business ever other month
I've been going there for over 7 years and will continue to do so
i have been going to this place since i was 5 years old
it's a flushing cornerstone! They put just the right amount of cheese and sauce to make it worthwhile
The place is a very small, cramped place, and it's likely to be crowded at peak times of the day, but it's the best pizza around, great for a quick bite to eat
i've found that nobody can eat just one slice; they have to have another
the people there are so friendly, they don't mind striking up a conversation with you if they're not busy
I've been going to this place for about 10 years now and all other pizzerias pale in comparison
The best NY has to offer!
If you want a great tasting b-day cake, this is the place to go to
it's the best!!! Strawberry and green tea are the best flavor
The cream is light as air!!!
If you ever want to eat something spicy and hot, this sure is the right spot
This Restaurant is very famous for its Kababs, Breads, Samosas and Tandori specialties
Gets my vote for best coffee in New York and you can't beat the steak eggs for value
This place serves by far the best buddhist vegetarian dishes, especially if you're looking for dim sum
We love the rice in lotus leave, the beef chow fun, and the ribs
Skip the chow mein
The traditional menu is great, and the more creative dishes are hit or miss
Service is decent, I only met 1 bad staff of all the times I've visited
Price is expensive for Flushing but good value for this type of cuisine
They offer Kosher too
This is one of the best pizzerias in Queens
Their sauce is delicious, pizza isn't too greasy, and the crust is perfect, not too thin, not too thick
Very bad steak, these people do not know how to cook a steak
Save your money and spend it elsewhere
Mcdonalds taste better
I love this steakhouse
The prices are very reasonable, and the service is very courteous
Unfortunately the weekends it tends to get busy
But now they have a call ahead service to minimize you wait time
The food is excellent, the prices are reasonable
Great location - just seconds from the Cross Island Parkway, Whitestone Bridge, exit off of the Whitestone Pkwy / Van Wyck Expwy
This steakhouse is not so shabby
The service is probably its best quality
The food is not five star but the prices reflect that
I've been to the Outback and I thought they were comparable to Boulder Creek except Outback prices were through the roof
If your looking for a high priced steak with high expectations this may not be the place for you
If you venture into Boulder Creek you will get great service and a decent meal (not the worst you can find but not the very best you can find)
The place is family oriented and is crowded on weekends; weekdays it is more quiet

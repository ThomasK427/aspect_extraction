The wines they chose for us was SPOT ON
USC created a perfect anniversary, right down to the NO SINGING ANNIVERSARY cake with candles, just a subtle, happy anniversary with a smile
Simple and just right
In Short With its soft lighting, intimate banquettes and low noise level, it's no wonder this casual spot is so beloved by NYU students and professionals for lunch and dinner
On the extensive Japanese menu, servers steer guests to lesser-known specialties such as the teriyaki yellowtail cheek, tuna tataki and buri (young yellowtail sushi)
Diners traveling in groups have the option to sit at the restaurant's one traditional low table
The fish portions are very large, but the quality of the fish is definately not the one somebody would expect for that price range
A great place if you are HUNGRY and you want sushi
However, if you are looking for high quality sushi, better try something else
I don't like the ambience at all
The sushi, however, is quite good
Their entrees aren't so bad either
But honestly though, every single item on their menu is overpriced
You can get the same quality food elsewhere for half the price
At least the service was good and attentive
Good restaraunt
The sushi is quite good
The waiter was friendly and pleasant
Will go again
We dined here tonight and the sushi was average
probably will not return
the service was excellent
There are a lot of good sushi places in NYC, but something about Japonica's highest quality food, impeccable service, and warm and inviting interior that makes it a special trip even for a neighborhood haunt
Its my favorite sushi in NYC and I love their cooked food, too
The hardest part is deciding whether to get a warm entree or sushi (I usually get something of both!)
Excellent seasonal fish
Omakase included some imported fish from Japan
Knowlegable Japanese staff
Very Japanese
While this restaurant is slightly pricey for what you get, the sushi is superb
The atmosphere is pleasant except for when the restaurant is overly crowded and therefore noisy on weekend nights
Service however, always remains top-notch
So my girlfriend came home from dinner one night with her friend and told me we had to have dinner at Japonica
So I went with one thing in mind - brown rice sushi
I was pleasantly surprised
We are avid sushi eaters and brown rice is definitely a healthier alternative to white
The fish was very fresh and the pieces were a very nice size
The owner/manager was super friendly and the waiters were very attentive
I would highly recommend this restaurant although it is a little pricey
Rolls are about $10
It was over $100 for two people and we only drank Diet Cokes
:(
This place might have cut it when there were no other sushi places around
It feels like 80s sushi- old! Way to overpriced for tiny, slimy rolls and completely lacking any kind of creativity
I understand there is such a thing as traditional sushi, but this is just boring and stale
food/value: portions are large
fish is very fresh and well-cut
the menu is extensive
dishes other than sushi are varied and well-prepared
beautiful soup
service: swift, friendly, and accomodating
they went out of their way to bring extras, including complementary treats
we once had a wonderful birthday celebration there
i hope to one day be known as a regular here
ambience: the tatami room is pleasant and quiet--perfect for an intimate gathering
the rest of the restaurant feels cozy and friendly--not too crowded
while the outside isn't so impressive, this is more than made up for in food and atmosphere
never too empty, but you can always find a seat without too much wait
Very generous portions - the largest pieces of sushi I've ever seen
The beef terriyaki is another favorite of mine here
Good for the money
I've eaten here quite a number of times - what I don't get is why the place is never crowded
This is my favorite Japanese restaurant
The food is always delicious and fresh
The service is always efficient
My only complaint is that I've been visiting Japonica for over 10 years and they NEVER recognize me
That's bad business
It's also not a pretty place but I'll always come back for more
Love this place! The pieces of sushi are tremendous and so fresh tasting! It is worth what you pay here because again, the pieces are so big! I have never seen any place serve bigger pieces of sushi! Atmosphere is causal, nothing too zen like
There is usually a wait but they get their patrons in and out pretty quick
Last time I went here, my husband and I had a quick sushi and cold sake lunch, then went for a massage! Awesome saturday afternoon!!
This place had both a nice ambiance and good food
the service was excellent - but in all honesty I did go on a sunday night so it was less crowded
The fish was very fresh though and I thought they were making an effort to give you a meal worth the price they were charging
Unlike Nobu's small pieces for 33% more $$, Japonica is worth the cost
It's really hard to find good sushi, and just because you throw money at it, doesn't mean that you'll get what you paid for
Japonica is just that
I went, threw lots and lots of money on average food that I could've eaten anywhere else for way less
Plus, everything comes in small to average portions, so the next time you get a sushi craving, I don't recommend that you go here
Japonica is a quite place to eat delicious, jumbo-sized sushi
The dinner usually costs you around $35 - $50 per person
It is pricey, but the service and the qulity of food is consistent
What a cute little place
This was our absolutely favorite place in 2003, when the baguettes were fresh and the delicious sandwich and soup offerings were unique
Since then, they've come down in quality and service, often times bringing everything out at the same time when an appetizer soup should've come out first
Still, it's a cute place for breakfast/brunch on a weekend
Be careful, it's getting too popular and, therefore, crowded
This place is one of my fave! Soooooo cozy and intimate, and they bake everything right there - including the bread used for sandwiches! :-) The staff are very friendly
No one really knows about this place but lunch time gets really busy
Try their apple pocket - it's THE best pastry I have ever tasted, and I am a baked goods freak
:-) Love this place!
What I liked - the food, the prices, the atmosphere
The quirks - You may not have jam with your scones or mustard on your sandwich
My request for a second tea pot to strain the tea into so that it would not overbrew was denied
The waitress did bring me a second cup to strain into instead
In short, the customer is not always right, but keeps coming back
this is like a little hidden jewel
the rustic ambience is made even more pleasant by the polite staff
it's quiet and never crowded - perfect for a brunch for a couple or 4 at the most
even though it's japanese-owned, someone in the kitchen must've trained in France at some point: the croissants pain au chocolats are exactly what you'll get in Paris

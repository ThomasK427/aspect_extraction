i went with my friend and the experince was great the bartender was excellent and the food was great
i recomend this resturant to any one that has a taste for italian food
at the bar i had alot of fun and the drinks just kept on coming
highly recommended
We arrived at 10 on a Saturday night and had about an hour and a half wait
Bartender downstairs was very friendly made our long wait in the small and cramped bar area tolerable
The menu is fairly limited, but the nightly specials are what makes this place so great
The ricotta and spinach ravioli was divine - melt in your mouth delicious
They also give you the option of changing the sauce that's offered with each pasta on the menu
Fairly limited wine selection (by the glass)
Maitre d sent us over dessert wine after dinner
Although small, cramped and you have to be willing to wait it out for a table, the specials are definitely worth a return trip
My favorite Italian in the EV
The owner is a real hothead and embarassed us in front of a room of patrons
After being told that we would be seated in 1/2 hour, we waited nearly two hours
When my husband said something to the owner he yelled that we could eat at another restaurant and repeatedly shouted at my husband that he had no class
We left without eating
I'm from Italy and everyone in my country puts cheese on their pasta so this guy needs to lighten up
The food is ok
But honestly, there is just NO need for this kind of attitude at a restaurant
Just not necessary, no matter how good the food is
It's not the customers, it's the restaurant staff
I'll be the first to tell you the owner can be gruff with his patrons, but c'mon does anyone really care to hear about some dude getting kicked out because he wanted a checkin ticket for his bag? For those of you that need more pampering, you might want to go somewhere else
Maybe more midtown/uptown, I dunno
But if you want a place with solid pasta dishes, strong drinks, and a festive atmosphere this is your place
I had a good meal and ok service at my first visit so on Sat I went for the second time
My bf came directly from the airport so he had his luggae with him
Upon his arrival the staff checked in his bags and put them in the storage room, but when my bf asked for a check-in ticket, the host refused to give one and threw the bags back at us
He said he wouldn't take the responsibility and got into an argument with my bf as he was being very rude
then he said - I am not going to seat you tonight, you are not having dinner at my restaurant with that kind of attitude
We were so shocked as we didn't think it was such a big deal
This experience totally ruined my Sat night and I won't go back again
Where to begin? I went thru the trouble of registering just so I could add my two cents about how this formerly service-oriented, romantic restaurant has changed
Food: Not as good as it once was, probably b/c in its haste to turn tables, Il Baggatto now prepares everything ahead of time
I can understand preparing pasta this way but my Halibut came approx 5-10 minutes after ordering
Service: Had check delivered (twice!) w/o asking
after sitting down for under an hour
When I mentioned this to the owner after dinner, he said (1) we're busy and we have to turn the tables and (2) just b/c we give you the check doesn't mean you have to pay it and leave
Funny, I thought thats exactly what it means!  I'm not a complainer but if this had been our first date or a special occasion, it would have been awful
A small, dark, cosy, casual restaurant with delicious freshly cooked pasta and a great wine list contributing to a complete and pleasurable dining experience
we had 9:00 reservations, we were there at 8:30
We were seated at almost 11:00
We got the Seinfeld at the Chinese restaraunt bit
10 more minutes the owner did throw us a plate of toasted bread and mushy tomatos after waiting 40 minutes
Once we were seated we all orderd pasta that took another 40 minutes , we ate at almost 12:00 and it wasn't much different from what I could make at home
We would have ordered the fish , but every minute there was another anouncement of what wasn't available
Anyway after witnessing the owner abusing some of the staff and scarfing down the college dorm made pasta we left; the momentum of the night gone we were all drained from the bad dining experience and just went home
The service here was the worst I ever encountered
However, the food is good, but the experience of these people made me leave with a bad taste in my mouth
I should of listened to another friend of mine who is currently boycotting this place due to the service
Make an early reservation or you be cramped inside their tiny bar area like cattle
Oh yeah- good luck on getting a drink while eating- takes forever! Honestly, if you live in the area you should totally do take out- the food is worth that much!
I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting an enjoyable italian meal
Their famous Gnocci was very forgettable and had a bitter after taste
When I asked my server if they could do anything about it, he said that was their specialty, and I must be wrong about the food
Maybe I expect too much, but he should've offered to make it right
I went with a large group, and they are definitely not equipped to deal with parties over 4
The service was very slow, and the server never checked in with us until it was time to pay the check
It took 15 minutes to get a drink from the bar
Il Bagatto threw me for a loop when I visited the restaurant
The food was very good and I enjoyed my meal, but I felt extremely uncomfortable when they gave me a threatening eye when I asked for Parmesan cheese on my food
Not only do they charge extra for this necessary cheese, but they snarl at you and look at you like you have 10 heads when you request it
In turn, I requested parmesan cheese on every dish I ordered including the chocolate cake at the end
They didn't take it too well considering I received a look from every employee in the joint as if they were whispering in the kitchen we must destroy the parmesan guy
Here is an analogy for this restaurant KERRY: BUSH = iL BAGATTO : PARMESAN CHEESE
i made a reservation a week in advance for Saturday at  8:30pm
I was away from my phone all day Saturday, but the restaurant left me a message at noon saying my reservation had been cancelled
I called back at 6 p
m
when I got the message and immediately called the restaurant
i was put on hold for over 3 minutes and when i finally spoke to someone i was told, sorry, but we can only seat you at 10:30 p
m
i wouldn't know how the food is since they denied me the chance to try it, but i can say that this is not a very cool east village vibe
I was for the first time at this famous restaurant for Mother's day yesterday, and wow!!! The food is amazing
the seafood dish i had was out of this world
My daughter's pasta was excellent, and she finished everything (she never does
typical of a 4 yr
old) which tells you how great it was
Ok, i was a bit surprised about the cheese thing, but even more so about the big issue some of the people on this site try to turn it into
god
just pay the 3$ if you want it on your seafood dish
Besides, the prices are so downright that it is so worth it; although like it says it on the menu
you will not need it
The dish in it self is good enough without it, or rather way beyond that
Il Bagatto is a MUST!!
I used to love this place, great, cheap food
But recently, I planned a large party there and was called by a host the day before to confirm
When I said we needed to cancel, he proceeded to yell at me and went on to tell me how rude I am
I'm pretty sure Il Bagatto had no problem filling that table that night
There was no reason for this guy to go off on me
They may have good food, but hell this is NYC, go to Supper, Max's or Perbacco for great, cheap italian food and friendly service
Read the reviews, Il Bagatto needs to lighten up and clean up their act before their competitor's take all their customers
The place, food and service were all top notch
Best part is the value
Will go again and again
I went to here with a party of 10
All the entrees arrived, but mine
I patiently waited since they were being served 2 at a time
I finally inquired about my food- they had forgot to order it
This is bad enough, but they offered no solution (ie, a quicker dish, something that was already prepared) and had an attitude about it

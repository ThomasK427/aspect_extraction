Agree, that this is a great afterwork place or a first date (i
e
, not too, too romantic) place
This restaurant is confusing
Some nights, the service is great and the sushi is super fresh-I really enjoy it
And, the bill is always reasonable
Other nights, however, service can be pretty bad and really slow (even if the restaurant is not crowded) and the sushi tastes as if it has been in the tackle box a little too long
On average, I have had two wonderful visits and then a visit that makes me avoid the place for a month
By any measure, it is worth a try to see for yourself
I'll go back soon because the last meal was pretty good
I'm not a sushi snob by any stretch (I usually refer to sushi as bait or chum), but I actually enjoyed it here
The tempura was very good, but then again, I don't think I've ever had BAD tempura
The service was prompt, friendly and attentive
All around a very nice experience
Male host almost seemed to bark order at our seating and request
Not friendly at all nor attentive
Food was fine but no big deal
Prices are no great deal either
Lunch crowd is busy loud at times
I was raised in Japan and have had sushi a hundred times so I know the way of sushi
the rice is too firm, and it seems they select cheap rice
freshness is as same as a 8 dollar sushi lunch box in midtown
i cant see any skills in their sushi
just do not order sushi,its not worth to pay near 20 bucks
you can definitely find better sushi somewhere else in manhattan
i don know why the other people say their sushi is good
tempura is alright
I have been dragged all over the city by sushi snobs, and there is no place I would rather go (with or without them) than Zutto
Great service, nice and calm environment, impeccable sushi
Its too bad they closed the Carmine street location
Eschew Nobu
Zutto's is a great afterwork spot, like the other have said, a better alternative to the other pricey Japanese spots in the city
The food is always great and the sake selection is very nice
I am a bit confused @ the reviwer who has a problem with a Japanese restaurant who's staff is Japanese
Hmmm
lol It's a JAPANESE restaurant
Who do you want to run it? When I go to a restaurant geared towards a specific culture/food, I want as authentic experience as possible, and Zuttos fit's the bill for me and my friends!
This was the best sushi I've ever eaten
The waitstaff and atmosphere was slightly pretentious but who cares when the food you are eating is that good!
i usually dont rate 10's but i had to offset the completely unrealistic 4 given by a previous reveiwer who goes to a japanese resturant and complains about the japanese staff? the sushi is among the best i have had, the staff are polite and helpfull (consistenly good sake recomendations)
i took some coworkers who were in from japan to zutto and they rated it very high - need i say more
Folks, the chef at Zutto makes the restaurant what it is! I'm from St
Louis, MO and I've been going to Zutto for sushi and sashimi specials since August of 2000
Each week, Zutto's sushi chef never ceases to amaze me with new concoctions
He is the king of matching delectable sauces with high quality fish
If you're considering going, you need to be aware of one thing
To experience Zutto to the fullest, you MUST sit at the bar
You will only get the finest treatment there
Ask for the sashimi specials, and you will want to return weekly as I have for the last 2
5 years! My hat is off to Zutto and the chef's amazing talent!
Described as an affordable alternative to Nobu, Zutto lived up to and surpassed every one of my expectations-- except the wait staff, who neglected our water glasses
Regardless, the sushi was superb
I took my guy there for his birthday since softly decorated japanese restaurants are hard to come by in this city
Zutto is a gem!!
I just recently checked out the Zutto on 174 Bleecker Street and it was nothing shy of excellent
The food is incredible and the service is friendly
The outdoor garden is a perfect spot for a date
I've been going to Zutto since 1998 and they have yet to disappoint
Their sake samples are QUITE pleasing and you are almost never lacking in a huge portion when it comes to meals
Although a big packed on the inside, Zutto is a great alternative to the high price sushi restaurants
good sushi, service and atmosphere at a good price
recently went here for a quiet birthday dinner and everything was great
the sushi was good, the special app of the evening
oysters in red wine sauce was amazing
and the sake excellent
the service was very good and pleasant
Fantastic alternative to Nobu--and right down the block
The fine sushi, amazing sake selection (try the extra-dry) and warm setting make it an appealing dinner spot
The Scene During the day, this clean, simple space bustles with lunching jurors and city employees; at night, it mellows into a festive dinner spot for largely Asian groups and couples
The swift, skilled staff is ready with advice or banter
The Food The wide array of affordable Vietnamese food is a blessing for New Yorkers, especially those on jury duty
Fragrant pho, a beef noodle soup, teems with tender rice noodles and flavors of herbs and onion in a profoundly comforting broth
Deep-fried spring rolls are delicate, crisp and full-flavored
There's a plethora of seafood selections, including succulent squid in a glaze of garlic, chili and lemongrass
And the superlative barbecue-seasoned pork chop, pounded thin and served on the bone, exudes a smoky tang
The menu also includes savory casseroles and a wonderful "hollow vegetable" stir-fry among the small selection of vegetable dishes
ive been here a couple times before and found their food to be fast, cheap, and consistent
my friends and i came here on friday night for dinner and our food came within 5 minutes of ordering
theres almost always a wait for a table, but the turnover is really quick, so ive never had to wait for long
the pho broth is standard and not very flavourful, but the hot soupy beefy noodles are comforting on chilly nights
the slices of beef are tender, and while the restaurant is heavy-handed on the noodles, they tend to skimp on the meats
the cold fresh vermicelli with shrimp peanut sauce is a cooler lighter alternative for hot summer nights
overall, a good place to go if youre in a hurry and not looking to spend more than $8 (including tax + tip)
I've been eating here for 13 years
Food is consistent
Been ordering L18 (chicken w/ lemongrass over rice) forever
Try the garlic fried squid
It's tasty! Top it w/ the green bean drink
Finally, a place where the pho isn't greasy! I had pho suon nuong (pork chop noodle soup), and the stock was nice and clear ($4
50!)
They gave us plenty of herbs, too
However, the pork chop was a bit tough, and the steamed omelet that came with the com bi suon nuong was pretty small
I have been there so many times
feels like home
The waiters are all fast and helpfull
Sometimes the main dishes will arrive before the appetizers, but doesn't really matter! The service is very fast
The most delicious dishes for me? Crispy squid, shrimp with black mushrooms in salt and pepper sauce and the beef with watercress and with oyster sauce
I'm actually going right now!
byeeee!!!
I was dying for a good summer roll with peanut sauce

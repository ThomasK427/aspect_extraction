Whenever we have out-of-town guests, we bring them here
The drink menu is very innovative, and we like the wine selection
On Valentine's Day, they had a very creative menu special for the day
I would recommend calling ahead, but if you have to wait for a table, they have a beautiful modern bar you can wait at
Enjoy!!
citrus has a wonderful, upbeat atmosphere
the food is good, but not great
the drinks are ok - try the red sangria
I always have a great meal at Citrus
Love the sushi and quesadillas
Margaritas are a nice complement to the meal
The place is stylish, busy and has lots of energy! Great place for dinner with friends
I have been to Citrus many times
Its always been great food, good service, fun drinks and an enjoyable time
The menu has a great selection, you can always try something new; however, the chicken salad is incredible! The ambiance has so much energy - it can be great for a date, or party out with friends
I have never done wrong at Citrus! Its a experience you will definitely enjoy:)
pretty mediocre, if truth be told
Nothing more annoying than having someone whose first language is not English to balls up your reservation and then not bother apologising for it when challenged
Nice decor though
Have been here several times and each time was a delight! Always treated well by the staff and seated promptly
WHEN I had a reservation
I wouldn't recommend going without one, this place is really busy
When I didn't have a res, I simply grabbed a place at the bar, sipped on a yummy white sangria and chatted it up with the friendly bartenders until a table was available
Food is great, drinks are better and the service is wonderful
This place is a must!
This review is in regard to News Years only
I haven't eaten here, but I have heard good things
Cost was $130 for open bar and finger food
Food was so-so
Went there with about 8 people and we all felt the same
The place didn't sell out and the crowd was mediocre at best
Many people left before midnight
Wouldn't go back again for New Years
I've lost track of the number of times I've been to Citrus Grill
As most previous reviewers, save one, agree, the margaritas are amazing
As for the menu, I've never been disappointed, but the Margarita chicken salad is my favorite
Testament to its tastiness is the fact that when my 3 best friends and I have dinner here (which is often) we all order this salad, including the one who tends to eschew anything green
Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants
Citrus is a great place, great for food, drinks, or both
Their margaritas are great (My fav is the Rasberry, with Chambord!) Its my boyfriend's favorite restaurant, as he says, he spends half his income there! Overall, good price, good choices, and great drinks! The wait staff is very attentive, and the hot salsa is a great starter to any meal
This place has a great buzz to it! Very friendly and prompt service
Looks like it would be great for a large party
Went for brunch on Sunday and didn't have to wait (rare for upper west side)
Service was friendly, food was good, and the french toast was FANTASTIC!
I am quite upset
This used to be one of my favorite restaurants to eat at on the UWS untill a friend of mine showed me an article in the NY Times about the management taking a % of the waiters' Tips!!!! Still, I will probably go for a Brunch here or there
(it's Fantastic!) But I just don't feel the same about the restaurant after reading that article
Everyone has always been most hospitable
Service can be a bit slow when the restaurant fills up but the food and atmosphere is worth it
Try the Pizza!
I would recommend this place because the food was great
It was pretty crowded but the waiter provided great service
I sat outside so I didn't get the dining experience inside
but I would definately recommend this to anyone that wants to eat good italian food
It was nice because outside there was a mix of people from corporate to more casual mix making it very nice and confortable
Will go back for sure!
I've been to Fiorellos several times and the seafood/vegetable bar is definitely the way to go
Go a little early for dinner and you'll usually find a spot at the bar
The service is excellent, waiters very nice, food is wonderful and there is usually great conversation to strike up with the stranger next to you
My sister and I went this weekend and although she is not easy to please gastronomically, she loved it too
Sitting in the dining room is more expensive and a totally different experience - not at all my preference
This is one of my favorite brunch restaurants
The pizza, although pricey, is absolutely delicious! The UWS isn't necessarily my favorite place to dine, but this is definitely worthe the trip!
We were there before the rush
Not a lot of patrons, just plenty of waiters
Coffee delivered too late
We had to find anyone to give us a bread basket, which was supposedly included in meal
We had to find a waiter for the check
Just across from Lincoln Center
Come on people
You could do much better
Went here for mother's day dinner, was seated promptly with a 6:30 reservation
Waiter was wonderful and very helpful in helping us decide
Fried artichokes were amazing, so was the chocolate mouse desert, they are definitly not skimpy in that area
One of the best meals i've head uptown
Found on a trip to Lincoln Center
Absolutely LOVED it
it was rather crowded for a saturday brunch and my table was a BIT too close to the table next to me
BUT! the food was an absolute treat
I had a seafood linguine and my friend had salmon over spinach
Both of us are quite critical of food- but it was absolutely wonderful
The mussels were free of sand (that almost never happens) and the spinach was fresh and sauteed just right
And, not to mention, we sat at the booth specifically reserved for Pavarotti
Service could have been better, but it was a crowded day so I'll forgive them
My girlfreind and I were looking for a nice place to grab a bite when we came across Cafe Fiorello
Our waiter showed up and took our drink order and appetizer order
Our waiter seemed more interested in walking the isles ignoring us than see if we needed anything else
I called him over and asked if the food and wine were going to take much longer? He replied that our wine was being delivered from downstairs and our food was almost ready
An eternity later our food was hastily delivered
If the food were good perhaps there would be some sort of redeeming quality, no luck
Bland, devoid of any semblance of creativity yet expensive
We asked for the check and our lackluster waiter realizing we were not happy decided to condescendingly wish us a wonderful evening
I wouldn't stop in this restaurant again to use the restroom
I was beginning to believe that all hosts and waiters were becoming robots until I dined with Fiorello's
Our party was greeted with smiles and personality
Our coats were checked immediately and we were sat in the middle of the main dining room
The service was above and beyond anything that I've seen in a long time
Not only was the waiter very professional but he was also having a great time with us
I personally never see that anymore
The food was unoriginal and a little bland, but I didn't let it ruin my night

The Shrimp Quesadilla had maybe 2 sml shrimp in it and the cheese was gummy
The place is noisy, has an old bar kind of smell, and not much for decor
The Margaritas were below average at best
I won't come back
I'm from Dallas, so I'm quite discriminating when it comes to Tex-Mex
This place does it right, and the prices remind me more of Texas than New York
The Northeast's version of Mexican food baffles me
sangria is Spanish not Mexican, and chips and salsa should always be complimentary
Cancun makes me feel at home
Cancun also has AWESOME Margaritas: strawberry, raspberry, coconut, coconut/strawberry, banana, strawberry/banana, melon, peach, mango, just about any flavor
All of their drinks are great (and strong)
I work close to the Cancun Restaurant and love to come here for lunch or after-work margaritas
The food is delish!!!
Coming from Texas I've searched for great mexican food and I've found the closest to it
The margaritas are strong and very good, the chips and salsa are bottomless with just the right spice and the food is great and you can have as many tortillas as you want! Plus, it's reasonably priced! I definately recommend to all the southerners looking for a mexican fix
The Scene The long, narrow restaurant feels like it could have been imported from a Malibu roadside
The colorful interior features bright orange-and-red tables, along with paintings and mirrors rendered in the shape of surfboards
Waitstaff go about their work with all the lackadaisical flourish befitting a casual hamburger joint
The Food Both the burgers and grilled chicken breast sandwiches rank among the best in New York
The charred-on-the-outside, fist-sized patties are cooked precisely to order, and the menu touts a dizzying 63 varieties of burger and bird, with everything from the basic with cheese to more elaborate concoctions like the satisfying Derby (with bacon, real blue cheese and sliced avocado)
Whatever you order, rich, buttery sauteed onions are a must
Much has been made of Island's lack of french fries--space and cost are cited on the menu--but an order of thick crispy salt and vinegar chips almost satisfies the craving
Island Recipe? The place was cramped, but that was expected from what I read
A good # of combinations on the menu and the milkshake was excellent - definitely shook off the summer heat
As for the burger, it was well presented but poorly cooked - very dry, crumbly
I had asked for medium so maybe that's how it's cooked on the island according to the cook, but it's time to get off this island
While the service isn't great the food makes up for it
I always bring friends when they're in town
EVERYONE loves the place
Among the best burgers in the city
Rest of menu is great as well
Salads are huge and delicious
Chicken Churrascos are large and tender
Fast delivery
Highly recommended
Island Burgers and Shake Shack have the best burgers in the city by far
Island serves a SERIOUSLY GREAT hamburger
I've had take out from there 4 times now since I first stopped by two weeks ago (always the people's choice burger) and it's been better than perfect each time
The service is attentive and friendly and the burgers are swoon worthy
I've always ordered medium rare and they come just as they should - fat, slightly charred on the outside and very pink and juicy at the center
A co-worker of mine has had a couple of burgers from Island ordered well done and thought they were TOO done, so you should probably keep that in mind
As for me, I've never had a better burger in NYC at any price
Excellent grilled chicken sandwiches and burgers with any topping you can think of
Huge portions - two of us ordered chips and guacamole (which was very good, sort of spicy) and were full by the time our sandwiches came
The sandwiches, however, are so so good
Great grilled chicken, huge burgers
The sesame buns are my favorite
Also, they have great milkshakes - very chocolatey and thick
Service may be a bit slow, but is friendly and laid back
The entire restaurant is relaxed and laid back
They play good music and have lots of magazines/newspapers to read
Its my new favorite place
The restaurant is small, but that didn't bother us too much
The service was friendly and their burger menu is extensive
However, being that they specialize in burgers, they should be able to cook it to the appropriate temperature
We ordered our burgers cooked medium, and even though the waitress warned us that it would be a very pink burger, they came out very well done
Don't know about restaurant orders, but our delivery orders (burger and salad) just arrived completely mushed up and with oil dripping down the bag, not very appetizing
Of course as always, the delivery boy was totally unfazed
Sigh, is there anyplace out there with customer service anymore?
The menu might make your nervous, but the food will make you grin
If you cannot decide what you want, try the bourbon street or the mona lisa (2 of my favorites)
The burgers are so big, its hard to stuff them into your mouth without watching them fall apart
Meat is top notch, toppings are one of a kind
Servers are layed back, but food arrives rapidly
Overall, there's something for everyone, including HUGE salads
While the Derrick's churasco is in my unesteemed opinion consistently brilliant, so too is the unwaveringly terrible service cramped quarters
There aren't more than 9 inches between the edges of the tables, which are teensy islands best shepherded with surgeon's precision
They tried to bring me my friend the caesar and sandwiches simultaneously last night; are u kidding?!? Where would they go?!? Fortunately the sandwiches weren't what we ordered; unfortunately the replacements took THIRTY solid minutes to arrive
They were busy; that's still not a valid excuse
Great food, awful service seating
Get it to go you'll not be disappointed, but not everyone lives close by
One of the best cheap eats in the city
Burgers are juicy and the salads are huge and superfresh
Friendly service and prompt seating, but a long wait for food
True enough, there is a huge selection of burgers to choose from
I made the mistake of ordering a burger on rye bread and the whole thing fell apart in my hands, it was a complete, messy joke
The accompanying toppings were pretty dismal (two tiny strips of bacon)
The burger itself was tiny, dry and flavorless, I had to pile on the salt and ketchup
I didn't like the lack of fries, either
If you're on a strict budget this place may be worth it, but I'm sure you can find better elsewhere
This place is a hidden gem ! I must have walked past it a million times before I actually gave it a look
The Burgers are amazeing ! They have a huge selection that woul dplease anyone
The shakes are great too, try a malted
I didn't even care that they didn't have frenchfries, I think they would have dtracted from how great my burger was
The atmosphere is kitschy california surfer relaxed i will definitely go bak !
I went there specifically because of all the reviews from people, but was highly disappointed
The shake was like soupy ice cream and it was WARM! The burger was unimpressive, the bacon overcooked and flavorless and the onions tasted bland
Staff was friendly and accomodating, but overall i was disappointed
No better burger in town
if only they had fries
This is so trite a thought, I resisted even thinking it for years but really, they need fries
DESPITE this, I almost weekly order a Hippo (pita, spicy sour-cream, onions, bacon and cheese) from among their MANY options for burgers
I couple it with a to-die-for chocolate shake
The variety of toppings at Island Burgers and Shakes is unmatched by any other place in the city
All the topping varieties that I've tried work really well and make for a unique burger every time
(try the Hippo Burger, mmmmmm
)  Many of the critiques of the place are true, but may be overly harsh due to the wrong expectations
True there are no french fries, definitely a minus, but once you accept it, you can get on with enjoying your burger
Another common critique about the beef is also true
If you are a burger purist, and just want a big juicy burger that's pink on the inside other places will have a better beef patty

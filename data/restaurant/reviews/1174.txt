I was a little concerned it would be super busy, but it was a perfect night to go
not packed, loud and crowded at all
We were able to sit in one of the private booths, which have curtains for privacy
The drinks were yummy and came with fun plastic animals
We started with the goat cheese fondue which was perfect and I had the tasty burger, which lived up to its name
The chocolate cake was pretty standard, but overall the food was great
The prices were extremely reasonable for the quality of the food
Overall, we had a really fun, relaxed low key evening
Skip the crowds, go Sunday night!
I went to this new hot spot on tuesday and was surprised by how great it was
My girl and I started with some tuna tartar and finish the meal with the best coconut cream pie ever!!!! The decor is great, funky and it just fits the LES
We ordered some drinks that where so good they even came with little animals (make sure you get a different one each time) My server rocked!! super cool girl and friendly
KC welcome to the LES!!!
After having visited Luna Park in LA, I was excited to try KC
The place was packed Friday night when I went with 3 others, and we were seated approx 10 -15 min after our scheduled reservation
This place is small - so be prepared to be cramped! Decor could definitely use a boost -- it was pretty plain
As for music - Gwen Stefani played on the stereo at first, which was outdated, but Hall Oats later on older Daft Punk made the atmosphere mesh much better
Food was great (especially the chicken, which was super flavorful) and not too expensive
I highly suggest starting with the goat cheese fondue -- delicious! But KC should make the apple slices thicker
they were almost nonexistant! Also don't forget to try the Dr
Pepper drink
I was totally geeked for this place, but was a little disappointed
Cocktails were mediocre at best
Seemed like they got something wrong with every drink order Bartenders were def
a little overwhelmed
Food was pretty good
Def get the lamb skewers if you go that way
Avoid downstairs
acoustics are awful, my date and I were literally yelling at each other
Even the waitress seemed annoyed by it
I love funky lounges with a strong ambiance but this was ridic
Service was excellent, v
friendly and cool, and the prices are v
reasonable
Maybe they were just having an off nite
I will try again
in a few months
This place looks so cozy, unique, and alive
The dark red ambience creates a very sexy room with a buzz, some funky art on the walls, a killer bar, and a super nice staff, (what a fresh surprise)! The food is unbelievably cheap, but you wouldn't know it from the food they serve
We had the raw tuna appetizer and a goat cheese fondue to start
Then we had roasted halibut and broccoli rabe, a mushroom stuffed pork cutlet, and a side of the best mac and cheese ever
We also found some room for the smore's dessert
The wine list was pretty good too, and not crazy overpriced
I can honestly say, that we left this place, happily stuffed, half drunk, and not broke
Best restaurant I've been to in awhile, not pretentious, super cool, and the food was sharp, simple and really, really tasty
Get a private booth!
My friends and I went there on a Sat
night and was told there was a 45 min
wait for a table
Yet people who arrived after us were seated before us
When we finally were seated (over an hour later), we were guided downstairs to an area of the restaurant that looks like a dungeon and was so cold, I had to put on my jacket
The waitstaff looked so confused
my friend and I actually got served things we didn't order
It then took another 25 minutes to get our actual orders
And when we did, they were cold! The place looks great but don't waste your money or time
What a pleasant and much anticipated surprise to see Kitchen and Cocktails open in NYC
I moved here almost 2 years ago from San Francisco where I absolutely LOVED Luna Park, their mother restaurant
I would tell all of my friends here about the marvelous mojitos, flank steak and, of course the sizzling smores for dessert!!! Now, I can enjoy that anytime on Orchard St
Woo hoo!!! Everyone MUST try it
It's amazing! What a cool vibe and awesome service
Go and trust me, you won't regret it!!!
The Scene The requisite wooden tables are filled with families, friends and dates, and the casual air and free tea refills encourage patrons to relax and stay awhile
Though some may find the atmosphere bland--a menu chalkboard is the only real decoration--this barbecue palace doesn't disappoint
The Food Barbecue pro Paul Kirk gives New Yorkers a taste for Midwest-influenced 'cue
His St
Louis-style ribs, meaty and firm but tender, taste deeply of hickory smoke, and the brisket satisfies with flavor
The pulled pork is almost too clean and benefits with a pairing of the addictive onion strings, while the heavily spiced sausage is tangy but forgettable
In contrast, the clever East Meets West duck, with a sweet-spicy glaze, triumphs, rivaling the ribs in appeal
Given the menu's range, it's too bad there's only one tomato-based sauce on the table
Sides offer hearty support, including a respectable potato salad and coleslaw
I've been to Dinosaur and would love to go back, but it is such a hassle to trek uptown
I also go to the Daisy May's stand on 6th, but sometimes I just want to sit and enjoy

is good BBQ and it's located right on 23rd and 7th
I had RUB take out at work and I thought it was very good, so I decided to go there with my wife (she loves BBQ) the other day
First off, I hate how they run out of stuff
However, I guess that is testament to the quality and taste of their stuff and is a good sign with respect to turnover and freshness
But I REALLY wanted fried-green tomatoes and the deep fried ribs - even after the waiter said they were out, I must have asked 3 more times as if I thought he was lying or had some hidden in the back
I settled on some standard ribs (pretty good), some onion fries (salty, light deliciousness), some hush puppies (nice with butter but even better when we brought the left-overs home and had them with our home-made maple butter)
I don't remember what my wife got, but I know she really enjoyed it
Overall, great BBQ but I'd make sure to get there early so that your favorite stuff isn't sold out
new york just doesnt know bbq
this is as close as it gets to real southern style bbq
food was amazing, service was great! the burnt ends are a must try
ill definately return again and again!
Paid $9 for a sandwich (delivery) and not a sandwich with 2 sides or something, that is JUST the sandwich, which was good, but not to die for
Like other users said, good food, but overblown
Unfortunately i was looking foward to RUN , but was let down
I guess i should have stuck with the ribs or pork butt- but i heard good things about the duck adn wanted to try it- what a mistaake unless tough tasteless meat is your thing
My friend had the pulled prok sandwiched -it was better than the duck but not the quality i was expecting for this place
Chicken tenders were ok - the usual
Dissapointing experience though i would go back to have the ribs or pork butt and give RUB the true test
It wasn't terrible, but I certainly wouldn't ever go back
The barbeque lacked flavor and kick
The collard greens were tasty, but in too much liquid that made it seem more like a soup
The only saving grace- those deep fried oreos
who would have ever thought?
thought i was getting some good ribs

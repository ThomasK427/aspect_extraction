A group of only three peolpe sitting next to our table complained because the restaurant had added a 25% gratituty to their bill while they got the lousiest service
The manager told them if you don't like the service don't ever come back! We couldn't beluieve our ears! We are taking the managers advice to the other group and will not be ever going back!
Close to closing, literally kicked guests who were still eating out
A customer left the front door open as they were leaving
Owner and waiters did not go close the door and it got really cold inside
The owner asked a customer who complained about the open door to go talk to the previous customer who had left the door open!!!!!  Another time, the owner got into a fight with a customer over a lukewarm rice dish
The owner claimed the dish was actually piping hot even when there was no visible steam coming out of it!!!!  I am done with this restuarant
Take your guest elsewhere
There are lots of other indian eateries in NYC
These are the best dosa (dosae?) I have ever had
The butter masala dosa is a great greasy treat, but everything I've had has been superb
On the other hand, unless you get the one nice waiter, be prepared for terrible service from glowering waitstaff
Look at it this way: the food makes up for it, and you get to save money on the tip
i am indian and a big fan of south indian food
the food at pongal is average, the rava masala dosa is much better at madras mahal (a few doors down) and certainly the service at pongal is the worst among the indian restaurants along that block
the waiters have a lot of attitude, are terribly rude about seating people and dont coordinate serving the food
its a miss, i go there if my other restaurants are full
Great Indian, perfect for Vegans and Vegetarians
Delicious for everyone, the food is fantastic
I heard good things about htis place so figured I'd give it a try
And it was awesome
Food was great
The place is a bit small and there can be quite a wait if you get there at a wrong time
So reserve in advance and def
go!!!
I was at Abigael's earlier this month, and while the food was good, it was really nothing to write home about
The service was good, the atmosphere was nice, but there was something lacking
I just love this place
The food is always good
They have several different types of steak
Each one is very tasty
The service is good
The atmosphere is very nice
Try it
Went to NYC for the weekend and looked up GF menus online - found Bistango and I am so glad we did
Went there for supper and loved it
The GF pasta is GREAT and it's so nice to be able to order and feel comfortable that you are getting GF food and not have to go through the speech
:) The ambience was so romantic and my husband really enjoyed his non-GF entree as well
The prices were very very reasonable for the location, ambience, taste, and service! I only wish they were located in my hometown! :) Our only negative comment is that my husband would have liked to been able to order a beer on tap, but there weren't any, and I would have loved to order a glass of Riesling wine instead of only by the bottle
Nothing special here
The food was very salty, the menu was very predicatable, and we even had to wait 30 minutes for a table for 4 on a Wednesday night
Been there a couple of times and the service and food were almost always fantastic
It is more stylish than your regular neighborhood restaurant but the service and atmosphere are still very much an old world style -- relaxing and unrushed
The owner is extremely pleasant and attentive
The food was above average, although the one dinner special I ordered was not very good
But the other items I have eaten there before were all very delicious
Great for dates and special occasions
I love eating at this restaurant
It seems that the people who go are all friendly with the staff and owner
Once you go they remember your face
Everyone always asks for the owner, and he often hooks them up with free things
He topped off our glasses of wine the last time we were there
On Valentine's Day they brought us chocolate liquor as a surprise
The staff is very friendly
the food is fantastic
the ambience is cozy for family or for a date
and the value is terrific
I went to Bistango with friends to celebrate a birthday, and we had the best time
The food was great, but not too pricey, and the atmosphere was perfect
All the amenities of upscale dining without the price
The staff was fantastic
attentive and friendly, but not overbearing
Definitely a place to try if you like italian food
:)
Nice intimate italian restaurant in Murray Hill
Bistango has the nicest staff and their pastas are to die for
The only thing I wouldn't order is the steak, but when you are in an Italian restaurant that doesn't limit much
Very inexpensive for the quality of food and service
very romantic with white tablecloths and candelight
also has music playing in the background
excellent start to the meal with thick and hearty homemade bread to dip into a small bowl of fresh garlic and olive oil
the linguini with seafood is very filling and tasty
the coup de grace is when the owner sometimes gives a complimentary drink at the end of the meal, which for my girlfriend and I was grand marnier
the apple crisp for dessert with chocolate and black raspberry ice cream was scrumptious
the service was excellent
definitely will go back again
In one word: Inconsistent
Service has ranged from adequate to extremely helpful
Sometimes the food is a crapshoot
I've been knocked off my chair by an appetizer, yet at the same meal spent 45 minutes trying to chew though the toughest steak I've ever encountered
Stick with the pastas and pizzas and you shouldn't be disappointed
But then again, you never know
i ordered take out on a slow sunday night and it took over an hour to get here (i only live 2 blocks away)
If I would have know it was going to take so long, I would have gone out and got it myself
Really sad
They showed up with no change, the wrong order and no bread
Thanks for nothing !!
La Giara has been a favorite of mine for a very long time
The food is always consistently good
The menu is such a nice blend of many different dishes, it is very hard to get bored, but the specials are also great! The cozy atmosphere and great staff provide an incredible atmosphere
Again, in a city with so many restaurants, this remains my favorite!!
This place is the best! The food is wonderful with some very unique options
Pair this will a quaint setting, great wine list, and helpful staff and this is by far one of the best options in this part of town
This place is totally amazing! Great food, awesome knowlegable staff,  LA GIARA is the best place to hang out with friends, drink some wine, and munch on the most creative combinations of food! the prices are surprisingly reasonable, the wine list is huge, (lots of friendly help deciding on which one from the staff), and the chef is adorable!
BEEN THERE A FEW TIMES, FOUND IT AN EXQUISITE LITTLE RESTAURANT
THEY HAVE SOME RARE ITALIAN RECIPES
NOT A LOT OF TOMATO RECIPES
THE WINE LIST IS COOL
A LOT OF WINES BOTTLE UNDER 30
Try the Short ribs in soffritto sauce, and a unique flourless almond chocolate cake

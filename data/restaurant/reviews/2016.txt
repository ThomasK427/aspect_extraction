If you're thinking about getting some pizza delivered in Tribeca, try these guys out
A good deep pie loaded with cheese and toppings
House salad was excellent too
The other day, myself and 2 colleagues decided to try Sal's Pizzeria on Broome St in Little Italy
We ordered a pie and two toppings (split in half)
What we got was an  undercooked, pizza with little or no toppings
To add insult to injury, when we complained that we were charged $4 for toppings that should have only been $2 (as advertised), the proprieter laughed and sarcastically commented that he shoud have charged even more
We were so amazed that we could be ripped off for a measly $2 more
An $11 pizza w/3 small cans of soda turned out to be a bill of $21
The pizza was bland at best
Avoid this place like the plague!
The desserts taste the same as anywhere else in the city (canoli n strawberry cheesecake)
The coffee
Now there's something to brag about
One of the finest
Many types-had the amartto
The service is great considering there was only one waitress
They make the best flavored coffees in New York City without a doubt
The cakes and pastries are the usual though, Italian-american style and NOT Italian quality
My wife and I went down to Little Italy to have dinner but before we went to dinner we went into this cafe thgat was crowed so we went inside to see what all the fuss was about
As soon as I saw thier dessert case we decide to skip dinner
I had thier trimisu and my wife warm apple pie with ice cream
I drank a double espresso(just like in Italy) and my wife had a vanilla capuccino
We stood in Sambuca's for about an hour and the wait staff realy friendly and fast
I've my new spot to just have coffee and relax
I not one to fuss over cafe's and restaraunts but the coffee's and desserts were so good that I had to share my experience
(by the way we did not have dinner we were stuffed after dessert)
I was passing by and this cafe looked fabulous
The wait staff was delightful, the tiramasu was to die for and as for the Cappuccino it was the best I have ever had, and it comes in variety of flavors such as almond, chocolate etc
I would recomend this cafe to anyone who is in Little Italy skip the dessert at the restaurant you just ate in and stop here for dessert with a friendly staff and fabulous coffees and of course cakes to die for!!! Dont pass it by definatly stop here for dessert!!!!!!!!!!!
The homemade tiramisu - absolutely delicious
Definitely going back there again soon
If you really enjoy Italian deserts and coffee I highly recommend Sambuca's Cafe
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried starbucks coffee before it became well-known and had thought great
Too bad I didn' think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabolous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and servive does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never dissapoint you
The Scene No place is the subject of as much debate among the pizza-eating public as John's, a downtown pizzeria that many celebrities and New Yorkers consider to be the city's best sauce-and-mozzarella-pie source
The family-friendly dining rooms feature wood booths and beat-up old tables, and lines form at peak hours
The Food The debate between camps is largely stylistic, centering on the distribution and amount of cheese on John's pies
Unlike other New York legends like Grimaldi's or Lombardi's, which sparingly distribute mozzarella in large squarish chunks, John's scatters pebble-sized pieces that form a single uninterrupted layer of cheese when cooked
Far less contentious are John's thin, charred crust, tasty fresh sauce and generous toppings
My husband and I happened to stumble into John's one afternoon while on vacation in NYC
We didn't even realize that it was so well regarded
We got the most intimate little booth in the middle of the afternoon and ordered Sam Adams, on tap
Yum
When the pizza came, we knew we would be there all afternoon
We spent three hours in John's! Wow
The pizza was over the top good and the service was great
We were never rushed out! I highly recommend this place, but if possible, come during the off hours
Expect to wait for a table, and bring an appetite
John's sells pies only
Seating is at well-worn rows of tables, some carved with previous diner's initials and names
But the pie that's delivered steaming hot and crusty is out of this world
A N'Yawk classic!
Pizza at John's was nothing special
All of my family love pizza and everyone agreed with me
I don't know why this place has such a following
This is great pizza -- nothing fabulous or particularly original, but satisfying, even mouthwatering slices and a pretty cool joint to boot make this place one that I would definitely return to again and again
Besides, with all the average and below average pizza you can find in NYC, it's nice to have a good place to go to hang out, have a slice and a beer with some friends and actually enjoy what you eat
I've tried different pizza places coast to coast, and John's on Bleeker is undoubtedly the best pizza I have ever eaten
The seating area is crammed and dim, and the staff are not very personal, all of which make it an authentic NYC pizzaria
The white pizza was amazing, and the pepperoni on our other pizza was fantastic
The crust was perfectly crispy and chewy with a subtle charred taste
The cheese was fresh and flavorful, unlike the rubbery and slimy cheese found on most pizzas
My friends and I are still awaiting our next trip to NYC to go there again
After several trips to Italy and after years of eating my Nona's pizza I can honestly say that this is truely the best pizza I have had outside of Italy
Very authentic true Italian Pizza, with the best ingreedants
Fortunatly it is just a few blocks away from my house, because they don't deliver
When I have out of town guests I always take them here, and they always want to go back for more
Simply the best!
Whoever wrote that this pizza is a good pizza, he/she has never been in Italy and knows anything about pizza
Pizza you find in New York City is far from being even close to the real one, especially the one you find in here
Is that so difficult to find a good pizza abroad? OF COURSE IT IS!!! Pizza is an Italian culture matter
its ingredients come directly from Italy's earth
basil, tomato, mozzarella, and all the other ingredients are rich, natural, tasty
Those products taste thousands and thousand times different than local products I mean, after all these years spent through those enormous dead pizza slices you find everywhere around town, when you go to Italy just buy a slice anywhere you are and you'll see the difference
at least you'll taste it
I went to this place twice
the first time, the pizza was so tastey b/c we asked for garlic on the pizza
went the second time and was disappointed in how bland the pizza was without the garlic
the service is very friendly and fast but the pizza is average and bland without the garlic
Every one of our Eat Clubbers said GREAT PIZZA! Maybe the best in Manhattan
We finished two large ones between the 6 of us
The staff was friendly and accommodating
We were all afraid to try the Pumpkin Beer, but other than that, we got THE WORKS
No reservations, so you have to wait on line
bring a book
It's worth it! -- Eat Club is a Monthly NYC group of roving gluttons
Not tasty at all

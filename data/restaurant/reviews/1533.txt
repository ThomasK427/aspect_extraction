Get the Bibimbop if you feel like soup and all fixin's
There's not lots of room when it's time to dine but so will your stomach anyway after a meal here
A very cheap and tasty dish which goes well anytime
Their kkaktookee is delicious--spicy yet sweet
the kimchi is EXCELLENT!! the best i've ever had
the service is fast and food is delicious at reasonable prices
the Sullung Tang is delicious
residents and visitors to new york both frequent this place
definitely worth eating here
This place has serves excellent Korean dishes frequented by local visiting Koreans
It is recommended by many for its quality of food, and trueness to Korean cuisine

I had a really bad experience from the Mafioso type Manager who set me, to the Jersey clientele, to really bad food
I had calamari, which were not crisp and limp, and sweet breads gave me really bad indigestion
On top of it all thy wouldn't honor my restaurant certificate
WILL NEVER GO BACK and wouldn't recommend it even to an enemy
We were pleased with the location of this restaurant as we thought that it would be perfect for a pre-MSG event meal
We had high hopes for this very nice looking restaurant with a reasonable menu
However, the service was SO BAD that it was almost funny
We had to ask several times for bread and for water and we waited a SOLID HOUR for our pasta, despite asking the waiter, the busboy, or anyone else we could find who assured us that our food was coming right out
The entire wait staff seemed to be flustered as people in very tables surrounding ours walked out one by one as they complained about the service
THe place is very nice and very romantic
Also good for large groups
the tables are well spaced
the place wasnt crowded at all and we were not rushed to leave
the service was perfect
couldnt ask for anything better
the food was well prepared as well and very inexpensive for the atmosphere!
We called to see about the wait the person who answered said no wait come down now
We waited for 10 minutes, not terrible but the place 60% empty
The waiter comes over for drink order we refused he leaves, never bothering to tell us the specials, we had to ask another waiter
The soup arrived and the waiter asked if I wanted cheese pepper - I never got the pepper
The table next to us got the wrong check ran his credit card with it
Ordered dessert another waiter hovers by us with checks
We did not ask for the check but told him what we ate hope he would find the right check
After saying what we ordered 5 times he scratch off the check and put what we ate
Payment made on credit the hostess brought the receipt without the card
What a wonderful spot
We fell into Tango Tuesday night lessons
We eschewed the lessons at $30 a pop and sat aside the dance floor to watch with glee the beginners to experts dancing the Tango
Everybody at the table got aroused just watching
Great shoes
Great outfit
But the best part for us was the food
All of it tasty and not cliched
We easily will go back many times
Friendly service and the bar allows smoking far enough from the tables and the room is airy not stuffy
They make the sausage in-house and you can tell--not just from the flavor, which is exquisite, but from the bouquet of spice scent that hits you in the snoot when you go under the kitchen to visit the necessary
The rest of the food is commensurately good, and the price is definitely right
The decor is, as others have noted, a bit Early Christmas Light; but it's got a certain goofy charm, at that
This is the perfect place to go before any concert or game at MSG
I went their last week before a show and had no problem getting out on time
The staff is very accomodating and the food was great
You should definetly try the pastas
the sausage is a must and everthing is reasonably priced
Decent wine list
If your looking for a 4star place, this is not for you, but overall a great place for a quick bite! I'll be back!
This restaurant, while close to the Magnet, Pit and UCB theaters, was absolutely terrible
Serice was well below average, not only did they not refill our water glasses but when every dish on the table was pretty much untouched, the waitress didn't say anything or even ask if everything was okay
I had the cheese and spinach stuffed mannicotti - there was little to no sauce but plenty of water - not good
Stick to the bar/pubs in this area and steer clear of Biricchino
Also terribly over priced for the area and the food
The decor may not be the greatest but the food is delicious, the staff is friendly and you get a great meal for the money
This is a great spot for pre Theatre goers
The place had okay red sauce food, and the waitstaff was friendly
They never refilled our water glasses
It might be the best sit down food I've had in the area, so if you are going to the upright citizen brigade, or the garden, it could be just the place for you
Biricchino is absolutely amazing! The fresh, homemade sausages are the best
my favorite is the chicken apple
The pastas are incredibly rich and decadent
Even though you'll want to sample a little bit of everything off the menu -- and I recommend that you do -- make sure you keep Biricchino in mind any time you're in Manhattan!
Great sausages, decent pastas, cheap
Given how little else there is in the Penn Station/MSG area, this is a nice find
Decor is sort of early-diner, but if you can forgive that, this is worth the trip
l
A great place to go before a night on the town
The decor looks like a dinner but the food is just wonderful
do not think twice about not ordering the pasta dishes, all choices are just so tasty
great prices!!
In the land of Korea town, AWESOME Chinese food, with great value (perfect portions)
Service was quick, and you can tell that all the locals love this place, and fill it everynight
Decor is your normal family restaurant, not a hole in the wall chinese decor
Villa has it all
Good atmoshpere, good food, good people and good drinks
It was the perfect way to kick back and avoid the hectic commute after work
I went on a Thursday with a few people from my work and the dj was mixing the perfect blend of latin, dance and the occassional song you just love to hear
The crowd was good looking and upbeat
I think I definitely found my afterwork spot
Used to work just around the corner from Dano and have found it to be consistently good
excellent and varied menu that is suitable for lunch and dinner, comfortable and rather romantic tables
the BEST goat cheese tart in the city
excellent attentive service and great value
i will continue to go back often
Great Time, Great Tunes, and Greatest of all was the Tuna
My mouth is still watering
I think I need another Margarita, but which flavor? I couldn't decide which was better the Pomegranite or the regular
I laughed with the staff who did a great job, and added more flavor to the place
Will come back again and again
Just moved into the area, decided to try it
The staff was very unfriendly and was doing me a favor by waiting on me

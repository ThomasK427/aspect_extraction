for that meal was ridiculous
They charge for coffee and bottled water in addition to the high prix fix
We have eaten in many Manhattan restaurants that are superior to Gramercy Tavern, and have never complained about the cost
A delicious meal is worth it
Avoid this restaurant! It is not worth what they charge
My boyfriend took me to Gramercy for our anniversary and I have to say, the place was amazing
The host gave us a prime time reservation when he found out it was our anniversary and we walked into a great table and champagne, compliments of the house
Our server could not have been friendlier or more professional and the food--wow
A three course meal winds up a six course meal with all of the extras they bring you
I walked out full, content and feeling like a million dollars
It was nice to splurge (and splurge, you will with dinner coming in at well over 200
00) but once in a while it's nice to eat and be treated like royalty
The food here is impeccable
You simply cannot go wrong
Believe the hype ;)
The front dining room is nice and worth it if you can get a table
We managed to get a table in the back dining room and were treated to an incredibly over-priced, under-sized meal
The filet mignon couldn't have been much more than 1 ounce of meat - truly a ridiculous size portion
Quality was average, and given the price, I would never eat in the formal dining room again
We were very excited to dine at one of the highest rated restaurants
Appetizers were excellent and prepared beautifully
Unfortunately, that was the best aspect of the dining experience
We were seated in the main dining section as opposed to the tavern area
The server was condescending and was unable to provide assistance with menu selections
Our entrees included the halibut, salmon, and lamb
All were very average compared to other restaurants within this price range and food quality
It is always difficult to secure reservations at Grammercy and after our experience, I would suggest making reservations elsewhere
There are far too many restaurants in New York city that offer exquisite food, ambience, and friendly service
Grammercy Tavern was not one of those restaurants
If you are looking for a true dining experience, look past Grammercy
it is one of the most overrated restaurants in the city
Very disapointed
I just moved into the neighborhood and wanted to have a nice dinner to celebrate, so I went here
It was so great I ended up coming back within a week
The service was superb, food was amazing
The ambience is perfect
My first meal was a romantic dinner with my boyfriend, and the second was with my boss and his wife
This place was perfect for both occoasions
Highly recommended
my boyfriend i came here last winter for their tasting menu ($95pp) which is about 7 courses
the place doesnt disappoint! the service is excellent (like all the danny meyer restaurants) when i told them that i dont eat lamb, they offered me any choice from the menu as a substitution
i chose the steak (medium rare, as good as any steakhouse) my bf had the lamb (which he said was good)
the other dishes were small but well-presented/flavoured (i dont remember everything we ate but i do remember an excellent white fish in a lemony broth)
after reading reviews that raved about their cheeses, we asked for a cheese plate before our dessert course
the waiter helpfully recommended 6 different cheeses ranging from mild to strong
desserts are satisfying but not amazing
the tasting menu changes seasonally
the regular prix fixe menu is about $76pp
My fiance and I went to Gramercy Tavern for Valentine's Day
While I favor the food at Craft, the overall experience at Gramercy was amazing
The food was good (small portions) but the service and the ambiance/vibe/atmosphere was electric
You could tell everyone wanted to be there
I guess we were a couple of the lucky ones
I went with my husband and we both thoroughly enjoyed our experience there
I made the reservation ahead of time, so getting in and being seated was not an issue
It does get crowded and noisy in the front, so we found it nicer to be seated towards the back of the restaurant
We really had a wonderful time and can't wait to go back
It is bit on the pricey side, but I thought every penny was worth it
Isn't it what a NYC restaurant experience suppose to be? (NYC restaurant experience not necessarily being expensive always, but walking out after dining knowing it was just perfect)
We were a group of 4 and we made reservations a month in advance
I had always wanted to try Gramercy Tavern
As a native NYer it was one of the few nice restaurants I had somehow not made it to
At any rate, the waiter totally forgot about us and we had to hail him down a couple of times just to get the specials and to order
They totally forgot to bring us our coffee altogether and we told them to foget it finally after we had eaten our dessert and it still hadn't arrived
Not that it would have come anyway
They weren't the least bit apologetic
It was a mediocre experience and not worth the hype or the price
We were all disappointed
My boyfriend I came for dinner during Christmas weekend and were NOT disappointed! After being seated, we enjoyed our surroundings while the waiter inquired if we would like to see the menus or wait
we were not rushed at all
We decided on the tasting menus while adding a dish which included white truffles
Every dish was perfection
our white truffle dish which was served over a poached egg fettucine noodles
Our meal, wine Dessert dishes were divine
At the end of our meal, we ordered Chocolate Martinis which were warm and the best I've ever had
We also were offered muffins to take home
the whole meal was exceptional
During our meal, my boyfriend dropped his knife on the floor
before we could say anything, one waiter picked it up while another brought a knife to our table on a platter
If you eat here, you will not be disappointed!
I was blown away by my Gramercy Tavern experience
My boyfriend and I ate in the Tavern Room and found the food to be simply divine (I recommend the portobello tart and filet)
Their service is also unmatched
Our waiter, Frank, was attentive, friendly, and went out of his way to make us feel welcome
Overall, I had a fantastic experience and will definitely dine there again
I've been to Gramercy Tavern at least 10 times in the past three years
Everytime we go there, the memory of my previous visit raises my expectations to new highs, and everytime Gramercy Tavern delivers
I've yet to be disappointed
Impeccable service, great menus, great setting, what else can I add? I fail to understand those people who call it 'overrated'
This place is among the greats in New York, which means it is among the best restaurants in the world
Sure, it is expensive, but the price/value relationship is really good
If you're a true foodie who'd like to dine at one of NY's best without the customary 4-week advance reservation -- make a habit of tucking into Gramercy's  no-reservations 'Tavern Room' whenever the mood strikes
Get there between 6 and 7:15PM if you can, and be prepared to wait amiably at the beautiful bar
Over time, cultivate a relationship with a few of the amazing Tavern staffers (if you don't know where to begin, feel free to seek out our favorite
a blonde bar-server named Destin)
No matter how jammed oversubscribed Gramercy can get, somehow YOU'LL be treated as a valued regular
every time
We don't even WANT to be seated in the main dining room anymore!
Waiting an hour for a table was definitely not worth the wait
Not only was the food bland, all the meals were cold and boring

Can't wait to go back!
I have eaten at Meridiana at least five times and I always leave satisfied
The decor is simple and elegant
The staff is attentive but not overbearing
And the food is always fresh and consistent
The pasta's are fresh and (I believe) handmade and the sauces are well-seasoned
Italian food need not be complex, but when well-made, is absolute perfection
The wine list is reasonable, and I love a place with an affordable Amarone!!
In Short The tiny interior rests upon the well-worn wood floors of a small storefront
Tables are small and tightly spaced, with green faux-granite tops
Count on fresh, fairly priced cuts of fish that represent a good value, even if portions are a bit on the small side
Miso soup and small salads are presented in charming wooden bowls, while steaming-hot sake arrives in an attractive ceramic pouring vessel
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else
I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant
It's boring on the inside, and our sushi was pretty below average
the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor
I definitely wouldn't go back
Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit
Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated
while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing
No thanks!!!
Miyagi is my sushi restaurant of choice in the Village; it's never insanely crowded, the service is very sweet (I've never experienced any of the nastiness described in prior reviews), and the tabs are small
Unfortunately, so are the pieces of sashimi and sushi, sometimes; on the other hand, it's all delicious and fresh, and you won't leave stuffed
I've yet to have a bad or indifferent meal here; nothing will knock your socks off, but you're guaranteed a good, swimmingly fresh time
Had dinner here on a Friday and the food was great
You're going to drop some coin, but completely worth it, especially if you are looking to impress someone
After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs
Talk about a perfect date transition
Grotta Azzurra was absolutely fabulous! Delicious Italian food, a wonderful ambiance, impeccable service and an overall great dining experience
The decor is classy and elegant
oustanding wine list which our server knew in and out
and be sure to save room for their amazing desserts
Highly Recommended!!
I went to this place several years ago and it was amazing
It seems to be under different ownership
The fish noodle soup and baby ginger salad were really good, but the fried appetizers were greasy, the formerly hot, spicy and unique beef kabot and chicken curry were totally bland
The beef was so tough that we couldn't chew half of it
The thousand layer pancake was burnt and leaden
The service was appaulingly bad, considering that there were only two couples in the restaurant and we were seated right next to each other
The time from seating to getting an order taken was 30 minutes
THE PHO IS AVERAGE, BUT IT IS A CLOSER WALK THAN CHINATOWN FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK IN TRIBECA
THE SERVICE FROM THE WAITERS IS POOR! AND SOMETIMES JUST RUDE
THIS PLACE IS GOOD WHEN IT IS RAINING AND YOU CAN'T WALK TO CHINATOWN
FOR BETTER SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD TRY THAISON ON BAXTER ST IN CHINATOWN INSTEAD
We went there on a Saturday night, and was seated promptly
The service was very friendly and the food was even better
Definitely try the Chicken Sate as appetizer especially since it comes with an incredible tasting peanut sauce
The proportions for all the dishes were generous
The place is also nicely decorated, and a large party should be able to fit in nicely since the place is pretty spacious
The only con this place has is that its a little bit out of the way
But if you are working/living in TriBeCa, definitely check this place out
And for people who don't live in TriBeCa, I would definitely recommend you visit this place on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon
After the meal, you can always walk a little southwest to the beautiful Nelson Rockefeller Park on the Hudson and play some frisbee or touch football
This place WAS one of my favorite places to have parties and take friends
THEN
They rennovated and turned into something terrible
Don't listen to any of the other reviews before 2006 because they are all talking about something that does not exist
They USED to have large portions,reasonable prices, friendly waitstaff, fun vybe and strong drinks
NOW they are just another slick wanna be hip, cold,unfriendly, ultra modern, small portioned, leaving you hungry, weak drinked, dissapointment
THEY KILLED DAY-O!!! the cool swaying palm tree and fun ethnic artwork has been replaced with flat pannel televisions!!! DISCRACEFUL! And a cold white bright very modern feeling
They used to have a romantic vibe
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BIG DELICIOUS PORTIONS? The Drinks tasted WATERED DOWN!!  All of the good places are gone
Now the good places are turning into something they are not
This used to be a very good restaurant
Maybe last night was an off night but my friend I waited to be seated by a very rude hostess on 06/06/05 until she was done flirting with a group of men seated at a table near the bar
After seating us down she did not return to the table
No water, no bread, no drinks, nothing
There were a total of 5 tables with customers
Eventually, we left and had a nice meal elsewhere
PS: The music was so loud you could hardly hear the person next to you
What happened? This was not the same hostess I usually see there who happens to be very sweet and provides excellent service
I am a New Yorker, but this spot was not known to me
The decor is real funky
You will find a palm trees made of out coffee and tomato cans which I thought was quite innovative and creative
Our waitress (who is Jamaican) was phenomenal!! The rum punches were not made with cheap rum, and were great! No one in my group had a complaint
I had the opportunity to meet the upper management, and the owner's family is from Jamaica, as I am too
I think that Day-O captures and accentuates their food so that everyone will love it
The presentation is incredible! The food touches all specialties of the islands and not just Jamaica
Trust me, you should go and try it out yourself
You will see that it is well worth your time and it will quickly become a well frequented favorite- as it has mine!
Lovely relaxing place, staff chilled out, and the jerk pork was a memorable and tasty main course
Washed down with a couple of Red Stripes and good company, it was a great way to spend an evening
I'm not a big fan of the decor (looks to me like a bunch of African themed wooden earrings blown up and hung on the walls), but I'm a HUGE fan of the food
The crab cakes, rice and beans, samler platter, and salmon have all met with my approval so far
We've walked in without reservations each time and always been seated fairly quickly
Servers are pleasant and portions are large
The place has its own unique decor
The bartenders and staff are really accomodating and pleasant
You will not go wrong with the drinks
They are smooth but strong and well prepared
The cuisine is just mouth-watering
I have been there a few times and recommended it highly
Try to make reservations, because the place is always packed
Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery
I've waited over one hour for food
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice

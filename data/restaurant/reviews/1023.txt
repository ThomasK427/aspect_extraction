I was very excited for this bakery to open only to be disappointed
Let me begin by saying I love cupcakes
But Crumbs is going for size over taste
The jumbo cupcakes are very dry, as are the brownies and muffins
I'd rather have two small moist cupcakes than a large dehydrated one, but even the mini ones here look better than they taste
I live very close to the LG, the food is great
The masamama curry is fabulous and the calamari is another favorite
The food is inexpensive, drinks very strong and the service is great
I have been there a dozen times and have ordered out twice
The karoke is pretty bad, EXCEPT when the college kids next door at the new school dorms sing, and unlike the 'suits' they have talent!
I used to be a regular at the Lemongrass, both in the restaurant and take-out and their food is consistantly very good
The chefs are very accommodating when altering spiciness, etc
However, the past two times I ordered food from there, some foreign objects had found their way into my food
Instead of replacing the dish or a refund, they offered to give me a free portion on my next take-out order
Four weeks later, after gave the Lemongrass enough time to change their ways, I called up for my free portions, and they wouldn't give them to me
They've lost my business entirely
Also, request a table AWAY from the kitchen entrance
frontal views into their nasty kitchen won't help your appetite
And if you see people singing karaoke at the bar through the window, keep walking! They have the songs on so loud there's no chance for a conversation
went there for dinner
the seafood pasta special is amazing, portions were very generous
the staff was so friendly and attentive
the price is reasonable
went there for brunch and again the food was delicious
highly recommend the blueberry pancakes and i'm not a big pancake fan
i really love this restaurant
highy recommended!!
My fiance and I have been to Primitivo 4 times now - we first gave it a try thanks to Citysearch and we keep coming back, and sending our friends
The food is terrific, the waitstaff are competent, the atmosphere is just slightly upscale/trendy, and the prices are amazing!
Went there on Saturday night
I had reservations and was seated as soon as we walked in
The website showed tablecloths on tables
There were no tablecloths
Tablecloths give a restaurant more ambience, so I was disappointed
Previous reviews stated that this was a romantic place
I found it to be very loud, so you have to raise your voice to hear
The waiter was very attentive, knew how the food was prepared and knew about the wines
The food came out quickly
Ordered the sirloin steak medium-well and it came out medium-rare
I ordered the fish special, which was striped bass in a light tomato sauce
The presentation for both dishes were just okay
The fish was fine
I think the prices were very reasonable
If you're looking for decent food at decent prices you won't be disappointed
This is a good place if you have a small party
There are not enough kind words for Primitivo - the food is fantastic, the waitstaff wonderful and the owner is very friendly
My boyfriend and I have tried many places in the surrounding area and none can come close to the excellent food for the price
The fish dishes and salmon are among the best I have ever tasted, as always the pasta entrees are just wonderful - having tried almost the entire menu! A very enjoyable dining experience for a special occasion or a Tuesday night dinner
After reading many posotive reviews, I was excited to try this place
But I left wondering what everyone was raving about
I will say the service, ambiance and dessert were really good
But my cavitelli bolognese was just ok and the sauce tasted like it was from a can
Our starter salad was average and the focaccia bread had no taste
My wine was fine - no complaints there
But nothing blew me away or kept me wanting to come back
I think they are missing the mark on italian food
I went there a few days ago for my anniversary
It was good
The deserts suck, but the lobster which was only 26 bucks, was OH SO worth it
I got ravioli stuffed with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes in vodka sauce
I wouldve loved it for them to put more ravioli
i only had 4 on my plate, but the sauce is amazing
Too bad the dishes don't come with salad and garlic bread
Overall, it was good,
Recommended by some friends, we went to Primitivo on a Thursday night to have some Italian food
Immediately, we were pleased with how good the service was, attentive but not overbearing
We each started with a salad, I had a delicious Caesar and my wife had arugala with a house dressing
very tasty
For dinner, one of us had chicken parm and the other a veal scaloppine style dish
They were both delicious and the prices were very reasonable, especially for New York
We split a chocolate torte for dessert and we were on our way to the movies
All in all, a very good dining experience
After a long day I took my girlfriend to Primitivo Saturday night around 10ish
We were seated promptly as 1/3 of the tables were empty
Anticipating a late night rush that never materialized we were jammed up against another couple, wedged behind a large loud party
Our waiter could barely make himself heard over the noise
He took our orders and that was the last we saw of him, never once did anyone ask us if we needed anything and no one got us more water
Toward the end of our meal our waiter only reappeared to Windex the tables next to us
It never occurred to him that we might not enjoy the ammonia smell
Luckily the food was great, and the wine was nice
Otherwise the entire experience might have been thoroughly unpleasant rather than just annoying
I have passed this restaurant many times, but never went in because it looked expensive
Luckily, the lunch sign caught my eye last week
I felt so welcomed as soon as I entered the restaurant
I was amazed at the selections offered at these reasonable prices
The salad was generous and so delicious; my entree was excellent
I felt like I was out to dinner, not lunch
And the service could not have been better
Diego, my server, came and introduced himself and made me feel like an old friend
He said that serving me was a pleasure and welcomed me back at any time
He acted more like a restaurant owner (and maybe he is) than a restaurant worker
I will be making Primitivo a regular on my list of fine restaurants
Diego, thank you for the wonderful dining experience
We were wandering down 14th st
one Sunday after noon and after walking in and out of a few places found this one
They were so nice and down to earth we felt comfortable immediately
The wine was better than most and the food was perfect
It's difficult to achieve a relaxed atmosphere in a NYC rrestaurant but they did it that day
I just celebrated a birthday on 9/03 at the Primitivo Osteria and I have to say that I had the best time ever at this restaurant
The staff was very accommodating and they made sure that all our needs were met

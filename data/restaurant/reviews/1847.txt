Dave (the restaurant manager) is a godsend to the dining industry
Thanks Dave!
I have probably eaten at Blue Ribbon more than 50 times over the past five years, and each time it is like dining at a friend's place
The staff is excellent and the menu is diverse
You can eat there over and over without getting bored
Definitely try the beef marrow and oxtail marmalade appetizer (you can just ask for an order of bones)
The wine list is good, without being over-the-top and the oysters are always superb
Put your name on the waiting list and hang out at a nearby bar if it is crowded
The retaurant is know for the long wait but they do take reservation for group of 5-8 people, so it was just perfect for my friend BD dinner for 3 couples
The food was good for the price, and service was just excellent
One of the guest, (not a waiter) spilled water and it spllashed down to our table
Manager came immdeiately to applogize
When check came, we then found out deserts were on house for applogy and celebrate my friend's BD
Popular restaurant usually get very snabby, but blue ribbon still maintaines friendly and hospitality oriented atomospher
The food was brilliant, we had a wonderful waiter! It was the most perfect night!
I've been going to Blue Ribbon for a couple of years and not once have I been disappointed
The food is awesome along with the service and I have been to many so called great restaurants in the city and Blue Ribbon has that rare combination of good food,great music and good looking people
Even the owner's involved with the customer's which is rare
Where else can you get fresh lobster at three in the morning
I wandered in here one wednesday night at about midnight and was suprised to see how crowded the place was
i sat at the bar and had a beer while watching Alonso working his magic at the raw bar I ordered half a dozen little necks,which were spectacular,so I finished those and ordered another half ,then progressed onto a bacon cheeseburger and another beer all the time watching the man at work -he was chatting with everybody in the place while he was busy at work
I have heard it gets very crowded so I would recommend going very late
btw the burger was damn good too
i've never been to Blue Ribbon before 12AM and the food and the service is always fantastic
excellent seafood and great cosmopolitans!
i have been going since 1993 and this hasd always been my favorite restaurant
very consistent, and very good
there is a long wait between 7pm and 11pm most nights, (no reservations unless you are 5 or more), but the food is worth the wait
I have never had a bad meal at Blue Ribbon
Their seafood, graciously shucked by Alonso is as fresh as can be with Plateaus of Fresh Crab, East and West Coast Oysters, Clams and Jumbo Shrimp
The appetizer you shouldn't miss is foie gras served with slivers of bosc pear and crunch brioche
The ribs are a second runner up, poo poo platters are never out of style
James is the favorite at the bar, always accomodating and if you are lucky Kyle will be your server
This place wins hands down
only down side is you will wait for dinner
and wait
and wait
It never ceases to amaze me how busy and popular Blue Ribbon is, even after all these years
It's no wonder, when they provide great food, good service and a fun and lively atmosphere
I've never had one bad thing on the menu
It's best to make reservations, the place is always busy
Plus, think twice about inviting a very large group here (six or more), it's a small space and fills up quickly
The Scene Since it flung open its floor-to-ceiling windows in 1996, this sophisticated corner seafood spot has been one of Soho's quintessential neighborhood restaurants
Its pillow-strewn lounge is perpetually packed with unwinding professionals; the long bar manned by oyster shuckers and friendly bartenders; and the elegant (though clamorous) dining room, managed by a smart set of attentive servers
The Food When it comes to inventive seafood and stellar oysters, this international and surprisingly affordable menu is one of the city's most popular
Signatures like falafel-crusted salmon and sweet stone crab claws with jicama-jalapeno slaw are buoyed by seasonally changing dishes
Start with meaty, flash-fried soft-shell crab simply paired with citrus vinaigrette, or super-fresh raw sea bass wrapped around wasabi-slathered avocado
For entree fish, pick your own roasted or grilled, or rest assured in creative compositions, like rich John Dory offset with sweet-corn risotto
The house-made chocolate truffles are an ideal denouement
Showed up last Sunday night with girlfriends and no reservation, host was very helpful finding us a seats at bar after short wait
The bartenders were helpful, friendly and cute, atmosphere was fast paced yet comfortable, and to top it all off, the food was some of the best ever
amazing!!! I ordered off ala cart menu, which is a nice option, but specials were fantastic and perfectly prepared as well
Don't Miss!!
Went here on a Friday night
Did not have reservation, but the two of us were seated right away at 9:30
Cocktails are served in two sizes regular and modern; modern being served in oversized martini glass and are perfectly prepared
Waiter was knowledgable and friendly
He explained the different varieties of oysters (they have over 20) and put together an assortment for me based on my taste
We also had the lobster salad for an appetizer which was expensive ($23) but contained lots of lobster meat and a multitude of flavors (chunks of avacado, citrus)
For entrees we had the seared diver scallops w/ a crabmeat risotto (highly recommend) and the Yellowfin Tuna which was also great
Did not have dessert, but they had several selections that sounded enticing
Overall a great place if you are willing to spend the money
Went with my family to celebrate my sister's graduation, and was never seated
We watched for over an hour as parties our size, without reservations, were seated before us
Incredibly insulting
I'e never seen anything like it, and I'll never go back there
I need to express to everyone who might read this review how wonderfully consistent the quality of seafood at Aquagrill has been since I first ate there in 1998
I have never had anything less than a superlative meal on any of my visits to this restaurant over the past seven years
I've encouraged numerous friends and co-workers to visit the restaurant over the years; not one person who appreciates seafood has ever had anything less than glowing words for the food
our quartet came here for sunday brunch
my friend specifically wanted to try their oysters, and was pleased to see over 20 varieties listed
we tried 3 different kinds of oysters per the waiters helpful recommendations
the oysters (ranging from $2
50 - $2
85) were fresh and briny
we each ordered various seafood-themed brunch entres as well
my friend i had rare grilled yellowfin tuna sandwiches served with salad ($12)
the tuna came slightly seared and there were no burnt edges to mask the freshness of the fish
one of my friends had the crab benedict ($16) the poached eggs came nested on seasoned slivered crab very tasty
another friend had their daily special hectors omelette a dense crab, asparagus, and cheese-stuffed omelette (very filling)
entres were preceded by a basket filled with warm miniature scones muffins
i want to come here again for dinner!
I adore this place
I've never been there and had less than amazing food
The oyster selection is great, and the entrees are delicious
And by delicious I mean, wake up days later savoring the flavors delicious
It's exactly the type of high end cuisine without going over the top that makes this place a must
Not to mention that the service ranges from very good to excellent
I've never met anyone who wasnt a huge fan, and frankly it's better than other, more expensive, seafood places in the city
I'm not one to highly recommend places, but this place is worth every penny (and that's a lot of pennies)
People must give this restaurant high ratings because they think they're supposed to
I was extremely disappointed
I ordered grilled pompano (one of my favorite fish), but it was overcooked and flabby, and tasted like it had been sitting around under heat lamps for a while
The sides were also overcooked and had a distinct reheated quality
It certainly wasn't what I expected from the second most highly rated NY seafood restaurant in Zagats
Add to that very questionable service - I was with a large party, but the staff was extremely inattentive
Our server came by to tell us the specials then disappeared
After 20 minutes we had to ask to have someone come back and take our order
We even had to ask for fresh pepper! In an establishment that claims to be of the level of quality that Aquagrill does, that's just inexcusable
food? A+ service and friendliness? A+  was planning a party for my staff, and was treated rudely by another restaurant when trying to add more people to reservation (a simple no would have worked)

This is our top choice for eating in the neighborhood for value and overall dining experience
if you are ever in the area - definitely go for this place
we were looking to eat somewhere before a concert at Smoke on Tuesday night when we found this little bistro-type french outfit
have absolutely nothing negative to say - the service was friendly and quick (although our waiter stumbled on specials and had to repeat them again); the prices are very-very reasonable (the most expensive main course on the menu - $22); good selection of wines (including some excellent inexpensive choices); and the food was
Ogh
beyond good
Honestly, i don't remember the last time I had such a great dinner at a french restaurant
In short, - go for it, - you won't be disappointed
Alouette is the type of restaurant New York needs more of
The food is very good
Some of it is standard bistro fare well executed
However, the chef is not afraid go beyond the standard items and demonstrate his creativity
On top of that add the very nice people own the restaurant and you have a winning combination
Some of the other reviews have mentioned attitude from the servers
I certainly have never had that experience
I've introduced several friends to this restaurant and they all seem to be quite fond of it as well
Highly recommended
If only there were more quality restaurants like Alouette on the Upper West Side
I've eaten there several times and never had a bad meal, or bad service
I highly recommend it
This place has the best food! Awesome Kebabs! Incredible pumpkin and eggplant
You can't go wrong
It doesn't matter if the food is good, the service great; whatever
The food delivery order never came
And when I called back, they said they never got an order
You can mess up on delivery orders anywhere else, but in this city, there's almost no greater sin
i went to this place for dinner
they have great value meals
chicken tandoori tasted ok
Coconut soup was a dream come true
If you select a meal, a variety of food is offered
service a little slow
Had doubts on the cleanliness
While the food may arrive within 20 minutes, make sure your order is correct
7 out of the past 10 times i have ordered they have left something out
They will also never offer to credit your account for more than the item
Unlike mostp laces that value your business and will give you a free appetizer next time
Also make sure to check your credit card statement as they often double charge your credit card
When questioned, they say this is a common occurance in the food industry
However working for a major financial firm, I can say this is not true
Dont come here if you expect taco bell
Do come here if you want real mexican food
To top it off, the price is great
What many other mexican restaurants call a chicken burritto, you get at this place for about $3 and they call it a quesadilla
Try some of the more interesting dishes like the stuffed peppers
Delivery is very reliable
Disappointed after reading all the good reviews
Nothing special, food bland, no air conditioning on a very hot summer day
This tiny little whole-in-the-wall taqueria has the best and most authentic Mexican food that I have had in NYC, with a great juke box of Latin hits to boot
This is by far the best Mexican food in NYC
My husband(who is Mexican) and I moved here from California last year and were dismayed at the lack of decent Mexican food here so we were overjoyed when we found this place
It holds its own against Mexican restaurants in California, and is inexpensive, to boot! The tacos are especially delicious
the only downside is the ever increasing wait for a table in this small hole in the wall
Excellent restaurant! I highly recommend it
Great food, great prices, GREAT FOOD! Come one, come all, but keep it small, i like it that way
By far the best mexican food in town! Great sauces and great service
Special orders are always made perfectly
Esto es comida mexicana!
A taste of my old country south of the border, Taqueria Y Fonda has captured the real flavor of Mexico
After eating here a couple of times it became one of the motivating factors for moving to the upper west side
I never hesitate to come to this place
It is a small place and it is always packed
The wait at times can be a little bit fustrating, but totally worth it
It is a clean place and everyone is polite
If you never been here, come and give it a try
By the way, did I mention that the prices are very reasonable
The food is delicious
I'm stunned at the wonderful reviews this place is getting
totally opposite of my experience! First of all, I found the place to be kind of divey from the outside and it also looked very hole in the wall when I went in
But, since the place was recommended, I stayed
The menu was dirty and greasy and when I ordered a pina colada, it came WITHOUT booze
Not just light on the booze, I'm talking NO BOOZE
When I complained and asked for some booze to be put in my drink, they returned it the same way
I wasn't about to argue more
My friend had dirty utensils, which reflects the way the place looked in general
The food was so-so
There wasn't much on the menu that appealed to me to begin with, and I ended up getting a spinach/pasta dish that was average AT BEST
Certainly nothing special
I think the thing that turned me off most was just the upkeep up the place; it looked dirty! Even if a place has great food, I can't get past the fact if it looks filthy
I was happy to get out of that place, I consider it a waste of my time completely!! BEWARE!
I bring everyone to this restaurant
My fiance and I were both recommended by a friend, and both warned about a long wait
Yes, that happens, but it's well worth it
The food is EXCELLENT
The wait staff are sometimes not 100%, but when you are working non-stop like they are, you just maybe can't operate at 100%
The prices are low for huge portions, and the food always comes quickly
Personally, I love the Peruvian food - broiled shrimp, spaghetti pesto, green rice (it's cilantro), half chicken, and lomo saltado are ALL consistently good
And yes, beware of the Nutcracker cocktail
YUM
The chinese food is great
The latin food is also amazing
I really love this restaurant, the food is out of this word, the drink is wonderful
The price is inexpensive, My children like the fish tank
I recommend the restaurant, is excellent
All time is full, so the service is very faster
The chicken is delicious and the special rice, oh my God! there are avocado salad and fried yellow platain, the menu is amazing
I really love it
I can not say enough about this place!! The food is amazing and I would eat it every day if I could! The drinks are also great
after two you will be feeling it
They are not singy at all

Looooved this place
Everything was good and our waiter was really really nice
I love been bone marrow, and they prepare it so well
I think this is one of the places I keep going back to for its food and service
I wish the place was bigger-probably that's the only complaint I have!!!
The sweetbreads were killer and so was everything else on the table
One of the all time best meals I have had in NYC
A great experience from start to finish
i am not much of a food critic, but my friend from SF is big in the resturant scene and he said this place is known as a place where chefs come to eat
The food was great and the service was top notch (thanks tall, bald guy!)
Only problem was that we waited for 90mins, but probably worth it
Oxtail was amazing
Come early, make reservations, explore Soho and then come back for a great meal
Cosy enviornment
The wait was too long
About 1 1/2 hour
Place is very small
Had around 10 tables
Thanks for the bread, but it's a bit too hard
Not a suprise on the menu
Same old, plain jane
Food is okay, but not great
At least the music was hip
For New York, this place is very trendy
In other word, just a normal restuarant
Definitely worth it
The food was amazingly good, and considering the fact that I showed up with a few friends really late at night, I was impressed with their service as well as with the quality of the meal
Time and time again I am duly impressed by this place - great energy, some of the best food in the city, the freshest raw bar, gracious and knowledgeable staff - though the waits can sometimes be a bit longer than you'd normally be willing to endure, you'll walk out each and every single time saying to yourself, that was so worth it!
We came here after 1130p on a Friday evening and they were able to accomodate our large party very quickly
As usual, the food was done wonderfully and reasonably portioned
I think the chef favors fruity sauces, but I don't mind and the food tastes great
I have the bone marrow every time I'm here and it is filling and satisfying every time
They had sea urchin that night and the critters were fresh, accompanied by a light soy+something dipping sauce -- perfect
There was a celebrity or two in the place (there always is every time we're here) and that hindered our service a bit
However, this place is easily the best in the city for a gourmet late night dinner
Don't tell anyone, though! It is already so popular, I don't want it to get even harder to get into
Listen, I went to blue ribbon on a whim with two of my boys on a Sat nite
We had planned to go bar/club hopping after
Well to make a long story short if this place spun music I would've spent the rest of my night there
The food? delectable, the service? the owners will bring out your food so as not to delay the experience
What more can you ask for? a shiatsu?! So get up and go, I'll see you at the bar
This place is the best
The food is incredible and the service is impeccable
You have to love a place that serves great food and treats you like a king, at 4am when you are drunk
I would recommend this place to everyone in the city
If you are downtown late night its a must
went here late night after a a few drinks at my favorite watering spot and was amazed that a place which serves food till 4 can be so damned good
a must have is the fondue as it is out of this world
the service was also among the best i have had in nyc
def a place to go back to
great food, great service - a bit cramped but worth it
While small, the menu is pretty varied and probably could fit any desire
Food was well prepared and really good
Here's a place where waiting for your table actually adds to the dinning experience
It gives you a chance to sit at the small, cozy bar, with your date and suck down raw oysters and well prepared drinks prepared by the overly nice bartender
The staff is the main reason I have made a recent return visit here
Everyone from the the clam shucker, to the waiters in their relaxed shorts, to the hostess, is very welcoming
The owner even shook my hand as I was leaving
Very good seafood, nice low-light lounge-type atmoshere, and great service are three reasons I tell my friends to take their girlfriend and/or nice-looking dates here
Becoming one of my favorites
Best oysters - best service - imaginative and tasty food not cheap at over $60 per head but was still good value
Only negative in a place so busy there is no need to add to the noise with music?? One of the best spots in Manhattan today
I read the reviews on this place and knew I had to try it
I am so glad I did! The place is very small but romantic with candlelight
The service was excellent and very friendly
The food
well, the food is out of this world!!!! We tried as many dishes as we could manage and every dish was excellent with a taste that keeps you coming back for more!!!
This place was truly amazing
First of all, when going to trendy places it's hard to find nice staff
This staff was the sweetest
So nice
The food was unbelievable and we had the best creme brullee
Try the skate and the catfish
Too die for!
Blue Ribbon is my favorite restaurant in New York City, by leaps and bounds
First, the food is amazing
Always the freshest ingredients and prepared perfectly
The menu is eclectic, offering everything from old favorites like fried chicken or hamburgers to dishes like Paella or skate
What stands out most is the raw bar, especially the oysters
I don't even like oysters, but at Blue Ribbon somehow I love them
Second, the service is not only intelligent (with respect to advice and description) but also friendly, smooth and extremely perceptive
Finally, the ambiance is perfect
Upbeat and active, but also mellow and romantic at the same time
The music selection is always right on the money
Blue Ribbon is the only restaurant I would ever wait for over an hour to eat at
Blue Ribbon is a New York institution
The waits are long due to its popularity and lack of reservations, but the bar is fun and the staff friendly
You can also go to another bar and call to check in on yur table
The menu is varied - from fine dining to turkey burgers - but it's all good
Wine list is a little spare and overpriced (the Rhones are good value)
Go with a date or in a group - either way, it's a blast
(I have only been to the SoHo location - home of Lorenzo, best oyster shucker in the city)
Since they opened a location in park slope I have become a fan
Alittle high priced for portion sizes but, over all good
stay away from the calamari but, enjoy the raw bar
Good selection on oysters fair wine list
Great when you get back from the city and need something to hold you over or to keep the night going
Great meeting place strong drinks
My favorite NY restaurant by far
Amazing food, and about the best service you will receive in the city

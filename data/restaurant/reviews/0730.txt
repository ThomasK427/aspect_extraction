The drinks are awesome, the food is inventive and fresh - you would be hard pressed to find this in chinatown, not to mention in chinatown you would not be eating in a Meier designed space
Prices are not too high
Everyone is dying to go here
but everyone claims to hate it
Player haters?
The food was okay
get the water chestnut scallop dumplings, not the foie gras dumpling - the taste is neither here nor there
get the fish dishes
the crackling pig was alright - the skin was cooked well, but the meat was a bit too dry
egg rolls and the sesame (vermacelli) noodles were yummy
the tuna tartar needed a pinch more salt
the brulee trio for dessert was delicious
Decor needless to say was cool,modern, and minimal
The recessed lighting was very flattering and set the mood and atmosphere
The music was good as well
the salmon tasted like flowers and the tan tan noodles were in a creamy sauce??? since you CAN get better food in c-town, as a diner, you need to accept the fact that you're eating food marked up (lots) for the ambiance and the fun drinks
won't go again, but glad to have tried it
Tremendous
We found this to be a truly tremendous dining experience
I just wish that I was able to take empty space and do with it as they have
They have maximized this large open space in a minimalist design that is quite pleasing and allows for everyone to part of a small dining room
The food was perfect
The dim sums were different, extremely tasty, and perfectly prepared
We had such a hard time narrowing down the appetizers and dim sums that we concluded that we could come back and make a meal of just apps and sums! The bass and duck were perfect and there were at least a few other main courses that we have to try
BTW - the unfiltered saki was great! The meal was topped off with lotus bulbs and poached pears
An absolute must return place
Well done Jean George!
The special drinks were undrinkable and wildly overpriced
The Chinese food was heavy, greasy and commonplace
The expected Franco-Chinese innovations were actually non-existent in that they tasted like all other undistinguished Chinese dishes on the menu
The dumplings were leaden, the dipping sauces tasteless
White rice was the best dish
I suggest that someone in the kitchen learn to cook Chinese food knowledgeably
Chef JG has clearly stretched himself too thin
Too bad
Dazzling Chinese served in a clean, modern atmosphere by competent attractive staff
Delicious dim sum selection, especially foie gras dumplings, scallion pancake, and lobster claws
Desserts were surprisingly great and fun: lime-coconut tapioca, ovaltine pudding, and seriously some of the best ice-creams i've ever had, coffee, passionfruit, mango
Reserve early, the restaurant gets impossibly crowded after 7pm on a tuesday night
I was excited to check this place out being a huge fan of the Jean George empire
However, it`s this simple
The food and service is not very good
Moreover, the scene and design is sooo played out
Avoid the cold noodles, the tuna tartar, the frog leg`s, the peking chicken was not so bad
The scallop chesnut combo didn`t do it for me
The food looks great but the flavors are missing
Chinese deserts tasted more like something from vong than from China
If you`re a serious foodie please save you`re money
the place was rockin
food was great with exception of a few dishes which were just good
Had the best peking duck of my life, as well as a delicious lobster with black bean sauce, and delectable cirtus spareribs
Atmosphere was almost too hip for its own good
Deceptively flattering lighting and simple, yet elegant decor, and overbearing waitstaff - I got harassed for switching my seat at the same table! - can't save this mediocrity
The seafood, such as bass and shrimp, is great, but the dim sum was below average and the meats and desserts inedible
Save your money, or wait until Jean Georges retools it
He (and we) can do better
The 66 Coldnoodles were so great the four of us ordered a another! My first impression was good the building is georgeous and the interior design is similar to Asia de Cuba and very minimulist
The service is the best Manhatten has to offer
No bar only a waiting area with about 10 tables where you can have drinks prior to dinner
What to order- 66 noodles, tuna tartar, shrimp dimsum, stir fry chinese noodles
My party did not love the meats on the menu maybe the pork dumplings but nothing else
I loves the noodles and the cookie box and coconut sorbet! Good place for dinner and drinks not soley for drinks
I went with a sizeable group and let the chef order for us, and he chose well, mostly
Deep-fried frog's legs (tender, flavorful, surprising), squab w/mango and greens, sea-bass in chile sauce, and a tender Peking chicken w/black pepper stood out as inventive and very well executed
The dim-sum was unremarkable at best, though
Anise in shrimp-foie-gras dumplings was way too strong
It's hard, even for the French, to reinvent perfection
The worst choice of the night, shrimp-fried rice w/unsticky rice (the heresy!)
If anyone from the restaurant is reading this, for the love of China, take fried rice off the menu! In fact, please, take all the obligatory Chinese standards off
Design was pleasant, uncluttered, hip
Jean-Georges sent out way too many to count, but we shared all the dishes, and the bill was utterly reasonable
It was a fairly generous experience
i am not a fan of traditional chinese cuisine and after reading the reviews posted here at citysearch i wasn't sure what to expect
by the end of the evening however i was very pleasantly surprised
note - those looking for authentic chinese cusine will be sorely disappointed
although there are cantonese influences, there are also heavy french and subtle vietnamese influences as well
the shrimp/foie gras dumplings were delicious as were the scallop and water chestnut dumplings
the cold sesame noodles were a nice start too
the veal tenderloin was done perfectly and the lemon chicken was the best i've ever had! the desserts were great - GREAT!! i would recommend this place to everyone i know
this place is amazing
the menu is deep and filled with outstanding french-chinese dishes
you'll be amazed at how a new restaurant opened with such an outstanding and developed menu
the room is also a masterpiece of design that is hip, beautiful, calming and interesting all at the same time
the wine list has the best saki i've ever had
the service was awkward at times, but that's to be expected in a new place and at least they were genuinely trying their best
i will definitely be going back several times as i want to try several of the dishes that we didn't have room for - once is definitely not enough at 66
If you like Canteen, Asia De Cuba, Industry(food), etc
you're going to love 66
Who cares if the food isn't all that, it's the overall feeling that you get from eating at 66 that makes it's spectacular
The interior design is chic-minamalist and the staff is super friendly and really knowledgable
The crowd is superhot and spicy
Yeah baby!!!
After having read the last few reviews on citysearch I was not looking forward to going but glad I did
I don't know what everyone is complaining about
It's this simple: the food was good, some dishes very good
Desserts were delicious however pass on the ovaltine pudding
The service was excellent and the atmosphere was great
As for the price , it's very typical of a decent New York restaurant
I guess Chinese is Chinese, regardless of who the chef is
ok, ambiance is nice, staff can be friendly, except the french yahoo at the door

I would recommend it
Having been to many of the restaurants in New Orleans, I found the Sunday brunch to be quite disappointing
There was nothing cajun about it except for the jazz
The decor was nice though
The cod fish was a basic small piece of fish, the rice was NOT dirty rice, and the gumbo did not have enough pizzazz, just lots of onions
Anyone who has been to the great city in Louisiana, would not call this a cajun restaurant
Delta is a much better cajun place to go to
Even Popeye's dirty rice is better! Once is enough
If you like tuna rolls go here for some of the best in NYC! They are divine little conncoctions oh so fresh
The ambience is pleasing and the prices are fair for what you get
The only down side is the staff
They are a little aloof not that attention, but not rude by any means
Overall, a good value
The tuna was very fresh and the spicy tuna roll was one of the best that I have ever tasted
We ordered the sushi boat for 2-3 people and there was a spicy tuna roll, in which there were slabs of spicy tuna
Service is not that great
It took forever for them to refill our water and to clear our area when we were done eating
The sushi quality is okay
Come here for their tuna
I love their rolled sushi!!!!! They all look beautiful and taste nice
Service is very friendly and very kind
I really enjoyed dinner time
I do go back there again
when you want sushi, you want it fresh and innovative and you want to feel that you've gotten value
This neighborhood place gives all three
The fish is great, always great
The spicy tuna and the salad are totally different from any others and never fail to please
The service excels
it is not a fancy or overpriced place and doesn't suffer from being the in place
Not chic but great
tast of tokyo started out as just our neighborhood japanese restaurant, and we loved it
Now that we have moved from the area, we still travel back there for the excellent salad, fresh sushi and friendly service
After seeing so many 10s, I had to try it myself just to be sure
The food was regular and it wasn't cheap
average is more like it
for the same price, i would go to Yama on carmine street, or Yuka in the UES
I was disappointed to say the least
best sushi in NYC?  Are you insane?  The food here is adequate, nothing special at all
The service is nice, the prices are low
I can't believe how people give out 10's so easily
I wonder if it's the same individuals who gave McDonalds 9's and 10's
For the money this place has OK food
The sushi is much better than their hot dishes
The price is decent for Manhattan
Service was provided by what seemed like the owner, or a family member of
Not a professional by any means
None the less it was overall a pleasant experience and I would go back there again
This place is 100% the best sushi in NEW YORK CITY
You cant go wrong
Small cute little restaurnt with staff that even remembers your name-makes you feel right at home! Fabulous food-must have the spicy tuna salad
Sushi fresh off the boat! Dont want millions of people going but I had to share the secret
ENJOY!
You would have ever thought that place called Taste of Tokyo (sounds too much like Terikayi Boy) would have good sushi/sashimi? I sure didn't, especially when I saw their tattered purple awning
If my friend didn't swear by it, I would have missed their wonderful lunch boxes
I had the sashimi with miso soup, tempura, salad and california roll for $10
25
So good for so cheap
Tasty and the portions were large
Go and take a friend
With so many japanese restaurants in the area, it's hard to choose which one to eat at
I tried this place once and was hooked
Their food is fresh, well prepared, and hasn't let me down yet
The service is decent, and the prices are pretty reasonable
The ambiance is great, not overdone, very relaxing
They also have great lunch specials
Been coming here for 2 years now
Highly recommend the broccoli and tofu in peanut sauce or the cous-cous entree
I have been to too many vegetarian restaurants that served bland meals
Here you don't miss out on taste while trying to eat healthy
Very good healthy cuisine with a nicely varied menu
Especially tasty are the salads, sandwiches and vegan desserts
Service is friendly and helpful and atmosphere is laid-back
Recommend this to healthy eaters as well as those trying to be so
Tasty, healthy food and wines, conveniently located, and without a drop of pretension
I've never had a bad meal here, and the service is friendly and relaxed (in a good way)
I eat here very often (and could probably every night ) and can't say enough great things about their food
It is fresh, wholesome and filling
The tofu with shitake mushroom is my favorite!!!
Went there with friends and the ambiance was great
We had prompt service, food was great
I would highly recommend the goat cheese tart one of the best things I've tasted
My boyfriend and I came here for my 21st birthday and everything was wonderful
We had a delicious candlelit dinner
Everything from the escargot to the lamb was flavorful with a lovely presentation
The waitress was very helpful in picking out a bottle of wine for us, which turned out to be fantastic
This restaurant is definitely worth going to
Although my boyfriend and I were seated in the back in the terrace room, far removed from the fireplace, the succulent food more than made up for the seating
The mussels tasted a tad off, but the escargot was nicely seasoned
The salmon had an interesting but delicious smoky flavor
The vegetables and polenta were tasty and well-complimented the entrees
The duck was juicy and flavorful
For dessert, my boyfriend had a pineapple cake with mango ice cream while I had a delicious French pastry with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce
We finished with an excellent port and cognac
The service was attentive, although the waiter was a bit standoffish
The food, however, was divine and I would highly recommend it for a special occasion or a romantic evening
It was one of the best dining experiences I've had in NYC
Don't look any further
The food is delicious, plenty of wine by the glass to choose from and the service is as attentive as it is jovial
The owner makes you feel at home and we felt like regulars on our second visit
We will be back soon

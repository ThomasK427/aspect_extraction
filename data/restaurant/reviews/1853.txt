I actually enjoy it more since they started the no-smoking policy; but either way, it's a wonderful little place
Try the chicken sandwich
Tiramissou is to die for
Great location, atmosphere, and not expensive
Friendly staff and great to eat outside in the spring and summer
Very cosy and warm in the winter
We love to take out from cafe gitane
Their smoked chicken sandwich with mango on raisin bread, plus a great little side salad is just 10 dollars
It is a whole meal, not just a sandwich
The couscous is delicous
The waitresses are slow, but as long as you are relaxed, they eventually get it all to you and make sure you are taken care of
For the prices and taste, you cannot do better in the city
We happened to stumble into this place while searching for another resturant was very pleased we did
Fabulous food for little money
Small but quaint
The service was exceptional
I can't wait to go back and bring other friends
I can't stop raving about this place to everyone who I know
Cafe Gitane is not only the best coffee in NYC, its maintained its relaxed, don't follow the crowd atmosphere and if anything the food just gets better every time you go
Whoever wrote the Cafe non-Gitane review recently posted on this site is clearly better suited to a soul-less chain restaurant, (try something in times square
) - My only complaint is that they were once out of Vegemite, but I suspect this won't bother many of you
I'm curious as to whether Cafe Gitane has recently been bought by Reese and is becoming a chain cafe? Will it now be serving NY Strip steaks served with wooden handled knives and complimentary bottled beer before 5pm? The once charmed ambiance of Gitane is now marred with the new no smoking policy (whereas before you could smoke after 6pm), and the surprise-store-looking uniforms the waitresses now wear
Once my neighborhood favorite, it is not anymore
Goodbye, European charm
Hello, stifled middle America
The Scene The once-closet-sized Mexican Radio has moved to become a full-blown restaurant with a large bar area and two floors of seating
Thankfully, even in a larger space, Mexican Radio retains its intimate and unique feel
The Food  The menu consists of an "autentica" array of Mexican dishes, including some of the best guacamole in the city
Be sure not to miss out on the refined and tasty margaritas
All in all, an unpretentious but modish place to go where, as before, you can still sip on a Corona and eat a quesadilla while listening to an original un-cut version of a Rolling Stones album
Now you'll just have more elbow room
I just went here the other night for dinner to escape the heat and cool off with some margharitas
which were awesome (I got the XFile and tried my friend's frozen mango)
I got there and the hostess was pleasent and sat us sooner than expected
We had the guacolmorle appetizer and I had the enchaladas for my main course
They were great, very generous with the cheese and I recommend the house mole, which I couldn't get enough of
Our waitress was really layed back, helpful and, although seemingly swamped with other tables (the place was bustling), was very attentive and didn't rush us
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the mood for an attitiude-free mexican experience
The food is undeniably good
All NYC Mexican restaurant raves about their guac but Mexican Radio DOES have the best
The chile rellanos were also amazing (I still can't stop thinking about them!) Now the problems
The service was
Well
Not really service
Our waitress wasn't v
friendly
She wasn't really rude either but I felt like I was eating at some cheap taco stand instead of a restaurant
She only became friendly when the manager (or he might be the owner) was around
He, however, gave great service even though he just brought our food since they didn't have a runner
The bartender was also extra friendly
I could understand the lack of service if it was a cheap restaurant - but the prices are a bit expensive for the lack of service, decor and ambiance
All in all, I'm torn between the amazing food and the bitter service
I'll go back - but I'll hope our waitress isn't working that night - which are Mondays around 4pm
We ate at Mexican Radio during the week
We started off with the mixed margaritas
The drinks were made VERY well, not too strong or too weak
The food was excellent (forgot what we ate, I had a few drinks), we were there with another couple, and the four of us did not have any food complaints
The only thing was that they ran out of flan, and it was kind of early in the evening to run out
The waitress was pleasant, and the bathrooms were large and clean, another sign of a well kept place
I would return here without question
This is the place to be for heaping portions of really good, authentic mexican food
Decor is what you'd expect of a small, cute, quaint restaurant
The service is good if at times unattentive
The food is excellent
The salsa and guacamole was good
My chicken quesidilla was excellent and overall, everyone's meal was good
FYI, the margaritas here are potent
Great place for cheap eats and strong drinks
The margarita's are one of the best that I have ever had
If you can agree on the flavor the pitcher is the best value
The service was mediocre and rushed
The entrees were good and generous however the appetizer guacamole was good but WAY over priced and small, not to mention this was the first Mexican restaurant that I have ever been to that charges for chips and salsa and I do not mean seconds
We were charged 10
95 for a small guacamole portion and salsa and we did not receive the salsa
This is a great after work bar for margaritas but not a great night out with friends for dinner place
As a person who was always extremely disappointed with Mexican food on the East Coast, I can tell you that Mexican Radio is like finally reconnecting with a long-lost friend! Visions of SFO dance in my head! Food is fab, margaritas go down waaaaaaaaayyy too easy and it's just a fun, hopping place to be
Definitely need reservations at night so I'm trying to get there for lunch sometimes
Oh, and the $10
95 brunch is to die for!
Great food and amazing ambience! Good for any occasion
birthday, date, or just because
The first time I went to Mexican Radio my experience was less than perfect, however, I have been back since and I can not say enough good things! The margaritas are the best in town, the food is perfectly spicy and the staff is great
I am so glad I came back a second time as this has become one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the city
I recommend it fully
The food was great
I was with a party of 10 and we all ordered different things and everyone really enjoyed what they ordered
The portions were perfect in size and food preparations were done well so you didn't feel overstuffed and gross after
The margarita's were fantastic and the service was good
Great place for big groups
Also, they had our table all ready for us when we got there we called ahead with a reservation
Great for groups- make a reservation in advance
Good veggie options- cheese burritos are amazing
Nice, strong margaritas
Service could be better and place is small
but definitely recommended for groups and a great place to start off the night
I went to Mexican Radio for the first time last night and it is now my favorite Mexican Restuarant
Being from LA it's not often I find Mexican food I like on the east coast and the Margarita's are tasty as well as potent
The Bartender was so nice and made great recommendations on what to order
I can't wait for my next visit
I used to eat at this restaurant all the time because it was literally right around the corner from my apartment

We orered calamari for an appetizer as well as a bottle of wine
The calamari was great
I ordered a steak au poivre which tasted wonderful and my boyfriend ordered a seafood plate
Both plates were superb and the spices they used were interesting
For dessert we shared the apple tort and the waiter brought it out with a birthday candle
What was really sweet was that the dessert was on the house
We're both already talking about going back again
Started my meal off with the La Tarte Au Cpes (Wild mushrooms with goat cheese Leeks in puff pastry) The goat cheese is on the bottom and once you taste that
yummy
Ordered a bottle of Chateau Simard (1990-only $45bucks) It was a real complex wine
With its age you can almost taste the other herbs that must have been growing around the original grapes back in France
I had this stuffed quail special
IT WAS AMAZING
Stuffed with prisciutto and crab
It was awesome
Our waiter Stephen was very charismatic
Before we started our meal we were asked whether we would be having any of their Souffls for dessert, because those took time to prepare
We did have it, and i was like a little school boy when it came out
So so good
The ambience and scenery were nice too
The way I view a restaurant might be different than others
I go by the Good Time Factor
I have been to Le Belle Vie 3 times now and have had a great time each time
The food is good (better than good twice), the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is fantastic
This combination allows for a fantastic time!
Good deal for the lover of simple French fare, as well as some tasty pasta dishes including lobster and veal
The martinis were perfect, the dessert (tarte aux pommes with cinammon ice cream) was among the best I've had
There were even French guys having dinner there
the sound of French mingled with the very pleasant background mix of Big Band and classic songs, none of which intruded on the pleasant evening and food
This is a great neighborhood restaurant for great French food
The waiters are fine--but the owner is extremely rude
He was antagonistic, sarcastic and patronizing when we wanted to add onto our order
Their lunch hours last until 3pm, but he charged us dinner prices! When we confronted him, he said, that the mistake was not his, but the waiters and somebody had better pay, yelling, YOU ATE THE FOOD, DIDN'T YOU? over and over! Food was nothing to write home about
The service is sloppy
The furniture is tacky and that spoils the ambience completely
The staff is very impolite and the service very very casual
Wasnt served water till the end of the meal ! Food is so so ! I would suggest walking a few blocks east to Cafe Spice on University and 10th
I dont have enough words to describe how terribly the new Amin on 7th Ave is
My first experience was calling them for delivery
They hung up on me several times because they were busy, then when I finally got my order through, they didnt show up to deliver my food til 2 hours later! A week later, I decided to try one more time and this time pick it up myself
The staff ignored me for over a half hour when I came to pick up my food, were very rude, got my food wrong (and the person in front of me) and in the end
the food was only mediocre
Take out from Amin (the lunch special is terrific) is always a delight -- excellent basmati, luscious curries, great nan, paratha and onion fritters
Seafood curries in particular are delectable, and the service is always polite
This place is an enigma
Terrific curries, but the room is so often empty
Lured in by the prominent display of Zagat praise, I expected delicious food and the prices seemed reasonable, at least the food ones
Not being given a wine or drink menu was the first clue that I would be gouged for the sangria I ordered
But first, the food
I ordered a tortilla espanola which was quite tasty, but by no means complex (egg and potato)
Along with the meal came some tasty bread, and a small plate of antipasto, including a delicious non-fried, cold form of patatas bravas and olives
I also ordered chorizo al vino, which was VERY disappointing
It tasted like cheap hot dogs with chorizo flavoring: it clearly lacked quality and was bought on the cheap
Now for the sangria
I ordered an individual serving, which came in a small pitcher that filled two glasses and cost $9
00
That may seem like a deal, considering the price 2 glasses of wine
However, the contents of most sangria is only half wine and half other inexpensive ingredients, AND, you can choose the cheapest wine on the shelf and it should still taste good
I agree with the other posters that this sangria tasted watered down, considering that in Spain two glasses would give you more than a nice buzz
I don't like places that sacrifice quality for money or play tricks on you by hiding drink prices till check time (everyone at the place was drinking Sangria, so that, it seems, must be the money-maker)
Customer service was above average
The food is really great and the Sangria is tasty, strong and will get you nicely toasted
I live around the corner and have been going here for 6 years
I have never had a bad meal and all my friend from out of town refuse to go anywhere else but this place when they come to visit
You eat and drink a ton and it always comes out to about $40/person
You have to know what to order because there are a lot of average tapas
Try the sweetbreads, chorizo, croquettes, cod basque style, and shrimp with garlic sauce
Those are our favorites They also make great paella
Had a reservation at el cid last night with 8 people from my office
It was really fun there -- a lot of tasty food and a very nice and accomodating staff
The tapas were solid, nothing out of this world, but definitely good flavors with much variety (there were also several specials available)
We drank 8 pitchers of sangria - both red and white (we liked the red better)
Memorable dishes were the chorizo, the croquettes, the meatballs, the shrimp
Unfortunately, no patatas bravas, but when we asked if they could make them the chef did put in a noteworthy attempt
Everthing arrived promptly and the waiters were very quick to refill wine glasses and keep things moving along without making us feel like we were being rushed out of there
We finished the meal with a HUGE seafood paella which was completely tasty
It makes me remember Spain
Small dark places with wonderful tapas
No-nonsense waiters and good food
I have been coming here for years and have to say, that it is still as good as before
I love this place
I had an excellent dining experience at El Cid
First off, the food was excellent, I've never had such tasty meat balls
The service was fast too
I highyl recommend El Cid
I was very disappointed by this restaurant for several reasons
One, I did not find it economical at all
I found it quite overpriced
Secondly, the sangria was the worst I have ever had, completely watered down, and no taste
Thirdly, the food was simply mediocre and the portions exceptionally small
Fourth, I found the place had no atmosphere nor personality, BORING!! My friends and I wanted to get the check and get out of there as soon as possible
This restaurant was completely overpriced and the tapas were terrible
You can get a better Spanish meal for a better price at several other restaurants in the city
I do not recommend this bland food at $7 - 9 a plate
The sangria also tasted like a cheap wine cooler
The food and the value had been ok on our meal, and then after only a little more than an hour, the check was slipped onto the table for our large party, and a few minutes later, waiters began yelling at us to leave
We tried explaining nicely to them that we were just finishing up a drink, and after a brief, unprofessional discussion with the two waiters, they told us never to come back again
Unfortunately, we had already left our tip at that point
Embarassingly poor
Had a great experience @ El Cid last saturday night

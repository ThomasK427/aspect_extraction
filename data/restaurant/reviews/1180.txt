It was just a spectacular experience overall
They suggested that I pre-select a menu for the group
I chose 3 apps, 1 salad, 3 entrees, and a dessert platter
all for $45!
The food was served family style so everyone got some of everything
They were very accomodating especially when some of my guests were stuck in traffic and delayed the meal
They had to keep us moving since they had another large party later in the evening
When they had to sort of gently usher us out, they gave us a free round of drinks upstairs
We felt totally attended to and never rushed
The food was phenomenal, everyone was stuffed, and the place was gorgeous
Excellent place for a large dinner
And the homemade Oreos are to die for! HIGHLY recommend
Stanton Social is a great place! You definitely need a reservation, but if you don't mind the wait, it's well worth it
Great place to go with a group of friends - we ate upstairs in the lounge, ordered about 7 dishes
The french onion soup dumplings are unique and incredible! Highly recommended!
The pretty decent quality of the food is uniquely disserved by the pretentiousness and unpleasantness of the patrons and clientele, the haughtiness of the managers, and the quasi-Meatpacking District ambience
If the restaurant was empty or at least frequented by a less abrasive and annoying audience it would almost be an enjoyable experience
Skip it: nothing unique
I live within spitting distance of this place so I thought I'd it check it out-big mistake
The super-pretentious staff is not only poorly dressed, but exceptionally rude
The drinks are over-priced and designed for the middle-aged
The music would be great if I enjoyed soft rock as much as the owners must
If I had it all to do over, I would have gone anywhere, and I mean anywhere but here
I left this place wondering how anyone could pretend to like it that doesn't live in corporate housing or Jersey
Went for the first time last Saturday
Too late to get a reservation so we went upstairs where initially the crowded scene threw me for a loop
However, didnt take too long to get drinks and the hostess seated us promptly
Although it was a little cramped and the tables are low and small, we made due
ended up having 4 small plates, french onion soup dumplings, nori tuna roll, lobster rolls, and red snapper tacos
I recommend them all cept the tacos and the dumplings were exceptional
Service was a little slow at first but picked up and despite the overall busyness, the staff were very attentive
Be sure to make a rez for downstairs if raucous bar scenes with cramped qtrs arent your scene
I've been trying to figure out how to describe this place
the food was ok, nothing jumped out at me, the space is beautiful and I mean beautiful but the service is horrendous and I mean really really bad
the price is what it is, eventually everything about LES is going to change but for the prices here, I should have at least better service than what I got
Seems like the staff is as stuck up as some of the bridge and tunnel crowds that come here
I sure hope they get their act together
A friend reccommended Stanton Social-- ended up having a fabulous meal and some fabulous drinks
Every item we got was better than the next-- loved the meatballs, perogies and onion soup dumplings
Service was fabulous, food was outstanding
highly reccommend
Enjoy!
This was a most wonderful meal, good for going with a few people and trying a bit of everything
The dessert menu was to die for
how often do you see a dessert menu that you want to order everything on the list?
went here with a few friends on a friday night-- we couldn't get a table, so we ate upstairs in the lounge
the seating is a little awkward-- they stuff you in on couches with only a small table area (which is actually a surface that slides in over the couch)
despite the close quarters, the food was amazing
the french onion soup dumplings were fantastic-- completely original and like nothing i've ever tasted
the sliders were excellent as was the goat cheese salad
and the warm donuts tasted like heaven on a plate
it's not a place to go for quiet conversation and the service was a little spotty, but the food is tasty, the atmosphere is fun, and the bill was very reasonable for the amount of food we got to taste
i'm excited to go again!
been here twice--once on a date, once with a birthday group of 9, and both times had a great time
Tasty kobe sliders, dumplings , etc, i
e
fun, simple food
Definitely loud crowded though, so if that's not your scene head elsewhere
While this lower east side spot may be hot the food and service is horrible
We were with a group of 12
The waiter recommmended that we order 2-3 items per person
It was a nightmare since the wait staff couldn't seem to get anything out on time or out hot
The screwed up the oreders and served all the wrong dishes
The staff was rude and rushed us out in an hour
We had a bill of over $800 and I was starving at the end of the night
Their chocolate fondue consisted of a plate of cold chocolate with no fire
Come to people watch and drink, but stay away from the food and service
This establishment makes all the great places down town look bad
The food was great and the price more than reasonable for NYC
However, the service was absolutely horrible
It took us 20 minutes to track down our waitress to receive our check even though the restaurant was not busy at that point
Furthermore, the whole place (upstair and downstairs) has only three bathroom stalls total for a place that seats at least 60 people downstairs and an equal amount of customers upstairs -- creating constant lines
Seating is very tight with too many tables for the space
My only good experience here was at the bar upstairs (not on a Saturday night)
When I tried the restaurant (with a group of 4) it was a different experience -- I won't ever eat there again
Terrible, terrible service - or management
Waited over an hour for a table that I reserved for -- a lousy table in the noisy, hot stuffy upstairs
The food wasn't worth the wait, either
Plenty of nice, new places to eat in NYC that know how to manage a busy night
Stick to the bar
Mediocre at best
There are too many amazing places in Manhattan to waste your time and money here
but I mean that in a good way
The atmosphere is great and the food is interesting and tasty but not out this world or anything
We had a shrimp dish which was really good, a salad which was also good, a chicken dish which I actually did not like and the choc dessert is amazing!! The service, I thought, was excellent and we made a reservation and had a lovely booth right in the front
There's a cool bar upstairs if you want to hang around afterwards
Besides the dessert, I don't think there is anything particularly memorable about this place but I would go back if I ever run out of places to try down there
i went there with a small group - 3 people
we were seated at a horrible table (at the front of the restaraunt in a high traffic spot
We asked for a different table (twice) and were denied and made to feel like second-rate patrons
Despite the rudeness of the hostesses - the food was okay
however, when my friend got up to use the ladies room, her chair was takten away immediately to bring to another table
my husband had to chase the bus boy down to get the chair back
i have never been treated so poorly at a restaraunt in my life
our entire meal was on the house, but i would have been happy to pay for it to be treated like a human! with the management style, i don't think santon will last - and it shouldn't
Got the scoop on this new hot spot and decided to give it shot for a client dinner
Aside from being far away from the office, we are in Chelsea, as soon as we walked in it was clear we were going to have a great night
The decor and vibe were fun and upbeat
The drink menu was a hit, I recommend the What a Wonderful World a nice refreshing cocktail, perfect for after work decompression! The food was great, we loved the small plate sharing philosophy and the selection was super fun
You have to try the lobster rolls, kobee beef mini-burgers, French onion dumplings and the mahi-mahi satays with the peanut orange dipping sauce!!!! I thought it couldn't get any better and then we ordered dessert - say it with me

Waste of Money!!!!!!  Don't FORGET to check your bill B4 putting down any tips! The TIP it's already included 20%!
IT DID!!!!!! It was one of the last restaurants we tried in our 6 day trip to the Big Apple
I would have cut my trip short a day to not have had this experience
Informed our server at the begining we were time conscious
He began by not bringing me the correct salad
I let this slide since we were in a hurry
The entree was not quite what the menu said in terms of preparation
The dessert was substandard in taste/presentation
These were the least of our problems
The check came with incorrect amounts, and gratuity was already added as well
I had to force the server to amend the bill and my credit card charge
My card was charged twice
I called the restaurant, no manager is available
I have been waiting four days for a return call to resolve just this issue
Think twice
Went with a friend on a Thursday night
We didn't have reservations, but were told we'd be seated in 5 minutes
Five minutes became fifteen and we were finally seated
We ordered the prixe fix
The food was good, but the service left much to be desired
Our server did not check on us, ask if we needed anything, refill our water or get our dessert order right
We tried to wave him down several times, to no avail
We even had to flag him down for our check
We won't be back - we can get reasonably priced brazillian food somewhere else
I came here preshow on a Tues
night
I ordered the Beef Amazonas (grilled steak with a red wine, beer, butter and garlic sauce
) It was cooked medium to perfection and the sauce excellent
The garlic was fried to a great texture and the sauce went with the fries and rice amazingly well
We ordered fried yuca (not the best, but good)
My friend ordered the Chicken BossaNova which was a form of fried chicken with spices
This was good too, but I enjoy foods with a sauce more
The rice and the black bean sauce on the side was good as well
The bread they served at the beginning was mediocre
The service was excellent
My only complaint would be that they had only one bathroom with one stall
On a busier night, I would've had to wait a lot longer
All in all, I had a great experience
I've been to this establishment about four times and I've had the best time
This restaurant does not deserve the bad wrap that is has received
I've recommended the Brazil Grill to my friends and they have all loved it and taken their friends there
the restaurant is always busy, but they always find you a spot to seat, doesnt matter how many people in the party, and if they dont have a table right away you can always seat in the bar and have a brazilian drink
The Scene Neatly tucked into 46th Street's Restaurant Row, Lattanzi walks a nice line between comfortable and ornate, with flowers, candles and white tablecloths complementing exposed brick and handsome architectural photographs
The two-room restaurant is well-attended every night, with a mostly middle-aged clientele of theatergoers
The Food Pre-theater and at lunch, the menu is sturdy, delicious Italian
Wonderful homemade pastas, such as the fettuccine with a meat ragu, arrive in large portions, though the sizing of the other entrees can be small
At 8pm, the Italian-Jewish (though not kosher) menu is added, offering such dishes as a red snapper that gets an unusual kick from vinegar and raisins, a rich tomatoey stew of cannellini and tender fish, and excellent, deeply flavored rosemary roast chicken
Artichokes are a signature ingredient of this classic cuisine; order one fried or batter-fried to start
I had dinner here with my wife before we caught a show and both were pleasntly surprised with Lattanzi
They have a very large restaurant that has a nice romantic setting and the food was cooked perfectly, tasted great and a nice size portion
We will definitely come back for dinner next time we are in NY for a show!!!
I simply LOVE this restaurant!!! The ambiance is beautiful! Very romantic and cozy
The food is fabulous but make room for dessert and try the Napoleon
I've never tasted such an exquisite dessert
Don't miss it!! Try Lattanzi after the theater rush
It is a lot more quieter and the staff is more attentive
the concierge in our hotel offered to make us reservations after the theater for dessert
She sent us to Lattanzi on Restaurant Row
What a surprise when they walked us upstairs to the terrace room
It was pretty and intimate
I had fresh strawberries and cognac and my boyfriend had the chocolate mousse and a sambuca with coffee
The staff really made us feel welcome
We will be back!
I travel back and forth to Italy several times a year and so I was truly pleased with my dining experience at Lattanzi
Not only was the food genuine and wonderfully prepared but the service of the staff, in particular the maitre' d who treated us (we were a group of 7) as if we've been dining there for years!! was warm and inviting
Lattanzi has a very familiar feel to it
because of the staff and the food is wonderful
we have dined at lattanzi's aprox
6 times, since we believed it was one of the best restaurants on restaurant row
but unfortunately our service last night was essentially ineffective
in summary the artichokes were grand
the chicken dishes were very good, the veal valdestona was slightly better than average, and the zababaglione was only fair
I expect that the poor service was a sign of poor supervision by the maitre d'
We probably will return because of convenience to the theatre district, but not with same gusto as before
jbarie
I had been lloking and searching for this restaurant for a long time, but a colleague at work finally told me the secret of this beautiful hidden place
The atmosphere is very cozy and italian
Once you are in it seems almost like being at home
Funny because I am from Italy and the food is fantastic and the most of the staff speaks very well italian
It is a must to see if you are in New York
I highly reccomend you to eat the artichokes or the bucatini alla Matriciana which are delightful tasty and authentic
Ciao  Giovanni
The warm cozy and classy decor wowed us when we stepped into the restaurant, and friendly service further raised our expectation, but alas did the dishes come as a disappointment
The appetizers were decent -- asparagus with parmasean cheese was flavorful and tender, but the mozzarella with grilled peppers lacked consistency and the artichokes were simply too greasy
Came the main dishes, and the Risotto con Funghi was just as greasy if not more and tasteless, while Ravioli ai Funghi was way too salty
Another dish (cant even remember exactly what it was, with tomato sauce) had pasta cooked only halfway and the sauce short of the rich flavors Italian cuisine calls for
Only the lasagna was remotely commendable and even that we couldnt finish
Overall, great place for the eye but not for the tummy
The service was very gracious and attentive though, maybe recommended for a date
After a wonderful trip to Rome I was hoping to relive some of the culinary pleaseures back in NYC, but alas, it was not to be
Lattanzi is very cozy, but the service was distracted and the food was ordinary Ital-American and EXTREMELY expensive
The famed fried artichokes were horrendously greasy, not at all like their delightful Roman cousins, and my Veal Romana (though supposedly Roman, it was described as Milanese-style, go figure) was also super-greasy and topped with a thick slab of rubbery mozarella
A tab over $100 for two, without dessert, means I will never return
AFTER LIVING SEVEN YEARS IN ROME AND BEING ITALIAN, I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD FIND AN AUTHENTIC ROMAN RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK
THE SERVICE IS JUST LIKE ITALY VERY RELAXED SO THAT THE DELIGHTED FOOD CAN BE ENJOYED
I WAS ABLE TO FIND A TRUE ROMAN WINE FALINGINA FOUND ONLY IN ROME AND NAPLES
THE ASSORTMENT OF FOOD WAS AMAZING AND THE TASTE OF ROME WAS IN EVERY DISH
THE PASTA IS PERFECT NO MATTER WHICH ONE YOY GET AND THE SECONDS ARE ALL PREPARED IN THE ROMAN WAY
THE PERSON WHO RATED THIS A 5 JUST DOESN'T KNOW WHAT ITALIAN COOKING IS ABOUT FOR FOR THAT MATTER WHAT ANY COOKING IS ABOUT
Our family has been visiting New York for over 20 years

They have the original Sala restaurant on the Bowery where I have had dinner a few times, but now they just opened Sala one-nine, which is open for lunch and dinner
I have already been there three times since they've opened, once for lunch where I had the most amazing spanish sandwich, and twice for dinner with a group of friends
One of the nights was on a Saturday, and they were very busy, so I would recommend making reservations
The decor is dark and sexy and the food is simply amazing!
I did taste one appetizer which was quite good
However, the restaurant lost our reservation and although it was early and the place was still fairly empy, the host was extremely rude obnoxious about the terms under which he would accomodate our party
Only once we decided to leave did he lose the arrogant NY attitude
No thanks buddy
Beware of this place on a Saturday night
They think they're hot and seem one step away from putting out a velvet rope
Get over yourself Sala One Nine
I don't need the attitude with so many other fish in the sea
i went to sala one-nine on saturday with a group of friends and had great time
not only we had great food and wine, but also we have been accommodated in perfect manners although the place was packed
i'll definitely go back
thanks sala one-nine
I used to live in the east village and frequented the original Sala for tapas and sangria
Sala 19 is near my current job and I am impressed
During the day I can get a quick sandwich, soup or salad
The front window is a choice seat if I have the time to sit
At dinner I went with my boyfriend
We sat at the bar and enjoyed more small plates and yes, the sangria
The attitude is always friendly if maybe a little more posh at night, but that's to be expected
The vibe is romantic and old world without feeling stuffy
Food, service and decor have made this another favorite for tapas
We were a party of 11
The staff was attentive helpful with suggestions
The food was extraordinary
We recommend
Brought a group of 11 for a friends Birthday on 2/19/05
Service was excellent
The tapas was amazing, especially the Portobello mushrooms and it may have been the best Mussels I've ever had
I don't really drink but my friends enjoyed the Sangria and we all had a good time
Hands down the best Indian food I've had in NY
The place isn't fancy like Taj across the street but the food is absolutely delicious!! Was introduced to it by an Indian friend and have been hooked ever since
Just has to be the worst restaurant I ever ate at
the management is abusive to staff, seem to be no organization food takes a long time
inexperienced waitstaff
would not recomend
I have been to Pho a few times
I must admit my first experience was a bit horrendous because I was unaware we had to cook our meal
I went back the second time and had the grill chicken which was very delicious
The condiments are great
Basically it's something quick and cheap
I thought the Pho was so-so and was content to continue eating here whenever I felt like Pho, until my most recent experience, which makes me never want to go back there again
First of all, this is just your cheap eat in k-town, so I never expected any service, and although I never skimp on tip, I'd definitely do at least 15% (realizing ppl do this for a living and need to be paid)
But this past Wed, the waitress was rude enough to DEMAND a 6 dollar tip, on a meal that was a little over 34 bucks
I had already given her 5 bucks tip (and to be honest, if I had change for a dollar, I prob would have given it to her anyway)
But before I could ask my roommate for another dollar, the waitress got completely rude and said, this must be at least 6 dollars tip! When my roommate heard the waitress actually demand a minimum tip from us, she simply refused b/c she was completely livid at the waitress's lack of propriety
I realize this is a cheap eat, so I shouldn't expect much, but yelling and demanding a minium tip on a 34 bucks meal? It's disgusting
I will never go back there again, and for anyone else's sake, I hope you don't either
unless you want to be yelled at by some waitress who does nothing but sit back and collect her minimum tip without giving you any service for it
Pho 32 isn't the place to bring to impress a date
However, it's a great place to grab a bite to eat
Pho 32 is really cute with clean, fun, simplistic decor
For an average of $14/person you can get a really good dinner
My personal favorite is the Spicy Beef Bowl with rice
Not every night out has to be finished off with creme brulee
This place is perfect for those times when you just want Jello
Tip: No real need to make reservations as the guest rotation is fairly quick here
This place is not that bad (but I didn't say it was fabulous either
) Quick, inexpansive, and acceptable decor services
I go here often for Pho and sometimes Shabu Shabu with friends
The food is great, the service quick and friendly and they have 2-for-1 drinks during happy hour (which ends at 7 pm--not sure when it starts)
A great place for a quicky, cheap bite to eat
The Scene The first venture between culinary titans Todd English (Olives, Figs) and Jeffrey Chodorow (Asia de Cuba, China Grill) is a suitably grandiose experience
With a cavernous, modern dining room and swank subterranean lounge, the restaurant screams serious dining
Black-clad servers also add to the stylish and mature atmosphere
Some diners might be surprised to learn that this is an all-you-can-eat, family-style affair
The Food English is Italian's signature food fest costs $39 per person and includes numerous shared plates of antipasti, pasta, meat and fish
Dishes change often; typical items include tagliatelli with savory duck ragu, creamy wild mushroom risotto and roasted branzini
Quality is hit-and-miss, and with so many flavors--most diners end up trying around nine dishes
Not included in the set price are homemade desserts like rich ricotta cheesecake and refreshing sorbets
The lengthy, surprisingly affordable wine list is sectioned by price, with bottles starting at $25
my company came here for lunch for restaurant week
i like it because its easy to get lunch reservations and they can accommodate large groups (we had 8 people)
service is nice and unobtrusive
there isnt anything special about the dcor, but the restaurant does have very high ceilings (good for the claustrophobics among us)
we had come here 6 mos ago for the last restaurant week and the menu was pretty much unchanged
they start you off with a warm bread basket with filled with garlic bread and olive oil dipped foccacia
we tore into it right away and asked for a second one
for appetizers, we had a choice of arancini (fried risotto stuffed with cheese), salad, yellow tomato gazpacho, and bruschetta
i had tried the arancini last time (hot rice oozing cheese) so this time i opted for the gazpacho with crab ravioli
the soup was tart, cool, and refreshing on a summer day
the crab ravioli was also very good a thin fried wrapper filled with cold crab meat
for entrees, we had a choice of ricotta ravioli, half a roast chicken, vegetable panini, or salmon
half the table chose the salmon half the table chose the ravioli
the salmon was very good grilled so the skin was crispy and salty, atop what seemed to be some type of green vegetable (maybe pea?) reduction
it also came with some baked fingerling potatoes
i didnt try the ravioli, but my coworkers said it was very good
portions were extremely generous
for desserts, we had a choice of sorbet, gelato, or cookies
half of the table got the gelato (spiced chocolate maple) whereas the other half got the sorbet (rhubarb melon)
both the gelatos the sorbets were good, but nothing extremely special
with wine coffee, and including tax tip, our bill came out to about $320 for 8 ppl, which wasnt bad for the amount of food that we got
Went with a big group and had a wonderful meal
The waiter was friendly and efficient
The decor was GREAT, loved the upstairs bar/lounge
My only complaint was the hostesses didn't see us standing in front of them for 5 mins
VERY COOL downstairs lounge and private room/wine cellar

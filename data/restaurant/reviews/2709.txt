Just the right amount of evrything
No component overpowers the other
The pie is thin and crispy - never burnt
I swear this is good stuff
The owners may have had to relinquish the name Patsy's - but a name isn't all that important when you bite down and say AHHHHH GRIMALDIs! If you love olives, go for it
they are cured in oil and deelish!!!! Added benefit: the cannolis!!! They are handmade by the owner's wife and boy are they good!! And, please don't forget to take a stroll down to the promenade (by the River Cafe) afterwards for an extra treat! You will be satisfied!
I am a pizza addict
I have been to pretty much every top notch pizza place in the city
Grimaldi's (Patsy for some of us still) is the best in the city
Hands down! Lombardi's is good, but not quite as good as Grimaldis
The crust, the cheese, the SAUCE, all so incredible
I have been going there for the past 10 years and I always walk out knowing I just ate the best pizza in NYC
To make it even more enjoyable, take a walk one sunday morning across the Brooklyn Bridge to build up a nice hunger
If thin crust is what you like, this a must!
There is some tradition to waiting in line, but if you come by 5:00 on a week day you get seated right away and don't feel rushed
I went to Grimaldi's on a Monday afternoon around 4:45 and waited outside the restaurant for almost an hour before being seated
It's true that the pizza comes fast because it cooks so quickly
I had a sausage pizza and it wasn't soggy
It was fresh, but it could have been more flavorful
I felt that I could have skipped the trip over to Brooklyn and found much more flavorful pizza in Manhattan
I wish I had listened to the few people that have said the truth about this place
I was born and raised in NYC and finally decided to visit this pizzeria with such wonderful recommendations
I was disappointed
The pizza is not that good
It was simply ok
I did like the black charcoal charred crust--nothing cooks a pizza like a brick oven--but the sauce was bland
My paper napkin probably had more flavor and better texture than the unappetizing gobs of mozzerella
This is really tourist trap destination
One reviewer said he has had better pizza from random dive places in the city
Amen to that
My wife and I are from New York and recently moved to Kentucky
We made a 12 hour trip up north just to go to Gramaldi's
What an awesome place!!
Not only the best pizza in NY, but also the best skyline view of Manhattan right down the street
The service is also fast, like New York is, and it takes only about 4 minutes to cook a pie
This is definitely the best pizza in NYC
I take all of my out of town friends here for pizza and they all love it
I just can't eat one pie when I get there
I need at least one just for myself
I can't see how anyone can even write a negative view on this place because not only is the pizza great, but the staff there is really nice
The only thing I can say negative and I don't even think this is negative, but the lines are pretty much always out the door
That should tell you how good it is that there's even a line
Now residing in Chicago, the only quality pies are the deep dishes, which I do like
But the best pies belong to Brooklyn, especially Grimaldi's! I wish these guys can FedEx their pizzas nationwide
I love this place
Anytime I have family or friends in town I have to take them here for a real taste of NYC pizza
My boyfriend will even ask me to stop on my way home to pick up a pie
I'll call and order as I get on the Brooklyn Bridge and it will be ready when I get there
The only bad thing is they don't have a salad
Best pizza in town! And check out that view while your waiting in line!!!
Listen, the pizza is all right
Not all that it's cracked up to be
Most of the time it is soggy, and it's not becasue of the wet ingredients
It's becasue the crust is sooo thin and all the toppings are weighing it down
I'm not saying the pizza is awful
It's tasty
But it's definately not the best
I would reccomend giving it a try though
This was the best pizza I have ever tasted
We also tried Original Ray's in Manhattan and there was no comparison
I tried all the so called best pizza places in New York
Grimaldi's is the best
Take one home and reheat it, it's even better when the crust get's crispier
The pepperoni and onion is the best combo
Grimaldi's is the best pizza my husband and I have ever eaten
Took advice and stayed away from wet toppings - it was incredible
Charming atmosphere, quick service, excellent food, great value - the perfect place! We took to park to eat and then walked the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan-an unforgettable experience
I'll recommend to all my friends and will return to repeat the whole experience
I read some of the reviews and must laugh
This pizza is the best
I have almost never got a burnt or soggy pie
Its coal people expect so black on the bottom
If you don't want soggy then be smart and don't order mushrooms and onions and peppers
And remember don't use sauce its fresh tomato
You have to know what your saying
Less is more as far as taste goes
Like pop says never eat in a empty restaurant
10 years going to Grimaldi's is still the best
I'll be back
P
S
I heard they're opening more than 1
GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!
This is the best pizza in town, the ingredients are so fresh, and even if you don't like anything on your pizza try the sausage, garlic or peppers
There is a reason this place is so good and its freshness
I have never been so disappointed in NYC! The pizza is really bad here, maybe it used to be the best, but now it is not different at all from the average Manhattan pizza
which for italian standards is bad
Nice family place, nice atmosphere, but don't go there for pizza
It is definitely NOT good
Our two families walked from Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge on a sultry evening on the promise that this would be the best pizza we ever had
Well, it wasn't the best, as my vermont cheddar/mussell pizza is the best, but it was darn close
Savoring the thin crust under the Frank Sinatra wall made it even more delicious
Dont be daunted by a line outside - we were in with a party of 7 in 15 minutes
After the pizza, the walk back into the city was dessert
Cab fare from the Village was $11
The people on here who knocked Grimaldi's have no idea what they're talking about
You definitely shouldn't try to go at a peak time -- between 5:30 and 8 PM most days of the week, esp
during the summer
And toppings are not the best way to go here, and if you do, choose wisely -- it is a very thin crust that can't support much more than the fine sauce and sublime cheese it already has
Beyond that, it is the best, hands down, with no comparison to Lombardi's or John's

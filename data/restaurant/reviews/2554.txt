Big value size food
I've been to Carmines few times, and Olive Garden few times
I like Olive Garden better now
They include 15% tip because many tourists who doesn't know about tip go there
The service is better than most of the restaurants in the city
I went to the Olive Garden for the first time a few months ago, and the food was ok
The entree soup was phenomenal, but the food was just ok
I would have paid the price that I paid just for the entree soup by itself
But again, the food was just ok
Service was another thing
Service was also good, considering that the place was crowded, the server served us properly, and offered us more soup
again, the main plate was just ok
150 words max
oops
too little space!
Apparently a norm at Olive Garden to be charged a dining-in surcharge and a tip when ordering on take-out food
Also the norm to include the tip of 15% on the bill total
Only at Olive Garden
The food is amazingly deliscious and fresh and the views of the city are breathtaking!! A must go especially if you are in Times square
Great food, service and setting! I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy authentic Italian food at amazingly resonable prices (considering the location)
Check it out!
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you
I'm not a coffee expert
it all tastes the same to me
When I go to starbucks I don't even know what Grande, Latte etc
means
But their coffee is ok, and they have couches and stuff so you can hang out and drink coffee
pretty cool I guess

I do find it interesting that many of those who find Starbucks expensive are also the same who order Large Triple caramel mocha fraps
I hear the surprise almost every time I wait in line for my 1
79 cup of coffee
Just lay off the dessert and order a cup of coffee

Serves good turkey sanwiches, too
Food is ok, nothing I'd recommend to friends
The service was snotty
When my companion asked for salt, the waitress responded it's amazing what you can find if you just look - pointing to the salt shaker on the table
Rude, unprofessional, and completely unecessary
Doubt I'd ever return
Have a great selection of foods
it's hard to make up your mind
Have amazing BLTs
A fun atmosphere with delicious, familiar food
Be prepared for a bit of a wait, but not for too long
I've been there 3 times with different friends and they all love the place
I always have the tiny mac'n cheese, of course can do this to often or I regret it next time I try putting on my jeans!
I can't get enough of the sweet potato fries and the 110% veggie chili! I'm hoping next time I go I have enough room for dessert
As the name suggests, this flat iron brunch/restaurant place is a great place to eat and chat, and definitely be prepared to do some damage, the menu is great and so are the portions! Dont miss out on the mac n cheese!
Chat'N'Chew serves competent comfort food in a cozy atmosphere
The wait staff has been friendly every time I've been here (about a dozen) and generally attentive to you - refilling drinks promptly, etc
The portions are fairly large with some items, though, so definitely ask about that if you don't want a huge meal
I ordered a side of sweet potato fries that could easily have been enough for 4 people - and they were really darn yummy!  If you want a nice leasurely comfort with a close friend, I'd suggest this place
Fun restaurant offering good food at good prices
The decor resembles a back porch you'll feel right at home with the comfort food
The house special is the mac cheese it's wonderful! The desserts are homemade very yummy
i started going to chat and chew a few years ago and never had a problem, about a year ago i had the worst bloody mary ever there
but i decided to give the place one more chance for brunch
sorry, i will never go back
the food was kind of gross, the eggs were kind of cold and the fries were just greasy, lets not even start on how disgusting, wet and greasy the bathroom floor was, i almost fell on my way to the toilet!! it's unfortnate, thank god for them they have a conveinent location
Food is pretty good for the price an mac and cheese is nice and cheesy
Love that they offer just a small order to nibble on with main course
The restaurant doesnt look the greatest but the food is really good and satisfying
Service can be slow at times
I checked this place out and I was kinda let down
It was hot as hell in there
Granted everywhere was hot that day though
I got some steak sandwich which was run of the mill, and there was a staple in it
I let the waiter know and he offered me a free dessert
I didn't want one so he offered me a beer
I was with a date, and he gave me one free beer and we had to pay for my dates beer
I dunno
It was OK I guess, I never jugde a place on one visit, so I guess I would try it again
I have been to this place on a few occasions
Every time I go it's always great
If you have not been there, you need to go
This isn't a place to go if you are on a diet
This All-American nook is all about meat n' potatoes
The ambience is dress down, and the decorations are those of old pictures decorations that make it look like a diner from the past
The food is no-nonsense in portions and very flavorful for your taste buds
Great place to meet with pals and chow-down
As a southerner, I never thought I would ever find a BLT the size of Texas in New York City
My mouth almost dropped, and for good reason, when the server brought my sandwhich and side of macaroni
The word side always seemed to equate to a tasting or sample of something, but the macaroni came out in a sizzling crock pot fit for four
The food was great and the environment was fun
Reviews on this place were so mixed I was a little wary at first, but after eating there, I'm definitely pro Chat n Chew
While their veggie sandwich was slightly bland (that's what I get for ordering the healthiest thing on the menu), I shared a plate of amazing sweet potato fries, and finally tasted the famous/infamous mac and cheese, which is INCREDIBLE
I will need my own order of it next time
Words of caution before going here
The floor will always have a wet spot on your way to the restroom so watch your step
The meatloaf isn't as good as it should be but then again you can't beat the turkey
They have nice specials on drinks (i
e
two for one apple martinis)
The mac cheese is still pretty good (even though sometimes it's better than other times)
The desserts aren't the best
Their Salad de la Casa is nice though
Overall, it certainly is comfort food but at some uncomfortable prices
You'll walk out of there slowly adding the numbers in your head wondering, did I really pay that much for a hot dog with mac cheese?
This place has been a favorite of mine for quite some time
The Mac and Cheese is AMAZING
and soups, salads and sandwiches are yummy too! Ooh, and I recommend the Cupcake Cake for dessert
I've never had any problems with seating and the service has always been prompt and friendly!
Great food and service! During one extremely cold winter evening, the restaurant offered complimentary hot coca to warm up while we waited for a table
Large serving that is sure to be taken home for another meal
You will often quite a long time for a table here, but the comforts within are usually worth it
Highly recommend the macaroni and cheese
Portions are huge
Service is friendly
It's not all that cheap though
I think it all depends on when you go -- I've certainly had to stand on line here, waiting for a cramped table, only to find the service slow and food less than great
But if you hit CC offpeak, I suspect you can still do better and enjoy the comfort food classics and funky vibe that first put it on the map
The Scene The three rooms look as if Ralph Lauren might have designed them, with hunter green wainscoting, deep wood floors, ivory colored walls and warm mahogany accents
The entire space hums with excitement as power deals are made, daters connect and tourists thrill to a true New York dining experience
The servers, casual in their striped button-downs, anticipate and fulfill needs as if they were trained as mind readers
The Food Chef Michael Romano's seasonal menu draws on the local greenmarket to create fresh, classic crowd-pleasers
Perfectly sauced pastas are a sure thing, like exquisite ribbons of tagliorini dotted with garden-fresh English peas and savory gnocchi plumped with porcini, proscioutto and Parmesan
Meats, like a succulent, crispy lemon-pepper duck, are no less worthy
The gourmet take on the peanut butter cup encompasses the restaurant's philosophy best: take a familiar pleasure, then elevate it to delightfully delicious extremes
This was our first time to USC, we have been to their other restaurants, we loved this restaurant also
Make sure you make reservations well in advance
The service was excellent from waiting at the bar to our waitress
For us, there were so many apps to choose from
All of the food was excellent
All the great reviews are true, and we look forward to going back
I had dinner here with my boyfriend and had a wonderful time! The restaurant was pleasantly quiet, as quiet as it gets on a Saturday night
He started with the Tuna Tartar and I with the ravioli with garlic, ricotta, bread crumbs, lemon, and pecorino which was so scrumptious I couldnt help but say MMMM with every forkful
The lemon taste was so punchy, loved it! My boyfriend has the special which was a Cod with a assortment of stewed vegetables (tomatoes, corn) it was excellent! But it wasnt served with sides, so my boyfriend began attacking my tuna steak with wasabi mashed potatoes a vegetable salad or type of slaw
All very appetizing! Desserts left something to be desired I felt
The blueberry pie was so sugary sweet and there was not enough ice creeam to equalize that sugary, syrupy taste from the pie
All in all a VERY pleasant experience, we were not rushed at ALL!
We came here for dinner on my boyfriend's birthday and had a three course meal including coffee and liquors which worked out at approx $110 a head (plus tip)
Our waiter was charming and the service overall was excellent
We did not feel rushed at all and there was a good interval between courses

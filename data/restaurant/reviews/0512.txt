small place but when it's packed they could use more than two waitresses
Food is delicious, fresh and appealing
When your food comes the presentation is excellent and it's exciting to the eyes as well as your tastebuds
Location seems odd 179 street Jamaica but don't let that fool you
Parking in back
THE WAITERS ARE VERY RUDE AND THEY MAKE FUN OF THE CUSTOMERS IN THEIR NAVITE LANGUAGE VERY BAD RESTAURANT
AVOID IT
I've been here a few times now for lunch it's a bargain
You get 50% off all items (except drinks)
Who can beat that?!? The food was great very filling
I will definitely go back time time again
I love this place, especially the Tikki Masala
Service is a little slow, but they have live music and great food at a great value
I live close to this one and I love it
Almost all dishes are of the North Indian variety - so order some paneer
Definitely check out their 1/2 price lunch special, which I'm pretty sure exists at the Manhattan locations as well
The service is excellent, the paratha and nan are lovely, and when you specify your spice-level, they cook it that way, fairly consistently
My boyfriend and I each ordered simple pasta dishes here
Nothing fancy, but they were both below-average in taste and not worth the price
I won't be coming back here
I can't review the food because they won't deliver 8 blocks
It's too far! Bad way to do business!
Where shall I begin? I've given it four tries and each is more disappointing than the next
The garden is really god awful, the bread is inedible, the wine was really squeaky, and the music really atrocious
The waiter was pleasant and I thought how bad could someone screw up basic Italian food? I spoke too soon
A simple side order of broccoli was a bit overcooked but served plain, no sauteed garlic, no herbs, nothing
The spaghetti putanesca was an abomination: with thin spaghetti that was really unpleasant and the saltiest, most inedible sauce ever
Ever
I had to send it back
It returned this time improved -- same pasta, just less sauce
The only thing that was decent was the white bean/garlic dip and when I asked for more of that (to put on the pasta) I was informed We have no more
Really appalling
This is probably one of the best places to eat in Greenpoint
Dishes are rich, filling
And the tiramisu!! If you go for anything, definitely go for that! Fettucine Pescatore Red Snapper dishes are my favorites!
This is the best restaurant in Greenpoint! It is run by a small family; the husband cooks, the wife is the waitress, along with the son who helps out at the register
It's not that big on the inside, maybe 15 tables, but it's usually not that crowded, so they can take larger groups  They have the best flatbread pizza I have eaten since Itlay and the prices are super reasonable
With the best brunch in Brooklyn (and huge omlettes for $4) Also, and most importantly, they have (and I have tried it all over the city to compare) THE BEST tiramisu IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!  I am sad to let the secret out
Eat here! You won't regret it!
This place is reminiscent of any Minados or Todai's for the abundance of food, for the sub-par service, and the pricey value
The atmosphere like any expensive buffet is crowded, noisy, and plenty of lines
The food on the other hand is delicious in some areas (Peking Duck + Buns, Oysters, Grilled Fish, Soups), satisfactory in some (sushi, cold dishes) and terrible in others (dim sum, desserts)
What was by far the most terrible however, was the service
It was rushed, it was rude, and it was ridiculous
While it seems like it may be a hit or miss place, it is at least worth trying once
This buffet has a great selection of a variety of differetn foods in amany cuisines
THere is a good Sushi bar, a roast duck/ham/prime rib, grilled foods, and literally undreds of differetn dishes
The food would not be considered the highest in quality, but the variety more than makes up for it
Although expensive, this is a place that we go to often
I never heard of EB before but I was surprised later to see positive reviews
By the decor I thought I was going to have a great dining experience
Marble stairs, fancy chandelers, etc
The food selection was a little better than average but this place gets a big F in quality
Pretty much all the hot food was bordeline cold, definitely not hot
This makes it hard to judge the taste
I tried several dishes but most were either cold or just not that good
Annoyed by my meal I really wanted to get out of this place
Oh yeah this place is far from cheap given the quality, and it is in Queens
$22 bucks per/p + service charge+tip
I complained to the manager but he was rude and didn't really care
I think he forgets he's in the hospitality business
THIS IS GREAT RESTAURANT
I HAVE ENJOYED DINNER SEVERAL TIMES AND KEEP GOING BACK
I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS THE FOOD THE WAITRESSES OR THE BEER
THE ROOM ITSELF REMINDS ME OF BEING IN EUROPE, THE FOOD IS SUPERB, PORTIONS GENEROUS AND THE SERVICE IS GREAT
I WAS SERVED BY DARINA AND MONIKA TWO SPECIAL PEOPLE
THE BEER IS ALWAYS FRESH
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE STARO-PRAMEN BEER, NECTAR OF THE GODS
NOT EASILY FOUND IN NYC
We were very impressed with the food and value
The food is perfect for a cold winter night and the cabinessence is warm and cozy
You must try the garlic soup!
Wow this place was a great find
The service is imperresive the food sepectacular and the atmosphere romantic
We ate a couple of Tapas there which were Shimp in garlic, Calamar in garlic and as a main dish I ate a Seafood combination in a creamy lobster cava sauce and my date ate a wonderful Tilapia in a butter lemon and white wine sauce
For dessert the waiter reccomended his favorite which was a Torreja
Overall Wonderful experiance
It's a great romantic restaurant with outstanding food! Avarage price: $40 p

On a casually friday night, my boyfriend and I wanted some authentic Spanish food, so we decided El Boqueron
As soon as we walked in we were greeted very friendly by the manager
Later, we ordered a pitcher of sangria, as a result it was the best sangria we had ever drank
We didn't know what to order so the kind waiter suggested a few of his favorites
They were all great
At the end of the meal we ordered a crema catalana which brought about a dance show
All together it was delightful and an unforgetable night
El Boqueron is very romantic, the service is extroardinary, and the food is mouth watering
They really go out of their way to please you
Everyone is very pleasant and treat you like royalty- which brings me to the subject of prices- maybe a bit pricy compared to most restaurants in astoria but you get way more then you pay for! May I also add the desserts are excellent- I don't have a sweet tooth so I hardly ever eat dessert but I will never pass it down when I'm here
You usually don't need reservations but my boyfriend and I went there on Valentines Day with reservations and had to wait a bit
so I would reccommend making rezzie's on holidays
Overall- excellent and lucky to have in Astoria! If this place was in the city it would be 4 times as expensive for what they have to offer
Walking up to the place, we had no idea how much room there was inside
I hadn't had tapas in years and my boyfriend never had, so we went with one of the maaaany specials the waiter listed for us, a seafood combination
While not the best seafood ever, it was flavorful and simple
We also had a couple items from the tapas menu that were just completely satisfying
The service was impeccable, and they seemed excited to encourage us to return because they gave us complimentary sherry at the end of the meal
The sangria was very refreshing and did the trick
Good quiet place for a date if you don't care that the walk-up includes a great view of the N train
It may not be a cheap date, but it's better than the prices at tapas places downtown

They had a cancellation and were happy to seat us in the main dining room
Dinner was EXCELLENT
Ravioli w/ braised veal and leek butter, fried lettuce and zucchini blossoms w/ a cioppollini dipping sauce, divine
The LARD to spread on the bread is my favorite delicacy, and the treats after dinner, the dessert bites brought to the table gratis were wonderful
Service was professional, courteous and accommodating
The doorman, Gary, a British fellow is fabulous
He even finds you a parking space and walks you to your car w/ an umbrella
The portions are not huge, but enough
We are looking forward to our 3rd visit to Del Posto
Del Posto is a romantic spot or a place that you can dine w/ a crowd
It is worth a visit or two!
The atmosphere was amazing, servce was outstanding, food not worth the price
Gnocci in pesto tasted as if the entire salt shaker had been spilled
Waiter was not to concerned with my comment
The antipasto was for 3 people and there was barely anything on the plate
Cookies at the end of the dinner was a nice compliment
The rest of my party of 6 were not impressed with the food either
Let me start out by saying I was excited for this meal
When we walked in for a big closing dinner, the group I was with awe struck by what Del Posto looks like
It is amazing looking
We spent some time at the bar and the bartender was very attentive allowing us to try some of the featured wines and vodkas
The bar scene was spectacular
That's where the best part ended
We found the food to be average at best, the portions were extremely small and the service was horrible
At one point in the dinner, the gentleman serving the drinks was unsure of which drink had the orange vodka and he actually stuck his nose in the drink to smell it
Pretty laughable considering this place is known for its class
The overall service was pretty poor and food was not worth the trouble
Would not go back again as it did not meet the hype
After reading the reviews on Del Posto, I knew NOT to order any of their entrees
We stuck with their Anitpasta's and Pasta's and were very happy
while the portions aren't huge (but decent), they are packed with flavor and are beautifully presented
If you are a heavy eater, then order more pasta! This place is good for lunch (when we went) and you will have no wait! While I hear this place is packed at night for dinner, it was less than 30% full for lunch, almost felt like we had the whole place to ourselves (up to you if you like that)
The service I want to add, was impeccable!!! We never mentioned it was my Dad's birthday
but I suppose somehow, our waiter overheard us and at the end of the meal we were presented with a Happy B-day dessert spread! Now that is attentive! The restaurant is one large room, with an upstairs, overlooking the downstairs
We agreed the best tables were in the corner on the main floor - so you can look out to the whole dining room, or upstairs along the railing - so you can look down on the whole restaurant
Just to aquaint you
I eat out alot!
This place is absolutely a fabulous experience! Yes it is expensive, but, you get what you pay for!!! From when you walk in, you feel like the large staff is there to welcome, greet, and make you feel like a top shelf customer! The somalier, will be glad to aquant you with the overwelming wine list
And what a great job he does!He split glasses of wine for us that were appropriate for each course! and explained why they fit the menu
The food is carefully perpared, and delicious!!! unusual pairings and fabulously put together! they take the time for the details
the wine glasses are gorgeous, the service is perfect, the dessert candy cart is delivered at the end just so you can indulge in a little bit of heaven, even if you do not order dessert
They will expalin in detail all you could ask for about the menu
top shelf!! i ADORE bATALI'S rein in meetpacking!!!
The restaurant is spacious and has a great bar, but for Mario that AIN'T going to cut it! I was on a date Last Thursday and figured it would be a good place to impress, lucky for me i had a good bar picked out for after dinner
I will geive credit - the calamari app was nice, but it was down hill from there
After taking 45 minutes to be seated with a reservation, the pasta with baby shrimp was bland and tastless, the bulb salad (two grilled onions on wilted mixed greens) was no better than the local Italian joint on every corner - but alas the entrees'
pork loin - was tastless, but more importantly was RUBBER, just awful! My date got the cod, which was totally ruined by the SALTY 1/4 inch layer of pesto on top and unknown foamy sauce on the plate
if you want Mario's food go to Lupa (always good) if you want italian, go ANYWHERE ELSE
dissapointing at best and for the price
enough to make me write this review!
Server Sean Toussaint suggested specials and specialties worth the $$$ price
Antipasti included a chefs treat of funghi fritti, a carrot sformato with the fresh taste of baby spring carrots and the mouth feel of a gelato, and a salad of green papaya
We shared the primi, a slow roasted wood pigeon served over chestnut ravioli
The signature grilled pork chop with cipolline and cardoon puree was what the other white meat marketers wished all America could fathom
With the help of Daniel Zwicke, we chose wines that were neither off-putting nor overly expensive
The Bastianich Tocai from Friuli was crisp and with its characteristic mineral notes complemented the appetizers
We experimented with some medium reds given the delicateness of the fish, the savory pork and the earthiness of the lamb we ordered an Irpinia Aglianico from Campania and a Bardelini Vermintino
Way better than the early reviews
Looking very much forward to going to Del Posto, we were disappointed having to wait for our table and then the bartender did not even serve us promptly, we had to wave him down after sitting for 5 minutes
The service once seated was very good and the food was good, but Babbo is just as good and the portions were pretty small
The petit fours were wonderful and the wine list outstanding
The atmosphere was wonderful too - loved the piano player! I am happy we tried it, but I am not dying to go back
Restaurant is great for fine group dining
Must order pasta with the main course
Quite expensive for its value, but worth going to once
Beautiful restaurant
Don't bother with dessert since a tray full of goodies are presented at the end of dinner
We had 6pm reservations and the place was pretty empty and we were told to wait and then other people came in right after us and were seated right away
Most of the menu is ala carte the pasta's were the only good thing on the menu
I had the 3 lamb which was not good 2 pieces of the lamb were too weird and gamey for me
My friend had the squab and said that it had no taste and was gamey and she is a food snob
For the prices the portions were disappointing
It's a shame b/c the ambience is beautiful and the service was very good
They need to rethink the menu
The best part was the doorman who saved me a spot for my car
parking is tough b/c of the FBI building
We love Batali, Lupa and Babbo are our favs, but this was extremely disappointing
After sitting, it took 30 mins to get a drink
Sausage app had little flavor, unbelievable that Batali would allow that on the menu
Spaghetti w crab and jalepeno was ok, but belonged at Otto
Ravioli was very good, but Pici seemed like Batali tried too hard to impress
But most disappointing was the $50 Barolo Risotto for 2
It was a runny pool of risotto in a plate way too large, very avg taste, horrible presentation
Bathroom had no hand towels, leaving me to dry my hands with TP
Babbo and Lupa are significantly better, and this place should redo the menu, or empty seats could become the norm
I hope Batali has not lost his touch, cause he is one of the best
My wife and I went to Del Posto this past Saturday and loved every minute of it
The atmosphere, staff and food were all great
I'd agree with others who say to stick with the pastas and skip the entrees -- it was the best pasta I've ever eaten
Expensive, but absolutely worth it
One of the best restaurants I've ever been to
If you love architecture as much as I do, this is a must see restaurant
But I must say that if you want fantastic food, you'd be wise to dine elsewhere
The bar menu (that mere mortals are given) is so limited that you'll find yourself looking into the half empty dining room wondering what it'd be like to taste the arugula salad the New York Times recently mentioned
Don't bother asking the pompous excuse for a waiter with the rooster hairdo for a taste of the arugula salad
He'll robotically tell you that there will be no arugula for you
Still I think it is fun to go here so my next visit will be strictly drinks only
And next time I'll go later than at 8 pm
Earlier than that I can tell you the place is virtually empty
After some deliberation, we concluded it was the lamps that really make the room seem

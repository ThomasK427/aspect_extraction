This is certainly a do-over restaurant - we will be back!
This place is on the 'gentrification boundry' but not for long
There are actually few nice 'date' places north of the L train where you can eat good food, seriously really good
This place is near Enids and Matchless, and not to mention McCarren Park
If you live in Greenpoint or on the border then this should be your dining prelude to the 'nice night out' in the neighborhood
The facade of this splendid, New American bistro belies both the excellent food and more than reasonable wine list contained within
Styled on a 50/60's diner, the eclectic decor uses many original artefacts but don't expect hot dogs or milk shakes
The dinner menu is varied enough to offer a wide enough choice for about everyone without over-extending itself
The service is attentive without being over-solicitious and the prices compare very favorably with Manhattan bistros offering similar fayre
The experience was well worth the trip
Conversation with the staff revealed that one famous New York maker has used the Park Luncheonette as a location for a soon to be released movie
No names mentioned but you talking to me?
The Park Luncheonette is just getting going as a New American restaurant after a long history as a lunch counter
The decor has not quite made the transition--some really nice artifacts are still there, but there are several layers of different remodeling efforts visible
The food is pretty good and the kitchen is still working out the details, but it all all looks promising
Think one each of meat, fish, duck, chicken, pasta, vegetarian (skip this)
A small place with a nice atmosphere for a casual date or neighborhood dinner and drinks
Good, small wine list
I just found out from Molto Mario's crew that Jody Williams no longer is at Gusto! Who can possibly replace her and where is she going?
we live down the street and have eaten here many times for lunch and dinner, and the food is consistently terrific
the dishes are simple combinations, but are incredibly flavorful
in particular, we love the (complimentary) radishes in toasted anchovies, the romaine and fava bean salad with pecorino, the pristinely fresh seafood combination appetizer, the fresh fried donuts, and the braised peaches in amaretto with mascarpone
we haven't ordered a dish that turned out to be mediocre, yet! and the service is reliable and consistent during the lunch hours
the wine list is great -- they serve my favorite prosecco of all time -- OMBRA
my first was by far the best and was the reason i returned with a lot of people another night, however i kind of regretted it second time around
this time i could see how the place was designed it made it kind of hard for the people working there to help
had to get the attention of the waiters by actually going up to them
unacceptable
but the food is great, waitress not very accomodating, seemed impatient with a lot of questions, something else i find unacceptable in a place like this
i will go back here cause the menu is so eclectic, im curious as to what other tastes are offered here
ambience too bright for my taste
PLUS the best wine can be found in the bar but they refused to sell us a bottle!! theyd only do it by the glass
truly annoying,
This place has excellent food, and you pay for it
No bargain, but a value; however, the cusine is undermined by bad service, and NOISE
This may be the noisiest restaurant in NYC
And when a waiter, in answer to a question by a diner, turns to another table and asks excuse me, do you know what this is? or responds to a request for a wine recommendation with it depends on what you're in the mood for, there are issues
At their price point, they need better service
We went on friday night, and it was my second time at this restaurant
Our hostess and the waiter were very polite, friendly, and cute, and we had the most comfortable and romantic dinner
The service was excellent, but in a way that was laid back, which I liked very much
Time that was allowed between each course was perfect, the bottle of Pinot Bianco recommended by our waiter was excellent, and of course, every dish was delicious and fresh
I highly recommend the stuffed and fried olive appetizer, tuna carpaccio, and bucatini
The olive appetizer was very delicious, even though normally I rarely eat olives ever!!! Could be noisy and crowded for dinner, and making a reservation is recommended
Welcoming hostess delicious homemade pasta gave false hope of decent dining experience
Gusto had been featured in Food Wine and the food did live up to the rating
However, our waiter disappeared as our entrees arrived
In a hooded sweatshirt, he walked by and casually waved ciao
His shift had ended and failed to transition to another waiter
Despite our look of confusion, he wished us ladies a great night and mentioned it was a pool tip setup
Other staff (not waiters) took plates away and tossed dessert menus on our tables in complete silence
I voiced my concerns to the manager whose only response was Oh, he must have made sure you were taken care of by somebody before he left, essentially disbelieving me
We were offered an arrogant smile with no apologies; no interest in prolonging the conversation since I interrupted him counting receipts
My coworkers and I tried out Gusto for a recent holiday dinner
The delicious food and beautiful restaurant was completely overshadowed by the most appalling service
We were seated 45 minutes after our reservation at a table for four crammed with 6 chairs
Our waitress pretty much ignored us, brought the food out at different times, never brought over salt or pepper and messed up two of our orders
Would not go back solely due to service
Too many restaurants to choose from (especially in that area now!) to bother with that again
Too bad- food was quite good
The food and ambience are nice enough, but the service here is appallingly bad for a restaurant that charges these prices
Our waiter was completely unfamiliar with the menu and did not bother to tell us that they were out of several items (even though we arrived at 7 pm on a Saturday night!) He then delivered three out of our four chosen entrees and todl us the kitchen made a mistake with the fourth entree and he would have to put in a new order for it (leaving the other three guests sitting with their entrees!) To add insult to injury, he gave our table the wrong bill and let a party of six walk out having paid the bill meant for our party of four
I agree with the review above - I would not return if they were giving out free meals
What really kills this place is the service
Waiter took forever to come once we were seated
Bread took forever to come
Finished my drink, and no one asked if I wanted another
Constantly saw others around us looking for their waiter (b/c I kept doing the same thing)
Service is just so slow, so it really throws off the pace of your meal
However, no complaints about the food
everything was above average, but not memorable
Glad I tried it once, but will not go back
Great atmosphere and concept, but after waiting for our reservations, front desk staff could not have been ruder, nor did they care
We walked out after waiting an hour
Terrific
Thoughtful food, flavors that stood out in their pure simplicity
The service was good, knowledgeable, although a newbie server, she knew her stuff
Other than a hostess trying to pull the if I stare you, you will get up so I can turn the table it was pretty recommendable
I'd go back [in fact, I will be going for lunch this week]
Don't miss the stuffed squash blossoms, fantastic with fragrant basil, ricotta and fried artichokes, which were potato-chip crisp on the outside yet tender, fleshy and sweet on the inside
Risotto with lemon, basil and parmesan-simple but intense
Signature meatballs with pine nuts and raisins in tomato sauce
Veal short ribs were among the best ever had
Salt cod in tomato with chick peas, wonderful
Dessert, a smooth, fragrant pistachio gelato
Light and fresh lemon panna cotta with berries
My tiramisu was a dense creamy concoction
divine
Great space
The menu us unusual
Bacalaw, Tripe, Pasta Con Sarda (pasta with Sardines)
Three slices fennel with anchovy on top is brought to the table
No bread
Other tables were given platters of bread on arrival, we had to ask
Shared the tripe as an appetizer
Delicious
He had the Pasta Con Sarda, a St
Joseph Day traditional dish
Very tasty but a small portion
I had the Limone Risotta which was good but a small portion

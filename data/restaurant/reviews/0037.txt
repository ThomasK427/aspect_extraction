In addition, the waitstaff seems insulted if you decide to skip an appetizer or dessert
It's near my office
so I now prefer take-out service
I had a great time watching the cooks do their thing in the open kitchen atmosphere
The food was excellent! We had the Margarita pizza, calamari appetizer, salmon entree and the tira misu for dessert
Service was prompt and the food came out in pefect timing
My friend liked the pizza so much that she kept it at the table until she finished the whole thing, by herself! I highly recommend!
The place is not your average restaurant--the brightness of the place kind of borders on the creepy side
The food was reasonably priced and tasty
All around, it's a good place to stop in if you're in the area--they also take 'dine out ny' vouchers
My only complaint--I've been there twice, and they haven't had the cheapest wine on the list both times--how convenient
New chef has really improved the food
Pizzas were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses
Definitely try the calamari, any pasta, or even the Sliced steak entree
Definitely worth the trip if you are in the mood for a casual lunch or dinner
Noisy, rushed atmosphere and truly mediocrefood
The pizzas aren't bad, but the entrees and pasts are oily, too salty and NOT a good example of Napolitano cuisine
Skip it, unless someone else is paying
Last fall, I took the time to enter a negative review of Naples 45, based on a business luncheon (18 people) I hosted there
It has now been removed TWICE, although my comments were honest, non-insultive and intended to assist others in evaluating this restaurant
Naples now has a 9
1 rating, and I can tell you that, after spending 2
5 hours and almost $700 being ignored and mistreated by the rude waitstaff, I would still like others to know to avoid this place

If you have been to Italy and like Italian style, healthy, tasty and full of fresh produces pizza, Naples 45 is THE place to go to
It's a hidden heaven
Their pasta and finocchio salad are excellent too
The Scene You won't blink twice at the restaurant's spartan decor: As the packed crowds and critics' praises wallpapering the front wall agree, this longtime local favorite is truly one of the area's most exquisite finds
The Food New Green Bo's juicy pork or crab shau lon bau (soup dumplings) attracted much attention when they were first discovered by mainstream food critics several years ago
But other comfort foods are also superb: Scallion pancakes are delectably crispy yet chewy, and chow fun with shredded pork and preserved cabbage (it's not on the menu) offers a tangy rice-noodles retake on the usual lo mein
The pork with salty vegetables soup is simple yet savory, and seafood lovers must try the tender fried yellow fish, made aromatically briny with dried seaweed
Top off your meal with flaky, not-too-sweet red bean pastries
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke
I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab
The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice
Of course, it is crowded but who cares
Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York
So the place is usually pack full of people
Magazines articles and newspaper prints all stick onto the glass window tells you how tasty their stuff is
I only enjoy the buns they steam there but many people thinks it's tasty
Though from my experence the service was bad
I had ate there many times
So one day the women had the nerve to tell me that she's out of certain food when it's just right behind her
She don't even bother with the takeouts sometimes
Ever since that, I'm not going back no more
One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown
Was reading other reviews and thought -- if all you order is chow fun then of course it's greasy and awful (and not even Shanghainese)
agreed, the ambience is lacking
But the traditional items -- yellow eel, eggplant, mock chicken/duck, fried juicy buns, etc
(which most tourists don't order) -- are prepared with traditional flavor, harboring a semi-sweet, juicy taste
Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out
Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there
From the moment I tasted the soup dumplings I was hooked!! They are soooo tasty! Haven't found better dumplings anywhere else in NYC
You have to give it a try ! Don't let the ambiance of this place fool you, the food is far better than many pricey establishments
The Ginger beef is so delectable! Chicken with Mixed vegetables is an explosion of flavor, many great spicy dishes too
I have tried many things from the menu and have never been disappointed, everything is always delicious ! And it won't put a dent in your wallet ( also when you are done with dinner go across the street to the Chinatown Ice Cream factory for dessert !!)
Okay, so I never write but there doesn't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown
I live on the street this place is on
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance
And the soup bombs here, lovingly called Pork Dumplings with Soup (ha!) are an experiance
Wonton dough filled with gently steamed and seasoned pork are common but add this amazing soup to the wonton, seal it and serve it steaming hot and the dumpling becomes new again
this place is amazing for those dumplings alone but try the wine chicken and the scallion pancakes as well
i think this place could use a lil decor in the restaurant since the food is not really all that to begin with
tastes like any other chinese food in chinatown to me!! and the chinese broccoli? no flavor!! how hard is it to stir fry chinese broccoli and yet gave it no seasonings what so ever!! hmm
and who is this person that wrote the editorial review above? their review does not do any kind of justice whatsoever
This restaurant was way overhyped
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily
Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary
I've been coming to Green Bo since they've opened
I eat their at least twice a week
I see this place has some mixed reviews from this site, but I know for a fact that this place has quite a cult following
I think it's a great meal at a great value
A lot of the other places are overhyped with food that isn't that great
You know the food here is always fresh because their lines are always out the door
I also love how I can get lychee ice cream directly across the street after my meal
Lychee ice cream is the perfect thing after eating the Su Long Bow at Green Bo
Also try their hot and sour soup and scallion pancakes
Excellent dumplings
Standard dishes available is most Chinese restaurants, such as Sesame Chicken, were distintively prepared and flavorful
I also had the chance to try some unusual items, like jellied jellyfish and crispy eel
Terrific portions and a great value
The first time I went to NGB I ordered a few authentic Shanghainese dishes such as soup dumplings and pork shoulder
They were all pretty ordinary at best, but figured maybe I ordered the wrong dishes
The food was not at all authentic Shanghainese but since NGB had so many great reviews and everyone around me was Caucasian I decided I'd come back some other time to try their American-Chinese food
I've been there an additional 2 times since and honestly feel that if you want average American-Chinese food with the FEEL of authentic Chinese food (via location, decor, and various menu items, i
e
bok choy) then this is the place for you
While there are some Shanghainese dishes on the menu, go to Yeah Shanghai or Shanghai Cuisine (Bayard?) for more authentic Shanghai dishes (Drunk chicken, eel dishes, stir fried rice cakes, braised pork shoulder
)
Went to the restaurant based on many favorable reviews
This is NOT authentic Shanghai cuisine
It's not even good basic Chinese food
There are no Chinese customers in this restaurant, but many tourists
That should be glaring warning to stay away
Many Chinese restaurants will import a top chef to open the restaurant, working the first 6 months to a year to build up hype
This was probably the case here
Everything we had was bland, over soy sauced and swimming in oil
The price was very low and the service was harried
The soup dumplings were quite ordinary

I have had the delightful opportunity to dine at Da Marino's and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting or living in New York
My friend I discovered DaMarino's by accident in 1997 and have made it our first stop for dinner every time we visit the city
We have recommended this restaurant to all our friends who plan on going to NYC
The ambience is quaint and reminiscent of my trips to Italy
My favorite dish is the salmon alla grilla
This is a must for anyone looking for true Italian cuisine
My fiance and i first went there for dinner on a recommendation from a friend 2 years ago when we were visiting from LA
We ended up staying until 2 am
Now, we live in New York and take EVERY person who visits us there for dinner
The pasta's the best I've had outside of Tuscany and the owner loves to croak out lounge and Italian folk songs in a thick accent while his staff dances and jokes with customers
the food's unbeatable and the atmosphere is like a small family-run trattoria in Montepulciano
A dark and intimate environment leant to a romantic evening where we were treated like preferred customers or members of the family
It was sensational
I went for the price, but I keep going back for the FOOD!
Enjoyed myself so much I went back again with different friends
It was great, again
The food is delicious
The spaghetti sides are a little smaller than I would have anticipated, but the taste is so amazing that this could be the reason you are left wanting more
The red snapper with tomatoes, capers and olives was almost melted in my mouth
For me the best is the house salad
I don't know who makes the dressing, but I would bottle it
Try the vanilla ice cream, its worth it even if you are bursting at the seams
Again, another great experience
and yes, more kisses from the manager!
In Short A pit stop for visitors traveling between the hood and Broadway theaters and a popular spot for locals to fuel up before hitting the Hell's Kitchen bars, the interior is anchored by a large bar surrounded by black tables, chairs and booths
Colorful Mexican artwork dots the walls
The small menu features enchiladas, burritos, tacos and the restaurant's ever-popular margaritas, concocted from the restaurant's signature mix
Tacocina is a great place to dine for upscale Mexican food with different variations on traditional dishes combined with great service and decent prices
The portions for some of entrees (enchiladas + mole chicken for example) are enormous
Their drinks are similar, towards the front of the restaurant some of the biggest margaritas in all of Hell's Kitchen are made there, enough to host a school of fish
The actual restaurant is only a mere two doors down from its take-out counterpart, Tacocina Express
Delivery is as decent as the restaurant, except the items are premade for fast delivery
I've eaten both here and the Tacocina Express a few doors down
The TaExpress offers some of the best dinner specials around as far as value for the money (But as they have no seats you need to take it home) I think both places share the same kitchen
Overall good food and big poritions make a great value
TaCocina (not to be confused with sloppy steam-tray Mex takeout TaCocina Express two doors down) has a nice black-wood-and-adobe tile design to it--it supports the sophisticated take on Mexican favorites their kitchen serves
Portions are huge
The Mole sauce (a big litmus test for authenticity) is appropriately rich but not adventurous
Tamales are robust
The waitstaff seems overextended (based on 3 visits)
Note the first basket of chips (and zippy salsa) is free, the rest will cost
Service was great, drink specials were good and food was delicious
Definately recommend it
I love this Irish Pub because it is authentic and everyone there is so pleasant and entertaining
I must admit that the bartender Jerry is my personal daytime favorite! Oh yeah, the food is great too! Definitely check out this 8th Ave delight
The burgers, along with most of the fare there, are freshly prepared and very well presented
One always feels as though they have found their home away from home when visiting
In Short This branch of Bombay Palace, situated directly across from '21', is ornately decorated, with a crystal chandelier, dark wood panelling, and a large tank of tropical fish overseeing the proceedings
The extensive menu of largely Northern Indian cuisine includes lobster masala, tandoori trout and stuffed baby eggplant
Several prix fixe menus are available as well, offering dishes like clay-oven Cornish hen and lamb kebabs, as well as a vegetarian thali dinner
My father-in-law recommended this restaurant after I had arrived in the city for the summer
I was craving aloo gobi and roti, but found another dish that tickled my fancy; chicken vindaloo
To warn anyone out there that has not had this dish, its hot, very hot
However, it is hot in manner that is not pure pepper or temperature
The spices which season this dish are subtle but combine to make a powerful statement
The chili and peppercorns did not overwhelm the cinnamon and cumin
It was wonderful
I cooled my palate down with a nice mango lassi
I have been back twice and have found the food to be always consistent
My sister and I went there for an early dinner after visiting the MOMA yesterday
We ordered the prefix (?) meal, since it was between 5 and 7pm, but we had to ask for the menu when we sat down
First thing is the restaurant was FREEZING
My sister asked the waiter if they could raise the temperature a little, but he said the building is centrally located in another location in the building
The waiters were cordial, as well as the manager, but not very welcoming
The place is definitely glamorous looking, but everything looks so old and dated
The music that was playing reminded me of some old saloon scene, totally clashing with the decor and the large fish tank with exotic fish
Overall, the food on the prefix meal were great, but not as amazing as what other reviews have reported
The manager did bring over an additional dish of something lentil on the house, but we're not sure if this is commonly included
It was actually better than the 2 lamb dishes we had, though they were very good as well
Overall, the food was very good, but no different than some other cheaper Indian restaurants in the city
The restaurant's website says the prefix is $19
99, but it's really $29
99
No biggie, just that it could seem like they're unfairly trying to lure people in on the website with false information
Sounds like the buffet and dinner are amazing, so we may try that some other time if we're in the area
but to be honest it didn't leave me dying to go back
If you do go? Bring a jacket!
Well sat March 4th i decided to go here with my friends
The day started horrible and also ended the same way
A lot of crazy things went on as it was close to my sisters wedding, so all craziness I took them 45 mins to seat us down
i was about to flip out and leave
it gets worse
bad service/ and took forever to get food
NOT GOING BACK
The first thing I noticed about Bombay Palace is their amazing interior decorations, probably the finest I've seen in any Indian restaurant
The prices are more than what most might pay, but they have to take into consideration where this place is located (midtown Manhattan)
The service has always been quite decent, quick to deliver results and attentive at all times
While I've only had their buffet (which was fabulous), I'm told this place offers an even better dinner that is consistently ranked amongst the best in NY, if not the nation
The food from the buffet was incredible, the basmati rice is some of the best I've had, the palak paneer (spinach + potatoes) was delicious as well
I think they're mini-samosas (bite sized) are delicious and are well coupled with the rest of the their food options
As a very frequent traveler and a great fan of Indian food, I visit this Bombay Palace since 1989
I know all other Bombay Palace restaurants of the world wide Bombay Palace chain and with the flag ship in Kuala Lumpur, having won 3 consecutive prices as the best in Asia outside India (and believe you me Malaysia is known for good food!) this New York restaurant is the top in Indian Food
Especially the buffet lunch is of the greatest quality in the city
I have been there counting more than 23 dishes to choose from with all having outstanding quality over the years
The staff is great and recognizes their regular customers with great courtesy! Highly recommended!
Bombay Palace lived up to the great reviews I read online before trying the restaurant tonight
I live in Vegas and was in NYC on business, so very glad I took this site for it's word
Upon my arrival, I met the GM who was seating people
I told him that I read it was #1 for Indian and he gave me his personal guarantee
Not only that, but Mr

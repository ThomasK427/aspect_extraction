One thing that cannot be forgiven is the lack of good service in both dining in and delivery for the restuarant
Each time they have screwed up my order, with my burger being too rare after insisting medium and the lack of cheese for my melted cheese fries
Sad but true, they haven't been dependable each of the 3 times I've been there
nice atmosphere
the food is great and the price is right
although is gets crowded, that's my problem
i need to figure out when the off peak hours are, so that i can get my food super quick
There's no doubt this is the best bagel place in Astoria, with a great selection of flavors and toppings
The only issue is the bagels far too big - they are not traditional bagels
Most of the time this means they're chewy on the outside but barely cooked on the inside
I recommend toasting any bagel you get here, unless it's clear that they're overcooked on the outside (as it sometimes is)
Otherwise, though, the texture of the bagels is very nice, and their fresh-made cream cheeses are excellent
The store is always very crowded, though, and getting your bagels can be a little chaotic, so have a little patience if you go
I love it here - especially their bagels with oats and raisins
Their chicken salad and egg salad is great
It's often crowded, but they move quickly and have never gotten my order wrong
The only thing is that there isn't enough seating sometimes
I wish they would open another location so this one is less crowded!
these bagels remind me of the ones my father would bring home from NYC to long island when i was little
they are perfect!!!!!!
Bagles here are very chewy, well flavored and cream cheese spreads are very nice
I personally think Bagles in Manhattan can be tough, but not here
Freshly baked ones are like French Baguettes you get in Paris
:) There are only 6 or 7 tables and can be crowded
The bagels at Brooklyn Bagel Coffe Company are the best bagels around
Not to mention that the chicken salad is outrageous!!!!! The store is always kept clean and the atmosphere is always inviting and friendly
I love the bagels so much that I look forward to my shopping sprees in Astoria because I know I can have a great and satisfying breakfast and or lunch
I live in New Hyde Park and I wish the bagels were half as good! :)
I have been going to Brooklyn Bagel Coffee Co
for both breakfast and dinner since they opened their doors in Astoria
They have the best tasting bagels in Queens and offer a clean, inviting environment that makes you want to come back again and again
I strongly recommend the bagels and spreads, especially the loxspread!
I've been eating in this place every day for the past year and a half
The food is excellent , very fresh and tasty
The atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming
Although the prices are a little high for an area like Astoria, the quality and neatness of this place definitely pays off
The Scene There's little to visually distinguish Soul Spot from any number of hole-in-the-wall joints in New York, aside from its cleanliness
The small space has just enough room for three tables in front of the counter area, which displays most of the menu behind plexiglass; diners pick up their order from there, or take it to go
The Food The food, however, is a different story
The standard soul food menu is on offer, but the execution is anything but average and the servings are generous (each main course comes with two sides for less than $10)
Chicken and dumplings practically melt together in a delicious, chewy mush
Salmon and catfish are crisp and flaky
Sides are excellent: Cinnamon-spiced yams taste like a dessert item, and collard greens are much fresher than usual
If you still have room, there's superb coconut lemon pie, peach cobbler and more
I have only been here once and I went based on the glowing reviews from Citysearch
I was a little disappointed
The smothered chicken was nothing special--the gravy tasted like it was out of a can
The mac and cheese is delicious, but not the best in the neighborhood
The service was great and the cornbread is really yummy
recently moved to the neighborhood and this was the first place my fiance and i hit for take out
have been going back since day one
its always consistent and a great value
its a great addition to the neighborhood
right around the corner to the smith restaurant row
love the mac and cheese !
This place sure aint fancy, but it sure does taste good! Service with a smile
Great addition to the neighborhood!
In Short The minimalist brick-and-steel decor of the massively popular, original Soho location has carried over to its offshoots in Manhattan and Brooklyn
Tribute gets paid to the restaurant's namesake with 10 kinds of rice and accompanying sauces that border-hop through Pan-Asian, Mexican, Italian and Middle Eastern cuisines
Rounding out the menu are a few special entrees, salads with a choice of seven dressings, and unusual sides like edamame humus and Mayalasian jerky
Most every dish at this DUMBO restaurant involves rice in some shape or form
While there's a strong Asian influence behind many of the plates, you can't pigeonhole the food into a single genre, as there are Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Italian and American dishes incorporated into this creative menu
Very inexpensive, service was a bit slow considering it was uncrowded, but the food was great
With all the rain lately I decided to order in
The spring rolls were delicious, the woman on the phone sincere and the delivery was quick
The thai salad was soooo good--it had hard boiled eggs, stir fried tofu, chicken, tomatoes, lettuce and a divine peanut sauce
For my entree I ate the stir fried eggplant with tofu
It was very good
My friend ate the pad thai and enjoyed it
Although I've never dinned inside the place looks like a whole in the wall, so it's best if delivered
This isn't a serious sit-down restuarant, and we usually do take-out
but for yummy Thai, I will take Thai Sesame over Tuk-Tuk, Joya, or Lemongrass grill anyday
What they lack in decor and a bar (sorry, no daquiris and margaritas), they make up for with quality Thai that is quite cheap
You aren't going to impress your 212 friends here, but if you are jonesing for Thai, stop by
This is one of my favorite places
The eggs benedict with crab cakes instead of the bread is the best
Great burgers, great entrees
Nice Staff, the garden is beautiful
We go back every few weeks and take people who are in form out of town
We have never been disappointed
Lovely, patio garden for brunch
Food was great-prices, also
They have chocolate bread that was delicious and unique
Nice-looking, contemporary restaurant with lots of seating
Attention to details, like fresh flowers and newspapers at the bar for individuals
Re-filled water and coffee  without asking
Last Sunday, my family (12 of us) had a small dinner party at FIVE FRONT and it was just simply wonderful
They could not be more accommodating from setting up the menu prior to us coming (which Patty, the owner had pre-printed) to serving us an impeccable meal
Everyone flipped over the crab cakes and striped bass
Everything was cooked to perfection
The desserts were to 'die for '!! The wait staff was always there and even with a group our size they were one step ahead of our every need
We left FIVE FRONT very full and with smiles on our faces!! We all agreed that we will come back!
There was no room in the garden (at 2:00 PM), but my date and I had a lovely view of the bridge from the back room
Brunch includes bread, coffee or tea, and the entree for $12
The cinnamon bread was yummy
I had the eggs benedict with salmon which was okay, and my date had eggs in a puff pastry which was delicious
Both came with flavorful home fries
The service was spotty--I didn't get my coffee until nearly the end of the meal and same deal with refilling my water glass
However, the space was cozy and looks like it would be very romantic for dinner
This place is perfect, great food, wonderful staff, amazing view and location, perfect after a walk over the brooklyn bridge

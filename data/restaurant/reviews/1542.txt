There was supposedly a miscommunication with a waitress change, but common sense states that you should make sure all your customers are set
Bottom line - our order was never given to the staff and the replacement waitress assumed that we had already eaten - even though NONE of our place settings were touched
Incompetent staff
Hooray for Essex! The brunch here is extremely reasonable
Drinks are plentiful and are served promptly
The food is tasty and will definitely fill you up
I've had dinner here many times as well and have nothing but kudos for the filet mignon
only $19 and SO tender
Give the goat cheese salad and mojitos a try as well
If you want a hip, laid back atmosphere go to Essex
Essex brunch is such a mellow blend of chill people, FLOWING bloody marys mimosas, eclectic DJ, and the perfect amount of light for a Sunday AM
The food is great, try the turkey sausage
I started inviting people friends there and they have told others
Its really a safe bet
AND ALL FOR $15!! Dont miss out
And as a re-butt, the hostess was doing a FINE job
I waited a small amount of time and was always checked on by the hostes
I didn't really understand the system that Essex uses for seating their customers
My three friends and I made a reservation for brunch, and arrived on time, but were not seated for 45 minutes! And the staff wasn't exactly apologetic
I guess lower eastsiders aren't used to above average service, and are willing to lower their standards
Anywhere else in the city there are millions of great brunch restaurants competing with each other, and keeping their standards high
Lack of real competition has probably made Essex lazy
At the end of the day, eggs are eggs, and the brunch at Essex was not worth the wait at all
We have been to Essex several times with large dinner parties and they have with uniformly postive experiences
The menu is varied and creative and good for sharing
Try the potato pacakes three-ways, the tuna spring roll and the mussels with chorizo
The service is fast and efficient, though definitely some of the waiters are more on the ball than others, and best of all, we were given a private balcony for our group which was perfect for after dinner cake cocktails
The wait staff is well meaning but untrained
They served a bread basket but no bread plates
Had to request salt and pepper
After taking our orders, another person came to the table to announce the special dishes which the waiter forgot prompting 2 in our party to cancel the original orders in favor of the specials
Appetizers mains were good with nothing over $20
The potato pancake dish was excellent
The 3 tartare dish begged for a sauce, yet the calamari had 3
Insist on the wasabi sauce with it
Fairly priced wine list
Desserts, except for the mouse cake and creme brulee, were a major disaster
They forgot one main ingredient in mine and brought it back; it was again forgotten
Very noisy, but polite crowd
My boyfriend and I discovered the Liquid Brunch a few weeks ago and we've been drinking our brunch at Essex almost every weekend since
The bloody mary's are spicy and strong and the Lobster Benedicts and chicken apple sausage are out of this world
Be warned that this place can get pretty crowded, though the $3 bloody mary's at the bar and the killer DJ make the wait more than bearable
I visited this spot last year when I made my 1st adult trip to NY for my birthday
I found it on a city guide trying to have an economically enjoyable time
I later found out another group of friends were going to be in the city at the same time so I made reservations for brunch for us all
We had the BEST time, the mimosa's kept coming, the food was pretty decent especially the apple sausage which we BEGGED to buy extra to bring back to Ohio to no avail
The waitress was very accomodating to our noisy group of women, even offered to take our pictures for us
(not all servers were friendly) When my girlfriend called me to get the name because they are planning another NY trip, I had to look it up and leave my recommendation,,, Excellent value for the $$$$$
Took my parents to Essex for Easter Brunch
The Baked Eggs with Chicken Apple Sausage was out of this world
The bloody marys were strong and the pitcher of momosas was bottomless
And the best part was the price--$14 a person with drinks
Essex is a nice place for a drink, but beware
The prices seem to change depending on who you speak to and how intoxicated you appear
Also, carry your drink with you EVERYWHERE
I left a half full $10 (but only $9 earlier in the evening) drink at a table with a large group of friends while I used the restroom
When I returned it was gone
To make matters worse, this happened again later in the evening
I discussed these two issues with our waitress but she did not seem to care
Needless to say, I will not be returning to Essex
We stumbled onto this diamond in the rough after our dinner plans at Schiller's were thwarted by a 90 minute wait
Though you would barely notice Essex from the outside, the school-door entrance led us into an enormous skylit dining room with  balconies on both ends
After about a 20 minute wait at the bar where I had an excellent pomegranate martini, we were given a balcony table which, given the noise level in the bar, was surprisingly quiet
Our server helped us choose a really nice Washington State red for $30
The food, a blend of Latino and Jewish comfort food, was uniformly good, particularly the lobster empanadas and the potato crusted swordfish
Desset, which was a black and white cookie cake, was tasty and unique
Only qualm--no espresso and the coffee they did have was tepid at best
Overall, definitely worth the trip
Tried the booze-inclusive $14 brunch
Bloody marys and mimosas were strong and tasty
Food took almost an hour to arrive at our table
i had potato pancakes and black bean hash
the hash was unpalatable
pasty, undercooked beans, oversalted and underspiced, mixed with droopy strands of spinach
Yuck
The potato cakes were alright, but the kitchen skimped on the sauce, so they were pretty dry
My companion's benedict was fine
The second we wiped our lips at the end of the meal, the waitress came by to say that she didn't want to rush us, but she needed to seat someone at our tble
Oh, no rush, just seat them here! If you want a great boozy brunch (for 3 dollars less!) try Basso Est
better food unlimited cocktails!
My boyfriend and I LOVE having brunch in the city
We are always looking for new places that match our personality and style and this secret hideaway was it! Laid back, cool and stylish - Not only does Essex have absolutely mouth watering incredible food, but they basically have unlimited drink specials -- my favorite, the infamous bloody mary -- all for the low fixed price of $12!! The service is awesome, if you have reservations -- if not, you can wait at the bar and enjoy their delicious drinks for the bargain price of $3 a pop! Last time we went, our waitress literally had our next round of drinks waiting for us each time we were ready! Friendly and easygoing, this place is the best place for brunch I have been to in the city!
Went for brunch for the first time this Sunday and we were all quite impressed
The liquid brunch consisting of 3 drinks (bloody marys, mimosas or screwdrivers) and coffee and an entree is quite a bargain
The drinks were quite decent and essentially endless (we got more than 3 each)
The entrees that we sampled (sunday fish platter, omelete, eggs benedict) were all quite good
After sitting eating and drinking for 2 hours were very satisfied
Definitely a bargain for fixed $12 (a few entrees are a bit more)
The service was decent and friendly
Make reservations unless you want to wait a while
I hate to even write about this place, because I don't want my secrete to get out, but this is by far the best brunch place in the city
Combine the trendy electic lower east side crowd with an excellent DJ and unlimited bloody marys and mimosas, and you have heaven
Oh by the way the food is excellent too
Great menu with a varied selection which includes lobster benedict and lox and bagels
A friend and I just happened upon Essex last Friday night
We felt we found a little treasure in the middle of the LES! Gorgeous space, sophisticated ambiance, FANTANTIC martinis and very chill overall
Sarah, the brunette bartender, was wonderful, mixing one great drink after another, and attending to our needs more attentively than any bartender I've come across in a long, long time
Definitely coming back
Given the low prices on the menu outside I was even more shocked to find sophisticated and tasty food, professionally served in sleek, open space

food is ok, prices fair, svc
could be better
but this is a very popular spot
my family goes on occasions, but I would not go if not for the get togethers
can get better elsewhere
The SUM IT: Dim sum standard fair, noodles ok, other dishes ok
Good Chinese food, great snails, outstanding Peking Pork Chops
Never had a bad meal
Good ambiance, valet parking
However, my sons (young adults) did not like the food
In Short A Pastis-like crowd swells the 7,000-square-foot space that's been cast with tile flooring, dark wood trim and weathered mirrors
To avoid the crowds, go during lunch, when the menu is augmented with warm sandwiches, entree-sized salads and country omelettes
The dinner menu features straightforward French fare--potato-crusted salmon, bouillabaisse and roasted chicken with haricot verts
Desserts include creme brulee and an apple tart
The atmosphere is fun and chic, the food is excellent and the host is sooo sweet (Jack!)
I love it at lunch time, less expensive, excellent food, awesome people-watching (Hi, Regis who is right next to our table) and really nice and airy in the summertime when they open the windows
Awesome place for a work-lunch, lunch-date, evening glass of wine or dinner with a friend
We go here all the time for sushi at the bar
It has some of the best sushi in NYC
The decor is like a brasserie and has a fairly laid-back atmosphere
I came to Rue 57 on a date a few months back and the waiter was rude, pushy and had no social skills whatsoever
I thought the price was high for what we had, but expected for a French restaurant in NYC
The atmosphere was crowded and relatively loud due to the proximity to the other tables
The wine arrived at the same time as the food with no time to let the wine sit
The waiter poured the wine so quickly that it splashed and was dripping down the outside of both glasses
After pouring our wine, he slammed the bottle down and walked away
Next our meal arrived and again slamming our plates down on the table and walked away without asking if we needed anything
I was so unhappy with the rude and sloppy behavior that I did not leave a tip
We left our cash and walked out
It was a very poor experience and I would not return again
But, what can we expect from the French?
Service was horrible, food was horrible, got water splashed all over me and all I got was a lousy eye look from the waiter
No need to say anymore about this place
Take my advice, and stay the HELL AWAY!!!!!
Try the mediterranean salad, it is a true experience for your taste buds!! The burger was great, also
In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great
The tables are close together and lunch will cost you 40 bucks, but you have to remember that you are on 57th street in NYC!!! What do you expect?!?! This place is a great stop for great food
I was there for lunch and a brunch and I can tell you that you will not be dissapointed
incredible from service to palette
I will be a regular  The bar staff is the best and the manager makes you feel like you've just returned from a long time away
welcoming you home!  A must in NYC
This restaurant is not worth the time, effort, or money to say the least
From the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal
The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent
The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful
Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected
Service was prompt and courteous
This was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again
Crowded and cramped, but we got over it
Waiter didn't even come over to see how our meal was
We had a problem with the way our eggs were cooked
So the manager comes over??? He was so rude and blamed us for the way we ordered
I didnt't think it would be such a big deal, especially since I was paying $8 for two eggs
Just wanted them cooked a little more
He was so loud that people were staring! I still can't believe what happened
I eat out at least 5 times a week and i've never had such a bad experience
On a cold and rainy Monday around lunchtime Rue 57 looked great from the street
Wet, hungry and longing for a glass of wine we were greatly surprised when we were seated right away
My friend and I each had an appetizer and split the Kobe mini burgers
My tempura shrimp roll was great
The shrimp was still warm
Yummy! When the entree arrived they had taken the time to split the entree, even down to cutting the third mini-burger in half! It was a perfect end to our girls weekend in NYC!
I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth
In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd
The food was well prepared and the service impecable
I'm going back
I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer
It's really also the service, is good and the waiters are friendly
For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves
Ambiance was great
Enjoyed standard of Wine Choices Beer (nice and cold)  Main courses: Beef Tenderloin and Beef Bourgignon were Horrible
The Tenderloin was overcooked and the Saturday beef special was disgusting
No taste an meet full of fat!
Had a dinner date (her suggestion) :) Had the mussels (really good) and smoked salmon (not the best) for appys
The chilean sea bass was great and the wed nite special of lamb shank was not too shabby
Service was pretty good
We ate downstairs so it was more secluded and less noisy than upstairs
however, the menu selections was all over the place
not a good idea since they cannot specialize on a few good dishes
I can only assume that the poor folks that raved about this place are not NYers
The service is bad, the food is overpriced for what it is ( it ain't good) no substitutions are allowed
So how is an Atkins gal supposed to have a cheeseburger a nice salad, when the waiter is pushing French fries bread? I'll tell you how - she has to pay xtra for that salad pay the same price for that burger, sans fries bread
She also has to beg for water refills squeeze her smallish rear-end between crowded tables
And they are crowded
Next time, I'll to go Astro Diner 1 block down the street, where I'm sure I'll get what I want, for 1/2 the price
What was I thinking?
I first came to Rue 57 for a bite to eat -not expecting to have a great meal
little did I know
I had an amazing fish entree that melted in my mouth, with a good martini on the side! the atmosphere was great - not too loud, but not quiet/romatic either
me and my girl friend had a great time
the Service was great
nice waiter and manager
who thanks to them -we got dessert -and it was the best thing I ever had! dont remember the name of the menu -but it was chocolate cake-like with melted chocolate inside
that oozed out when you dig into it! SO GOOD!! don't miss it
also great to share on a date!

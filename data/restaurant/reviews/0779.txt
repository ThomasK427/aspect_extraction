Atmosphere is very fun
Service can be slow
If you don't mind spending $ check it ou!
heard about this new restaurant and gave it a try
After the maitre'd left us in the entry hall for 5 minutes we found our way to the bar to wait for our fourth
When we were ready to be seated, we had to ask 4 different waitstaff, each of whom looked confused/shocked by our request
We were finally seated at a lounge table and when we asked to sit at a 'real dinner table' were told we needed to specify that when making a dinner reservation
The place was not full, however they refused to move us
The food was fine, but nothing extravagant, the saving grace was the wine (which was overpriced) and the menu limited
I wll inever go back to eat here, which is too bad because the decor was nice
Came here for a friend's birthday this weekend and had a good time
The food is a supposed to be a fusion of Indian and American, but it was mostly American fare with a bit of spice
The dishes were also on the smaller side, and there weren't many menu choices
The best part were the beautiful round lounges that surprisingly fit many people and allowed for intimate conversations
This spot is amazing
The food was incredible - the lobster dish, the chicken dish, and the lamb dish were so delicious and creative - I have been to the city's best restaurants and am not usually so impressed
The fact that Taj has apparently only been open for three weeks and has been booked solid speaks for itself
This is a must try!!!!
I went to Taj for dinner on Saturday nite and stayed there afterwards to sample the nightlife
The food was a better than expected fusion of Indian and American cuisines
My main complaint is that the entree portions were somewhat small
However, the prices were very reasonable
Also, half of the dinner tables are at a regular eating height, while the rest are at coffee table height, which made it difficult to eat
The service was great and the waitstaff was pretty attractive
After dinner, the place got crowded pretty quickly
There were a lot of extremely beautiful models present, but mostly accompanied by male models
The bottle prices were slightly absurd, with a going rate of $350 just for ketel one
The music on saturday nite was some very average house music
All in all, the place is pretty hot and should have some staying power
Great fusion Indian food
The chicken dish was beyond words! The place is in a great space and provides for a great, relaxed atmosphere
Great Food, Great Service, Cool Place
It has only been open about 2 weeks
Food was infused with amazing flavors
Services was top quality, very pleasant and professional without being fussy
Scene was very cool with appropriate music that did not dominate
Top marks all around
I went to taj last fri
for the first time
the music was great and the vibe was really cool
The simply grilled salmon really does rank up there among the top that NYC restaurants have to offer
Not your typical dry grilled salmon, but juicy and uniquely flavorful
Contrary to these negative reviews, the staff was nice and capable
I've gone to Croton twice to get the tuna - it is absolutely delicious! Both times I've taken new people with me to try it and everyone has been completely blown away by the dish
The steak is also good, but not memorable
The only disappointment is the wait staff
Both times I had very cold and unattentative waiters (and I believe one time was a manager)
We went for an early supper before a show at MSG; we were greeted warmly, seated promptly at a table by the window
Our waitress brought over the pre-theatre menu when she found out we were going to a show, reccommending it (rightly so) as a good value
The grilled salmon was perfectly cooked, my mom's steak was scrumptious
The portions were ample, the wine list basic but ample, and the decor
The bar crowd looked happy, and well out of their teens
I first came to this place because I heard of their happy hour specials
It was great
Downstairs was nice and ambiant, good music and great drinks at unheard of prices
I had dinner there a week later and found that not only was the service great, the food was better than most upscale restaurants that I've been to
I definitely will be telling everyone about my find
This was a great find
I've worked in the midtown area for years and it needed a place like this
It was recommended by a friend and turned out to have it all
The food was great, the atmosphere is comfortable and the service was even better
It was a busy Friday night during the Holiday Season and the servers had time to say hello and give a complete description of the menu with a smile
Lively and friendly is how I describe it
I've been back several times and have not been disappointed
Worth the trip
Made reservations here out of convenience of the location
We were seated promptly and treated with friendly attentive service
The food was excellent and everyone enjoyed their meals
The waiter was patient and helpful and very genuine even tho' he wasn't a polished burnt out snob as you find in so many places today
The prices are up there without being over the top but the quality of the food commands it
The atmosphere was that of a better bar/lounge/restaurant, the word Tavern seems to not be fitting
Looking for a restaurant in midtown that won't break the bank? Try CRT
Excellent food, good selection of beer on tap, and an excellent martini (stirred not shaken - Sorry James Bond!)
Thought it would be more crowded on a Saturday night, my only criticism
Hopefully CRT will stick around and continue to grow some loyal followers
So used to midtown places either being over-priced or just plain nasty
Croton is a welcome breath of fresh air - great atmosphere, lively, friendly and surprise surprise, the food is real restaurant quality and at reasonable prices
We loved it
A great find in midtown
Exposed brick, wrought iron, beautiful bar and friendly staff made our dinner here very enjoyable
Our server was very familiar with the menu and recommended some great appetizers
Service was prompt, attentive and food was great
We had the Tuna and Rib Eye steak (huge) - as good as any Steak House in the city and less $$
Good wine selection and specialty drinks
Maybe a little too good if you know what I mean
Highly recommended
Great fun for after work unwinding - Barfood menu was extensive the hysterical bartenders joked with me and my freinds all night
The place was packed despite the snow and everyone was having a great time - includng the chef who could barely stand
the best place in the neighborhood bar none!
The crabcakes needed some crab
However, the rest of the food was perfect
The chicken was tender and flavorful
The simply grilled salmon was not all that simple and I'm glad for that as it was the best salmon I've ever had
The shrimp cocktail, although pricy at first glance, I realized was worth every penny once it landed on the table (big shrimp)
the good, the bad, the ugly - Bottom line is the food is good, the drinks were a bit weak and the waitstaff needs training
We're supposed to be waited on - not us waiting for them
Staff dissappeared after 2PM and we had to send a search party to find our waitress who was parked at a table upstairs reading a newspaper
Didn't expect that in midtown!
Just had a fine meal there after finding the place here on Citysearch
Met a date there and was impressed with the selection of scotches, while my date enjoyed the house CRTini

I waited almost 30 minutes for my appetizer and the waiter forgot to give us bread in the meantime
It took so long to get my food that by the time my my rosemary-less rosemary potatoes and my well-done and fatty steak came - that I ordered RARE - I was too hungry to bother to send it back
The only plus is the patio
Absolutely great experience
We were a group of 4 -- ordered 3 of their daily special apps, we each ordered an entree and got 3 desserts
Everything was really tasty
My only criticism was for the apricot dessert (it takes 15 min to make), which was a little tart for my taste
I love this place
The food seems very real, just like the food I remember from Vienna
The feel of the place is very authentic from traditional decor to central European servers and europop unobtrusively playing through a very good sound system (even on the loo!) Everything we tasted, the schnitzels, the goulash, the strudel was just right
The brunch here is excellent
Try the French Toast--it comes with apricot preserves, spicy apples, sour cream AND syrup
It's heavenly
The eggs florentine are excellent, as well
the server threw an over-dressed salad on my lap, and was hardly apologetic
Asked what dishes he would recommend, he flatly responded that there were all good
The oysters had been washed and washed with water, there was no brine, no taste of the ocean that one orders oysters for
I'd been wanting to go here for a while--I was disappointed
I have never had food this delectable before! From the goulash to the schnitzel, the food is mouth watering
You have to try the mushrooms! My husband doesn't normally eat them, but now he's hooked on this dish!! And their desserts are to die for
Brought my family of four and I'll be going back for more!!
My wife and I have had dinner at Thomas Beisl twice in the past few weeks (once at the bar, once seated in the dining room)
This restaurant, in my mind, is the best addition to the Fort Greene restaurant scene since our moving to the neighborhood about a year ago (though we are still partial to A Table)
The food is delicious and the menu and beer selection sway far from the usual offering (tripe, anyone?)
Outside of BAM parking their buses directly in front of the restaurant, the restaurant is warm and charming and well-worth a visit
1
It is not a big place, and typical of NYC restaurants, even Brooklyn, we (party of 2) were nearly sitting in the laps of the people in the tables one either side
2
The tables themselves were quite small, the dinner plates big
3
They were out of goulash the weekend evening we went, so I settled on the hamburger which I asked for medium-rare but it came closer to medium-well
4
For the above reasons, we did not feel comfortable enough there to stick around and order dessert

Good points? The service was friendly, we had made a reservation and were seated promptly, other than the cramped seating and small tables the ambiance was nice, and our mediocre restaurant experience was offest by the highlight of the evening-- the movie Nowhere in Africa at BAM
I had the beef cheeks goulash with spaetzle, which I have to admit was the best goulash I've ever had
The goulash has a fabulous undertone of sweet Hungarian paprika without the hashed taste of it
The sauce/gravy was thick and beefy without being gooey or creamy
The spaetzle was pan-fried with butter so it's mildly crusty on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside
And the beef cheeks
wow, I've never had meat so tender and delicious in my life
My friend ordered the pork loin with sauerkraut which I tried, and it was decent, not fabulous
My other friend had the butterfied trout grilled in butter and capers, served with broccolini and some old-world grain, which he said was okay too
The best dish was definitely the goulash
I will definitely come back for more goulash when the temperature drops below freezing point again
I live in Park Slope and invited a few friends from Long Island to come out to dinner
We made reservations in advance and were seated immediately on a Saturday night
From the moment we sat down 'til the moment we got up, we were just amazed at the exceptional level of food and service we received
Everything from the appetizer to the main course, dessert and wine were extraordinary
The decor is rustic and very warm and pleasant
The maitred' and the chef/owner were both extremely gracious and the service was outstanding
I am so used to getting great food with attitude or bad food with great service that this was a refreshing change
Needless to say, my friends love Brooklyn thanks to Thomas Beisl
Eating well in Bklyn has gotten considerably easier in the last years
Few establishments, however, have succeeded in the area of consistency and character
Too many have acquired a tired '90s' self-importance which is truly at odds with this more personable boro
Thomas Beisl may be the first to enter the ranks of the truly exceptional
Despite having opened only a few weeks ago, the owner/chef and the supporting staff are in command of a clear vision--a warm and accessible room with food that is both exquisite and familiar leaving one with the impression that Thomas Beisl is practising more than just a fine craft, but sharing the result of well considered years of experience
The most memorable restaurants, in my opinion, are those that engage you in a quiet way and bring you back again and again
I hope to return here many times
This restaurant is a block away from my wife and my appartment, and we eat here probably twice a month
We adore the staff and devour the food
Fabulous
I had just moved to New York a few months before Pisticci opened, and I lived just around the corner, so this place is very near and dear to my heart
I remember being served free pasta and wine the night of the grand opening, and I've been back many times since then
I'm happy to see that they've added a little more space, and that they're thriving after three great years
Both the food and ambiance really do remind me of the little trattorias that I frequented while traveling in the remote parts of the Italian countryside
This is not haute cuisine, but that' part of what I love about it - it has an honest, intimate feel with no pretensions, just like eating in an Italian family's home
This place has simple, tasty Italian fare for a great price, and the place is small enough (even with its new extension) to feel like home
Drinks are served in jelly jars and a bowl of spaghetti is just $6
50! The signature iced tea, garlic bread, and tiramisu are amongst the best in the city
This place is great, i probably shouldn't be saying anything in fact but they have always been great to me and they will be great to you as well
It's a warm restaurant with delicious meals at fair prices
Don't miss out on the Matagliati or the Meatballs with Polenta, a true delight!
after traveling around italy and yearning for more, i am happy to find the one spot in town where i feel transported back
pisticci has terrific food, creative choices and a genuinely warm atmostphere that cannot be manufactured
a perfect choice for dining alone, with parents, with friends or on a romantic night out
Pisticci is not only a neighborhood favorite, but a place the whole upper west side should get familiar with
The food is wonderful, the specials are creative and make use of the best season items around
The fig salad is amazing, as is the homemade fettuccini with mushrooms and truffle oil
Their iced tea is beyond refreshing and the desserts are great
The staff is knowledgeable and helpful
Pisticci has a great little spot on the Upper West Side and for the most part is a quality restaurant where you can expect pretty standard pasta dishes and above average taste
I recommend the polenta over meatballs
The wait staff is a bit suspect, they kept coming back to the table asking what we ordered
Comfortable place to dine
Wonderful food
Friendly staff
Outside seating
Small, but good use of space
West Harlem doesn't have many places for a 'going-out' meal, so Pisticci would be welcome enough even if they didn't serve delicious homemade pasta, inventive specialty dishes, delicious desserts, and tasty brunch food in a rustic-chic, cozy basement room that makes you forget the subway is thundering by a block away
add the restaurant's motto paga poco mangia bene (pay little, eat well) and you have an instant love affair
A dependable local institution, in an area that doesn't have much in the way of choice in Italian restaurants
Very friendly and welcoming
The food is pretty good, but the main point is that it's a pleasant, useful place to have around the corner
They even brought a free dessert for a birthday without us ordering it
In Short This airy room, located on a prime corner in Williamsburg, is decorated with caramel tones, French street signs and quaint prints
The neighborhood crowd eases into the casual scene, sipping wine and snacking on cheese
The menu features mussels in varied preparations, including red-curry broth, light Provencal salads and bouillabaisse, served with the dense stock as a first course and the seafood second
Desserts are of the creme brulee variety

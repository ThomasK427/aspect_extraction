Me and my boyfriend came to the restaurant for our anniversary last week
Everything was just right, mood was just right
It was romantic, with dim candle light, some soft music and some fine wine, not to mention the mouth watering appetizers
And the dessert yummy,,He did something right by taking me there for out anniversary
I fell in love with him all over again :)
I first had dinner at Dish a few weeks ago and now it is my new favorite restaurant
The food is excellent, extremely fresh and beautifully presented
Besides the food, the restaurant itself is gorgeous, nothing like you would normally find in Brooklyn
If you are looking for a great place to eat with a terrific scene than this is the place to go
I would highly recommend it to everyone
The sushi was very fresh
The decor is very trendy
My dinner really hit the spot, it was delicious
I told all my friends about dish and i am definately looking forward to having dinner there again
Dish is a great restaurant and has a really nice bar as well
I am a sushi lover and Dish has some of the best that I have ever tasted
The food is delicious, fresh and reasonably priced
Even if your not a sushi fan, they serve a little bit of everything
I would even recommend going, if you just want to go and have a couple of drinks at the bar
They have a beautiful bar with an extensive drink menu
I highly recommend Dish to all who want great food, service and a beautiful atmosphere
Dish is the most trendy new place in Bay Ridge
The restaurant is beautifully decorated, like nothing you would normally find outside of Manhattan
The food is out of this world, with a great menu selection
They have lounge like music playing as you dine and it has a fantastic ambience
I highly recommend trying Dish if you want a magnificent dining experience
I came to have dinner with two of my girlfriends on saturday and had an awsome time
The food was greate and the environment was very pleasant
Staff was friendly and the music was good too
Definately an awsome place to go for some good food
This area is packed with restaurants
I don't think there is anything as trendy as Dish
The sushi is delicious and the entrees are really good too
The weekends get packed fast so I would go during the week if you get a chance
The Scene A welcoming, open facade leads to a bi-level interior decorated gallery-style with the works of noted local artists such as James de la Vega
Wine is prominent, either in pours from the subterranean wine cave or as decoration along the street-level dining room walls filled with Hell's Kitchen locals
The Food Though much of the menu draws from border countries with the likes of pasta, cordon bleu and schnitzel, dishes that involve cheese are best
A crusty hunk of toasted French bread smothered in melted Swiss and garnished with caramelized onions is a great shareable starter and kirsch-kicked fondue has the perfect consistency
The raclette, gruyere-like cheese heated over an open flame and scraped off the wheel as it melts, oozes with a touch of smokiness and is a hard-to-find highlight
Stray only for the rich Jacques Torres chocolate fondue, with its array of fresh fruit and marshmallows
It alone is worth the visit
My partner and I went to Swizz for our 5th Anniversary
We used to live in Switzerland and were craving a good fondue
Swizz definately provided the flavor
While there is only 1 fondue on the menu (it's moie-moie), it's quite good
Unfortunately, there wasn't even enough cheese in ours for us to get through all the bread they gave us
They also didn't scrape the cheese at the bottom (which is the best part and is always done in Swizterland
) But for an American experience, it was more than pleasant
The wine menu is also good, with a large selection for $25
We finished it all off with the Jacque Torres chocolate fondue which was equisite (though I'm still trying to figure out why a restaurant called Swizz would use american chocolate)
All in all, I would definately recommend it, it was good food for a good price
You'd hope on Valentine's Day they'd have a few extra servers on hand - didn't get water for 20 minutes, first course for an hour after seated
Food was excellent though and (almost) worth the wait
Just wish the service had been up to par, as it really put a damper on the romance factor
Check it out, but not when you know it'll be busy!
I just hosted a bridal shower for 14 ppl at Swizz--and it was perfect! We reserved the wine cave (a private party room) and it was the perfect setting for a small shower
Everyone loved the food (you must have the chocolate fondue) and the service was great
I would definitely go back there again
I had held a surprise birthday party here and the staff was more than willing to help make it the most perfect evening as possible
They had help me plan everything from the room to even rehearsing my skit
Aside from that, they were excellent hosts accomodating to my every need
The food was fantastic, I highly recommend the Nova Scotia Salmon with rsti potatoes (looks like hashbrowns!) and the fusilli with rose and garlic sauce
The wine selection is equally impressive as well, and quite reasonable in price
Out of the many appetizers, wine bottles and food we had ordered
The total only came out to $300 for over 15 people
I can't recommend them highly enough for a job well done and a beautiful restaurant with great food
Theres something for everyone on the menu, everything from a simple pasta to crazy swiss meals that ive never heard of
You cant go wrong because everything is good
Any bottle of wine is $22, red or white
Tips: request to site in the wine sellar, it is more secluded and ambience is much more romantic
Feel free to ask the staff any questions, because they are very helpful, everyone was extremely nice
very good place to take a girlfriend
our meal ended up being around $80 including an app 2 meals a bottle of wine and desert that we shared
We dined here recently and had a fantastic evening! The staff were all friendly
and knowlegable
The menu is different with cheese raclette, various fondues and has enough choice to satisfy everyone
One very interesting concept a wall of wine mostly California
some Swiss wines
all $22 a bottle and many names that you know, in addition to a regular list by the glass and bottle
I had venison with dumplings that was the best I have ever had
the others had salmon that was well prepared
Desert and Swiss coffee
a thank you from the chef
I could go on but it was great
Lots of people making their way to the wine bar downstairs
And yes we even got a tour of their wine cave that they apparently use for groups and special events
We dine out regularly
quality, good portions, friendly staff
what else could you want?
Both the Cheese and the Chocolate Fondue are the best around! They have a great wine list to compliment thier Swiss-American menu
I had the special (Venison) and it was fantastic! I try not to eat it often because if not cooked correctly, it can be gamey but this was very tender and juicy! Staff was amazing, the chef even came to ask how our meal was! Very Classy!
I went to the Harlem Grill this evening for Happy Hour
I have heard great things about it, and wanted to finally check it out
I sat at the bar to receive faster service, and boy was i wrong! The place was not even crowded
It was around 7pm, and people did not start showing up until 8ish
The bartendar took a while to make my drink, which was really simple: Malibu with cranberry and oj- No oj! I placed an order for a turkey burger
30 minutes had passed, and I asked the bartendar about my food

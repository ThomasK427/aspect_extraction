Oh finally what's with those waiter outfits, comon
Reservations were made a month in advance but it was absolutely worth it! We were seated promptly
Our waiter made great recommendations and we ordered the perfect amount of food for two people
The food was delicious! The service was excellent with an attentive wait staff
Restaurant decor is trendy and unique
I am a certified chef and was humbled not only by the creativity of the menu, but it's execution as well
We tried 5 different items and everything was with out question
Perfect
Great Work! Thank You for a fantastic experience
Dined on 12-28-04
Every single one of our server's recommendations was terrible: homemade ginger ale, green papaya salad
This restaurant tries to be too creative, too different with their food, all at the expense of the customer's palate, if you ask me
Decent dishes: giner fried rice, chicken curry, pork entree
One thing that annoyed me though was our waiter recommended too much food
And there were a couple of dishes we barely touched, yet he never asked us once if everything was alright
I felt a little robbed because he should know better than to recommend too much food and we ended up paying a lot more than we should have
This has been our second time dining at this restaurant and both times, the food was terrible
The best part of the meal was probably the dessert (coffee tapioca)
It's one of the new hot spots
so, what can you expect? Some attitude at the door, inexplicably high prices, mediocre food, and subpar service
BUT, the space is beautiful and the scene is hot
What looks to be a hand-carved wood column bar downstairs is worth a closer look and the lighting all around is intriguing and artful
And for those guys with wandering eyes, the waitresses' clingy, backless dresses appear to be sans-brassiere
In terms of food, it's less than what you pay for
The portions are small and the creative combination of ingredients and flavors are overwhelming
either too bitter or too heavy or too sweet
My girlfriend and I went and found a bit of lobster shell in our mushroom dish
I pointed it out to the waiter, very politely
It was taken away, with no apologies and no consideration
Not the best situation for a nice date
Salt is not the way to bring out flavor, but that seems to be the culinary insight at Spice
Everything you've read/heard positively about the atmosphere, service and decor is true - wonderful environment - but the food lacks originalty, destinction and genuine flavor
There's even salt sprinkled on the dessert cookies! All the fish dishes taste disappointingly similar, the one enjoyable memory was the pork rolls
Well what can I say, if you want to go there for the scene this is the place
Beautiful people
Food is
well
famous chef
lots of people
fun place though
It has been over a week since I ate at Spice Market and still can not get over the fact that such a trendy place only serves Absolut vodka at the bar
You can consider me a creature of habit but I enjoy my cosmopolitans with either Stoli O or Grey Goose Orange- but since they had neither I tried a cosmo with Absolut Mandarin- which I do not recommend
The food was ok- the prices I found suprisingly reasonable
The service was a bit inadequate-and be warned they bring your food as it is ready- so be sure to order apps then after being served order entrees
I have been dying to go to this restaurant that everybody has been raving about
First we had reservations as we walked in there 4 people behind the desk and not 1 of them greeted us for about 10 minutes, then the bar was not to packed but the bartenders were more interested in socializing behind the bar instead of making our $12 drinks
Besides the food was disgusting and like another city search member said it was food you could get from a street vendor
The place was very trendy but there are 100 other Great restaurants in the meat packing district i would go to before this one
My friends I recently went to Spice Market and had a near flawless experience
Yes, we had to wait a little despite our reservation, but with such a great bar scene, it wasn't an issue
The interior is one of the best designed in the city and the vibe is great in there
All of the dishes we ordered were incredibly delicious and meticulously prepared
Service was good, but not stellar
I suggest that anyone looking for a fun night out with great people watching and some of the best Thai/Malay food in the city!
and it doesn't hurt sitting next to Usher
A little disappinted in the quality of service
I expected professionals, but was instead met with an amateur waitstaff that made several ominous errors during the course of the meal
For the price, however, the quality of food is difficult to beat and I would challenge anyone who says the decor is anything but superb
Looking forward to trying it again to see if the service has improved
Space is amazing
Feeling of grandeur and decadence but food was near horrible
Bar downstairs is really cool and drinks are too
Staff very professional
Service was a little harried, but charming on our Monday night visit
We actually didn't have reservations and were dressed our part (non-wealthy grad students), but the hostesses were great and found us seats at the communal table, where you can watch all the spicing and dicing that gives this restaurant its name
The really excellent dishes were the ones that weren't trying to be too hard to be authentic: the green papaya salad was fantastic, with the interesting addition of crystalized ginger
Chicken w/ kumquat = very good; Viet
curry = just ok
Interesting wine list had Thai and Indian wines that weren't too shoddy!
Reception was pretty rude
Waiter service was ok
Food was ok nothing to brag about
Place filled up with pretentious people waiting to be seen
The only thing that was good was the atmosphere/lounge
Do yourself a favor and try the casarecci at Vento's which is close by
Service at Vento was excellent , staff thanked us for coming
More than I can say for overhyped the Spice market
Don't go expecting fantastic service, but we lucked out with a nice server who looked like Michele Yeoh
The food was pretty authentic - there was a Tom Yum soup (they called it Tomato Egg Drop), great sticky coconut rice, and fresh cod in chili sauce
My fiance even topped his dinner off with Durian ice cream *gag*  Jean-Georges's other Pan-Asian places are better, like Vong
Food is served as the kitchen prepares which means they can serve one plate to six people which happened to us
The service is pretentious and choc'ful of attitude
The food is average pan asian at best
Tried it for lunch the other day


The place is beautiful, the service was good, and the food was excellent! Many of the reviews talk about rude, poor service but, we didn't find that to be the case
Our server was friendly, explained dishes and the process (they brings dishes when they're ready in no particular order) and the fact that many of the dishes are spicy but, if you can't figure that out beforehand, you don't want to go there! (Duh!! It is called Spice Market!!) Having done all that, we were prepared and got a terrific lunch! The chicken samosas, chicken satay, and pork vindaloo were great!! A grilled chicken dish left something to be desired
That great, spicy food coupled with a home-made ginger beer, spiced with dark rum, made it really difficult to go back to work!
My boyfriend and I went to Spice Market with another couple and had a truly enjoyable experience
We started at the bar with a round of fresh pineapple margaritas, which were delicious, and leisurely made our way over to our reserved table, without being rushed
We ordered an array of appetizers and entrees and ate family style
Of particular note were the shaved tuna appetizer, short ribs, curried duck, and the pork vindaloo
We also got a couple orders of the sticky, super creamy coconut rice, which was quite tasty accompanied with the meat dishes
We didn't care much for the lime noodle dish, and the chocolate desert with the condensed milk ice cream was just OK
The waiter was pleasant, although the service could have been brought up a notch (water glasses were empty at times)
All said and done, I look forward to dining there again soon
Sure they tell you they are full, and no, they're not - welcome to NYC
Sure the drinks are $11 - welcome to NYC
However, unlike a lot of places the service was great: we walked in after not being able to get a reservation and were seated within 10 mins

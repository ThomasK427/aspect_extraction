I AM A CITY GIRL MYSELF
AND NEVER BEEN TO OTHER BOROUGHS EXCEPT MANHATTAN
I SHOULD SAY IT WAS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE OF THIS CUTE TAPAS BAR
I NEVER TRIED SUCH DELICIOUS FOOD
THIS CUTE ETHNIC TAPAS BAR OWNED BY DIEGO GONZALEZ
TRULY MASTER IN HIS COOKING
SERVICE WAS VERY ATTENTIVE AS WELL
THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THEIR OUT DOOR SEATING
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO THERE
OFCOURSE BEFORE SPRING
I KNOW MY SELF
I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
VERY SIMPLE INGREDIENTS
SO MANY CHOICES
EXCELLENT SANGRIA
VERY INFORMATIVE,FRIENDLY SERVICE
this is exactly what a tapas restaurant should be
everyone that works there seems like they've been off the plane from spain for just enough time to cook serve your meal
they are all incredibly friendly, giving u advice on what not to miss on the menu, travel tips to Spain (go Madrid before Barcelona), and serve up the very cheap ($5-$6) tapas, quick, fast hot
they have many unique tapas
definetly try the pork served with onions bread and the spreadable chorizo
they also have 5-8pm 2-for-1 drink happy hour which means we were drinking their incredible sangria for $2
50 a glass
fun little adventure for manhattanites to bedford (1st stop on L train in brooklyn), frankly i'd never been there before
was very cool, very ethnic felt a bit like haight ashbury with all the artist types cafes everywhere
try it, you'll love it
I've took my friends to try couple od Sspanish Tapas places in the city
Zipi Zape was our last stop and the finest
It only takes 5 minutes trip from Manhattan
The foie gras special was excellent
the tradional patatas bravas , tortilla was delicious
We tried most of the dishes
Each of them was unique and nicely done
The staff is all from Spain, friendly and prompt
We trully enjoyed this tapas bar and recommend it to everyone
Top notch tapas bar
My boyfriend spent 4 years in Madrid
So he is extremely picky when it comes to a spanish restaurants
We really enjoyed this cute tapas place
food is terrific
Our friends suggested this tapas bar
They also mentioned their weekend is always busy
So we decided to go tuesday night
We tried their cold tapas tasting for 10
it was extremely colorful and tasty
Then we moved on to the hot dishes
Bacalau special was perfect
Bechamel croquetas was to die for
like Zagat guide said
It was crunchy outside and runny inside
Loin of pork dish was perfectly seasoned
Spanish cheese plate has perfect selection
It was a very pleasant and enjoyable night
We were there tonight
I couldn't help myself to write couple notes for this tapas bar
Simply the food is suberb,service is very informative and fast
we felt like we were in Spain
Really otantic tapas bar
Thanks to Diego Gonzalez
Finaly we found out where you are
We had such a bless last night
Food is great , service is attentive yet casual
there were so many things we wanted to try
But one visit was not enough
we have to go and try more
My true favorites are crouquetas, Galician style octopus, Loin of pork
and tortilla
We really enjoyed the Sangria as well
highly recommended
worth a trip to Williamsburg
Very cool vibe, very cool experience, but I'm not chomping at the bit to go back
Why? The service was beyond excellent, if not a tad frosty
She really knew the food and had been trained to talk about it
She recommended an excellent Spanish white by the glass
The room is very comfortable; small but with tables spaced in a civilized manner (see Dumont for how NOT to do it)
It's just that everything was so loaded with garlic
I give them an A for effort but I couldn't taste anything in any of the dishes we tried because they were all topped off with sliver upon sliver of garlic
The best part was the cheese plate- excellent Spanish cheeses
If you want to ward-off vampires, this is the place to try
It may seem out of the way for some
but well worth the trip
We sat at the bar and ordered a ton of tapas that were wonderful and not too expensive either
The crostini w/ tuna salad wrapped in roasted peppers was one of my favorites as well as the pollo and you HAVE to order the fried chiperones as well as Sangria! Great new addition to brooklyn
Always my fav place for a quick coffee/muffin ($2
50!!) they now have an off-menu b/fast OATMEAL TO DIE FOR! I work near-by, and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item
They treat me like family, morning and night
I've had my wife meet me after work for dinner a couple of times; she loves this place too
Great value for the quality ingredients
Check it out
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation
Salads were fantastic
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me
We will be back
Starwich is a gem! Yesterday, I got delivery to my office (the pistachio crusted goat cheese salad) and a diet root beer
The salad was exquisite and soooo innovative I thought I was having GOURMET 5 STAR DELIVERY! The ingredients were so interesting and fresh
the roast pecans, the juicy beets, the savory dressing (a juicy blend of raspberry and rich green olive oil)

Dom Di Marco is a master
He uses only the finest ingrediants and cooks every slice to perfection
You will have to wait, you can't rush excellence,but it is worth it
Out of this world pizza
This man makes pizza an art
He takes his time, and each pie is a delicious slice of heaven
Don't mind the decor, because you'll be too busy savoring your pizza
Amazing! Also try DeMarco's too, which is supposed to be his son's place
After reading all the reviews here and many glowing recommendations on food blogs, I thought I MUST try this pizza! So, on Saturday I made the long (and I do mean LONG) trek to Avenue J
It took about 30 mins from Union Sq
on the Q
When we got there, the wait was just as everyone here has described, Domenico's process was just as described, but the pizza? Not so much
It's good, but nothing special
The blend of cheeses was tasty, but overall the sauce plus the buffalo mozzerella makes for a combination that is too watery for such a thin crust (the sicilian style crust would probably fare better)
Worth the trip and the wait (and the higher than average price)? I don't think so
There's better pizza to be had
Fughedabout any other pizza, this is perfection
It's like you died and went to pizza heaven
Domenico is THE GOD of making pizza
His pizza dominates any other slice you will ever have
This pizza is in a different league
Once you taste it, you will never think of pizza the same
It is definitely worth the trip to BK
Be prepared to wait
Perfection takes time
Nobody asked Picasso to paint fast, so don't expect The Picasso of Pizza to do any different
Note: Make sure you get at least one Square and one Regular
Di Fara is truly a miserable tiny place, but the aroma of a superb pizza doesn't let you turn around
You stay for more than an hour when you see the 2005 award for best pizzeria
Dominic is a thin, sixtyish old man who goes back and forth for the dough (one at a time), and prepares each pizza with no rush
Dominic will give you the ambience of the old times when they were all immigrants and good food was equivalent of good friends and unforgettable times
Dominic will smile even if you get impatient and more important he will keep on working methodically and impassively
If you really want to know what life was when our ancestors got to America give it a try
You won't regret it
You can always call and order, but you will miss the preparation
It's up to you
When we arrived we got in a line of about 6 people and thought that we were in luck and wouldn't have the famous hour-plus wait
We were wrong! We did not even ORDER our pizza for an hour
It took Dominic about 10 minutes to prepare each pizza, and it was comical to watch his highly inefficient system
The pizza was good, but Patsy's and Grimaldi's is better
The smell was heavenly, and the appearance was great, but the cheese was a little too salty and heavy
Worth one trip, though
Simply put, you will not be able to find better pizza than this anywhere
This place should be a national landmark
The owner is certainly a national treasure
This is the best by-the-slice pizza anywhere
Period
The entertainment value is enormous
The owner moves at the speed of molasses, but he's a gem and his pizza making is a art form to observe, from the manual crank cheese graters, to the way he takes the hot pies out of the oven by with both hands, tosses them on the counter, and chucks a handful of freshly grated parmagian on top to melt in while he's cutting the slices
The customer base is also classic Brooklyn
Not yuppie brownstone Brooklyn, but REAL Brooklyn
It all adds to the charm and authenticity
I think there's a short documentary to be done here
You must go here before you die, and preferably much sooner so you can repeat
no pizza in all five boros can touch this pizza
Great Pizza
The Freshest ingredients is whats makes the pizza so great
He takes his sweet time making each pie but man is it worth the wait
The ambience, well youre not going there for the ambience youre going there for great pizza
Best pizza in Brooklyn
One thing to know, not only is the pizza AMANZINGLY SUPERB! but the atmosphere is like something out of a movie
Old man making pizza, regulars chatting by the counter, kids in the window asking for change
Yes, it's not the tidiest place in the world, but who cares? It's the best slice (or pie) of pizza in the universe
You owe it to yourself to try it
If you mind waiting for your pie to be made (the wait canbe over an hour, especially for a square pie), I recommend calling ahead and placing your order for pick-up
a great stop over if youre in brooklyn
the place is minimal
but the pizza and the people make up for it
the pizza is always just coming out of the oven, since there's such a huge turnover with so many people ordering
one way to guarantee you get your slice faster then some, ask for a topping, dominic puts it on a slice while the pie's still baking, so when it comes out you don't have to wonder if you'll be the lucky few who'll get a slice or have to wait for a new pie
the best topping is extra cheese, fresh mozzarella pieces put right on the slice
This pizza is worth the trek to Ave
J in Brooklyn
Pick a day when you have time
You can wait a while for a slice but boy is it worth it
Watching Dominic hand slice the fresh mozzerella, cleaning off a table so you can sit, and then waiting for that next pie to come out are all part of the package
Your best bet is to go with someone and order a whole pie
He doesn't have pies just sitting around getting cold
He eyeballs the crowd asks what they want and then makes it
Everything is snatched up within a couple of minutes
The square is the best
I love the pizza here
I discovered this place about 6 years ago
This is the real deal pizza place, great if you're in the hood and want something great to eat
I would also recomend entire pies for pick-up if you live near by
The square slice is an exercise in perfection
Being able to watch Domenick make the pie from spreading the dough to grating the parmesean is a treat to treasure
Eating the slice is really fuun, because you get about 10 harmonious textures in your mouth all at the same time, and it tastes great, I like to say that the sauce tastes a little sweet and a little sour
But not like Chinese food
It is so good
Domenick and his kids are great
And it is so fun to be there!
cause it really seemed like a labor of love that guy making the pizza, but the end product for me didn't meet my expectations
At over $2 a slice it's more expensive than the average slice
The wait was very long
The crust was good, the flavor was good (I think they grate some sort of hard cheese over the pie), but the pizza was a bit watery, with the cheese sliding off rather than clinging to the slice
It's been 25 years since I moved from the neighborhood, where I had my first slice at DiFara when I was 5
I recently was back and had to stop in for a slice
It was as good as ever! Sometimes you make things from your childhood better in your memory, but DiFara's Pizza was as good as I remember it
Best thin crust in pizza New York, be prepared to wait it's worth it

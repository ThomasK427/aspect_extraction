None of us liked our food and furthermore, lower the volume
7A's food doen't need to be as good as it is
You walk in expecting nothing but when the food arrives it's always great
I've been coming here for years because it's always so pleasant
No fuss
No attitude
My friends and I have been going to 7A as long as I can remember
Usually for late night bites after a night of drinking
We all sat down and ordered full entrees, and then asked to order a bottle of wine and were DENIED
based on our level of intoxication
It was 11pm on a school night, and we certainly were not too drunk to drink
What has happened to the East Village????
Yeah, it's spiced up diner food
But it's GOOD! Tuna Melt, Chicken Cordon Bleu and Salmon burger are favorites, for sure
Great late night spot but it is usually very crowded
You may be rushed- you usually dont have to ask for the check to get it! Forget Brunch- there are usually people waiting outside, although the brunches are delish as well!
This is my favorite weekend spot for breakfast/brunch
I have never had a bad meal and I have always had good service
It can get a bit tight in the indoor seating area, but what better way to get to know your neighbor (and maybe pick off his/her plate)?
fresh, yummy food and fun, lively atmosphere
this is our favorite neighborhood place to go for brunch on the weekends
all the food is delicious--except the one funny thing is that they refuse to make egg white omelletes--just won't do it; last time I asked, the waiter laughed and said the cooks won't even do it for him
go figure--obviously, i love the place, so i keep coming back anyways
oooh, i've hd late night dinners here to
good stuff
i think it's open 24/7
The food is just okay
The prices are good
The service is terrible
The waits are long on the weekend
Good for a cheap brunch, or really a cheap anytime meal
I like it
And they even have pitchers of beer
The service isn't the best in the world, but what do want for that kind of money?
Despite the long lines this bar/eatery has a great brunch for the morning after-hangovers! Get drunk at night and then come back in the morning to cure the nausea with brunch and a screwdriver! Great for dates but bad for crowds because of the limiting space
And be prepared to wait because almost all of the east villagers are already aware of this little hideaway across from the park
This is one of those places that when all else fails, there's 7A! They offer a better menu than a diner, the prices are good and it is down to earth
good for after-partying or just dinner
The waiters are always super nice and relaxed
stumbling through the East Village at midnite on a freezing Friday nite in January
vowing to eat at the next restaurant that we stumbled upon, and it's a good thing we did
the inside of the restaurant resembles a diner, so we thought we'd be getting diner-quality good
we couldn't have been more wrong
both of us ordered filet mignon mashed potatoes
the filet came out and was absolutely delicious, on a bed of julienned vegetables in a balsamic vinagarette sauce
MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!
7A is open 24/7 and is great for lunch, brunch or a late night visit after partying all night
This is the local spot where we can always count on for a great brunch, a California Burger, the best fries or their carrot dressing for salads
Nevermind Sidewalk (across the street with horrendous service), there is a reason why there's a wait, it's great food, served quick
for cheap
PS- If you get there by 11, there's hardly a wait for brunch
My friend told me of a great place to get buffalo wings and he was right
The places are always piled high, and they're pretty great here
i might say one of the best ones i've ever had
seating is rather cramped, and some waiters can be a bit on the rude side and not show up very often, but good food none the less and definitely a good bang for the buck
groups are good if you can stand the wait for tables to free up
I've always had a good time with my friends here
Great food! fantastic brunch, there are many options, the service is great, good value
ALthough my party of 4 had to wait 20 minutes for a seat
It was well worth it
A must for Sunday brunch
I start daydreaming about Saturday brunch at 7A on Tuesday
A big pile of seasonal fruit and strawberry butter on french toast, good coffee, a hopping crowd, friendly service
it's all worth the wait
And great prices too
A great place to eat! Tasty food at a great price! Cute waiters to boot - what more can you ask for? Oh yah
they have an outdoor patio which is  so nice on sunny days - watch all the East Villagers go by
You'll love it!
Went to 7A for a quick bite on a Fri
night, food was great, service was great and it's really cheap! Also in a nice location
I posted a not so nice, but fair, review here a while back, which was taken down promptly
But I maintain my position
The unattractive lighting made me want to gag, the food was overpriced, there was the most awful disco pop duo performing-and my escargot looked like it might crawl off the plate
I have never in my life sent back food before, but I simply had to, and the waiter argued with me over this
A server myself, I know this is a big no-no
Dont' go here
At Amour Restaurant, entertainment is king
You will never find a more pleasant hive of fun and jollity, you mustn't be cautious, you must go tonight! Amour restaurant is an experience that most can enjoy, but few can truly appreciate
Aesthetically, it is a subdued temple of surrealism- the wavey red walls fixed with iron-crossed bulkhead lamps bring to mind the works of Rene Magritte and the pages of Gabriel Garcia Marquez
The food has a delicious esoteric quality, but you don't have to be Umberto Eco to enjoy it!
excellent food,cosy,great atmosphere on weekends,great bands
Great to book a party,has a fireplace in restaurant which sets off the room
The owners Pat and John are very friendly and can often sit and have a beer with you
I feel very happy when I hang out there
Fantastic restaurant
Great decor and great food
There's a 'no' next to Romantic and I disagree
There's a beautiful fireplace and I've gone on several Valentine's Days
Fun bar and good bartenders
Music on weekends
Keep room after dinner for the apple cobbler
Have the Gaelic Steak
One of the best bar burgers in Bay Ridge
Just a damn good bar
We went on a saturday a week after halloween and the windows were still covered with ghost and ghoul decorations
The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive
The food portions were large and tasty
It does not have the feel of an irish pub
The ceiling above the bar is high with chandeliers and we were seated in the back in a red booth
We were promptly moved to avoid the dart board for the noisy regulars

Hot chocolate is disgusting
Desserts are quite good
Had brunch there a few times and the huevos was a little runny but edible
The owner person is very nice and the wait staff are also really nice people
Overall, highly recommended - very cool and casual hang-out
Menu could use an update
More than anything, I like the fact that I don't have to have to glam up and have my Jennifer Lopez hair on when I go here - just cool, and relaxed yet hip - really GREAT for us chill downtowners! PS - saw David Schwimmer from Friends there one Sunday morning
Awesome variety of brunch entrees
Not a high maintenance place, come here to relax and catch up with friends
Never had a problem getting seated
The food is pretty good and the prices are very very reasonable
Next to Walker's, the nicest staff and atmosphere in Tribeca
It's just a lovely place, don't go if you are some bratty type on a high-anxiety date
Go to relax, sit around for hours and read a book
Comfy restaurant with neighborhood charm
Food is served simply but quickly with a smile
Went for a hamburger with the boyfriend and got shoved in the corner table between 2 different large families
I can see how Edward's has coolness (the front bar scene was hot!), but the rear dining area was packed with pretentious and snobby tribeca parents and their bratty young kids
We prayed that the food would come fast so we could get out of there but, alas, the service was dreadfully slow
We drowned our pain in house red wine which was good
Despite the noise and claustrophobia, the food was actually very good
I'll give it a try again, after the kids go to bed though
Very similar decor as Les Halles
Nice american bistrot decoration
Tasteless burgers but good steack
Insipid staff
Have had brunch here twice and both times it was great
Good service, decent prices and a very good atmosphere
Comfortable place to eat with kids or with a date from the night before
Edward's has quickly become my favorite spot to grab dinner
It's inexpensive and has GREAT comfort food
The burgers rock, the fries are some of the best I've had in nyc, and the chicken sandwich is the best I've ever had - period
The wait staff is always friendly, the drinks are great and the specials are perfect
I couldn't ask for much more from a cozy neighborhood spot
The Scene Flanked by a diner-style bar on one side and glass cases of sweets on the other, General Store resembles a cozy mom-and-pop rest stop on the way through Pennsylvania Dutch country--minus the cheesy gift shop
Modern Americana pipes in via stereo, with Wilco tunes sprinkled among Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson croon-alongs
The Food Everything here, from the wine and beer to the pecan pie, is made in the USA
Start with the cheese plate, featuring expert homeland varieties dressed up with toasted hazelnuts, or sample the homey tomato soup, served with "cheesy fingers" (a grilled cheese sandwich sliced into strips)
Save room for the lobster pot pie, a sweet stew of winter vegetables and Maine's finest export, topped with a cloud-like puff pastry
and sooo much better
It might be rated for its desserts but the brunch is amazing
just the right combinations to remind you of home while keeping you in NYC
The bisuits are great - and I'm not a biscuit fan
maybe I'll convert
And they serve Cafe du Monde
need I say more?
This place was pretty good
I was a little upset because they no longer have their mac n' cheese, but overall the food was good
Not the best comfort food I've had, but good
I highly suggest leaving room for dessert
Highlight of the meal!
This is one of my favorite restuarants in New York
Pure comfort food with gourmet twist
But it is always delicious
The atmosphere is terrific: comfortable and familiar
It feels like you just invited some friends over brunch
The hot chocolate, in particular, MUST be ordered
In sum, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
I'm a completely happy returning brunch customer! I come as often as my funds will allow, with at least a friend or two for brunch
It's never a let down
Just look around the room
Every person seems to be enjoying themselves, with the exception of the occasional unhappy child or cranky old person
The food is consistent and deliscious
Dinner has been great on the two occasions I've been
It's a home away from home
Warm, comfortable and inviting! Keep up the good work!
Brunch experience: The absolute worst steak eggs - meager strips of fatty meat, eggshells that were broken into my eggs, a dry biscuit
Not cheap at $10, either
Mimosas made using weak sour orange juice - completely wrong for the champagne
Ambience fun and lively; however the booth seat is way too high and makes uneven seating with your dining partner across from you
Waitress was friendly but neglected to bring us water until requested
at the General store
We stuffed ourselves on deliscious American tappas and then split the beefy mac cheese
It was sooooo good
Had a house salad for dessert because of all the carbs we ate, but it was worth it
Can't wait to go back!
GOOD FOOD, GOOD FRIENDS, WHAT MORE COULD I WANT! HAD A GREAT TIME AT THE GENERAL STORE
WE'LL BE BACK FOR MORE
AWESOME BOTTLE OF FRANSISCAN MERLOT AND A ROCKING CHEESE PLATE
DESSERT OF BROWNIE SUNDAE AND A HAPPY HOUR POPSICLE MADE THE EVENING PERFECT! YEAH!
Sorry Mom, your cooking was never this good
What a friendly, warm little place
I came a few times and the food is consistantly great
Don't be fooled, it's not gormet,but it very well done comfort, home food
The roast chicken is so tender and juicy, the meat loaf is flavorful and never dry, the mac cheese is no immitation cheese dish, it's rich and not over-cheesed with a delicious meat sauce on top and my favorite is the lobster roll
Lobster chopped and seasoned perfectly
Desserts have been awsome when I've had room
All my dinning partners have been thankful I brought them here
Very interesting and deliscious beers and wines!
Why this place gets so many great reviews really baffles me
Let me put it this way: we just ordered two orders of macaroni and cheese and two orders of mashed potatoes
For mashed potatoes we got a scoop of plain, tasteless, cold spuds
The macaroni and cheese, well, it's not macaroni, it's penne pasta
The pasta is undercooked and get this, cheeseless
Oh, yeah, they do sprinkle some parmesan cheese on it
enough to flavor it
And you want to know how much we paid for this order? $35
00
They're out of their minds!
What a cute place

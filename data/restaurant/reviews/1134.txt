My wife and I decided to try the place out
As we gingerly walked in we were greeted by the host, who was quite well dressed
The inside of the diner was very well designed
there was a unique blend of orange and light blue colors
My wife and I ordered crabcakes and chicken springrolls for appetizers
and a seafood paella for diner
Whoa
what a plethora of food
did I mention it was delicious! Not to mention I found out they have a WiFi hotspot for your wireless laptop
Price was just right and service was excellent
and of course, with a smile
I will definitly come back
and not haphazardly
This diner has the coolest atmosphere, even better food, great service, and did I say the best diner i EVER went to!!!! I loved that the menu choices were so different! I go there as much as I can
If you go defintely try the little corn breads and the lo mein!! (It was better at POP than in a Chinese restaurant
) And let me not forget to mention that the portions are HUGE!
Although I order from here often due to lack of choices that deliver, the sit down service and pretty bad and 4/5 times we don't get our full order
It's just a diner, nothing more - don't let the new scenery fool you
We loved Sage and are pretty disappointed that it isn't here anymore
Went here last saturday and was extremely surprised at how good the food is
they have a huge variety of dishes
But, I stuck with a classic hamburger with fries
Service was nice too
I would def be back
The Scene Saffron-colored walls, arched windows, textured tiling, comfy booths and a relaxed, convivial buzz set the tone in both the bar and small dining room
Service knows what to recommend and the dishes arrive at the perfect pace
The Food Though the spot takes its name from a popular Spanish cartoon, Chef Diego Gonzales's cooking is serious
Just when you think you've found a favorite, a new dish arrives to wow your palate: light and moist egg-potato combo of tortilla Espanola or crispy, melty ham and bechamel croquettes, or potato chunks in an intensely layered romesco sauce
Seafood comes off just as well, with a smoky blend of garlic, white wine, pepper and parsley lending a stewy depth to shrimp, and paprika brightening tender chunks of octopus
No dessert is offered; all the better, however, to finish off your Albarino with the first-rate platter of Spanish cheeses

we have spent our saturday night at this busy restaurant
The place was jam packed
They had beautiful outdoor seating
theey were so nice and accomodating
The service was attentive not boring and pushy
the food was excellent
our whole party enjoyed every little thing
I loved this little tapas bar
don't waste your time
the service was absolutely awful
we were completely ignored and left without ever getting served or being acknowledged on a saturday night when there were empty tables, you do the math
Wow, I have not had tapas that good in a long time! I heard good reviews they were actually true! The croquetas, garlic shrimp, razor clams, chorizo et al were amazing
can't go wrong with anything on the menu
House cocktails were limited but the wines are nice
Worth the trip to Williamsburg! Staff was very laid back attentive
Cute decor nice ambience! This one is a winner a keeper
I totally agree with another review in the long list (ARE YOU KIDDING ME) Where have you eaten before It was so overpriced the food would not even be enough to feed my little baby cat
(3 mini sausages cut them in halves to make the illusion of six?) The services was not apropiated for a place which pretend to be so fancy
The waitress was dress in pajamas or so
Last thing, what is the point of having dining room if you not even have dinner to serve
We spent a big amount in just ten minutes just to have to go to a real restaurant to have dinner
Dear owner(s): You guys are definitely trying too hard
What I mean by that is that you are entering all reviews yourselves
What a bunch of loosers!!! Hey if your restaurant is not good enough don't you think people will notice
da! You don't have to be super smart to figure it out
Do great cooking and the excellent reviews will come themselves
but don't think that citysearch users are stupid
please
excellent tapas,great service,great sangria,so cozy and so europian
loved the place
highly recommend it
will go back
we were there last night with a couple of friend from williamsburg whom highly talk about this tapas bar
since they have been there before first they wanted to order from the specials
we tried lazor clams,jumbo scallops,fried baby herring, salted cured tuna
and much more ,,then we move in to the menu
they have so many options
feels like you wanted to eat the all menu
so we have to take more trips over here
and i am definatelly going there for st
valentines day to try the special tapas menu
and do not forget to order chocolate souffle
definately best in town
much better then jean george's
I was hearing about this tapas bar from catalan friends
finally made it to go there
only 20 minutes from Manhattan
and such a discovery make to wonder there is no tapas place in Manhattan
After you eat here you will forget Tia pol or Casa Mono even Ripert's new joint Barca 18
Theit tapas menu far creative and tasty then these places
The place is very cozy
Every detail is so cute
Tortilla was top notch,lomo de cerdo was excellent,montaditosfilet mignon carpacio ,their chocolate souffle
I do not think i have enough space to express
So I will leave it to you
Just go there and try the food and experience how the Spanidh food suppose to be
WE HAD A EXCELLENT CHRISTMAS GATHERING IN THIS LOVELY SPOT
FOOD WAS FANTASTIC

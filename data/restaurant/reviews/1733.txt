STAY AWAY from this joint
Rude, dishonest people who don't stand by their product
Excellent wait staff, friendly, the meatballs are as large as softballs
good greek seasoning
great choice on menu
great for breakfast
get the cornbeef/eggs
real orange juice
just a delight to revisit
clean location
radio cabs parked right outside
and the water was not $11
00
I have to admit, this might be the best late night diner in the city
While Surf and Turf might not be available at 6 a
m
, the french toast and fries are a close second
Oh, and the turkey omelet is a must, but don't forget the cheese
Unless you plan on getting a bagel, because they give you about 2 pounds of cream cheese
And if you are lucky, they will bring you a nice house salad at no charge
Ask for Frankie
He is the best waiter in town
And it is cheap
$11 for a glass of water- Who could resist?
First visited Mexico Lindo in 1981
25 years later still my favorite
Staff is GREAT especially Frank
Food is fantastic, my personal favorites are Ropa Vieja and Fajita
Best flan I have ever had
Top off with a 43 on the rocks and you've had a perfect dining experience
We've had 80TH birthday party and an Engagement Party 15+ people and we were treated like royalty
Jose sings everything from Beatles to Bseme Mucho
Often enjoyed conversation with other diners
very friendly clientele
Food is delicious, drinks are too (however, Margaritas seem at bit pricey @ $ 10
00 each)
Great atmosphere, wonderful service, older crowd
The street-side table seating is a little cramped but tolerable, if you like to people watch while you chow down!
i grow up eating in Mexico lindo restaurant and the food is very good and the people are very frienly
When I first moved to NYC over five years ago, one of the first restaurants that I went to was Mexico Lindo
I have eaten in many Mexican restaurants over the past five years here in the city, and this continues to be my favorite
Simply the best food, service, and margarita's you will find in NYC
Oh those margarita's! I have introduced many friends to this hidden jewel, and now they are hooked too
Last year my friends through my birthday party here for me
Everything about ML is wonderful! Go today, you will not be dissapointed
I used to work in the area and was taken to Mexico Lindo Restaurant for lunch by a friend
I have been hooked ever since (going on fifteen years)
The restaurant is great for lunch meetings and celebrating birthdays in the evenings
MEXICO LINDO HAS BEEN AT THE SAME PLACE FOR OVER 30 YRS
1 BUSINESS, 1 FAMILY
THAT ALONE SAYS SOMETHING FOR BEING A GREAT MEXICAN RESTAURANT
ONCE A CUSTOMER YOULL ALWAYS BE A CUSTOMER
THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS, THE FROZEN MARGARITAS; THE BEST!!TRY A MIXTURE OF WHITE/RED EXCELLENTE
TOTAL BRAIN FREEZE!
Ive been coming here for years! It is the best mexican restaurant no one knows about! The service is excellent, the help is the friendlist and the food is EXCELLENT! Oh and who can forget the frozen margaritas! (Hint: Ask the waiter to mix the regular and the strawberry) YOU MUST GO THERE!
This place is great! It's one of those unknown restaurants that's great
The food is fabulous and they have wonderful Sangria! I definitely recommend it
A bit overpriced for the portions and quality, but the food is consistently good
For those unafraid of cholesterol, you must try the Mexican fondue with chorizo
The decor is fine, nothing spectacular, and the service is generally very friendly
All-in-all, I say give it a whirl
so much I never go anywhere else
I am surrounded by Mexican restaurants in my neighborhood and I always go back here
Family owned and family recipes make it authentic and quality meals
I love the mole dishes the best
Its also a pretty restaurant that often has live music
Wonderful
Just wonderful
Not a complaint
This family run find is amazing
This is a very nice Italian place with very good service, but the food is only slightly above par
The good thing is they have carbonara, but for some reason it's made with proscuitto instead of pancettta
I really liked the space a lot, except for the huge (and probably cheap) painting on one side of the wall
The service and the owners are super friendly, and I recommend the appetizers in general
this place is so unpretentious, it's hard to believe it's just 10 blocks south of murray hill
my best friend and i went in one night and split two amazing pasta dishes
we enjoyed two yummy meals (although smaller portions than we expected) and embraced the value, taste and chillness of the place
no scene here, so next time i can leave my heels at home and throw on a pair of sneakers
how great!!!!
My husband and I popped in one night for appetizers only
The guy who seated us was wearing a strange tee-shirt/thermal underwear combination
The calamari was over fried and quite chewy but the salad I had was ok
The ambiance is nice, but I wouldn't call it romantic as it's too bright and loud
Maybe the entrees are better than the app's
Casa Mia is an out-of-the way local, but nothing extraordinary
My appetizer of Polenta with gorgonzola was OK, a bit on the bland side
The entree was poached salmon with tomato, zucchini and something else
Good, except that part of the salmon tasted terrible
You know, one of those bruised parts or something, smelled like low tide
It was only a small part, but *whew*, what a stinker
Service was pleasant, but server never checked up on me once, had to flag her down for help
Busboys were good
Small room, loud, too brightly lit
Not cozy in a comfortable sense, just small
High ceilings make for lousy acoustics
If you walk past one day, stop in
Otherwise, I doubt it's worth a trip
Coziest restaurant I've been to in a long time
Small place, good food, comfortable setting, classic atmosphere
You would want to go again and again

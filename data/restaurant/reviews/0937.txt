Just a few tables and a full bar area fit into the narrow basement space
The small staff is knowledgeable and very friendly
The Food Grotto's chef has a sure, delicate hand, turning out dishes with discrete flavors that harmonize splendidly
An appetizer of crostini topped with chunky shrimp salad is smoky and complex; another starter of potato croquettes is likewise delicious and subtle
The restaurant's outdoor grill is used to excellent effect, producing highbrow dishes like perfectly medium-rare grilled tuna with spicy chard, and lowbrow plates like a dense, ultra-flavorful hamburger
An excellent beef pizzaiola abounds with tomato tang, and black linguine arrabbiata is amply portioned and piquant
Lackluster desserts are the single disappointment
don't mind the earlier posting - this sweet spot has a new chef in the kitchen
get in now before the word gets out and you can't get a seat
This place is a real find, I can't belive I only discover it now
There are two cozy rooms with different atmosphere and lighting and an amazing back garden right in the heart of the LES
The food is absolutely wonderful
I highly recommend the Caprese di Bufala as well as the Zuppa di Pesce
Heavenly! The selection of wine is Italian and the Valpolicella Ripasso is delicious
The waitstaff is not only knowledgeable and helpful but also extremely friendly
This place is unique in every way
Over-priced, subpar food, served by an unfriendly, slow staff
There are so many (in fact, way too many) amazing places on the LES for you to waste your time here
I wasted $12 on an order of pasta no bigger than my fist, my friend spent $24 on a pork chop too fatty to finish or digest
After calling the restaurant to see if it was okay to bring a cake for my friend's b-day, the staff tried to charge us $24 for a cake fee
NO WAY
I will NEVER be eating here again
The food was delicious there when i went about 1/2 a year ago
going back for my birthday next week
hopefully we can try the tasting menu
its a great deal
Just the best dining experience! The staff was wonderful, and the food to die for
I had my boyfriend's 30th birthday dinner at Grotto on Saturday night and it was a wonderful experience! I met with the owner, David, a few days before the big night and he was amazing
I had 3 bottles of champagne waiting on the table, the waitress was very helpful, all 15 guests were very pleased and we couldn't have asked for a better night dining outside in the lovely garden
Thanks for making it such a memorable evening!
Very good lighting
Nice decor
Looking forward to trying the garden seating when it gets a little warmer
go on Saturday night for the wild boar stew
fantstic
A friend recommended the restaurant and last Friday we decided to go and now I regret not having gone sooner
The food was spectacular and the service was superb
I loved dealing with a knowledgeable wait staff and even had the pleasure of meeting the gracious and fabulous Chef
Anyone who wants 5 star treatment should definitely go and enjoy the Grotto experience
I know I will be back
Despite being a small restaurant, it's very cozy
The atmosphere is great, with a few red bulbs lighting up the place
The service was excellent, the waiter who served us was very polite and helpful
The lobster revioli I ordered was very satisfying
It's a quiet place that serves great food with a friendly ambience
It's however not a good restaurant for a large group of friends, but excellent for you and a date
this resaurant is quickly becoming a favorite of mine and all my friends, its cozy, romantic, friendly and neighborly, all at the same time
the regular menu is stellar, and the daily specials are frequently impressive as well
the newly redone desert menu is also great
make sure you call ahead, as the small table space gets booked up quickly, especially in the colder days when the garden is closed
in warm weather however, a few mojitos in the garden are perfect way to relax into the evening
Wide open space yet tables tiny enough to barely fit your plates
The wait staff, a young, cold and unfriendly group appear as if they just returned from a funeral
The miso soup was bland as were the chicken yakitori
The sushi was not that fresh and smaller then average
The tuna was too soft and the yellowtail lacked in any flavor
The eel was over charred with the sauce on top too thick and salty
The beef teryaki was bland as well
No wonder it wasn't that crowded for a Saturday night in Chelsea
Go across town for better Japanese
The Scene Warmth oozes from all sides of this Mexico-inspired eatery
An expansive wooden patio leads to a covered seating area, and then to an intimate dining room with a fireplace
Neighborhood folks gather at the wooden tables; service wavers from friendly to nonchalant
The Food For starters, try the guacamole served with fried plantains and precariously stacked nachos, which succeed at satisfying that munchy Tex-Mex craving
After appetizers, the menu takes two directions: cheap taco-stand eats and more expensive entrees
From the stand, choose tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas or burritos--all satisfy with tender meat and generous serving size, although salsas for topping must be ordered separately
Entrees take on multiple incarnations
The sweet pineapple salsa almost overpowers the steak fajitas, and the veggie tamale lacks flavor, though a lively side of palm salad helps
Skip dessert and order another strong margarita instead
This place is brilliant
Oozing ultra cool atmousphere; warm, friendly, relaxed and funky environment
A wide choice of appetisers and entres - we tried nearly everything and it was all delicious, even managed to squeeze in a tasty key lime pie for desert
Ohhh, and the margaritas were amazing!! We went there as a family group, but would also be cool for couples and groups of friends
Try it soon
You'll be sure of a great evening out whatever the occasion
PS leave yourself enough time to try Trout, the new funky outside bar next door
I've heard all the complaints about food and staff at this place, and perhaps some people have had an unfortunate encounter with the host or a cranky waiter
We have too, but we still go there, consistently, because the margaritas are wicked strong, delicious and only $6, the food can be so friggn' good, and without a doubt it's filling, and the atmosphere is unbeatable
It's just so cool inside and out
Cranky host or servers aside, it's easy to see that they are jammed almost every night, especially in summer, and so, you know, they're busy
I waited tables in this city for 8 years, it ain't easy
But this is their 4th summer here, I think, and they're going strong
Relax, have a drink, and get over yourselves
Oh, and have the Fish Tacos
Delish!
The food is cheap and only slightly better than cardboard, but the patio is great! The screaming kids don't make it any better, go late when the kiddies are gone
Love the margaritas
love the guacamole
love the ribs! Pacifico is a great place to grab drinks and/or have appetizers and dinner
They have a nice outdoor patio and can accomodate groups
I like that the place has good drinks, good food, and great service while still keeping it very casual, homey, and not pretentious
I have no idea what all the bad service reviews are talking about -- we were seated quickly, and service was both prompt and polite
The food was delicious, and the price was right, especially for downtown Brooklyn ($50 for 2 people, including apps, drinks, tax, and tip, and we both left full)
Highly recommend the salmon stack and anything from the taco stand section of the menu
as a former resident of mexico d
f
i actually find this place rather pleasant
the food meets my needs
it may not be off the boat mexican, but it beats some of the other places in this city
the staff is a little gruff, but this is new york, pull your weight

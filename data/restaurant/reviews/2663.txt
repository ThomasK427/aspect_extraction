The beer list is ridiculous, if you are looking to try new things, definitely go here
My last visit to Adobe, turned my previous feeling of like for the restaurant, to LOVE
I like the beer selection, the service, and the food
I like the live music, but it can be too loud to talk over
I LOVE the salads
I don't have a lot of options, as a vegetarian -- but I bet they would make changes to accommodate
Generally I'm satisfied with whatever dish I have, so long as I add guacamole
But the last time I was there: the FIRE-ROASTED VEGETABLE ROLL Special was so incrediblly delicious, that although I was full before even entering the restaurant, expecting to take 75% of my meal home in a doggy bag-- I couldn't help myself but to devour every last piece!  And the french fries -- they're pretty excellent, too!  If they made that Special a regular dish -- I'd go there much more often
I went here one night with my boyfriend and another couple for some drinks and was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the extensive beer/microbrew menu, the best I've seen on SI
The atmosphere was great, very southwest in feeling (but not artifical, like at a chain restaurant), which again, is a departure from the typical restaurants on SI
That night there was live music, a young guy on guitar playing, you guessed it, BLUES
The entire experience made me nostalgic for my college days in Colorado
Can't wait to go back and actually eat some of the yummy Mexican food! The name says it all!
The is a wonderful haven for good food for an Island that is inudated with Italian Food resturants
I recommended the whole menu to anyone who likes mexican and can not stand the chain mexican resturants
You will love it
Went to the Cargo recently for Sunday brunch and waited for OVER AN HOUR to get our food
Seems it was busy and the waitress simply forgot about us
It was incredible! Been going to The Cargo for years and support it's whole vibe and all but COME ON!! Just because the waitress is cute doesn't mean she can actually wait tables! I could give a scratch about attractive wait staff
this I implore you
HIRE STAFF WITH A CLUE!!! I want to be a customer but I can't bare the service!
I have been going to the Cargo for well over 5 years and in the good old days (when the staff all wore black button down shirts) you not only got a fantastic meal but the service was impeccible
Dinner remains a fairly good experience but Sunday brunch has taken a severe nose dive when it comes to service
I have given it several chances in recent months, but my friend and I always leave very disapointed
We are all but forgotten at our table after our intitial order is placed, and if we want anything extra it takes almot a degree in semifore to flag down one of the very inattentive wait staff
It even took tens minutes to get our check after we were well done with our meal
The cef is great, pity he isn't supported by a better wait staff
'going to Cargo for 10+ yrs
It was my elder brother's local, and then mine
Now, neither of us live in the neighborhood, but we always return
I can go there on my own for a quiet meal or just a drink
For time to myself, I'll sit at a table
To converse with old friends, or make new ones, I join the bar
It's funny that people criticize the place for attitude
Are those people New Yorkers? Don't take it personally
Once you get past the initial gruffness, you'll find smiles and good laughs
Appreciate sincerity, not exaggerated, fake niceties
Some of the entrees can be pricey
But sandwiches and appetizers are a good deal
They have live jazz 1-2/wk
Trivia Night
And other music on occasion
The servers are excellent
They work extremely hard in a sometimes chaotic environment
You should be lucky if they befriend you
If you like an ecclectic crowd and an overall good time where you and your friends can get together whether it be to eat, drink or just play some good old pictionary (they provide crayons and a blank white sheet at every table), go to the Cargo! The menu is a bit different and all of the selections are pretty tasty
it's such a mixed crowd and you definitely feel as though you are removed from the typical staten island setting which is very refreshing
Not only is the owner a jerk, the staff has an attitude problem as well
They ignore your requests and all seem like they are on PMS
The food is not all that great and definately not a bargain
The owner has a bad attitude

you should be happy that I acknowledges your existence
while he sits at the bar and gloats  kinda attitude
Oh and the chicken Rollards are the bomb
No one beats their Chicken Mei Fun
ask for for it with no bean sprouts
The sushi was definitely good, but the waitress is a little weird
She seemed to be in a bad mood when you asked her for something and when I was leaving I asked her for a take home menu and she gave me one that looked like it was in the garbage
If the people that worked there weren''t so miserable this restaurant would be great
The cute little japanese room is adorable
Food is good if you need a quick sushi fix and don't feel like driving into the city
The place is really cute and the service is very good but there's nothing creative about the menu
So, if you want something more creative then I would advise you to drive into the city but if you want to stay local this is a good place to start out with
This restaurant has no atmosphere whatsoever, unless you call a few posters of Spain hung up on otherwise bare white walls decorative
I ordered the stuffed mushrooms and stuffed trout, both stuffed with crabmeat that tasted rank! Our server lamely offered a free after-dinner drink to make up for it after he failed to even ask how the food was once it was served
The garlic shrimp appetizer was pretty good, however (at least relatively) and the pitchers of sangria are good and cheap
I recommend this place only if you want to take your grandparents to get sloshed and you can always fill up on bread and butter
My friends introduced me to Brothers a while back and I have had some of the best pizza in NY in the city
Brother's is better than them all
Easily
There is no question
Pan slices are great, sicilian are amazing
The grandma slice is absolutely out of this world
I've tried the hero's, the pasta and the soup there and everything is always good
As a 25 year resident of Staten Island, I have experiencied the best pizzeria's that this borough has to offer
My first choice for Sicilian Pizza is Brother's
A Saturday afternoon ritual, I visit this establishment for the best Sicilian (square) slice of pizza in the area
There usually is a short wait for a fresh pie out of the oven
and it's always worth the wait! Their relatively recent introduction of a version of the Sicilian pie is called the Grandma pie featuring a thin crust, much sauce, with less cheese, and chopped Basil
WOW!!!  Brother's has found yet another way to improve upon the age old Italian way of creating the perfect slice!!! Two words to sum it all up
Get there!!! My compliments

The Scene Run by the original founders and their descendants since 1937, this working-class tavern caters to people on and off Staten Island, including Brooklynites and folks from Bayonne, a short bridge ride away
Families abound, often with small children in tow
Decor is strictly utilitarian, and service--most likely by a member of the extended family--is friendly, brisk but unhurried
The Food Oh, what a pie! Dissect the 16-inch plain rounds, and every component measures up: the thin yet supportive bread-dough crusts, tangy rich red sauce and cheese so gooey it oozes right off the edges of the pan
If you go for toppings, sausage is a good choice, as are a springtime bounty of fresh, crisp vegetables
Or opt for a white pie: sauceless cheese over a layer of sweet onions, sprinkled with olive oil
The restaurant serves heros and platters as well, but face it: You're here for the pizza
Awesome pizza, though the service could use a little bit of help
I would like to go there every week, but I'll get FAT!! It's worth the wait, but that's becasue the place is very popular
Besides, there's a cd jukbox, a bar and they're always showing the local teams on the tv's
I am absolutely amazed at how perfect the crust on this pie is made
For a serious fan of thin slice pizza, Denino's tops everyone in and around NYCNY
We ordered a sauage and pepper pie and 2 of us at the whole huge thing
It was spectacular
The night before I unloaded 70 bucks for an awesome meal, but this pizza pie at Denino's will forever stay in my memory as the best damned pizza around
WITH MY SWEETIE MARGARITA IN THERE
WHAT MORE CAN I SAY

Bring the kids, bring the whole family
You'll know why
WHEN YOU EAT AT RIZZO ITALIAN VILLAGE YOU COULD STILL TASTE THE FOOD FOR DAY
THERE STUFFED LOBSTER IS UNBELEIVABLE
I HAVE HAD LOBSTER IN FINISTIST RESTAURANTS IN MANHATTAN AND I NEVER TASTED IT AS GOOD AS RIZZO
THE PLACE IS PRETTY THE SERVICE IS GREAT AND IT IS VERY REASONABLE
The food at this place is phenomenal
The spaghetti with ricotta cheese is hands down my favorite thing on the menu and I am big fan of the house wine
Garlic bread here is addictive
I recommend this place too for big groups and down home atmosphere
Yum!
i went to rizzo's italian village last night, and it was better than ever! this is a childhood fave of mine, and i am happy to report that the food is as rich and succulent as ever! try the shrimp diavolo, the baked ziti is a classic! don't skimp on the generous portions of homemade wine the tasty garlic bread cut in thick slices
i was full all day today from the meal last night - can't wait to go back :)
As the other reviewer's have mentioned, Rizzo's has been a mainstay on 21st street for 50 years
The food is great, the service is excellent and the same family has been running the show since the beginning
The garlic bread is superb as is the lobster
If you like fresh Italian food, rich, thick sauces and the best seafood and chops in the city, you won't want to miss this place
I went there for my anniversay 10 years ago and I've been going back ever since
I especially love the baked ziti
It's just like my Italian grandmother used to make
Also, try the lobster for two
The price is just right and it really should be for three because it's so big!
I first went with a hungry friend in one late afternoon
I had focaccia sandwich while my friend had grilled chicken mushroom rissotto
In the beginning I thought the price was a bit high for a local diner
But turned out the food was unexpectedly delicious (risotto was tastier than sandwich, if you have a big appetite)
I'm not a rice person but their risotto was so good that I had returned for a couple times ordering just it until one time I started to venture into the pasta section, and I haven't been disappointed once
I especially like their pastas in red sauce
I live in the neighborhood
It's the place I go when I want to reward myself with great hearty food
One thing to warn you: their pasta portions are big
I never left the restaurant without having to bring home a doggy bag
I haven't tried their brunch, partly because their coffee is a bit weak to me
(frankly, bel air makes better coffee so I usually go there for brunch)
I never paid much attention, then one night I got a flu and needed warm soup on the way home
Thier chicken soup cured my flu! (Well, and some cold medication, but that's another story)
Great place for midnight snack
I love thier beer selections too
I save this place for treat to myself
I haven't tried brunch yet, but late night snack is good to go
Good quality food, large variety and good service
Brunch on the weekends is particularly good
One of the best restaurants in the neighborhood
I live blocks away and eat here all the time
Amazing food, great value
did I mention that they deliver for free? AND THE BANANAS XANGOS WILL MAKE YOUR KNEES WEAK!!
I've eaten here numerous times since moving here and I'm never disappointed
The food is original and incredibly tasty
The service is friendly and the prices are excellent
It looks like just your average diner on the outside, but the food is that of a more upscale restaurant
which is why i go there so often! everything i have there is delicious
personal faves are the fabulous tomato soup, the authentic greek salad and delicious focaccia bread sandwiches
the prices are right and i strongly recommend this place for any time of day: early breakfast or late night snack
Wineturtle just loves what this family has done
When Dad was at the helm he ran simply put the best 24 hour diner in Western Queens
When his to sons joined the mix they took Dads quest for the best food another step adding slowly to the menu a host of items that reflect the demigraphic of this still growing nabe
Greek Glasswine is still on menu along side good value bottle selections fromaround the world
A beautiful bottle of Mouton Cadet in 5 liter size graces the counter
Simply put the sons now run the best up scale diner in Western Queens,I hope it never changes its look as it is a reflection of one familys growth along with their neighborhood
PS the 4am hot turkey sand is still a wineturtle fav
Brunch a close second
Sanford's is way better than Bel Air Diner
I have never had a bad meal at Sanfords
They always have really good soups and their entree items are large and tasty! And who can resist their late night disco fries???
This place is definitely a good place to stop in for a quick bite to eat any time of the day
It certainly doesn't put a big dent in your wallet as well
Some portions are big, some are small, so try different things to see what fits your fancy/appetite
If your looking for Manhattan Cuisine in Astoria you will find it at this place
This ex-diner has revamped their menu to cater to the manhattan clientelle in astoria
Risotto's, Sushi Tuna, wasabi aioli, Steak Frite, and the Best weekend Brunch in Queens

5 different benedicts
excellent food at reasonable prices
and very congenial staff
i highly reccomend it any time of the day
and it is open 24 hours
this is an amazing restaurant
the dishes of the day are out of this world, especially the pastitsio and the koupepia(cypriot version of the stuffed grape leaves)
there are as great as my mother's, if not better! this place has everything your heart desires
it's fresh, delicious, affortable and generous portions
i highly recommend it
The food is excellent
You will never see such a decoration in another restaurant in NYC
There is live Greek music every wednesday, something that you must not miss
The Scene  Chief among the neighborhood's bustling cafes is Kolonaki, with its inviting upstairs space, replete with rich, dark wood tables and windowsills
French windows entirely fill two of the walls ,and the ceilings are high, giving the place an airy feel--even at night, when it's well-lit with artsy wall lamps
The crowd tends to the diverse--from young and hip to old and doddering--perhaps in testimony to what a great place this is to while away the day
The Food  Kolonaki serves up everything from a European tuna sandwich (made with tuna, lemon juice, capers, parsley, onions, carrots, olive oil and basil) to scrumptious specialty desserts
Beer and wine are also offered, alongside fine cognacs and cordials and other assorted drinks
The service is great, but watch out for that whipped cream! If you don't specify that you don't want a mountain of whipped cream on your cappuccino, expect to be buried in it
I get my mochachino everyday from Kolonaki and they are just the best
Also try the hot chocolate because this is the only place that uses real chocolate chunks and milk (not water)
I also recommend the lemonade which is made with real lemons
For dessert you must try the baklava, chocolate mousse cake, strawberry shortcake
The grilled chicken sandwich and the ceaser salad is amazing
Not only is the food and drink amazing at this place so is the atmosphere(especially in the spring and summer)
The service is great

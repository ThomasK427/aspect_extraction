Went here for a friend's birthday--we have a group of 8, not too large
The cactus margaritas are very good, as is the guacamole, but for people who enjoy good mexican food, there are much better places in NYC
Only go here if you have more money than you know what to do with because it is very very expensive--not at all a value and nothing special
Will not go again
i went to dos caminos soho with friends
the margaritas were great! the bartenders were friendly
had an appetizer at the bar
the plantain empanadas were excellent
we sat outside and even though it was chilly we were comfortable because there were outdoor heaters
there was a lot of street noise, the street lights gave everything a weird orange glow
our waitress wasn't friendly and service was slow
i had the pork dish
was ok
bland with too many onions
would have been nice for veggies or salad to be included with entrees
we had chocolate fondue dessert
great! seems like dos caminos is more focused on their scene and their drinks
the food wasn't really anything special considering the price
i think there are better places for dinner
stick with dos caminos for drinks (if you don't mind $12 margaritas) and appetizers
not really worth having dinner there
Finally great Mexican food in New York! Creative and authentic at the same time
the ribeye steak is amazing!! Great service and ambience too, not a better spot for people watching anywhere
Be sure to try the Prickly Pear cactus margarita!
Probably the worst service I ever experienced in this city
We should have walked out when the host forgot to seat us while waiting right behind him at the bar drinnking the watered-down sangria
It took the waiter 20 minutes to come over to the table take our order, and nevers brings us our appetizer
Our food was cold (not to mention mediocre at best), and the complimentary drinks that are part of the meal were added to our check along with the appeziter that we never got
I will make Dos Caminos SoHo a place I dine for years to come
I have been a couple times this summer and have had nothing but wonderful experiences
The food tasted fresh, and the server gave us wonderful suggestions
She recommended the Tuna and Seabass which were both very tasty
The guacamole is not to be missed, and the service is by far some of the best in soho, not to mention manhattan
Although the restaurant was full, she took the time to answer our questions about their extensive teqila list, never rushed us, and at the end of the meal took the time to talk about some of the other BR Guest restaurants that my friends from out of town were interested in going to
It was refreshing to see such a young energetic and knowledgable staff in SoHo
Run to Dos Caminos SoHo-NOW!!
I went to Dos Caminos for my birthday with a small group and the food was much better than I expected
The swordfish was delicious and the spiced up guacomole was very tasty
The drinks here are also really good-I had a couple of frozen daquiris that tasted great and got me pretty tipsy
Overall, a nice dining experience and highly reccomended
Fantastic evening
The food was great, the guac is not to be believed simply perfect and the chips are standard good fare
My wife loved her Pork Chop special and the Swordfish with gingered sweet potatoes was very upscale
Desserts were excellent Key Lime Creme Brulee and Warm Banana Crepes! Server was excellent but was bogged down with a large party with a demanding hostess, people kept arriving late, later and still arriving while others were eating
Totally unfair and should not disrupt their regular service to other customers
A dependable stand-by, this place offers good, clean, fresh food, but is hardly authentic
The Mexican Creme Brule has the consistency of cottage cheese
However, the spicy guacamole made right at your table, prickly pear margarita, extensive tequila list, and mariscos tacos are all excellent options! The Soho staff needs service tips from the Park Ave
location
Dos Caminos was an incredible eating experience
A large group of us stumbled upon DC and stopped for Sunday brunch
Not only was the guac the best any of us had had, but the specialty brunch meals came with a great choice of complimentary drinks! We highly recommend the prickly pear margarita and the chicken quesadillas (LOTS of marinated chicken)
Our server was a doll
and the atmosphere very soho
Highly recommend it
I originally reviewed this place and gave it a five
I've been several times since, and had better experiences
The menu has changed, the crowd seems better, and the service is pretty good
Maybe they were working out the kinks
In my opinion, it is one the the best mexican places in the city second to Rosa's (distant second)
I visited Dos Caminos on a Monday night and had a great dining experience
We ate outside and partook in people watching as the location lends itself to it
The tequila selection is very extensive and the margaritas were tasty
I recommend the guacamole starter with some jalapeno pepper on the side
We ordered a selection of appetizers rather than getting one entree each which allowed for a varying selection of tastes
All the food was delicious
Desserts were also good
The layout of the restaurant was excellent, especially with the outside seating
I would imagine it would be tight in the cold weather as there is quite a bit of seating outdoors
It can be pricey but try ordering an appetizer selection if youre looking to save a few bucks
Enjoy
Great food, great drinks, great scene!!! Need I say more!! You should go FAST!!!
Like food with taste? Then don't dine here
Despite the awesome waiter my dining experience was a WASTE OF TIME and $
I ordered a Dos Equis and was told they were out, only to watch not 1, but 2 get served to the table directly across from my party more than once during my dinner
The ribs were barely warm and void of all things resembling taste
The sauce was atrocious, the side dishes none better
Best part of my meal was the Negra Modelo
Rest of my parties dishes were equally bad if not worse
I'd say stop by for drinks only and sit at an outdoor table
Stay as far away from the food as possible (esp
the $12 guac which does not deserve to be served in those dope pig bowls)
I simply can not understand how Dos received even the modest rating it did!!! Because i like to keep it positive
i'll start with such: i found the service to be some of the best in SoHo-the staff was polite, relaxed, and not as condescending as other neighboring restrs
The food was no better than a run-of-the-mill Burritoville, the portions are tiny, and the prices are abominable (and i spend a great deal on food) A taco with rice and beans and a marg
ran ~$30 ($12 for the taco, 8 for the rb, 10 fir the drink) plus tax and a very deserved tip
Everything i ordered was bland and the drink completely watered down!!!!! Guac was $12 and not as good (or generous) as other top rated mexs
SAVE URE MONEY
SPEND YOUR $40 on Taco Bell--at least you won't be bloated by the pretense Horrible experience
i promise
I heard mixed feelings about this restaurant and thought I should check it out to form my own opinion
One word fantastic! Yeh, it's Soho
Great for people watching which we all secretly love to do
But besides all that, the food was delicous, the staff are friendly and professional and the margarita's are to die for! I recommend the snapper ceviche and the seabass and for dessert the warm chocolate empanada
Keep up the good work guys, we will be back!
Went last Sunday night
The place is much more relaxed than the one on Park Ave
S
The orders got mixed up and the waitress was very strange
The plus is that they have an outside dinning area

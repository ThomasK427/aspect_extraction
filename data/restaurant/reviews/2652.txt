but my family fell in love with the soups
Each was a variation on an old standard, five mushroom soup, tomato soup, corn and shrimp cream soup
Each was a good as it gets
Sarabeth's on the Upper Eastside is a wonderful place to have brunch on the weekend
I have had brunch here many times over the last three years
The french toast is incredible
Expect to wait a long time for a table
To reduce the wait time go early before 11am when it's not crowded yet
Brunch is not cheap here but far from outrageous
Its worth the money
Went with a group of 8ppl for Sunday brunch
After a 20 minute wait, we were finally ushered into a cozy booth
Coffee was immediately served, but additional sugar and milk had to be requested
I had the ALmond encrusted French Toast with Cranberry-Cherry Sauce and it was delicious!!! Not too sweet, just right
almonds sliced thinly
bread a little chewy and soft and the right amount of sauce drizzled on top
Would have to revisit just to try the other things!
My wife and I went to Sarabeth's East for the first time and we were impressed with the food and ambience
The meal was a little pricey, but I guess that is to be expected since it is on the upper east side and it is very popular
I will definitely visit again when I am in NYC
Sarabeth's East at The Hotel Wales is a singular New York experience with delicious food, and attentative service
For lunch, I had the chicken pot pie, fresh iced tea, and a great cup of coffee
The pastry for the chicken pot pie was light and the pot pie tasty and elegant
The servers were very professional
It felt like summer time in the country
Other diners were observed with a variety of sandwichs and bruncheon type lunches which looked wonderful
Highly recommended for a great lunch!
Oh, those jams! Sarabeth's jams are among the best I've ever tasted
Apricadabra, Rosy Cheeks (Strawberry Apple), Strawberry-Raspberry, Peach Apricot
they are so blissful
Not too sweet, full of natural, fresh-picked fruit flavor, super chunky--worth the $9 for a pint Mason jar
I've been living around the area for a while now and I have to say I eat here at least once a week
It's a great restaurant for good cheap eats
The atmosphere is relax enough for when you are by yourself and nice enough to have a group get together with friends
I have been eating here at least once a week for 20 years
The prices can not be beat and the service is lightning fast and friendly
The food is always fresh and is absolutely incredible
It is the quintessential friendly neighborhood chinese joint
A real disappointment
Greasy food in a dingy atmosphere
Very cheap prices - but even so - not worth it
This is by far the BEST chinese food In NY City! My husband and I dine here two times a week!!!! The staff is lighting speed and attentative
Anyone, who says other wise is CRAZY! Only a true gourmand can appreciate the spendid food served at First Wok
Take a chance, and live the expierence
Your mouth, stomach, heart and soul will thank you graciously!  P
S
Tea is FREE!!!
We love this place and go several times a month
The jumbo special margaritas are fantastic; the menu offers some choices besides traditional tacos/enchiladas
Try the garlic shrimp or grilled shrimp salad or the fish specials
Service is prompt and professional and friendly
I love a place where water arrives without my asking repeatedly; here they bring it to the table when you sit down! The outdoor seating on the enclosed sidewalk cafe is the best place to sit and people watch or just enjoy the meal
Highly recommended
It's not Tex-Mex but it is tasty and I have never left the place hungry and/or disappointed
I was first taken to this diner on date and my initial reaction to the place was ,iwl? After settling in, however, I began to realize the charm of this comfort food palace
Knick's has by far, the best burgers, shakes and onion rings a girl could ever hope for
And even though my relationship with this guy didn't last, the one with Knick's lunch East is going two years strong
The sushi at this restaurant is one of a kind
Fish is very fresh and pieces are served in good portions
If you are sushi lover, I definitely recommend to sit at the sushi bar
The veteran chef will not let your expectation down
You might want to try some of the seasonal fish
Also, they serve very traditional japanese food you don't see at other Japanese restaurants
Service is attentive and makes you feel at home
Born and raised in Japan, I would give Sachi a True Japanese Cusine
Marvelous sushi--subtle, precise, preparation, seasoning, and composition
The chef eschews fads and trends; he can do more with a little lemon, salt, ginger, and shisu than most people do with a kitchen full of exotic condiments
Tamago has a perfect texture--showing attention to detail in preparation
Soup is from scratch and you taste the difference
Mackerel and sardines are always perfectly cured based on their fat and moisture content
I have never had a bad dish at Sachi, and I have had many sublime dishes--just stunningly perfect combinations of great fish and simple flavorings, thoughtfully arranged on perfectly prepared rice
Sit at the sushi bar and ask the chef to select your dishes
Sample the selection of sakes
And enjoy  a mom and pop shop run by two of the nicest people you will ever meet, with jazz in the background!  What more could you ask for?
Sachi is a really good sushi restaurant
Your not going to find the huge variety of fish, like in the Sushi District in SOHO, but this qaint neighborhood has it's resident King
They have a few delicious types of toro, and they know how to toast Eel just right
The $ are a little steep, and the place is a dump, but the food is pretty solid
Sachi has good points and bad points
The menu has a very few variety of fish, the same as any grocery store, but the fish is fresh, and served in very large slices
The neighborhood is on the upper East side, near Museum Row, it's quiet, and clean
The rolls are the same as any budget sushi house, and are served far too large, and cannot be eaten in one bite, as sushi is supposed to be consumed, but the rice is generaly kept warm and moist which is a big plus
The staff is friendly and polite, but the restaurant is ragedy and cheap
For a neighborhood restaurant Sachi is pretty good, but they don't have any competition nearby, so they probably won't improve
We have dined at Sachi, either at a table or at the bar at least a dozen times (and probably more) as we live close by and I have NEVER had a lackluster meal there
The sushi and sashimi are reliably fresh and delicious, the service always courteous and cordial and (I don't know what that previous reviewer was talking about) terrific jazz (Parker, Miles, Billie) is invariably playing in the background
Don't come for ambience -- come for food impeccably prepared with care and prices that should make many of the more expensive but obviously inferior sushi dens hang their collective heads in shame
While obviously not in the same class as Blue Ribbon Sushi or Tomoe, Sachi is a great sushi restaurant that many believe to be far superior to Kuruma Zushi, Jewel Bako, and even Yama
They have wonderful Toro of Tuna, Salmon, and Yellow Tail
The staff is pretty good, but the location stinks, way up on the upper, upper East side
If they were in SOHO, in the Sushi District they'd make a ton of money
This is a really good sushi restaurant
Forget overpriced and overtrendy Nobu, Yama, etc
For a good value and probably the best and freshest sushi in town, go to Sachi Rest
Uptown Cottage is a great place to order in from
Everytime I have ordered (over five years) I have enjoyed my meal
The people that work there are always very nice and its a nice neighborhood restaurant
Good chinese and japanese food
I highly recommend ordering in, the restaurant is clean and the wait staff nice but there is no decor
Cheaper than average neighborhood Chinese place

We went there for dinner to celebrate our anniversary, and still cannot get over the impecable service and beautiful romantic decor
Most of all, we were really impressed with the food - it is doublessly one of the best we've ever tasted
Their stuffed chicken breast was unbelievable! If you are a chocolate fan, definitely try one of their homemade specials; i had the chocolate case a la mode and it was magnificent!!!
I've had two special events catered by Caffe on the Green and I have to say they went beyond my expectations
The food is very good to excellent but the ambiance and service are truly extrodinairy
I had my Dad's 70th birthday party there on one of the coldest winter nights; the inside was so cozy by the fireplace and a piano player lended itself to this incredible feeling of warmth
Prior to this occasion, I had a surprise party in the summer and it was another success
I've also had many wonderful dinners here but if you have a special occasion, Caffe on the Green comes through for you on many levels
Kudos to Caffe on the Green
I dine all throughout the tri state area nothing beats caffe on the green
The food service is outstanding the decor is breath taking
They have a great piano bar as well
I bring people from out of town there they are always amazed how wonderful it is
I've been to many restaurants in the Tri-State Area, but I must say, Caffe on the Green is my favorite
The food is exceptional, the service excellent, and the ambiance exquisite
It is a must go to restaurant, don't miss the experience
This place is incredibly slow
So if you decide to eat hear make sure you have at least 3 hours to devote to dinner
Not only is seating totally empty its slow, even during prime dinner ours at 7
The music is a mix of house radio as well as live band at the same time
So its just all noise
Then the service is slow, and the wait time between ordering and eating is about 30 minutes per item
So if u get appetizers, wait 30 minutes for it to come, then after your done wait another 30 minutes for your entree
By the time your food comes you'll have taken a nap
This place is terrible dont go
Although the food what adequate, the service was preposterous
In response to their excuse that their food is made to order, I ask in return, Who doesn't? The manager had quite an attitude
I recommend that you think twice before dining at this resturant
There are plenty of restaurants to choose from on Bell Blvd
in Bayside but Bourbon Street is my favorite! It has a really nice, relaxed atmosphere
The cajun food is great but there is something for everyone on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed
My favorite is the cafe shrimp
There is always a fun and friendly crowd at the bar, mostly locals, if you just want to come by for happy hour
The staff are super friendly
I highly recommend this restaurant!
This place seems like a great local restaurant
Very lively, great food, big portions
The menu has something for everyone, not just cajun dishes
Check the specials, they always have something really good and different
Also has a really fun bar crowd almost every night of the week
Been in there during the week and very surprised how many people must have off the next day
Definitely give this place a try
Bourbon Street is one of those neighborhood places that the locals flock to
The food is very tasty and the flame broiled burgers have best taste and value I have found
They have a great brunch on weekends and a little known secret is that you can have brunch at the bar for less than $7 (without liquor) that is the same served at tables for $12
95 and up
Big plus is that they accept Rewards Dining Club for 20% off the entire bill including tip!
This is a truly great bang for the buck! Fantastic food; great dinner specials
Lobster bisque is a 10+ and Steaks ; fish and cajun shrimp app are standouts!
Cheap
fast
and the best chicken and broccoli I have had
Want some good reliable chinese food--give Jade Sea a try
My husband I have been going to this place for about 5 years now, and we are always pleased with service and the food
The sushi here is huge, I have to cut it in half because it's so big
I've been to other sushi places and they are not always fresh, Okinawa is consistently fresh, all the time
When we take our friends here, they are always amazed with the freshness and portions
We really love this place and the waitresses are always nice
We took my pops here for Father's Day last night
While the food was good, service tried way too hard
They didnt know the difference between being observant (good service) vs
overbearing
The crabcakes were great, the shrimp cocktail was NOT NOT worth
Now to the steaks
we had the poterhouse and the ny strip
The NY Strip was charrred but still tasty if you scrapped the charred top off
The porterhouse was tender
Dessert was way too sweet and the creamed spinach was very good but not as creamy as other steakhouses
We had a good experience overall but the bill was expensive considering the restaurant was in Queens and the steak was charred
I went to uncle jack's recently and it was one of the best dining experiences i've ever had
The waiter was very friendly and helpful, he was one of my favorite parts of the evening
The steaks were delicious along with the creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes
The shrimp cocktail is huge and the tiramisu cake is wonderful
i had dinner in uncle jack's steakhouse with my friends
it was ladys day out
we choosed to go there because this steakhouse was famous and we wanted to have nice dinner for the holiday
however i think ambience was really not good because it was so noisy loud really bad to have conversation with my friends
also most of people were men, me and my friends felt little uncomfortable being surrounding men
but they really had excellent sevice food was little bit expensive
if any one want to have nice dinner with converstion i think you have think about going to uncle jack's steakhouse
After our waiter described the kobe beef i had to give it a try despite the $100 price tag
And it was the most amazing meat I have eaten
I won't even call it steak because it didn't even taste/feel like steak
It was something entirely different
I can only say that the steak really melted in my mouth while i had to chew the usda prime filet
The regular filet strip were great too, but nothing compared to the kobe beef
The jumbo shrimp cocktail was also delicious despite the hefty cost of $5 per enormous piece
It was a bit noisy and crowded on Thursday night at the restaurant in Bayside, but is definitely worth a try
NYC restaurant card offers a 10% discount
Enjoy!
I JUST HAD DINNER AT THE NEW UNCLE JACKS ON 9TH AVE 34ST
IT WAS AMAZZING!!THE BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD,AND THE LOBSTER TAIL WAS HUGE!!THE DECOR IS BEAUTIFUL,THE ATMOSPHERE WAS FANTASTIC
THE SERVICE WAS LIKE a 6 STAR HOTEL! I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS!
I have been going to Uncle Jacks for years now and I have tried many other steak houses
I keep going back to uncle jacks because the steak is simply the best in new york
The way the steak tastes is like no other steak house steak
Do yourself a favor and go get a medium rare ny strip with a side of garlic mashed and an ice cold bass ale
Overpriced and after looking at the reviews overated
Not bad food, I just don't get all the hype
If you want much better go to Dylan Prime or Morton's

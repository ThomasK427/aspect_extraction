In fact I have never had a pulled-pork sandwich that was better and I have traveled to many places down south
The Crabcakes are also awesome as are the chipotle french fries
You cant beat the prices either
Its a great place to go for a cheap yet good quality meal
I hope they stay in business for a while
My girlfriend and I get Bonnie's burger cravings and we have never been disappointed by Bonnie's food or service
The ambience is low key and relaxed, the service friendly, professional and fun
All the cooking is done before your eyes and the place is immaculate
We love it!
The best burger in the city by far, better than Old Homestead, DB Bisrto and rare
One of a kind burger that can not be found anywhere else but Bonnies in BKLYN
That's what's really good at Bonnie's
I honestly have never tried anything else besides the fries with chipolte mayo, which is delicious as well
Bonnie's wings are real-deal style Buffalo wings - incredibly thick and delicious
The sauce is incredible
Hands down the best chicken wings I've had in NYC
Bonnie's is 100% responsible for getting me addicted to chipotle mayonnaise on french fries
Plus, they're really good fries! The pulled pork BBQ is excellent, as well as pretty much everything on the menu, especially the wings, like others have mentioned
It's a great place to get american food without having to go to a run-of-the-mill diner
:)
This place rocks! One of the slopes great places to eat, whether dining in or taking out
The cheesburgers and the buffalo wings are rockin!
Bonnies does certainly have one of the best burgers you may find in Brooklyn
The Chipatole used for the fries are a nice change and the wings are quite good
The beer selection is above average and they change the art on the walls from different artists making it always something different to see
ooooh the fries, wings, burgers !!! It's all good there!
And this is one of the best burgers I've ever had
The wings are also delicious
Mostly, I love that the food is so excellent, but the feel of the place is still friendly and casual without being a loud sports bar
It is a great addition to the neighborhood
Go here all the time for great burgers wings
Quick effecient service we are usally in out within 45 minutes
Chicken wing, chicken wing, oh how I love thy chicken wing
You fry it in your batter and roll it up in spices, big chunky blue cheese makes them taste so nice's
French fries with chipolte mayo perfectly cooked, god damn that hamburger tasted almost as good as it looked
Jalepeno slices and a little bit of cheese, yes again them hamburgers make me weak in my knees
Anywhere I go I know I never have it better, Bonnie's Grill's food helps me fill my winter sweater
This food is no joke! I challenge any of you to find a better chicken wing!
With its gourmet baked goods and cosy neighborhood charm Two Little Red Hens makes for one of the best places for dessert in Brooklyn
Any of their desserts are the perfect finish to a picnic lunch in the park or a Romantic Dinner at home
Their Brooklyn Blackout Cake is a chocolate lovers dream and the Key Lime Tart is crisp and refreshing
And though these rich, high quality confections dont come cheap, they are worth it
Treat yourself!
Tasty bagels, a good mix of fluffy and chewy texture with excellent flavor
The line is long, but the staff keeps it moving and usually everyone is friendly
They have an eat-in cafe next door, but if the weather's good you can walk over to the park and eat your bagel on a bench for a perfect morning
Terrace Bagels is awesome! Bagels are fresh, perfect consistency and delicious
Often crowded, but the line moves fast
Friendly counter people (some of whom have been there for years)
best bagels -- maybe in nyc
all the trimmings: lox, chopped liver, whitefish salad
plus a whole Italian deli sandwich sides angle
great staff keeps the ridiculous lines moving
I used to go to Terrace Bagels every single morning, but when I got a new apartment the best I could do was once a weekend, but it's always something I look forward to
I would get the raisin bagels and occasionally a plain with lox and cream cheese, but now I go straight for the lox since I don't get there often
Their bagels have the perfect softness to them, but on the outside there's a bit of crispiness to give it a bit of texture
Going early in the morning when they're still fresh is the best
One time I was there and asked for a bagel toasted (big mistake for newbies)
The waitress came back to tell me the bagels just came out of the oven so she wanted me to know if I still wanted it toasted
The Best Bagel in Bklyn and maybe the world
The bagels, sandwiches and baked goods are unbelievably good
The lines get really long, but its really well priced
Someone complained there was no toaster, and not much lox
They missed the point
Target sells toasters
You can go to a fish store
Unfortunately, in New York City, there are very few places for the bagels we grew up with 50 or more years ago
And this is one of them
Treasure it
These bagels are not inflated inner tubes (take that, HH) with no flavor or bad flavor
They are not soft rolls with a hole in them
They are BAGELS, the way G-d made them, right after Adam and the rest of the animals
Go there now
Toast it yourself, if you must toast it
The Bagel Hole in Park Slope has a reputation for very good bagels
Unfortunately, on my visit, they did not live up to their reputation in the service department
The person who waited on me was very rude
In addition, they lack basic ammenities like a toaster, and the decor was shabby, at best
I'd recommend skipping this one
Yes, the bagels taste -- pretty good
And for that we should be grateful
But let's not forget the fairly inept staff and their constant lack of supplies (no lox on a Saturday morning happens regularly)
This bakery is a hidden gem, much to the pleasure of Park Slopers
All varieties of rustic bread are expertly done with impressive results
Definitely up there with Sullivan St
and Le Pain Quotidien (and much cheaper!) The breakfast baked goods are quite delicious too, especially the brioches and the apple turnovers
Red Hot is definitely among the best chinese places in Park Slope
I love their large veggie selection, reasonable prices and the fact they will cook dishes as you would like them - changing ingredients and so forth
I almost always get take out and have always found the girls at the counter to be very friendly
Sometimes it gets very busy though and they are rushed
I probably get food from here more often than any other place in the neighborhood
Their takeout is really really fast and doesn't lose the eat in quality
I rang up for a delivery order tonight and this is as far as i got
After spelling out my street which is only 5 blocks away from the restaurant i was told i was 2 far for delivery, i informed the lady that it is only 5 blocks away she then put me on hold, i was taken off hold by 2 other people before finally getting back to the original lady i spoke to, who then informed me that yes my street was 2 far away, i once again reminded her how close i was to which she responded with, we to busy *click* its always refreshing to become acquainted with a new low in customer service
I hope the food is very good but there are way 2 many good Asian restaurants in Park Slope 2 ever waste another call on Red Hot
This place has the best veggie foods
Their Vegetable Tso's Chicken (100 Vegitarian) tastes better than chicken
Tasty vegetarian fare
Great for take-out, we like their environmentally conscience attitude in regards to condiments and extras
Definitely the best chinese food in Park Slope

I couldnt tell which ones were red or white
They serve parmesan cheese crumbles with your bread, which by the way is heaven (its warm, seasoned and dipped in olive oil)
The staff is attentive and polite
The Veal Francese is very good (although its never enough- the portions should be larger)
As is their grilled whole branzino (a special) -this was theBEST fish dish I've ever had
they have an excellent array of desserts - liked the mixed berries with homemade whipped cream (infused with champage)- very unusual and very good
The restaurant was very small, only 10 tables - but I liked it coz its was a very romantic
I've been coming to Firenze 4-5 times a year since '00 and I live nowhere near the UES, which should say something about the experience
A tiny sliver of a restaurant but the owner's decorating skill consistently improves it, and this speaks nothing of the impeccable service and consistent food
Order three courses and a decent bottle of wine and be amazed at how you'll truly be treated like family
Food was very reasonable - staff was very professional
The veal rivaled the veal I've had in Milan
This is a great place if you're in the neighborhood
I stopped by Sesumi on a Friday night and was surprised that the place was empty
I ordered a few rolls (tuna, salmon/avocado)
I should say that this was probably the first time when I did not finish my sushi
My tuna was tasteless, rubber-like and not particularly fresh
You may run into this kind of quality in a Chinese-run joint but this one is Japanese-owned
I was happy with the service though
Try Gajyumaru or Ota-ya instead
great place for any occasion
its romantic, a nice get together place, and flat out great food
sushi is always fresh and the prepared food is of elegance
Probably one of the best sushi and Japanese cuisine restaurants in the city
The sushi is always fresh and the entrees are made with care
The service is friendly
Good family restaurant during the day and would make a quality romantic setting for couples
The food is so good, the slightest appetizers will make your mouth water for more
I went with two other people and combining the appetizers, entrees and desserts our bill came out to $118
This was not bad considering we were satisfied and willing to eat more
It's THAT good!
The other night, I grabbed a burger at Martell's
Burger was decently good
Service was appalling
Don't waste your time there
I came here for brunch with friends b/c we wanted to eat outside
big mistake
After our waiter finally took our order he came back 20 minutes later to tell us they ran out of cream cheese
We re-ordered and the food still never came
They told us our meal was on the house but when we got up to leave they chased us out yelling
Extremely rude and we will never go back
ps
the french toast was horrible!
We wanted to watch the 2004 World Series without a predominantly Bosox fan base
Luckily, we were recommended to come to Martell's
A nicely decored restaurant on the corner of 2nd and 83rd
However, we were a party of four seated right next to the large screen television so my perspective was poor
Food is primarily of Italian fare served in large portions
Good for a family affair
Don't attempt to go here on a Sunday for brunch
The waitress took our order and then never came back again
When we asked the hostess what happened were told the food was never picked up - OH REALLY??!! Duh, thanks
Then we were told that the waitress was in the kitchen arguing with them
Bottom line
no food
Also the people sitting next to them never had their dirty plates picked up for at least 20 minutes, after the watiress served the food she never came back
Needless to stay we didn't stay around to find out when she did
The Monday and Thursday evenings are great for good service and a knowledgeable bartender
Even in an off night this place was fun with friendly UES natives and visitors
PQ was friendly, introduced me to a new drink, and helped me pick a good spot to take a second date
The bathrooms were so-so but the music selection was good and kept the ambience juiced
It is an unusually friendly spot on the UES and I plan on going back often
Decent pub on the upper east
music selection was mostly 80's stuff for a Sat Nite
not my style
Was there with a big group, if I wasn't there with a large group of friends, I would have left after a drink or two
Pints of Bass were 5
50 and the mixed drinks were done well
Great wedding music, my mom had the best time
There was so much smoke coming from the DJ booth so I couldn't request Footloose, my favorite!!!!
If you're a sophomoric wannabe yuppie, this is the place for you
Bad food
Bad service
Bad attitude
Pretentious clientele
The Scene The tiny, wood-wrapped dining room is entirely candle-lit and filled with rustic farmhouse artifacts
Attentive, suited gentlemen (most members of the family that has owned Erminia for 20 years) whisper to the starry-eyed, gussied-up couples seated at ten linen-draped tables
Wine glasses are clunky, old wood chairs rattle a bit, but the mood is no less formal
The Food Erminia goes for the gusto with upscale, old-fashioned Italian classics--many satisfying, all exceedingly expensive
Don't miss milky homemade mozzarella, tender-hearted deep fried artichokes and paper-thin carpaccio with excellent olive oil
Homemade pastas, like creamy sausage-mushroom pappardelle and hearty overstuffed manicotti napped with fresh tomato sauce, are highlights
Fish entrees aren't: Gigantic zuppa di pesce is muddy-tasting with fishy salmon and chewy calamari, and beautifully cooked snapper's rich onion sauce masks its flavor
Meat dishes, like tender veal rollotini with sweet sultana-savory herb stuffing, are better bets
The only thing keeping the ratings on this restaurant so high are the probably the loyal customers who haven't bothered to go anywhere else for ITALIAN
With so much competition in NYC, especially SPIGOLO so close by in proximity, ERMINIA falls short of a great ITALIAN experience, with your wallet leaving the most disappointed
While the space is undeniably cozy, and the small atmosphere gives it a very homey old world feel, unfortunately the food is just average at best, and not what you expect given the high prices
This very romantic Italian restaurant is the greatest!! The food is very authentic and tasty
The staff were very warm and gracious
I would stop in if you desire a fabulous meal at a resonable price
Erminia's is the best kept secret in Manhatten and Nick and his staff do an excellent job with all the amentities
We have been going to Erminia's for over 10 years and actually were engaged there and it gets better and better each time
Small, cozy and quaint atmosphere with excellent food and superb wine list
Our favorite place in Manhattan
Unbelievably romantic
Don't wait for a special occasion
Nick is the best
Food Wine are incrediable
NO CELL PHONES PLEASE! You have to try this one you won't be dissapointed
This place is fantastic!! I went with my husband for my birthday and it was top notch
The food is delicious and the service and atmosphere was wonderful

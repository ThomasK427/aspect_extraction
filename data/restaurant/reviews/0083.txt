wow!
The Scene Less trendy than Plan Eat Thailand, less crowded than Veracruz and infinitely more charming is Bean, a Mexican spot on Bedford Avenue's college-town-like stretch
Festively-painted and closet-sized, the restaurant is brightened with the most stunning array of kitschy light fixtures this side of the Williamsburg Bridge
It's the sort of restaurant where, instead of telling you to enjoy your meal, the waitress says "have a good time
"  The Food The Mexican menu covers the staples--burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas--along with less traditional dishes, such as grilled salmon and peach cobbler
Particularly good is the chicken verde burrito with a refreshingly spicy salsa that avoids the heat overkill
Steamed mussels are another winner, with plenty of bread for sopping up the peppery broth
Fortunately, unlike many Mexican joints, the abundance of cheese never tastes greasy, and portions are filling but not overwhelming
after living in LA for 3 years, my standards for mexican food had skyrocketed
my prayers were answered when a friend took me to bean
literally a hole in the wall with a hole in the wall
bean has the best fish tacos hands down and pretty spectacular nachos -chips and salsa are complimentary
it's byob (and might as well be glass too, but this adds to bean's charm) which makes it just the more affordable
The fish tacos are outstanding!!! Get them, seriously
cute atmosphere, very dark, dark, dark
Almost feels like the goth-girl in high school turned her bedroom into an closet restaurant
The music was also very odd, nothing like eating mexican fare while listening to Marilyn Manson's cover of sweet dreams
The major problem I had was paying four dollars for chips and salsa, when just about every other mexican joint on the planet gives them for free
Waitress was unenthusiastic and refilled my water only after I asked her to but did not refill my date's empty water glass?!?!? Whatever, it showed in the tip
It's mexican with something extra
I had such a good experience at Bean - the menu is unexpected but in a good way, and the food is so delish!!! Try the corn chowder!!!
I always want to die after eating at bean because I'm so full
The food tends to be extremely heavy on the stomach but its good, solid, and straightforward mexican with a few garnishes
The cobbler is worth a try as is the blueberry lemonade
Bring your own hooch
Yummy Mexican food! I love their guacamole and chips
Their quesidillas rule
Their grilled shrimp salad is my favorite! Emilano salad is my boyfriend's favorite
Yummy homemade cobbler
Yum
Except for the burrito and enchilada dishes with mole, the food is only okay
I have not been in the restaurant for a while, but used to order for delivery until today
There is always some problem, from getting the order wrong to overcharging to rude and indifferent telephone service
Delivery can also take an hour or longer
The food was only okay, but it arrived lukewarm
The best thing about this place was the blueberry lemonade, which you can also get at Union Picnic just a short stroll away with way better food
An unimpressive take on mexican food
In one wordbland
Beautiful interiors are the extent of this restaurant's charm
i have always been pleased with my dinners here! the chips and salsa are great and the entrees are fresh and generous in size
and the prices are totally fair
it's a byob, so you can save a few bucks by bringing your own cerveza, too
definitely try this place
but don't bring a big party-- it's a small size
I love Bean! It's the best place to eat if you are really in the mood for mexican food
Much better than Vera Cruz!!!! Try the mole sauce on everything
It's that good
The atmosphere at Bean is very cozy and the food is decent
The nachos are piled high and very filling as a main entree, and vegetarian friendly if you wish
The mole sauce is delicious here! The chicken breast with mole sauce, guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo is a delicious main course and quite filling
The mole sauce is not too sweet and adds a nice flavor to the otherwise bland chicken
The enchiladas are just like enchiladas anywhere else though
Food was ok, appetizers were expensive compared to the cheap main dishes
Service was nice
Everything about this place is great
I have never once had a bad meal here
The fish is the freshest i have tasted
The Rolls are huge and creative
The service is always friendly and prompt
I always say i am going to try somthing new on their menu but what i usually get is so great that I can't bear to order anything else
(The Spider Roll is the best i have ever had) This place is a must try for every New Yorker
As the first sushi restaurant in Williamsburg this small restaurant stands strong against all the big neighboring restaurants
Sushi is very fresh
Unlike other restaurants where the foods are prepared even before customers order, Miyako customers are guaranteed fresh, quality food
Their food is worth coming back for
I have come to Miyako for 6 years and always walk out full and happy!
I urge you to try their Hwai Dup Bop
Though pricely at $18, you'll get all kinds of fish topped on seasoned rice and fresh vegetable
Not only you'll be satisfied, your date will be impressed by your choice
Although this isn't comparable to sushi in Japan, where they'd fillet the fresh live fish straight out of a fish tank, and which you don't easily find in the US, they are truely authentic
I've been to Japan before and tried some of the most high end and homey food
Miyako offers close to a lot of these experiences except the shoes taking off part
Staffs are friendly and courageous
They offer a just right length of menu, including non-sushi japanese and Korean items
Once you start going to Miyako, you'll see familiar customers all the time
You will be happy everytime you walk in here, smelling their home-made sesame oil
After stumbling into this tiny restaurant in Williamsburg one cold night, I was pleasantly surprised at what it had to offer: The Sashimi was fresh, the Wasabi was nice and hot and the portions were large
Their Korean menu was also equally impressive, A must try is the Kimchee cabbage pancakes as an appetiser ( the portions were as big as an entree!) , the Korean Mandoo dumpling and rice cake soup, the Sashimi dinner and the Korean Bulgogee ( Kimchee was great too!)
I have yet to try the acclaimed Williamsburg roll , and there's no doubt that I will be visiting this restaurant again to try out their extensive sushi roll menu
It's even better than GO! restaurant on St Marks which is on my top 5 sushi joints in NY
Oh yeah, and the service was fast and friendly too
The Scene For those of us who define "coffee shop" as a place to relax with reading material and a frothy latte, modern New York can be disappointing
Lucky Gramercy Park residents, though, have 71, the area's equivalent of Cheers
It's the New York you thought was long gone; orders are spoken, not yelled, and the staff knows the names of patrons' dogs
In nice weather, the outside benches are crowded with locals sipping iced coffee
The Food In addition to its potent, expertly made coffee drinks--beans come from upstate coffee roaster Irving Farm--71 stocks a full array of cakes, tarts, sandwiches and salads
Mornings bring crowds for great waffles, oatmeal and muffins; evenings pull a clientele eager for wine and cheese plates, Ciao Bella sundaes and banana splits
On sunny days, get your order to go for an impromptu picnic in the park--Union Square, that is, if you're without a Gramercy key
Four of us went to 71 in late December and really liked it
The interior was charming and very much a real coffeehouse (and they don't mind if you linger), the desserts were sinfully-delicious and the coffee was very good, the staff were exceptionally friendly personable
what's not to like?
For all those who hate Starbucks
this is your place
What a real coffee spot should be
the coffee is great
service is quick
the only tough thing is waiting in line, because you have to stand next to their muffin and cake windows (they are so smart)
my wife loves to go there and read or write
I love 71 I go there every night of the week I can't live without my cup of 71 house coffee
The store has a great atmosphere amd amazing staff who are always there to help if its a cup of coffee or a nice chat

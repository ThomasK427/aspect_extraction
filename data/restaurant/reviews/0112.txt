I dare you to find a better deal in Manhattan for this quality
I brought a friend to TTR for his birthday
The venue is cramped, but the small tasting dishes are certainly an appropriate fit on the small tables
The cuisine itself is delicious and creative
Unfortunately, these positives were overshadowed by the poor service
The server was increasingly curt and rude throughout the dinner
Due to the poor service, I tipped the server ten percent instead of my usual twenty percent
Later that night, the restaurant called me, asking why I tipped the server only ten percent
I explained the situation
Her response was that since the server hasn't had a complaint for three years, then I am no longer welcome at The Tasting Room and hung up the phone on me
There are better restaurants in NYC
This had to one of my best dinning experiences ever
I felt as if I was a guest in someones home
Not only was the food absolutely delicious and perfect but the wait staff complimented it perfectly
To eat such fine cuisine in a relaxed non formal atmosphere is wonderful
You must make a reservation so you don't miss out
The small dining space add to it's uniqueness
It may be a bit pricey, but it is worth it
It's just everything
the food, the atmosphere
the incrediby kind and gracious hostess
I just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it's not a cheap night out
but it's SO worth it
A friend of mine took me for a birthday dinner here and it was
quite amazing
It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even
The food, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next
We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess, it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well
All in all, I don't see how you can go wrong
I've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I've never been disappointed
The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to
Granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants
Less = More in their case
I enjoy the collaboration of chef's with Owner / Chef Colin Alevras from time to time but truly love it best when Colin is in full swing
Very excited to hear that short-term Chef Jason Narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record
Recently had dinner and what a great experience
First of all, all American wine list very well thought out
Next, the food was inventive and delicious
The tasting portions are fairly generous
Finally, the service was friendly, accomodating and knowledgeable
amazing wine list
loved it loved it loved it
the waiter knew the list very well, and had many interesting (and good) suggestions to go with tasty appetizers
small, yes, but very cozy
I've heard so many good things about this place in the press, but never from anyone I know
I finally made it
I heard it was small, but the restaurant is smaller than the smallest studio apartment that I've been in
The food is creative, but is hit or miss
It's good if you're just going for a casual dinner and want to try new things
If you want anything special or out of the ordinary--SKIP THIS PLACE
I had heard how good the food was and how the service was exceptional
The service was so minimal
There are so many other places to eat at in NYC that you should skip this one unless you live close by
They don't take American Express
Been there; eaten there
Afterwards, we read the reviews and we think that this place has improved by leaps and bounds over time from the 08/02 bashing
Food was unbelievable, service was OK (just plain OK) and the wine list is extensive (but, why so many Americans for such a French menu??)
The fact that they have few tables is an incentive, although some may feel crowded
What a great place
One of our favorites in NYC now
The Tasting Room is one of the best restaurants in New York
If you are into food as I am, then you will have a wonderful experience here
All dishes are prepared meticulously and the focus is on food as an experience
Be prepared to explore interesting taste and texture combinations as always accompanied by a huge selection of domestic wines that rival any from Europe
The space is somewhat cramped, but you learn to deal with it as the food is so good
This place is for serious foodies who seriously enjoy food
The food is really unusual
Very creative, flavors mixed unexpectedly, subtle tastes
Service is excellent
However the place is so noisy and cramped that I couldn't hear my partner speaking
The mouth of the couple next table was literally 1 ft from my ear and it overwhelmed all our conversation
When we wanted to get out to go to the restroom, 4 other people had to stand up to let us out
The noise ridiculously cramped space spoiled our enjoyment of an otherwise good meal
And oh, it is VERY expensive
if you appreciate a variety of delicious flavors than the small portions shouldn't bother you-- you are forewarned they're tasting sizes, order another! the foie gras is ridiculously good; the service is knowledgable and attentive, but not overbearing; and the wine list, which features all american wines, is refreshingly unique and very lengthy
it took me a minute to get used to the cramped seating, but that's what's kind of fun about this east village treasure where you can actually hear the person you're dining with (and the guy behind you)
A cramped yet somehow inviting space sets the stage for delicate portions of unique and exciting food
For a table of 4, the combinations of foie gras and strawberry compote, melon soup with foie gras mousse, etc
inspire conversations about other foods and taste - an interesting experience I'd definitely recommend
This is not for those expecting a #1 Combo, Super-Sized McD's meal
Portions aren't large, but that is part of the concept
Hence the word Tasting in the restaurant's name
It is unlike any other restaurant in the city
Varied menu
Interesting flavor combinations
Superb wine list
Friendly, warm service
Cozy environment
Not pricey for those who want fresh food that will make you think and appreciate your taste buds
Amateurs need not apply!
The Tasting Room is for seasoned foodies who want something new
Of the eight taste we shared, one was great, six were very good/good, and one disappointed
However, all were unique, experimental food so we knew the odds going in and weren't disappointed
The owner/sommelier is very knowledgeable about great wines from small American wineries
Great service from a knowledgeable staff accompanied the meal
If you're really into food and eat out a lot, you'll enjoy the fresh approaches and new wines
If not, you may find it a bit too unusual and a bit to expensive (over $200 inc
wine tip)
Also, at times the chef's creativity seems to exceed his technical ability--resulting in great concepts being mis-executed (e

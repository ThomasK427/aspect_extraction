The place was busy, but the comfortable banquets and friendly service made me not mind waiting a little extra while for my food to come out
And the food was wonderful
Southern/ Asian/ American fusion sounds bizarre, but everything was creative and delicious
I'll definitely come back!
Always have a great meal at Punch
It's really a bargain for what you get
But! I just discovered that they have a lounge above the restaurant
The events/ambience vary from night to night
We went on a thursday and they played some funky/cool music
I liked the neighborhood vibe
They also have some inventive martinis and a happy hour on weekdays
We shall return
Had an after-work drink at the bar with a date, loved the place so much we came back for brunch the next morning
The food was incredible
My date had a berry foster version of french toast
Wow
Now I remember why people wake up on the weekends
I had the fried chicken with cheddar grits
I don't know what the secret recipe is but it beats Colonel Sanders
And the grits were flavorful and creamy
Can't wait to try the dinner menu
One last thing
Bartenders at this joint make a mean blood mary
I've lived in the flatiron district
The neighborhood's always had heavy hitters like Grammercy Tavern and Fleur De Sel
I've never even noticed Punch
A friend recommended it recently and I had the best meal I've had in awhile
The food is a spin on classic/southern American
Creative, fresh and fun
I loved the Barbecued Snapper
My boyfriend got the foie gras and an order of the fried oysters
I feel like a fat house
I couldn't stop eating
I saw the chef visiting some tables on the dining room floor
He's a tall drink of water
Food, service, ambience, not one complaint to peep about
Heard a thing or two about the new chef
who I had never heard of before
anyway, took the trek down to Punch (has a great late night scene) and walked away wondering why
Why the buzz? Why all the cliches on the menu? Why not spend some real cash and get a real chef? Too bad, something special could have come forth, but alas it wasn't to be
I have been eating here for years and, in fact, I met my current wife while dining there
However, recent changes to the menu implemented by their new chef, Sid Talbot, have me looking for a new spot
Tried the espresso rubbed filet and found the preparation to be an affront against an excellent cut of meat
Overall, food has gone from awesome to average
Might give it another shot but I doubt it
I've been going to Punch forever
The food has always been outstanding
Over the last year they've remodeled a bit and brought in new chef, Sam Talbot
I was a little tentative with the changes
However, the effort they put into improving a good thing shows
The food was excellent
Now, it's even better
Try the calamari, Espresso rubbed Filet Mignon, and the banana-berry foster for dessert
The only thing I didn't like was the bread that came to the table before dinner
I didn't think you could have bread that was too crusty
Well, you can
The wine list is varied enough to satisfy everyone
Service was attentive and friendly
*Bonus--hit the lounge upstairs for an after-dinner drink
There are sometimes fun events going on up there
I've been on a Tuesday for their early comedy night and on a Wednesday for the live brazilian jazz band
Despite a relaxing atmosphere and good background music, Punch's upstairs lounge was a disappointment
They were out of 2 of the beers on the menu---on a Friday night, no less
Our waitress seemed confused and inattentive
Tasty appetizers though
French fries, calimari and string beans
I have been going to Punch about once a month for the past 3 years but I don't think I'll go back again
They hired a new chef 2 weeks ago and while the food was not bad, it certainly was not the Punch menu I know and love
The dishes were average at best
My favorite dishes like Pad Thai and Cashew Crusted Halibut were gone as were the yummy ginger candies they gave when you paid the bill
I am open to new menu items but why remove the best ones??
I've eaten here on several occasions and never been dissapointed by the food
If you are not afraid to try dishes with a twist on Asian cusine then Punch does a great job
Cocktails are also good and here you can avoid the crowds
This is one of the unassuming restaurants of the area
The chef does an excellent job of mixing flavors and each dish I've had is delicious
The service is excellent, ambiance is quaint and pleasant, and the brunch is a great choice also! Definitely worth the little extra $$
I have eaten here 10+ times over the last 3 or 4 years and find the food to be consistently good, the service good, and the atmosphere fun (if not a little to loud)
My boyfriend and I ate here for NYE 2003
It was the only place I could get reservations last minute
It had good ratings, so why not? right? This place was probably trendy when it was just born, but this place didn't impress me all that much
The clientele seemed to be trying too hard to be cool
The decor is great and the lounge upstairs was playing good music but
the crowd was sparce and the food was just ok
The mussels were fishy but my boyfriend's sirloin was pretty good
Go for brunch
Small place with Pier One styled decor and attractive (though inattentive) wait staff
Perfect omlettes and amazing asian-inspired meals
Can't speak to dinner or late night, but brunch food is perfect
Unfortunately the bloody mary's are weak, and you will only get one, since the waitress won't be around much
I went to Punch last night with my two girlfriends and we absolutely loved it! We found the cockled fish and salad with melon balls to be particularly tasty
As an apetizer, we ordered the tempura fried ahi rolls
They were served warm and smelled excellent - simply orgasmic
Great experience also due to impressive service and a wonderful ambiance
Perfactadomundo evening!!!
I recently went to Punch with my boyfriend and another couple expecting to enjoy the trendy, fun setting Punch once was
Our reservations were for 9:00 on a saturday night and we were the only table there! Despite the fact that Punch has definitely lost much of it's cool - the menu is diverse, the food tasty, and the service fine
Overall - a decent dining experience
Hint - order the hummus to start
Punch has a very creative menu that changes from time to time but the staple that I would recommend would be the calimari appetizer

you will not be disappointed
I've always felt that NOBU was overpriced, and Nobu 57 is no different, of course
That being said, I don't feel that Nobu is a great value, but the great service and warm sexy setting makes up for much
The decor is a little over-done and contrived, but the lighting is warm and it's intimate
The menu is almost exactly like the downtown menu, with a few new items
Service is extremely attentive and the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and the various ingredients
I went to the tasting before Nobu opened and the menu and service has greatly improved since then
The best part of it all is that everytime I go, I know I will have a good, though pricey experience
Its big, its cavernous and the acoustics leave something to be desired
Went there last week on a Wednesday, the bar bustled and the crowd was a mix from suits to downtown chic
I prefer the downtown outpost of Nobu becasue I think its a tad more quaint and less frenetic
However, the food is great in either place and I think it out shines Ono or Masa--one man's humble opinion
Miso cod is a fav and a classic
Service was attentive yet not intrusive
Some people are never happy unless they're complaining I guess
The negative reviews already posted are way off base
The food is outstanding, the management is gracious and the waitstaff is knowledgable and very accomodating
It's quite the scene, and it's noisy and a bit difficult to talk, but the food and service are most excellent
The yellowfish with jalapeno (both cold dish and sushi), toro tartare and sashimi salad are all wonderful
Black cod with miso was very very good, though not as good as those, imo
All in all, quite excellent
I've gone to this new trendy spot in the heart of the city with a few of my business clients,hoping to have a great meal and service after a month waiting on the reservation list, well the meal was actually not bad, but the management is horrible and arrogant
Very stuck up people and me and my clients was not pleased at all, i would definitely not recommend this place if you want to have a nice place to take your business clients, what an embarassment for me and my company to show my clients what i assumed to be a great spot
Some people are never satisfied
They are looking to be disapointed, disenchanted, disgruntled
If that's you're thing, don't come to the Nobu 57 Bar
If however, you are ready for a ride - unlike any you've ever had - belly up to the onyx/walnut work of art and tell the guys you're hungry
If you can bear it, forego the menu and trust the guys who know best
It can get pricy, so if you're worried about it, give em' something to shoot for
You will be WELL taken care of
The yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno, baby spinach fluke salad, and the Kobe beef (they call it washu) as well as the tempora rock shrimp, oysters wrapped in filo, miso cod, and especially squid pasta are all incredible
Wednedays and thursdays are a bit wild - more of a club(cougers!) and harder to get food
The food sucked! The service was awful
I have been to every other Nobu (LA, Miami, Tribeca, Vegas etc
) and the food is always great (interesting and exotic dishes)
This place is nothing like the others
Big waste of time and money
Nice place but nothing like the original NOBU, the food is decent and so is the decor
Very touristy, I went on a Saturday
Small portions, I would go again but I would not go out of my way to go there, your not missing anything
I went on a Thursday night with friends to have cocktails and food at the bar
The service was horrible
The bartenders were nasty and mean to pretty much everyone
I have never seen anything like it in many years
I am a fan of Nobu downtown and I found the new Nobu at least on a Thursday night at the bar to be a real disappointment
I will not be going back
Big fan of Nobu downtown, Nobu 57's food is just as amazing except, now there is some what of a bar scene
Food is always superb!! Rock shrimp tempura, snapper with the jalapeno peppers and black cod always a favorite
A MUST to try is the peach soup over the beer ice cream - to die for!!!! Could take 3 weeks to get a reservation however, well worth the wait
Waitstaff is always pleasant
As a humble peon, I had to make dinner reservations for a surprise bday dinner for my husband about 3 weeks in advance
But it was definitely worth the wait, b/c the hosts and our server were really courteous, and the food was delicious
The miso cod was just like Ming Tsai's miso butterfish - buttery and succulent
We reverently refrained from speaking while eating the cod simply b/c each bite was truly heavenly
It's not too conducive to romance, so be prepared to overhear, in great detail, loud conversations about day trading, the Bahamas, and hedge funds
the place looks ok, but nothing special at all
the food is also average but at least i know the effort is there to make it from good quality ingredients
I wanted to give this place a fair chance, because I love mexican, but it just was not that spectacular
My friend got a very good black bean soup, but that was the best thing on the table
They overwrapped my burrito so that getting through the tortilla was just way too much effort
It was also just average, spicy, but I had had better
My friend's veggies tacos were also just mediocre
The plus beside the soup was that they did have tofu sour cream and veggie options if you're into that
I did not think it was over priced, but there is better mexican in this hood
Nothing was wrong with the service and the place was huge and empty, but i see why it was empty
I do not think I will return
they charged $5 for chips and salsa, but did not tell us
they brought them out and surprised us when we looked at the bill
the margaritas were ok, but not great
the food was not filling
they put potatoes in the burritos, and they do not belong there
the taste was bland an even the spicy salsa lacked flavor
the only redeeming quality of this place is their staff who were polite and friendly, but their service could not make up for the food
I liked this place because they have really good, interesting burritos AND they aren't afraid of a little Velveta on the nachos
However, the service was really really bad
Not that they weren't trying
There was one waitress and one bartender, and the place is huge
Even though it wasn't totally full, the waitress had to RUN around the restaurant, and the drinks and the food took a LONG time to arrive
I would definitely give it another try, but they need to hire some more people
A great addition to Williamsburg
Very friendly owners and hit the spot mexican food at a reasonable cost
Casual atmosphere
A little astere for my taste but definitely well done
Not a hole in the wall
The tamales were a special so I'm not sure if they always have them but well worth asking for
A couple tacos was a good size meal
They are stuffed with interior style mexican goodies
Great place to bring a big group late at night
Not trendy like Bonita so you don't have to wait
Seems to have a full bar too
Ok
the restaurant is divided into two halves
each with its own decor!!! Pretty interesting to me! And the menu
is a 1/2 1/2 too!! I forget exactly
but I think it's mexican and peruvian
whatever
it was the bomb!!! The chocolate tamales were awesome! The food was good
but the atmosphere was original!! I was with my date and we sat in a 1/2 semicircle booth
very romantic
and it was glowing bluish/green

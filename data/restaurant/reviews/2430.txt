Don't go here!
We had the antipasta appetizer and I had one of the dozens of great-sounding specials that night: smoked mozzerela raviola with shitake mushrooms in a pink sauce
It was all good
The service was also excellent
The only drawback was the lack of reservations for small parties
The lines can get long
great bread, great pasta, great wine, and great staff! I recommend this restaurant, but you'd better make a reservation
I was brought shrimp in my meal though I specifically mentioned I was vegetarian
The serving waiter was rude, the head waiter told me that I should have been clearer
than saying I am vegetarian, please do not add the seafood
I called to speak with a manager
was told by the assistant manager that it was a busy lunch
So I'm supposed to take their attitude and horrible service because it's lunch?
Great pastas with wonderfully fresh sauces
I highly recommend the spaghetti e gamberoni
Small, but romantic in a great area
and most importantly, at a good price
My chicken special with asparagus was just so-so, but my friend's lobster ravioli in a white wine sauce was wonderful
Great service, nice wine list
Walked right in at 8:15 p
m
on a Saturday
Fresh pastas from the entrees were excellent
I liked the vongole appetizer; the staff was friendly
Being the most convenient mexican restaurant to us, we really wanted to like it
Unfortunately, the ambiance, in particular to the back room, is non-existant, feels more like a cafeteria
The food was at best average and uninsipired, felt like the food that one would get at an airport Mexican restaurant, and unfortunately with the high prices to match
My girlfriend an I hadn't been to santa fe in about a year and a half, and were very disappointed upon our return
The service was very lax and the food uninspired and not fresh
The Scallop Ceviche smelled badly of fish, my encrusted sea bass was cold and seemed like it had been sitting around for a while, and the presntation was pretty lame, almost thrown together at the last second
The margaritas are always solid, but that's not a good enough reason to go to Santa Fe
Santa Fe is not only a great neighborhood spot for a drink and a snack, but an interesting restaurant in its own right
Swordfish with BBQ sauce, wonderful guacamole, a mexican version of jambalaya, and even a spicey meatloaf!  Soothing atmosphere, charming service, and very reasonable prices!
then Santa Fe is the place for you and you can forgive it for its rather bland menu - a gastranomical adventure, it is not, but the restaurant does offer very simple, basic tex-mex fare - and that, it does rather well
The ambience is casual-elegant and has its mexican touches but is not overdone
The drinks are good and it definitely has one of the best red sangria's available in new york city!
I recently moved to the Upper West Side and thought that Santa Fe looked like a decent place to dine
Boy was I wrong! My friend and I waited nearly 30 minutes for someone to offer us water and an additional 10 to be offered drinks
Once the waitress did decide to leisurely stroll over to our table, she added insult to injury by being rude
We stuck it out, though and ended up with one of the blandest, most tatseless meals we had had in a long time
On top of that, no one there would speak to the mother at the next table who did not have enough sense to take her screaming brat outside
I will not return anytime soon
I went there on Feb
21, 2005 at around 6:30pm after viewing The Gates in Central Park
Our waitress was unfriendly, owing in part to a lack of command of our common English language, and unfamiliarity with common courtesies practiced in American restaurants
The smallest requests to other service people there, like a busboy, were rebuffed with non-English mumblings
And get this: while my date got her salad OK, my burger NEVER ARRIVED
Can you believe this, folks? We ordered a salad and a burger, and my burger never arrived
Meanwhile, tables all around are served their food, though apparently not without difficulty
When the waitress brought the check after an hour, she finally noticed that I had been sitting without food and offered to get it for me
I politely declined
You might consider eating elsewhere if you actually want to eat when you're at a restaurant
Unfortunately, the waiter, bus boy as well as the cashier were rude and unkind
It's amazing the staff can get away with such a poor attitude towards their work
The food was just average
Would never recommend this restaurant
This place should close immediately, it's a disgrace to the name of Hunan and people of China
Food was just awful
Won't ever go back
have been a regular for the last few years, but noticed things had been slipping over the last few orders
Although concerned, I decided to give them one more chance
For that, we were rewarded with what was by far the most vile chinese either of us have ever experienced
It smelled bad and tasted worse -- like something leftover from new years
For that lovely experience, we were refused a refund and, instead, rewarded with a credit to apply against our next order
If you would like it, its all yours
We order from here quite frequently
I can't speak for the ambience, since I've never eaten in house; however, I can say the the food is fabulous for chinese food
We recommend the chicken with peanuts
The ingredients always seem so fresh and flavorful
The delivery man is there before you can bat an eye
Bang for the buck, this place is tops
For your typical Chinese dinner, this place serves great food fast -- but without rushing you
All ingredients are fresh and the dumplings are outstanding!
There is a reason many New York celebrities dine here
The Food! You'll dine under several pictures of the owner and well-known faces and they come here because they can and HAVE tried everywhere else
The decor leaves something to be desired, but that is not why you go here
The excellent service, DELICIOUS food, and comfortable atmosphere has made this place almost a weekly stop on my dining ventures
Try it, you won't be disappointed!
Cafe La Fortuna is slow, easy, inexpensive, friendly
it's like going into your old Italian Uncle's kitchen
(in fact the guy who runs it is called Uncle Vinny!!!) Fun Photos on the wall and outdoor garden in the back make it a great getaway
John and Yoko hung out here for hours
even shot an album cover there
Food is light fare, pastries are plentiful (with the best Italian Cheesecake in the City), espresso and wine bars, Italian ice in the summertime
Plus, it serves the full menu to Midnight 7 days a week, open even later on Friday and Saturday
The best food I ever had in my life ,after entering in the resturant I was been wellcome with smile and been given nice table
I order chicken sag and lamb chop
wow I never had flavorful food like this in my life
The sizzling , testy food friendly service remind me to go back to mughlai
The food is pretty decent here, but the servers are so incredibly rude that it just makes you not want to go back
They look at you as if they want you to die for coming into their restaurant
Ordered a chicken saag dish once that had 3 measley chunks of chicken drowning in about 3 cups of spinach sauce
I am an Indian Food lover and have tried so many places! Mughlai was surprisingly good and flavorful
It is a great place to go out in the neighborhood for Indian food
It is a bit pricey, but it is worth it
They will also make special things that are not on the menu if you request it
Has a good brunch as well (much better than going to a buffet
)
I heard that Mughlai is a Columbus Ave
tradition! I live on Columbus Avenue, but had never been

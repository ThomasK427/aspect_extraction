The congee here is the best of all Chinatown
It's a place of cold remedies for me
Good quality congee takes lots of effort and time, and this restaurant definitely makes the effort
The service is pleasant
It's the first place in mind when I'm willing to walk a few blocks out of the way for brunch
Theme-like and esoteric, the restaurant takes the traditional Cantonese foodfare like rice porridge (congee), chow fun, and noodle dishes and charge it with a little pizzazz
The baked rice are stuffed into bamboo containers, the seafood nest dish is served in a pineapple halfshell, and the traditional porridge are served in two neat versions: cooked in a traditional clay pot or a la fondue-esque
Yum! Meanwhile, the whole scene takes place in a Vegas-like village atmosphere
I ate until I literally felt as though I would explode
This place is a little slice of heaven, gutton heaven
For $20 a head me and a bunch my chums ate like homless men with a found Visa card
I could have taken on the Kombiashi the Nathan's hot dog champ with the amount of delicious sweat and sour pork I put down
I may never be the same again, but I love the dirty place for it
Respect the village

The congee is absolutely excellent
Much of the rest of the menu, particularly the standard Hong Kong dim sum items, are lackluster at best, but you come here for the congee
Particulary recommended is the preserved egg and pork - the salt and fat combine nicely with the more simple, homey flavor of the congee itself
The service has nothing to recommend it, but you don't really come here for the service
The Scene With its large fish tanks in the front windows, pleasant dining room and obliging service, Fuleen promises a satisfying Chinatown experience
There are usually a half-dozen or so daily specials, though getting waiters to divulge them may take some prodding
The Food While you'll find respectable renditions of Chinese favorites like a peppery orange beef, succulent stewed pork ribs with black bean sauce and sundry steamed and fried fish, the attraction here is a wide array of wonderful crustacean specialties
Start with a bamboo steamer filled with pinky-sized deep-fried red shrimp, so sweet and fresh that you want to pop them down shells-and-all
Also exceptional are golden strips of deep-fried striped bass and giant Dungeness crabs that are steamed with seaweed then smeared with a paste of hot peppers and garlic
Wok-seared Chinese beans are a fine accompaniment
We have returned to this restaurant several times for the excellent seafood and have never been dissapointed
Typical Chinatown restaurant
Nothing special
Clean place, average service, extensive menu
They screwed up the sequence of the meal for my party
Best to share dishes
Drop by Good World for a drink afterwards
Good authentic value in Chinatown
Know for its fish, many of the dishes are shown full color on the menu, so experimenting can be tempting
A Huge serving for lunch was under $5
Tablecloths, very attentive and friendly service
4 of us ate for $45 this included 1 appetizer, 4 beer, 2 wines and our 4 meals
Great value
The squid was a bit chewy but tasty
The Chilie Shrimp was very good but could use a vegetable dish on the side
Garlic sauce a little sweet but over all very pleasant and a value
Having grown up in the San Francisco Bay Area and raised on Hong Kong style dim sum, I was hoping that at least one of numerous Chinese restaurants in Manhattan could be counted on for a similar experience
I've sampled several other dim sum places here, and none feature the winning combination that Triple 8 offers: reasonable prices, large range of standard _and_ less common dim sum, little/no wait (not like the Mott St
restaurants), not-too-greasy cooking (not like Shun Lee), consistent quality (not like Jin Fong), family atmosphere (not like Golden Unicorn), and helpful service (e
g
, they'll run to the kitchen to fetch what you want if you don't see it on the carts)
The Hong Kong-style (carts with the foods are pushed around and you decide what you want to take) dim sum was amazing! We were seated right away, even on a busy Sunday afternoon, and our first plate was placed on the table in minutes
The restaurant (located upstairs in the mall) is very large, but the flow of food was constant
When I hadn't seen any of their delicious baked pork buns, one of the waitstaff happily sought out a cart that had some and brought a plate to our table
This is a great place for both large and small dim sum outings!!
The waitress had no manners
They push you to buy appettizers that you don't want
Horrible experience
I totally think they sell you cat for chicken
I've been a customer for some twenty years
This place has become like an old friend
You know what to expect and they don't let you down
The food is fresh, tasty and well prepared
The restaurant is clean and comfortable
I have often been able to obtain special dishes not on the menu
The owner and some staff are wonderful
But I must admit some of the staff are clueless, thankfully not many
Of course I always ask for the same waiter
You can't go wrong downtown if you are looking for solid Chinese
I eat at China Chalet about once a month and always enjoy myself
Both locations are good - Broadway Pearl St
It's not gourmet Chinese, but they do have a large menu and the food is tasty, the portions generous, and the prices fair for the locale
The decor is nice and the place is clean
Service is usually very good
They handle large groups very well
I went to this place twice, always give a place a second chance
Both attempts were not good
The first trip, they made me and my guests check everything at the door because they didn't want wet coats on the seats, etc
Well, they lost my friends Armani scarf and argued that he never gave them a scarf
The food was expensive and not tasty
Second trip was bad because the waiter couldn't help me find an authenticate chinese dish from the menu
The tofu dish I ordered was runny and not flavorful
Tasted sour like tofu going bad
Do your stomach and wallet a favor, stay away!!
Some of the best dim sum in Manhattan's Chinatown
Every time we go there is something new and exciting
Great plates of sauteed veggies with garlic, excellent seafood
Staff very helpful
This restaurant is excellent
Wonderful food
Great for parties or rendevous
If you don't like crowds, they have a basement floor where you can eat in solitude
I hope you will give this restaurant a try
THis is our favorite vietnamese restuarant
Food is quite decent and the staff is great
located in chinatown this place is a hangout for the elders of chinatown
The prices for all dishes basically stayed the same for years, hearty in portions and is served quickly
Youngsters and the elders mingle together in this asain takeout place because the prices are so cheap
I would highly recommend the iced coffee/milk tea if you like it milky, it's best place to get this cold drink
It's also located right across from the buses that take you to Alantic City so take out comes fast
the only thing if you don't mind is the extremely loud waitress that shouts out her orders to the kitchen
must also try the rice noodle rolls
filled with minced pork, scallions and aromatic dried shrimps
i dunt remember how much it was but it was probably 60 cents or something like that
and thier pan seared porkchops with sauteed onions over rice is exceptional as well !

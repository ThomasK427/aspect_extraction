Although we a sat down a bit later than expected the staff was very gracious
The sommeliers were very helpful and made a huge wine list less intimidating then we thought it would be
The food was wonderful and there was a lot of it
I particularly enjoyed the Lobster, (first time I have it cooked the right way,) and the chocolate dessert with a little pudding pop
We loved everything and suggest it highly!
The food and wine were fine, but the service was awful and rude throughout the whole night
The worst part came at the end of a full and expensive meal, when a friend stopped in to say hello as we were waiting for the bill to be processed
As soon as he sat, a waiter came over not once but twice, the first time to suggest he move to the bar b/c our large booth didn't accomodate an extra person, the second time to insist he move
When we got up to leave, the hostess was holding our coats as if to usher us out as quickly as possible
Holding our coats, but not my scarf which they lost
In the end - I would never again waste my time or money at such an overpriced and pretentious (even by new york standards) establishment
We really enjoyed the food, our favorites being the stuffed artichoke appetizer and the turbot entree
Service was extremely attentive - our gracious server did a wonderful job of pairing wines for us - but the final course was truly the highlight of the meal
The pastry chef (her name is Tiffany MacIsaac - keep an eye on her!) makes desserts that are not only beautiful to look at but also intensely flavorful, and in unique combinations
The sticky toffee pudding is outstanding, as is her nut-encrusted cheesecake
The ice creams really shine, though: pistachio, cardamom, and even a surprising but delicious Pernod-flavored scoop hidden in a rootbeer float
Everything was perfectly balanced on each plate: temperature, texture, consistancy
if they'll let you, go to the bar just for dessert
Now
Trust me
And the service is as well--the sommeliers are helpful, patient and knowledgeable
The atmosphere is great (where else can you find Christofle flatware?!) and the food is as impressive as the wine list is heavy
I have dined at Le Bernardin, Gotham and the like and the service here rivaled those establishments
We were seated at a table very close to the kitchen because we made reservations the same day
The staff could not have been more apologetic or concerned
They even gave us free champagne, hors d'oeuvres and glasses of wine on the house
PLUS, they moved our table to one further away from the kitchen as soon as they could
Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable, friendly, accomodating and hunky too! The food was inventive, fresh and delicious
I would certainly return
Food was good, dining room was empty and ambiance was off
Service was not good
Our server was not knowledgable of liquors available, and when asked to descirbe food she simply told us if she liked it or not, not how it was prepared or how most people find it
For all the hype, there are TONS of other places that are not as expensive and trump the quality experience
Too bad
Apparently like numerous others, we arrived at the restaurant on time at 9:30 and were told our table wasn't ready
Forty minutes later we were finally seated, and that the restaurant would be covering the bar tab while we waited
(Had I known that, I would've ordered more expensive drinks!) The rest of our dinner went quite well
The food was hit or miss -- I liked the crudo but was underwhelmed by the black sea bass and pasta -- but the service was polished and completely flawless
I didn't find the sommelier condescending in the slightest, and he recommended a wonderful bottle of Austrian wine
I had requested something under $100; he came back with a bottle priced at $72
We turned up on time at 8:30 to be told they are just finishing up at your table and there will be a short wait
While waiting, we had a drink at the bar
At 9 oclock the hostess came to say it would be only a little longer
But at 9:15 she reappeared to say the delay would now be at least an hour; would we like to eat at the bar (at Crus expense)
When we declined this offer, it became clear that there would not in fact be a table at all
It seems that the Maitred had given our table to some friends who appeared while we were waiting, and there was no other table available
When we left, the Maitred said only my position is indefensible
The moral seems to be: dont go to Cru unless you are a friend of the Maitred
The sommolier was extremely knowlegable and helpful
He was more than willing to recommend wines within a $50 price range (which is the low end at cru)
Still, the wines were great, and they have a nice selection offered by the glass and half glass so that you can try several of them
The food was good, not exceptional, and the ambience was a bit stuffy and conservative
I was definitely the youngest person in the restaurant by a few decades
I would recommend Cru for the wine list alone, but not for the food/ambience
While reading a few reviews i read that some are unaccustomed to the concept that NYC restaurants turn tables
We live in a city where space is a premium and as new yorkers we usually recognize this fact and any restaurant that has a chance of not failing needs to feed as many people as possible
Do we really want every restaurant to be an extravagantly expensive one seating place where you own the table all night? I would rather have more restaurants like CRU where you can eat and drink well downtown
My experience was terrific from the snacks before dinner to the dessert and everything in between
The wine list is the best i have ever seen and if these things are important to you then i recommend this place highly
If you are looking for avg food for money, a lackluster dining room with extremely rude service
this is the establishment for you
A celebratory business dinner took a turn for the worse when the management began pushing our server to an uncomfortable pace of food delivery
after making several requests to let us breathe and finish our wine, we were told that they had sold our table at 8:00
it gets worse
they added that they needed to turn the tables in order to let other New Yorker's experience their restaurant as the dining room is so small, and they are so popular
After a $1500 tab, the 4 of us were banished to the bar to finish our coffee and after dinner drinks
The food, the service (especially the friendly hosts) and the techy bathroom are beyond par
However, upon my next visit I'll request that the sommelier simply leave me and my fellow guests alone
I could do without his attitude and patronizing in the future
In fact, I'd prefer to not even see him orbiting the restaurant during my meal
This was a true dining experience
The rood was a little dark, but warm nontheless
Food was sensational as well as the wine pairings and service
We had the new tasting menu and with all of its options it was a true value
Just Great!
My colleague and I were looking forward to holding a business dinner at Cru because we had heard about its extensive wine list
Our reservation was for 6, but our party increased to 7 after one additional physician arrived
We made space at the table, but the owner refused to bring an extra seat (even though many chairs were available)
I'll be sure to go on every Web Site and tell everyone I know not to go to Cru!
Wonderful service as well as extremely knowledgeable and eager to please sommelier(s)
They helped choose great wines under $100 that complemented the very creative and tasty food
The chef seems to have his kitchen in order as each dish was its own unique experience and flawlessly executed
Of the three I couldn't decide which was best the Food, Wine or Service
I will be back
I love the transformation of Washington Park
The dining room is more elegant and less noisy than before and the food is 10 times better, in fact there is no comparison
The service is very warm and professional and made my parents (not sophisticated diners) feel at ease and welcome
The wine list is without question the best I've ever seen and the sommeliers are witty and helpful even with our less than expensive wine choice
you can spend a lot rather quickly there
but still many values to be had if you have time to look
I suggest viewing the winelist online before you go to save yourself and your dining companions the torture of reading 200+ pages at the table or just give the sommeliers your price range and preferences and let them choose
Either way the wine is great and I think the food is even better
Highly recommended
We had an amazing experience at Cru with fabulous,  creative dishes and wonderful service
The evening was  marred, however, by the sommelier who made numerous  condescending comments about how a $50 bottle of merlot  would not be a great bottle of wine and that we really  couldn't expect anything special in that price range
This was a huge disappointment and left a really bad taste in our mouths!
It's hard to believe, but the space formerly known as Washington Park has gone upscale! Chef Shea Gallante takes up residence in the former kitchen of Waxman, now walled off from the diners but visible through glass service doors
The broad menu is delicious, from a selection of seven crudo, to entrees including duck, lamb, venison, bass and soft shell lobster
I suggest the veal sous vide with black truffle mayonnaise
The dining room has been reconfigured, with the bar moved up front inside the entrance

The baby beet salad was so refreshing and light and the dessert was a symphony of flavors, strawberry, rhubarb and pastis
I can not wait to book another reservation
I can't believe I had never been before
I highly recommend this place
What an outstanding experience
I was here last night with my girlfriend for dinner and we had a wonderful experience
The service was very good and the cod fish was ther highlight of the evening
We go out very often and I am always happy when i find a good restaurant, with good value
We will come back
keep up the good work
This restaurant deserves any sort of attention in a city that's full of excellent dining choices
To sum it up: Everything is wrong about this place
It looks like it served a different purpose (like a studio or something) about five minutes ago
The service is SLOW: We ordered Cote de Boeuf and it took 70 MINUTES before we could finally start
And let me tell you: If you order a raw beef patty at Burger King it's gonna taste like the Chef's Choice compared to what we got
The meat was raw, and when i say raw, i mean it
The mushrooms were salty
The music sounded like at an 80s fashion show
And I couldn't get rid of the impression that this is the kind of place tourists go to because it sounds fancy, just to get ripped off
This is a definite NO
Went to Brasserie for restaurant week dinner and maybe it was the menu but the food was very bland and it was something that I could have eatten at home
I heard though that things off the regular menu taste a lot better
Definitely don't recommend this for restaurant week or the veal cheeks! The atmosphere was nice and very modern tho
Bathroom was cool, definitely check that out!
Ultra modern, great architecture, excellent service, fabulous food! Not our usual type of restaurant, but we were extremely happy with the overall experience
The service was very attentive and the food was great
Be prepared to spend $125 for dinner for two
Check out the bathroom!
We saw problems with our waitress immediately when she frowned when we opted for tap water instead of bottled
Then they brought out my soup, but no spoon and we sat for the next 10 minutes trying to get the attention of anyone in the restaurant to help us
When the waitress came back I asked if she could warm the soup - she sighed heavily, did not apologise, and took the soup away
At this point my wife and I felt very uncomfortable and approached the most senior guy there in a suit
We just wanted to leave, but he apologised, comped the meal and took over waiting on our table
His name was Renaud Amman
It was a busy Saturday in December in NY, we could have been tourists (we're not, I go to the Brasserie semi-regularly with work)
Will continue to go there thanks to Mr Amman
The decor--clean scandinavian--gives off a coolness that's matched by the futuristic photocapture effect above the bar
(Tip: Make note to look towards the line of screens after you enter!) Design gimmicks aside, Brasserie's food was impressive
I enjoyed both my side (asparagus), main (a yummy bouillabaise) and dessert, which the waitress recommended
Neighboring tables' food all looked great
Nice for a business dinner, perhaps not so nice for an intimate date since it gets noisy at peak
I was there last night with my wife, We live in the city and go out pretty often, the food was unbelievable and the service was great
We will come back again
Thank you so much and keep up the good work
Took my clients for dinner by trusting good reviews
I lost my face to my clients
The table (for 5) they got for us was the very end of dinning room where all waiters are rushing into kitchen and storage room
To make it worth, they donot have any other nice spots they could offer us (I made reservation much in advance, of course) and sent us a dead space where it took more than 15mins for the waitress showed up and asked us about first round of drinks
Food was very very average being on expensive side
I donot go back for the food, servise and for the cost
I went here yesterday for dinner and it was a Tuesday so it wasn't that crowded, but it was a bit too loud
It would be great for group dining though
I got the $35 prixe fix menu and everything was amazing
The steak was excellent and everything has an interesting twist
Service is great too
Definitely should go and try it once!
We came last week with some friends from LA and got blown away by the space
The food and service were impeccable and very fiendly
We will be back with a lot of friends
Thank you for that great evening
I came to the Brasserie with no reservation and they sat me right away
The service was very courteous polite and professionnal
The bouillabaisse was very good
The screen had a nice touch !!!!!! Very trendy place, we will come back
The place was very crowded, 5 minutes after we were seated at a tiny table, the waiters have pushed my chair 3 times and asked me to move so he could walk through
The food was BAD
The calamari were soaked in a cup of water and tasted like it was loaded with least 8 spoons of sugar
The waitress and waiters were slow and rude
The place was a disaster
I went with a friend of mine for a belated birthday celebration
I had received, via email, a coupon that stated Receive a $50 credit towards your bill when you spend $50 or more on your next meal
When the check came, they refused to take the $50 off
The person who came to my table said that the wording was not specific enough and was very rude to us
It was very unpleasant for this person to not honor what was clearly stated
The food was good, but I will not be going back there
It was an early evening on a friday and I didn't have a reservation here
I was seated almost immediately (party of 2)
I am very picky when it comes to having seafood
Here, I had the scallops appetizer and a 'seafood mix' entry
The manager was very thoughtful to have the chef make me a dish not on the menu to my liking
I was interested in a 'mix of seafood' (fish, scallops, shrimp), however, on the menu, the closest dish to what I had in mind was in a soup version
Put it this way, I am NOT a soup person
I was very pleased with my dinner here
Dessert was just as tasty!
We loved it the restaurant was awsome and the food outstanding
Very warm service
Mothers day was a hit, we will return thank you so much PS Thank you for the rose at the end it was a nice touch
Dined alone and still had a terrific time
Great place for people watching, the only downside is the noise (so it's not so bad to eat alone)
Fantastic waitress who was very honest about the best choices on the menu
Crab bisque was a big WOW, perfectly steamed mussels in the cream sauce were enough for two people, and the frites (served on a platter) were outstanding
Was full but wanted to try something light from the dessert menu -- the chocolate sorbet is to die for and there were three scoops!  Including drinks - also outstanding - my meal was $60
Definitely a deal
Without a doubt will return
I was there yesterday for easter and what an amazing experience
The waitstaff was very accomodating and the food was great
I'm glad there is still great places like this in new york city
Often people are very eager to criticize but forget to appreciate
Thank you so much to make that Easter so memorable
Can't wait to come back Thanks

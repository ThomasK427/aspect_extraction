I think the Japanese entrees are not that filling, but the Chinese ones are
The dumplings are excellent
Overall, a very nice dining experience plus there's a garden in the back!
very surprised at the low ratings
this restaurant is one of my favorites, with imaginative and varied sushi selections as well as delicious chinese food
i have NEVER had a bad dish, and i go almost weekly
the staff is very friendly and helpful
i recommend trying any of the special rolls, and especially dishes like the charred tuna
i am a big sushi lover and have gone to the 'fancy' to the 'not-so-fancy' and i have to say this is my favorite sushi place by far
the sushi combinations are genius, the price is great, the staff is very attentive and the space is cute
there are so many places to get sushi in the east village, but i literally crave the nippon roll at Friend House
i've been there a few times, and had take out and i have never been disapointed
their sashimi is phenomenal, the rolls are imaginative, and the prices are very good
i haven't had any chinese there but i would try it
The Scene Few Park Slope restaurants welcome such a wonderful mix: ladies lunch on long, paper-draped tables under the sprawling dining room's exposed wood beams; 30-something guys lean into the late-night oyster bar, and couples young and old enjoy quiet conversation in the few secluded nooks
Service is smart, casual and accommodating, whether it's your anniversary or your infant's first dinner out
The Food The New American menu is just as eclectic as the crowd, and dishes--though not as upscale as their prices might have you think--are solidly prepared
Every appetizer is a hit, from elegant, lightly acidic leek vinaigrette to tangy, meaty pork ribs served with flaming Sterno so you can char your own
Entrees are gigantic: double-breaded fried chicken with sauteed collards and creamy mashed potatoes serves two, and the duck BLT, layered on toasted wheat, is a triple-decker
The mushroom-onion-topped hanger steak with skin-on frites is a worthy signature
Blue Ribbon is simply fantastic
Since first impressions are everything, I hinted that I knew of a place here in Brooklyn that could satisfy any palate
Perrrrrrfect choice! My dinner date was ecstatic about the whole evening
She couldn't keep still, until the garlic shrimp appetizer arrived
Even the 1/2 hour wait was fine, we had a spot at the bar
I've been here twice, and have not been dissapointed
The food is wonderful, tasteful
The goat cheese salad is good, but the menu said wamr goat cheese and it was actually fried, and fried with something that tasted like a pastry on it, so it tasted like a quiche salad! But it was still good
THe red trout was great
THe wait staff if attentive and seemed to be always available
We went without resetvatiosn on a thursday night, and the place was busy, but we were sat right away
can't wait to go back
The wait was much shorter than the hostess quoted, which was great
Unfortunately the food wasn't worth any wait at all
I'm pretty sure that the mashed potatoes were from a box
A frozen TV dinner has more flavor than the food at Blue Ribbon
my girlfriend and I decided to try out Blue Ribbon Brooklyn, because I'm such a fan of the Blue Ribbon restaurant group in the city
my mistake in thinking the service would be similar to the service in the city
I waited at the bar, attempting to get the bartenders attention, while my girlfriend used the restroom
I still had not gotten his attention when she returned and we waited another 5 minutes before I was able to flag him down
I was so disgusted after having to wait so long, we just left
the reason for his inattention
he was too busy flirting and buying shots for two girls sitting at the bar
Years ago we tried Blue Ribbon when it opened, and the first meal was wonderful
However, the second meal was atrocious, and we never went back
We would like to go regularly, however, so we tried the 2006 Restaurant Week dinner, and it was still atrocious
One of the two entree choices was half! a cornish game hen, which I orderd
To my dismay, it was too salty to eat, and also, it more resembled a quail in size, providing only about 5 bites of chicken
My spouse order the brisket, and it was inedible
It was hard as a rock,tasteless and dry
She just left it
We couldn't get out fast enough
What a shame
This place is great
The oysters are very fresh
Definitely get the bone marrow for appetizer! Not many places serve this but Blue Ribbon makes it perfect
The hanger steak, fried chicken, cheeseburger are all excellent
The owner is always there and always friendly which makes this place a place that you want to return to again and again
Went there with some friends for the first time the other day
Overall great experience
The food was great and the service was top-notch
Healthy poors at the bar too
Will be going back
My boyfriend and I had another perfect evening at Blue Ribbon for New Years' Eve
we had extremely helpful and friendly host staff and skilled waiters and servers as always
The food was amazing as always, particularly the oysters and main course steaks
The decor is laid-back, dark, and friendly
I love it
Good thing this restaurant is right across the street from us
Our favorite
I intially went into Blue Ribbon because Time Out saying they have Brooklyn's best burgers (which they do) but since have been back for everything else
From the oysters at the bar, to the entrees to the dessert, the whole food experience is top notch
The service is solid
The only complaint is that they seem to have a very hands-off policy regarding children
Literally I have been in there with children screaming and running amok, and the staff has done nothing about it
Granted, Park Slope is a very child friendly place, but it would be nice to see some restaurant owners enforce a little civility, or at least gently remind diners that their children are out of control
(This isn't just at BR, but it does oddly seem to be the worst here
) But if you dine a little later at night, it shouldn't be a problem
I took my parents to Blue Ribbon here in Park Slope a few weeks ago
They loved everything, especially the chocolate bread pudding for dessert
Our only complaint is that that it's too popular
Getting a table on the weekend can be impossible
We had quite a wait, and they wouldn't take a reservation
The drinks were awesome, the food was excellent, the service was great
This really weird couple next to me spilled wine on me though, so my advice would be to get a reservation that is a little more secluded than the one we got
I adore this place, and it's usually the first place I suggest when someone says let's eat! The bar and bartenders are stellar (except for short martini glasses)
The staff is very attentive, the menu extensive and the food always first rate
I went to Blue Ribbon for dinner tonight with a few friends, and everything was really great
The food was delicious, especially the dessert that we had - a chocolate chip bread pudding
awesome! All of the people who worked there were super friendly and courteous and wanted to make sure that we had everything we needed
All in all, it was a great time and I would definitely go back!
great place, great food, prices are a little pricey, open late a definite plus
i just wish they wld drop some staff though, sometimes you feel like your being stalked by waiters, waiters helper, waterperson, busperson, food runner, supervisors, managers
etc
I wld give the service a higher rating if i was left alone a little more, they can be around so that when i need something i can get someones attn easily but let us enjoy our meal and company together
Tried to get a table during restaurant week but there was an over an hour wait
They only take reservations for parties of five
On top of that they have a separate list for parties of 3 or 4 compared to parties of 2
The list for the party of more people was a 45 minute difference (30 minutes compared to 1 1/2 hour)
That is a very ridiculous waiting system

The food was very, very good and plenty of it
You will not go away hungry
The cheese plate, which can be ordered as an appetizer or main course (as most appetizers can be had), had fruits and cheeses that blended well and complimented each other
The salads were delicious, as were the main courses
Seafood, steak, chicken, pasta, vegetarian
Prices were more than reasonable and I noted that they have a lovely brunch menu
My friends and I have made it our mission to make sure that the word gets out about this hidden gem of a place
Well, maybe not too much word!
Charming, romantic, hidden find located in a small, below-ground space
Food was good (excellent salad) and moderately priced
Dessert was very good
You have to be a robot not to like this place
My wife and I were so excited to dine here
Unfortunately, the decor, ambience, service and food were all terrible
Decor - Grandma's apartment without the charm
A lot of unrealized potential
Ambience - The kitchen is not completely walled off (Curtain wall), and we heard every word the server and the chef were saying
Not exactly romantic
It was too bright and none of the candles were lit
Service - Our server wore a grimy apron
He was quite slow, which was inexcusable, considering we and another couple were the only people there
Food - The cheese plate contained flavored spreads instead of decent chesses
The entrees (Ham/broccoli/mashed potatoes, and Beef stew) were flavorless and simple
The desert, a butterscotch pie which our server said was homemade, was simply a Jello butterscotch pudding pie topped with Ready-whip
$80 (incl
wine, tax and tip), WAY too much!   Please improve!
they got all types of cigars
i mean everything from cuban to american
it is a realy big selection of cigars
I've only gotten delivery from wasabi boy
The pad thai is the best in new york, although it's only available for delivery after 3 pm
It's definitely worth the wait
The delectable combination of noodles, peanuts, sprouts, chicken, and a squirt of lime makes my mouth water
I've lived in the neighborhood for over 24 years and never realized what an amazing Mexican restaurant was within walking distance
Highly recommend the Ceviche and the frozen margaritas
The fajita and the seafood soup are also delicious
Do not let the dark windows dissuade you
once you open the door you step in to a fiesta! Great food, good prices, and they are open late (2am) on the weekends
My husband, myself and another couple discovered Las Margaritas purely by accident after walking around Astoria Saturday night looking for a place to eat
We were very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food; the ceviche was the best I've had and the other dishes we tried we also wonderful
The mariachi band added a very festive air and we felt transported to Mexico again
The ait staff and bartender were the best
You MUST try this restaurant
You won't be disappointed
Get the sangria but try the Margaritas too
OLE!!
After having enchiladas suizas in Mexico City a couple years ago, I was saddened to find that NONE of the Mexican restaurants in New York make anything remotely resembling them
until I went to Las Margaritas! The decor is a little odd (black-light murals of Mexican history??) but the food really is the best I've had since coming back from Mexico--including fancy overpriced Manhattan places
Definitely worth the trip! I love it!!!
This place is amazing
It's been in my neighborhood for a couple of years, went there for dinner one night
The best Mexican in Astoria, for a reasonable price
The margueritas were fruity and the mariachi band just added to the already wonderful ambiance
Their brunch is out of this world, too
Im hear to spead the word as to how great this place is
I think it just needs more business
LOVE THIS PLACE
I LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND GO HERE ALL THE TIME WITH MY FRIENDS FROM OUT OF TOWN
THE CERVICHE IS CHEAP AND REALLY YUMMY
THEIR MARGARITAS ARE VERY MODERATE IN PRICE TOO AND ARE DELICIOUS! THERE IS SOME COMPARISON TO RIO GRANDE'S IN NYC
JUST IN A TRADITIONAL MEXICAN SETTING AND REALLY NICE STAFF OF MEXICAN WAY! :):)
My husband and I order from here almost every week
The food is even better if you eat it in
Personal favorites are duck salad with pinapple and apple, mango and avocado salad, green curry, singapore noodle
The pad thai isn't bad either
After Thai Pavillion made a great success in Astoria, two more Thai restrant opened few years ago
This one, unfortunately only serves some sort of Chinese take out
I gave it several tries, but only ended with dissapointment
What a great place! I am moving into manhattan from astoria and this will be one of the reasons to come back
Wonderful food and a nice staff
My Girlfriend and I love the place! If you are in astoria go there
Best food of the three Thai restaurants on 30th ave
I went to this thai restaurant with my friends
At first this place look like a take out thai restaurant but they have nice seating area un like chinese take out
There were pictures of food all over
So it was easy for me to pick my dish
The food were great and great
I had papaya salad and it was very tasty and spicy (I asked for it!)
So it you are around astoria, I recommend this place
This is a semi take out style Thai restaurant which is located on 30 Avenue between 3334 Street in Astoria
Thier menu is huge and has many choices
I tried Sauteed tom yum seafood and it is a great great dish
If you are around that area, don't miss them
I always go to Chips when I'm starving for a great and satisfying meal
Their carne asada and tampiquena is so tender and full of flavor
I usually don't finish the food off my plate when I go out to eat but every time I go to Chips, I always eat everything on my plate
You can tell that the chef actually took the time to make each item on the plate taste great and the presentation is excellent
This place is pretty small, but the service is very friendly
I live in Sunnyside and my boyfriend and I go here about every month-every other month when we are in the mood for Mexican
Their cuisine seems to be fused with Italian a bit, and the frozen drinks are excellent
The waitress is very sweet and attentive
i really love this place
it's always great food, and they make a wonderful sangria
i've particularly liked the quesedillas, the mole, and the enchiladas
I have to disagree with the previous posting- part of the reason my boyfriend and I frequent this place is because if the service! Everyone is so helpful and friendly, and our food (which is delicious always) is efficiently and promptly delivered to our table or home anytime we order
We seriously go here at least 2 to 3 times a week! It's our favorite place to go in Astoria for a good, quick meal with excellent service
They say one should never judge a restaurant based on its delivery but rather what its like to dine in it
Unfortunately for Soho, thats part of the service they offer, which sadly isn't very good
The food itself is fine, plenty of variety at affordable prices it is a strong competitor to all the traditional diners in the area
The restaurant looks nice, slightly trendy in its own little way

small place, but comfortable and worth the duckets
I'm Chinese, so when I hear tacky names like Excellent Dumpling House or Jade Golden Dragon I immediately get skeptical
BUT! Sammy's wasn't like that! It was very modern and clean and the menu had a huge range for very reasonable prices
Sushi there was EXCELLENT and what I ordered was authentic chinese, even though the menu had no chinese on it
Portions are good and service decent
Groups would probably be comfortable there
This was one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan
Then this summer, they redesigned the interior and replaced their weakest dishes with some fantastic new ones for a menu that is can't-miss, top to bottom
Definitely the best for Asian food -- and now with the makeover, my girlfriend considers it a special date when I take her there
If you're not from the Village, Sammy's is on the corner south from the West 3rd St exit of the West 4th (ACE-BDFV) stop
My friend and I went here only because there weren't any other places with outdoor seating that didn't require reservations in the vicinity and we were pleasantly shocked
Most pan-Asian places cover a lot of geography, but the tradeoff is lackluster food
The dishes we had were actually very good, here, running the gamut from Vietnamese spring rolls, to Thai basil chicken and bubble tea, to sashimi and tempura ice cream
All of it was really very well-made
This seems like a great place to go if you have a large party with lots of taste-bud variations
Gracious staff
Fun origami decor
I didn't have sushi when in Brasil and this venue makes me wish I had
The Samba roll (Eel, Avocado, Mango, Salmon, Shrimp Tempura) is habit forming
My fave local spot for a sushi dinner
Shiki's offers an excellent mix of traditional sushi and Japanese food with some of his experimental Brazilian-inspired rolls
Service is fast and friendly and the prices are unbeleivable
The place is covered floor to ceiling with owner's paper cutting artwork, which gives the place a very homey feel
Shiki's the place to be
great sushi
very friendly staff, and even more friendly owner! The best value for sushi in NYC
Shiki's got Brazilian themes mixed in with Japanese
his art work is definitely a conversation starter
You'll love this cozy den
This is a true restaraunt
no tourists, no fluff, just real character and true personality
The food is excellent and inexpensive and the owners are so kind
if you like sushi and art you will love this place
the owners are incredibly friendly and nice and the restaurant is decorated with this great art
the owner is also an artist so there are cool funky drawings and masks and things decorating the place
the sushi is reasonably priced as well
it's small and cool
not romantic though but a great place to have dinner with a friend
This place is nothing fancy but the sushi is amazing
they do $18 all u can eat - which is outstanding value as its sushi and sashimi of the highest quality
The place is tiny and very basic but if you have a sushi craving this is THE place to go
BEST FALAFEL HANDS DOWN! One of my favorite quick lunch and dinner spots on the UWS
Amazing, fresh ingredients and friendly service
Could have a better drink selection but the Food is amazing so it's worth a visit!
I've stopped going here considering the surly service and poor value
The quality of their food is not up to their relatively high prices
If you do experience a problem, forget about expressing your concern to the owner
Upon doing so myself, I was told that there was nothing wrong with my order and to get out and eat elsewhere
I did and will
one of the first places i went to in NYC, it's just as good as mammus, but not nearly as trendy or known, you won't be disapointed
I went to Blockheads for lunch at the beginning of the summer and wasn't impressed at all
The space was nice since they open all the front doors but very busy
The food is pretty sub-par since I like fresh and visually enticing food
The portions are definitely large but the quality of the food is just not there
Also, forget about the cheap, watered down drink specials
Maybe it's me
but I like a good Margarita and this just wasn't cutting it
My friend ordered the mojito and was equally unimpressed
Usually there is fresh mint, but not in this one, just black floating leaves
yuck! All in all, I would not recommend for the food or drinks but I guess I can't expect better for the prices
We love blockheads and go there at least once a month
For the most part it is awesome, but sometimes the burritos will be dry or the chicken fingers will be in a smaller portion, but overall we love it
They have great salsa and huge portions, which, for the price are hard to comeby in this city
By far one of the most entertaining brunch options in the city
You get unlimited Momosas in a Margarita glass and great food for under $10
If it is nice out, be sure to sit outside in the back
Great atmosphere to catch up with the gals
Highly recommend them
The service was also attentive and we had the manager stop by twice to check on us
Food portions are LARGE!
I was just there on friday night, and can't say enough about it
The service was great, the porcions are good to feed 2+ people, and flavorful
The place was fun
I highly recommend it
I dunno what this other posting is complaining about
maybe they forgot your food b/c you were 'difficult' with them on the phone demanding soy or organic garbage
which you won't find here
Their burrito's are pretty filling and good tasting
The nacho's are enormus and are enough for 4 people
Their delivery was under 10 mins and was impressed by it
They have a large selection so you will find something to eat
We had the worst experience
We called once after an hour -- they said they'd check up on it
We called again after an hour and a half -- they said they'd check up on it
We called again after an hour and 45 minutes of not moving from our desks so we wouldn't miss the call, and they said they tried unsuccessfully to deliver it, so cancelled our order
On top of that, they charged us for food we never received
AND, on top of that, the manager was rude
Was there once a few years back, and I remember a bustling, trendy place with great decor and a fantastic looking, flirtatious waiter
But I don't remember what I ate, but it was decent
I think it was a little pricey, though
High-end restaurant with excellent atmosphere
Beautiful on the inside with 2 huge custom Waterford crystal chandeliers
I have had the seafood, lamb and steak many times and have never been dissappointed
Extensive wine list
Prompt service
Will not fail to impress
Our third visit, I won't review based on just one time
Food is okay, service needs some work
Quite convenient if you're going to MSG as we were - they should sit all the noisy, rude kids elsewhere or give the parents a lesson on manners themselves
When Chef is on the mark, food is good

The chicken satay is the most scrumptious thing i have ever had, the peking duck is out of this world, the green shrimp is fabulous
In addition to the delicious food, it is a very sexy place with a great vibe
This is a must visit for all chinese food lovers
Great on a date or with a large group
Call and get reservations ASAP before it is impossible to get in there!
I decided to try it out since i heard that the chef used to work for many years at Mr
Chow
What a dissapointment it was !!! Rude stuff, food tasted horrible (not even close to tast like food in Chow's) and boring decor
I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone, not even the bridge and tunnel people !!! If you want to have a great meal definatelly go somewhere else but there !!!
I have to admit, Japanese isn't my favorite cuisine; but I was really surprised at how good my food was
I actually enjoyed it
I feel like the only spice associated with Japanese food is wasabi, so I usually find any other entres to be bland
I went in for lunch and we got seats quickly
My entre was quite flavorful and the presentation was well done, comparable to more expensive restaurants
Not your typical take-out sushi in a box
Actually, for a Japanese restaurant, I found the price inexpensive and they have a lunch menu (you know how some can be)
Anyway, I have to admit this is the first time I've really enjoyed Japanese cuisine
Even more than the food I had in Japan!
My husband and I came across this gem of a restaurant several weeks ago
First of all, the decor is very simple and inviting
I always prefer the corner spot
The service is attentive and friendly
Lunch specials are a great deal - fresh sushi for a fraction of the cost at Blue Ribbon, delicious tuna steak for $10
50, etc
I couldn't give this place a higher endorsement
Service, atmosphere, prices, food
all outstanding
A few other reviewers recommended the pepper tuna and they couldn't be more correct
The rest of the sushi/sashimi just had a fantastic fresh taste to it
I'm looking forward to going back
If you are looking for a great sushi restaurant in soho area, you are looking at it
Once you are here, you cant resist yourself to comeback again
Great quality food, worm and cozy atmosphere, good price, and friendly service will definitely make you regular customer of Nagomi
Sushi lovers!!! Do not hesitate to try Omakase the chefs special
It's good stuff
Very cozy restaurant where the service and the food are as good pleasant as the price ( great bargain!!)
For a one on one dinner w/ a loved one or a small group gathering I highly suggest Nagomi
It's quietly become my restaurant of choice
Mostly I come here for lunch because I work in the neighborhood
The sushi is always really nice and they've usually got some wacky special for you to try
By wacky, I mean good
The cooked dishes are pretty special too
I do like the risotto that they talk about in the review
I'm not even a huge uni fan but somehow it works and gives you a nice warm/satisfied feeling
I don't drink alcohol unless I want to take my pants off over my head but the sake list looks pretty cool
I'm not sure that counts for anything
Part of what I love about this place is that it's warm, friendly and easy
The stark contrast to my evil office probably helped spawn my love affair with this restaurant
It's like being in therapy, only you don't lie down and it's cheaper
it was very nice having dinner and some sake
i had omakase sushi
i could enjoy nice fresh sushi with very reasonable price
specially pepper tuna was so~~~good! and grilled squid salad was really good as well
Nagomi is a Japanese Restaurant with a twist of modern flair
The atmosphere is warm and cozy with a friendly waitstaff
The sushi is fresh and melts right in your mouth
The Nagomi sushi specials are all worth trying
You MUST try the pepper tuna!! They serve a number of dishes from the kitchen and the ones that I tried are all unique and extremely addicting
The dishes burst with flavor and each one has its own color
I highly recommend the green pea pancakes topped with mushrooms
They also have a generous wine and sake list
so, if you're trying to steer clear of the typical Japanese sushi restaurant and looking to redefine Japanese Restaurant, check out Nagomi
You might just find yourself going back to try out the whole menu
I discovered Nagomi on the way to my regular sushi spot in soho
I tried a combination of sashimi and steak
Both were excellent and I was impressed by the selection of sushi and suggestions by the chef
You need to be picky where you eat sushi and their quality is excellent
Very friendly staff and comfortable environment
The prices were also resonable
Actually I just tried it for lunch and was surprised by the value! I now have a new regular place to eat :)
I was not quite ready for a delightful surprise when I walked into this simple Japanese restaurant in Soho
Stern sushi chef makes to the point clean sushi that highlights the freshness of the ingredient and Uni Risotto from the kitchen is simply a BLISS!! Great food accompanied by friendly service all at a very modest price that is very rare in this part of town - can't go wrong with that!
My friends and I stumbled across this restaurant after a day of shopping in Soho hoping to get a typical Japanese dinner
We were pleasantly surprised, however, by the unique menu and reasonable prices
Apart from the standard sushi menu, this restaurant had a variety of their own sushi and roll creations as well as some cooked fusion dishes (including a roasted duck that my friend ordered which that turned out to be delicious)
The service was friendly and the ambience was calm and soothing
Overall, I had a really get experience here and plan to stop by whenever I'm in the area
It's the best meal you'll get in that area for your dollar
I have been looking for a good japanese restaurant in SOHO area and I finally found one
Most of all, their memu is quite interesting
Kitchen stuff has a touch of Japanese fusion - like Uni risotto - but sushi bar menu stays still in authentic Japanese cuisine
Looking for new and fresh experience of Japanese food? Definitely try Nagomi
Start with today's special appetizers, which are incredibly delicious and unique; order Omakase Sushi then you can tell how fresh and various fish the chef wants to serve
Even Nagomi sushi set comes with Toro
simply the best deal
The food is southern-styled
I had porkchops with mashed potatoes (they let me replace the sweet mashed with regular) and sauteed pears
Very nice
The server was very friendly and accomodating but just a little flaky
Way above average for a server in many places I've eaten throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn
The decor was the best, but if you would be offended by gentlemen's cabinet paintings (i
e
mostly naked women) while you are eating, this is not the place for you
Otherwise, I found the decor amusing
The food rocks! I also love the mac n' cheese, the hanger steak, the salmon and all the desserts
And I hear tat brunch is fantastic! If you haven't been, you gotta go - Earl's Kitchen is going to become one of your favorite dinner spots in Brooklyn
Man is it hard to get what you pay for these days
But what a great suprise it is when you can go somewhere not expecting anything and be blown away?! I went to the tainted lady, well actually to drink
but, I was cordially approached by the staff and asked if I would like to order anything from the kitchen
I said what the hell and got a hanger steak

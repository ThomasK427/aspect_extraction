My neighborhood Sushi restaurant offers better food, for half the price
Great sushi, down to earth staff, great food, good service- the best!
I went there with a friend from out of town
and we were both very impressed! Went on a Monday night, so there was no wait for a table
The sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick
The price was right too
The atmosphere was just okay
Space was limited, but the food made up for it
I'd go back there in a heartbeat
Great value sushi with high quality nice setting
Good for late night dining (last minute planning) without reservations
Try the Chef's Choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty
I can't say enough about this place
It has great sushi and even better service
The entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need
I've been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date
I've been to sushi restaurants the world over, and none can compare to Blue Ribbon Sushi
Remember these names when dining there and you'll leave a happy person: Gunkan, Dragon, Arctic Char, Chuwan Mushi, Uni
There are a few pretenders, but this is the real deal
Your a sushi fan, you love expertly cut fish, great sake, a killer SOHO location, and of course: Salmon, Tuna, Fluke, Yellow Tail, Cod, Mackeral, Jellyfish, Sea Urchin, Shrimp, Lobster, Sea Bream, Trout, Milk Fish, Blue Fin Tuna, Eel, Crab, Sardine, Monk Fish, Roe, Scallop, Oysters, and a varity of Toro
There is only one place on the east coast that has it all, plus a lot more
Better than nobu, tomoe, taka, yama, sugiyama, and the rest
Bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world: BLUE RIBBON SUSHI
Believe it baby!
Top of the second division of NYC sushi spots
Nothing spectacular at Blue Ribbon, but it's lots cheaper than places like Nobu and Sushi Yasuda, and the cosy, tucked-away ambience is nice
Very rude on the phone and in person
The location seems ideal, but beyond that other Ethiopian restaurants in New York City have better food, better service better value and much better ambiance
Essentially, you pay for the location and little else
Okay, so it may be an intimidating dining experience for some: no utensils, communal plates, etc
but let me tell you that you won't regret it!  Flavor combinations are great, and beginners should try the combo platters
Yes, some things are spicy (but there are also less spicy options) and there is a boiled egg in the chicken dish, but the two are related
Strangely enough, this place makes the most amazing tiramisu I've ever had
great for groups (I've had a couple of b-day dinners there), good service, fun meal, warm hand towels and wet wipes at the end
this is the first time i had ethiopian food and i was glad i went to Ghenet ,i really liked it the flavors were sooo delicious and authentic
The bread was the bomb ,we took the leftovers home and it was even better the next day
But my husband wasnt crazy about it,especially when he saw the boiled egg in the chicken dish
amazing value off mulberry
delicious beef and veggie platters to suit every taste, carnivore to herbivore
newcomers to this amazing cuisine will be converted as i once was, experienced diners will be delighted as i am now on a regular basis
warmly recommended
It's true what they say about the service: it's not fast
But our waitress was very pleasant and willing to explain the menu to us (we'd never had Ethiopian before), and we weren't rushed out the door, which makes a nice change in NYC
A good place for a conversational and inexpensive date: the combo platter for 2 is a winner (get the siga wett - it's delicious)
Good food, but bad service, uncomfortable ambience, not particularly good value
We were party of 2 waiting on a 3rd person who was just around the corner, and the waitress was going to make us wait to be seated, even though the place was empty
We had to ask repeatedly for water, to order, etc
The ambience is not particularly nice or stylized, uncomfortable seating with lights shining into your eyes
Good food, but not very good value
I'm not fussy but I would be disappointed if a date took me here
This is definitely a must-try for restaurantgoers
The food is tasty, exotic, and reasonably priced
The service is attentive and the atmosphere is pleasant
Also, scooping up the food with the delightful spongy bread is fun, especially when sharing a platter as a couple
Whereas many places have gone downhill over the years, this one remains consistently good
Great food, friendly service -- what's not to like? My favorite part is bringing friends who've never tried Ethiopian food before
Highly recommend the combo platters -- that way you get to try lots of different tasty dishes
I first went to Ghenet with a friend to try Ethiopian food and was blown over
I have since been back 3 times and have taken everyone from my family to friends, who have all loved it
The food is great and the service good
Ethiopian food is very original tasting, yet good
So if you are up for trying something new, try Ethiopian food, and do it at Ghenet
I have been to other Ethiopian restaurants in New York, and this is by far the best
Eating Ethiopian food is a totally new experience! Everything is served and eaten with injera, which is similar to a pancake in texture - no forks, just scoop up the food with the injera and enjoy! Lots of fun and great taste to boot
Very vegetarian-friendly
It was a little crowded the night I went, and so the service was not as attentive as I would have liked, but it was still decent service-wise
There are quite a few beers and wines to choose from as well, but *sigh* no dessert is customary in Ethiopian cuisine, so we stopped off somewhere else afterwards for my sweet-tooth indulgence
Overall, we had a great time there!
Simply put, Ghenet is amazing in almost every way: friendly staff, warm ambiance, and most importantly great ethiopian food
After finding a number of hidden gems in Philadelphia and D
C
- Ghenet was my first ethiopian experience in NYC
Great flavours
I have been here twice and both times the food was excellent
Very flavorful! Highly recommended!
There's nothing prohibitive about Ghenet, even for the beginner to Ethiopian cuisine
Hot towels to wash your hands, yummy food with a variety of spices (both hot and not), and wines by the glass recommended for each dish
A hit
In Short The curvaceous sushi bar at stylish Mottsu draws a healthy proportion of diners who truly appreciate the interesting dishes concocted here
There is a familiar assortment of sushi and sashimi, including some specialties, such as the lobster tail tempura roll, and the Cholesteroll, with crab, avocado, egg and tempura flakes
The kitchen also serves up an intriguing variety of dishes, such as smoked lamb steak, tilefish with baby clam sauce and Spanish mackerel tataki with gazpacho sauce
Friday night and we needed a quick bite before going out
The 5-7pm meal deal was a pleasant surprise
For $15 we dined on delicious tiny smoked hor d'ouevres, fresh sashimi, great sushi (my man had chicken teriyaki), miso soup (or salad), green tea ice cream and green tea
Great value and not too filling
We will indeed be back
I never have to wait more then 10 minutes to be seated
Food is great
Service is prompt
Best Rolls I've had in the city
If you feel adventurous, order your non standard Japanese dishes
Unlike most other neighboring restaurants, Mottsu offers a nice, quiet relief to the pretentious, overbearing chic restaurants in Nolita
Mottsu offers a good selection of fresh sushi and kitchen entrees for a reasonable price
Mottsu is getting worse and worse! The food is beyond terrible quality wise
The sushi is fishy and the pieces small, the entrees smell like institution food
Very disappointed
I have been going to Mottsu for years and not once have I ever been disappointed
I would recommend their tuna salmon sushi and sashimi
Their rolls are not that fabulous
The atmosphere is clean and non-pretentious and the wait staff friendly

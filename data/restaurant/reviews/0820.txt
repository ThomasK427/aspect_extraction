The waitress was English-language challenged and did nothing to make the situation right
Management was nowhere to be found
Bad experience; with so many other options on 5th Ave, why bother with bad service?
My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week and always bring our friends
Everyone loves it
Great service, great food, great wine, what more could you ask for? I've tried something different every time, but the pastas and seafood are the best!
This place is one of my favorite little sushi places in the city
The service is very friendly and the sushi moves quickly so it;s always fresh
It is a little small so probably not good for groups of more than 6
Good sangria nice ambiance, but I'd draw the line at having a full-on meal here: sauces are salt-laden, meats are overcooked vegs are tasteless
Stick with a few plates of Tapas + a pitcher of sangria you'll probably be better off
Food here was excellent and the wait staff was attentive
We didn't sit at the bar, but noticed that they had some great finger foods
Looks like a fun place to have an after work drink, but I'm not sure what the scene is like at that time
Great selection of tapas
I don't know why I keep going back to this place
It's probably because it's one of the only bagel places in Chelsea
They consistently have tough (I think they're overcooked) bagels
And not cheap! I usually end up paying around $9 for a bagel sandwich, not including juice or coffee
And don't get me started on the surly staff
Please someone open another bagel place in Chelsea
I had read about Murray's bagels and found a minute on my way home to DC to stop in and buy some plain bagels
They were wonderful
Absolutely no need to toast them, it would be ridiculous, they're perfect as they are
Murray's were the first and have been so far the best bagels I've tried in New York
The should they toast argument is a no-brainer: The point of toasting is to crisp the outside, leaving the inside soft and chewy
Murray's bagels are perfectly made, already crisp and soft all in one
The cream cheese and lox is highly recommended; it's not exactly cheap, but you get a mountain of delicious cream cheese and high quality lox
Also notable: The North Chelsea location has the advantage of big windows looking out on the unmatched Chelsea-boy parade on Eighth Ave
This place is totally retarded but I eat here almost all the time for lunch simply because it is close and they take debit cards no matter how little your total is! I swipe $0
87 all the time, it totally rocks
But, if you do go here, there are only two things worth your time and money
Either the make your own pasta, or the make your own salad
Everything else is a complete rip-off and tatses bland
What the guy below didn't know about the salads: DO NOT get the large size that costs 10+, get the small size that is 6
95 and just load it up with as many toppings as you want and the thing will weigh a ton when they hand it to you, trust me
Just take advantage of the unlimited toppings thing
And for ranch dressing? Who really cares? Try something different (and better) for a change
or are they? i recently went to cafe metro for the first time and was greatly disappointed
first, no ranch dressing! what salad place doesn't carry ranch dressing? that's like a pizza place not making cheese available
oh, and my salad was completely drowned in the dressing i ultimately chose
finally - and this is my biggest beef - the price for the salad was a whopping $10
99 (the same salad with the same toppings typically costs $6
75 or less at similar lunch venues in midtown)
I had a fabulous time at the rainbow grill
the view was wonderful and the waiter was very informative and actually provided great menu reccomendations
I am not the type of person who likes to rush so I enjoyed the time the waiter gave to enjoy the view, drink, and food
The chicken marsala melted in my mouth and being a chocolate lover the chocolate cake is the best i have EVER had, so rich and orgazmic!!!my date and i had a fabulous time! so memorable i felt like a movie star!
$750 to reserve
Took 4 hours to get through the meal
Most of the time spent chasing down the Captain Apparently, none of the other waiters can talk
The view was nice
but for that price, I could've booked a balloon ride
Lets start by saying reservation mean nothing
Humm?? Many people in the dining area in jeans and no jackets??? What happened to the strict policy? We were there for our Anniversary - very disappointing
They are understaffed, drinks go unattended for 1/2 hour or longer, food is bland with no presentation, and you CONSTANTLY have to waive your waiter down for everything! Including your check - and that came out wrong as well!!! You get better food and better service at Olive Garden!
This is one of the most famous restaurants in NYC, so on a recent trip I made reservations for two
We arrived early and got to take in the great view and snap a couple of pictures before we were seated
The service was so poor, our drinks were left empty for over half an hour
We had to flag down the waiter a couple of times before he even noticed us
The waiter didn't go over the menu choices and at the end of the night we were so fed up we didn't even order dessert
Our food was overcooked, bland and overpriced
I was extremely disappointed and so was my date
We will not be dining there again on our next trip to NYC
NYC however, was fantastic!
The service is awful and the prices are obscene, but the bagels and baked goods are delicious
It pains me a little to patronize this establishment because the people who work there are slow, often rude, and likely to mess up your order, but I keep going back anyway because you can't get a decent bagel anywhere else in this neighborhood
If another bagel store were to open up near by that had good bagels, even if they were slightly less good than pick-a-bagel, I would gladly go there instead
Until that happens, however, I will continue to get my bagels at pick-a-bagel
The place is great to go eat after you watch a movie at the theater that's right across the street
The food is excellent, the service is great, the decoration and environment is pretty cool
I would reccomend you try the buffalo wings, the stuffed chicken with veggies and cheese, and the burgers which are made of real meat
The plates might not be too inexpensive but they are at a moderate price
I usually don't do chain restaurants in NYC, but sometimes I come here when I feel like pretending I live in suburbia (especially after seeing a movie at the theater nearby)
It's slow, though - the service is friendly, but I can't figure out why it takes so long
This place serves true authentic peruvian food
Their Causa (mashed potatoes stuffed with either tuna salad, chicken salad , or shrimp) is delicious
Lomo saltado and Jalea are really good although the Jalea in Pio Pio is better
The only drawbacks is that this place is located in an isolated location and it can get pretty crowded during south american soccer matches, which requires you to make a reservation
If you want to try true cuisine from Peru, this is your place
This place is a really decent looking hole in the wall that serves WONDERFUL Peruvian food, for moderate prices
The only problem with this place is it is packed, you will wait an hour to get your food
Go on a weekday night and you will more than likely be the one eating there, but try it on the weekend and bring a good book to read or your friend that never runs out of something to say, because you WILL be there for a while
order the sushi buffet
when asked what you would like to drink ask them for water with a slice of fresh lemon in it
she will bring you a miso soup
enjoy it
now the fun part
fill out your sushi card
i highly recommend the salmon, black pepper tuna, spicy salmon and spicy tuna
these are my favorites above all else
i hope you come to love this place as much as i do
good appetite
Food here is excellent if you're a sushi lover like myself and friend, John Cho
We go here every Tuesday night to take advantage of the fresh fish and the awesome sushi buffet for $15
99
I have to admit, the selection is not as great as some of the more trendier Japanese restaurants, say in the city, but still great food at a great price! But even if you're a regular like us, don't expect any freebies
These folks never provide any little free appetizers, which really irks me
The food isn't anything to write home about, but this place is great if you want to kick back with an inexpensive bottle of wine and some traditional Italian food
The fried calamari is really good, and their white pasta sauce is too

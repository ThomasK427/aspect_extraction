My boyfriend took me to Meet for Valentines day and to our disguist, we were seated squashed in between 2 other couples
So much so that the waiter could not put the food on our table but had to interrupt the other people every time
A truely awful experience, looked like they tried to cram as many people into the restaurant as possible
I read about the ambience of the restaurant, but was disappointed when I arrived
My guest and I first sat at a small table next to the bar for pre-dinner drinks, but I did not realize that it also meant no service before dinner either
The bartender had us get up and walk the 3 steps to pick up the drinks
Food was blend and overcooked and the waitress kept on coming over every 10 minutes to ask whether if things were ok, do we want to refill drinks (when my drink was half full!!), and etc
We almost invited her to join us! Then of course, we had to order our desert before we were ready b/c the kitchen was closing and please pay your bill NOW b/c the machine is closing NOW as well
meet has changed for the worse since it first opened
we were seated at a table near the bar - first mistake - shortly after 10 the bar filled with an obnoxious b+t mix who began to spill into the dining area
mid-entree, one bar patron decided to use the empty bench space next to me to place his coat (which i promptly threw to the floor in disgust), and shortly thereafter another person took the votive candle off our table to light his cigarette
to top it off the food was mediocre and the waiter inattentive
the only saving grace was the hostess who witnessed the smoker and apologized profusely - had she offered to comp a drink or dessert i would have considered returning
as apologetic as she was i will never return - the worst dining experience i have ever had in my own city
The atmoshpere was nice, but the food left something to be desired
We were the 4the table of the evening to be seated, and they were already out of their appetizer special- Huh? Either way, I recommend this place for exactly what the name implies Meet, but only for a drink
I really enjoyed MEET - my friends who live in the city booked a table for Friday night and it was a total happening! The food was great, service was good, the bartender makes a wicked mojito and the atmosphere was just super! We went for dinner and staggered out after 2am, the place was still packed and the DJ was spinning some great music
I have recommended the place to my friends and I look forward to my next visit
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
The worst dining (if I can call it that) ever! We were one of the first tables seated for brunch but it took close to 2 hours to get a dried out, tasteless, overpriced, lousy meal by completely incompetent service
Don't even get me started about the staff running back and forth to the deli across the street to buy food they were out of
Wait an hour for the table at Pastisse or straight to the Little Pie Company but don't ever meet at MEET!
I love this place, it's qute unique:great food,music,decor and ambience,very friendly staff
It's just impeccable
I highly recomend this place to all from 21 to 91 who like quality from food to beautiful and well dressed people
Love the decor, ambience, and the food is really yummy
Not pretentious at all
staff is friendly
I threw a bday party here for 12 people and we had a fantastic time
I went with a couple of friends to Meet and found it to be an enjoyable experience
Service was good and the staff was pretty hot
Food was good - though portions are kind of small
Bar scene was the best part - good place to actually meet people - but not at all a meatmarket
Great space and decor--that's why you're really there anyway
Drinks were good; food was great
Overall a great experience
If you don't want trendy, don't come to this neighborhood--stay on the UWS
A little over the top on trendiness, but still really good, Meet is a great place to go out with your friends
There's a variety of mixed cocktails, and the flirtini was the best
The caipirinha and the Pap's Cup were okay, as was the margarita
The heirloom tomato and goatcheese and walnut appetizer was yummy! The lobser was the best thing on the menu for about $31
The pokr wrapped in bacon in a clam sauce with polenta was also really delicious
The lobser ravilioi appetizer was nice, which was made into an entree portion
For dessert, try the chocolate cake that comes with burnt honey ice cream and a pistachio cookie
Check out the bathroom sink as well! The service was nice and the food great
the setting is very attractive, and don't forget to wash your hands at the communal sink, but the place is nothing spectacular
The meetito is very good, but not all of the drinks are spectacular
The prices are of course pricey, and the staff needs some prompting
I didn't eat, so couldn't really tell you about that
Crowd is attractive, but not too
MEET is definitely the in place to be seen or just hang with friends after work
if you're looking to be seen, than this is the place to be
with waif-like models hoarding the bar scene and an overload of beaufitul people at every table, meet feels more like it's neighborhood of meat than anything else
food is edible, but the scene is all the rave!!!
Overpriced, for under quality
How long do you think this place will last? Hope the investors aren't looking to make a profit
PS- it sounds like a lot of the reviews here are written by friends of the owners
This place is awesome-the bar is very condusive to conversation and checking out everyone in the place
The drinks are fabulous, the decor is great and the deejay plays some great funk and jazz
good time!
Granted, everyone's beautiful, the decor is amazing, but there's no substance
It's all look, and no depth
If i'm going to pay $30 for an entree, i expect to not just get a plate of well prepared food, but to ultimately have a dining experience
And that includes professional service
As well, there's nothing really special on the menu
Personal experience tells me that when you pay a heafty price for food, there's some sort of delicacy offered
I felt as if i was being asked to pay $20 for a burger
MEET was really a lot of fun
I was very surprised about the quality of the food
I was expecting so-so food from the meat packing district
We ordered food at the bar and it was really interesting and delicious
We were out late, and it seemed more like a lounge than a restaurant, but that's fine with me cause it's relaxed and fun
It was packed and service was affected by it, but not overly so
Besides, unless you're just there to eat and run, it's a good thing
Most good lounges charge covers and usually have crappy food and ok drinks
At meet, I don't mind paying for a good meal, IF it's a GOOD meal
I really resent some places downtown that charge premium prices for really bad food
Finally, meet is great, all the things you really want, great food, great music, beautiful people, comfortable
Alright food, good service, alright decor, awesome neighborhood
Worth to swing by
i have been here twice for dinner and one time for drinks
the food is good and well prepared and the wine list is fine
the design of the room is beautiful and imaginative
however, they still have some kinks to work out, most importantly timing on the food
both times when i was there our entrees came out while we were still eating our appetizers! really, BOTH TIMES I ATE THERE! one time i ate there and it was packed, the next time it was deserted
i saw them filming a sex the city episode there the other day, so it will probably get crowded again after that airs
MeetLESS gives you a dance club w/o the dance floor a restaurant w/horrendous service and limited menu selections (the ONLY steak is a top sirloin?!!!) Meet succeeds at being poor at both
Nice music
way too loud for dinner
We were in a group of 6
Two ordered app/salad the tasty, fatty lamb shank came out 30secs after the appetizers
Our dinners went back under the heat lamp (Thanks!!!)
By the time we finished the first course, everyone else in the group were done w/ their dinners
Adding insult to injury, the waiter had to ask for the wine bottle by number (where are we? in a chinese restaurant?) just b/c he couldn't pronounce the wine we ordered
Then he brought out the wrong year!!!
No steak knives, no cream for coffee, unattentive service (I had better service at a buffet!) Bottom line
I too recommend that you meet elsewhere!
SIMPLY PUT: FABULOUS
My girlfriends and I had great food, great service (we LOVED the hostesses and our waiter was adorable!) and a great time
So what are you waiting for!

The place is gorgeous
It was a good experience all around
I went there with my on my aniversary and I while I enjoyed dressing up, I found it was a place that could be casual or fairly fancy
The meal was spectacular! The calamari is definately recommended, as well as the chocolate martini, and the chocolate balls! The service was wonderful, and I feel the meal and service was worth every penny, but be sure you make reservations
The only thing the Pearl Room is good for is checking out the locals
I would recommend Samms instead
The food was loaded with salt and garlic, ugh
The service was inattentive to say the least
On the whole, an overpriced bore
This is a great restaurant
Went on a Friday night and had the calamari appetizer which was excellant!!! Tuna for main course was very good
The portions are generous and the service was good! Will definitely visit this restaurant again
I have been looking for a great sea food restaurant for a long time, I found it
The menu is 80% sea food
I have been to the Pearl Room many times and have never been disappointed
Grilled stripped bass, sting ray, tuna steak, chilean sea bass, excellent
Maybe I went on a bad night, but I had a bad experience the one time I went to the Pearl Room
I had reservations in the middle of the week for 8:00, but was not seated until 9:30
Once we were finally seated, the table next to ours was literally 6 inches away
We had to wait over 30 minutes for the waiter to come take our order
and it was impossible to get their attention throughout the meal whenever we needed something
The food was just average
Although all of my friends say Pearl Room is one of the best restaurants they have ever been to, I will have to disagree and say it is just average
Even though I live right around the corner from the Pearl Room, I will not be returning there anytime soon
Extremely satisfied with our visit there
They cooked fried shrimp off the menu for a picky eater although all there other choices were magnificent
Tried Espresso, as it is near my favorite bagel place
Crust is mushy, sauce tastes metallic and cheese tastes like cheese food instead of mozzarella
Skip this dive and head up to Pizza Wagon
I had my baby boy's baptism affair here a few a days ago
I was impressed by the level of service and kid freindly staff
Food was great
dessert was awesome
the ambiance was very warm and cozy
There was a fireplace in the dining area
I wonder if it is a working one
if so, it would be really cozy
There's valet parking
wish I knew earlier instead of circling for parking around the restaurant
Live Entertainment on weekends
service was good
we ordered the Coconut crusted snapper
the seabass and the filet mignon
all were nicely prepared
Would definitely go back and try the others on the menu
I've been to many places Chadwick's tops them all
Its very hard to eat out w/ 4 kids, and being Asian often get the cold shoulder
But not here, host/servers were welcoming and good with kids, no kids menu (expected from upscale places) but made accomodations
MEAL about $20-45, or pre-fix dinner at $18
There was no plate charge for sharing
I was w/ 5 adults and 6 kids (all under 8), kids shared Chix parm all finished (impressive)
We garrived 30 min prior to reservation seated within minutes
In hour half we were done and way out and valet had car waiting
We were not rushed, service was quick, excellent and FRIENDLY
Glass of house wine was huge @ less than $7
I just can't say enough of this place
When I am in NY, forget others
CHATWICK'S is the place for me to go
Like so many of our other favorite restaurants in Bay Ridge, Chadwicks is top notch
The food, service and decor all help to enhance yor dining experience
I guarantee you will be tremedously satisfied
Chadwicks serves as the Steak House for locals as well as City-ites who can't help but love this place
Luger quality with Bay Ridge ambience
Although generally an older crowd, us 20 and 30 somethings can find ourselves at home (especially after you see the size of the shrimps in your cocktail or when you hear the pianoman play)
Take a date or your significant other - or even your buddies
No matter who you bring - you will be sure to enjoy yourself and the food! Bon apetite!
The food was fantastic
The stuffed shrimp were out of this world
It is a little pricey but worth it to have a great meal
I am recommending this place to everyone
Staff was very polite and always trying to please
Enjoy
After watching Chadwicks highlighted on an episode of Food TV Best of, I had to visit for myself - and was not disappointed
The portions are more than generous, the food was fantastic
Also - the manu was extremely creative
I went to Mesa Grill and was disappointed
But this place is impressive
I had the pistacchio crusted lamb chops - highly recommended! The staff was great - and all guests are seated by the owners
Executive Chef Russell Titland's confidence and expertise shine in beautifully presented, thoughtfully prepared food
No trendy frills, nothing extraneous - just no-nonsense, excellent food
Basically traditional menu could have been boring and old-fashioned, but is instead updated enough to please modern palate: steaks, seafood, fish, poultry - ample portions (we took half home), seasoned with care and imagination
You're repeatedly reminded that Chef and staff are experienced, capable professionals
I had sage-and-prosciutto-wrapped veal tenderloin; my companion had duck with delightful cranberry relish; both served with carefully complementing, delicious sides
Creme brulee dessert was light, wonderful, served in portion big enough to share
Even house wine by the glass was better than you usually find
Don't expect trendy atmosphere: room looks like it could have been designed in 1940s, but who cares - it's actually comfortable and inviting; with great food and unbeatable value, you can't go wrong
After 5 tables that came in for breakfast after ours were served finished eating, our food finally came - and it was not what we ordered
Although it is cheap, it's not worth it for the extremely poor slow service, and average diner fare
I've eaten there about 10 times over the past 4 years, sorry I went there last night
The last 2 times were not up-to-par so I tired one(last) more time
The appEtizers took 30 minutes and with 4 people they were not served all together
It's not the staffs fault(only 2 waiters)
The bruschetta was on untoasted bread with only chopped tomatoes (no seasonings) and some cheese
The tuna was over cooked and the potatoes burnt
Was really disappointed with the service and we left without dessert(something we never do)
I have had my last meal at tuscany,thanks for the past great meals , but for now on FORGETABOUTIT!!!'
Heard a lot about it so I went with my wife
It was a very charming and cozy place
Beyond that, I would rather go to Elia around the neighborhood
If you like Lupa, Babbo, Il Mulino, or Scalini Fedeli, you will be disappointed badly

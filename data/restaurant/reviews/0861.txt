can't wait to return!
Good food, service and a nice Italian wine list located within a festive LES neighborhood
What else could you ask for
Oh yeah, a diverse unpretentious crowd and a pleasent decor
I love 'inoteca and have never come even close to being disappointed
The service I've received has always been stellar to the point that I often leave it up to server what wine and cheeses I'm having
I will note that I've not been in the evening, which I'm to understand is busier and certain troubles come along with that
Considering the menu, it's an absolute bargain
I always feel like something must have been left off the bill it's so low when it arrives
we had a really bad waiter who had an attitude problem
the menu was in italian and he wasnt really interested in translating it for us
we ended up having a really hard time trying to order our food
maybe its just our luck but going out for dinner doesnt have to be that stressful
Excellent food (especially the cod specials and cheeses), great wine, and very friednly service
Only drawback is a long wait pretty much any night you go
Try it for brunch to avoid the crowd
One of my favorite all-time places
How can you NOT love inoteca? The wine is DELICIOUS, the food is great, the waiters are friendly and knowledgeable
The first time I went it was 2 a
m
on a Sunday
I grabbed a seat by one of the big, open picture windows and had a great time
The paninis are wonderful and the truffle egg toast is to die for
The menu's a little hard to decipher if you don't know italian, but the waiters are more than happy to help you
The wine list is very extensive and wonderful and affordable
It's a tight space, typical of LES, but the crowd is friendly, so it's not so bad
All in all, inoteca is fabulous
And you have to have the prawns
DELICIOUS
The buzz seems to have exceeded reality here
First off, the noise makes conversation difficult when busy
And the wine list, while focused on some interesting Italian wines, is not cheap
By the glass, it's more limited
Small plates can be large, like the meatballs
But the food, while good, is not really on a par with some other top Italian spots with small plates (i
e
, il Buco)
And while the atmosphere is relaxed, the overall feeling when things are hopping is anything but conducive to relaxation
The original restaurant in the west Village, 'ino, is better
Stumbled in there on Saturday on the recommendation of the bartender's girlfriend, who we had met over at Vintage
We sat at the bar (the wait for a table was 2 hours) and David (the bartender) took care of us by selecting a delicious italian pinot noir in our price range
The food was fantastic
we had the potato salad with pesto, tomatoes and snap peas which was SOOOO good
the polentas were great too
we had a selection from the cheese list, which disappointingly had no special bread, olives, etc
Went there on a sunday with my boyfriend and had a wonderful time
It's totally casual and relaxed - you don't feel remotely rushed
Everything we got was amazing
My suggestion is to start with a cheese plate and an assorted meats plate to share and enjoy your wine with
Every plate is small and perfect for sharing
After that go with about 3 plates
I strongly suggest the truffled egg toast
Also enjoyed the pasta-less lasagna and the meatballs
We had no room for dessert at all
Left totally happy and full
Completely reasonable prices too
Can't beat it
Oh and they serve food very late which is always good to know
We will definitely return
Inoteca made me, my friends, and, possibly, the whole rest of that week, better
The wide was delicious, the food was divine
but, BUT
it was the service that blew us all away
I can't say enough about how well we were treated by both our foor and wine servers
it was absolutely impeccable
If that was all this place offered, I'd be back; but they offer a true experience in fun food and wine
Bravo!
I want to take my waitress from Inoteca everywhere
She was always there before we knew we needed anything, had perfect suggestions, and she answered every question with an informative answer
Inoteca could be quieter, (I think get there by 7ish to get a table with no wait) but the wine is amazing, and yes, the plates are small, but ohhh so tasty
The key is not to go when haven't eaten for the last 24 hours
;) Go to have wines you have never heard of and will want to remember the names of, whose compliments are tasty little bits to help them along
The grilled calimari is *scrumptious*, and the must have is a cheese plate ordered with assorted meats, and for dessert, make sure someone has the roasted fruits and someone else has the expresso with ice cream
Everything about Inoteca was fantastic, service, food, atmosphere!! The paninis are to die for, and don't miss out on the meatballs
The small plates are a great idea, grazing is wonderful
I couldn't be happier that 'inoteca is doing so well
When it opened up near my boyfriend's apartment, we went and fell in love with it immediately
ALL the waiters/waitresses/owners/hosts are warm, welcoming, and know EVERYTHING about EVERY item on the menu
The food is DELICIOUS: the salads are fresh, the truffeled egg toast is amazing, and the cheeses are out of this world
Plus, the wine list is so extensive you can't help but find a selection to savor
My favorite is the light, bubbly Presecco
This place is terrific- YOU MUST GO! =)
ok people, enough with I couldnt understand what all those words in in the menu meant
c'mon
this is NYC and you were practically in Little Italy, by this time you should ALL know what a bruschetta means and if you dont
start getting some italian language classes
Anyway, we were 4 to start with then 6 and ended up by being 11 and that was last Friday
Joe (one of the owners) was a darling, the place was totally packed, the wine delicious and the food outstanding
Thank you guys
we'll be back!!!
We were thankful for our incredible server, Jeffrey
The menu is impossible to get through you have not spent a summer in Italy
Jeffrey acted as our decoder
He knew every dish and was very well versed with the Italian wines
Just tell him what you like! Everything was delicious and we really enjoyed ourselves in this relaxed and friendly atmosphere
Good looking crowd helps, too!
Friday night, 4 top, packed
Waited longer than expected for a table because the hostess was out of sorts
Food was just bad
Porchetta was utterly unremarkable

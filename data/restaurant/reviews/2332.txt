THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE WINE LIST WHICH COMPLIMENTS THE BEST FRENCH CUISINE I HAVE EVER HAD
As this was one of my girlfriend's favorite restaurants, we went for Valentine's Day
Unfortunately, the horrific service turned our romantic evening into a miserable dining experiences ever
It took 1 1/4 hours to get our appetizers (how long does salad take) and when we complained to the manager, he barely listened
The pathetic service continued, old glasses were not removed; so we had a collection of dirty glasses
The horrendous service could have been somewhat redeemed by special food, but it did not rise above mediocre
When I found the manager to complain that they had ruined our Valentine's Day, he was dismissive and argued that the service was fine
His only concession was to buy us a glass of champagne at the bar after dinner; of course we did not want champagne, all we wanted was to get out of there and never return
Well my friends, If you don't have a fax machine, don't bother calling this place!!!! They will not reserve a table for you unless they get a fax back
I don't know about you but I leave my fax machine at work
I eat out all over NYC and have never had a problem making a reservation before
wow what a nightmare
By the way, After I gave them a fax number they never bothered to fax the paper over
The manager was no help either
So it's off to Daniel for dinner
I hope you have better luck than I did
first off, food was good
that's for sure
you won't be disappointed in taste wise
but VERY snobish staff
if you don't speak french, don't even bother to go there
i'm the kind of person who looks for friendly warm atomosphere
if you just want to enjoy the good food, this place is great for you
but if you also want to make sure you will be treated nicely though you don't speak or read french, you might not have much fun there
The food is fantastic
A nice surprise on the upper east side
The chicken in black truffle broth is incredible
Definitely a pricey place, but I've enjoyed every bit of food that I've had there
Thoroughly enjoyable meal and evening
From start to finish it was perfect
My wife and I found the wait staff very polite - they do not hover but seem to know just when they are needed
I had the poached black truffle sausage as a starter
and for an entree had chicken in a black truffle broth w/veggies
It is on the pricey side, but I think well worth it
It was all delicious and we look forward to going back
This is like the owners living room and if you can befriend him and the staff you will for sure come back
The food is great and the atmosphere is so relaxing
If you can catch a futbol game here you will see all the Frenchy's come here to watch
It is an engaging experience and one that should not be missed
Try the Steak Au Poive it is excellent
We ordered for our office, and we could not have made a worse decision
Although the order was for 6 people, it was incomplete, and the food was less than amazing
When calling to report the missing food, we were completely ignored
I recommed spending the extra dollar for Blockheads to get a quality taco, and a complete order
Fresco Tortillas, Happy Tortilla, Fresh Taco
they all are the same restaurant, yet they each have different names
The only reason I can see for them doing this is because they know that their food is horrible, so maybe if every restaurant has a different name, people will be fooled into trying each one
I'm sorry but the chefs in the back need to stick to their own culture's cuisine
I had dinner at Merchants on Saturday evening
I ordered the cod fish and got a plate full of potatoes
There was a small piece of fish sitting on a huge mound of potatoes
My friend order chicken in pesto spaghetti
Her spaghetti was drenched in too much sauce
The ambience and service was very good
I was very disappointed with the food
I would have told the wait staff if anyone had asked me if I enjoyed my meal, but no one asked
I would not go back to this restaurant again
I've been to this place twice, once for dinner (had the recommended scallops which were so spectacular and a really tiny portion), and once for dessert (had the apple crumb cake pie and wine at the cigar bar downstairs, very delicious but was lukewarm in the middle)
Honestly this place is me and my bf's little kept secret for a romantic late night rendezvous
There are small hidden rooms downstairs and during the weekdays, there's hardly anyone there, you can cuddle up with your Boo in one of the dark rooms and have dessert and wine under candlelight
The service downstairs is great
Recommendation: skip dinner and head straight for the cigar bar
My bf arrived a little early at the restaurant
He picked a seat in the back and specifically told the waiter that he was expecting me
He described how I looked and what I wore
He gave the waiter our names
He also told the waiter that my phone was dead and I did not know where he sat
When I got there, the waiter said I don't think anybody is waiting for you
But would you like to sit at the bar or go downstairs to the cigar bar while you wait? So the entire night my bf and I were in the same restaurant but different sections, because of the irresponsible staff
What were they thinking?
I was just there this past weekend for a girlfriend's birthday! I've been there about 5-6 times in the past, and all I can say is that I love it! I've been there with my boyfriend, and groups as well
Overall the food is an 8-9! Menu is limited but with a variety! It's not 4 star, its not meant to be, but a truly great place to drink and eat
Awesome atmosphere! Great place for happy hour as well
Eat at a table by the windows and overlook 1st avenue, or sit in the back in a dark, dim-lit lounge in cushy couches and chairs
VERY TRENDY! Great fro a girl's night out! Everytime I bring someone new there
they LOVE IT!
Went on a Friday night when things should have been happening
Nope, not crowded at all
Place was tastefully furnished and has all the makings of a hotspot but I don't thiink that's what they are going for
Cigar bar downstairs, great for smokers
Nice place to catch a few drinks with friends
If you're looking for something a little more energetic, this is not the place
I used to work here and it's a great place
It's one of the only places in NYC that will still allow smoking so if you hate smoke, DON'T COME HERE
It's common sense
As for no bill splitting, suck it up and do the math yourself
The waiters here have enough to do and they do it well
Maybe some people are just too cheap to pay for more than what they ate
Every since the smoking law went into affect I have enjoyed the clean smell of places
Since this is one of the cigar bars every smoker in the world is there
It just makes the place stink
Also if you show up in a group, they will NOT let you have separate bills
So there is always the hassle of trying to settle up at the end (and since there are people always coming and going, someone has to take charge
That person ALWAYS gets stiffed)
You would think that they would let you have separate bills as long as the were all tabs
I guess the Wait Staff doesn't have the brain cells to handle it
nice port menu cozy lounge dowstairs live jazz and house great for large groups because of confined side rooms the late night menu is good but the menu overall belongs in fridays not a place that is as nice as this
Merchants was a very nice restaurant/bar/dance hall
The inside was very well furnished and would definitely get the grouchest person in a good mood
The food is good and reasonable priced

A big bowl of rice, with 4 strands of chicken for the low, low price of $10

I guess you are paying for the priviledge of eating in SOHO
NOT!!!! This meal was so unsatisfying, that I literally asked them if they ran out of poultry
I had to stop at a deli and buy an extra chicken breast just to get some protein
Be forewarned
a big waste of your money
That is, unless you think a bowl of rice is worth 10 bucks
Depending on what night you go, you may have to wait a while for a table but it's most definitely worth it for the price and the quality of the food
Try the Merkelbach -- as a person who dislikes white wine I was very surprised w/this one
The one downer: waitress was snooty
This tiny Soho place serves cheap delicous food
There's always a wait, but if you're in a hurry you can always go next door and take it to go
Make sure you try their Mexican soup, their arepas, tamales and teas
They also have a sweet selection of specialty honey
just found out about this place and i've been there twice this week already
something about that black rice does it for me
true to it's name, rice is the thing here
there are 5 or 6 unusual varieties and it comes with everything
cheap as you can get and more wines by the glass than you'd expect at a place like this
service is completely neutral, which works for the setting
i'll be back
This restaurant is very simple and to the point
Anything you order off the menu is good
Rice is definately a place to meet friends or when you are on the go they have an amazing take out
The new DUMBO location is a treat!
At this very service-oriented SoHo bistro, you will find attentive service and generous portions of tasty food
For appetizer, you must try the pastry-wrapped goat cheese
Also, the escargot ravioli is an adventurous choice, but a darn good one
Stay away from the very fishy mussels, though
For entree, the duck was OK, but the braised lamb and scallops special were better
Not to mention the filet mignon, which was cooked to perfection
Oh, and the bread, was very artisan - very good
We had a wonderful meal at this bistro, the Foie grais was exceptional and the soft shell crabs was the best I ever had in NY
We will return for sure
We happened upon this restaurant last night and it was the best experience I'd had in a while
Attentive but not rushed service
Great food, great people watching!
I stopped in here after a miserable dinner at Kin Khao, and thank goodness I did so, because it more than made up for a disastrous dinner
We enjoyed some wine at the bar, and loved the charm and ambience of this terrific bistro
This is an enjoyable time for anyone in the neighborhood, and I highly recommend that those nearby stop in for a visit
My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to have a midnight dinner on a recent Saturday night
After we tried Blue Ribbon and there was over an hour wait, we happened upon Bistro Les Amis, which I had read about in Zagat's
We couldn't believe how uncrowded it was---and on top of that, the food was wonderful---I had a red snapper special with kiwi mango salsa (YUM!), and he had the gnocchi (ALSO YUM!) Equally deserving of mention is the ambience and the service: this place is so cozy, and quiet, and romantic
and they were playing the best old-time music (Edith Piaf, and Sinatra-ish standards and such)
Also, the waitstaff was SO friendly and hospitable---we felt so welcome and catered to! Merci to our new Amis---we will definitely be back to this Bistro!
Went there with a group of 7 this past Saturday evening
Literally everyone agreed the food was excellent all the way around
I had the Crab cake w/ lobster sauce appetizer; filet with bernaise (one of the best steaks I've had in recent memory) and the chocolate souflet was rock-em-sock-em ridiculous
My girlfriend had pasta with shrimp, mussels, scallops, artichoke hearts and olives - which was also incredible (both fresh and light while still hearty)
The atmosphere is relaxed / romantic, and has a very neighborhood bistro feel to it - thanks in large part to our waiter Shane who was great (nice, funny, knowledgeable, courteous)
Check it out when you can - the food is well worth it
I think it's rare to eat at a place where reasonably-priced food is consistently so excellent across 3 separate courses
We ate at this quaint little corner restaurant when we were on vacation back in June and loved the food then, so we were back in NY and decided to eat there again, and the food was even better than the last time
had a filet mignon that I could cut with a fork it was so tender and tasty
the service was top notch, I will come back everytime I'm in the big apple
LOVE IT!!!!
Went over Labor Day Weekend
It was the busiest restaurant in SoHo, so we figured we could not go wrong here
WHAT AN ABSOLUTE DELICIOUS EXPERIENCE! My steak was excellent, My husband has boulibasse which melted the taste buds
The waiter was very informative and suggested a complimenting wine for both of us
Topped it off with a creme brulee which was perfect
Will be back!
Taste bud check, please!! Although I did enjoy the house salad, the rest of the dining experience was pure crap
Our lovely evening started with our waitress telling us that the steak frites was, a regular cut of meat
Despite that tempting description, we ordered it medium
It came back well, well, done
Sent it back and we noted that this time it was medium rare, but what the hey
After choking down that hideous cut of meat, an employee comes to our table and says that they cook their steaks to order
Then informs us that the steak was medium rare adding that she wasn't trying to insult us
So the obvious conclusion was that we must not know how we like a steak prepared
Are you kidding me?!? Apparantly they have magical we-never-make-a-mistake powers!Save your time, money and your patience
PLEASE!!
We have never been disappointed by a meal served here
Like most it seems, we stumbled into this restaurant quite by accident one night but have frequently returned since
The service is great, the food amazing (good sized portions), and you can top it all off with one of the best chocolate soufflets in the city
We have never had to wait for a table, and the waitstaff is incredibly knowledgeable and courteous
When in Soho this is the place to eat
Stumbled upon this restaurant last Saturday night and had dinner on the sidewalk cafe
Had a very informative waiter who suggested the filet mignon
The best steak I have had in a very long time
My husband had the softshell crab which was excellent
We topped it off with a chocolate souffle which was to die for
What a great find and reasonable too
Plan to come back again and again
We went to Bistro LES AMIS with a large group for my husbands birthday - they accomodated us in every way
The food was fantastic - - the wait staff was attentive and with a large group, they got everything right
If you want a chill place with great food there is no better
The outside table are such a nice draw, but this was truly the worst food I've had in a long time in this city
I could tell the whole story, but let's just get to the point
Ordered steak frites, medium rare
Got served a piece of meat so well-done, Daniel Day-Lewis could've made a Manolo out of it
Sent it back and waiter warns us that it WAS medium rare, so next piece will be even more cooked
Mortified, we cry out, LESS cooked! LESS cooked!
We get back a less cooked steak, alright, but understood why the first one was deliberately overcook -- the meat was grey through and through
Must've been there since Soho was a dangerous, abandoned 'hood
AVOID AVOID AVOID
The snotty attitude from servers didn't make up for it, either
first rate bistro, the filet mignon with carmalized onions was great, the staff there are very friendly it is good to have a place like that in soho
one of the best values in the city

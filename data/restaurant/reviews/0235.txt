Food is awsome, although they're all pricy
Try the sashimi! they're really fresh
One of the best Lychee Martini on the planet
Music is a bit too loud, and lighting is a bit too dark
but it's a nice place to impress your date
oh, and the kobe beef at tao is a bit overrated, you can grab better kobe beef elsewhere :p
I have been to Tao 5 times, and each time it has been great
The longest we have had to wait to be seated was 25 minutes, and it was 8:30 on a Friday night
But forget getting in without getting a reservation 2 weeks in adbvance
The food is awesome(the desserts are great, too), and the staff are extremely nice
Atmosphere takes your breath away
I highly recommend it
I just went to Tao today for lunch since it's restaurant week
I ordered the steamed vegetable dumplings, kung pao chicken, and chocolate raspberry wonton noodles
First of all, let me just say this place looks a lot bigger on the website than in person
The atmosphere is great, the music is nice, and it's great for a group of friends or a date
The food was okay, and my overall opinion was it was OKAY
It is pricey, and i did enjoy everything, but I wouldn't go back
The service was alright, but you get better service with a group, or at least it seems that way
First and foremost, the food is great
The fortune cookie dessert is now my all time favorite NYC dessert, and I have eaten a lot of dessert
The space is beautiful, it really is, but they really need to do something about the sound
The roaming bongo player--though very good-looking--did not help the situation one bit
We walked out hoarse
Seeing that we had to wait for our reservation for 30+ minutes, we had quite bit of time to watch the social experiment in the lounge
It was like watching a car accident
I have never seen so many desperate scenesters in one place before
Tao is beautiful
Upon entering you realize that the restaurant is much larger than it seems on the outside
My favorite part of the restaurant was the large buddha and lotus pond
Unfortunately, the food fell short of my expectations, the kobe beef was sauteed in a way that made it too salty and nothing else I ordered really made my stomach beg for more
On the upside, the bar was happening and filled was good looking people
The waiters and waitresses are great eye candy as well
Overall, I would go for drinks but, the food seems a little overpriced in relation to taste
I went to TAO with my girlfriend last March
We had ninja sake, lacquered roast filet of pork, thai fish hot pot, the angry dragon roll, pad thai noodles, and the molten chocolate cake for dessert
The food was good overall and service was fast
Although we made reservations weeks in advanced, we still had to wait approximately 30 minutes before being seated
The ambience seemed more like a nightclub than a restaurant
We didn't expect it to be romantic but was also didn't expect that type of atmosphere either
This restaurant is definitely better for groups than couples
If we decided to come back we'd likely bring our friends along
The epitome of New York pretense
The Emporer has new clothes and he wears them at Tao
Usually you lose food quality the trendier you go, but not at this place
We went here for our New Years Eve dinner and had a great time
we were the last seating before the New Years Eve crowd
great service, didn't rush us out, food was unbelievable
second time here and had a great experience both times
Love it! Oh and the DJ spins great music there
I was visiting New York City with my sister and we went to Tao and I had the sushi I have had better sushi in Little Rock, Ar
I order the eel and I think they must have forgotten to put the eel in
No taste of eel at all
They were like vultures in trying to get us out of there
I was eating on my salad and the guy came over there 3 times to take my plate
Finally I got tired of him asking so I told him to go ahead and take it
When we were eating out fortune cookie we wasn't done and he came and just grab it
My sister had the shrimp plate and absolutely no taste to it at all
It was very over priced for the quality of food
I dont personally recommend the food there it wasnt special or any thing
I prefer having drinks there the ambiance is amazing if you are single this the place to be
its kind of expensive though but its worth a visit
While this place might once have been chic, exclusive, and perhaps even classy, it is now a mecca for tourists and BT crowds
For a place that some still consider very trendy there were MANY tacky outfits on the prowl last night! Furthermore, the staff (well, one staff member) was unbelievably rude
I placed my sweater on the tree on the top of the steps that leads to the 2nd floor b/c it got too hot he says to me, We can't have that here
There are more professional approaches
Unfortunately, no one has given management the message that this place has lost its luster
It's not as appealing as it was when it opened
The drinks are still fabulous! Haven't eaten there
The food was fantastic, the drinks outstanding and a great atmosphere! Prices were great also
Went 9/17 on a busy Sat night to celebrate our anniversary
Our reservation was at 7:15pm but parking was impossible so we were late at 7:35pm
There were about 4 girls upfront, 2 were nice friendly but the other 2 were very good ignoring their guests
We were seated on the 2nd flr after 10mins wait
The design is very eclectic but space is cramped, you can barely sit get up with their seat arrangements
The music is loud definitely not good for conversations
The waiter who served us was nice entertaining, food is good but not something to die for, price is alright except for the drinks which cost more than our food
I would recommend Tao if you go out with a group of friends who likes to be seen see people as well
If you think this food is even in the same ballpark as a Chinese take-out place, you need to get your head examined
I've never ordered Shabu Shabu by saying L27
Try the Shabu Shabu w/ filet mignon and you won't be disappointed
The pork dumplings aren't great, but the Chilean Sea bass is
The original desserts are pretty damn good
The room is loud and music is quite unnecessary and annoying, but if you can overlook that, this place is great for a date espeically for the 20-30 somethings trying to show off
Who doesn't love fine dining in an exotic setting? This place can be a bit too loud and too much going on for dinner though
The food is great and the bar has awesome apple martinis
I walked out with few chop sticks before
LOL!
Go to any inexpensive thai or chinese place, and you'll get better food
Duck rolls are pre-made and soggy
All chicken dishes are super-saturated with salt (to get you to drink more?)
Music is lousy and deafening
Thumbs down
I came here with a large group
We sat at the rose petal table right by the Buddha
The decor is absolutely stunning
Granted, the other tables are not as beautiful, but the view is still fantastic
I was not crazy about the appetizers
Both the Peking duck and the garlic lobster dumplings were acceptable but not outstanding
The entrees on the other hand were phenomenal

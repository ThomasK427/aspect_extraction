Thicken it up a bit
Friendly staff
Young crowd
Cool joint
I'd go back
Save room for that dessert
The pecan pie looked good
Delicious food; Chic; great for a date; not too pricey
What more can you ask for?
Working in the area, we are not at a loss for good restaurants
Kitchen 22, however, delivers all the chic and good food you expect at neighboring expensive restaurants with an affordable prix fixe menu
At $25 for a three-course meal that includes well-portioned, varied appetizers, a decent entree selction like the flavorful roasted chicken with creamy risotto, and simple but good desserts (get the chocolate decadence)
you can't lose
Get there early, though, because they don't take reservations and the 'cozy' dining area can sometimes demand up to an hour wait at the cramped bar
Delicious food for a great price
The only negative is that there are still a few Alva regulars still hanging around and giving this place bad reviews only because their old hang out is gone
I say good riddence
The change here was for the better
In this economy, Kitchen22 is someplace I'll be visiting again
You feel like you're getting a real night out--3 courses in a stylish + modern yet cozy space--and (hopefully) you get to walk out with something left in your wallet
I've been there several times and although service was a bit slow when it first opened, recently it has been prompt and friendly
My faves are the tuna appetizer and roasted chicken/risotto entree (if they're still on the menu--some dishes change frequently)
Be ready to have a cocktail while you're waiting for your table
We got there early on a Sat
nite and had a fantastic meal for an unbelievable price
The interior was cozy and unique with no pretense
The service and wine steward were impressive as well
The ONLY drawback was the no-reservations policy that makes going anytime after 6:30pm a surefire way to wait for over an hour for dinner
Well a few anyway
I went there with a couple of friends
Really friendly staff who were very knowledgeable about the (admittedly limited) menu
Great atmosphere even on wet and cold Tuesday night
But most of all, I can think of very few places in NYC where you can get such great cooking for such a great price
I went to Kitchen 22 with three friends
There are only a few choices as it is a price fixed menu, but each one of us ordered something different, and everyone's food was terrific
At $25, it is a great value for the quality, especially considering the price of other meals in that neighborhood
Before taking in a movie, a friend and I dined early at Kitchen 22 last Saturday evening
Although it was miserable out, K22 offered a great refuge from the rain and wind
The ambience was warm and cozy and the decor reminded me of my mom's living room circa 1967
The $25 3-course prix fixe was also a show-stopper, with lots of choices of appetizers, entrees and desserts so everyone's happy
I had the very rare tuna w/quail eggs and the oh-so-comforting roast chicken with risotto; my companion enjoyed the plentiful beet salad and Spanish mackerel w/chorizo - an interesting combo that worked
Stay away from the poached pear with mystery spices and cozy up to the flourless chocolate cake - yum
Can't wait to go back for more
Our only complaint our waiter was a bit of a lame-O
I'll admit, the bar at Kitchen 22 is a bit jammed
To remedy the situation, simply grab a drink and enjoy yourself
after all you ARE out to eat, drink, and be social
Once you do get seated the room is pleasant and the food is fantastic
the prices? they are what brought you here in the first place
that's good!
I don't know what all the bad reviews are about
Friends and I had dinner here last night and it was very good
Friendly waitstaff, delicious food, and the $25 prix fixe menu was great!
People hate change generally but the redsign and launch of Kitchen22 from Alva is the reason why people hate change
From being a great neighbourhood bar to, frankly, a hellhole
A long time regular I have had enough of being loyal to this place and although Richie makes the best Martini around, it's time to move on and find somewhere where it's not just about shifting units
If I could buy the place and convert it back I would and get rid of all the 1 glass of wine an hour amateurs and old crusties looking for a cheap feed
The much vaunted menu is average at best too
Alva farewell, Kitchen 22 goodbye
My friend and I walked in to an over crowded bar and were warned of a 45 minute wait
Thank god it turned out to be 15, as we were surrounded by chain smoking pseudo-fashionistas and the CSFB bankers who love them
The food was good (and the $25 prix fixe made it all that much better), but the dinner started to feel like an assembly line when our appetizer arrived 5 minutes after ordering
Kitchen 22's name should be replaced with Hell 22
The hostess was the most miserable person I have ever encountered in the restaurant business
My friends and I complained to the manager about the poor treatment
He proceeded to only argue back with us to defend his miserable hostess and was not accommodating in the least
This is not the way to be treated in a service industry
We will never come back
Alva used to be one of my favorite places in the neighborhood
The best burger around and anawesome staff with a great manager
But now Kitchen 22 is just like all the other crap on Park Ave South
Too high concept, too much of a scene and impossible to get a table
I'm sure the food is ok, but it's just not the same
good food, nice vibe
it's a good place to have a chill meal
not sceney, not glam
it just is
and it is great for what it is
re alva: bars and restaurants come and go, that's life
Alva was unique in the neighborhood -- a great dark bar with friendly bartenders, fantastic bar food (free at happy hour!!) and a good restaurant in the back with a laid-back and friendly vibe
Why they had to change it to Kitchen22 is beyond me
its now just like dozens of other places without any character
The food is ok, but not the value it seems
you can get a great appetizer and main course at nearby Punch for around that much
AND WHY DOES A PLACE WITH ONLY FOUR DISHES ON THE MENU TAKE 45 MINUTES TO BRING THEM OUT? And what the heck is up with those stupid globes on the bar?
Each month my friends and I look forward to choosing a different restaurant to meet and catch up
Regretfully, this month's choice was Kitchen 22
Although the food, ambience and waiter were fair the experience was all over shadowed by the obnoxious treatment we received by the hostess and manager
After consuming our meal and paying the check, we felt management should know of the rude behavior we experienced by the hostess
It turned comical when the manager, Paul, defended her instead of offering a smile, an apology or maybe even a thank you for still dining with them
Clearly, either of them have no understanding to the value of good customer service
Kitchen 22 is not worthy of the patronage! This one is a pass
Our experience at Kitchen 22 was less than satisfactory last night
The hostess was rude and unaccommodating
The horror continued with the managers unconcerned attitude toward our complaint
He offered no apology and trivialized our mistreatment by the hostess
I do NOT recommend Kitchen 22 to anybody who wants a pleasant dining experience
My friends and I ate here last night and had a very unpleasant experience
We were poorly treated by the hostess and when we brought our complaints to the manager's attention, he dismissed them without offering any apologies
The food was only adequate, the atmosphere was somewhat claustrophobic and the management was rude

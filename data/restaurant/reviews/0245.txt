the fresh pasta can be over cooked - linguine is broken down into shreds
shrimp and calamari one time is cooked tender, another overcooked and tough
the manager will be very defensive and tell you the chef, his brother, has not changed in 4 years
in that case perhaps there is a bigger problem here which is inconsistency
Two years ago, Amici was one of my favorite restaurants
Not too expensive, good wine, very nice atmosphere and delicious food
At some point the quality fell off
The tiramisu, which used to be delectable, started tasting like it was from the grocery store
The pastas became bland
Service became a little sloppier
It wasn't the Amici that we once knew
As an Astorian, Amici is so convenient that I'd almost pay them to get back to where they were
It's just not as good anymore
Definitely a must try
This hidden spot deserves a try
The food and service is definitely a city quality in astoria
The ambience is great if you're trying to impress your girlfriend or lover
They have a room that will take your breath away
But if you have to experience it for yourself
You definitely will not regret it
So many great things to say
To begin with, the ambience is excellent: totally not what you'd expect from Queens
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Queens
Queens has the best restaurants when it comes to food, but not necessarily for ambience
Amici, however, is a class act all the way
The ambience is great
I think the fact that this place is outside of Manhattan, and in such an unassuming location: tucked away around the corner from the N train, it feels much more relaxing than most places
The food is excellent, of course
Not your typical run-of-the-mill types, but unmistakeabley Italian nonetheless
The service is kind of hard for me to rate
The first time I went there it was very good
The second time I went there was new year's eve and everything took FOREVER
Anyways, definitely go to Amici
If you didn't try it you should
Outstanding food great service and atmosphere
You will love it
I think the previous reviewer should broaden his horizons beyond his Manhattan apartment and realize that Astoria is not all diner food
Believe it or not there IS culture over the 59th street bridge
As far as Amici Amore is concerned it is a great reason to come visit us here in Astoria
Excellent food, excellent service, cozy, romantic atmosphere, and a fantastic wine selection
Try the black linguine with shrimp or the sundried tomato ravioli
Both will make you smile from ear to ear
Their risottos are simply delicious; I never know which I like better
It's a great place whether you live a block away or fifty, it's definitely worth the trip
I must admit that when my friend said we were going to Astoria for dinner, I expected a diner sytle restaurant, where the decor, food and service would not suffice
However, when we got to the place, we had experienced dining at its best
The service was excellent
Our waiter was kind and made us feel like we were the guests of honor
He was also very knowledgable about there wines, which was quite extensive, including wines from all over the world
We chose the Exelsus wine, which went great with our meal and the food was exceptional
A must try was the tiramisu, which after a big dinner, went great because it was a very light dessert and extremely tasteful
When the check came, I was surprised that it didnt cost nearly as much as we expected to pay for the quality of the food and wine
Amici Amore is one of the best restaurants, that i have ever been to
When you first walk in you are greated be a very sweet and lovely hostess, which with no wait, will seat you to a table in which you desire
They have about over 1000's of wine to choose from, each and everyone looks tempting to taste
The food is great
That night i had the Red Snapper, which was excellent
I never liked seafood before, but when i saw how great the presentation was, i was like let me have that
that was the first time i ever had eaten seafood and let me tell you it was great!!!!!!!
To be honest when i first walked in Amici Amore 1 i was amazed the first thing that happened was that my mouth dropped, and WOW came out
When i layed eyes on this restauant, it was amazing especially that they opened up a Wine Vault
If you ever get a chance to get out to Astoria, Queens you should stop in, and have a look at what they did with the place
Over 5,000 cases of wine on a wall, you have about 1,000 wines hanging from the ceiling
Ive never been that excited to be in a restaurant before
Its and original
Besides the way the restaurant looks, the food is great, from the amore salad to the Sun dried tomato ravioli, to the Osso Buco
Everything was great, the people there were very nice, and the service was excellent
You dont find that in many places
I have to be honest, dining in Astoria I wasn't expecting much but, walking into this restaurant change my way of thinking
They offered hospitality that I will remember for a long time
They made us feel like the world revalved around us
We feel like we should be there ambasadors
Everything we had from amore salad to sun dried tomato ravioli, rib eye steak and mommas tiramisu was splended
There wine list was exceptional and when they presented us with a check we thought that we did not pay for half of the stuff we ordered
They were so reasonably priced
This nice, cozy italian place, has a peaceful atmosphere, that when you go there you feel at home
The food is excellent, the service is great, people there are extremely pleasant
The Scene Vivid ochre walls and homey touches give a rustic feel to the narrow, low-ceilinged dining room
The somewhat cramped tables are filled by a vivacious business clientele; servers linger, chat and make recommendations, but also commit sophomoric oversights
The Food The menu is chic Tuscan, utilizing local ingredients
Flavors are potent and broad, and the kitchen doesn't shy away from salt and oil
Pork is put to good use, in both an inventive salad of scrambled eggs and pancetta tossed with greens, and the chewy, salty "butcher's spaghetti" with pork ragu
Rare imported beans, like the big creamy varieties comprising a seven-bean salad, are a highlight
The kitchen has a sure hand with fish: Monkfish wrapped in prosciutto over escarole is quite nice, and a gentle braise amid vegetables does wonders for branzino
"Tuscan cowboy-style" ribs, braised with tomato, garlic and salt, are tender and packed with flavor
Great service , we were seated right away
The food was different and very good
'You must try the fries!!! All the soups were great
On our second anniversary, my husband and I chose Beppe for its rustic and comforting qualities
The outside of the restaurant creates a warm and inviting feeling
Pleasantly greeted by the smoky air, red and goden light, and an unpretentious host, seating was quick and easy - you really can't go wrong anywhere
Our waiter was exceptional
Able to recommend when asked, yet not overbearing in any way
Handsome
We had an appetizer and entrees
The food was fantastic
I am still thinking about it today
I had a white fish, orata? It was just the most amazing, relaxed, unpretentious, warm and classy dinner
I loved every second of it and would not hesitate to recommend this place not only to couples, but for anyone looking for a quick escape out of elbow rubbing NYC to a night of something Tuscan
From the start to finish

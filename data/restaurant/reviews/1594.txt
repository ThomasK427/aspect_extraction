Frank is consistently great! The salmon with arugula was prepared just right! The communal table is fun for groups as well!
I have always wanted to eat here after hearing nothing but positive reviews about this restaurant
I can honestly say that I was very impressed! Every dish was better than the next and I would definitely recommend this to friends
One of NYC's many tired Japanese restaurants that have overstayed their welcome
Sushi wasn't too good but the wasabi was strangely inedible
It's the best Sushi in the Gramercy/Union Square area, and I think among the best in Manhattan
Yama gets the lines, but if you want great sushi, to be seated quickly (outside if you're lucky), and a reasonable bill, then Choshi's the place
Still my favorite Japanese/sushi place in New York
It may not be fancy but I love it
I dream about the dragon rolls (better than Blue Ribbon) and the spicy tuna roll is also very good
It's a neighborhood place that is a great value so don't expect super attentive service or a dreamy ambience
Just go for the food and enjoy
I had the most delicious eel avocado wrapped in cucumber and amazing spicy rolls! The service was a bit slow, but the food was truly great and a very good value
I'm convinced it's the best sushi in the neighborhood
When we went there on Sunday around 4:00P
M
, there was no problem with their service
It was just freezing to seat next to the window
We had Sushi Lunch Special but it was not what we expected
They were just like miniature sushi for dolls
They were tiny and looked cute
Obviously not for Japanese people
:) Once is enough for us
Not only sushi but they have nice food from kitchen
Like Udon noodle Nabeyaki is the best
I stumbled upon Choshi a few months ago and it has been a staple ever since
My friends and I have made a Sunday tradition out of their amazingly inventive rolls (tuna kinuta and golden's are unbelievable) and fresh fish
I used to frequent Yama a couple times a week and now Choshi it is
Service is sllllllow but friendly and a meal there is worth the wait!
I'm very surprised that Citysearch doesn't highlight this place, and the reviews were so negative
It is small, and the service isn't great
BUt the sushi is good
If you're in the neighborhood, and don't mind waiting 15 minutes or so
this is a great place
Not too expensive, and they serve yummy cooked food for those not loving the RAW stuff
They are the only place that makes spicy tuna/yellowtail rolls without Mayo, yummmy yummy eel pieces
A great dragon roll
They deliver, so they are very fast at preparing it and don't need you lingering for a long time
So for a quick neighboorhood sushi spot - this place can't be beat!
Zagat said it best with you're better off not seeing the interior, so savor your sushi alfresco at a sidewalk table
Choshi's rolls were tasty and reasonably priced ($3 to $8) and the service was prompt
Although I wouldn't go back, I would HIGHLY recommend the Tempura ice cream for dessert - fried green tea ice cream with a red bean sauce on top - OUT OF THIS WORLD and only $5
If it weren't for that dessert and our outside table, I would have left extremely disappointed
They have never done me wrong
I love the dragon roll and basically only eat Maguro (tuna) and they prepare well
I've had better and more imaginative sushi but if I'm in the GramPark area I will stop in for a bite
Although I have only been here twice, both visits were pleasant
The food is scrumptious (artichoke pasta dish) and the service was decent
If I could have only one restaurant then Cafe Centosette would be it
Since I lived a block away from their original location at 107 (thus Centosette) 3rd Ave
, I have been in love with this restaurant
When they closed shop (to move) I went into mourning
Joyously, I rediscovered them a few blocks away on 2nd Ave
at 10th St
Especially good are their Penne Arrabiata (Arrabiata = angry for the spiciness) and Fettuccine Primavera
Even better is the special order they have made for me for years
Fettuccine Primavera
Arrabiata with the spice of the Arrabiata and the succulent julienned vegetables of the Primavera
I always saw people in this little glass-walled customer magnet, so I decided to try it with a friend
I thought, to quote Woody Allen, The food was terrible, and such small portions! Seriously, why pay these prices for run-of-the-mill Italian food you could easily whip up yourself in a few minutes? I left feeling unsatisfied, except for having a nice chance to people watch in the cozy atmosphere with my over-priced pasta bolognese
this place is quite nice
Nice lighting in the place, enough space for the table and distance away from the next person
They let you relax and watch the 2nd ave crowd walk by
Food was just alright though
My veg's in the pasta were a little raw and the lasana seemed to cooked on the top as it collapsed when you cut it
All in all, I'd go back
on a plus note, this place knows how to make a martini! There are a number of different kinds
I don't know where anyone got the impression cafe centosette is Italian
it is definitely suppose to resemble a French bistro
Anyway I live right near Cafe Centosette and it's one of my favorite places to go for lunch on a Sunday afternoon
The food is excellent, and there is a rather extensive selection for all types of people (I am a vegetarian and there are quite a few things on there for me
) The stuffed artichokes are amazing
The service leaves a lot to be desired, they always only have two waitresses on for the whole restaurant
Getting your bill is tough due to the lack of staff, and the French mentality of bringing the bill before you request it, but ifyou have some time to spare, defintely try it out
The bread they put onto the table was bit into
The service was terrible and unfriendly
I felt rushed and unwelcomed
The food was so salty and unprofessionally prepared
I used to enjoy this restaurant, but lately they have been gonig downhill
I won't go back again
I live in the area and Cafe Centosette is one of my favorite stand-bys
The food is an excellent value for the money! Portion sizes aren't huge, but you don't leave feeling bloated and overfilled
Try the Penne a la Montarosa
If this is the diner I think it is, it's a really cool place that's open 24/7
Their hot cocoa was on point and the hamburgers are awesome! Great atmosphere and great prices
what more could you ask for?
Went here with a friend for Sunday evening dinner
After finishing our beers and appetizers, it became clear that the lone sushi chef had not even started making our orders, and appeared to be making take-out orders before ours
The restaurant had just one waiter serving the entire restaurant, and other customers looked increasingly impatient, as we were
We walked out after canceling or main orders -there's no need to put up with such slow service in an area that's full of food options
Also, there was a rather unpleasant smell of Pine-sol or similar disinfectant lingering inside -not very appetizing
Goto nearby Yama or even Choshi instead
not too many sushi places in the area, and found this one to one of the better ones
nothing special tho, just good food without being over rated
service slow, and a tad rude
flatiron needs better sushi!!!
I have been going to Hamachi for about 6 years Mae Ling is absoutely wonderful and always makes you feel welcome to her establishment
It's not glitzy or anything, but they have such an amazing variety of rolls that you'd likely never think of ordering and it's always perfectly fresh and the people couldn't possibly be nicer
Much better than going to Mizu
We love going here

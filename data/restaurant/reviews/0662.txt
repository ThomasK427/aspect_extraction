Organic sandwiches and panini's not only catered to vegetarians
Staff is friendly
Best of all
they have COMPLIMENTARY DSL access but you got to bring your own laptop
Posh decor with comfy Eames chairs and Saranin tables
Great people watching place, I saw celeb's like Helen Hunt, Claire Danes, Sandra Burnhart there
There should be more of these in the city
A true Starbucks alternative
Atmosphere is bright and clean
Food can be a bit bland
Everything is with soy
The Scene The story behind this tiny, triangular cafe was captured in "Eat This New York," a documentary honored at the 2002 Hamptons International Film Festival
Just when its proprietors doubted that Moto would make it, the restaurant ground into gear like a Vincent Black Shadow, beneath the tracks of the elevated J and M trains
The Food Heavily barred windows enclose a comfort zone for artsy locals who crave a taste of the trendier end of town in this low-rent sector
Sample the beer and wine list, but don't miss the food
The inexpensive paninis, made with crusty bread and fine Italian fixings such as sopressata and portobello mushrooms, are worth the trek, and the grilled doughnuts, sweet, warm and indulgent, put Krispy Kreme to shame
Moto is a charming place, romantic, rustic, and right under the subway
It also helps that it is in South Williamsburg and not Williamsburg proper
Still, it left me wanting more
The waitress had little knowledge of the wine but made up for it, somewhat, by offering me two samples of white, neither were particularly good
As for the food, the artichoke served with mayo was excellent and the eggs with anchovies were nice
I was very excited for my entree, pork ribs with herbs de provence, sadly the meat was tough and the salad bland
My partner ordered the chicken and I wish I would have done the same
For dessert we shared the grilled doughnuts which were great, but would have been sublime with a touch of creme fraiche and a sprig of mint
and I don't just mean to this slightly out-of-the-way locale
That's all relative
What I mean is, if you like to be transported to another world than MOTO is just the place to go
I discovered it by accidental intension while cycling down broadway late last summer
The interior design and sensibility brought to mind a futuristic apocolypic French film set, which is what the motorcycle repair owners apparently intended
One of these owners, clad in a Ramones t-shirt, sat down with me for five minutes and discussed his motives
The menu, by contrast is less elaborate, but no less enticing
The roasted chicken with rosemary mash pototoes are perfect on a cold weekend after Thanksgiving
The final touch was the live music, offered nightly
The discovery of Jems like MOTO are what make New York such a wonderful city to live in
Moto is fantastic, the space is warm and inviting and meticulously detailed
Live music every night I think (jazz, bluegrass) and good service
Generally a very welcoming attmosphere
The food is great (artichoke) and prices reasonable
Just what the southside ordered
This place is fantastic!! It was recommeded to us by the bartender down the street at Boogaloo
Great food, great service, and a great, though tiny, space
Been twice with friends and they were equally impressed
Simple menu, interesting decor and deliciously prepared lite fare make this place an excellent find
Tucked under the JMZ at the Hewes Stop this little triangular french bistro (Okalahoma meets Berlin?) is really great
Service was pretty good too (save for one of the waitresses who seemed a little stuck-up for no reason and more interested in her nails/hair/telephone than her clients)
It's cozy and intricately decorated a la left bank 1920's
Everything we had was superb
good, simple and hearty food for a good value
can't beat the atmosphere: oklahoma city meets berlin
highly recommended!
I took 8 friends out to Moto a few weeks back--all from Manhattan
At first it took some convincing to get them to venture out to Brooklyn
Since that night, all have returned with their friends
This place is great and has atmosphere not found anywhere else
Attention was paid to every detail when making this place
The best part is that it's at the foot of the subway stairs one stop into Brooklyn
It's closer that a lot of bars I go to in Manhattan
Have Fun
The Scene In a neighborhood where restaurants are as painstakingly hip as the locals, Sparky's dares to be cute--and succeeds
Sure, there's peeling paint and punk-rock background music, but the small room (decorated with retro lockers and cartoonish paintings) is lit up like a gymnasium, and counter service comes with a smile
Couples with kids cram the few picnic tables; late night brings bar hopping locals
The Food Dot
com dropout-turned-frankfurter aficionado Brian Benevidez stuffs Niman Ranch's hickory-smoked, hormone- and antibiotic-free beef dogs into oversized fresh-baked buns with insanely good homemade condiments, such as cubed pickle-chili relish and molasses mustard, for just a couple of bucks
All eleven top-heavy options burst with flavor, but the Sparky's Dog--topped with 17-spice chili, gooey Grafton cheddar and thick-cut crispy bacon--is a meal itself
The few additional offerings, like generous tangles of hand-cut skin-on fries, ultra-creamy Ronnybrook milk shakes, macaroni and cheese and full-flavored burgers, will delight your inner child
Now, I am not very picky
but the food and service I received here was horrible! We ordered our food (which was expensive) and sat down (at a dirty table with glasses and napkins from the previous diners still on it) to wait for the food
About a half an hour later (how on earth can it take a half an hour to make a blt, milkshake, grilled cheese sandwich, and two orders of fries?) the waitress/cashier delivered the food to our table
The blt was burnt cold toast with old lettuce, one slice of tomato, and some burnt bacon
My friend went to the counter and asked them to make another one, and they put it in the microwave and gave it back to her
Who microwaves lettuce!? My grilled cheese was AWFUL
The cheese was bad
The bread was rock hard
They used a whole stick of butter on my one little grilled cheese sandwich
The strawberry shake seemed more like vanilla extract with milk and ice
The only good thing was the french fries, and the refund! Hopefully they get it together because the place could be great with some decent management and cooks

I have never had a better burger and the fact that it is organic? Just more mustard for the bread
Also, the fries (especially the chili cheese fries) are incredible
i love this place
the cheese fries are so good and the hot dogs are awesome
great, well-priced comfort food
and they deliver to greenpoint!
I'm totally addicted to the burger box
It tastes homemade, but I cannot for the life of me recreate this at home
I don't know how they do it, but I don't feel that nasty burger/fries what have I done bloat after eating it
It's probably just using good quality fresh ingredients, and that they make every thing there, right down to the catsup
Only six bucks!! Beyond the food, the atmosphere feels very Williamsburg to me, with the wild music, hipster staff, industrial space, retro menu and eclectic decor
I order from Sparky's when I'm looking for a passable hot dog or burger (and it is just that - passable) for delivery
The last three times I've called (in addition to asking me to wait for a long time before taking my order), they've given me grief about asking for delivery even though my address is clearly within the map printed on the menu, just because the delivery guy gets mad if he has to go out of his way

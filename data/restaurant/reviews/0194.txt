I go for the highly imaginative sushi creations, which you can't find elsewhere
The ambiance is fun, the people are lively, and it's a place to meet and be met! What's not to like?
The sushi here was definitely good, but it was certainly not worth the price
Downtown, upstairs on a Saturday night is lots of fun
Music, outdoors, feels like a mini-getaway
Great sushi too, very fresh!!
We've been to SS7 twice and had a great time - both times
First time one of my friends knew the host and we got a primo table, treated especially well, and free drinks
The second time was standard NYC - we were anonymous but the mojitos helped us through
The place is OK
too much hype about Sushie Samba 7
I went to Sushi Samba 7 last night and it was good
Just good
Not great
The food was tasty and creative, the mojitos were made correctly
but I still wasn't blown away
The interior is starting to look shabby - one of our chairs really needed a scrubbing and a chair near us was peeling
I recommend it for the food, but for the cost, I would expect higher quality
Sushi Samba 7 is definitely one of the hottest places in the city
Although there is a $50 p/p min, the top patio roof is incredible and worth it
The food is delicious and they make their drinks strong
Cerviche, scallop appetizer, soft shell crab roll, the chilean sea bass
everything just melts in your mouth here
Bring your friends and lots of $$$ for a guaranteed blast
I love this place
We've even been to the one in Miami and it is always great
The drinks are especially good and you will always be satisfied
I think this is a good place to start if you have never had sushi like my fiance who now loves it
I went their with my husband and it is wonderful
The Seviche and Sushi is GREAT!Try it
The food very fresh and creative --and the decor and atmosphere is both fun and comfortable too
Great place for a date, small group or large group
Highly recommend it
The food is great
I had a Gaucho , beef with sweet platains , it was so exotic
The music is great
They play a lot of samba
This place is a bit expensive but it's wirth it
All i can say about this place is mmmmmm!
The grand total for this charmless act of malfeasance was $1,000
Sushi Samba 7 reminds me of the places that sprang up durning the economic boom--bad, pretentious, and grossly overpriced
No deck is worth bearing the restaurant on which it sits
Great place to go with a group
The food is great and it is always packed in the summer
Everything about SS is great
so great that on 2 occasions 4 of us waited up to an hour after our reservation time to be seated
I know, I know, comes with the territory
The good news is their response was to buy us a round on our way out, which we promptly spilled b/c we had been drinking for 3 hours at that point
Went there with a couple of girlfriends for a bday celebration and i have to say the rooftop is absolutely amazing! Feels like you're on vacation up there w/ delish sushi and mojitos
waiter was very attentative to our needs- excellent service
Sushi Samba
Japanses food with a Spanish twist
You can't get more hip than that
The ambience is superb and the food is beyond declicious
If your date can't appreciate this, I will say she/he is not the right person for you
Also a great place to spot models and just have pure fun with your friends
Only downside: bring a lot of cash
The rooftop at Sushi Samba is excellent so was the bartender
The mojitos and the strawberry martinis are to die for
And the food never disappoints
The mohitos are excellent and the sushi is good, but the service is somewhat slow
Overall I truly enjoy eating here, particularly upstairs where the ambiance is warmly exuberant and very comfortable
The Scene The road from casual cheese enthusiast to fromage junkie is short, and a visit to Artisanal, the latest offering from Picholine chef Terrance Brennan, will speed the trip
The smell alone, a heady lattice of 200 perfectly humidified, pristinely fresh artisanal cheeses, may induce you to take the first step toward such fanaticism
The familiar brasserie design is appealing, with a fromagerie station in back that slices cheese to go
The Food But it would be wrong to judge Artisanal for its cheese alone
A basket of gougeres, instantly addictive baked Gruyere puffs, is a mandatory opener, but the non-cheese-based entrees are every bit as good: tuna carpaccio with sea salt and a jazzy dice of vegetables; superb falling-off-the-bone rabbit in mustardy spaetzle; crisp pig's trotters in truffled polenta
Though it serves food that might seem disarmingly humble, it's prepared in a way that's anything but
We had a girls' night dinner here for restaurant week
We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up ordering a la carte
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation
I'm also convinced our waiter was a zombie; he appeared to have difficulty focusing while we spoke to him
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience
We began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip
Be careful of portions - they're HUGE
I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer
I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries)
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin
Dinner, with wine, ended up costing around $130
not a bad deal when you consider how flavorful and large the portions are!
NO A/C
No apologies during restaurant week
No free drink
Butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere
A million better places to go in the city
Our evening at Artisanal more resembled dinner on a subway platform
The ambient temperature (inside) must have been in the mid to high 80's
The noise level is always pretty high, but combined with no A/C it was basically unbearable
Although the evening began well enough at the bar, the temperature steadily rose as our dinner reservation time approached
We should have taken the lead from other parties, who just got up and left
A hostess told us it was due to steam pipes in the floor (in July)
We learned the truth from other customers who escaped to the street: no air conditioning
A restaurant of this stature should have more respect for their customers
Last evening we may have had a fine dinner and excellent wine
However, any memories of the dinner have been overshadowed by the horrible conditions inside the restaurant and the deceptive explanation
I will not be returning to the A train
My first thought upon entering the dining room was Good God this place is loud
That feeling never deviated
Picture an elegantly set table in the exact middle of the main room of Grand Central Station
That's what dining at Artisanal is like

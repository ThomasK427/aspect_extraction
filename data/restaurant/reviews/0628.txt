The lobster sandwich is amazing! A must
Plus a nice wine list
nothing overly spectacular (after reading reviews and hearing things
)
Service was the only thing that stood out - everyone there was NICE, efficient and wonderful
The food was okay
nothing out of this world
We did, however, have a wonderful time (it was just good energy), but don't really understand what all the hype is
Good for crappy 2nd Avenue, I guess
The place was charming
Our waiter was fab
The food
I guess that's where we were less than thrilled
Just average
but a good place out when you don't feel like cookin'
atmosphere is not that relaxing, if you go - you MUST bring a cell phone and go down the street for a drink
because you will be waiting for at least an hour
but food is great and it's fun
although not built for the type of crowd it draws
a little cramped for my taste
I love this place
There has been a chef change but the food has not suffered as a result
The prices and ambience are great as well
This is one of the best places to eat in new york:)
The owners of Red Cat and the Harrison have done it again
A great, fresh food restaurant
While the no reservations policy is hard, the wait wasn't too bad and the service was friendly
The front room can get crowded, but we sat by the door on a cold evening and didn't ever feel the chill, nor did we feel pressed upon by the waiting patrons
Food is delicious and the wine is reasonable - a great list, too
The food is well prepared seafood in a delightful setting, good service and typical prices
Save room for the complimentary and wonderful pumpkin pudding
What a charming restaurant
We went on a Monday night around 6:30pm and were seated right away in the backroom, which is dimly-lit, casual, cozy--kind of felt like you were sitting in a spacious dining galley of a ship or a cabin
The food was great
Definitely try the fried oysters; the tomato butter is heavenly
I've had the lobster rolls at Pearl's and Mary's, and I thought the one here was a little smaller, but just as tasty (though at $22 slightly expensive)
The bay fries are terrific--crisp and slim and slightly seasoned, and the pumpkin pudding we had at the end was just the right finish
Good service, decent prices
I'd come back
Mermaid Inn is a very good restaurant in the East Village
We've been there a few times already
One time we sat outside and it was lovely, very different from the inside where it can get a bit noisy
Service is terrific and very reliable
Food is very good
best lobster roll we've had in a long time
Wines are also very good
We will be back
Don't be afraid of the no reservation policy
We give them our cell #, have a drink at Ike's or Global 33 (across the st) and then we get a call
Although I did not care for my skate main dish, the appetizers were satisfying and the oysters are a solid choice
Also, the wine is relatively inexpensive and the list offers many good selections
This place is ok, but nothing special
i went there on wed night with my girl friend
we got there not so late around 7pm, so wasn't crowded
we got seated very promptly
but i heard it's very busy on weekends
reservation can be made in advance if it is more than 6 ppl
we ordered fried sardine salad, seafood pasta and salmon filet
everything was so good
white wine we ordered was great as well
and we got complimentary mini chocolate moose after the dinner, which was a good surprise for us
The lobster sandwich offered by the Mermaid Inn is not NEARLY as good as those offered by Pearl Oyster Bar or Mary's Fish Camp
Overall, I thought the food was OK, at best
The complimentary pudding at the conclusion of the meal is good, sans that gross pudding skin on the top
Looking for a great seafood place to end the perfect summer day? Mermaid Inn is definitely the place
Even though the bustling of people outside waiting for tables indicated a sure wait, we knew wed hit on something great
A very pleasant hostess took my name and cell number and told me she'd call (wow, very rare in nyc) once they had a table ready
Seated much quicker than expected, the place had the comfortable feel of a small, New England fishing town and fresh food to match
The staff was great, and the food was even better
Dont miss the scallops, grilled salmon that was done to perfection, and the best tomato salad Ive ever had
Even the music being pumped out of the stereo was just right
If youre in the mood for a fun, fresh seafood place without any overdone nyc glitz, this place cant be beat
I LOVE this place
I took my friends here and it was perfect
We had a short wait at the bar which was fun because the bartenders were friendly
The food was great
The oysters and clams were amazing and at the end the tab was cheap and it came with a fortune fish
Who could ask for anything more?
We were a group of 3 people and as expected, we waited about an hour before we were sitted which I didn't mind
We then had to wait another 45 min
for our entree
I was dying of hunger!! Service was alright and food was pretty good too
Their little complimentary desserts were cute and thoughtful
Limited menu but they all sounded good and interesting
It was as expected; the price and quality of food
I would go back if I didn't have to wait 2 hours for the meal
Finally, a moderately priced quality fish joint in Manhattan
Clam fritters rock, but I think the arctic char tartare with celery root crisps is the best appetizer
While grilled dourade is a fantastic entree, but when did we Americans start calling common sea breem or porgy by its more tasty-sounding French name? I also like the salmon with spicy corn salad
Couple anything with the very generously poured white bordeaux
Oh, and those Old Bay fries
Mmmmmmmmmmmm
You better hover by the bar, grab a seat and eat there - the bartender is very service-friendly - or else count on a long wait
As if the 2 hour wait wasn't bad enough, the host/manager was so busy flirting with attractive female customers, he didn't seem to notice we had been sitting at the bar and we ended up missing his call
The food was decent and the staff was nice but the gentleman and the door left such a bad taste in our mouths that we would never return
My husband and I were pretty excited to try out this new place
The atmosphere was charming and cozy and we were happy UNTIL we tried the food
The crab and spinich dip was a milky bland concoction with VERY few pieces of crabmeat -Complete disappointment
Second appetizer we tried was the clam fritters - mediocre
My main dish was the highly recommended diver scallops which consisted of 4 quarter sized scallops surrounding a mound of bland cooked spiced cabbage - for $18 I could have cooked up a better dish with groceries from Citerella

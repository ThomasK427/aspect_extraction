If I'm paying 15 dollars for two tacos I expect some salsa or gauc to be included
The staff was a little rude
Too bad because the place is cute and I love my mexican
I've got a new neighborhood favorite! This place has the best margaritas and tacos
I've been back twice since
the service is friendly and quick
and the ambiance is great I felt like I was in Rosa Rita Mexico, except here it was clean and I could drink the water! I definately recomend this place for a fun date or a party with a few friends
From the moment we arrived, we could tell we were going to have fun
The decor is so playful, and the seating is intimate
The tall seats at the center communal table were ideal, perfect even for a pregnant woman to travel often to and from the table (if you know what I mean)
The margaritas were great, the guacamole was nicely dense with the crisp tortillas chips and the soft tacos were excellent--the carnita with pineapple, grilled talapia, tuna and CHORIZO, each was yummy! Chocolate taco for dessert was perfect to share
We went with managed expectations and had a great time!
I come from the home of Tex-Mex cooking, so my standards for Mexican food are very high
The food here is fresh and good, but I wouldn't say spectacular
What makes it worth its while is the fantastic Blood Orange Margarita which is honestly the best I have ever had - New York and Texas combined! Come here late for some drinks, guacamole, fresh chips, and a taco or two
A couple of weeks ago a friend and I were seated at a table along the wall; bench on one side, chair on the other
As people began to sit on either side of us I realized I was sitting right on the middle of where two benches met and was constantly getting pinched throughout dinner
As if that wasn't fun enough, the second our plates were cleared the waitress put our bill down to return 5 minutes later and ask us to pay because she was leaving
Something I expect to hear in a diner but not a restaurant
5 minutes later the same waitress came back to have us move to the next table so she could seat a party of 4
RUDE! Her excuse was It's Saturday, you know
It's obvious they are only interested in how quickly they can turn tables, not if anyone ever returns
If you want to pay $8 for a (1) toritilla the size of your palm, with three small pieces of cold, fatty steak, than this is the place for you
God forbid you get any of the normal accompaniments that normally come with a taco
If you do, you're looking at a below-average $12 taco
Oh, and the service is terrible
This restaurant just opened this summer, and I've already been there twice
Both times, the food was fantastic
Creative tacos (you mix and match) and other Mexican fare
Unlike most Mexican restaurants in the city, everything tastes freshly made
Among the best guacamole's I've tasted
served with warmed fresh chips
good margaritas
Service was a bit more spotty
the busboys were fantastic -- very attentive when it came to replenishing chips, removing dishes, but I have to say the waitress service was not quite as good
Always pleasant when you find them, but I had a hard time finding the waitress and waving her over on both occasions
I'd say if they would add one more waitress to the staff, the place would be near perfect
I should have known by the 666 t-shirts worn by the waiters that i was in for trouble
But against my better judgment, I entered - seduced by the pedigree of the chef
This place was blatantly more concerned about maximizing profit than they were about my dining experience
First, my wife I were greeted with the restaurant groundrules: $15 minimum per person if you want to eat at a table
Otherwise, you can eat at the bar (It was Saturday afternoon and the place was empty)
Bending the rules for us, we were granted one of their tables
However, the owner asked that we both squeeze into an area barely large enough for one
During our meal there were several more examples indicative of the same edict - maximize profit!  I guess it's just the price you pay for being tempted by the devil and his theme restaurant
I can't count the times my wife and I have taken friends over for lunch or dinner
So far there has not been a day where the food wasn't amazing
Many reviews speak of lousy service and an overcrowded room and they are right
I am deeply tempted to comment it directly to the owner who acts as a waiter and host most times
(He is the only white man on the floor)
His wife is the chef and the place is ran by a small crew of people
However, the food is one I can't get over and for which I'll always be back
The ceviche is fresh and of good quality
Their shrimp causa and papa rellena are to die for
Their lomo salteado is amazing if you still have any room for food left
Desserts are lacking and that is dissapointing
Their sangria is quite smooth but be careful, they sneak up on you
I've taken Peruvian friends over who said they havent had anything so close to home in years
Last month, my boyfriend and I went to Lima's Taste
I heard good things about it so we decided to check it out
Unfortunately, it was horrible from the start
The restaurant was stuffy
The server looked like he'd rather be somewhere else
The CD skipped for an hour before it was changed and then the music was turned up too loud
The server took our order about 20 minutes after we sat
Our appetizer took almost an hour to come out
We lost our appetites by the time the entrees were on our table because they took so long
I'm not sure why there was such a wait, considering that they were prepared half-heartedly and tasted horrible
The only thing I did like about this place was the sangria
And as much as I love my sangria, it's not enough to make me go back there ever again
I arrived to Lima's taste last weekend with out-of-town family and a friend who had lived in south america, and all were impressed by both meal quality and presentation
The ceviche was especially excellent- most notably the spicy tuna and the mixto appetizers- and the escaviche and lamb stew entrees were both impressive
It's a croweded little place, with not a lot to move around, but with excellent food, friendly service (which accounted for one of my family members' significant food allergy), and above-average sangria, I will be back again
I went this past weekend and I seated myself because there was no one at door
This past Memorial day weekend was hot and I asked the waiter why was the air condition not working and he responded doens't know why
The food was so so, I had better in some other hole in the wall place
Thumbs down for me
My cousin, who owns a restaurant, suggested we go to Lima's Taste on our first visit to NY
I couldn't have been more impressed - the food is divine, the owners are great, and the ambience is inviting
Try the Ceviche Mixto and a Pisco Sour
The sangria is fantastic, too
I will definitely return to this hidden hot spot!
Stranded in Greenwich Village on a Saturday night with hungry stomachs and no reservations, my boyfriend and I stopped into Lima's Taste
We each ordered the Escaveche - salmon and tuna
My tuna was firm, fresh and delicious
The sauce was spicy and vinegary, but in a good way
Yucca on the side topped it off
We noticed a group of Peruvians sitting next to us - always a good sign
Unfortunately, service was slow and when our server noticed we had not received our entree he comp'ed us two delightful margaritas - AND charged us only for appetizers , thereby cutting our bill in half
I will certainly return and gladly pay full price for such good food and sincere service!  A great place for a date (dark, Spanish vibe), children (saw lots of little ones chowing down) and groups (great Sangria pitchers and small plates
)
Walk down Christopher St and hit Bedford and you're sure to see a humorous msg on this restaurant's outdoor sign
Besides having an excellent, timely sense of humor, they serve super ceviche
The main dishes are decent, but you will be happier with the peruvian apps and ceviche dishes
In particular, try the ceviche caliente, ceviche mussels, papa rellena, and chicken causa
Part of the fun dining here is watching the parade of people wandering down the street, out for a night in the West Village
And most certainly, order a pitcher of the tasty Sangria
I had the absolute worst dining experience there
The menu says they charge a 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more
Fine

The waiter was funny, he kept us all amused
The appetizer came out cold and the waiter came and took it to the kitchen
They just heated it again in the oven
It has always been my experience that the food be totally recooked
When our meals came, my friend told the maitre de that his meal was cold
When he took it it, the maitre de said it is not cold
He did take it and have it reheated
However it was not acceptable for him to question my friend
The maitre de should have apologized and a new meal should have been cooked
I understand they were busy, but there was no excuse, esp since it was a fairly expensive meal
My family had dinner here during the Feast on Saturday evening and were more than impressed
Food and service were wonderful!
Can't understand the bad reviews
Food was great, service was great
The waiter even brought a free side salad when my wife couldn't decide which to get
Nice job with singing Happy Birthday as well
After an exciting trip to China Town, my friend and I made a terrible mistake when we unsuspectingly walked into Tai Hong Lau restaurant for a well deserved meal
Dim Sum was stale and the spring rolls were soggy
Fish, chicken and beef dishes were equally bad
Chinese beer Shindau was served warm and complaining to management did not produce any results
My complaint was ignored
The bill was $75 and I could not pay with my Visa credit card
Contrary to restaurant policy listed in City Search on the internet, I was told that the restaurant only accepts American Express credit cards or cash
After having to pay in cash and with a bad taste in my mouth, I walked out of the restaurant, never to return again
While in Chinatown walking around on a Saturday afternoon, we chose this place at random and they had a sign in the window Best Dim Sum
We went in, were seated promptly and immediately they started coming by with food
It was absolutely amazing
I would recommend this place to any and everyone who is looking for good dim sum
Try the steamed pork bun!
On one of our recent outings to Chinatown we stumbled across tai hong lau, since it was a Saturday we anticipated a long wait
It was a well deserved
The dim sum was fresh, delicious, and hot
Every dish we had was juicy and the best dim sum I had in a long long time
I recommend the shrimp dumpling pronounce har gow and pork dumpling su mai
The push carts were awesome and really helped to see all the different dishes they have
The service was friendly and efficient
The only thing is that dim sum ends at 3pm so I suggest getting there early
I am Chinese and was so excited when I found your restaurant with 3 of my friends
We stopped in for dim sum, which is one of my favorite meals! But unfortunately, they did not have much selection and the waitresses and waiters were rude and inattentive to us
After a long wait, they finally took our order, only to speak rudely about us in Chinese to the table behind us
We nearly left, but waited in anticipation of some good dim sum only to find out that the food was as poor a quality as the service
My dim sum was dry and crumbled at the touch of my chopstick
Not worth the long wait, aggravating service and high cost
Stay away, there are many other better options for dim sum in NY
On a whim my group and I decided to give Tai Hong Lau a try for Dim Sum since all the other popular restaurants were too packed
The service was rushed, non-attentive, and rude
The Dim Sum was nowhere near the quality in which we were used to (egg tarts were dry and cold, steamed pork buns were tough and stale, etc
) and they were charging $3
00 for a small dim sum place order! We'll stick with the other popular places, perhaps thats why its worth the wait
I was a bit lost in chinatown because there are so many restaraunts around but eventually I stumbled on this
The food is delicious, although some dishes are better than others (try the chicken w/peppers n peanuts-fabulous!)
Service was very good, the staff were very accomodating (to the point that they moved a table across the room so we wouldn't have to sit by the door!) and the prices were very reasonable
The restaraunt itself is a little bright which dampens the ambience a bit but all in all this is a decent example of what chinatown has to offer and I would certainly go back there
By far, the best-tasting dim sum I've had in NYC
The salty squid is delicious and the custard buns are heavenly
The service could improve, though
Sometimes, variety is lacking-- you watch the same items parade past you over and over again
On weekends, arrive before noon to avoid the crowd waiting to be seated
Hot trendy place turned Tribeca neighborhood spot for brunch, lunch and dinner, The Independent really surprised me when I returned after not going there for two years
The smoked babyback ribs with creamy cole slaw and roasted corn on the cob is one of the best in NYC (maybe the country!) and one of my guests had a confit of duck legs with roasted butternuts squash, garlic mashed potatoes and braised leeks which was out of this world
The oysters (served on the half shell or fried with cornmeal coating) are among the freshest I have ever had and my other guest had terrific tuna and salmon dishes which I could not keep my hands off
The small modern two story townhouse is an intimate setting and Helen Hunt was sitting at a dimly lit table in the corner (she lives two streets away)
What a place, what a find!
I found this restaurant on Citysearch and what a find it was
We don't get downtown very often, but, we'll be going back to The Independent again!
I took my wife to The Independent for her birthday and we were treated to very friendly service and very good food
I highly recommend The Independent!
This plaice is frequented by hibatchiboy
A good-time diner classic - complete with loud waiters who yell 'deluxe' and use traditional diner style ordering from the suisse chef
You can get eggs, loaded with a variety of toppings, heavily buttered toasts and italian wedding soups
Don't miss the really mean waitress who might yell at you if you take too long to order
The Scene Behind its modest entrance is a spare, but richly attractive restaurant, where muted colors, modern art and prestigious wine bottles adorn the somewhat elderly dining rooms
The luxury is understated, and the well-to-do clientele are casual in dress and behavior, but there's a hushed air even when the restaurant is full
Service is excellent
The Food The cuisine is French, but hardly traditional
A dose of curry enlivens mellow tuna tartare; tiny potatoes, favas and shiitakes provide a twist to luxurious salad of tender lobster claws
A scattering of meaty morels and firm snail chunks gives deliciously delicate crisp-fried frog legs earthy context
Melting braised beef shank, a slightly subpar steak au poivre and unctuous marrow-and-oxtail custard comprise a "trio of beef" showcasing various tasty cow parts
For dessert, it's hard to beat the top-notch cheese platter, but a gewurztraminer panna cotta in melon soup comes close
For Restaurant Week, a friend and I wanted to try out a restaurant that we normally wouldn't be able to afford
At 6pm, we called Montrachet and were able to get a 9PM reservation
Even though we ordered off the RW menu, food and service was impeccable
Waiter treated us as though we were just as important as the people around us, surely spending much, much more than us
Although a bit cramped, it was a delightful experience and if you have the $$$, I highly recommend
Went for BYOW night
Food was exceptional
Servings were appropriately sized
HOWEVER, had to flag the sommelier down twice to ask for our wine to be opened and served while we had almost finished the main course (although he was knowledgeable) and wait staff was excruciatingly slow to refill water and wine glasses
Waiter was completely unattentive, did not return to table to check on how the meal was after serving, and left us with dessert menus for 30 minutes before returning to see if we wanted to order
Restaurant was not even crowded
I had dinner at Montrachet recently and had a wonderful time
The restaurant is small and lovely, it was like stepping into a romantic bistro in Paris
The food was excellent, we had a tasting menu of smoked salmon and caviar, Chilean Sea Bass, foie gras, magret of duck, steak, a cheese plate and amazing creme brulee
The wines were exceptionally good, and the sommelier was very helpful in selecting two bottles for us
I would go back in a minute! They also have prix fixe specials that give amazing value for your money
Montrachet is worth checking out if only maybe for dessert
The dishes we ordered (the two of us got 3-course meals) were subpar and non-inventive
The desserts were the only saving grace
The service is nice and unassuming
The restaurant was a disappointing experience that did not meet our expectations

Well, if they keep treating people that way, they'll be lucky if they can get the people to spend the money
When you spend top dollar, you should get top service
They need a makeover
Everything from the tattered menus to the pretentious manger, Nobu isn't what it used to be
My wife and I were recently in New York and we thoroughly enjoyed Nobu in Tribeca
We had heard so much about it and the food, ambience and service exceeded our expectations
We will definitely go back when we return to the city!
I was lucky enough to be turned on to Nobu when I moved to Soho, I now dine there several times a week
Better than the sushi in Japan, and I would know
If you have the opportunity and the financial resources, this is the place
It is not for the timid
Nobu is brilliant! BUT you must expect to pay extraordinary amounts of money for good food! AND you must order as many dishes as possible! I visited Nobu with a couple of coworkers (luckily we were able to make last minute reservations!)
We practically had EVERYTHING on the menu (including the specials)
Yes, the portions are small and expensive
But the service, quality and taste far exceeded our expectations
The cod was heavenly - and literally melted on my palette! You have to expect to spend at least $100-$200 per person at Nobu
Spending less is unjustified! Go to Nobu - but don't do it on an empty pocket
Then - and only then - will you have truly tasted how brilliant Morimoto is!
Nobu definatly lives up to expectations! I went there with my husband for his birthday last weekend and had a absolutly fabulous time
I highly recommend to all
I went to Nobu for a special occasion
The servings were laughably small
I spent about $150 on dinner and left hungry
There are plenty of better sushi restaurants in the city! The decor was nice and the service was decent
My lovely wife intuitively felt belittled after she told our waiter that she didn't eat fish
What's more, we could hear the waiters chatting amongst themselves about how we shouldn't even be there because of this! I couldnt believe the audacity they displayed
I suppose they dont need modest folks like us since they get plenty of business from NYs ultra-trendy yuppies
As for us, we will NEVER go to Nobu again
I thought it was supposed to be the best but was severely disappointed
My job sends me all over the world which has allowed me to eat at some of the most amazing restaurants in the world
I was hoping this one was one of those places since weve read/heard so much about it
But NEVER AGAIN, especially since my wife, who is the kindest person I know, was treated/viewed with such contempt
ALWAYS TRUST A WOMANS INTUITION!
Despite some negative reviews, I gotta say that Nobu lives up to hype as an ultra-trendy restaurant with some of the best Japanese inspired food in America
Pretty pricy and the service is inconsistent but it's still a great time out
In January, I visited Nobu for the 4th time
We were seated promptly and ordered cocktails
We then ordered the $80
00 Omakase and wine
A few minutes later a wonderful dish of Touro was placed before us
After we had finished 3/4 of the Touro, the waiter came over removed the dish and our plates and said that we were mistakenly served the dish
I complained to the manager who said he would personally take care of the matter
We should have left then and just paid for the cocktails, but we stayed
The manager never came to our table and the restaurant didn't offer anything to compensate for the error (they could have taken the two cocktails off the check )
The Omakase dinner was nowhere near the quality on three previous occasions
Nobu is on the decline
I would not return
I remember the Goodole days Morimoto-san would make elaborate omakase creations, tickling imaginations with perfectly balanced flavors gorgeous arrangements
Sadly, since he left it hasnt quite recovered
Its good but not grand and STILL living on hype from the past
Meanwhile, Japanese cuisine has come of age in the U
S
and Nobus turned into that uncle holding onto his glory days from the 70s
This is NYC! To be the best youve got to be on top of it; staying abreast, innovative, intense, cutting-edge, etc! Theyve become stagnant and its truly disappointing
Some dishes are good -like 3- but not much else
Recently, Ive noticed most of the clientele are tourists trying their luck to catch a glimpse of someone famous
Better luck next time! Cause too many onlookers killed the restaurants star-credentials
Like I said, its not really about the food anymore and rightly so
-TRUE EPICUREANS DINE ELSEWHERE-
I joined my husband and his business patner with her spouse
We made the reservation a month prior for a Friday night 6:00pm sitting---No problem
When we arrived at Nobu we were seated promptly
We ordered the Omakase at $100 per person
it was incredable
The cold seaafood dishes had such wonderful aroma and taste
The traditional sushi, which is served right before desset was bland in comparison to all the other courses we had
Please treat yourself to teh tasting menu if you are willing to try new foods
The servings are small however after 7 courses you are stuffed
Our waiters were prompt and they made sure that we enjoyed ourselves
They did not rush us at all
I will return again
We had no reservation and got on the list for the sushi bar
We also went to Next Door Nobu and got our name on the list there and then went around the corner for a drink
Nobu called first
When we got there they told us that a TABLE actually was available or we could sit at the sushi bar
I prefer the sushi bar so we left the table for some other lucky couple
Our waiter was very helpful to a couple of Nobu Noobs and suggested that we not order only sushi as they really shine in their other dishes
This proved to be correct
The sushi is good, but not the best
We had a couple of cold specialties which were good
Over all, I like sushi
I won't go back to Nobu for sushi
I may go back for the specialties
Without a reservation we put up a brave face and tried our luck and ended up with two seats at the sushi bar
We fully relied on our very capable waiter for choices of the menu and we were not disappointed
We have been spoiled by Sydney food and did not think we could find such good food in the US - we were wrong
Nobu rates as one of the best restaurant we've been to and is certainly in our top 3 restaurants
It is hard to describe why - you will have to go and try it out - very hard to wrong there
My experiance with Nobu was absolutely amazing
WE reserved a month in advance and it was completely worth the wait
Try the Rock Shrimp Tempura (cream sauce), Chicken Teriyaki (made Nobu style), California rolls and Bento Box for dessert
Words cannot describe how GOOD the food was
The service was fantastic as well- we were in a rush and they made sure we got our food/drinks/cheque quickly so we could make our show
A definite must in NY
The food was incredible
The Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno was unreal
Only thing negative relates to service
Took us 45 minutes to get our first plate, while other couples who sat after us were already on their 3rd
After some apologies, we were ready for entrees
Unfortunately they weren't what we ordered

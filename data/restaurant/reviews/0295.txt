Plus, dinner wasn't all that special anyway and the seating sucked
Who puts round tables with square tables? I couldn't even talk to my friends across the table
DON'T GO!
I read the review about the rude doorstaff before I went but had to go anyway for a friend's premiere party
The doorgirl was INCREDIBLY RUDE to me
I'm sure she wears her rudeness as a badge of honor so there's probably no point in complaining to management, but my advice is DON'T GO
As for the supposed pros of the place, there was one tiny hot tub with no one in it on the VIP floor, the drinks were weak, and there was little room to dance
DON'T GO
The people that work there at night have a holier than thou attitude that I completely cannot stand, and thus both times that I went to this place, I've never had the chance to see the elusive upstairs, even though my other friends were able to go up there
There are plenty of other cooler places in the meatpacking district that you can go to before you resort to this stuck-up venue
A friend was having a bday party
Upon arriving (there were approx 40 of us) we were told by the highly unintelligent front door girl the following did you dress in the dark or did your mommy dress you - we were coming from work in business attire
She proceeded to be highly prejudice utterly rude to us
She didn't like two men in the crowd she wouldn't let us in because their shoes were unacceptable to her
When we nicely ever so carefully (as not to confuse her)explained we are here for a party - she clearly stated We don't need your business - so if you don't need our business - don't worry - you will never see any of us again
Your place was dead on Friday night as it should be for such nasty behavior to patrons
You should be ashamed of yourself
I have been to this place twice with my friends and each time we see so many people hanging out by the DJ/dance floor requesting songs and NOT dancing
That should be the first indication that the DJ SUCKS! Not only can he not mix the music, he must also be blind and deaf
The place is fantastic
The crowd is great but please get a new DJ!!!
The shrimp sucks big time, although the service actually quite pleasant
The saving grace is the garden area only
The music was the basic average top 40 crap leaves no room for the imagination
I've been here multiple times with my friends and every time we've had a blast! There are multiple atmospheres for whatever you are in the mood for like an indoor bar, an outdoor heated park, an upstairs dance floor and rooftop lounge area
Music is good, dancefloor is crowded
But its easy to meet people and guys there are really friendly and attractive
Definitely a place to ensure a fun Saturday night
Briefly, the hostess seemed harried and nervous, although pleasant
The waiter we encountered was dismissive and bizarrely terse given the beautiful environment
The manager, oh the manager
ran into me while we were being seated, didn't apologize, seemed to have absolutely no restaurant sense
Because my husband is polite and chivalrous, he privately asked the manager to apologize for running into me
Instead of doing so, the manager came to our table and told us he'd be happy to take our orders off if we didn't like the way he ran his restaurant
and then proceeded to needle my husband further
as if to pick a fight
If I was an investor in this restaurant, I'd reconsider the unprofessional boy that calls this place his
I can't believe I was dragged to the park last weekend
The food and service was disastrous
I ordered a lobster tail and I felt sick the rest of the night
The tiny lobster tasted like shoe leather
When I commented to the server how displeased I was, he gave me a dirty look and mumbled something under his breath
When I approached the manager, he seemed completely spaced out and couldn't have cared less about my complaint
At one point, I overheard the manager standing around talking about other patrons
Not a very professional atmosphere
The bar was packed with BT crowd
I ran out of there as soon as I could and I NEVER intend to go back
No one in their right mind would ever be seen there, I'm sorry I ever had to go back
The Park used to be hot, about 4 years ago
I been to The Park several times and everytime the scene has been good and the out door dining the absolute best in the city! But like most places in NYC the weekend crowd is to be desired, but recently the Pentouse area of The Park is reserved for a hot VIP celebrity driven crowd and my friends and I had a blast last weekend!! Unlike before where anyone could go to the Penthouse at The Park now it is much more exclusive
I highly recommend it
I used to go to the Park and love the food, the service, the ambiance
Last night, we waited nearly one hour before the appetizers came out - including 45 minutes before a skimpy and somewhat stale bread basked was served
The food was unimpressive, to say the least
The shrimp seemed barely defrosted (3 shrimps per appetizer)
The seared tuna was crusted with so much pepper that it overwhelmed the taste - perhaps on purpose, as it did not seem to be of very good quality to begin with
The waiter seemed overwhelmed and kept apologizing for the kitchen
It took 2
5 hours to have an appetizer and an entree for the two of us
We did not order coffee or desert - we were afraid we'd be there all night
I read all of the reviews, a lot of which were negative, of The Park before going there a few weeks ago
Despite the negative comments, I went anyway since my friend said he really liked it
Anyway, I had SO MUCH FUN there with my friends! I'm really confused about the negative reviews, but I have only been there once, so who knows
But from my one experience, it's an awesome place and I didn't think the staff was rude at all
Anyway, I loved the outdoor seating area, which felt like a park, and all the different rooms, and especially the 2nd level where people start to dance later at night
The thing that didn't make sense to me, though, was how they make you wear bracelets but don't let you go out and come back in
I'd recommend going earlier than later to avoid the long line
I went there friday night with a group of about 10 of my friends to celebrate my bday
Initially, it was cool because we were all just drinking and chatting with the expectation that things would pick up later
However, after about 3 HOURS, we were all kinda sitting around staring at eachother
I could see bordem written on their faces (and i felt the same)
5 of them ended up leaving and 3 more were on their way out when the music finally started to pick up
but at that point, what was the sense in staying any longer? i was already upset at the time we had spent there and the fact that my friends were leaving!!!
oh, and on top of that, i had stepped outside at one point, already wearing a band-they asked me for an ID to get back in (?!?!?!)- totally ruined my bday
I was at The Park on Saturday night and the staff were terribly rude and unhelpful
When they finally opened the roof deck, there was an annoying line and the bouncers refused to let our small group (5) go up together
This kind of dismissive, snubbing attitude is uncalled for in any setting
Don't waste your time or money here
My freinds and I made dinner reservations two weeks in advance to sit out side but when we got there they sat us inside
We started out with drinks, vodka was watered down so much it tasted like Poland Spring, they have the worst Mojitos I ever drank,  even thou they are on top of their menu
The waiters are nasty and very, very sloooooooooow
It took them 2 hours just to serve us, and to make matters worse the food was nasty, we were sending it back one after the other
We ended with a few salads couple of drinks and a bill for $600
00 Yes I will never recoment this place to anyone
I was thrilled to try this place, but it ended up nearly ruining a birthday
Despite reservations, no table was set up when we got there
We waited
and waited
A look in the garden showed 6 staff chatting, but no table
We finally assembled the table ourselves, were dealt with rudely by the hostess and waitor, and waited at length for menus and drinks
The food was under par, we were charged $3 a plate for cake we brought (which they dropped) despite spending a fortune on wine and food
A 20% gratuity was added to our bill
WHAT?? The service did not merit half that
They began carding at the door, and would not let my friend in (she's 40) because she's foreign and did not have an ID
Huge attitude, so-so food
Could be great, sucks instead
DON'T BOTHER
I was here this past Saturday night and was extremely disappointed
There was attitude from the staff from the moment we walked in as if they were doing us a favor by serving us
The cold bartender spilled my friend's martini and did not offer to give her a refill

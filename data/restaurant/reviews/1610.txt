We all had to add salt to our meals and it didn't help make the food taste any better
They were out of the chicken entree and I asked the waitress what types of fish were in the fish stew and she told me shrimp, mussels, clams, salmon and seabass
When I received my entree there was only salmon and one small piece of seabass
I guess they didn't think I would notice
Don't waste your time and money
I've been in New York for two months, eating out frequently, and this is the best food I've had
The filet mignon was perfect, and small enough that there was still room for dessert
The sidecar was the best I've had anywhere
(Great job, bartenders!) The service was also among the best I've encountered - extremely polite, attentive, and respectful
I don't often feel so taken care of at a restaurant
We ate in the tavern, which had a 30-45 minute wait, but it was well worth the wait, and I'd wait again
The only drawback (and it was very minor) was that there were so many people in the tavern that the volume of voices was pretty loud, but conversation was still not difficult
We were overly impressed
we went here for our first year anniversary and were truly satisfied
We are not the type to drop 300 on a meal, but did not regret it in the least
They really think about the special touches to exceed other dining experiences, from the glass of champagne for us as soon as we were seated to the coffee cake they gave us at the end of the meal for the next morning
We had both tasting menus which cover an inventive array of the season's foods
This was the best and most memorable meal we've ever had!!
From the moment we arrived until four and a half hours later when we finished dining, the experience at Gramercy Tavern was exceptional
Our waitress, Faith, was very friendly and extremely knowledgable (her run through of the cheese tray was a thing of beauty)
When we informed her that we were non-drinkers, she treated us wonderfully with no attitude (which I have recieved at other restaurants) and offered us several non-alcoholic options
We enjoyed the seven course tasting menus which were beautifully executed
Every course was close to perfection
The mushroom tart on the vegetable tasting may have been one of the finest food experiences any of us at the table had ever experienced (the lamb on the Summer tasting was still outstanding, but that mushroom tart, mmm)
For those who say it's expensive, yes, it is, however, it's worth every penny
Memories are made from things like these
I've always had an outstanding experience at the Gramercy Tavern
It will always be one of my favorite places to go in the city
The food is exceptional each time
I enjoy that you can come here for a casual or formal occassion
The prix fixe menu is well worth experiencing again and again
Attentive staff, excellent food, etc
This was about a 3-hour event
Get reservations in the main dining room, order off the price-fixed menu, and plan to make an entire evening of it
Gramercy Tavern always presents the most amazing meals, with the perfect atmosphere
Eating here every night would truly be a dream come true
We have never had a bad meal or dining experience at Gramercy
From the bar, to the bar tables, to the dining room, they know exactly what they are doing all of the time
Flawless everytime and we eat here quite regularly and when we need to bring foodie friends for a great meal!! Perfect for a special occassion or celebration dinner
or just a mid-week treat
Exceptional
No other restaurant exemplifies the NYC dining experience like The Gramercy Tavern
An institution that amazingly maintains it's ultra high level of quality year after year
If you are not in the mood to wear a jacket while dining, don't fret, simply ask to be seated in the tavern room rather than the main dining room
The grilled scallops appetizer was cooked to perfection
Seared black bass with sauteed seasonal greens proved to be a strong entree choice
For dessert, try the coconut tapioca
Service was efficient and concerned but not hovering
To increase your chances of getting a table, visit at lunch
I was blown away by Gramercy Tavern
I've heard all the amazing hype about this place, but never experienced it for myself until recently
The food was out of this world good - especially the special that day - a poached egg sitting in white truffle buerre blanc with seasoned bread crumbs and fresh white truffles
I still dream of it today and my mouth waters when I talk about it
The tasting menu I had shortly after the special was utter perfection
Every dish has become a favorite of mine
I was forcing myself to finish the last two courses because they were simply divine
Am always skeptical about a restaurant that always gets rave reviews for fear of an anit-climax or a bad luck experience
This restaurant is a must do for any special occasion or for a feeling of civilized existence
Reba McIntyre, the singer who sat next to us seemed to enjoy herself also
Staff were wonderful, food even better and ambience from the smell that greets you to the beautiful dim lighting is fantastic
Dinner for 2 w/ 2 drinks inc
tip was $275 so be prepared to dig deep but it is a memory maker
Food was served cold, small portions, bad/awful/ inattentive waitstaff, waste of money, waste of an anniversary dinner
Did a make up dinner to make up for the horrible experience
My husband and I had a wonderful 2-year anniversary celebration at G
T
Visiting all the way from Texas, our experience at G
T
was the highlight of the entire trip
Excellent food and service complimented the the great atmosphere and set the mood for a special evening
Highly recommended for couples and special occassions
I ate at Gramercy for the first time when in Manhattan for work back in February
Sitting at a lengthy dinner with two corporate attorneys was not exactly my idea of a great night out in NYC (I'm from the South) but I wouldn't trade my night at Gramercy for anything
From the beautiful seasonal flower arrangements to the muslin-canopied cheese platter to the chilled lobster appetizer, this place is fabulous
I know nothing of the NYC dining scene, but I do know that the great food, wonderful service, and a clientele that (for a girl from Kentucky) could qualify as a spectator sport make Gramercy Tavern a place I would visit during every trip to the city
Wonderful!
I have eaten in many fine restaurants in this city and was looking forward to eat at Gramercy Tavern
While the room is great, grand and cozy at the same time and the service is right on, the food was just ok
Sure it was good, but I know of many places where I could have eaten food just as good or better for literally a fraction of the price
I was expecting one of those dinners that I'd remember for my entire life and that, it definetely wasn't
I've gone to the Gramercy Tavern for the tasting menu twice before
I've always spoke very highly of the place and mentally planned future occassions to be there
Something has changed
After going there tonight, I will never go back
The food was not the quality it used to be and was also very salty
Did they change chefs? Plus the prices went up
So for 2 dinners, 2 glasses of wine and tip, I left $252 poorer and wished I went to 50 other places in the city instead for 1/3 the cost
My husband and I ate at Gramercy Tavern to celebrate his birthday, and we had a wonderful dining experience (we were nervous the restaurant would be overrated, as many of the more expensive restaurants are
) He had the tuna tartar and the lamb, and I had the lobster and the rabbit (my very first rabbit meal!) The food the delicious, the drinks were perfect, and the servers/staff were extremely attentive and polite
It wasn't cheap, but it was worth every penny!
Finally was able to eat at Gramercy Tavern
Definately one of (if not the) best meals in Manhattan
A must do restaurant
Forget any thought of saving money and enjoy
Don't forget the cheese menu for desert and splurge for the lobster appetizer - you won't regret it
Visited Gramercy Tavern this week
Absolutely excellent service, almost too attentive
We had the summer tasting menu, which, while very good, was somewhat bland and over-salty in the savory courses
I would suggest dining in the beautiful and comfy bar in the front instead
One nice touch - if you have drinks at the bar before dining, bartenders ask if you would like to carry over your bar tab to the table

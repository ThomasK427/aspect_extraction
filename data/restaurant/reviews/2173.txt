then you decide if it deserves a 2nd visit
Pikachu is hard to please if you read it's other reviews but this place does get mixed reviews
Went there on a rainy day whim last night as I was in the area
The arching tile and wood panel siding make you feel like you'll walk out of there and hop into a checker cab on the way to your classic six on the Upper East Side, or jump onto a train to your awaiting cape in Yonkers
The three-martini hat wearing sort of vibe
A nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there
The food was good classic fare
Everything simple
A solid meal, but it didn't come cheap
Worth checking out
Simply the BEST seafood I've found anywhere in the world
The name says raw bar but they seem to offer almost everything from the sea (except Snow Crab)
Wines galore
I rate it a MUST VISIT whenever I'm in NY
Keep it going!
I love oysters, but I hate the oysters here! You scoop it in your moth and you end up with a mouthful of sand, dust or minerals
The butter cubs were like ice
I can't stand it when you try to spread the hard butter on your dinner roll and the roll falls apart because the butter was so frozen
The clam chowder tasted like Campbell soup
Actually, Campbell soup was better
The fish was bland and even the steamed vegetables tasted bad
Don't believe the other ratings or reviews
I love the Oyster Bar -- even more than its delicious chowders and biscuits, it's the old-style NYC atmosphere that's the real draw here
Sure it's loud and crowded, but the mobs of businessmen guzzling at the bar and the tables of publishing types and tycoons make for rare entertainment
A real NYC experience
I truly adore going to this wonderful establishment
The service is amazing and the wine and food are ADDICTIVCE
Ask for MARIO and, believe me, you will not forget your experience there!
I enjoy going to Grifone
Once you become a regular, you become part of the family
The food, the wine, the service all add up to perfection
The only better Italian food than Grifone that I've eaten was in Italy
I even proped to my wife while dining there
The wonderful staff made that evening even more special
Dine at Grifone, just once, you will go home happy!
I was there with my wife few days ago and to be honest after that  Joseph the former owner sold the place everything have changed even the food and there is nothing of italian anymore , you can seat and listen the waiters talk any languages but english or italian
I remember that we just sat on the table and the captain gave us the menu before to get a drink and he started to tell specials  and we don't understand almost nothing , his knowledge was zero
Looking for an EXCELLENT place, try Grifone
Many EXTRAORDINARY dishes and menu specials
Treated like Italian royalty
Truly taken care of by their EXPERIENCED and CARING staff
Have walked past this restaurant many times and finally dined there this weekend
Very mediocre food with presentation worthy of your local diner
If you are not a regular, you will be very blatantly ignored
Definitely not worth the price
Go elsewhere
I flet the waiter rushed us through the entire meal and when we asked for the ravoli appetizer he gave us a dinner order charged us $44 and spilt it amoung the four of us when only one of us wanted it
He did the same thing with the mussle appetizer
I asked for steak medium well on the well done side and he mocked me
I'm pregnant and can't eat under cooked meat, he said perhaps I can bring you shrimp
I was so insulted
What waste of time
My Husband had the Osso Bucco and said it was so-so
Also, there were four of us we each had a appetizer, main course and 1 bottle of wine and the bill was over $400

One of my top three restaurants in all of New York City
The food is incredible- fresh ingredients, highest quality, and they always have amazing desserts
The Owner is extremely charming and the service is a 10
Highly recommended for any occassion
I've eaten at Grifone a few times and it is consistently GREAT!!!
The portions are sufficient for their RICH flavor
VERY satisfying
The chicken and pasta dishes are amazing
And if you can make it to desert it's definitely worth it even though I was so full
Great date place or special occasion
VERY Romantic, cozy atmosphere
The best italian restaurant I've been to
I read about it on this website and decided to go
We (group of 4) walked in and we were seated right away
The service is so formal, it is a little intimidating at first
We immediately found out that although the service was formal, everyone was very pleasant
We asked a lot of questions and asked for recommendations and it was like we were best friends with the staff
The appetizers and entrees were delicious, the wine was outstanding (Formentini Merlot) and the service was out of this world
I'd recommend to anyone who wants a nice night out
We are long time fans of this restaurant, and they never let us down
The space is a little cramped, but the food is incredible, and the service overwhelming
Highly reccomended
I have been here a couple of times and if you want good ole Italian food, then this is definitely a place to go
It is a little bit of Little Italy in East Midtown
We had fried calamari and shrimp -It was average at best
We had bruschetta - The bread was soggy
Rizzoti with mushrooms and sausage - weird taste, almost medicine-like
Veal with Spinach - Veal was DRY and TOUGH
Desert was not as good as main courses
I would never go again
I highly NOT recommend
Save your money
I love everything about the restaurant! Everything on the menu is fresh, robust, and delicious! You can never go here too many times! The menu keeps changing and the dessert tray of fresh fruit tarts is very scintillating
Try the honey lemon cake, the tiramisu, the seafood ravioli, butternut ravioli, penne, soups, salads, it's all wonderful, esp
accompanied by a glass of house wine
Great for groups, clients, dates, pre-theater, and upscale after-work
I love the soft yellow colored walls, lighting, rustic wood tables and chairs, the hand painted Tuscan dishware, the fresh foccacia, the pungent olives, I could go on, and on, and on
A truely lovely room, in which sound unfortunately carries
The food and service are unparalled but I suggest trying for off times because when its crowded it gets a bit loud in there
The food here is excellent and the overall atmosphere is subtle
The mozzarella caprese is fantastic - one of the best in the city
Hizen is a great little find
The food is exceptional, service is always top notch and the prices are moderate
I work in this neighborhood and there are not many great restaurants, but Hizen is amongst the best
Hapon is also very good

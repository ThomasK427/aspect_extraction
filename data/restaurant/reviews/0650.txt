My ornage blossom cheesecake was wonderful and we got a side oder of pomme frites
A wonderful experience
Thoroughly enjoyed Cocotte's recent special southwestern French cuisine/wine pairing night
From the wonderful soup starter, the creative tasty escargot dish and the most delicious pork tenderloin ever through to the desert - it was all top notch
The 5 different wine pairings worked very well
Keep an eye out for these bi-monthly fixed price events
Looking foward to some of these dishes joining the usually delicious spring-time menu
We saw Cocotte advertise a special evening of Food and Oscars and thought we might go in for a quick meal and watch the first hour of the show
After seeing the show broadcast on a 15 foot wall while enjoying menu items and drinks modified to the nominees we were hooked for the night! The friendly service and delicious food will keep us coming back on many nights to come as well as next years Oscars!
Ive never been treated as rudely as I was at Cocotte
After we showed up early for our Valentine's Day reservations, we went to the bar to wait
Things started getting crowded as a cattle car
After quite some time, I noticed no one was being seated
Then I learned that people were being seated off the street while everyone else huddled in the back
People started demanding the tables theyd reserved
If they yelled loudly enough, sometimes they got one
Finally we wised up and tried to get a table
A gruff, sour manager grunted at us to sit in a tiny table by the kitchen
He angrily pulled the table out and then shoved it back in place, knocking over a vase and spilling water all over my girlfriends lap
No apology - he just muttered, Not off to a good start, eh? Like many others, we left
The best newcomer to the neighborhood
The bar and main room are comfy, and the boulliabaise and scallop app were delicious
Eager to go back to sample the desserts
Tried this newcomer to last night, the food was above average--tasty foie gras and escargots (huge portion of those), Cod entree was great, Scallop entree special was good
Service was beyond lousy--and our waitress was training someone too (I hope he learned what NOT to do)
I'd return for the food and pray for a changeover in the waitstaff
Nice to have a good local French place, food is better than decent the staff accomodating
Nice decor good value
The place won't rock your socks but you will certainly not be dissapointed either
The food wasn't bad and was pretty cheap
My friend got a steak which she liked and I had to salmon which was alright
There isn't much in the way of ambience at all
The service was pretty slow but at least the waitress was friendly
If you are looking for a decent cheap meal and are in the neighborhood then this place is alright
I wouldn't go out of the way to go though
The food was wonderful, the waitstaff was very friendly and I would definitely go back
Great service, amazing prices and pretty darn good food
2-1 Monday dinner specials and best Sunday brunch in NYC
A big group of us go here every Friday night to see an awesome RB/funk/soul band play - the food (a lavish buffet) is great, the drinks are strong and inexpensive, the band rocks and we all dance like fools until midnight
The owner is so friendly and the service is exceedingly prompt
A great place to warm up for a night out on the town, or to make your night out on the town!
I've been to Mr
Babbington's many times and each time is better than before
There is a nice mix of people which is what MAKES a place SPECIAL!!
When you leave you can't wait to go back
The Owner Joe is a speacial kind of person
He'll bend over backwards to make you happy and truely cares that you had a good meal and a good time
Have anything from Ribs to Steak you won't be disappointed
The servers are friendly and know their stuff
You'll find anything from 2 for 1 specials on Mons
To poetry on some nites,Maybe even Kareoke or a Dance Contest or gospel music on Sundays
things are always changing so give a call or bet yet just stop by
If you want, Tell Joe where you saw this reveiw and watch his reaction! Tell 'em Eric sent ya! PEACE!l
The Scene Nestled next to organic foods on the second floor of the wondrous but chaotic Fairway Market, this casual, gourmet cafe serves breakfast all day, as well as a hearty selection of sandwiches, burgers and salads
Its lofty ceilings, exposed brick walls and huge windows (kept open in nice weather) create a placid alternative to the traffic jam of shoppers below
Service is spotty, but you can amuse yourself while you wait by reading the witty signs on the walls, including one that bans Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson from the premises
The Food The miscellany of fresh food here is prepared with a flourish
The fresh fruit plate becomes an architectural arrangement with powdered sugar lovingly sprinkled around the rim
Pancakes and crullers are habit-forming, and the popular Mediterranean plate offers a mini-buffet of four vegetable sides topped by salmon, tuna or chicken
I heard that this was a very reasonable priced steakhouse
I ordered the filet medium and it came out well done
I would rather go to Angelo Maxie's for steak for the price I paid
It was pricey for the quality
The only redeeming part was the side items
It's hard to find (up the stairs of the grocery store), but for brunch Fairway Cafe can't be beat
I hate to say this because it might spoil it, but it's line free, with delicious food
All of the fresh ingredients from downstairs turn up incredible upstairs
Sure, the ambiance is lacking and the service can be spotty, but at these prices for this food, you can overlook it
The egg dishes are perfect - the brioche toast melts in your mouth
The pancakes are more a mix of crepe and pancake and are incredible
The meditterranean plate is healthy food at its best
I haven't been for the BYOB steakhouse at night, but if the burger is an indication, we should all hurry!
The space and furnishings are too spartan and the service amateur and scattershot (no smiles offered here - busboy serves mains with who gets the
?)
Further staff training is a must, as what might be a nicely relaxed atmosphere rapidly deteriorates into the sense that one has been abandoned at table
That said, for steak on the Upper West Side and considering there is no corkage fee, one can enjoy a passable meal for a very low price
The bread is very good; shame it takes four pleas to enjoy more than one small slice per person
The strip steak is decent, but lacks entirely the mineral undertones of the properly dry-aged offerings at Sparks, Peter Luger, or NY Strip House (on its good days)
The ubiquitous molten chocolate cake (billed incorrectly as a Galette) is fine
The recent reviews are right - the staff is HORRIBLE!!!  I went for a bday party, note: got in for free, drank and danced a lot
However, the staff was so bad that I wouldn't recommend this place for any group events
Zoo animals could run this place better
Don't go
I'll never go back
The door staff is the worst
Did these guys get picked on in high school, or do they have small wankers???
Went to Link last night and had possibly the worst bartender of all time
First of all she could barely make a margarita and then charged us 16
00 including the up charge mentioned in other review
She was rude and really shoudl go back to tending bar at Hooters or Fridays
Calamari was really bad coated in some kind of sandy coating that made me gag
Way over priced Drinks for a bar that belongs in Queens rather than hip Manhattan
The attitude of the staff in this place is unreal
I wanted to throw my drink in the snotty bartender's face
She acted like it was a hassle to serve us; I suggest she find another line of work
And what is with the $2 up fee?
Chris the General Manager is oen of the best in the city
The venue is now under new ownership (which is about time) and have switched gears to more of a party scene then a private restaurant
the drinks are fairly expensive and the sound is choppy, but the palce looks great and is really well done, the bartenders are on point (all attractive and friendly), and the vibe inside is really relaxed
The L shape promotes the idea of dance space, but it's really just a lounge

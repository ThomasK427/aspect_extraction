why do people like this place? cuz its big and kinda trendy looking for a meal under $10
Not a fan
As a veg, there is nothing tasty to eat
Why not help us out? My back hurts on those bench seats
Better off at Spice down the road
noodle noodle on the wall
geez, this place is full of noodles
sa though the walls were not good enough, the menu is packed with them too! the food is great and cheap but can get overdose of noodles
Republic has always been a hit and miss for me
The place is great if you are in a mood for noodles
because thats about all they have
Good thing is the quantity is so large you can easily share with a friend
Try their Salmon, its really good
I must have seen six or seven models--both male and female--in this trendy spot, but my pad thai was not nearly as attractive
How hard is it to make a quality Pad Thai? Creative space and nice clientele, but otherwise skip this place
the portions are small, the price is high compared to chinatown, the service is mediocre, the seats are comfortable, and the food tastes like any ordinary chinese food restaurant
This is a fabulous, affordable, busy restaurant! However, please be advised about the Chicken Udon
: ( The noodles are like worms and the sauce reminds me of something worse than brussel sprouts and why they ever put this catastrophe on the menu is unknown to me
I request that they remove it so noone else makes the same mistake
Please try the Coconut Crusted Shrimp as an app and the BBQ Pork or Seared Marinated Salmon for an entree
Not only are these safe, but outstanding, like candy in your mouth
republic is great place to go for a quick bite of noodles and for a pretty reasonable price
i always go there and get the pad thai which is actually pretty decent
the decor is very industrial, ikea-esque
service is fast and the wait people are nice
It's asian food served to you in a loud crowded restaurant while you sit on some picnic benches where you sometimes have to share the table
Food is ok
Small portions
Lychee martini was good
been here a few times
Always enjoy myself, but food isn't always the greatest
Great for a quick bite with friends



enjoyable
I went here for a dinner with some relatives from out of town that I was eager to catch up with, but the noise level at this place made that really difficult! I was practically screaming at my aunt across the table for her to hear me
The food was tasty though
Everyone enjoyed their food
I liked that the Pad Thai had a lot of vegetables in it, but I didn't think that the sauce was as flavorful as other places I've had it at
It was a fun place with decent service, just unfortunately too loud for me to enjoy
Its always crowded and always loud
But the food is consistent good
The crowd would make you think a long wait, but the wait is never too long, and sometimes you just NEED some really good chicken satay
Republic is too noisy but I enjoy their food
They have great appertizers and their noodle are just terrific for my taste
And the prices are very affordable, specially for dinner
attentive, fast, friendly staff with good inexpensive food
I am coming back again and again and again when I am in town, bringing friends
Living steps from Union Square, I must have eaten here a 3-digit-number-of-times in the past years
I don't know much about restaurants but these guys seem to do something very well
Always busy, always tasty food (almost) always very fast
this spot is made to eat
it is one of the most functional places i've ever been to: you eat you go
And that's probably what i like most of Republic: simplicity in its purest form within human boundaries
This is a great place to go if you want a large, inexpensive meal in Union Square
The dishes are pretty good, but the best part is the price
And I never finish my entire meal, because they give you so much
If you like noodles and fast, efficient service, Republic is a great restaurant for you
Do the same people own Wagamama's in London? If not, this place is sort of a rip off
But, the location is great and the food is relatively yummy and affordable
From the overly loud room to the more than disappointing Pad thai, everything about Republic stinks
The drinks we ordered to start our meal were horrible, the service was horrendous and the food just plain made me lose my appetite
Go over to 2nd Ave's Holy Basil if you want some kick-ass Thai food
For anyone who's been to London and tried Wagamama, you know what I mean with the title
This restaurant is a total rip-off of that London noodle chain from the communal dining tables to the restaurant name with the red star above it
The space is noisy and food mediocre at best
My advice is to head south to Chinatown where you can get better food at half the price and that communal dining experience too!
The food was very good, but after waiting for 40 minutes for a seat, being rushed off by our waitress, and yelling across the table at my boyfriend (we sat at a cafeteria style table in between two parties that wound up being old college buddies), my lasting impression of a restaurant I had waited to try was not a good one
Our waitress asked us if we were ready to order, and when I said no, but we would like drinks
she quickly walked away without taking notice
When we tried to switch seats to let the college guys sit together we were brushed aside after asking a runner who seemed to not care, and our waitress was nowhere to be found
I couldnt even hear myself think, and everyone else's conversations at the communal table, distracted me too much to even try talking to my date
even though this place is trendy, it doesn't compare to wagamama's, a GREAT japanese noodle place in london
this place tries, but it is way too loud and echoey, and the food is mediocre
Great food
hands down
However the place is very loud so it is hard to hear a conversation
Service could be better but the price is so right
Great noodles! I've always had really good service there, friendly waiters, until I encountered these two very snotty bartenders who didn't acknowledged my existence!!! It took forever to put my order in, then they forgot, then they wouldn't give me change back
I had to go to the hostess
I haven't been back since
Get a better staff!!!
It's not what it used to be
The pan-Asian cuisine's passable, though occasionally a bit greasy, and the space, with its vertical waste and mass tables can be a bit offputting when it's crowded
Still, for a quick, cheap bite in Union Square, it's a better bet than nearby Zen Palate, where the line never lets up
The food is OK--used to be better
The main problem is the space itself: It's too big, too noisy, too busy
Eating here is like eating in a factory cafeteria
It's fine for grabbing a quick bite if you're in the neighborhood, but I don't see why anyone would actually want to spend a leisurely dinner here
My roomates and I eat at The Big Ench every third night
The food is consistently good and you can't beat the price
Whether you are going with the ground beef or stewed chicken, the big enchilada always fills you up for around $5
Although my friend is convinced that the people behind the counter laugh at him in Spanish when he goes in, I have never had a problem
Buen Provecho!
This is one of those places with plastic utensils where you place an order and wait for your food
True, portions are large, but everything seems to have the same ingredients and taste pretty much alike
Do not confuse this with a real Mexican restaurant
It may work for a fast snack, but that's about it
We tried to order from here one night and though we live reasonably close, the explanation of where they deliver was confusing and made no sense

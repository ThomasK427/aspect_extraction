Cool decor
I loved the water fountain
it was great to hear the water run in the background
This is definitely a go-backer
Had dinner here this past Friday night with some friends and Salmon River definitely did not disappointment
We heard a lot of hype about this place (all good) and after trying it for ourselves, we all agreed
I had the salmon as did two of my buddies, another had the halibut and the odd man out tried the filet mignon
We were all pleased and would definitely venture here again
The portions are good, the prices fair and the service was attentive - this is just what midtown needed!
The Scene Prime real estate provides instant appeal to this first restaurant from high-end grocer Citarella
West-facing windows open to a fabulous view of Sixth Avenue, with the dancing fountains of the McGraw-Hill Building just across the street
Inside, pink and aquamarine portholes filled with miniature displays of fish and coral spell out a nautical theme
Service is competent, but the pace of the meal can be labored
The Food Chef Brian Bistrong, formerly a chef under David Bouley, cooks with the luxurious intent of chefs like Geoffrey Zakarian and Todd English
In its weakest moments, the food feels unfocused, as in a tempura of soft-shell crab with an acidic onion stew
But there's no denying the freshness of the product, and many dishes--a simple corn chowder with crabmeat, baked halibut with cardamom-scented lentils, striped bass with clams, celery and potatoes--are clear, if not earth-shaking, successes
Went there for a special celebration
The restaurant was quiet and intimate
The service was very attentive and very generous
We had tons of great food, wine, and desserts
Really Lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area
Took my parents there, expecting good seafood
Ordered grilled Halibut layed over lump crab
also tried the chilled Oysters
Food and wine were excellent, and the restaurant's desserts were to die for
Yet, the servers would forget things we ordered and it took them 10 minutes to process the credit card (they forgot)
Moreover, the restaurant was practically empty on a Saturday evening
Excellent food and I commend the chef and dessert chef, yet the servers must be shown how to make the restaurant's patrons feel like they're getting a bargain for the high prices they must pay
The Scene Inside this elegant Tribeca charmer, candlelight flickers off creamy painted wainscoting and the welcome is warm, even to walk-ins
Co-owners Danny Abrams and Jimmy Bradley have the sophisticated-comfort vibe down pat; one could entertain a client or splurge with friends here with equal aplomb
The Food The kitchen has a happy affinity for seasonality and simplicity, letting the pure flavors of his top-notch ingredients do the work
Deep orange wild King salmon gets a potent horseradish-lemon-Dijon mustard crust that stands up to the rich fish; a juicy pork chop is a marvel of tenderness, caramelized on the outside, silky pink within
There's a slight tendency to undercook the vegetables: Cute, thumbnail-sized Brussels sprouts and fat white butter beans may arrive semi-hard
But that just leaves more room for the splendid desserts, including a gorgeously tart Meyer lemon meringue pie, or a roulade of Valrohona chocolate mousse topped with a shimmering round of orange granita
This is one of the best restaurants we have ever been to in NY
The food is comforting and has great flavors
Crispy Chicken was AWESOME! Nothing bad can be said about this place
I must say
The ambiance in this restaurant is awesome the food mumm good
I couldn't stop thinking of it the next morning
The wine is delicious
I will definitely return
Thanks for great service
The service and ambience at The Harrison is top-notch, but it's the food served here that makes this restaurant worth coming back to
New American has never been one of my favorite cuisines, but The Harrison's appetizers and entrees have turned me into a fan
The combinations may seem unusual, but trust me, the taste is delicious!
This place always has consistent fare but it is not as good as it used to be
There are some good dishes okay dishes now where before everything was good
Service is always cordial professional
Nice ambience
Simple continental
Nice plus is window doors all around so seems roomy airy
We just came back earlier this evening from the Harrison for our Thanksgiving Dinner and OH MY GOSH!!! It was so great
The portions at first seemed somewhat small but believe me by the time you finished the meal which included appetizer, entree, side and dessert you are absolutely stuffed!! The creme brulee was the most amazing dessert
It was the best I have ever had
The prices are a bit steep ($11 for a cosmo!) but it was the kick-off for the holiday season
Definitely on our list to return!
NYC is oftentimes difficult to navigate if you're in a wheelchair; and that's once you get passed people's rude and insensitive behavior to the city's disabled
The staff at The Harrison, however, from the manager who brought out a heavy plank of wood to help bring my friend's chair into the restaurant, to the waiter who doted on my friend and I with attention and smiles, is an exception to this
What kind, courteous and non-condescending service we received
I would certainly come back; the food was delicious (though not plentiful) and the setting is absolutely gorgeous without being pretentious
The Harrison is worth the trip down to Tribeca
Even though you might be dining next to Citigroup and their clients, the food was great
The atmosphere was casual and professional
They had beautiful cherry blossoms and a great selection of seafood
The dessert of delicious
I would definitely return
On my visit to New York my boyfriend booked a reservation here for our anniversary and the food and service was wonderful
Our skate and cod dishes were cooked perfectly and tasty but it was the Peeky Toe Crab appetizer that blew us away (highly recommended)
The food also came out pretty quickly
Good for special occasion dining
Make sure to make reservations
The maitre de, waitress, wine expert were phenomenal, which sounds odd as the first thing to mention but the service really made this a great evening
The food is very good, very creative, with a lot of great seafood options
Wine list is very extensive
A bit on the pricey side, but worth it
In a very cool part of town
All in all a great place, and a great sophisticated evening out
Certainly not a hip, happening place
More adult than young place
I had not been here in a couple of years went on a Thursday w/o reservations
Host staff are still very professional very attentive
Up keep of the space is well maintained
Food is still good but nothing special
Price is very decent also
Not running back here anytime soon but still a good staple restaurant in Tribeca
You should reallly update your site
The chef of the harrison is no longer Joey
He was great but the new chef named Brian Bistrong is truly awesome
It brings the place to another level
Check it out
We LOVED the Red Cat so we had very high expectations for The Harrison
We showed up SO late for our reservation and they still sat us immediately (we did give a courtesy call and they told us not to worry!)
It was such a cozy environment and we just had a great dining experience
I had the lamb and the meat just fell off the bone, the way its supposed to! The food was phenomenal, tasty but simple and just well prepared
The waiter was very knowledgeable about the wine list and dessert was just decadent! I cannot wait to go back
Innovative food of good quality
Great deserts
Good wines
You should go

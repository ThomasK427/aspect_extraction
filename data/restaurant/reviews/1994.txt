I made reservations and regardless, waited almost a half hour past our reservations to be seated
Our waiter was anything but attentive
The bread was cold and bland tasting (a good Italian restaurant should have great warm bread), my Arugula salad was way too salty and was topped with hard, stale shaved parmesan
My boyfriend's homemade Fusili was nothing more than boxed rigatoni (stubby tightly-coiled pasta) overcooked, and when questioned about it, the waiter insisted that the long wavy pasta we are used to calling Fusili is not authenticly Italian
WHAT?!? Good presentation of the food was also extremely lacking
This restaurant should not be allowed on Mulberry St!
Recently ate at SPQR and came away one happy patron
The ceasar salad was to die for
I then had a veal chop that still makes my mouth water
My girfriend had a pasta dish with fresh mozzarella and a pomodoro sauce that was perfect
Truely a great overall experience
Will return!!
The Scene Club-style beats surging from sculptural speakers compete with the uproar from happy patrons at this Argentine meat market
Mustard-colored walls and a few lazy ceiling fans give the stylishly relaxed look of a French bistro, but the air quivers with energy, as if tables are soon to be pushed aside for a dance floor
On weekends, international couples, tired of a table between them, head to the intimate upstairs lounge
The Food On this casual Argentine bistro menu, the rib-eye with fries and chimichurri sauce is always a solid choice--the steak is nicely marbled and cooked with care
Other winners include the filet mignon, fresh, grilled spicy sausage and lamb chops with herbed mashed potatoes
And no matter what, don't skip the flan caramel with dulce de leche for dessert
With so many better places to eat steak in the city - and the rude serice at Novecento - can't see any reason to go back
We visited with a party of 10 (had been to the Miami Novecento several times - which is actually good)
Got there and apparently our reservation was cancelled (host claimed we hadn't called to confirm it - yet we never received call from them - and we had made the reservation only a couple of hours before), a couple of the skirt steaks were overcooked (ordered medium rare, got well done), two desserts were never brought out, Tarte Tatin tasted of garlic (???)
From now on, sticking to Hacienda de Argentina next time we crave a good cut of argentinian steak
Novecento (Fernando) left a message on my cellphone and stated that they will pay back the extra-charged dinner
He was apologetic
Nonetheless, I do not understand why I would be charged 18% gratuity for a party of only two
We were dressed well, polite, and did not make any retorts or excessive demands during dinner
I was pretty close to calling the owner (my secretary was able to find it), but I will retire at this point
I have been to Novecento in Buenos Aires, and I am sorry to say the the original in New York is quite poor
With so many other restaurants in NYC, I see no reason to go here
I see that I am not the only unhappy customer
If others have problems, you should feel free to discuss the issue with the owners of the restaurant, Mr
and Mrs
Fernando and Maria Dallorso
Came here with a date and immediately liked the room and nice bar scene even though we had a bit of a wait despite a reservation
We ordered a bottle of wine
After taking unusually long to bring the wine, the waiter could not open the bottle and had to get a different one
After struggling again, he finally got it open and filled our glasses
The wine was good and the food was very good and fairly priced
As we were finishing up, the waiter came back to tell us that they needed our table for a reservation and asked if we could finish our drinks at the bar
Being rushed is one thing, being rushed when you're delayed by their own incompetence is another
Too bad
Novecento? Never again
I have been to Novecento twice during visits to New York and both times the food and service have been very good
We were seated promptly and the wait staff have always been attentive
It is a relaxing restaurant, good for couples and small groups, but can get a little crowded
There is a variety of menu selections including excellent meats and seafood, salads and desserts
The wines are very good
The only drawback is that it is a little pricey for what it is
But, if you are looking for a good meal in SOHO I definitely recommend Novecento
This is everything you want in a SoHo restaurant and then some
The ambience is tops, the steaks are phenomenal (make sure to get the skirt steak), and the place has tons of character
Very romantic and a great spot the city from where to go elsewhere after your meal
I really have no knocks on this place, the owner served us quickly promptly
didnt give us a hard time when we didnt order drinks or apps got us our food fast warm
I love this place, definetly going back
I have been to several the $$$-$$$$ restaurants in NYC and NOVECENTO is one of the best in service, food and of course trendy ambience as well
The decor is not as fancy as some of the others although, you cannot resist the Seafood Linguini and their famous Argentinian Skirt Steak with Chimichutti sauce! Most of the servers are from Argentina which makes the place feel more like the country
Good wine, fabulous food and great service with the chic and trendy crowd! What more can you expect?
My usual place to go for steak frites in SoHo
Great tasting meat, intimate if slightly noisy ambience and the service is slightly less attentive than it could be but is done with charm
Only gripe is that it is a little bit pricey for for what it offers
Otherwise a safe bet
We were a party of three, I was an hour late, my friends did not even want to eat appetizers before I arrived and despite being packed to capacity, they were never rushed
The wine selection was great and true to Argentina, the staff friendly and I can't seem to get enough of that free range beef
Overall I thought the food was OK but the service was quite poor
The waiter was curt and somewhat rude to us
When we finished our meal the manager came over to our table and asked us to leave because he had a party waiting for the table
It pretty much ruins the dining experience when you are pushed out the door after you eat
and i'm usually not much of a steak eater
but this place is great
the space is very comfortable - they don't rush you - you don't have a server holding your bill in their hand asking if you'd like anything else
you get to ask for the check when you're ready
the fries were really good - another thing i don't eat often - but when you order fries they need to be awesome
i would definitely go back again on our next nyc trip
I had a good time with a group at this restaurant
The skirt steak was fantastic
Its a great spot and I enjoyed it
I was told about this place from a friend who swore by it
and she was right
Argentine steak is by far the best
The restaurant is very romantic, went for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend
Lit by candles and is very quiet
The wine list is very good but nothing beats the enormous and delicious filet mignons
The waiters aren't overly nice, but I guess that is what you get for soho
does have great atmosphere and extreamly reasonable prices
A must try if you are a true carnivore!
Novecento has AMAEZING food if you are a hardcore Carnivore!! And Yes Argentine beef is the best in the world, and Novecento has it!! I highly recomend the Filet Mignon!!! mmmmm The Milanesa is awesome too
actually whatever you order is great! Never had a bad meal! And yes, the nightlife rocks too!!
i went here over the summer
we didnt eat here; we just went upstairs to dance
the music was amazing
very deep trance and house
the people were all really into the music and dancing
very good vibes
owner is very nice
serious techno fans would enjoy
sunday night was pretty good, 2nd floor was packed, the tunes were pretty good, mostly deep house and techno
Crowd was mostly interested in getting dusted
But you can't ask for a better scene on a sunday
I was there about a year and a half ago and remembered the food was excellent

Worth every penny and every second
I love this place
I have heard how good it is but this is NYC, there's good sushi everywhere
I was pleasantly surprised to see that even better was available in this little Brooklyn locale
I didnt' try the saki but there was a wide variety
A little expensive on the alcohol but the prices of everything else were worth it
Try the pork dumplings for an appertizer
The miso soup come with the miso paste on the side so you can decide how much to put in
And the rolls are fantastic
The dragon roll is a must try
Like the other Bromberg Brothers establishments, expect the customer is always wrong attitude from the staff along with overpriced wines you never heard of, no bar, tiny waiting area and lousy desserts
We've been waiting for a good sushi place in Brooklyn but THIS isn't it
Blue Ribbon Sushi in Brooklyn is well worth a visit
From the open and comfortable all-booth (except for the sushi bar itself) seating to the remarkably friendly and caring service, to the wonderful sushi and sashimi, this place is a definite winner
Not only is their sushi among the best in the city, they offer items not usually seen outside of Japan
Do yourself a favor and give this place a try
The wait staff and sushi were excellent
The hostesses were unprofessional, unwelcoming and totally frazzled and not in control
The sushi here is fresh and creative
But the best thing here has got to be the green tea creme brulee
Creme brulee is normally too sweet for my liking but with the green tea flavoring it is just heaven!!
Probably the best Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn, and in Manhattan, I love Japanese restaurants and tried so many, including Nobu
Their fish is delicious and the sushi, some of the freshest and the best, more melting one
Try their chef special, you'll not regret it
The Scene Mismatched maritime photos and framed maps decorate white walls; wine-sippers and diners who'd rather stay put and dig in than wait for a table pack the bar nightly
Despite the casual, come-as-you-are air, there's an easy refinement to the place
In fact, it feels so much like a misplaced West Village restaurant that diners could easily mistake the place for Mary's or Pearl
The Food Whatever you do, don't miss the fried oysters; barely cooked and paired with a simple tomato butter, they're perfection
Dip lovers won't be disappointed with the blue crab version, and the clam fritters aren't too shabby, either
Entrees, though, are the high point
Catalan seafood stew, packed with lobster, scallops and cod, is spicy and excellent, as are the scallops in a bacon-butter sauce
Dinner ends with a demitasse cup of pudding--a sweet and appropriately simple ending
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC
My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one
We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right
We will be back
This place doesn't feel like the city
If you get to eat out back, you are in a nice fenced in garden
Portions are a good size and quite tastey seafood
The Rasberry Margarita's are made with real handcrushed elements and very tastey
There are a selection of nice german and fishermen beers
Apt, dinner, and a couple drinks run about 80 bucks
Little high for the east village but defeinantly worth it
If you go, go early, or you'll be waiting for a table
Wait staff was more than accomodating
It started to rain while outside and we were moved to a table inside while there was a line for tables
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience
There are several options as far as seating goes (out front, inside, garden in back, etc
) The service was good and so was the food
Not cheap, but not that expensive either
Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55
00, not including tip
Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you don't want to drop a ton of cash
Oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices
Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high
The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation
service was efficient courteous
two of us got the lobster roll ($24) while the other two opted for the codfish (w/sweet pea risotto in a carrot reduction) ($21)
the bread on the roll was soft and buttery
the lobster salad was fresh-tasting, but they couldve been a little more generous with the meat
the bay fries were well-seasoned and came with vinegar for dipping (ketchup available)
the codfish was decent and fresh (the reduction was especially interesting), but i found the white flesh slightly bland, though the skin was seasoned to perfection
in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse
overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well
Mermaid Inn used to be that reliable warm restaurant you would visit when you wanted a sure thing
Now the only reliable thing is the dessert cup at the end of the meal
I love the spag
w/ salad on top, but that has been relegated to Sunday (and Sundays only, the staff will not even entertain plopping a salad on top of spaghetti - which they already have anyway - just for you)
This is esp
strange as the waitress mentioned they eliminated spag
w/ salad but brought it back due to customer demand
Unfortunately those customers did not demand it every day
Maybe they are trying to shift some income to a slower day, but the consensus among my friends is that we will just go elsewhere
The spag
w/ scallops/shrimp which replaced my fav dish is subpar and extremely salty
I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn
Finally, after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be
We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner
All of it was simply amazing, unique and tasty and best of all it didn't break the bank
The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed
All in all a wonderful experience, can't wait to come back
We were asked to leave after 2 hours
The woman who collects checks in the back room told us there is a 2 hour limit for dinner and asked us to finish our drinks at the bar
We were not informed of this 2 hour limit before we sat down for dinner
Other restaurant rushes you, but The Mermaid Inn takes rushing to a different level; THEY SIMPLY ASK YOU TO LEAVE!! The food was okay
The food server brought caffeinated tea but we asked for no caffeine tea; and didnt feel the need to change it
I will not suggest this restaurant unless you dont mind the possibility of being asked to leave while you entertain out-of-town friends and spend a fortune on dinner
This place was incredible
Staff was friendly and followed up to make sure we enjoyed our experience
I had the trout which was the crispy pan-fried meal of the night
Wifey had the skate which was so good, non-fish eaters probably wouldn't realize it was fish

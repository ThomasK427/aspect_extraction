We ordered the Duck and Osso Bucco
The duck was black and burned, the osso bucco was very salty and tuff
The food was rushed in and at 9PM we were done
That's what they called French hospitality
The bill came to $226
00 (without tip)
I mentioned to the waiter that they rush out people and the food serviced too fast
He appologized and promised next time it would be better
Don't they realize that if the first time is bad, one does not come bank!  Avoid this overpriced French delli!!
Don't go there!!   If you want fast food, visit Mac Donalds
The Scene Since 1981, the brightest star in Lydia Matticchio Bastianich's expanding culinary universe has endeared special occasioners, expense accounters, and food-driven tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of the cookbook author and TV chef in action
As a result, the formal bar is standing-room-only, and two cozy downstairs dining rooms, handsomely appointed with mahogany details, luxurious linens, and sparkling crystal, can feel cramped
The Food The lengthy menu, inspired by Bastianich's native Istria and surrounding northern Italian provinces, is as imaginative as ever
Reliable signatures include three-cheese "Istrian wedding pillows" laced with citrus zest in rich rum-veal reduction; tangy preserved lemon-roasted branzino; and al dente (though often under-seasoned) seafood risotto
But careless missteps in executive chef Fortunato Nicotra's kitchen -- whether overcooked baby cuttlefish, rock-hard focaccia, or gluey gnocchi in undistinguished wild boar stew -- are hard to forgive at these prices
Desserts, like warm chocolate crepes, are simple and satisfying
The food was absolutely first-rate, the service formal yet friendly
Our bill for two with wine was $250 and worth every penny
Very special place with a romantic atmosphere
Highly, highly recommended
I was utterly shocked to see so many negative reviews about this restaurant
I went online after I went there expecting everyone to be raving about it
Clearly many people writing these reviews have no idea what good food and excellent service consists of
I am a tough critic of food and have lived and dined in NYC for my entire life and this was one of the best restaurants I have been to here as well as in any other city for that matter
The staff was so attentive, knowledgeable and eager to assist you in any way you desire
The food was nothing short of sensational and mouth watering
The menu is different and not the typical italian that most of these people writing negative comments are probably used to
If you have dull taste, this is not the place for you
Worth the money
My family and I recently went for dinner at Felidia's and was deeply dissapointed
The food was VERY salty, and the service was atrocious and despicable
When my father is spending more then $500, we would have appreciated a more accomodating staff
There was also a very tall male waitor on the second floor that was absolutely rude
Don't they teach their staff how to pour water or wine? They also gave us the wrong check, TWICE
I have no idea why this is considered one of the nicer Italian Restaurants in the city
I would have had recieved better food and service from Sbarros
I was happily surprised by my family for my bday to go to Felidia's
For those of you, who are fans of her show, I think you'll be surprised by the overall attitude of the service
This restaurant is not good for kids or groups
The tasting menu was good but for the price way too much pasta and few meat or seafood selections
The food was great
The service was poor
Although, some wait staff tried a little harder than others
When you pay that kind of money, you really want the whole experience
And, you don't get that!
My husband and I live in the neighborhood and went here for a special occasion
Although the food was top-notch, the service really needs work
We ordered a bottle of wine a few minutes after we were seated
After it did not arrive and we had started our meal, we inquired about it
A waiter looked me in the eye and said we did not order wine, as if to infer we were making this up
Apparently one of the other waiters had taken the wine order and had forgotten it
We did not mind the confusion, but I thought it was terrible that instead of apologizing, he was challenging us on ordering it in the first place
It would be nice if they didn't have such an attitude with their guests
If they were more gracious, dropping a few hundred dollars on dinner here would have been worth it
I took my boyfriend to Felidia's for his birthday
It was wonderful
One word of caution: beware of the exploding price on the glass of champagne! I ordered a glass of champagne from the bar and although I enjoyed it immensely, IT COST $35
00! Yes, $35
00 for one glass of champagne
I could have killed that bartender when I knew there were many less pricey options
That was the only dark moment on the elegant evening
Oh, yes, the space is cramped but the food made us forget that our neighbors were sitting in our laps
Order the zuppa di pesce or the grilled octopus
Also, we had the pear and pecorino wedding pillows
Mmmmmmm (excuse me, having a moment of blissful recall)
Just be careful when ordering champagne! Yes, we met Lidia and we discussed recipes
For a special occasion, I recommend Felidia's
My family took my 82 year old mother to Felidia for her birthday
My mom is a big fan of Lidia, and we were delighted to find her in attendance
She graced our table with several visits, took a photo with my mom, and signed her menu
Mom was thrilled
The service was impeccable
The food was extraordinary
Great Italian food starts with fresh, local ingredients, and these were found in abundance at Felidia
Thank you, Lidia, for an enchanting, memorable evening
The overall review is on target, but too understated
This restaurant is not cozy; it's packed, and noisy
While service is good; the food compared to what I've had in Italy (Rome, Milan, Florence) doesn't come close
Indeed, not even close to top American places in NYC, Chicago, LA and SF
Surprised that so much of the menu is preped- not cooked to order
Pasta is just ok
Way to many unimaginative stewed items; virtually nothing grilled or roasted
Plating is sloppy
One gets the impression that making money is the key philosopical ingredient, here
Celebrity and popularity don't add up to a high quality Italian experience
Mediocre food covered in overpowering sauces
Were it not for the odd, overbearing staff, it might be passable
When spending upwards of $200 for dinner for two, I expect better service
Upon entering the maitre d was the model of pomposity: Can I HELP you? After being shuffled to a cramped corner table, next to a peculiar pasta hotplate reheating station, we were confronted with at leat 4 different servers, including a very odd, severe woman who immediately read us the specials and rushed to take our orders (not even a cocktail order was taken)
From initial seating through the dessert (we read our dessert menus, one with a large burn hole, and decided to go elsewhere) service was rushed, space was cramped and food was gimmicky
A tourist trap for out of towners enamored of the namesake's show
Go elsewhere
We were taken care of from the moment we walked in
The bartender was delightful, the wait staff was attentive, without being oversolicitous
The lobster pasta and sea bass were excellent
The food portions were abundant and I definitely left the restaurant satisfied
This was truly one of the better dining experiences I've had in New York
Lots of hits or misses with Felidia
The maitre'd was very accomodating with a late member of our party
The service was attentive, but confusing with about three different people attending the table, not counting the busboys

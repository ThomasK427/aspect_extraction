As theatre goers Osteria al Doge is a regular and pleasant stop
The food and service has remained consistently good over the years
The brodeto and carpaccio di tonno was great as usual, my wife had the halibut which was amazing
Our favorite theatre district stop seems to have been discovered by quite a crowd
It can at times be very busy but remains charming
Used to really like this place for pre theater or Birdland jazz shows
THe most recent visit was terrible
Saturday night at 7:00PM and it was a ghost town so apparently I am not the first to be disappointed
The food just wasn't good anymore,bland and not fresh
A 50% decline from previous visits
too bad
We arrived with a reservation to dine before a broadway show
The ambiance is an old world type of charm with subtle music and rustique design
The service was attentive and the wine selection was quite extensive
I was really surprised that this high quality restaurant did not carry Bombay Sapphire Gin, but beyond that the drink menu was reasonably priced
The pizza we had was very fresh and delightfully quick in receiving
The chocolate molten cake presented with style and was one of the best I have had in the city
Great experience yet not pretentious
Osteria al Doge was recommended to us by friends for pre-theatre
Got there a little late but they kept our table
The place is busy and a little noisy but a charming atmosphere
The staff got to us promptly and recommended a venetian fish stew for my wife and a homemade pasta with lamb ragout for myself, both wonderful
The visit reminded me of our vacation in Italy
We shall definately be back and pass the word on to our friends
The pasta is average, the pizza and salads are below average
I try to discourage my clients from ordering from Osteria because the service is terrible, and the person who answers the phone is abusive
I don't imagine they get many return take out orders as a result of this person
Note that if they make a mistake on your order, they will not correct it
I have removed this menu from our database
This restaurant deserves it's high rating
The waitress was informative and pleasant
The specials for the evening included a halibut prepared in a balsamic, lemon and mint sauce
This dish was perfectly prepared and attractively served
The fish was cooked (not seared) yet moist retaining its delicate taste and texture
The dessert offerings were a perfect ending
It is always enjoyable a when everyone around you seems to be having a good time
Not just another Mid-town Italian pasta house
WOW! We had grilled calamares, the big sirloin steak and a lemon tart
All were spectacular
What they did with the accompanying potatoes, spinach, and roasted garlic (w/the steak) was really miraculously tasty
Calamares were so gigantic we didn't even recognize them at first (Oops! What did we order?!) Spectacular
And super-spectacular desserts in an Italian restaurant? Yes! The lemon tart was the best I have had outside Europe
Can't wait to come back and try the Tarte Tatin
Even the music was perfect, a little trancy
certainly not that operatic or retro Italian stuff, and with the volume kept low enough to enable easy conversation
We were just delighted, planning to return again and again
We had to laugh tho when we found they had no 100% Agave tequila
May that be the worst thing that befalls us in NYC dining! We really enjoyed Osteria del Doge
great service, they knew we had theater tix, prompt w/out rushing us, numerous people asking how things were, filling water glasses, bread was great, fish pasta entrees both very very good
Would definitely recommend again! Enjoy!
The food is good, but the service is horrendous
They are not the friendliest of people and can't handle their customer load
I say, go somewhere else if you can help it
This is one of my favorite restaurants in the theatre district because it never feels touristy
The decor is adorable - farmhouse tables, bowls of peppers and olives on display - it's a got a very home-y feel
The food is really good - I like the chicken, salmon and riccotta ravioli best
My wife and I arrived a half hour late for our 6:00 p
m
reservations on a Friday evening but they had held our table and we were promptly seated
The service was outstanding and we were out in an hour on the way to see a show
The meal was great and is an exceptional value for the City
We each ordered pasta entrees, split an appetizer, dessert and a bottle of wine for under $90
00
We will definitely come back!
Osteria al Doge's warm and beautiful setting, offer winning compliments to sensational food
I have visited seventh heaven on several occasions at this mid-town station, and have brought along many friends and collegues to share in the spleandor that is Chef Salvatore Calisi's cusine
The food is authentic and simple, the flavors are rich and complex
The pasta's, all house-made, are each married harmoniously with celestial sauces divine enough for the Pope himself
Bravo Osteria al Doge, dinner at your Great White Way galley is so thouroughly enchanting who needs a show!
Definitely one of the best values in the theater district
we had a reservation and were seated promptly
It was very busy and noisy but the food was great and came hot quickly
Very reasonable prices too
I eat here each time I am in NYC and whether it's for lunch of dinner, the place is great
Menu selection is good and the service is always pleasant although some of the waiters should probably take a lesson in prompt customer service
Only real complaint is the number of tables they squash into such a small area - you get to hear your neighbors conversation!
Prompt and courteous service
My sister and I were seated directly at 5:30 on a Friday night without a reservation
The waiter couldn't do enough for us, including making sure that we were done in time to see our show (which we were, including dessert!)
The food is fantastic, lots of options
A little pricey, but impressive
A great place to bring a date
I'm not sure why the negative reviewers were so hard on this place, I found their accusations to be unfounded
I imagine the one reviewer who complained about not getting a table even though the place was 'empty' was probably improperly dressed (a t-shirt and shorts tourist?)
Some people just can't be pleased, I imagine
But I was
Not only is the food delicious, the staff welcoming, and the atmosphere warm, but Oseria al Doge provides front row center celebrity spotting
Ian McKellan was dining there the first time I visited, and Frances Sternhagen was there last time
In the winter, get the seafood risotto and a glass of red
This isn't just good Italian for the Theater District, its good Italian
period
The Scene At the end of the Royalton's long, visually captivating lobby is 44
The hotel's peak of chic has past; though it retains its fine accoutrements and Philippe Starck-designed quirks, there's a feeling of faded glory throughout
The service can vary widely, from at-your-elbow to nowhere-in-sight
The Food The menu is filled with luxury ingredients--foie gras, lobster, truffles--some in unlikely contexts
Even a simple salmon steak gets a champagne mousse
Beautifully executed standouts include the warm lobster salad with potatoes, truffles and pancetta, tuna tartare with creme fraiche and rib-eye steak with roasted tomatoes
The one-layer lasagna, containing richly flavored oxtail pieces and celeriac puree larded with foie gras, is heavy and complex, though still tasty
We ate at 44 restaurant on Saturday night
Service and food were excellent

Plus they were packed in the restaurant
Great architecture, dercor, scene, etc
However
the server absolutely did not know what in the world he was talking about when we aske questios about the menu, and he barely spoke English
THe food was good
Very tasty, fresh, and creative
But
not as incredible as the ambiance
My fiance and I enjoyed a drink after dinner at the bar, and that was really the highlight of the dinner---enjoying the place itself
Just give the servers a little more education!!! My advice---go for appetizers and drinks with friends
Guastavino's is a spectacular space that largely compensates for OK food downstairs and erratic service
I feel like I am dining in a European cathedral when I eat here
And after all the money I have spent in NY restaurants on inedible food, what comes out of the kitchen here is not bad
Upstairs is beautiful, but the menu is outrageously overpriced and the food is actually better and more fun downstairs
Ask for a table closer to the bar than in back of the dining area; the drop ceiling the back compromises enjoying the soaring space of Guastavino's
Relax once you get there; if the service is a bit slow, it gives you more time to enjoy one of the most incredible spaces in Manhattan
Good place (under the 59th street bridge) which draws a fairly good crowd
I've only tried the food in the downstairs (less formal) area which was very good
Re: the confusion in these reviews
Guastavino's is essentially four totally different things
1: the bar/outside area--mostly for see-and-be-seen afterwork types
2: downstairs restaurant, which uses a different and less fancy kitchen and menu than 3: upstairs restaurant AKA 'Club,' where Daniel Orr is the celeb chef
Finally, 4: after 11pm the place turns into a party with very large bouncers who have to frisk a lot of the folks who come in
A weird transition to say the least
(My ratings are for Orr's upstairs place
)
Ambience is very very good even special, food is so great, people is super and one of the servors looks like Brad Pitt ! lol :o) It's really cool to eat there and people is so so so fun and nice !! GO THERE
NOT BAD, GOOD CROWD AND NO PRETENTIOUS ATTITUDE
GOOD FOR GROUPS AND HAVING A MEETING WITH FRIENDS
I live, and eat out in NY often - this place is beautiful but so-so as far as anything else
The service is mediocre and the food is not very impressive, especailly for the price
Another thing is there is a separate menu for the ground floor and the top floor?????- Why?- I happenened to see the top floor menu on my way in and something caught my eye- well my waiter explained how he coulnt serve it to me and the chefs will get madif he offers it ????!!! I dont really get this but whatever
There are plenty of better restuarants in NY
Guastavino's is a must if you live or are traveling to NY
The place is absosolutely beautiful
It is a sight to see
And the food is just as good
We were a party of 6 and everyone was happy with their dishes
We were seated on time and given the attention that we deserve
Everyone should have a chance to experience this hot spot
I took my best friend here for her birthday on a Saturday evening
Personally, we found the service to be terrific, the food outstanding, and the ambiance fantastic
It was well worth the $130 I spent on 2 people
Its not cheap, but we loved it
We shall defnitely go back again
BTW
I had the Rack of Lamb, mushroom stuffies, and champagne and she had the Chicken with Soba noodles and baked clams, and merlot
I entered Guastavinos to find a friendly staff at the desk and a great food experience
I reccommend it to all who are around this summer
The outside seating area is incredible
I live close by and come here frequently
I have honestly never suffered through any of those horrors I have read about
I find it hard to believe that they would be true
The food is great
The space gorgeous, and waiters are super-nice
Of all my favorites, this place seems the most consistent
Where else can you find so many choices? The outside is great
There are 2 restaurants and the bar
I always bring friends here if I am looking to impress
If you read this, please go and see for yourself
The negative reviews seem a little over the top to be true
Someone either hates the place for personal reasons
or so it seems
But don't ruin it for yourself by listening to them
You will miss a great experience!
Never actually been here for dinner--too out-of-the-way and too cavernous--but it's a great spot for cocktails and oysters outside in the summertime after browsing in the Conran Shop
59th St
Bridge location is cool too
The Scene This charming neighborhood restaurant put Smith Street on the culinary map when it opened in 1999
Nowadays, diners arrive in hired cars from Manhattan, and chef-owners Sharon Pachter and Charles Kiely greet them with the same warmth extended to local regulars
Prices are higher, but there's still a zen-like elegance to the small, pale-green room
Service is smart but startlingly casual
The Food The owners' visits to farmers' markets in Brooklyn drive the ingredient-centric New American menu, which changes about once a month
Start with goat cheese ravioli atop a fan of yellow beets, or a comforting bowl of lentils with fresh poached egg and house-cured bacon
Beware of over-complication: Balsamic-radicchio glaze cancels the subtle flavors of ratatouille-stuffed calamari, and chunky pumpkin risotto with supple duck confit lacks integrated finesse
Simpler plates--like potato-crusted halibut or grilled lamb with artichokes, white beans and escarole--are wiser choices
Flaky, deep-dish cobbler is a perpetual favorite
the absolute best food i've had in years
combination of ingredients is creative yet still allows individual flavors to come out
service was very good, decor is modern yet still warm
be sure to make reservations in advance
Amazing
Amazing, amazing, amazing
Unbelievable food, and fabulous choices of dishes, wonderful, attentive, knowledgeable service-without being abrasive or annoying, gorgeous back garden, the owner came over who was cute as a button and so lovely, and again; you will not eat a better meal in the city
All the delicious food you can eat, and simple elegance as well
I can't wait to go back!
I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion
The food is definitely good, but I left a bit disappointed
First, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them
When we notified him that he didn't mention the specials, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless
Not what I wanted to hear
Secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they'd treat us well for the occasion
they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it
they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end
great experience overall
Yeah, it's that good

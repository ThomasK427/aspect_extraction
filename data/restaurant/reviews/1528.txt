Most importantly, both the house red and the house white are delicious and come in big, cheap carafes
Il Mulino it's not, but for great food and good, cheap wine, Pepe Giallo is worth coming to west chelsea for
Great place to go and have an 'inexpensive' meal with 'cheap' wine, too
DO NOT GO FOR THE SERVICE
YOU WILL NOT BE PLEASED
The food is okay, nothing great
However for one appetizer, three entree's, one shared dessert, and two bottles of white, the bill was a cool $100!!
very nice looking place, but lloks really mean nothing
terrible service
inexpensive, but rightly so
there is nothing special about the food here in fact it falls below my quality standards
ordered linguine with lobster tail
there was practically no meat in the lobster tail, not to mention the lobster tasted terrible
I was definitely impressed with the garden atmosphere and ONE of the dishes that we ordered
However, all positivity was ruined quickly by the service
Our waitress acted very snotty and I am still waiting for extra plates!
Althought the place was cute, the young waitress could have been much more attentive
When a billing dispute came up with the check, the owner said tough luck, refused to adjust the bill which we had overtipped, because they added already added %20 on the bill (which was not listed anywhere in the restaurant, nor on the check) He was the rudest proprieter I have ever encountered that stakes his lively hood on return business
We had 6 people with us
6 people that will never return again
The old saying, if your happy, you'll tell 10 people, unhappy 100 people
I am so far up to 45 of my friends that will NEVER give this restaurant business again
Was the $30 you wouldn't deduct worth your reputation??
this place is very casual, with great food and nice garden in the back
Music was good
The service was a little too lax, especially given the limited number of customers
This space is warm and initmate and makes a perfect stop after a day of gallery-hopping
It is definitely a neightobrhood place (and a gem at that); the service was attentive but casual and the prices are very very reasonable
The veal special was delicious and smothered in artichokes, tomatoes and mushrooms
The side of mix veggies happened to be my least favorite veggies but were so good that I finished them all! The scallops in the risotto special were fantastic, but the half lobster tasted not-so-fresh and was more like a giant shrimp in texture
Overall, the food was good but the wine was the big winner -- modestly priced and of good quality
I've been ordering from this place for five years
Just ordered from them again tonight
They are fast and cheap, but they can be rude on the phone so know what you want when you call
I suggest making up your own pasta with them as well
I get the gnocchi which is AMAZING with vodka sauce and cheese on top
They charge you $1 for the cheese on top
Also the eggplant parm appetizer is great
Sandwiches are ok at best
Salads are very good
Best neighborhood breakfast joint in the city
Try breakfast anytime or the amazing Sloppy Johny sandwich
If you dont know what a great burger tastes like then you have to stop at the skylight diner
Order up a cheeseburger with a side of fries with melted mozzarella and a side of brown gravy for dipping
It doesn't get any better than that
A great place for the whole family
Especially when you know that kids can be picky eaters
Lots of choices for the kids as well as dicriminating adults
Quality of the food is what you would expect in an overpriced fine restaurant and the service is great
Whenever I am in manhattan I make to stop off for a great meal
Since having my first burger there 3 years ago after the car show I've been a regular at this diner since
The service is great and the food unbelievably good
Burgers this juicy are hard to come by especially in Manhattan were the hustle and bustle of it all usually compromises the quality and service expected
Skylight manages to deliver without flaw everytime I'm in there wether it's after the car show at the Javits, a Knick game at the garden, or after a night on the town at 4:30 in the morning
The rating of best diner in Manhattan is well deserved
Keep up the good work
Eating the grilled chicken over fettuccini with pesto sauce reminds me of my trip to my hometown Sicily
Their wraps are mouth watering, all thier food is so good you forget that you're eating in a diner
Not to mention the prices, their food is as good as their prices
and the atmoshere is warm, friendly and family oriented
The service is amazing
very quick
All this put together creates the diner that was voted best is Manhattan
the Skylight
The food is decent but the service may be slow sometimes
I have ordered a variety of things from this dinner and I can say the they have all been good
We have our holiday party catered by them and the prices for catering are reasonable
The only thing about this diner is the dessert, the cakes are not fresh and taste stale, I would not recommend any of their cakes but if you are not a dessert person then this is a good place to try if you are in the area
I went here three times about a year and a half ago
So, I hope that they changed the staff by now
At that time, I only went there because I lived in the area
I just thought maybe it was just that server, which is the reason why I went there the second and third time
But I had three different servers, and they were EXTREMELY rude!!! I've never had any server be THAT rude to me
When I ordered something, they would give me such attitude and made ridiculous comments, like I was an idiot
I've had friends that dined there, and they told me the same exact thing
As far as their food, I think their best dish is their salads
If they have changed their staff, I think this is a good place because their prices are great and the food is decent
However, beware because they could still be there!
I must admit that I really enjoyed my lunch and dinner at the Tick Tock
We were staying at the New Yorker Hotel and it is right down stairs
I had a BLT and it was excellent
The service was good, nothing special, but afterall its just a diner
Looking forward to going back there soon
Drake Adams Roswell, GA
First time I stayed in NY at the New Yorker I found this place and go back every trip, I love their breakfasts but am not really into diner food so have only ever eaten there in the mornings
The service is shocking with miserable staff who don't have any urgency about them, the prices seem average for the quality
I'll be going back next year when I'm back
I ordered a medium rare hamburger with barbecue sauce
It came out well done and very little sauce but the fries were very good
Service was OK and the prices were reasonable
What bothered me was that they added a 20% tip to our bill
I've never seen this done in a dinner
I don't think I'd go back there to eat
The food and the prices are diner worthy, however the service is not
I waited a long time to get my food and eventually my check
My experiences here are always excellent with good service, and subpar with bad service
The backbone is the quality of the food, which is typically quite decent
Another plus is the fact its 24 hours and serves great breakfast
fast, friendly, and really yummy! I came hungry, the price was right, and boy did I feel satisfied when I left!
After reading reviews to this diner, I expected good food and service

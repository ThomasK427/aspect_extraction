We had reservations and still had to wait 20 minutes for a table when it was clear that the restaurant was not busy
We made the mistake of ordering soup which would have been tasty had we been able to eat it when it was served
But, without spoons it was impossible
The mussels were tasty, but I had to ask three times for a mussel fork and a bowl for the shells
It's hard to get condiments
god help you if you want mayo on your frites and the waiter was a little rude
Management was no help
Food is tasty, but if you want good service, go elsewhere
They used to have a really hot curly haired hostess, but i think she left, so there is no reason to go back
Neat eatery in a great neighborhood
The atmosphere was fun and the food not bad, reasonable wine and beer list to cap off the dining and sharing experience
Had the steak frites and loved the frites (thank goodness we don't refer them as freedom fries anymore)
If you've never tried it, have it with mayonaise
it's heart attack on a plate but hey, live a little!
Took some family to this place for the first time, after walking past it on several occasions
The food was good, once you got it
Drinks took a while, and after a few rounds pf the we're sorry, we don't have this bottle sir routine
Waiter was clueless, soup arrived with no spoons (and no soup spoons in the entire restuarant was the excuse!)
All around bad service
Would not recommend
Do as i have done in the past and walk past it
We waited to be seated for about 15-20 minutes for brunch, while it was quite obvious that there were plenty of empty tables right in front of us
In addition, our waiter seemed to have short-term memory loss because he kept forgetting to bring us our drink order even after I asked him on three separate occasions
The steak salad was good, but not at all worth the hassle we had to go through
The first time I ate at Steak Frites both the service and food were great; the second time the food was great but the service was not
The third time, I took friends from out of town and was terribly embarrassed by my choice
Average turnaround time for a drink order was 20 minutes; the food took 30 minutes and several items came out wrong or not at all
I wanted to complain to a manager but did not as I did not want to ruin the evening for my friends
This place has so much potential, but management really needs to work on their staff
I wish I could go back, but there are too many other places in New York to waste time and money on this restaurant
The food here is excellent (especially the salmon, lamb chop, and the fresh bread) but the service is horrible
The runners are phenomenal but we never saw our waiter more than three times during the meal
He didn't even come back to see how our food was until we were 3/4 of the way done! He also left us sitting with dirty dessert dishes for at least 20 minutes
Overall, the quality of the food won us over, but if there's one thing the management needs to work on, it's service
Waiting 30 minutes to talk to your waiter is inexcusable
Enjoy the bouillabaisse - a soup full of stinky salty barnacles
The bread is stale and butter is mush
The frites are horrible, burnt, oily, sad things
The wait staff spilled our wine all over us
(I was just glad she remembered us)
A truly scary place
The restaurant looked nice, we were seated promptly - and then the food came
Adjectives to describe the mussels: chewy, fishy, gritty, old
The waitress didn't notice that I only ate 3 of them
The frites were sort of limp and lukewarm, but delicious in comparison with the mussels
Try Brasserie instead for good french fries! I still don't know where to go for mussels because this was my first attempt in New York and I'm still trying to recover
There are a lot of good restaurants in NYC, I see no reason to go back to this one
I have visited Steak Frites a few times in the past two years and it was good
I visited about 3 weeks ago and the food was better
However, I visited again this past week and had the pleasure of meeting the chef and realized a noticeable difference in the quality and taste of the food
The chef was very friendly and pleasant and I could definitely tell that just within the past 3 weeks, the quality of food increased greatly
I will absolutely recommend Steak Frites to friends and bring visitors in to dine
I hope the new chef sticks around and continues to impact the menu as positively as she has to date
Only been once but was verrry impressed by the burger: very moist, buttery and rich flavor, accompanied by crisp (every so slightly oversalted) fries
Great deal for lunch; came to something like $11 with tip and tax!  Up to now Corner Bistro was my #1, and its still great value but
I am suddenly in love with this place
I read in the post that Erica Miller was the new consulting chef so I tried it out
I was a huge fan of Kloe!! I loved the salmon appertizer, and the Duck Breast was amazing as well
For dessert I had a special peach cobbler! Fabulous!! I have always followed Erica where ever she has gone and I will be coming back to Steak Frites many, many times!! Also, Brian the wispy haired bartender was adorable, he helped me choose my entree and select a wine
Thumbs up!!
There's not a lot more to be said for Frites, other than there's great food (the mussles frites and, of course, the steak frites are delicious), romantic ambience (I like the inside, back in the left), and friendly waiters
I've been four times and never had a bad experience
Definetly worth the price for a great date
The bar is great to for a lunch and cocktail
I really like the steak and fries they serve, well, duh, STEAK FRITES
However, the first time I went I thoroughly enjoyed my steak, but the second time it wasn't cooked as well as the first time
It varies everytime I go
So it really depends on the days I think
Our first choice for eats that night fell though, so we figured Steak frites
Boy were we WRONG!! food was awful, service was very slow
Do not get the braised meat w/ cous cous- it looks like boiled meat bones in broth and tastes just as bland
The cous cous looked like stuff I make at home- NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!
The place was cute, don't expect to be treated like you were at Saint Germain
You're not going to get a Maitre D' that'll wipe the bread crumbs off the table
The prices were okay, but the entres were lukewarm
I was pretty saddened by this fact that my boulabaisse was lukewarm
Anyhow, it was a good American-French cuisine for the money [please emphasize on the American part
] However, I must commend them on the desserts, they were good
Both the Pomme Tartin avec le creme fraiche, and the Creme Brulee
heard somebody ask for freedom fries- aargh this is new york!! This is really the best deal in the neighborhood for french food
Staff is always nice food is good and the prices are resonable
The decor is tres tired though- get a facelift!!!
For a place that is 'famous' for their mussels, I was very disappointed
They were very chewy and fishy
Service was mediocre
There are too many good restaurants in the city to deal with mediocre
I won't be back
yeah the steak is great and all, but the tuna and that sauce-wow- great burgundy at great price- desserts could use work tho- stick with the creme brulee
ouch! ate too much- when they say all you can eat moules frites
well, let's just say don't test em! the lobster broth was out of control!!
I just went to a party there with 60 of my friends and had the best time! The food was on time delicious and the service was great!!! The red wine by the glass was great
while I think the menu could use better appetizers all of the main courses are DELICIOUS- also the service is so much better than the ratings
what's up with that?! Stupid uniforms though- still waiter was sweet and made good wine recommendations
This has to be the HUGEST steak I've ever seen and the value here is OUTRAGEOUS
A big plus is that the wine list is less expensive than most bistros and you also never get attitude from the staff
My husband and I were longing for a paris brasserie and steak frites is just like one- except for the fact that the staff is NICE! Delicious steak and tuna- appetizers could be a bit more varied- but everything else was PERFECT!
Steak frites is the best place for large parties- they don't try to charge you mmore like every other restaurant in New York
No attitude here either, just good service, great food and great wines reasonably priced
This place deserves to be discovered again!
I wasn't in the mood for steak but some friends of mine had raved about their last meal @ Steak Frites

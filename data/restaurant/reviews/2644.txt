A dessert worth missing the ferry for is a dense fudge-like cake that could anchor a dinghy
Every year one member of the family gets to pick a place to go for x-mas eve dinner
This year it was my turn! There is a lot of presure because we always meet in NYC, there are many places to go but not all of them are good enough for such big deal with my family
I am happy to say the Bridge Cafe was better then any other place in New York and it will, I think, be where we go every x-mas eve! Food - Great! Lamb chops and rib eye were fantastic! We do not drink that much, but they had some very nice wines by the glass
Service, they knew how to make us feel at home, and the night seemed as important to the staff as it was to my family
Nothing snooty here
Thank you so much Bridge Cafe and Happy New Year!
The restaurant was a lot smaller than we thought it'd be but it was quaint
The waitresses were really attentive to our needs - always refilling our glasses and making sure everything was ok
The food was average
I had the calamari appetizer, Rigatoni as an entree and Green Apple Sorbet for desert
I'd have to say that the sorbet was a refreshing surprise
For $20 in good company, it was worth it
Off the South St Seaport tourist path lies Bridge Cafe, one of the finest restaurants in Manhattan
Seated promptly, attentive service, excellent food (no, you can't make this at home), wine list with reasonable prices, charming old NY decor, great place to take a date
Very impressive, they have hooked me as a regular
A hidden jewel in the financial district
Civilized without being pretentious
Most diners there had guide books with them
It seems they know something New Yorkers don't
A very nice dining experience all around
We went there based on other's recommendations
The place was not easy to find at night if you haven't been there before
But it is a very cute little restaurant with limited seating so reservations are suggested
Staff was friendly and the food was very good
I ordered their famous buffalo steak which originally would come with homemade potatoe gnocchi but I chose the sauteed spinach with garlic instead, which turned out to be exceptional
It was an excellent sidedish and the spinach was fresh and not overdone
The garlic flavor was just right and it complimented the spinach perfectly
The sidedish enhanced the flavor of the buffalo steak tremendously
The sauce that went with the whole dish brought everything together with the right amount of seasoning and served as the base for the flavors of the other ingredients to build on
It was truly mouthwatering
I went there on a date with my husband and had a wonderful time
The food was great, it even had vegetarain options
The service was also great as was the atmosphere, small not crowded, not snooty, great backfround music and soft lighting
So the food may be well priced for what it is but the hassle you have to go throught with the delivery boys who insist a free coke (just for you) is worth an extra $5 tip
Don't order unless you have exact change and tip
They all of a sudden discover they don't have change after you have given them your money
Don't expect gormet food here, but for a decent Chinese meal or sushi at very reasonable prices you've found a good spot
The ambience is just a notch above seedy and the place could use a good cleaning - or better yet - a refurbishing
Service is fast and accomodating
Try not to thing about what's going on in the kitchen
There's nothing quite as enjoyable as fishing a piece of gristle out of your mouth when you had expected a tasty morsel of double-sauteed pork
From the tasteless egg roll to the not-very-hot or sour soup, my meal wasn't worth the $9
50 I paid for it
I don't see how they could possibly have decent Japanese food when their Chinese is so worthless, but I'm not about to find out
Stay away from this abysmal locale
This is the first Chinese restaurant I've tried in the immediate area
We were served vegetable dumplings dim sum style, brought to us on a rolling tray table
They were pretty good, don't be scared that the dough is colored green
The wonton soup was good but not great
I would not get it again
$3
50 for a small bowl! The Sesame Chicken entree was excellent
one of the best I've ever had!  Overall this is the most expensive Chinese menu I've ever seen, and there was no lunch menu to boot, which means during the day the entrees are still about 15 bucks each! We were in and out in 45 minutes because we were in a hurry
By the time we left at 1, the place was fully packed even though the seating area is very large
China Chalet is consistently good
The service and ambience are very good as Chinese restaurants go in this neighborhood
Large menu
Nothing exceptional, but consistently good food
The Paris is a standby for us since it is reliable for a good meal
Their menu isn't too adventurous, but that's the beauty of it
Prices are a little higher than what you'd expect from this old new york bar but the ambience is nice and comforting so that makes up for the cost
We live in the neighborhood, and we've never seen this place busier than 4-5 tables full so service is good and it's quiet
The tourists definately miss this place, which is a relief
Fish smell from the market is prominant
we went there around 1am(yes, it was late) and were very happy that we went there
They serve food until 2am but open bar untill 4am
Loud and dark but food was excellent
Especially raw oysters and chicken fingers(it's made from thick breast meat and fried in fresh oil
) Around sea food market so smells like one too but if you can tolerate the smell around the neighborhood, it's just great place to eat
But I do agree
Nothing french about this place
Historic site with the original bar
The fish is fresh and prepared nicely
Good for a business lunch of fish and pints of beer
Waitstaff is friendly, food is excellent, and they pull a fine pint of Guinness
The Scene With its wood paneling and red vinyl booths, Hop Shing's interior is pure Edward Hopper
The "No Smoking" sign is the only reminder that you have not been transported to some infinitely more colorful past
An OTB parlor two doors down assures a steady stream of picturesque clientele--the cast of a Cantonese production of "Guys and Dolls," maybe
The Food The families lining up by the counter are there to buy bags and boxes of sweet and savory pastries, including some of the best pork buns and egg custard tarts in the city
Dim sum is served every morning, with a single creaky cart making its way slowly around the dining room, offering simple and delicate dumplings
Get a cup of sweet coffee and linger for a while, nibbling your way into another time
Dim sum in the morning hours
Many locals drop in to get breakfast / dim sum to eat
Usually full of people standing in front of the counter trying to get their orders taken
The dim sum taste ok, if you have a craving for simple / quick dim sum
Though their menu seems to offer alot more then just dim sum
For a quick snack, yes but if your looking for the real tasty dim sum, go somewhere else
Best pork buns in Tri-State area bar none
Also try the Cha shu or beef chow fun, dry style
New Owners
The food is not as good
I withdraw all of my earlier praise
You don't go for the decor, which makes you feel like you're in a real Chinese noodle house
Everything is incredibly cheap and delicious -- even some of the more authentic adventurous stuff
Their hot and sour soup, for some reason, is the best I've ever had
One of the best values in the city, if you can find the place
These are the finest dim sum in the USA
A secret treasure that I am glad is not more popular
The large dim sum filled with pork and cashews is their masterpiece

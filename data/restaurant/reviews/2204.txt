goodness it was excellent had me wanting more
the drinks were a little weak but overall i was very happy
This place was one of the worst restaurant experience for me
Restaurant took the reservation for my frineds birthday dinner and they gave away seats to other people and ended up not giving us a table and did not even appologize
Management seemed careless about the situation and the place is may be good for quick bathroom use
having been to other benihana locations, we decided to quench our craving for hibachi on a recent vacation in the city
seating was prompt, but our waitress was curt to say the least
the chef was accomodating yet somewhat impersonal as well
overall great food as always, but the crew should definately cheer up!
this was my first time at a benihanas restaurant and me and my girlfriends had the best time
the tropical drinks are great, the rice is great, the filet mignon is great, and the show is great
i think that it also depends on who you sit next to and how your chef is
we were next to the funniest people but our chef could have been a little more fun
but i would recommend this to anyone not just because of the show, but the food is great too
especially the sauces they give you to dip your meat into
mmmm
A great show a great food turned my lunch to be one of the best I had!!
I am not sure why the word Japanese is in the title as there's not a thing Japanese about this chain
This food is mediocre and the staff the same
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you

The staff was extremely rude
The coffee isn't worth dealing with them
Avoid this Starbucks

We love visiting NYC, and every single time we go to the Stage-it's a tradition
The food is awesome, service is usually very good, and it's just so New York
For my family a visit to NY without going to the Stage would feel wrong! We love the atmosphere
I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was great, but they've mistaken quantity for quality
I'd much rather have 1/4 the amount of meat with proper sides and presentation
This place was recommended to me by a friend who went to New York
Thumbs up on this recommendation, it proved to be a wonderful place to eat lunch
Wait staff was helpful and friendly
Loved the pickles they give you
Meat piled high to the sky
It was very crowded but that only added to the atmosphere in this great little deli tucked in the sprawling streets of New York City
Best pastrami I have ever eaten
My wife had the brisket dinner and it was terrific also
The service was average and seating a little cramped
But I would definitely reccomend it
As the queue for Carnegie's Deli refused to diminish over the course of a couple of hours, we headed walking downtown and came across Stage's Deli
A short queue, and we were seated
I ordered a huge sandwich named after some actor who apparently selected the ingredients personally! Sandwich was great, and the place had a good vibe about it
It was bustling with character
We were a little cramed on our table, and my girlfriend's burger wasn't that exciting, but I enjoyed the experience
Service was a little slow at first, but brightened up as the meal proceeded
The charge of nearly $20 may scare some for a sandwich but you won't need dinner after it!
Thought I would give this place another chance after a VERY mediocre (I'm being generous) first go
but the service and food left a lot to be desired
Prices were incredibly inflated for such low quality curing
Take your hunger and money elsewhere!

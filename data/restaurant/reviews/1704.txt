Good food
Lousy service
On two occassions, we brought two large groups (15-20 people) to their back room and spent well over $1500 combined
While the food is decent, we were treated horribly
I can only hope the rude staff lives an eternity in a hell where all the service industry people are as rude and obnoxious as they were/
Not only enjoyed 20% off with their discount coupon, but enjoyed their moist and juicy roasted chicken with pesto dipping sauce
Quite yummy! The fries were also crisp and flavored and the outside seating area, although at times noisy from the neighboring playground, was relaxing
Just attended brunch at Radio Perfecto this morning and loved every second of it! The prix-fixe brunch was delicious -- and cheap too!! The outdoor garden was booming with groovy people and the service was quick and extremely friendly! Great tunes on in the bar too! Definitely a great place to go on Sunday morning!
I hadn't been in this place in about a year, and was pleasantly surprised to see the extra space, addition of live music and huge garden in the back
Nice staff, good food, great atmosphere
cool place all around, with a fantastic selection of tequila--what more can you ask for?
ON A WHIM DECIDED TO HAVE DRINKS AT RADIO PERFECTO LAST NIGHT
THEIR NEW HIGH TABLES IN FRONT WITH STOOLS MAKE FOR A GREAT HANG OUT TO JUST SHOOT THE BREEZE AND DRINK
AMBIENCE WAS SOOTHING AND THE APPS
, I HAD THE MUSSELS, WERE DELICIOUS
LOOK FORWARD TO THE WEATHER COOPERATING SO WE CAN ENJOY THE GARDEN
Once the darling of Avenue A, this has lost a bit of its luster recently
The food quality is not as good as it once was, though the herb chicken is still delicious
Just avoid appetizers at all costs
Predominately chinese fusion, although the food does lend elements of Thai and Indian cooking it to, Oriental Grill serves up delicious food in a warm setting
The restaurant is small with simplistic dark wood design, a good date place if you're looking for a small, candle-lit romantic setting
The appetizers I would say are more inventive and sound more appetizing than the entrees
The inventive dumplings, spring rolls and salads sound really apppealing
The entrees are a bit more standard albeit good
The service is ultra warm and attentive
Overall, a great place t try some fusion
nice little place with a great view from the front window
the dishes are really inventive
try the duck, can't go wrong with that
Clean and modern looking with a Japanese inspired decor
Very warm and friendly atmosphere
this place rawks! the music is always something cool, often they play stuff you've never heard before
The wait staff is hot (and they're pretty nice, too, which is always a plus), the drinks are awesome, the value kicks ass and the food is simply delicious
It's not one of those totally gourmet upscale blah blah blah experiences
it's just down-to-earth, homey and fun
Sometimes it gets really busy, but on weekdays, like 9 to 5 , it's pretty easy to get a seat by the window
They're totally gay friendly, and I can bring my vegan friends there 'cause apparently this place has been doing that kinda thang for a couple of decades
my veggie friends really love the food there, and lordie knows it's hard to find tasty vegetarian, even in NYC
Personally, I'll stick with the steak
the brunch offerings are basic but very tasty, and while the service is not the promptest, it wasn't bad, and the waitstaff is friendly
and it's nice to feel you're not being rushed out
and then you can have a walk around tompkins square park to digest!
I've been to the Life Cafe a handful of times and what pisses me off the most is having to bug the waiter about refilling my glass
Seriously, is it too much to ask that it never go empty? That's probably my only beef
better service
I keep putting up with it for the insane meatloaf and mashed potatoes with baby carrots
I finally tried something besides that and ordered the quesadilla
It was so freaking small (but tasty)
Sigh
Back to the meatloaf I suppose
Life is great
Two spots to eat outside, a backyard garden and teh best place, on the corner
Amazing early summer drinks place
Service is fine and friendly and the prices are not bad
Just sit back, grab a bottle of Bud and watch the East Village characters strole by
what is it about new yorkers that makes them feel as though they have some divine entitlement to instant gratification? when i go out to eat, i do it to relax, enjoy the atmosphere, and spend time with friends
that said, it's nice to find a place that doesn't try to rush you through your meal in order to cram in another table-full of people
the pricing is typical of most decent new york cafes, and the food was great
their menu is a good mix of vegan/vegetarian along with some downhome cookin
i tried the southern fried chicken with abourbon sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, and seasoned spinach, and it was all i could do to finish it, and they also have super cheap burger baskets
i'd also have to recommend their seasonal hot drinks
especially the flaming girl scout, yummy and a fun name too
This place is absolutely terrible
Fine, do the on-the-park-and-cheap thing, but at least make a decent drink, or get people their food within an hour
I waited 45 minutes for a simple burger, that was after it took 20 to order it! Try 7A across the way, you're much better off
Life Cafe does make a good Sketchy Kaval Baquette though, try it out
WORST FOOD EVER!!! CAN I GET A REFUND? Will never use this site again
Nothing beats good wholesome food at great prices
Plus this place has an outdoor garden
The tomato soup rocked, and so do their salads
Quick service with a smile
Very laidback
Great spot for a lowkey dinner with a date or friend
I love this place
it is small but warm and amazing for dating or parties
the food is great even though it is not fancy
beware: the place gets full most of time, call for reservation, they will keep it and make you feel like you are in your home
Cafe gigi is not trying to be something it's not -- it is a very simple place with a cozy, unpretentious atmosphere
It is a neighborhood restaurant that would make more sense if in Europe: the service is as fast or slow as you want it to be
When I get the chance to be in New York, I eat here every time
The salads are large with fresh ingredients, the pizzas are marvelously thin crust
I particularly enjoy the diavola pizza with jalapenos and gorgonzola
The prices are extremely reasonable for its location, and having to bring your own wine, as long as you know to do so in advance, lowers the cost even more
I give it an A+
cafe gigi is the perfect place to relax, byob, and gorge yourself full on their huge salads and tasty pizza--good date place if you are looking for somewhere without a whole lot of pretense
and although the service is a little slow, the lax atmosphere allows you to drink and eat away the afternoon or evening and not even care
one of my favorites in all the city
I was seated next to the kitchen, so the blaring Latin-Hard-House-techno music the cooks were listening to mixed evenly with the blaring Middle Eastern pop music the waitress put on
How relaxing for a rainy day brunch! Dying for a coffee, I waited patiently while the waitstaff enjoyed a couple of leisurely cigarettes
P Finally I ordered, but quickly wished I hadn't
The smoked salmon was mealy and tasted of liquid smoke and salt and not much else
The bagel was burned to a crisp
When I paid with my credit card, the waitress was quick to point out, we only accept tips in cash
Gee, thanks
I'll keep that in mind as I run to the deli across the street and get a better meal
The Scene Judging by appearances--blocky blond-wood tables, simple Asian prints and a brightly lit sushi bar that moves at a frenetic pace--you could be at any inexpensive Japanese restaurant in the city
But the crowd, a mix of longtime neighborhood regulars and heavily accessorized hipsters, gives Takahachi an emphatic East Village edge
Service is rushed and monosyllabic, but dishes arrive without a wait
The Food There are three reasons why people love this place: oversized sushi, innovative daily specials and late-night hours
Very affordable sushi and sashimi plates, with requisite soup or salad, stand out from the competition with sweet raw shrimp, smoked mackerel and hefty three-inch-long slices of fish

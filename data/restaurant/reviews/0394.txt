Going out to eat is not just about the flavors one experiences but also about the ambiance and atmosphere the establishment promotes
Dumont has lost sight of this
Really great experience here
We were told there would be a half and hour wait for a table which is always fine with me
I never understand those people who flip when they need to wait more than five minutes for a table - Your out to dinner, relax
go to the bar and have a drink
enjoy your company and soon enough you will be eating
Anyways, after ordering a drink we were told a table had opened up and 2 minutes later we were sitting at a nice table
The service was prompt and efficient, and in terms of the personality of the waiter
I have no clue and it doesnt matter
I didnt go out to dinner to meet a waiter or waitress
The food was great, the wine list could be a bit better but was fine
I will definitly be back again
Having moved near Dumont after years of working close by while living in Manhattan, it's nice to finally have such a lovely place with such great food in da hood
Only made brunch, but been around the menu and everything I've had has been top notch and genuinely cooked to order
That said, their policies are baffling
last time, the waiter told my roommate he'd have to charge her $5 for mushrooms as one of her omelette choices (never heard that at my other favorite brunch places
Paris Commune, Orlin, Diner, Sidewalk) and if you get there later, they're out of stuff (mushrooms, heirloom tomatoes) and certainly do NOT offer to deduct $5 from the bill
$8 bloodymarys are really tasty, but WEAK (extra shot of vodka adds $8)and the seating oddities were already talked about here
I'll still patronize this place, but wish I felt they wanted my business
This last time I went to Dumont my date and I asked if we could sit in the booth in the window
We were told quite coldly that this was not an option since we were only 2 people and that booth could seat four
The dining room was empty save for 2 couples; this was 8:30 on a Tuesday night
The resaurant hosted no other guests that night, as we watched three 4-person booths remain empty through the rest of the evening
Regretably, hit-or-miss service, raised prices (what was once a fantastic stand-by, the $9 cheeseburger, is now $13! and you can't even substitute a handful of greens for fries anymore --shameful), along with an escalating lack of desire to be accomodating in all the ways you would come to expect your friendly neighborhood bistro to be, all stand as tangible arguments for me to stay clear of Dumont
OK, I've been to Dumont a few times now
The food really isn't very good and the service is terrible
Maybe it's that most of Dumont's patrons are younger and have lower expectations, but I cannot recommend Dumont
Admittedly, Broolyn, and Williamsburg in particular have pretty slim pickins restaurant-wise, but Dumont is at the second L subway stop in Brooklyn, and that means when you are there that you are only 15 minutes from Manhattan
Dumont has lost a bit of its quiet, subtle ambiance in the past year
inside dining - still quite lovely
would recommend this revolving seasonal menu over any restaurant in Williamsburg
Sometimes inconsistent, but more interesting, fresh and delicious than most places in Manhattan - great bargain for the price - combination of flavors in any given dish is well-constructed complex
Delight every time
only oddity is those bread strips at the beginning of the meal - often flavorless (aside from the salt) and stale
I don't get it - at least provide some olive oil or dippin' sauce - i want to eat them but am always disappointed
If you haven't tried Dumont - you must make the effort; everyone I've brought here for dinner or brunch has loved it
a wonderful experience - just don't touch the breadstick appetizers - use them to level your table instead
After writing a review that was less than complimentary I must take it back
My boyfriend and I stayed away from Dumont for months because of a bad experience we had there
I still don't think they have any regard for regulars or that there has been any great reformation in service in general, but we had dinner the other night in the garden and it was a lovely experience
Our waiter could not have been more attentive without being intrusive and the food was out of this world
That's the thing about Dumont--the food is outstanding 99% of the time but the service is so hit or miss
We had hamburgers
They were delicious but I did not like the pickles
They had an unpleasant flavor
The outdoor area is lovely, though the wood walls, no doubt erected to please the neighbors, made the air a bit warm
Having lived in Williamsburg for 7 years now, discovering this then out-of-the-way restaurant was a dream come true
The food is consistently tasty, the staff is egregiously helpful, and the ambience is flawlessly down-trodden
The redux of the back yard is by far the most welcomed outdoor renovation in the neighborhood, though the patrons are beginning to reek of self-conscious hipness
Which is palpable, though, considering that this is best food, bar-none, in the Lorimer/Metropolitan area
Our service was excellent! Couldn't have asked for better
We had the wonderful treehouse area for our large group, which was so much fun! However, my husband's burger was really dry and inedible, although the fries, my red snapper, and pomegranate margarita were excellent
We were just a little disappointed in the value


seemed overpriced for the location and food quality
Maybe we should have stuck with this restaurant's best dish, the macaroni! Other than that, it was good
I love Dumont for brunch
The omelets with spinach, goat cheese and roasted peppers is grand in size and flavor
However their dinner menu is skimpy at best and the portions even skimpier considering the price
This still is Brooklyn after all
If you want me to pay $20 for salmon at least serve it with potatoes or pasta or couscous for god's sake
Don't just slap two twigs of asparagus with an once of salmon on top and call it an entree
I understand diets and the need to be thin but when I go out to dinner I don't want to go home and have to cook because I'm still hungry
Skip dinner and go on Saturday or Sunday for the best damn brunch you'll ever have
I *want* to like Dumont, but I've now had two unpleasant service experiences there
Most recently, they took over an hour and a quarter to seat my party of 7
and all the while, they kept promising that we wouldn't wait more than twenty more minutes
When it came time to order, it seems they were out of most of the menu items, and when the food came, the portions were very small
To add to the disappointment after the wait, the mixed drinks were mixed very poorly, particularly my martini, which seemed to be 1/3 vermouth
its more than worth the trip to Williamsburg to experience Dumont
The decor is elegant and cozy inside, and the back opens up to a beautiful and romantic garden
the care and attention to detail here is superb
The food is far superior to the cost, especially the specials
it is creative and decadent, from appetizers to dessert
Try the apple crumble
Everything is delicious
i love the maccheese and the dumont salad!! yum! the back patio is great
all nestled in a courtyard
it's huge and there is a smoking section!
My boyfriend and I went to Dumont for my birthday dinner last night and it was just wonderful
We sat in the garden which was spacious and lovely with lights strung overhead
We both ordered a glass of wine, appetizers (heirloom tomato salad for him, potato leek soup for me) and everything tasted fresh and delicious
We both had different versions of steak and potatoes for dinner (skirt steak with thin sliced potatoes for him, hanger steak with mashed potatoes for me
) Both entrees were extremely well prepared, again, very tasty
For dessert (after all, it was my birthday) we had coffee and split the fallen chocolate cake which is individually prepared and well worth the wait
The bill was a very reasonable 80 dollars
I can't wait to return for another special occasion so I can sample more items from Dumont's small and well crafted menu
I've just recently moved to williamsburg and was so pleasantly surprised with Dumont
I've been there numerous times now and it never fails to please
Of course the food is wonderful, but the reason I keep going back is the waitstaff
I'm so sick of rude, inept, inconsiderate servers! You won't find them at Dumont
Not only are they top notch but they're extremely friendly
I sat at the bar one night and watched them take special care of every single person that walked in that door
And they have a beautiful garden in the back!
Okay, so I've been going to DuMont for awhile now and have always fought the servers suggestion of trying one of the nightly specials
Why fix something that ain't broke? Cheeseburger please
well, I finally decided to stray and I feel like someone finally showed me the true meaning of great food

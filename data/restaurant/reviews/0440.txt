Service was great
A good place for family and dates
I usually go to the Negril on 23rd Street, which I thought was the only location
Some friends of mine wanted to go to the Village location
Cool
It is over priced and one of the bouncers (he has dreadlocs) is rude as all hell, has no people skills and is rude as hell!! When I walked in, it was said I had the option to hang up my coat, so I didn't
During the course of the evening as we all arrived, he harrassed all of the patrons about hanging up their coats
Granted, if you want me to hang up the coat, fine, but DON'T BE RUDE ABOUT IT!! I'M SORRY, I REGRET TO SAY I WILL NEVER RETURN!! WHY? FOOD AND BAD SERVICE
Though, the hostess was cool
The food was great with one huge mixup
My party had ordered 2 large appetizer samplers and three entrees
Everything was brought at the same time and we were forced to eat everything simultaneously before it got cold
When the bill arrived, a gratuity was already included in the total without warning
The server had no incentive to pay attention to getting our order served correctly because it didn't make any difference in their compensation
I really think the restaurant should clearly indicate on the menu what their policy is for including a fixed gratuity in the bill
We had a party of 3 people and a total bill, including gratuity, of approximately $136
This doesn't seem like an excessively large party or dollar total to warrant a fixed gratuity compared to what other restaurants in New York City do
Pros: Food is excellent! Wait, bar and cocktail staff are wonderful! The crowd is really good!  Cons; Very obnoxious fake hosts, one bouncer was a charm the other a total jerk for no reason! Most importantly
HORRIBLE MANAGMENT! DO not come here if you have a large party, they are unaccomidating to big parties
funny, cause it is the biggest bills they have! IF I hadn't already made plans have all my friends to come here, I would have cancelled
Though the food is great, it is highly overpriced, you can get the same dished in Bklyn just wont have the atmosphere
Also, there is no priority even if you have reservations!
I dont know what was it, just a bad experience or this restaurant just doesnt worth visiting at all
Despite the fact that it was semi empty we were told that we have to wait by the bar to be seated
well its a common practice to make people get drinks
i can deal with that
eventually we were sitted, took about 10 min for a waiter to come over
i will be honest, food was brought in really fast but OMG was it bad!!!! i lived for some time on caribbean and this food is anything but it
my chicken was semiwarm and semieatable
i dont reccomend this place for anyone
poor service, pricy and simply not good
If you've had experience with Carribbean food, Negril Village will horribly disappoint
My waitor described the Jerk Chicken as nothing spectacular; an understatement! The chicken was gross! The maccheese that came with it was WORSE- dry, oddly spiced and made with gooey artificial cheese
The poor/unusual taste of the food was worsened because it was cold
Finally, as if the food wasn't bad enough, the service was horrendous, particularly the rude management
I was accidentally charged $9 more for my meal than I should have been
After admitting that the items on the bill were not in line with the menu, the manager reserved the right to price at her own discretion! To top off poor food and service, there was a 20% tip included (for 2 people)
Unless you want to go home with an upset stomach and be ripped off and poorly treated, stay away from Negril Village!
The lighting is soothing, the music keeps a good pulse for your group and the waitstaff are helpful and engaging
We were two families, with the youngest being 15 years old
This is probably not a place for young children
We had a variety of dishes, from curried goat to jerk chicken
Everyone remarked that they enjoyed their food - many of the presentations were equal to the good quality of the food
The recipie imagination was not remarkable, but what you want is what you get
Regret? I got back to the apartment to find a 20% off coupon I could have used that I picked up outside during the day
I had such a wonderful time that I wanted to take a second to review this restaurant
I arrived last night for a dinner party that my friend had arranged
When we got there we met for drinks in the downstairs lounge before dinner
I absolutely LOVED the design and atmosphere of the Rhum Bar
When we went upstairs for dinner I was equally impressed with the design of the dining room
Our waiter was the best
What a warm staff
The food was very authentic and delicious
They had a trio in the dining room playing steel drums
Everything about the place was fantastic!
The Scene More of a high-end eat-and-run scene than a dining destination, Cipriani Dolci draws a well-heeled clientele that doesn't mind the restaurant's exorbitant prices
A glass-enclosed train track runs through the floor of the bar area--the only funky touch to an otherwise staid setting of marble and dark wood furniture
Grand Central Terminal's architectural splendor looms overhead
The Food Straightforward Northern Italian fare rules the menu, with a few traditional American standards such as club sandwiches and hamburgers
Some dishes, like the silky tuna tartare, are noteworthy because of their simplicity
In other places, simplicity registers more as blandness, as in the chicken and rice croquettes and polenta with caciocavallo cheese
The kitchen finds its most comfortable footing with traditional, homey dishes, such as pasta e fagioli and baked lasagna with beef ragu
The service is horrific
The staff, including the manager (except the hostess) were rude, unfriendly and grumpy
The food arrived not hot
It was more the attitude and the unpleasantness of the staff
Finally, we ordered tea which was bought out in a teapot w/o a lid
We asked that they not charge us for the tea since we wanted hot tea and not cold tea
When our bill came they charged us and the manager retorted back by saying well did you drink it and how much of it did you drink
He was pretty darn rude
The staff must follow the manager's suit and be misearable working there or else why would they be so unfriendly and in the restaurant business
Do not dine here!
We just had coffe and dessert, which were nice
We enjoyed the view of the Grand Central from above along with the atmosphere
The service was also nice
We'd definitely go back as well as recommend to friends
I ordered gnocchi and it was SO overcooked that I couldn't even pick one up with my fork without it falling apart
And they claim to be an italian place? The bruschetta was soggy and the panna cotte tasted like aluminum
Was not impressed by this place at all
Even though it is in Grand Central it goes down hill from there
Went with a group of six and none of us will return
You are better off staying at the bar
Want good italian try Grifone or Pescatore
The food is very good, but the experience is what made it an enjoyable evening for us
You sit above Grand Central Terminal staring down on seas of people trying to catch their trains and sightsee
The best place for people watching I've seen in a while
The service and prices are typical of what you'd expect from Cipriani
Well worth it
the service was not good, the food was mediocre!! even the hostess did not come off in the brightest light
i have to say that the location is great, but overall i was extremely disappointed with the whole package
maybe i was expecting a lot because it was cipriani, but i definately NOT impressed
how unfortunate
An impromptu Sunday brunch at Cirpriani was unexpectedly pleasant; grandiose surroundings with attractive staff to match
Alas, if only they could have been attentive too
Sloppy service let down an otherwise excellent meal; the spinach salad was simple and fresh with a salty but tasty dressing
Eggs benedict with smoked salmon was equally fine and the portion was adequate for lunch
If only the waiting staff could grasp the concept of delivering the courses to the dinners at the same time and in the correct order
Still, the setting and the surprisingly reasonable cost offered reparations
The Scene The catwalk, once graced by the likes of Naomi Campbell, speaks to the see-and-be-seen ethos at Meet, though the notable names have since moved on to newer showrooms
A more mixed, less exclusive crowd now lounges on the ostrich-leather banquettes

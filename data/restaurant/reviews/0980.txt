Our waitress and water-dude were attentive (yes, water-dude is a little too attentive - things could be worse) and the hostess was very cool
And the food was really good
Sure, it was pricey, but guess what - supply meets demand
If you don't get to this place, it's not the end of the world, so don't go and expect not to pay a lot and certainly don't go and then complain about it
I was pleasantly surprised that on a friday night, despite not having a reservation, we were seated quickly and without attitude
Service was a little on the slow side, so don't go if you are really hungry or have time constraints
The meal is served in a very unstructured way, they just bring whatever out from the kitchen whenever it happens to be done
The food was delicious but not phenomenal
Beware that you will not be warned of spicyness
Overall it was a satisfying experience, but this restaurant is NOT a well-oiled machine, so best to lubricate yourself with a bottle of wine beforehand
All of the reviews are how horrendous everything is
Granted it is a beatutiful space and the food was OK, just OK
The service always ruins your food if it's poor
The well informed waitress told us about the spiciness of each dish
The first round of drinks we ordered she forgot about
When we reordered our first drinks, we never saw her again
When looking around there was more staff than customers
You might think that meant you would get some attention or a drink
Restaurants make money on BOOZE, guess they didn't teach that to the servers
Mind you this was for a 6:30 rezzi
Beautiful place, hideous service
Never going back
I think the ratings are rigged
I went to Spice Market for Restaurant Week and made a reservation without problem
After I arrived and was seated I asked the server about the special menu
I was told that I had to specifically mention restaurant week when making the reservation and would have been seated downstairs
(Like I didn't have the secret password)
Although that was annoying we decided to make the best of it and order off the regular menu
The food was sickeningly sweet, and seasoned beyond recognition
If you want to charge that kind of money for street food it better be amazing and this is far from it
Furhermore, the service was diner-like at best
The room is cool and well designed but that's not enough to go back
-Great neighborhood, but not in the pouring rain w/white jeans (possibly ruined)  -some hipsters, otherwise nerdy ppl that looked more like tourists, but how cld that be if you still cant get a reservation?  -sat in the bar area and had that menu
Didnt look at real restaurant menu
Plenty of tables avail for no reservation in bar areain case you want to go on an expensive date for not so great food
-food was adequate, but way too expensive and too spicy w/o warning
Even in the gross thai place on my street they warn you about the spicy-ness  -decoration was not my style, interesting and went w/the theme, but nothing amazing
Ok for part of a resto, but the whole thing was too much
-service was totally fine, but we cldve been anywhere  -was more interesting watching ppl come in and out of Soho House
This was hands-down the worst dining experience I have had in New York
The food was only so-so; various table waiters, most of whom barely understood English, kept interrupting our conversation to remove dishes that we didn't want to have removed and repeatedly poured flat Fidji water into glasses filled with San Pellegrino; our waiter was a zombie, took 15 minutes to bring a glass of wine to my fiance, and later spilled that glass of wine on my father's sweater
To SM's credit, our waiter was eventually replaced and the matre d' offered us free dessert, but we're not going back there ever again
The number is always busy - I truly believe they leave the phone off the hook
I was told they had one(early) reservation; felt deceived b/c when I left the place was empty! The only good dish is the tuna tapioca
One of our dishes didn't arrive; the waiter unapologetically said it's special because it's a saute
We hardly saw him during the meal- gave some of his tip to the fabulous busser
My friend wanted to celebrate her birthday there; they told us to call 1 month prior
When we did, they were rude, wouldn't accomodate us
They said they hold tables for repeat customers
I AM a repeat customer!!! But they won't have repeat customers for long! I don't even recommend Spice Market for a drink- go across the street to the Gansevoort Hotel bar for a great scene, great view and FRIENDLY bartenders!!!
I had reservations for 2 on a weeknight
I called and changed to 4
I timely arrived with guests, but was rudely received by hostess
First, she lied and said that SHE personally spoke with me never committed to 4
Then she admitted someone else spoke with me, but that I misunderstood
Then, she refused to make eye contact, hoping I would leave
All I wanted was an accommodation, or a civil explanation
Didn't appreciate being told I misunderstood, esp
from a person that didn't make my reservation
She said, We would never give you a reservation for 4, don't you see we're busy? RUDE!   Went to Vento instead, and were well received, without a reservation!! A place with a hosting Staff this rude, and clearly devoid of any class or hospitality, is NOT worth the trip
I live in the neighborhood, but won't return, nor will my friends
With 6 people staring you down at reception, I felt quite welcome!  Horrible experience, from bartenders trying to pocket the $6 change for a $14 glass of wine, to inattentive and smug service, for sub-par food
The only thing going for this place is its ambiance and potential for people-watching
but it really is not worth the attitude, hassle, and cost
There are so many other places which offer the same within one or two blocks
Simply, Spice Market should spice up their food and give a better presentation of their dishes in proportion to the prices they charge for them
All this Asian fusion craze leaves one feeling like they should've went to an authentic Thai or Indian restaurant for probably 1/3 of the price of Spice Market
The one saving quality of the place is it's decor and some of their drinks are outstanding
Also, this place is always packed, even on weeknights, so, I guess I just didn't get it while I was there
Don't close your eyes-- you may be very dissapointed
I must say that I was instantly impressed with the dream-like Indian/Thai decor, it is truely out of an exotic fantasy
My biggest dissapointment was eating
Out of the two appetizers, two entres, and one noodle dish we ordered for the table there was nothing I would care to eat again
--To sum it up any Pan-Asian restaurant has better food
I would recommend nursing one of their pricey cocktails for awhile and then go across the street for Italian Food!
A group of friends from work and my boss decided we should try this restaurant for lunch
The service was very poor and that is being kind, even though the place was half empty
The food was a notch down from bad chinese take out and the portions were small but not creative or displayed nicely
The decor looks like something best left for theme restaurants in other parts of the country
We sent many dishs back to the kitchen because they were undercooked or cold
The waiters didn't know what half of the dishes were and when we finally did get served after waiting 45 minutes the waiters never stopped by and asked us what we thought
Probably was too afraid to hear
This place needs to clean up it act or even the celebs that might frequent the place will stop going
Went to Spice Market for dinner recently - the place is gorgeous, however, the service was extremely poor
We were informed that the food would come out randomly and not in any order, but there were significant time gaps between dishes so some of us had our entrees for over 10 minutes before the rest arrived
The food was ok, but not amazing
The pork short ribs were bland, the chicken samosas were yummy
The ovaltine kulfi desert is delicious
Went to spice market last night for some dirnks and dinner
Although we were seated 35 minutes after our reservation the service from then on was outstanding
The waiter was friendly and helpful
We chose two or three things and asked him to pick out the rest
The family style was great giving everyone a chance to try the many fantastic dishes they have
The portions were small but out of this world
The prices were not outrageous, but still a bit steep for the smaller plates
All in all a wonderful dinner and a great scene
The minute you enter, you feel you've been transported to a royal south asian market
The beautifully carved stand-alone wooden structures are gorgeous, and the copper uplights add a golden glow to the space
The mojito is excellent, the ginger margarita competent
Amongst the food items, the mussels in coconut broth is good; but the pork vindaloo had with a side of coconut rice stands out in flavor as well as taste

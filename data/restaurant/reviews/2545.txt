Maybe someone should recommend something to order, but I would avoid the breakfast foods, which were bland and a little too much money for the quality
The waffle and bacon I order was crap and the omelet my buddy ordered was filled with crap cheese and tasted worse than an McDonald's omelet
The service was a little slow, too
But, this is a New York diner so I can't complain too much
Ordered and they sent it to the wrong address, hour and a half late
They took my meal back to the restaurant and re-cooked the food and sent it back to me luke warm
Very disappointed with meal and service, the so-called manager could have cared less that I was upset
Try another place, the food is mediocre at best!
Although the ambience is nothing special, this is a fabulous 24-hour diner in a great nieghborhood fot late-nite bites
We recently found this little haven and since then we go there or order in at least once a week
Incredible food! LOVE IT!!! Definitely make reservations because it is limited with seating and you'll have to wait a while if you don't have a reservation
I ate at Sirabella's tonight for the first time and it was so good that it prompted me to write my first review ever of a restaurant on here
The food was seriously amazing (I ordered fish and I also kept picking at my boyfriend's homemade pasta)
The portions are very generous and we could not believe how reasonably priced this restaurant is for the size, quality, and just great tasting food - it really was better than some very expensive restaurants i have eaten at in NYC
Also, the service was great-we never felt rushed at all and the place was packed
Although it is a small restaurant, you don not feel like you are shoved in and not taken care of, the staff was really good and nice
Basically, by the way I am ranting, you can tell that we just loved this place!!
top Italian in the neighborhood
Live far away but will travel for Sirabella's! Try the lamb with Gargonzola cheese mashed potatoes
perfect
Amazingly nice staff
Wonderful food at reasonable prices
Cute, cozy decor
It is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC
First surprise was that even though we walked in to the almost empty restaurant we were asked if we have reservation? During our entire visit only 3 people entered
Menu was very general and did not included prices for beverages and deserts
We've ordered recommended specials: two fish dishes and the duck
Food was well prepared and tasty
In addition to the main course we had two minestroni soups, two deserts, two glasses of house wine, two coffees, sparkling water, one coke
Total bill - $205
00 They must be joking
We will keep this bill as a memoir of the terrible taste after a good meal
The most redicoulus part: Soup -$10
00(each), beverage - $42
00 (wine not included)
I am sorry that even after registering the complaint no one the manager was too busy (doing nothing) to talk to us
I don't think we will be rushing back soon
I find myself craving Miss Saigon every few nights
The rolls are great
Peanut sauce is superb
Herbs are provided generously and always very fresh
The pho is not spectacular but good enough for this hood
Service is always friendly and appropriate
Not bad for the price, but the real pho is in china town
But if you're in a rush, live in the upper east side and want a good bang for your buck lunch special, this is actually not a bad place
I've eaten here for years, definitely blows away any other Vietnamese restaurant on the Upper East Side
Average to below average food
I will not be returning
Sticky rice is one thing - but ours was downright globby
YUCK!
I had an excellent meal and will definitely visit again
HOwever, the portions are quite small but the consistency makes up for it
Service and ambience is comfortable!
I was skeptical at first but the food was amazing, especially for the price
Everything is fresh and non-greasy
When it comes to decor and service it is the typical upper east side restaurant but it sets itself apart with flavorful soups, entrees and desserts
After dinner, the mango ice cream is a must have! Honestly, it's the best ice cream i've ever had
A pleasant experiece with good food
It was not however a memorable experience
Everything is fresh, and of very healthy portions- chicken ceaser is too big to eat alone!- buy for two
I have lived on upper east side and this place is reliable and quick- especially for deliveries
This place has a classic soda fountain--to make a coke, they squirt the syrup in a class and then fill it up with carbonated water, right there in front of you
I haven't seen that done anywhere else
The shakes and malteds are excellent
we ordered a mushroom pizza to be delivered and were most disgusted to find we paid two bucks for half a can of pale slimy mushrooms to top our pizza
what kind of classless place uses such toppings? the sauce was pretty good, but i'd be afraid to order from them again
very good pizza, dough was slightly under cooked but overall it was one of the best pies we have had!
After reading the hype on this board, this place was the biggest pizza letdown i've ever had in nyc
My girlfriend and I, both pizza crazy, went out of our way to go to Pisa Pizza after we visited the MET (its nearby) and we shocked there were any posts on it online
It is just a little above your average, completely boring, bland, typical nyc corner pizza place
A little better than Ray's but with a lot less selection, maybe as good as Ben's in washington square park and not as good as Joe's on bleeker
However it is nowhere near the same league as true pizza destinations like Lombardi's, John's, Grimaldi's, etc
First, I think the high ratings are due to mistaking this place for the pizza place downtown on Houston Street with the same name
Pizza is good but nothing special
Absolutely the rudest people working behind the counter that I have ever encountered
They can give away their pizza but I will never come back due to their rudeness
They won't be making a dime off me
I ask for Pizza's delivery, as usual from arturo, i am costumer for 2 years, and when i recived the pizza, i figure it that it was burned, i call Arturos and they told me that pizza was cocked well done, and the reality it was another one the pizza was black burn
So they charge me and they send me a burned pizza
So if you are looking for Burn Pizza Call Arturo
This pizza is addictive, even the crust
Sauce has a light sweetness to it, so good! It's the kind of pie that makes you think how great every ingredient tastes
Tiny place, so get it delivered, or take your slice just two blocks away and enjoy Carl Schurz Park on the East River
As indicated in another review, this is a hole-in-the-wall -- literally
A few tables and the counter ring the walkway to the back of this place, and if 10 or more customers were inside, it would feel like a 4 train at rush hour
But the pizza's great and worth ordering, whether via the front window or by telephone
And cheap -- a large pie with two toppings rings in at a reasonable $16
50 plus tax and tip -- and I hope they're not reading this so they won't raise prices
Solid pizza at a good price, especially considering it's the UES
A lot of people seem to have this place confused with somewhere else
This is a little pizza joint with no A/C and about 3 tables on the upper east side
Yes they do have excellent pizza, but all the stuff about environment and west village must be about another Arturo's
If you live near York and 85th, you must try their pies
If you live in the Village, I can't help you
This is not a sit-down dining experience
It's just good food
While visiting NY we dined at Arturo's
Best pizza I have ever had
Waitress was great all the staff treated us like family
When friends travel to NY I send them to Arturo's

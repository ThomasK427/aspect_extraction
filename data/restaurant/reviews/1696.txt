Weekends get a bit loud, so daters take note
Also, the left side heaters get really hot during winter, so beware of sitting on that side!
enjoyed the experience
good service
nice feel
excellent food
all in all very pleasant
we were seated in the back side; would have prefered the front side of the restaurant
see if you can ask for the fron side when you make a reservation
Wine bottles are small
really small
order by the bottle
with those small glasses ypou will have 8 glasses for each bottle
other than that everything was lovely
the salad, the sardins, the seafood dish and the hanger steak
lovely
lovely
A more Parisian place is really not to be found
Aside from the suspicion I have that the escargot comes from a can, this place is a fabulous little hole-in-the-wall with absolutely French dishes
I go here whenever I miss living in the quartier latin
I have yet to eat any of the main dishes, but so far the escargot, mussels, asparagus and arugala salads, and pate have all been perfect
My only complaint is that the wine is more expensive than I'd expect it to be
I've eaten here a few times now
The last time we visited NYC, we ate here twice--it's that good
Not just the food, but the place and the staff
Accommodating, friendly service and a relaxed dining experience in a lively, authentic bistro atmosphere
The duck, the steak frites, the roasted chicken--all excellent
As are the sharable pates, cheese plate and endive salad with blue cheese dressing
Ask for a table up front--the back can get a little warm near the kitchen
this place is absolutely wonderful
one of the best little restaurants NYC has to offer
the food is always top notch, the wine terrific, and the service is helpful and so much fun! i love coming back to this place and it's never been anything less than fantastic
If you don't want great French food, authentic French ambience, and an owner who treats the place and its customers as family--in other words, as a real French bistro--then you should bar hop right past this one
The menu, to those familiar with food an ocean away from the notion of Freedom Fries, comprises astonishing recipes from one top-flight Parisian boite to another
If you occasionally miss the city of lights, this is where you can get recharged
And well fed
It's true it's crowded
I would suggest lunch
If Lucien is sitting next to you, there's a fair chance he'll even insist you have a glass of vin on him, because it offends his French sensibility to see you with such food sans wine
Or, if the perfect match of wine and food don't mean that much to you, it's probably a good idea to hop on by
I wouldn't really call this place a restaurant
It's more like a bar with a little corner to sit down and eat
The tables are so close together, your arms touch the guest next to you
The food is on the good side but not so terrific to compensate the bad service, crammed tiny-tables, dirty glasses, overly loud music, which is good for the bar part of the establishment but not when you want to seat down, eat and have a normal conversation at normal volume
Also, despite having reservations, I had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated
The only thing this place is good for is to have something good to eat while bar hoping
The decor makes it feel like a real Parisian bistro; Crowded, crammed tables, dust on the shelves
The food was just ok
Service, so-so
More interested in table turnover than making you have a nice enjoyable dinner
It was also way too expensive for what was offered, the quality and the service
took my mom here last night
It was good as usual, not crowded, nice atmosphere
The waitress was nice and helpful
I had the sea bass, with veggies in a garlic white wine sauce, similar to the broth that comes with mussels
YUM
That was the first word that came to mind
Anti-stuffy atmosphere, just chic and relaxed
Food was so on the money
Foie gras was amazing and intense with balsamic reduction, perfectly seared and oozing on the inside
Duck was flavorful and well-matched with sweet/tart root vegetables
Steak Frites was perfect
I have been to this restaurant at least 40 times over the past few years and I have to say that I have never had a bad meal, in fact, every one was just as delicious as one from the last visit
I'd like to know his secret for consistent perfection
Perfect French food in the perfect French atmosphere
a European friend of mine recently came to visit and we spent more time here than anywhere else in the city! the food was truly melt-in-the-mouth (we had the snails) and the waitresses attentive and charming
Highly recommended
Yes, it's small, but that is certainly part of the charm
Every experience here has been positive
The service has been very helpful in answering questions and very attentive
A neighborhood jewel!
It's a true French cafe- that means that the tables are small, the coffee is strong and a 2nd cup is hard to track down
The waitresses are thin and pretty and nice in their delicate and snail-pace way
The brunch will fill you up but not leave you feeling overstuffed
Not many choices on the menu, but here, you don't need many
When you walk in you will think the staff will be patronizing (Like Casimir) but if you respect their slow pace, you will come to appreciate it on a sunday morning
In Short Once the warm weather hits, a Middle Eastern dinner here can be truly transporting
In the garden--covered with a canopy of red, green and gold fabric--regulars order hookah pipes for the table, and choose between 40 tobacco flavors, including apple, watermelon, vanilla and jasmine
The menu includes baba ghanoush, eggplant moussaka, miniature donut-shaped falafel and hummus
Baklava is available for dessert
I went out to celebrate a friend's birthday here with a fairly large group
The staff accomadated us well
(They even let us bring our own cake for the event, which many restaurants may not allow you too) They food was good as I only sampled so I can't really comment
But if you are looking for a true hookah experience, this place was just not it
The shisha that they used wasn't very strong and even though we ordered two separate flavors, they tasted the same
The staff was truly attentive
They got pretty busy quickly, so you have to be a bit patient with some of the staff
They also have an outdoor area, which is really nice on a warm summer night
i used to frequent this place a while back
until it became over run w/ underage high school kids
ugh
it was TERRIBLE
over-crowded, 17 year old and under kids yelling and smoking and it was just a terrible atmosphere
the hookahs are great, but i don't know if it's worth it anymore
plus, the prices have gone up for the food as well as the hookahs
don't get me wrong, i'm not a prudish-old hag by any means
but this is not the atmosphere i wanted to be in when chilling smoking a hookah
beware
the service is pretty bad too
and watch your bill, i think they add a service charge for the hookah

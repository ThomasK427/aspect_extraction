* Rude waiter - he kept pushing us to get appetizer (after been told twice that we would like to start ordering entree) and after dinner, told us to check out the shelf ourselves on our way to the restroom for dessert menu
* The menu outside their new restaurant is completely misleading
Customers deserve a real, honest menu w/ minimum $30 per person on opera nights
* The food is much worse than the old one
The only thing as great as it used to be was the opera singers
Sorry to hear bad experiences at Taci, in walking distance from us
Ours have been pretty good
Never ordered bottled wine or entrees over $12
Hamburgers among best in neighborhood, pretty damn good
Want to dress up and enjoy fine Italian? Go someplace more expensive
Taci shines at weekend brunch, probably least expensive in the neighborhood and can hold it's own with most in area
Notable exception: Henry at corner of 105th
Supurb costs two to three times as much as Taci
At the plenty of decent, reasonably-priced restaurants in the neighborhood and city you are foolish to order at the high end
Stick with what they do well and you won't be disappointed
For a menu in a similar price range with some similar items, but mostly unique entrees, try the less formal Toast 13 or so blocks north on the same side of Broadway
On wine- asked what waiter recommended and he said if we like red we should have merlot cause that's good for red wines
Umm
Needless to say he knew nothing about wine, at all
The wine we had turned out to be the worst Primitivo I've ever tasted
Then came the opera night
Now this is like dinner theater and it's fun really
The kicker though is that the hillbilly regulars at the bar think they are actually at the opera and take it very seriously
Taci translates to Tackie
Pretty bad overall but fine to get drunk and laugh at people
Stay away from that wine list
yikes
This is like an olive garden kind of place
Thumbs down
Love the music, food, service, and most of all, the atmosphere! I'm not Italian but I felt so welcomed and enjoyed every second of it! The live opera starts at 10PM and you gotta stay until 12AM to get the every bit of the music
Make a reservation a week before for 10PM Friday or Saturday
Entrees are names of the songs they sing
You'll love every second of it!
This is a great place to take a date for an enjoyable night and satisfied stomach
The food has always been great (their 8oz sirlon burgers w/ mozzarella are great) and the waiters are friendly (usually Columbia students), and the owner is always at the bar, ready to assist them
Wine is inexpensive, sold by the glass, and when it's warm outside, they will open up their patio to let a cool brezze come in off the streets
They've got an opera night as well, which I've never attended, but heard good things about
Still rates a #10
Walked in the other afternoon and was recognized (don't I know you?)by their manager Natalie (our last meeting 5/02)
We were treated just as warmly and professionally as the first time
Food and service is just as good
Thanks!
we made reservations a week in advance for a birthdya party
we arrived exactly on time and got a table so close to the door people tripped on us coming and going
Also, smokers lined up on top of us
The place was so packed it was dangerous
The service was best when it was non-existent, otherwise it was downright bad and offensive
The food is third-rate deli food
Buy a CD and order in - don't go to Teci!
There is live Opera here every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday night and the place is always packed
I was neither surprised nor disappointed this place will leave you wanting to come back for more
It is a must to come here at least once
I guarentee you will be back
taci is always reliable and delicious
great environment for italian fare
I can't think of any reason to eat here
The food is the worst kind of fake Italian, bland dishes, the service is slow, and while the singing might be a draw for some, it ruins all possibilities for conversation
I've eaten inside this small, charming restaurant, as well as ordered take-out
On both occassions, I was very pleased
The menu has a wide range of chicken, beef, or pork selections prepared Cuban style
There are even some seafood options, however, I have not tried any of them yet
Further, the portions are filling and the prices are extremely reasonable
The only knock that I would have is that their black beans are little gross
Try the red beans with the yellow rice instead
You also might want to call ahead b/c there are only 5 or six small tables available
Potent drinks, but otherwise nothing stood out
Average food at best
Good genuine cuban/ Dominican food at great price, Restaurant is a lot more chic than the other neighborhood Spanish restaurants
I can't believe how great the food is for such little money! There is a large selection of dishes to choose from, plus an extensive drink and dessert list
The staff is a perfect combination of sassy and sweet, and while seating is limited it is well worth the wait
I have been to both locations
I give a 7 to the one at 424 Amsterdam Ave, while the one at 726 Amsterdam Ave deserves a 9
Food is equally delicious and well priced
The difference is the service and tables distribution; although the street view at 424 is more pleasant
Do not miss the seafood stew and the avocado salad
A very worthy outing
(Do not believe the negative reports: Go see for yourself)
Hey it's really cheap and taste pretty darn good
That's it
Always a fast, tasty meal
The Service is always prompt and they keep tabs onyour needs
The food here was definitely no better and no worse than average
The pricing was also moderate
I'm not sure if I'd go here again
I recently moved out of the neighborhood, and one of the places I miss most is Indian Cafe - I can't wait to go back for a visit! The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, and the food is really good, especially the daily specials and vegetable dishes (but skip the chicken dishes if you like your chicken on the bone and flavorful, since they cater to the American preference for white meat cubes)
The cardamom tea with dessert is a wonderful way to finish off a meal
Indian Cafe generally provides a tasty (if unexperimental) Indian bite but can be uneven
The food can be great but I have encountered some cold, tasteless offerings
The last time I ate there, the rice had the distinct taste of having sat out from some time
Eww
In any case, it is worth a visit
Amazing! Cheap lunch and dinner available
Healthy, great tasting food
I loved every second of it, from appetizer to dessert!!!
This is vegetarian food that even a meatlover like me could love
What I love is that all the ingredients are fresh and very tasty
I highly recommend the yuba rolls in broth and the spring roll which is better than the usual spring roll you get elsewhere
I often get the Simple Palette plate, which is a macro plate
Tonight it was served with steamed greens, pieces of winter squash, black beans, hijiki seaweed, and the grain was sweet rice with millet and cauliflower
I've had fish there also - very nicely and simply done

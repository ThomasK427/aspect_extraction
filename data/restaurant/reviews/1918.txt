The pastas are excellent as well
The pizza is hot, it's not greasy and the slices are big
They are the thin slices and not the thick crust but that's how I like my pizza
Whenever I'm in the Village and need a snack this is the perfect place
If it's a nice day you can sit outside
In the back is an outdoor fenced in area
I can't remember the price for a slice but I remember it being relatively cheap compared to other NY pizza joints - maybe $1
50/slice and no more than $2
GREAT pizza!!! Yummy after you have been drinking all night! We got a huge cheese pizza for $12! Great deal
Can't wait to eat there again!
I have been here several times over the last 5 years and while the food remains delicious, I have noticed a significant decline in the level of service
While the service was friendly, it was extremely inattentive
On my last visit, I had to get up to look for the waiter several times
Maybe I'll try the Chirstopher St
location
As the other reviews stated, this place definitely does not know how to do their math
So be warned and be cautions when paying the bill
Other than that warning, the fries and muscles aren't anything different that what you can get at that frites place on 2nd Ave, but they do have a decent beer selection
Just make sure you drink responsibly and make sure to bring a designated bean counter for paying the bill
Apparently in Belgium they use a different sort of math
The kind where a $21 check, paid with $30, only gets $7 change
The frites weren't worth the two buck surcharge
We went to The Belgian Beer Bar and it was a good time until the bill came
when we got our bill it stated that $43+$3 = $47, we decided to ignore the extra dollar! Then we got our credit card reciept and they went ahead and charged us $49!!!! Must be some new math!
I'm here for lunch 3 days out of 5
The service is excellent, the fish is extremely fresh, and they have the more decadent cute of tuna (toro), and yellowtail
Nice selection on Sake, and VERY modest prices
Expect a small wait on friday saturday nights
A+
Marumi is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in NYC! I visit it on average once a week
The fish is always fresh and delicious and the price is right
I would highly recommend the Tuna-Avocado salad!
i've been coming here for the past 4 years
everytime it's never been a disappointment
The nabeyaki udon is always fabulous, although their quality has a suffered a little in the past year
maybe it's just me
i will still go there
sapporo east in the east village is another good valued restaurant
Marumi lovers constantly crave for that spicy sashimi salad
I don't know what ingredients they put in there but it lures me back there all the time! Everyone must try their spicy sashimi salad
And their soy sauce, it's just different in a good way
i love marumi! my favorite sushi place in new york as well! great value for great food! =) gotta try their spicy sashimi salad and if you're a UNI fan
it's really fresh and yummy there
get the mini-chiirashi with UNI
Marumi is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the city, hands down
While there are other Japanese restaurants with better food, Marumi has the delicate balance of high quality food at a reasonable price
Tempura is lightly battered and crisply fried
Sushi fish is sea fresh
Service is attentive and friendly
And the decor is bright, clean and calming
I highly recommend this Japanese restaurant - I visit it at least once a week
That's funny -- *I* was going to say my favorite sushi in NYC, too
No joke: I've been coming here for 6 or 7 years, and I've never, ever had a bad meal
Super-fresh fish and great value
No long lines like other places, and no size overload, just a good, fresh, honest piece of fish
Try two mini-chirashis for a wonderful, simple meal

I had a great time here last thursday night we were greeted promptly and our server kirsten was really really on top of us she kept the margs flowing
we had a blast me and my 4 friends cant wait to come back
they have soem crazy happy hour at the bar,,,and they offer $ 1 miller lite drafts all day and nigt
i cant wait to get a buzz on for $10,,,lol,,,we didnt eat much
(not smart) but what we did have was yummy
overall great time
cant wait to head back
Obviously the food is straight from the microwave, but the most ironic part of the name is 'Celebrity Hangout'
not even Carrot Top would want to be photographed eating here
We happened upon Swanky's just by walking down Bleecker St looking for a drink and a bit to eat
The outdoor seating lured us in and I'm glad it did
We were served by a courteous waitress who brought us our drinks on time and in a friendly manner
We had a couple of appetizers which were quite tasty
The outdoor seating was perfect as the corner location made it great for people watching
basically, this is a cool place to hang for drinks eats
If have been once to the uptown location and once to the downtown location
Both times I felt the food was simply up there with some of the worst I have ever eaten
This is easily the worst mexican joint in New York City
To add insult to injury, the dishes are priced to high, and the margaritas are $11
00
I had a burrito once, and a chimichanga once
My four freinds and I were in the village on friday night
and decided on mexican
now we live on the upper west sdie
and know Swanky's up there is great
so when we saw Swanky's in the village, we had to go in
and as per the usual Swanky did not dissapoint
the maragritas were as always delicious and the fajitas (I always have the steak fajitas) were yummy as usual
an overall great time was had by all
now whether uptown or downtown
Swanky has got it covered
Place was empty, waitress was rude, told us that even though there were drink specials at the bar (2 for 1 margaritas), we couldn't have them at our table and we couldn't go up to the bar to get drinks
When I dared to ask what kind of chicken was on the taco salad (white meat or dark meat) I received an annoyed look and was told it looks like beef
Should have changed my order
My salad looked like they opened some canned chicken, plopped it into a tortilla shell and threw some guac and sour cream on it
Disgusting
My friend sent her soup back
Soup? Are you kidding me? The waitress conveniently added in her tip into our bill, charged $10 for each margarita
Gee, think she didn't want us at the bar with drink specials so she could make a bigger tip on a larger check?
Nothing good to say
Rude staff, lousy food
The place was practically empty when my friends and I got there for dinner
The staff were all partying with each other at the bar, so even though we were the only ones there for food, it took 15 minutes to get menus

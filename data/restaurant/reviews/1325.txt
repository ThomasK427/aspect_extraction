The $5 edamame, a HUGE pile, so worth the money
I've fallen in love with the cod, lima bean and peas dish
All servings sizes are perfect, and taste just like the menu describes them
Haven't had the mixed grill yet, but it always looks good when they serve it up (advantages of sitting near the chefs)
One of the best drinks I've had all summer was served here - cherry-sake-sangria
So refreshing, better than most mojitos! Dessert is perfect! Enjoy!
the pizza is great but my favorite thing to have here is the Nutellatini - Mike makes them the best! the first time i tasted it, i was hooked
i go at least once a week to have a drink
I LOVE MIKE (THE BARTENDER) AND HIS NUTELLETINI'S!!!!!!!!!! IF U HAVEN'T TRIED ONE YET
GO NOW!!!!! U WONT REGRET IT!!!!!
What a fiasco! We went there for lunch one day and waited 45 minutes for a pizza
At that point, I went to the manager to complain and he basically said that's the way it is during lunch
Customers seated after us got their food and were almost finished
Worst part is the manager was totally unsympathetic and said If you don't want to wait then leave
We left
Too bad, the pizza is some of the best I've had but the service is worse than poor
Waiters and waitresses are indifferent and somewhat rude also
They are probably taught by the manager
Anyway, avoid this place if you're looking for decent service along with your meal
So, I was pretty excited to try the pizza from Adrienne's after hearing some hype about it (relation to Nick's, etc
etc
)
I have to say, after just finishing my last piece? I wasnt impressed AT ALL
I went the delivery route since I live literally a two minute walk away and I thought surely that would be just as good as eating there
Nope
It took over an hour to deliver it, the pizza was cold, the crust was inedible (hard as a rock and not in that good crispy crust way), the slices were all sorts of variety of sizes and the taste? wholly mediocre
It seems they wanna be like Lombardi's based on their style of pie (the classic personal pizza is what I got) but they are FAR from it
I honestly think I've had frozen pizzas that were better and that's really saying something right? I essentially ate it because I had paid for it and because I was starving
Disappointing, less than enjoyable
Maybe if you go it will be different, but I think I'll stick with all the other pizza joints in the city that are actually good and worth the price
Happy eating
If you haven't been to Adrienne's, I highly recommend the downtown getaway
The location is fantastic; it's like having dinner at an amazing little Italian Bistro that only the locals know about
And that feeling follows you through the door, where you are welcomed by the friendly staff
Say hello to the manager, Jason
he makes you feel right at home
Return a few weeks later, and he'll welcome you like an old friend
We were introduced to the best Pomegranate Belini's in the city - courtesy of Mike the bartender
Not a Belini fan? Have him concoct something that makes your mouth water
Richard is a new addition Adrienne's
we already love him
My friend and I were on Friday night walking by Pearl street and we saw this pizza bar
We stopped for a quick check and we end up having a best time and pizza ever
Barese pizza with onions, susage and fenel was abosulutly great
Nutela Eclair was one of the unique dessert that I had for a long time
Service great and quick - very friendly - cool people
Music was calm and smooth
Definately going back sometime
I went with a coworker at lunch, and ordering a slice is a nerve wracking experience
You can only order what is shown and the pizza chefs are downright surly
I understand that a city with foie gras in burgers is used to sanctified pretentious food, but I still enjoy a normal slice once in a while
The food is good, but the pretentia is smothering
My cousin and I went to grab a drink on Stone Street and came across Adrienne's Pizza Bar
The ambience gave us a nice cozy warm feeling
We had a couple of glasses of wine, shared the margarita pizza (excellent!), and the bruchette
We loved it
The service was friendly and attentive
Great new downtown spot! Definitely going back
Highest recommendation! Eat at a hot spot during the week or relax and get away from it all on the weekend
Adrienne's Pizza Bar is our new favorite restaurant - best food/value
Hard to believe you can crave salad until you've tried the Arugula salad with sun-dried peppers/tomatos
Two of you? Order an Arugula salad, two pizzas and two glasses of wine ($55) - nice date
You'll want to come back within the week
If they delivered to Battery Park City, it would be tough not to order once or twice a week
Part of our Saturday routine, if we miss lunch, we go for dinner
I have been to this cafe for a breakfast and enjoyed with it
The cafe is interesting (half a boutique and half a cafe) and the food is simple yet delicious
202 is a lovely little find-- a great atmosphere (half shop, half restaurant), wonderful service, and really delicious food
the menu is limited and the food is simple, but dressed up enough to make it stand out (the tuna burger is stellar)
the waitstaff was so pleasant and attentive but not overbearing
i would come back here in a heartbeat
Try the tuna burger it's glorious
The service was impeccable
Friendly staff, well organized and well managed
I went for Sat branch and truely loved it
The tea selection is commandable
I highly recommend it
On a whim, I sat down at one of the old antique wooden tables for lunch at 202 in Chelsea Market
I ordered a special: Grilled shrimp and preserved lemon risotto with chiffonade of basil and fat curls of parmigiano reggiano
The meal was exquisite--just the perfect portion and my server was attentive, but not overly attentive
I ordered a cup of hot tea after my meal and read a book for an hour
The tea came out in a fancy french press
I am looking forward to another visit soon
GREAT FOOD
GREAT SERVICE
THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE HARD TO COME BY IN THE NYC RESTAURANT SCENE BUT 2O2 HAS IT ALL
ITS SO NICE TO NOT DEAL WITH PRETENTIOUS ASPIRING WHATEVERS WHILE TRYING TO ENJOY A GOOD MEAL
THE STAFF IS SO FRIENDLY AND THEY ALL HAVE THERE ACT TOGETHER
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY BRUNCH IS BOOMING AND EVEN WITH A NO RESERVATION UNDER A PARTY 0F 6 POLICY YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DRAMA JUST WALKING IN AND MAYBE WAITING A FEW MINUTES FOR A TABLE
I TRULEY HAVE FOUND MY FAVORITE NEIGHBORHOOD PLACE FOR 2006
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AND WILL BE GOING BACK QUITE FREQUENTLY
I arranged to meet with a group of friends for a drink last night at 202
Having sipped on the seriously good cocktails we decided to stay for dinner
The menu offers a short but varied choice of dishes plus there is a list of daily changing specials
I had the steak last night which was cooked as I requested, which I must say doesn't happen very often in restaurants
The meat was tender and juicy and came with delicious 'bubble and squeak' - an English dish of fried potato and cabbage
My friends ordered various dishes from the menu and everyone was raving about the food
The service was extremely friendly and efficient and was made particularly entertaining by our server, Maria
I shall be back to try brunch next week when my folks are in town
I read great reviews of this place in the Times and New York magazine, and so I decided to try it out when my mom and a friend of hers came to town

Fnally tried Esca with a group of six before the theater
We were not disappointed
Service was top notch and so was the food
Be sure to try the a la carte vegetable assortment with the meal
Also enjoyed the italian digestiv and Turkish press coffee
The group agreed, though a bit pricey a memorable experience
Rude service, so-so food that was too complex for its own good, boring decor
Maybe a drink at the bar at best
There are no words to describe the experience my wife and I had at Esca
The waitors were skilled attentive
The taste from the anchovie salad was like an explosion in my mouth
The pasta with walnut pesto fresh sea scallops was perfectly al dente
Try the swordfish
We left the restaurant wanting to cry because we knew we'd never have a meal like that again
Mario B, my wife wants to have your baby
Thumbs way up!
best seafood in ny
better than babbo
this is real italian food
In town on business, I was dining alone
Instead of waiting for a table, I decided to eat at the bar
The bartenders made me feel welcome and my service was courteous and prompt
A great experience overall
I dined at Esca, thinking that it would be as good as Mario Batali's Lupa and Babbo--big disappointment
The food was average at best and way over-priced
Nothing special here
By the way, Esca in Italian means bait--Is Chef Batali suggesting what the food is good for?
Tried the taster's menu again with the wine pairings - the toro was incredible, almost like filet mignon in its many presentations
Three of the four wines were pleasent, nothing to scream about but the fourth one was rich, robust and a perfect match with the toro
Went by myself so I had to eat at the bar with about 10 other single people - which turned out to be really enjoyable
I'll be back next month being that the menu changes daily
I can't understand the hype about this place
I went there once and vowed never to go back due to the careless and downright rude attitudes of the waitstaff
The vow never to return was broken when friends invited us to dinner and chose to go to Esca
Alas, our experience was no better than the 1st time and our friends have likewise vowed never to return
It's a promise we'll all keep this time
Why pay through the nose for a bad experience?
Because that's the only way Citysearch editorial (though we KNOW you're not food critics) could make this the best seafood in Manhattan!!! Now, Mario is a terrific guy but as a chef he has really faltered with Esca
The prepaprations are fussy, with too much going on
except good cooking
The fish gets lost in the stuff around it and apparently this is supposed to cover the fact that the fish is never cooked properly
A sad state of affairs for a fine chef
I was very disappointed with Esca
The food, while solid, was unspectacular and the pricing was outrageous
As a first course, I had linguine with clams, prosciutto and red pepper (for $22!)
The dish was basically linguine in oil with a few clams on it
The only flavor present was the oil
I can have better linguine at almost any neighborhood italian restaurant for half the price
The fish was very fresh and well-prepared but not to a degree to justify any higher prices than at many italian restaurants
There are too many good italian restaurants around to waste your time and money here
Esca always seemed a wee bit pretentious, but a friend insisted that we give it a go, so four of us went there for dinner
Since he was going to pick up the tab, I figured what the hell
What a mistake
Three of us got ill after that meal, and we all got different things
While dining, none of us were impressed with the food
I'd never go there again
It's overrated
Great food Great Chef Raw bar at the bar is fantastic
The crudo is delightful
Gnocchi competes on par nona's best
San Pietro fish is wonderful! Service is top-notch
Easily one of the best places for pre- or post-theater dining
Crudo, an appetizer with 3 pieces of exotic raw fish covered in citrus infused olive oil, will stay with me for a long time
The menu is filled with interesting local ingredients: instead of salmon, line caught salmon from ___ river
The fish entrees come to life and the deserts were delicious
The waiters were attentive and happy to expound ala Molto Mario about any of the dishes
I'll definitley go back
We had a reservation for the garden
By the time we got to the restaurant, it was very windy
The restaurant was very accomodating when we asked to be seated inside
The appetizers, a cured tuna and a raw fluke with a radish salad, were outstanding although very, very small
The entrees were simple
A swordfish that was cooked about 2 minutes to long, served with green beans and oven roast tomato, and a bass served with braised fennel were great
Sorbet and strawberries for dessert was a great ending to the meal
We left full, and it reallly wasn't that expensive
We recently went for dinner with two kids and the staff were very accomodating even without reservations
The food and wine were excellent and the staff were so attentive
It was one of the best meals we've had in the city
I loved the mushroom salad and the cerviche was extaraordinary
Will definitely go back to try the tasting menu
The food at Esca is an accomplishment and the kitchen staff can be proud
Previous patrons remarked that they were seated buy the noisy bar
Surprise, we were seated beside the bar
Thankfully, our corpulent host rectified the situation
Esca should not use advance reservations as an opportunity to fill up their worst tables
The interior was uninteresting
The heavily up sold $30 per person Crudo tasters plate is laughable
Does sushi become exponentially more expensive when you poor olive oil on it? We enjoyed the sea bass in salt crust
Thankfully, the whole fish survived the mangling it underwent by the wait staff
They de-boned the creature in the restaurant for our viewing pleasure
It was comical; three people hacked away for several minutes in a futile effort to display dining panache
Curly Moe would have been proud
We were planning a lunch for a good friend and wanted to find a place that was nice, relaxed and away from the craziness of our Times Square office building
Esca turned out to be the perfect answer! They accepted our reservation a month in advance and then accommodated our group of 11, then 14, then finally 12, with a smile
The food was delightful as always but, in a situation where service was really going to shape the experience, the staff really came through and made this a wonderful low-key celebration
The Scene Since 1999, Babbo's loveable (and much less expensive) little cousin has been going like gangbusters
The candle-lit bar is the destination of trendy wine-sippers and snackers, and the rustic-chic dining room, with brick arches that open onto a tight sidewalk terrazza, is booked weeks in advance
Expect to wait, even with reservations; once you're seated, service is knowledgeable and friendly
The Food Chef-partner Mark Ladner has found his stride with this robust Roman menu
Gratis rosemary focaccia finds no better match than his inspired antipasti: truffled radiccho with herbed breadcrumbs, squash-onion caponata and sweet-sour sardines arrive in deep little bowls

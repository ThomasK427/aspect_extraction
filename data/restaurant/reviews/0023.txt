Accomodating staff
Try the filet
the food is good and inexpensive
the wait staff was helpful
the atmosphere is nice
maybe one too many of the beautiful people there
If you want to try french food, this is a cheap place with a nice ambiance
Romantic garden at the back
i went when it first opened years ago and it was GREAT
been there recently and it's horrible-the food was so blah
the french onion soup was soooooo salty and i told the waitress and she just stood there with this look like:well
what do you want me to do about this? not mean or anything but hello! why don't you take it away and offer me another one or something else
But i also seem to have been disturbing her intimate/physical relationship with her male friend who was seated at the next table outside in the garden
The food is fresh and delicious
The wine, wonderful
Casimir is a great getaway on the east side
Fun atmoshpere for small parties
Have dinner and stay for drinks
This is one of our favorites in the winter
I really recommend coming here for brunch
The omlettes and french toast were to die for
And you can't beat $4 profiterole rolls
The ambience was lovely, like a corner french bistro with a Moroccan touch
I see that some others reviewers were complaining about bad service, but I have to say that our service was very nice and attentive, with no signs of the rude management
So my advice is come for brunch
The added bonus: it's quiet and you'll be seated right away!
I must admit, though I have never been the object of it, I have observed consistently rude (sometimes even appaling) behavior mostly from management
These guys don't care about their customers
I don't even think they care that much about the food
It's about getting your money people! It's hip and cool and even though they have more attitude than all the bistros in NYC combined it's still scarily popular! And the food isn't even that great
Medium rare, tender, peppercorn sauce, and only $16
I come back for it (or the salmon) about once a month
Great ambience
Last night I brought friends from out of town and all of our entrees were delicious
Our waitress was exceptionally friendly and attentive
This place is WAY OVER
Why pay to be ABUSED? They seem to really be into degrading their customers
Someone should remind them that they are in the SERVICE industry
Maybe they think they 'obnoxious' is in? Who knows, who cares
If you want the real thing with real service, try Le Gamin on 5th or Belmondo's across the street, but do yourself a favor, don't waste your time or money at Casimir
So many other places in the neighborhood are so much more deserving
And authentic
The clincher was when my friend mentioned to the manager that we had a problem, before even mentioning what it was, he said let me guess; you didn't eat your entire meal and don't think you should have to pay for the whole thing
What??! When she mentioned the above problems (and left out the fact that our waitress was rude and condescending), he told her she didn't know what she was talking about
As we were leaving he started to berate another guest in our group, saying things like do you ever eat out in restaurants? This man appears to have a serious hostility problem
The food is just ok, not at all worth having to put up with the disgusting staff, the manager/owner in particular
It's a shame you can't even sample the food or sit in what is a very nice space
The host/maitre d is so unapologetically rude that it's not worth even walking into this place
If you're looking to be berated and talked down to, this is your spot! The ownership of this place needs to realize that there are thousands of restaurants in Manhattan and people have a choice of where they eat
There are a lot better restaurants with far less attitude
Don't bother!
The Scene Tucked away on the second floor of a small, nondescript Madison Avenue building, Caviar Russe feels more like a private club than a restaurant
The room is a shrine to turn-of-the-century Russian opulence, boasting heavy crystal chandeliers, plush green velvet walls and cozy banquettes
The Food The culinary offerings are just as decadent
As you'd expect at a joint owned by one of the most prominent caviar importers in the world, fish roe is the star of the show
But should you wish to diversify, you can indulge in the eclectic menu, rich with such delicacies as Maine oysters with beluga and sake and miniature lobster profiteroles stuffed with sweet tail meat
To wash it all down, choose from an impressive selection of global vodkas and vintage champagnes
I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons
Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys
The tastes makes your mouth water for more
Waitstaff is great, very attentive
Wine list is not huge but def well selected
I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon
Not only does Caviar Russe have (in my opinion) the most incredible quality and choice of caviar in the town (and I've been to Petrossian and Caviarteria many many times), the sushi is out of this world
Add to that the incredible and knowledgeable service, and you have a place that is definitely not to be missed - for locals and tourists alike
Can't say enough about this place
My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent
From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it
Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service
I was looking for a special place to celebrate myhusband's birthday
When we first arrived the lady at the counter asked for our names and immediately wished him a happy birthday
We had reservations and we were seated right away
Another gentleman we came across wished him a happy birthday as well, and so did the waitress
A small detail but it was impressive none the less
It was romantic and you also have the option to eat in the elegant room
The service was first class and so was the food and wine
I am a big seafood fan and the sushi that I had was probably the best that I have ever tasted
I highly recommend this place for any special occasions
I took my wife there for our one year engagement anniversary
I rented a helicopter to propose to her, so I was looking for something that would do justice a year later
We both love caviar
Caviar Russe was an excellent choice; the service - perfect, unobtrusive and efficient
The china was excellent and did justice to the caviar
The lobster for two was fresh and the appetizer Komodo oysters outstanding
If you take out the caviar, Caviar Russe was a good value, but the caviar stands alone
The view onto Madison was romantic and the ambience has that prerevolutionary decadence to it
We will be back
My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary
We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments
We were not disappointed
The food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing
Somewhat pricey but what the heck
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady
Went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here)
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses! Great people watching as others do the same to you
Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays!
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date
The place was quiet and delightful

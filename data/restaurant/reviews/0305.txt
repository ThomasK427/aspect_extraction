I will never recommend this place
Ollie's provides tasty and quick chinese dishes, with enough choices to please the pickiest eater (including vegetarians!)
It's a popular pre-theatre spot, and is usually pretty crowded so don't expect a quiet place for two, but it is delicious and quick
With rotating discs on the center of the larger tables (allowing for you to share dishes), hanging ducks, and a cheerful decor it's definitely a place you should stop while visiting the Times Square area
I recommend the vegetable won tons and the sesame noodles, but you really can't go wrong with anything, and it's not overpriced
This place is good if you want a no frills no wait pre-theater dinner
The food is surprisingly good and comes out in about 5 minutes
The service leaves a lot to be desired, they are fast but not at all friendly
Our waitress kept zipping by our table and we barely got out our order before she ran away
We asked the hostess for a booth and she said they were for parties of 4 not 2, and then proceeded to seat a pair there not 10 minutes later
Overall - a good experience
I have read many of the reviews stating poor this or poor that! We were in a hurry to grab a quick bite to eat and decided to take a chance w/Ollie's
All in our party were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food service, including a very picky vegetarian friend! I wouldn't rate it as highly as many Chinatown places, but all in all, this is a great place right here in Midtown! Definitely would go back again and again!
The Scene Sweet-n-Tart features three floors, each manic and hyper-efficient: Imagine an IHOP designed by John Woo
Families tend to congregate on top (where, for a dollar extra, you get linen tablecloths), and Chinese hipsters hang out in the soda fountain-like basement
The Food "Something for everybody" is usually a concept that pleases no one, but this hopping Hong Kong-style eatery gets it right
Navigating through the three menus, you'll find Cantonese classics, cross-cultural borrowings (Thai, Japanese and coffee shop continental) and unique creations that exist here alone
You can order a selection of small dishes (unlike conventional dim sum palaces, the kitchen here turns out great fried stuff), grab a quick plate of noodles or a milkshake, or you can assemble a banquet
Missteps are rare: Simple plates of greens and complex casseroles are equally flavorful and focused
My all time favorite at this place is the 'watercress dumpling in japenese ramen noodles'
The wontons are quite good --substantial and nearly bursting from the wonton skin
I've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST
They don't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum
You order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience
The service was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level
And the bill was outragous
We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar
The atmosphere is great!!! A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts
Another couple of specials is their bamboo rice, claypot congee noodles
sometimes i get good food and ok service
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service
it is not consistent
really depends on your luck!
I have had some very nice dim sum experience here in the past, but the level of service varies depending on which wait person you get
I have been a fan of their congee for some time now, but the food was only average the last time I went there
It was disappointing because I took my parents with me who were visiting from Japan
I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with crowds or lines
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd
They've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods
If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls (hot)
have to agree with the consensus
when this 1st opened, it was a 'find', but the novelty wore off their food is at best avg
, not good value (congee or 'jook' was very good but not filling, entree dishes pricey)
local tapioca/drink shops popping up better, but then again their prices are hi also
crowded so not worth the wait
SUM IT: If you want to hang out late have a snack then go, but there is better chinese, especially for dim sum type dishes
This place simply takes ordinary food and does a good job of packaging it
The taste and quality of the food is just average
What you really pay for here is the fancy pots, cups and plates, NOT the food
Bottom line, the price is high and the portions are small
Consistently good, authentic Chinese fare
Nothing fancy here - it's quick in and out with minimal decor and service
Gets very crowded
Nice place to handout but pretty expensive
The sweet ~n~ tart cafe was also too crowded
Not much difference from the restaurant
Still theres alot of people eating there
I wouldn't say it's a bad place to eat
Just abit too crowded! Dumplings aren't bad!
i personally don't think sweet-n-tart should be rated as #1
the atmosphere there is nice, but their food isn't that great, very little portion
This place is nothing but a cool high school hangout for late nighters
The food is mediocre and way over priced! A glass of bubble green tea for $4
00!!! The tapiocas weren't even that good
Go across the street to Tapioca Express and get much better drinks for half the price
In fact you can find their menu offerings at other places for better qualities and lower prices
Would not go back there unless it was the only place left still open
Price is reasonable, but there are better choices out there
The food is average
The fruit drinks and teas with tapioca are better
The food is not very special, but very expensive
The Flushing location is even more expensive than its Chinatown location
Also, the Chinatown location is very small and crowded most of the time
Being a taiwanese person, I know what good food is when I eat it
I don't understand why some people don't like this place, but the variety in food is excellent and the food itself is delicious
However, the service isn't that great
I had to wait quite a while to get my food and the waitress almost knocked me in the head with her tray
Other than that, I would recommend this place for the food
The food and drinks are tasteless and expensive
Going there for a meal is a waste of money and time
The title says it all! Highly recommended! A lot of customers, thus line is long
However, it's definitely worth the wait! The noodles are great and shakes are freshly made
Excellent service
A great place for those dinning in two
Most of all, it's CLEAN!
For great, authentic Chinese, this is the place to go
Don't expect elegance, but the food's fantastic
I love this place
This is Hong Kong street food at it's best
Sunday dim sum brunch is great
Service is good
The prices are unbelievably low
4 of us left absolutely stuffed after eating bruch and spent $70, including a to go order!
I've tried nearly everything on the menu and have always been satisfied with what I ordered
My personal favorite is the Seaweed La Mein
recommend it to everyone
The service was slow, the food was ok, but the portions were kinda small, and the place was crowded, had to share a table with other people
To be honest, their dishes are not that special, and don't really taste very good

Despite almost flawless service, I had my birthday there for a party of 15 and we were given a private area on the top floor, which was so cold, we had to keep our jackets on throughout the entire meal
A free round hardly made up for the birthday chill!
The service was bad
The bouncer at the door did not let one of our friends who came late for dinner in because he said the dinner time was over
The food was only mediocre
They charge a lot for the same quality of food you can get at some other restaurants served the same kind of pan-asian food
My boyfriend suprised me with dinner at Tao for our anniversary
What an awesome place! I ordered the Tao-ini and the Miso glazed Chilean Sea Bass
My God, that was good
He got the Seafood Soup thing, and he was amazed at how good it was
Our waiter was very nice and helpful and attentive
I didn't look at the bill, but I know it wasn't cheap, which is Tao's only downfall, but the experience was so worth it
Amazing food, amazing decor
Would definitely go again, but I would need to save up for a while
This is definitely a popular spot with young Manhattan crowd
You must make reservations or you are going to wait for hours at the bar
It is always crowded
The food is ok, the portions are small, and the service is below average
The place itself is gorgeous
It used to be a movie theater, so they have wonderful waterfalls, statues, and very high ceilings
Come in to check it out, but don't eat there
you can do better! Expect to pay $200 per couple
well, Tao is okay
food is good but not remarkable, though drinks I liked! strong! Unfortunately Tao is a rather touristy place
and they're not crazy european tourists but freaking american mid-west
not very high cultured buddies
overall it's okay
if there's nothing else really happening
I am never a fan of establishments that have exclusive guestlists and long waits
But the combination of beauty, style, GREAT *live* music, ambiance, design, service and most importantly
GREAT FOOD
made my 1st experience at Tao a memorable one
Even dealing with what turned out to be an altered reservation and a 1
5hr wait just didn't seem that bad thanks to just how amazing this place is
If you appreciate good Asian cuisine, you owe yourself a sample of Tao
This place is great for lunch
I've been going for over 2 yrs
It's quiet and serene with every table having view of the giant Buddha
The food is very good, definitely give the Kobe Burger a try
The sushi is really good and usually has a nice twist
Everything is surprisingly good and it's refreshing to know there's a good consistent restaurant in midtown for lunch
The restaurant is beautifully designed and is asthetically pleasing
Bar area are fun and drink selection is worthwhile (wines, cold sakes, etc
) However, the food here has really slipped and is now nothing more than average asian fusion at a rather steep price
I would go for drinks and go elsewhere for your fusion food
you will love it! Believe me, I don't like to wait to be seated either, but we just went for dinner last Saturday (group of 10) and enjoyed it AGAIN
Just get a drink at the bar and enjoy while you wait
The food is very good, from appetizers to dessert
I have no complaints!
Went for dinner here last Saturday night against my wishes (read bad reviews, and love Nobu)
Lets jsut say I was pleasantly surprised
First we were seated within a half hour of our reservation
Then our waiter, who looked like Mario Battali and just as jovial and knowledgeable explained to us about the Kobe beef
We tried it and the filet mignon on the stone and the kobe was definately worth the diference in price
We also were talked into cold sake and I have found a new favorite drink
If you are used to the warm this is a much better experience
We didn't have room for desert but there is always a next time
OK, the huge Buddha koi pond might seem cliched to some, but I loved it
I thought it was a peaceful and spare interior, with just the right acoustics -- the room wasn't dead to sound, but wasn't raucous, either
The food was amazing
The service was excellent
We came at noon on a weekday, when the place wasn't too crowded and the music was quiet, so we didn't run into the problems others encountered
It was a completely soothing and pleasing experience
When some friends visiting the city wanted to try Tao, I (unfortunately) agreed
It's right around the corner from my place and at least it's not one of the usual god-awful tourist destinations visiting friends request
There are a few things I can forgive at any popular place: somewhat long waits even with reservations, service staff that mistakenly believes they're there to act haughty rather than serve, and a way over-the-top interior
Tao has all these in spades, to be sure
What I can't forgive is the food
Even the kobe beef was some of the worse I've ever had! The DJ and the chef should swap positions, as neither could do any worse in their counterpart's respective position! The only enternaining part was watching the drooling geeks troll the bar area for skanks
If there's any justice that giant buddah will topple over and crush the chef
I definitely recommend Tao for a special dinner! I went there with six girlfriends and they gave us the royal treatment - a beautiful table on the upper level, looking down over the entire Buddha-blessed place! The drinks were fabulous and my roomate and I STILL talk about our meals! They were delicious
Great atmosphere - one of those places where even the bathroom is worth the trip! Be sure to make reservations though as they don't take walk-ins on the weekends, unless you want to sit in the bar/lounge area (where they do serve the complete dinner menu)
I've heard of horror stories at TAO and the wait
But I must say the overall experience was pretty good
When we first got there with my 8:00pm reservation we were told there was a wait
These people don't know the purpose of a reservation
We didn't get seated till 8:30
Besides that the rest of the night was good
The food we ordered came out promptly and tasted good
Service was good
I am sure that varies with your server
Dessert was good
Will go again but probably on a Tues or Wed
Beautiful place, menu was TOO cryptic
Music was very loud although the live sax/bongo players did add on a bit of sexuality
Overall great place but the food needs help
Beef was great
Docoration was OK
Music was tooooooo loud
I could not hear the waitress nor couldn't like talk
Had to wait for 30 minutes
food was fabulous, menu could have been a little less cryptic
service was sub-standard, music was too loud
but the food was really, really fabulous
Arrived 15 minutes late for the reservation but was seated right away
Waitress was very attentive without being overbearing
Satay Chilean Sea bass for app
Loved the Yellow Fin Tuna
Kobe beef was tasty but definitely over priced
The Big Fortune Cookie is not to be missed

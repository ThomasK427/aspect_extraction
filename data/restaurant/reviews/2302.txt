Harvey the bartender went out of his way to ensure we were well looked after
The Mexican food had some real bite, just the way it should be
A terrific neighbourhood bar that I would highly recommend to anyone
If you are looking for a good venue to watch a hockey game
this is your place
As an Eastern Canadian, where we are famous for our hospitality and bars, the Blue Moon is right up there with ours!! We'll definitely be back
Great Margaritas, tasty eats, and a comfortable yet lively atmosphere that we can take our kid to, or not
Friendly bartenders who know how to keep the tequila flowin'
The Blue Moon is definitely a down-to -earth oasis in a sea of upper east side crap
I was a regular visitor of this fun neighborhood hangout for the many years I lived in NYC
The food is great, the price is right and there is no place better to watch a game
The staff is very welcoming and attentive
I always make a point to stop by whenever I'm in town for a visit
Inside or outside, still a great place to meet for a drink or for some good food and a great friendly attmosphere
Recommended for groups of all sizes with great seats for all
Plenty of TV's and never have to turn your head so see the action
I'll be back
The blue moon has been a staple for upper east siders for years
Comfortable atmosphere, reliable menu and consistant food
Fun place that fits any budget and hey, it's Mexican! Not gourmet, but consistant and good!
Moved to the West Coast 2 years ago from the East Coast
and the food here is bland compared to what I experinced at the Blue Moon Cafe
Carlos and his staff made me feel right at home
my only regret was I found this place my last night in the city
You have a repeat customer and would suggest to all my friend to stop by
Thanks again for the great time
and most importantly stay $$$$$
see u guys soon can't wait to taste the baked wings again
a must try
The patrons were very nice people
The servers were very caring and prompt
We had our 2 sons with us and they were even treated like adults
It is a perfect restraunt
It can me whatever you want it to be - if you want a romantic night then it can be done, family night
done
Please try this place - you won't be sorry
Great neighborhood bar, fun people there, great food and sports
what more could you need?
hand's on owner and his staff make a point of getting to know you if they recognize you, and treat you like faily
make it a regular stop and you won't be disappointed
This restaurant is one to skip
There are tons of better Mexican restaurants in the city
The bar/restaurant is not overly welcoming
The food was average at best and I am being generous
The service is slow and unattentive
The guacamole was below average compared to any other decent Mexican restaurant
Skip it, you can do better at Taco Bell and thats not saying much
A Southwestern Burrito and a Beer, whats better than that to see a game
Best place to watch a Hockey Game, except for Madison Square
The food was horrible and the drinks were so water down
How can you water down shots??? the margaritas were too salty
Plus we had to wait 45 minutes for our food
When I went they had a sign that they needed a chef, what they also need is a new bartender
Over all Service was good, our waitress was very attentive and very nice
If you like meatballs, I recommend going Sunday or Monday! SUpposedly, Mamma makes 'em, and they're great!
They cook the old-fashioned way here
We had a delightful Palm Sunday here
The Sicilian wine was great and my striped bass was outrageous
Everyone enjoyed their dinner
The cheese cake was to die for
I want the recipe
The wait staff was very pleasant and contrary to some reviewers comments, we did not find any attitude problem
We will definitely go again
Everything about our dinning experience was excellent
The wait staff was attentive, without being on top of you, and very knowledgeable about the menu
Whether ordering a staple from the menu, choosing the specials, or with a special request you will not be disappointed
If going for a romantic dinner, I recommend sitting in the expanded dinning room
Food was mediocre, prices were high for what you got
I think the food, particularly the appetizers were excellent
The staff was always friendly and quick to help with recommendations
Obnoxious Rude staff ruin an otherwise acceptable meal
Would highly recommend only to those who thrive on verbal abuse!
While the meal we had at Via Oreto wasn't BAD - it certainly wasn't very good either
I ordered a veal dish that was overly cheesy
(Just WAY too much mozzarella and it was greasy on top of it
)  The service was fine and the price was not too bad - but with so many truly SUPERB Italian restaurants to choose from - we will not return
When you eat sushi, one thing that will make you never go back to a restaurant is one bad piece of fish
Kitaro is very reliable, the fish is always fresh
Try the Tuna or Salmon crunch roll (warning
a little spicy)
Another plus about this place is that it is rarely crowded, with is a good thing for us
My date suggested the place
The sushi was inexpensive and delicious
Service was adequate
Nothing much to say about the place except it's decent and average
The Scene Aureole is suffused with a warm charm, lending a romantic glow to even the most casual of midday meals
Soft light bathes patrons in silver-screen loveliness, while attentive service satisfies their sense of occasion, no matter if they're splurging on the tasting menu paired with wines from the oenophile dream list or simply stopping in for the prix-fixe lunch
The Food Chef Dante Boccuzzi likes food
This should be de facto sentiment for any high-end chef worth his toque, but it's not until halfway through the appetizers--grilled quail, lent toothsome crunch by a cured pancetta wrap, or sashimi-cut fluke lounging on ruby-red grapefruit--that you realize you're savoring every inherent flavor rather than cream or oil
Boccuzzi achieves opulence honestly, balancing lively flavors with clever, complementary preparations
Crispy skate in eggless bearnaise and prosciutto-crusted rabbit luxuriate on the palate, while leaving room for blissful, can't-miss desserts
I took a friend to Aureole for her birthday dinner
I knew of the rave reviews the restaurant has received over the years, but the food and overall experience exceeded our expectations
The staff treated us like we were regulars--they were extremely friendly and always attentive
We had the tasting menu which was spectacular! The presentation of each course was like a work of art and the food tasted amazing!!!!! If you ever need a place to go for a special occasion, this is it!
I had read all the reviews on this site before I went so I was on the lookout for any of the negatives noted in the preceding reviews
Personally we didn't experience any of them
We were greeted in a friendly but not obsequious manner by every single staff member
We had a nice glass of wine and each got the tasting menu for $35
We were served three lovely plates in succession, each one better than the next

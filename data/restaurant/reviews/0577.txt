I would never go back
I love this restaurant's food so much that I keep going back, but I have to beg the management - please, please stop overbooking! A wait of an hour plus for a reserved table with no apology and serious attitude from the wannabee actress hostesses is simply not acceptable
The prosciutto plates are delicious, the pastas unbeatable and the hangar steak melts in your mouth
All of the waiters that I have had are pros
So why have such amateurs running the hostess station? NB - they have a great alcove and a back room that's fantastic for groups
We had 3 very different pasta dishes but unfortunately, all of them were way too salty
Rich but salty
Almost felt that the salt was hiding the possibility of tainted food since we had the blackout the week earlier
Put it this way, the food didn't digest very well
i love this new spot--but i have only one complaint: when i ordered the prosciutto special with peaches, there was not enough prosciutto--i know this b/c i had it with melon last time and the serving was generous
anyway, the octopus was incredible, well cooked with the potatoes and large caper garnish
perfect
i had the salmon with corn and BACON (i can call it pancetta if you insist) and it was fabulous
the lambchops with goat cheese polenta were also really great
i orderd a glass of pinot noir from an oregon vineyard--gorgeous
teh desserts are off the hook, especially the profiteroles with pistachio ice cream
this is a mellower il bucco without the bells and whistles and to be honest, i much preferred it
the food's great
I had no expectations - just passing by and decided to eat here
The food was unbelievably amazing - from appetizer to main course to dessert
The waiter was polite and attentive
I was most impressed with how fantastic the food was in correlation with the modest price-range - a total bargain in my book
went for the second time on monday night
all the prosciutto plates are delicious
the spaghetti carbonara was absolutely sublime! you can even order it as an appetizer and then order an entree
prices are very reasonable
wine list is average
the only con was the wait staff
our waiter said and did all the things he was supposed to but his attitude ruined his service rating
he just didn't seem to care or maybe he was bored
overall, i enjoyed both times i went
i would definitely go back
Been to Crispo twice and both times the food has been very good
The wait to be seated (got seated close to 10pm for an 8:30pm reservation for 2) the first time I went was a bit excessive but the food turned out to be worth the wait
Enjoy!
We went for a late dinner on a Monday night - the atmosphere was smooth and warm and the service was friendly and accurate without being intrusive
Then the food arrived - sensational! I would not hesitate to recommend Crispo and there's no doubt we're going back
What more can I say? My fiancee and I had 2 of the specials and they were sooooooo tasty, both of us finished them in about 10 minutes! We had a wonderful bottle of wine that complimented the meal very well and I had the Creme Brulee for dessert
I thought that the total bill was very reasonable for all that we had and the ambiance was just great
It gets full pretty quickly, even during the week, so I suggest making dinner reservations early
Trendy 14th street restaurant
Attractive space but you always feel like you're in a basement
The staff is friendly and effficient
The food is moderately priced
The food is creative and sometimes marvelous, sometimes what-were-they-thinking? I've gone back many times
I saw Crispo as a candidate for best new restaurant in Time Out New York so I thought I would give it a try
The crowd was far from trendy and the food was okay, nothing special
The music was terrible
Crispo is a nice restaurant to go to with your college buddies if you live in the area, but nowhere near the best new restaurant in New York
Loved the place when I walked in! It had a great ambient atmosphere and I loved the lighting and rich wood and brick
The bartender took about 10 minutes to notice us at the bar although it wasn't that crowded
The long-awaited drinks were delicious (I had a red apple martini) and we were seated timely and with a smile from the sweet hostess (no attitude mercifully)
The waiter was a doll, the Pancetta appetizer delightful (although we had to ask for bread that was supposed to come when we sat down)
My tortino with garbanzo beans with surprisingly greasy and limp
Not happy with that, but my friend's mushroom/pasta dish was really great
The house merlot was a happy surprise
Our chocolate dessert was yummy but not excellent
Overall I would revisit Crispo, but probably make smarter menu choices
I had high expectations for Crispo and was disappointed with the restaurant
I arrived without a reservation and was told that there was a wait but that it shouldn't take too long
However, it was a very long wait (over 45 min) and I confronted the hostess who stated that she could not find me at the bar and she had seated 6 other parties before me
Our waiter was excellent as was our food
However, we were never served bread with our meals and the restaurant is too crowded
I would not recommend this restaurant to others
We had a warm knowledgeable waitress, the bus service was a little underpar (the bread didn't arrive until the apetizer) but the drinks were very reasonable (6-8 for a very decent red wine by the glass and only 8! for a vodka martini) and the food was very very good and under 18 for each entree
We were seated promptly and never rushed
Crispo is the epitome of a trendy, crowded, new restaurant that will not last more than six months!
There were about 4 tables filled in the entire restaurant yet the hostess made us sit at the bar for 20 mins--she never would have come for us had we not approached her asked to be seated
The food and waitstaff were excellent and therefore I would definitly recommend
Good food
Bad attitude
The reservations people were rude; the people at the door were rude; the wait staff was indifferent
Crispo thinks it's hotter stuff than it is
Incredible Service and pasta that redeemed the awful start
we waited almost 40 minutes before getting sat in the crowded smoky bar area
we expected the worst but we were greeted by an enthusiastic waiter who promised us the best pasta you'll ever have
we took his suggestions and were extremely pleased
we started with a hot proscuitto dish that was simply fabulous, next we had a rigatoni, which delivered on our servers promise
our main course was the sea bass with artichokes and steak
the crowded bar soon disappeared and we enjoyed one of the best dining experiences in months
i will reccommend this place to all my peers with one caution, go during the week
Thank you Crispo for coming to our neighborhood!!!!!!
I loved Crispo! It had a really nice relaxing atmosphere
The food was excellent! I will definitly recommend it to my friends!
Thoughts: unmemorable food, pushy service, disappointed - overall, I had a bad taste in my mouth when I left about the restaurant and the entire experience
I went with a girlfriend to get a bottle of wine and a few appetizers - both of us were disappointed in their menu and in the wine that was recommended to us
The waitress seemed particularly displeased that we had ordered a bottle of wine at the bar (even though we had a wait)
If you don't mind near-claustrophobic crowds, Crispo is a surefire bet for good, hearty, sophisticated downtown dining without a designer price tag
No wonder you're packed in like sardines: the food is consistently fresh and appealing, and a 3 course dinner for two (with cocktails or wine) will still clock in at less than $75
Servers are overworked but extremely friendly and upbeat
Have been back 3 times, and will continue to do so!
Went there for dinner with 3 of my friends on a Monday night
It was quite busy - a little loud, and seating is close together- but overall I can't say enough
The food was fantastic, the service great, and a wonderful, reasonably priced wine list
Will be back, and will recommend
crowded, food above average,but not worth a return trip
The service was good
the menu here is extremely lacking, very little to choose from
This would deserve about a 20 food rating in zagat
veal tortellini pretty good, everything else average, hangar steak not good

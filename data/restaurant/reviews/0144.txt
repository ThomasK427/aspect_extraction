The waiters are clueless, they know it, and they don't care
People are still going to pack the place
The guys who bus the tables are great there, better than the waiters
I hope they're tipping them out well
Bar service is pretty good too
Lasagna is awesome, I think
If you can get past the crappy wait staff, Max is definitely good for some inexpensive, very good Italian food
Great sangria too!
The lasagna is incredible--the best I've had outside of Italy
Actually anything with red sauce is incredible there, and almost all pastas are $9
95
The decided downfall is the authentically Continental service
I go to Max on a weekly basis, and always have to leave the table and walk over to our waitor to request more water, the check, etc
But if great, cheap Sicilian cuisine is what you're looking for, you won't find a better restaurant than Max!
Weird about the other review
I got the lasanga and it was great
Very very hot
The appetizer of the balsamic vinegear with the shredded lettuce isn't work it and didn't have much taste to it
You get some big portions here
The sangria isn't worth the 26 buck a pitcher either now that I think about it
The service is bad here
The waiter came by once, to take our order and it took forever to get the dinner check from him
We could have probably just left and they wouldn't have known
I am reading all the reviews, in here about MAX, and i ask my self who is writing these reviews, the owners may be, cause they all look the same, i cant belive this
I was in max last week and it was the last time for me
The service is the worst service you can get in the city, the waiters think they are doing a favor to you, and if you have a problem with your food or servivce as i did (cold lasagna), the manager, will come to you, and with just an avarage english, she will not give you any answer to your questions, and you will get free tiramisu
It happends to me 2 times, and i dont even eat dessert
Then the pasta is not home made, except for the gnochi
This is not an italian concept!!!
I went there last night with my boyfriend, and Max is one of those places that reminds me of why I love my neighborhood so much
It's cute, it's unpretentious and so very comforting and yummy
The place is very welcoming, the wait staff is nice and talk about great Italian comfort food!  I am happy to know around the block I can sit, sip wine under dim lit candle lights, eat good pasta and feel at home at this wonderful little spot
I wil be going back a lot!
We go to Max's often, and the food is consistently deilicious! There is usually a wait, and the bar is small and crowded
But after you sit down, you realize it was well worth the wait! Don't forget to bring cash
Although it's cash only, and deceptively small-looking from the outside, this long and well-tabled interior is comfortable with a sizable backyard behind the bar (back of the restaurant)
Their wine selection is impressive for such a small place and their homemade sangria is very good
The food is above average basic Italian fare that is prepared as it should be, making me long for my grandmother's sunday dinners
It's three areas of seating provide spaces for groups, kids, couples, friends
Don't judge it from the outside, you'll be surprised how much space (although a bit narrow) it has to offer
The waitstaff is very nice and patient and will help you select a dish if you're unsure
Their daily specials are good as well as the desserts
Years ago, I had gone to the Max in bklyn and remember the food being out of this world
I went there last Sat and although the atmosphere was so great (sit in the garden), I was a tad disspointed with the food
My mixed salad was fine but had very little taste and my pasta with basil, sauce and eggplant was equally ok
The bread and dipping sauce were amazing and the sangria was really good
I will def come back though because it has such character - maybe I just ordered the wrong thing
must try thier mushroom ravioli !!! i find myself going back there to have the bread with the tomatoe sauce and olives, i can eat the entire basket myself ! they have an extensive southern itailan wine menu
i love thier pastas, so VERY FRESH ! worth the wait
Great, in-expensive food
Outside seating
Friendly (and cute) waiters
Need I say more!
Max is nondescript from the outside, but cozy once inside
The restaurant is small and doesn't take reservations, which means that it can be a wait for larger groups
Standing at the bar trying to keep your glass of wine from being jostled by passing waiters, you inhale the scents of the food and your stomach growls
You can only hope it's worth the wait -- and it is! I recommend the gnocchi, it's the best I've ever had
And the prices are so afforable you won't have to think twice about ordering extra sides
i love this place
the only cons are the wait and the wine menu
i think for the price of the food the wine is a little pricey but the lasagne is to die for! it's perfect
i am pretty sure the secret is the addition of bechamel sauce
it's the only place i prefer the lasagne to my sicilian mother's homemade lasagne
you often have to sit at a table with someone you didn't come with and there's no where to comfortably wait if you have to sometimes an excess of 45 minutes
it's worth it though
in the end
Great Italian food at reasonable prices
Can't go wrong on the lasagna
Great appetizers and sangria, too
While the quality of food is always the same --good rustic Italian food for affordable prices, but there are two big problems
The first is the music is ridiculously loud and suitable for a nightclub or the such, and even worse, the service can be very poor
The waiters spend a lot of time drinking their own glass of wine and not asking you if you want anything more
Seems to me that the cooks and busboys are the real waiters and workers in this joint
Just came back from Max for the second time this week
Large portions, clean, good service, and reasonable priced food
Flavor in everything prepared
The individuals that I dined with loved the food as well
Just came back from a late dinner on a Monday night
Everything was excellent
The black ink pasta with shrimp is amazing
The spices are just right
The service was amazing as well
as always
Gotta love this place
First time I was here was in the summer of 2001
It had a charm and sitting in the patio with the laundry made you feel like you were in that seen from 101 dalmations
Since then I have frequented Max but the charm has started to fade
I don't know if it's pricier than it used to be, or the lack of variety in the menu, or the consistently ooh so service
Guess the Tramp in me needs to be pampered
a 40 minute wait at 9pm on a wednesday? cheesy novelty trance music drowning out your conversation? hostesses who could teach the boogeyman a thing or two about intimidation?  max, you used to be full of east village grace
i still kinda like you
your food is yum
your patio is pretty
but please stop catering to the upper west siders who get their kicks slumming it below 14th street
thank you
As with any trendy hipster restaurant, you need to pick the right night to go
The food is always excellent and service depends on how crowded it is that night
I've been a regular for three years now and have never been disappointed in the food
Wow, its great to know Im not the only one upset with Maxs service! It sucks because I really liked the pasta
Its basic Italian cuisine, but tasty and affordable

The food lacked any unique flavor
It tasted like they didn't prep the meat at all

The sides were, for lack of a better word, nasty
5
The lighting was too bright
In review: Don't waste your time or money
It was the first time I left the restaurant angry
If decor, service, atmosphere, excitement, youth, multi-sensory experience, trendiness are important to you
skip this place
If quality of food (not quality dining experience) is your priority you will not be dissapointed
Both the veal and steak dishes where fantastic
I do agree with an earlier citysearch reviewer who alluded to a really poor attitude towards younger diners
Also, we felt very cramped at our table
Despite these drawbacks, I would dine here again, as its one of the best steakhouses in nyc
This classic NY Steakhouse lives up to its reputation
Great steaks, sides(creamed spinach, potatoes, etc
) and delicious desserts
The wine list was very good and the bar area was a cool place to hang before we sat down for our great meal
Highly recommended
We were treated like children
We are in our mid-twentys and the waiters gave us no attention to us after we received our meals
We sat at our table over 25 minutes even had a wine spill and still noboby came
There was a group of older gentleman sitting beside us and the waiter came to their table several times while passing by our wine spilled table
Overall our first and needless to say last experience was unacceptable and unenjoyable
Ate here last weekend before a show
We were seated promptly by Ben himself
Had a 5 p
m
reservation and the place wasn't crowded
Gave us time to walk off dinner before the show which I highly recommend
My filet was the largest I've had; not the best, but still a very good steak
The green beans and mashed potatoes were outstanding
Creme brulee with fruit was to die for - devasted I didn't have room to finish it
I liked the decor a lot - very comfortable
Pictures make it appear brighter than it actually is
The steaks are good and the desserts are big but leave something to be desired
The cheescake is dry, pound cake bland, and bread pudding chewy
The wood is old and needs to be re-worked and the lights need to be dimmed
Service is good though
Ben Benson's serves one of the best tasting steaks in town
Not to mention, their crab cakes truly are as good as everyone leads you to believe
They also have the best wine selection of any steak house I've been to on the east coast
Although a bit pricey and host to NY's elite, the food here is an experience for anyone
Must make an attempt to eat here at least once in your lifetime
I found this restaurant to be very disappointing, the waiter was very snobbish and rude
he made no attempt to be polite
I did not feel welcome or comfortable at all
The steak was tough and inedible
We dont usually frequent very expensive restaurants so this was supposed to be a treat for us
I will never go to this pompous overrated place again!
took my girlfriend here for dinner on new years eve, and the experience was outstanding
we were seated promptly, and the service was teriffic
hands down the best skirt steak i have ever eaten, and the mashed potatoes w/horseradish are also superb
if you are looking for a great place for a special occasion this is a good choice
When my family took a trip to NY this summer, my dad took us there after we saw a show on broadway
It was raining, and we got there a little early, and they went ahead and seated us
The service was great
My dad goes there when he takes people out to dinner in NY for work
He said they have always had great service
The food was flat out amazing
I had the filet mignon, and it was the best thing i have ever eaten
I would definitly go to Ben Bensons!
After reading positive reviews in both Citysearch and Zagats, I decided to try Ben Bensens yesterday
To say that we were dissapointed is an understatement
To begin with, we were seated in the hallway
The food was mediocre at best
The mozzerella and tomato was very bland
I had the t-bone which was plain, dry, and flavorless
I could have gotten a piece of meat at Waldbaums, broiled it, and it would have tasted better
My wife had the prime rib
Again, it was flavorless, and very tough
She was having a hard time cutting it
The hash browns were very good
Service was horrible
It took about 1/2 hour to clear off the table after we finished dinner
Even the cappucino did not have much taste
Keep in mind that this is a very expensive restaurant that was not worth 1/2 the price
Next time, I'll stick with Mortons
My wife Jenny and I, always have a good time at Ben Bensons Steak house
This time was even more special when our waiter, Mario # 2 and the entire staff sang Happy Birthday to my wife
It was a pleasant surprise and one that my wife and I will never forget
The wait staff worked as a team to ensure that our requests were satisfied
So make that reservation, and ask for Mario # 2, I am sure you will have an exceptional time
The wait staff was very stiff, no personality was so ever!!! The food had NO seasoning
Portions were excellent, however, the food was bland
Would never go back
Wow, what a place!!! Its amazing how Ben Bensons makes us happy with great steak, wine and friendly service
Feel great every time I visit
Thank you
yes, i know it's a steakhouse, but we wanted a Maine lobster
It was very dissappointing, dry, over-cooked and tasteless
Howver, the Crabcake was awesome! Creamed spinach was tasty, but the hashbrowns were a greasy mess
Service great
Will go back for a steak, because they looked wonderful
What a treat, again
Great Steaks!!! Great service!!! Who cares about decor
Surfing the web, I came across the NYC Visit website
I saw the ad for restaurant week, and was intrigued
I noticed that Ben Bensons was listed as one of the participants

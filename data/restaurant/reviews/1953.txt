It's impossible to park during the day, easier at night and weekends
Food is excellent here
Real authentic indian food
Very nice ambience and service
I went to Pekin Duck House alone, looking to experiment the great pleasure of a good pekin duck
The problem was that the menu does not include a one-person pekin duck dish
The minimum is two persons
As the waiter told me the two-person pekin duck would be too much for me, I asked him for alternatives
He suggested me to order two plates (crispy duck and some kind of pork), which he said would be just good enough for one person
The bottom-line is that they brought a full-blown chinese banquet (which had a lot more food than the actual two-person pekin duck dish) which I ate without regret as the food was great
I would have had the pekin duck without any trouble but the waiter failed to explain this
I guess it was a communication problem as all the guys were chinese
The customer service and attention was good
The guys were not unpolite but neither friendly
Dont expect to get the free smiles
Price/Value was very good
The place was clean and nice
If you are in China Town this is the place to have a nice chinese cuisine meal whether its a pekin duck or any other dish
I could not find any other acceptable restaurant
I am originally from beijing so I know what a good roasted peking duck tastes like
this is definately not it
the duck is not freshly roasted, it has been sitting under the IR lamp for hours, skin is not crispy
the most funny thing is the pancake, they use tortillla for the wrap of the duck!!! I do not know how can this business servive in new york china town
We were a group of 5 Chinese people
Outside of the waiters, we were the only Asians there
Never a good sign at a Chinese restaurant
The decor is actually pretty nice for Chinatown, but the food and service was lacking
First of all, the Peking Duck was alright, but instead of the fluffy white flour buns, you get a huge tortilla with a weird smell
Most good Peking Duck places will also prepare and serve the first sandwich
For some reason, they just plopped down the duck and condiments and walked away
Unfortunately, we also ordered entrees
Grand Marnier Prawns = Not good
Some crispy beef dish that had crispy but no discernible beef = Not good
Even the fortune cookies had weird fortunes
All in all, a terrible meal
I had to apologize to my group and take them to ice cream at the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory
We called for reservations, but were told that they were limited to people who want a $24 prix fixe menu with only one duck per table
No thanks
So we got there at 5:45 and told the harried maitre d' we don't know how many will show up
We waited for 5 people and then got a table
We ended up being 9
Though obviously not happy with our expansion, the waiters remained polite and accommodated everyone
As usual, the duck was EXCELLENT, reasonable ($36 per duck) and easily fed 3
It could be stretched to 4
The appetizers were nothing special, but you don't come here for the appetizers
Great meal and the waiters put up with our troublesome crew, with no complaining
--Eat Club is a roving group of NY gluttons
Food is average, just nice ambience because it's newly renovated, rude customer service
The decor is modern and definitely more hip than anything else in the neighborhood, plus it's a bit more clean
However, it's a very cramped space, especially on a busy Saturday night when you're dining elbow to elbow
It's also very loud, especially upstairs, such that you may not be able to hear what your dinner companion is saying
Make reservations or stand on line
I had the dumplings and the peking duck, both of which were good, although the duck was a bit greasier than I'm used to
My date and I shared the appetizer and the duck, plus he had a beer, and the total bill was a little less than $50, so it wasn't a bank-breaking meal
I've never had Peking Duck so didn't hesitate when a colleague invited me out for a Chinese New Year lunch celebration
The menu was a bit pricey but with four people, the Peking Duck special is not a bad deal at all
Everything we had was very very tasty
I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Chinese food in NYC, especially among the thousands of other restaurants in Chinatown
The space is a bit cramped but the decor is impressive compared to the other simple restaurants in the neighborhood
The service can make any patient person frustrated
but I would still recommend it
You gotta try it once
Very very yummy!
This restaurant was like entering another world
The place was full of feng shui in a modern sheik way
It was a complete change from outside in Chinatown
The food was simply amazing
Yes we had to wait but what place in NYC do you not have to wait? The people are all extremely polite and helpful
The duck was carved in front of us and was so amazing I wasn't sure if I should eat faster so I get a larger helping then my friends or if I should eat slow and savor the food
I will be back again and again becasue it was truely a heavenly experience and would recommend it to anyone!! :)
The hostess is in dire need of a lesson in manners
The first mistake was when she lied about the amount of time my family would have to wait to eat their overpriced food (45 minutes)
Then after about an hour and a half of waiting she said (directly quoted), Well, these people have been waiting also and they made reservations so I only feel badly for them
Finally, she blatantly told my party to just try next door
Excuse me miss, but please deflate that gigantic head of yours
I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone
I have been to the Peking Duck House many times over the past few years and I always leave happy
The duck is well-prepared, juicy and perfectly sliced
The accompanying vegetables have been fresh 95% of the time, and the pancakes are always excellent
The Chinese food is also decent standard fare, but go for the duck
They are busy, but I have never needed reservations for groups smaller than 6 people, regardless of which day or time of day
The wait staff is attentive, yet unintrusive and the restaurant is clean and elegantly minimalist
I have brought larger groups (10 people) to the restaurant and the wait staff is very accommodating
There is also a room on the lower level for large groups, but you should make a reservation
Really, I have no cons
Walked in one evening with a friend, and was promptly turned away since we didn't have a reservation
Called a few weeks later to make a reservation, and called a second time to move the reservation back one hour only to have the receptionist bark just show up, before he slammed the phone in my ear
This is the best Peking duck place in NY
All 5 times I have been there, I haven't been disappointed
The duck meat is moist and the skin is crispy
The other dishes on the menu is above average, but I would never go to this place only for the entrees
Service is good when the servers are in a good mood, which is typical of a lot of traditional asain restaurants
For the times I went, the service was above average for a chinese restaurant, but not spetacular
The place is small and gets a bit crowded and loud
It's clean and appropriate for non-intimate dates and casual business dinners
We've eaten at this top-notch Chinatown restaurant many times and the namesake 'peking duck' is really terrific
The other entrees and appetizers are as good as most other local places, but don't miss the duck which is usually prepared tableside
Try to eat upstairs - downstairs is somewhat tight
Service was absolutely fine - no complaints!
I have been a regular of this restaurant for years

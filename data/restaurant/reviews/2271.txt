Each waiter took a turn belting out a tune and they were all quite good
However, food was average though service was fine
(I did like my 'Thanksgiving' meal of turkey and dressing, but the family said their meals were fair
) Bottom line, good place for families vs
normal Manhattan restaurants if you overlook the noise
Went here for an early dinner around 5pm
There is some overhead construction outside so there are scaffolds blocking the diner, so it was a little harder to spot
Singing waiters were good, though a little too loud
Dinner was good, service was good
Prices were better than I expected
We would go back
The singing wait staff are great, the food is just awful!! Not even up to diner greasy spoon par
Have a snack and enjoy the singing
If yo do decide to have a whole meal be prepared to pay as though your in a 5 star restaurant!
We wanted an entertaining place to eat and we sure got it
Singing, friendly service, no waiting, we even had a birthday person and they announced it, sang, gave ice cream sunday with a candle, food was good, reasonable prices
Thanks for the good time
I had a quick dinner here before going to the theatre
the happy, energetic atmosphere got you in a light mood and was very enjoyable
The wait staff were all professional and extremely talented
I expect to see them on Broadway next time I'm in the city!! I only had a grilled chicken salad so can't judge the food too extensively but I'd recommend Ellen's just for the fun factor alone!
This was my favorite restaurant ever
The atmosphere was great and the servers were wonderful, very friendly and courteous
Looking forward to going back soon
The waiters are more concerned about singing, than they are about serving
And the place is too small and noisy
I had waiters literally singing over my head, that is very annoying when you are trying to have a conversation
The food was horrible!!!! I ordered a cheese and bacon omelet and the bacon was raw, white!!! I sent it back and they came back with another omelet with Canadian bacon which I don't like and when I cut into the egg, it was runny with egg white and yolk because it was not cooked on the inside
HOW DISGUSTING!! What restaurant can't get the omelets right!!!! I thought maybe the cook was in the back singing too!!!! If you want to go somewhere crowded and noisy with lousy over priced food (two omelets and shakes was $31 and they were not edible) than this is the place for you
The cast
ummm wait staff are funny, friendly, and just terrific! My daughter giggled through lunch
The prices are okay, but the food was very good, as was the service
I'll be back for sure!!
I had a really great time at Ellen's Stardust Diner
The food was really good, and the singing waitstaff was very entertaining
If you want to go to a place that provides a genuine good time, come here
And if you are into 50's nostalgia, this is the place to go!
We had the best time on our visit
When we arrived there was a line out the door, we had a table within 10 minutes for our group of 5
We were there on a busy Saturday afternoon the second week in December
It was a little loud, but loud doesnt mean bad, everyone there was having a good time
The entertainment was great, and the food was too
If you are a person who wants perfect service, you should probably skip it, you may wait for your server to sing a song before you get your drinks but that is half the fun
It definately has been added to my to do list for all my visits to the city
Worst place I have ever been to
These people care about is singing
Maybe if they spent less time singing and collecting money for their 'singing tips' for voice lessons, maybe then the sevice would not be bad
Took 20 min to get a cup of coffee, the staff ignored the customers
Their response they were waiting for clean cups!!! Ordered the chocolate chip pancakes which was suppose to come with whip cream
Came plain until asked, then it took another 5min to get the sryup, and then 10 min to get the butter
You think they went to milk the cow and churn the butter themselves
My friends ordered the salmon plate with bagels and it didn't come with cream cheese though on the menu it said it did, and when asked, we were told there was no cream cheese!! That somehow appeared 15 min later
NEVER EVER AGAIN
This is a place to go to when you need something loud and wacky in your life
Don't go here when you're desparately hungry or on a time schedule
The entertainers are actually you waiters(resses) so service can be spotty
The food is basic roadside diner fare with some additions mostly done competently with a couple of standouts and some duds
Entertainment is definitely better than William Hung but maybe not quite Idol finalist
If you go in with the right attitude you'll have a great time
This is New York, think of yourself as an innocent bystander
Allegria is a delightful match of food quality, service and value
From out of town, I have eaten there several times over the past year, with only one other person or up to 12, at dinner and at lunch times  We have always been happy with the food (Sea Bass Allegria I especially recommend), and the service is very efficient
The prices are most reasonable, considering the quality
After I confirmed the hours of the restaurant earlier in the day, I arrived at the Allegria 35 minutes before closing time
The first thing the waiter said was, You have to eat fast
This was probably not a good sign, but the Allegria was directly on my walk down Sixth Avenue back to my hotel, so I sat down
I ordered the ravioli special of the day
The dish arrived lukewarm, and frankly, three days later, I cannot recall what was in the ravioli, which were covered in a bland tomato sauce
I guess I must not have consumed it quickly enough, for servers twice tried to take the plate before I finished
I returned to my hotel, wished that my room had a microwave oven
I am not a big consumer of frozen foods, but I'd take Lean Cuisine over this restaurant any day
Nothing special about this place
I think the food is okay
The waitress we had was somewhat pretentious and uninterested in answering any of our questions we had about their dishes
Their drinks are just blah
I probably wouldn't go back
We found this place by accident and have since returned twice on purpose
We found the food very good, the service extremely attentive, the decor pleasant if unexciting, the location convenient
It compares favorably to other restaurants in the same price range and we'll no doubt return
I cannot believe the negativity in the reviews
we loved this restaurant we stumbled upon
We only waited about 15 minutes w/o a reservation
Our waiter was so sweet and helpful
The food was excellent
It was a little small inside, but I would dine here again! Excellent shrimp appetizer!
I love italian cusine, and I was very surprised by the quality and authenticity of the food
The fried calamari and the beef short ribs was the die for it
The waiter gave us a great wine sugestion
Beatiful wine list
I would like to go back and say I was wrong
well not this time
Go there for dinner this time and find it unusually bad in taste and not pleasent service at all
I had lunch there quiet a while ago and remember how pour the service and the food were
Sorry but certain expensive places should NOT fead Manatthan diners
Great italian food!! Friendely and eficient service
Great place to have a romantic dinner or business lunch
I am italian, and after many year working in New York City, I found an authentic italian cusine
Great special in a resonable prices
well developed wine list and fresh ingredients make this little restaurant a jewel of italian food
The food is great here - very traditional and reasonably good value

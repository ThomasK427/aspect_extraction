I was not disappointed at all
The food was well prepared and good decorated!!
I had Green Curry which was served in a coconut!!! Wow, awesome
The service was excellent and everything there was just Great
Prem on made my first time trying Thai food in such a memorable experience ever
I love this place!
I have never gotten up and left a restaurant until I went to Prem
We had a reservation and we didn't get seated until an hour later- because we kept asking
Once seated, there was no waitress to give us our menus
When we got the host, he took our order
After another half an hour of still no waitress, we inquired again
When she finally showed up, it was to tell us they were out of our appetizer
We were seated almost an hour at this point
We got up and left
It absolutely sucked
They get a big fat 0 for service!!
We went to Prem-on last night and WALKED OUT
We were promised a 15 minute wait for a two person table that ended up being over an hour
If that is not enough, we waited 1 HOUR for 2 appetizers
Our waitress' only response was to completely ignore us and avoid eye contact
When 1 of the two appetizers finally arrived--it was ice cold
At this point, we did something we have not done in years of dining in Manhattan--we walked out the restaurant and went down the street to the Burger Joint
Absolutely unbelievable!!! Dont waste your time here
i love everything about this place
reasonably priced, great ambience/decor, and top-notch service
drinks were good (as someone mentioned before the islandtini is great and looks pretty to boot), food well-presented and very tasty (the duck, sea bass, and salmon-- all yummy! dumpling appetizer good too)
highly recommend the special green rice
i don't love creme brulee but theirs was (obviously) asian-style, light and not too sweet
i had a lovely time and will definitely be coming back!
I ate here this past friday
The place is dimly lit, warm and inviting, and stylish
I had a drink called an Islandtini (check website) ITS WAY TO DANGEROUSLY GOOD!!! Oh my god, the best specialty cocktail I've ever had
We had their Tom Yum Goong to start, it was nice and spicy served in this stone bowl (easy to share)
I had the penang curry, it comes served in a mini pumpkin, DELICIOUS
My girl had the Salmon, it was very fresh tasting and bursting with flavor
Washed it all down with a bottle of reistling
Throughout the evening service was excellent
My nice waitress even came running out of the restaurant to hand me a tiny box I had forgotten on the table
From the moment we entered, the service was outstanding
Jay greeted us at the bar, promptly served our drinks and volunteered to discuss the menu with us
He later met us at our table to see if we had any other questions before we ordered
Everything he suggested was outstanding
We loved the crispy Sea Bass and a delicious chicken dish served in a coconut
Every appetizer and entree was bursting with unique flavor that arouses your senses
The ambience is intimate and interesting - even the restroom has a special style! The staff at Pre-Mon are truly concerned about the customer and care to make your entire dining experience top notch
Prem-on is one of the best eating experiences in all of manhattan
The food is fresh, delicious, creative, and memorable
The crispy sea bass is one of the best dishes on the menu
The lobster salad is also excellent
The service is top notch and the restaurant is trendy, but casual
Great atmosphere, excellent service, and spectacular food
Many of the dishes are better than comparable dishes at nobu or kittichai
You can't go wrong
Try this restaurant!!!
They have an extensive tapas menu at $4-$6
I love chive cake and dumpling
For people need bigger portion, I will recommend them order an entrees
Entrees are average
The indoor seating is very small and you will walk out with smell of food
They have nice outdoor seating tent but in winter it is cold
It is a nice place to go when the weather is not extreme
I've been there many times
The waitstaff are very friendly and food come quick
The food is really tasty, and at $5 to $6 a plate for tapas, it's a better deal (and less of that highway robbery feeling at the end) than the trendy Southeast Asian Kuma Inn nearby
However, don't go expecting 'cheap eats'
The portions at Jeeb are small -- even the bottles of Coca Cola are tiny to match
If you're really hungry, like I was, you'll end up ordering several servings to fill your appetite, which add up to a large bill all the same
It is true that the hostess is not entirely sweet (it's like speaking with someone who'd politely rather not be in your company), but once you don't have to deal with *her* anymore, the friendliness of the servers inside make up for it
I recommend the fried chicken wings and roast duck entree
I order take out and go there often
Sat-Sun from 8-10 pm is not a good time to order a take out, once or twice was slow
Dine-in, the salad and tapas is great
I am not a big curry fan, however seafood and sauteed were well-prepared (the duck had too much fat on it)
I like the friendly servers rarely wear typical dark clothing
It is fun to see them have fun out of what they do
The helpful wine list telling me what to pair my food with
I don't mind the reasonable charge
I had to pay the cork-fee for $40 before, this one is only $12
The heat doesn't work well by the patio
Suggestion: dim the light, keep up good work, keep this price, music was barely heard last time
sometimes too quiet or too loud
I like the opening roof like in the past summer
This place was great in the summer when it was still BYOB and 80 degrees
However, when the temperature is sub-zero and you are still seated outside the dining experience becomes sub-par
The outdoor dining area where the majority of seating is located has the illusion of being heated, what with the plastic siding and heater-like contraption in the corner
But don't be fooled
No heat is actually generated in the patio area and you will have to eat your whole meal with your coats on
And, on top of the frigid temperatures, the service is slow and confused
Finally, the BYOB policy is no longer in effect so there is a $2 charge for each beer and $12 for wine
It's too bad, too, because the food is pretty good
Jeeb is one of my favorite places in NYC
basically, I'm a huge fan of Thai food
so I've been trying to try as many places as I could
I went to this place very randomly
I've been trying a padthai, black noodle, penang curry,chickenwith vegetable and ducksalad
what I had are so far sooo good! no MSG is the most attractive thing here
but for service matter, I can't say it's a good place, the service is unorganized but I believe it's worth it!
Friday around 8pm I ordered delivery
After an hour of waiting I called, they said that my order is on its way
I live near by, so when they didnt show after 20 minutes I called again

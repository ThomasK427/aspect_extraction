The music is good in variety, which varies from international to hip hop/trance
Some may experience some attitude at the door which is never a pleasant experience
Worth trying if you know someone who promotes the place (hint) or if you're willing to shell out the $$$ for the sangria and lambchops with couscous
Place was great
Went there on friday for my sisters Bachelorett party and had a blast
The vibe there was very energetic and a ton of fun
The doormen quickly took care of us since And we didnt have to wait online
The Garden area has a little ibiza feel to it
Would highly recommend it
Beautiful place, great music, amazing potential but the staff is rude, the place is overcrowded and the drinks are expensive
which would be fine if they actually put alcohol in them
This is by far, one of my few favorite spots I am one very picky person
Well bottle service is worth the price, imo
I thought the door men were fair to us
Who cares about the door men anyway
it's what's inside that matters
Me and my girls had a blast there last wknd, it was like 10 of us hot chicas
Great mixed music, awesome energy
Loved smoking the hookas while sipping martinis
Oh yeah, some hot middle eastern papis
;) I highly recommend
These guys think that they own the world and they forgot that we are going there TO HAVE A GOOD TIME! On Sunday I made the mistake to celebrate my birthday there
We went there around 8pm so that we can get in without any trouble
When we went out to smoke a cigarette around 10, the door guyz who were so welcoming in the beginning have already turned into EGOmaniacs and didnt let my friends back in because they were too loud
I didnt know we should have behaved as if we were in a library, that is a club man and you drink there and com'on be a little flexible instead of acting like a school teacher! We had bought 4 of the pitchers of sangria that costed around $50/each and I think that was a waste
Terrible birthday experience
Thank you Le Souk for ruining my birthday!
I've been twice
It could be a LOT better if they didn't let so many people in - it's too crowded to a) move b) dance c) drink - basically to have a good time
DON'T GET SUCKERED INTO BUYING A BOTTLE! My group of 3 couples showed up @ 1am and stood in line for maybe 5-10 minutes
When we got to the front we were told that it was a $190 bottle service since we weren't part of a guest list or party
I wasn't even trying to bargain and just said to the bouncer - we'll just go somewhere that we don't have to pay a cover
He looked at me and asked, How many are you? THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED TO SAY
Nevertheless, the place is really different w/ great music
Food was pathetic (you have to pay either $32 or $40 for a prix fixe 3 course meal, and the first two courses are not worth eating (they used canned olives in the salad) -- I like my Lamb Tagine, though)
I heard about the rude service, and they didn't let me down on that
The tip is included for groups, so they didn't need to be nice to us
We weren't in our seats the whole time, and the nasty waitress took away our chairs before dessert, without even asking us, because, you weren't using them anyway
The place was full of people new to the city or to the east village, who don't know New York, and so are satisfied with being pushed around
It seems like it should be fun, but instead it has a really bad vibe
Based on the other reviews here, at least they seem to stay true to their model of nasty and patronizing service combined with subpar and expensive food
This place might have the most obnoxious and arrogant staff around
Who are the clowns that keep coming back to this place?
This place has great ambiance and music but beware! The doorman and staff were extremely rude
Doorman was forcing $190 bottle service the night we were there so he could make some extra cash
Who wants a bottle when your party doesn't all drink the same drink? We ordered a couple drinks from the bar and the bartender automatically kept the $4 change on a $20 bill then disappeared
This place is a con job and I predict it will be gone in a year once the hookah fad ends if they don't improve the way they treat their customers
Do they think they're the only place in NYC?!?!?
We went there around 11 on a Saturday night
The rude bouncer told us he would only let in parties who bought a bottle
We didn't want bottle service
First, a bottle starts at $190
Second, half the people in my party drink gin, half vodka
If I'm paying $190, I want to choose my own drink
The place is fun to dance, but not worth that
I predict it will be gone in a year if they don't start respecting their customers
Hmmm Le Souk
Le Nothing Special
Got there at 130 in which there was a line on a Sat, the bouncers are looking for suckers, trying to con people 2 bottle to get in
On a bonus no cover
I had someone pull me outta line, which is what you need to get in apparently
The downstairs is packed and the lines to the bathroom are long
Upstairs is better in the back room upstairs there is a single bathroom that nobody knows about and lots of room with a bar
It's way dark in here and hot
Too many tables around the outside leave little room in the middle to get your dance on
Con is that you are on 3rd and B
one block east is stab town, so if you are stumbling around make sure you go west young man
I love Le Souk, it's the best place to have dinner, hang out and party in the city
Went for a friends birthday
Were informed that we must all order from the prix fixe menu
I wanted to share and called in advance to clear whether it would be ok to order 7 menus for a table of 8
After passing the rude doorstaff we sat, placed drink orders
waited almost an hour for wine
Were told we could not share one menu and called over the horrible manager
She refused to budge
Waited an hour for our food, munching stale pita bread
The mezze plate was 5 little globs of different spreads
Salad was cheap and flavorless
Plates were scooped up before we swallowed our last bites and we waited an hour for our entrees (bland, tough)
The rest of our party could not get in for a long time, due to their stand in line to make us trendy policy
Dessert was horrible (store bought for sure)
hands down the worst place in NYC
if you have the burning desire to be treated like dirt, go
the worst attitude for the most mediocre place on the east side
awful food, pathetic service and apalling behaviour
the place is run by a bunch of low life thugs and beware
keep people waiting in line outside to give an illusion of exclusivity
here is some advice for the owner
get rid of the sophomoric staff
I was at le souk the other night and had such a great time
I dont really know the village that well so I wasn't sure what to expect
But this place was great
We had a great dinner
The staff was all really nice and accomodating
We were sitting in the front by the door and got cold and they were totally cool about moving us
I have been telling all of my friends about this place not only for dinner, but late at night it turns into a club
great food music ambiance and people!
The food was good, although I only had an appetizer, I didn't hear complaints from my other friends who had entrees
The music was great but only if you like house/techno/pop music
If you are an RB or hip hop head, you won't like the music

yeah specially bad
jack came in and because I wasn't dressed to his liking, he blatantly ignored me when I asked him about his space
Nothing worse than a snobby owner of a small uneventful restaurant
The food's great and the thought of a single chef prepping your food in a tiny homestyle kitchen is charming
It's however not worth the prices menu set
The menu is extremely limited so if you aren't there for the tasting menu or raw bar, you are better off somewhere else
I made the mistake of allowing them to seat me downstairs which is terribly unatmospheric, with plaid red/white walls that need to go away
It was quite bright and had little charm except for folksy-country - which was quite disconnected with the food served and the prices on the menu
For the amount of $ i spent taking my date, I can think of better places to go to, truly
It's not on my list of must go back again
Service was excellent though
So not a 10plus experience -i'd rate it a B
I took a friend there for her birthday
When I made the reservation, I made sure to tell them we were celebrating a birthday and asked them to bring a dessert w/ a candle in it
When we arrived for our 9:00 reservation, we had to wait for 45 minutes
They did not bother to offer us a drink or appetizer while we waited
When we finally sat down and ordered, they brought out the wrong food
I waited for the birthday dessert to arrive and they forgot to bring it out
The attitude was terrible
Not once did they say they were sorry for all of the mistakes
Avoid this place at all costs
priced high so people will think this is a high end restaurant, it's not
The space was small which is ok, I don't mind waiting but the portions were ridiculous, small small small
how do they get away with the price for the size? I don't recommend this place soley on the side of small portions, we were greeted by I would guess the owner Jack and he was way too much to handle
Service was pleasant and two (brothers) waiters tried their best to make us feel comfortable
And we did
A b-day girl wanted a prefix ($80), I wanted to try a raw seafood combo tasting ($100) (8 oysters/ (had better), 8 clams (I normally don't like, but they were really fresh), shrimps (slightly overcooked), scallops,and caviar
MMmmm) and another friend just wanted a la carte (around $65)
Looking and tasting, I think it's a great intro to order prefix menu, if you have never been there
You get to try a little bit of everything
Chefs were great in a tiny space called kitchen, right out side on the second floor dining room
I would recommend, if you like quiet and cozy settings
After calling twice to confirm that we could be seated by 8:30 (I am 8 months pregnant and let them know that I cannot eat too late), we were asked to sit at the bar when we arrived at the restaurant
We waited while sitting on stools in a very cramped space for 20-25 minutes, and were then informed that they overbooked and could not provide us with a table for another hour!!!   We were sent to their new restaurant across the street (a japanese grill restaurant)
Although the food was tasty and the decor is nice, we left hungry ($200 later) and were shocked to find that we were even charged for the one beer that my husband had while waiting at the bar at the original restaurant! Nothing was done to make up for thier outlandish error
Didn't have dinner here, so can't speak to the full menu
But did sit at the bar and had their raw oysters
One word -- CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP
Had their 6 styles of raw oysters, which were just 6 oysters with different sauces -- didnt like it, since I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to raw oysters
But for $14, it was damn cheap
You can order individual oysters for ONLY $2 a piece! How cheap is that
Though I've had fresher oysters elsewhere, you absolutely CANNOT beat the price
The restaurant itself is tiny, so it can feel a bit cramped
My suggestion, eat elsewhere and come here, sit at the bar, and order wine and oyster by the piece
This is NOT a restaurant!!!! first class rip-off more like it
I went there after reading about it, now realize the owners must have known the writer
I can't believe in the mecca of food this place survives
Had the lobster roll and oysters, tiny portion with the taste of the east river
Left hungry!!!!if that wasnt enough the service was awful and rude
save your money and go anywhere but here
Consider yourself warned
Great meal
Overall great and charming place
Only complaint is that they TOTALLY SKIMP out on the glasses of wine
When you order by the glass they fill up maybe half of what any other restaurant would do
It's expensive enough already
buy the bottle and save some cash
Jack has done it again! Oyster fans
please make this place one of your conquests
The seafood was so fresh and delicious, I would be more than happy to return
The decor is as unstuffy as it gets and Dennis (our Captain) was extremely knowledgeable and quick on the draw to refill our champagne glass with the Roset
Overall, I felt that this experience was refreshing and free from all the hype most restaurants coast on
Jack's is a tiny restaurant - and I can see it easily overflowing on a Saturday night - It's a shame that most people's negative comments revolve around not being able to get in to Jack's
I feel great pity for them, as I know what they missed
We were promptly seated and experienced none of the problems mentioned
perhaps we were just plain lucky
The FOOD itself was excellent - Ms
Vines Rushing is destined for greatness - her cooking exudes a beautiful and unique flavoring - a treat for the taste buds
The service is also friendly and excellent
This tiny restaurant provides a very intimate and romantic setting, and I would highly recommend it to all
Will be going back very soon - the menu apparently changes every night
We were seated immediately for our 7:30pm reservation
The service was impecable: attentive and courteous
We got the tasting menu which they were really pushing maybe because of the limited menu
Drink selection is also limited if you are not planning to drink wine
The food was fresh and well prepared and presented beautifully
The Cajun Lobster is a must have
The space is tight and definitely not for the claustrophobic
What is most amazing is how the chef was able to prepare all the meals on the tiny 4 burner stove in a 15 square feet kitchen
Now that's grace under pressure
Went to Jack's last night for a birthday dinner and was very impressed with all aspects of the meal
Sat down right on time upstairs in a cozy room that was very romantic
Had the tasting menu which was absolutely delicious
Other reviews complain about portions, it's a TASTING menu not a Time's Square buffet
Each course was exquisitely prepared and presented
Service was tops as was the presentation, food, wine, etc
Never felt rushed and both of us left full and very satisfied
The oyster rockefeller and lobster courses were sublime
I would without hesitation highly recommend this for a special occasion or just a great and out of the ordinary dining experience
I had a 9:00 p
m
reservation on a recent Saturday night
The restaurant called that afternoon to push it back to 9:30 p
m
, to which I reluctantly agreed
When my group got to the restaurant, we were told that we would be seated at 10:30 p
m
There was no room to wait inside the cramped restaurant, so we left
I was excited to eat at Jack's because some friends had told me that the food was really good
I cannot believe how we were mistreated

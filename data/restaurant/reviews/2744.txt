food is really good for nyc mex but just okay for real down home mexican
has the standard corn w/mayo and cotijo everyone here thinks is exotic but i still recommend trying it if you haven't
most everything on the menu is good - just can't find the value that others seem to see
aside from my gripping, do go! go during happy hour or any time before the night crawling uber hipsters invade
again
The food is good, but the best part is the bartenders
They're better than the free chips and salsa
yummmy!
Hm
The Best food in the world!! Well, since i've been coming here since 1994, the food was soo good since the begining!!i brought my kids there and they said
wow daddy can we go back there for dinner tomorrowcause the food was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the margaritas are the best ever
try the chicken burrito and the queso
oh so good
Went Saturday night with friends and it was oh so good
and cheap!! The superfresh salsa has a little kick and the potato skins stuffed with garlicky spinach are to die for
The were very accomodating about removing the meat from certian dishes to make them vegetarian
My quesadillas were different than what I expected as they came with sauce on the top but it was a pleasant surprise
Despite a slightly snotty server (our waitress was great) I cant wait to hop back on the L train and cruz on over
The margaritas are second to none, offering 7 different flavors, and they taste great out in the garden trying to escape from the heat
The food is also really tasty, always consistent, and huge portions for the price
I would recommend the grilled corn and any of the specials
Absolutly worth the trip to Brooklyn, and the waitstaff is very personable and accomidating even when its busy
Although the margaritas are not quite strong enough, they are TASTY
they put real fruit on the bottom and whatever method they use to make the slushy, creamy-like frozen part is RAD
The best part is, if you go between 4-7 p
m
, they're only $3
50!  I like the food here too, especially their trademark grilled corn on the cob with this amazing mayonaise/chili pepper/parmesan cheese sauce on it -- well, I don't know if that's what's in it but that's my speculation
It's AMAZING and sometimes I go there for dinner and just order a corn on the cob and a frozen margarita
Cheap and delicious!  The service could be better however
but I put up with it for the deliciousness! They have a cute outside garden eating area during the summer too
When my friends and I moved from Texas we REALLY missed Mexican food--now Vera Cruz is NOT Tex-Mex, but it is some of the best Mexican food I have had in NY
If you feel up to it, try the grilled cactus
I've had great meals here and so-so ones
I think the kitchen does better on slower nights
Enchiladas Vera Cruz are nice, as are the tacos
The real draw is the back patio and the wacky margarita flavors
Vera Cruz is fine if you're in the neighborhood, but it isn't worth a special trip
The food is average, the same NYC version of Mexican food you can find all over the city
The outdoor patio is really nice in good weather, but what ambience the indoors possesses is negated by the noise and the crowds
In Short This neighborhood standby has been satisfying appetites for burgers, Greek salads, eggs, waffles and other diner staples for decades
Just east of the BQE, it remains one of the area's only choices for filling your stomach after a late night out
The whole corner space is brightly lit, with blue booths along the windows, counter service and a handy convenience store for food, toiletries and an ATM
I Was surprised! I really liked the food
I had a turkey melt, the turkey was fresh, fries were good
Everyone else I was with enjoyed the food too
The staff is kind of rude
It's open 24 hours, good food, good prices, overall a great find
I really wanted to like Kelloggs
I truly did
with that in mind I will give you a simple review
The options are there
burgers, pancakes,salads
and then you get the food
and it looks like pancakes, burgers etc
but the color is off
like all the colors are dull and pale (when you get your food you will know what I mean) and then you taste your food and the food is off
So you order a pancake, it looks like a pancake
but the taste is never quite what you expect
the food all tastes like it was frozen
*oh yea there is also a little store that is attached to the diner
I bought a nestle crunch ice cream bar
and even THAT was weird tasting! No joke
Kelloggs is the perfect place for late night cravings
It is open 24 hours which makes it the perfect late night spot
Although it is not rated good for groups I dissagree
Kelloggs has large booths that fit 6 people
I had a great time because I was in good company
Fair prices good diner food
Although the cheesecake didn't taste like cheescake and the homefires were horrible, overall my friends love this place and they love the food
so go for it
P
S the weightress that night was horrible! She gave us the check as soon as she saw we were done with what we ordered
We were just started
We sat there with the check and ordered dessert and more drinks
She had to keep adding to the check
very rude!!
it is open 24/7 so you can get some food after coming from a bar at 5 in the morning
this is the only way i could eat the food there (being drunk, tired and starved)
and the stuff is really rude! not just one staff member
they all are unfriendly, no matter what time you go there
In Short This unadorned cafe has the feel of a college-town coffeehouse, liberally sprinkled with beards, bangs and butch haircuts
Fans line up for takeout pastries, bagels and self-serve coffee, and sit down to lunches of steamed eggs, hummus platters and BLTs with "fakin' bacon
" While the Pixies blast over the speakers, resilient freelancers stay tuned into their laptops
The backyard provides a relaxing alternative, with wood-planked walls, climbing vines and umbrella-topped tables
I have been to Phoebe's maybe 5 times in the past 6 years and just went today and was impressed by the expanded menu
I had an awesome tofu sandwich that made my day
The garden is really nice, and overall the experience was very relaxing
A slice of Bedford Ave hipster action, but a little less pretentious and a modicum more friendly
The food is good (the granola and oatmeal are fantastic) and not too expensive (the Garden Grill across the way is a much better value and far less pretentious
In fact, that word has probably never crossed the lips of the saucy Polish waitress there)
I don't think it's horrible, but if you want more healthy breakfast fair in this neighborhood you'll have to make it at home
Garden is the biggest plus
Waitstaff=sometimes great, sometimes lackluster, sometimes awful
Waitstaff can barely be troubled to take your order and the place smells like a stale ashtray
No amount of art-hip can cover that up
The one positive thing is the outdoor seating
Yeah I've binged here a buch
The slices are a little small and expensive, but if you want to get drunk on pizza I highly recommend it

As is typical of such restaurants, the cusine does not warrant the high prices
The cheese course, however, is fun
Tightly spaced tables
Stuffy (jacket required)
A full dinner for two (with wine) is easily $300
Be sure to check the menu before you go; depending on the night, it's quite possible you will find few dishes of interest
Extremely expensive and boring food
If good food is what you seek, take your money elsewhere
Why we keep giving this local diner a second chance is beyond us
Each time, the food is mediocre, the atmosphere lacking charm, and the service is UNSPEAKABLY BAD
This Sunday, we experienced the worst treatment ever
We don't expect much at diners, except for courtesy and a coffee refill
We received our food and coffee at the same time, and couldn't get the attention of any waiter to refill our cups
Finally, our cups were refilled when the waiter (after a fifteen minute wait) dropped off our change
Less than 5 minutes later, the manager came by, asking if we were doing ok
She then told us that there was a line for tables, and asked us to leave
Nonetheless, we left the diner, told the manager that we would not return, and have finally decided that this horrible local diner does NOT deserve one more chance
This has been my WORST New York restaurant experience ever
The servers and management have no clue about customer service
Dont be fooled by a new interior and plans for an outdoor caf; this staff is rude, impatient and apathetic
As one who works in the hospitality industry trust me when I say, AVOID THIS PLACE
I will never dine here again
Or at least that's what the menu at this neighborhood 'Chinese restaurant seems to offer
The prices a little on the high side for takeout but considering the neighborhood it's in, not too bad
They often run specials on their sushi menu if you're eating in and will make almost any dish with a tofu subsitution at your request
In Short Teeming with shapely bodies, this health food haven could easily be mistaken for a health club commissary
Wheat grass and carrot juices are served at the bar, and vegetarian dishes are the norm in the dining room, where you'll also find grilled fish, tuna burgers and organic chicken sausage
Be prepared for the occasional celebrity sighting
In spite of recent restaurant rennovation, there is a sense that the owners forgot to focus on one important thing, quality and service to the diners
The food was mediocre at best, and the staff was very much focused on selling rather than servicing
Overall, Josie's has lost it's appeal and has become another pretentious restaurant
I am hoping this can be improved and that the owner reads this column
The food is catered towards your health and is delicious, but that won't help the mental state you'll be in after leaving
The crowd is pretentious and obnoxious, as are the waitstaff (and especially the hostess) and they're all crammed next to you
An assault on the senses, but really good dishes
Maybe get stuff to go and eat in the park instead?
Organic Food For Everyone! Great for Vegeterians, Vegans Meat Eaters, too! Food was excellent, but slow from the kitchen
All food is cooked to order, so when it does come from the kitchen, it is hot wonderful! Well worth the wait! A wonderful selction of fresh breads is brought around in a basket while waiting for dinner
Yum!
I've been going to Josie's with my girlfriend for years
The food and service is always consistent and I never leave disappointed
There's a little bit of everything for everybody whether you want something light and fresh like a salad or a nice hearty meal like pasta or a hamburger
My favorites are the chili seared shrimp appetizer, Macadamia chicken salad, yukon gold potato dumplings, maple turkey breast wrap, seared yellowfin tuna burger and for dessert you have to do the lemon ribbon pie (if you're a fan of ice cream) or for the wintery months, the healthy pumpkin pie made with tofu
It's DIVINE!!
My wife I went here for brunch and the food was both healthy delicious
We each started with fresh squeezed juice(4 ingredients)
I had the Josie's special egg dish with organic beef fresh veggies
My wife had healthy pancakes made with egg whites, bananas macadamia nuts
very tasty! Highly recommended!
Just experienced the worst service at Josie's restaurant on the upper west side
Took 1 hour and 15 minutes for our entrees to be served
After I inquired why the food was taking so long, the waitress told us that the 2 dishes we ordered take a long time
(but never mentioned this when we ordered) After another 30 minutes, we spoke to manager who said that these 2 dishes could take up to 20-30 minutes
but we waited OVER 1 hour
When the food arrived it was luke warm and chicken was over cooked
DO NOT RECOMMEND for both poor service and poor taste
Josie's rocks! I went with 5 friends (2 vegetarians, a vegan, and 2 devout carnivores) and we had the best time
the menu selection offers something for everyone - and to those who write that it tastes like cardboard it's a damn shame they can't get over the healthy but tasty part and choose to live in denial! don't miss this healthy-delicious heaven
and the drinks too
highly recommend
As others have mentioned, this is a place to spot stars
However, heaven help you if one of them has a reservation following yours
One hour into our dinner, we were told by the hostess that we needed to hurry up and finish so that they could accommodate the next party's reservation
Busboys stood behind our chairs
Our dishes were taken away before we were even done
We held on for desert
Bad move
Stay away from the apple pie! Cardboard has better flavor
Our server, however, was wonderful
She really understood her organic/natural foods, explained everything thoroughly and was truly outstanding
Total time spent at dinner: 1 hour 45 minutes
Sure enough, a stretch limo pulled up just as we were being pushed out the door
Josie's has been my all-time favorite for years
The salads are great and the stirfry with tofu is delightful with the most flavorful tamari brown rice ever
For non-vegetarians, the Macadamia crusted chicken salad is a must-have along with their wraps and burgers, and last but not least, for dessert the Lemon ribbon ice cream pie is absolutely YUMMY! You're bound to have some celebrity sightings, Josie's is frequented by Kevin Bacon and his wife, Kyra Sedgwick
Also saw America's Next Top Model winner Yoanna House swinging by to pick up a delivery menu
Guess she prefers dining in
Thank you Josie's: you have taught me that healthful food can taste great! I know I can bring any of my friends here and ANYONE can find something they will love
The hostess on my last visit was adorable and made us feel so welcome - how could you not just love Josie's?
to all reviewers: do not buy the nonesense you read so far! this place rocks and anyone who claims otherwise probably doesn't understand what this place is about
we usually expect healthy to taste like cardboard, right? well, josies makes healthy taste like heaven! organic, free-range, dairy-free, and vegan options that rate higher than the regular stuff on my palette
do not miss this place!
I LOVE this place
For a while, my husband and I were going there every week
They have the BEST apple martini's in town
So many different options too
I always get the salmon with wasabi sauce and cous cous
My husband has tried almost everything on the menu
The specials are always very good too
A fun place where you can be yourself and have great conversation!! A great date place, or to gather a groups of friends!
i've had worse dining experiences, but that's not saying much
the food is a very uncreative (and flavorless) take on healthy eating
the wait staff were pleasant but not efficient, except the bussers and runners
healthy eating does not have to be so bland
I always have a great time whenever I go to Josie's
The food is always so fresh and tasty and yummy
The attention is great; the place is cozy, warm and fun at the same time
It can be a bit pricey but it is worth every penny spent
I specially looove the apple crumb dessert with the soy vanilla ice cream!  Everyone should experience it at least once!
I wouldn't recommend this place to even my worst enemy

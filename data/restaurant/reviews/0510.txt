Make sure your waiter brings you all the things that come with your brunch, including juice and coffee
The cactus juice is an experience, too! Love the painted murals and the colorful atmosphere
Haven't been for dinner, but it looks less veg-friendly
I think this place is great
The food is great, the atmosphere is great, and the service is great
It is a nice place to eat brunch but the dinner is awesome too! Also, they are available for private parties
I threw one there and everyone was telling how cool the place looked and how tasty the food was
Go there!
After about a 20 minute wait (not bad for Sundy at 12:30), we were seated and served very quickly
The food was excellent (I had the french toast, my companion had the quesadillas), the coffee good, and the wait staff friendly and attentive
Until it was time to get the check
But by then we were satisfied from the meal so it was ok, although it could explain the slower-than-necessary turnover
Overall, the noshing patrons all seemed pleased with their meals
Recommend it on a nice day where it's ok to wait outside, especially if you're already in Park Slope
Everyone tells us this is their favorite place for brunch, so we were excited to try it
We went one time and didnt have a good experience (the food and service was sub par), so we just thought it was just an off-day on their part, and went back again
Now
never again - its just not good! Save your money and go somewhere else
theres plenty of other joints in the hood
The cuban sandwich and duck empanadas were great
Not kid focused, like one reviewer said before
They had 2 highchairs and one was broken, but I will definitely go back
Excellent food, generous portions, great value
Despite the hectic Sunday brunch crush, the staff were super friendly and accomodating
Excellent food, vegetarian-friendly, usually good service
The old-timers there are excellent--a couple of the newer wait staff are morons who can't seem to find the coffee in time for it to arrive before you leave
Some of the best brunch food we've ever had!
Great brunch! The food is always good, the prices are right and contrary to what others have said, I have always gotten quick and attentive service
I like the Latino-fusion cuisine there, it beats the boring normal eggs benedict-type menus
The servers are almost always stoned
Very, very stoned
As a result, they are laid back, friendly and S-L-O-W
Aside from that and a menu priced about $2
00 too high on all items, Beso does not disappoint
Sunday brunch is a spectacular feast of breakfast plates you've only dreamt about
The mangu con huevos is phenomenal and they've got great fresh squeezed juice
Dinner is okay - not many vegetarian options, and the portions are small
But the desserts! Try every single one of them and I dare you to pick a favorite
I had a tough time, but settled on the churro
Cinnamon and chocolate heaven! The coffee is also quite good
It's a wonderful place to be for brunch
Food is always great, specials are inventive, and the space is large, colorful, and fun to be in
Kids ae welcome, but it's not kid-focused
Great, pleasantly spiced, Hispanic-inflected dishes
Brunch is the big meal here, with the eggs Benedict, pleasantly laced with cayenne and yuca home fries topping the list of delicacies
During hot weather, the store front lifts to leave the whole space out in the open air (but not in the blistering sun)
In Short High ceilings, exposed-brick walls and fresh flowers give this long-standing local diner a cosmetic edge over its coffeehouse competitors
The cluster of booths up front is followed by a long sit-down counter, then a larger dining area in back
All day and all night, customers choose from a lengthy and international list of entrees: Romanian steak, Virginia baked ham and omelettes indebted to Ireland, Italy, Mexico and Spain
It's OK
Not great diner food, but it's there and it's 24 hours
In a word, meh
In Short With its narrow, wood counter seating three people max and but one chair accompanying the sole metal table, this Carribean mini-cafe is first and foremost about takeout
Customers line up in the white-washed brick and sunflower-yellow interior to order jerk chicken, curried goat or tiger shrimp to go
Meatless variations on island classics (like curried tofu, vegetarian stew and rasta pasta) make this a welcome culinary option for vegans as well
This place is horrendous compared to the place Jamaican place I go to all the time where I work in Downtown Brooklyn (Ammette Cafe)
The chicken tasted like turkey and just wasn't good jerk at all
The rice and peas was bland
The guys there are really laid back
so laid back that they don't answer the phone half the time
and are pretty rude when they do answer
I don't recommend this place at all
Nice food, nice people, and the worst sense of timing ever
I know they're small and slow, but this is ridiculous
We ordered, he told me it would be maybe 40 minutes, and then they arrived an hour and 40 minutes later
When I called to check in, the guy acted annoyed at me, like, we're BUSY but
maybe a few bucks off or an apology is in order? Won't be buying from them again
And oh, by the way, the credit card machine has been broken for at least a month
The other Brawta in Boerum Hill is 100% more organized and professional than this place and possibly more delicious too
Warm and gracious staff will pack up a bit of the carribean for you to take home
The food is authentic Jamacian and delicious; you can tell it is cooked with love! For about 35 dollars two of you can have a feast with leftovers
Five bucks gets you a decent helping of rice and beans with your choice of meat: steak (bistec), pork, chicken - and on Saturdays, barbacoa (barbecued goat)
Another thing to look forward to during the weekend is champurrado - a delicious drink made with water, cinnamon, masa harina (Mexican corn masa mix), some brown sugar and chocolate
Tis yummy I tell ya
Another fave dish during this killer cold weather is panciteria (red tripe soup)
Fast and Fresh is also a bodega, and they have the usual offerings: cold drinks in the fridge (Corona and other beers available), bagels, sammiches and salads to order
This place is my favorite deli/bodega and I eat here at least once a day
In the summer, they open the small garden in the back (with tables natch) and you can have your meals there
This is wonderful, fresh brick oven pizza
The pasta, sandwiches and calzones are fabulous as well, and the service is good
It's often crowded and noisy, but the waiters are kind and accomodating
Worth the trip to Bay Ridge
This is a nice sushi restaurant in Brooklyn that's located on 86 street, right underneath the train station
The decor is designed in a contemporary Japanese style restaurant
The food is good, the teriyaki I recommend
The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people, but I didn't like the fact they used artifical lobster meat
Overall, this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent
It's nice to find a place that is open 24 hours (especially in downtown Brooklyn)
The food is great and the milkshakes are even better!
With everything else closed in the Heights after midnight apart from the bars, it's good to have a classic 24-hour diner
It's feels like a greasy-spoon kind of place, but the food is better than that
It is what it is
I'm not sure I'd go here often for a regular meal, but at 3 AM, it can't be beaten
Happy Days Diner is a nice restaurant to hangout in
The atmosphere is 1950's but a burger won't cost you 10 cents
The place is great except that it doesn't have an A/C
In Short Operating since 1960, Domino's is best known for its delivery service and pizzas arrive hot, thanks to the company's plugged-in HeatWave delivery-bag technology
Build your own pie--add toppings to either Ultimate Deep Dish, Crunchy Thin Crust or Classic Hand Tossed styles--or select a Feast Pizza, like the MeatZZa Feast, topped with pepperoni, ham, beef and Italian sausage
Build a meal with side orders like Amazin' Greens salads, Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix
why??? would you order dominos when you have the best independent pizza in the world nearby

Also, the service wasn't that great
It kind of ruined the atmosphere to see the owner yelling and screaming at all the waitstaff the whole night
Maybe we'll try it again in a few months
This resturant is by far, one of THE best resturants I've ever eaten at
The ingredients are so fresh and the flavors so intense but not overwhelming
It was a delightful evening of fantastic food, inviting ambiance and a welcoming staff
Had a horrendous experience on a Wednesday night at Happy Hour
Waitress was overwhelmed by 3 tables
Took 30 minutes to get all 3 appetizers
All came room temperature
No attempt made to compensate for the riduculous wait
Explanation, our order was given to another table
Will make sure we give our business to another restaurant
The Scene The Delancey Street nighttime hustle quiets down on Suffolk, where apartments and low-cost housing loom over this block's sole eating establishment
Although the evenings-only Soy is mostly suited for takeout, the small, unpretentious interior is perfect for a contemplative, solo dinner or a quick, casual bite with a friend
The Food The restaurant's name may sound like a purely vegetarian oasis, but this homestyle Japanese cookery serves several meat dishes and fish specials in addition to its exquisite tofu and vegetable entrees and side dishes
Warm, subtle flavors grace every bite, from appetizers like gomoku-mame--soybeans delicately simmered with shiitake mushrooms, burdock, and carrots--to curry rice, a thick, savory beef and potato stew
Treasure sacks--fried tofu pouches with a vegetable filling--are highly addictive
This place is great but a bit small
Real deal Japanese home cooking food
Don't expect to see sushi on the menu
It is not a sushi or yakitori joint
My only complain is the small portion
BYOB
Beyond excellent
I've been here a couple times; every dish I've had has been beyond belief
You can get an entree for around $7
When it comes, you'll think it isn't enough food, but it is! It is remarkably filling and satisfying
I recommend her soy smoothies
If you have never tried Japanese homestyle cooking, it's worthy(you'll know what they serve)
But if you are Japanese food lover, it's waste of your time and money
Honestly, I have no idea why people gives them high rating
After hearing good things about the restaurant, I finally decided to try the food
Needless to say, I was highly disappointed
It did not live up to expectation
While the restaurant seem to be a one woman operation, service was still considered to be very slow
Since there was only one customer finishing up
I expected my order to be filled quickly
For what I considered to be simple dishes, Gyoza, Milk Shake, and Miso Pork, the whole order took over 30 mins to fill
Though I am not an expert in cooking, I am certain the food was not made fm scratch at the time of the order
Taking over 30 mins to fill an order of 3 simple dishes is seriously unacceptable
After having tasted the food, I have to say, it was not worth the wait
I rarely order anything aside from the daily specials at soy, but the kenchin jiru and miso soups are great for fighting colds and flu
The veggie gyoza are superb as well as the spinach with sesame sauce
My favorite item, however, was a special soup that I've only seen there once, which was a tomato lentil
Hopefully she'll make it again!
Great Japanese food
not just vegetairian, daily specials are awsome
Soy is able to enlighten people who have misconceptions about Japanese food; some people believe that the only common Japanese food is Sushi
This is not true
This restaurant serves real Japanese home cooking that is healthy, hearty and delicious
The Scene Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint
Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night
A small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends
The Food Generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the Jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and Mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious
Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and spices
Fresh smoothies and juices perfectly complement the food, and although the soups and french fries feel store-bought, the gooey mozzarella sticks are the perfect midnight nosh
The basic breakfast here is the perfect solution for every hang over
For $4
25 you get eggs, potatoes, a bagel, and coffee
For another $2, there is a large, fresh squeezed orange juice
I usually get 2 large orange juices
I've always found delivery to be propmt
I would highly recommend this place for decent quality, inexpensive food
I just had probably my worst dining experience in NYC
The French burger had a tiny smudge of goat cheese, the Mexican burger's avocado spread had that rotten avocado taste, the fries were clearly Ore-Ida, and the jalapeno poppers were frozen in the middle
Plus it was dirty, smelly, and the outdoor area felt like a beach bathroom
This place cant be beat for after hours burgers onion rings
Although the service is a bit slow, everything is made fresh and every single thing is made to order
What's also great is that no matter how late u eat, the food here is healthy enough that you wont feel like you swallowed a stone when you wake up the next morning
So this is the only place that was opened late at night, and it used to be decent food
Just tried ordering from them again, now that they're under new management
It took them 45mins to deliver, the burgers weren't what I remembered and the wings were soggy
Then to top that off, the delivery person complains about the tip and asked for more
very rude
I would rather have cold cereal then order here again
The veggie, turkey, regular burgers are phenomenal, especially now with the different burgers of the world toppings you can get
The wraps are also terrific
The service ambiance aren't the best, but for take-out or delivery you can't lose
it's 3am, friday night, i'm tired, and i just got home from work
called rush hour and ordered a couple burgers to have a late snack with a friend
waited 45 minutes after ordering, then called back
it's on its way
2 minutes the voice on the other side said
20 minutes later, my friend now passed out on the couch, still no food, i called back
i'm sorry, i'm sorry, there's been a mistake
we're closed now
my manager's not here
someone took your order
after a while, all the excuses blended together
just another person trying to pass the buck
i will never order form this place again
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MEDITERRENIAN RESTAURANTS IVE BEEN TO
I AM TURKISH AND I UNDERSTAND ABOUT TURKISH FOODS AND THIS ONE IS JUST TOO GOOD
VERY COZY AND VERY FRIENDLY PEOPLE THERE
FAMILY OWNED AND GREAT SERVICE THERE
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
If you've ever been to Guatemala, you'll recognize the sound of the chefs making real corn tortillas as soon as you walk in the door
The food is the real deal - authentic to a T, it's all made right there, and it brings back memories of the countryside
The restaurant lacks any form of ambience and the area can seem a bit scary if you've never been to Newark

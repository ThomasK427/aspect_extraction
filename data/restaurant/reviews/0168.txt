Orsay, is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food, and French service as well
Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x
Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed
Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC
We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu
Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience)
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation
Food is ok and pretty expensive but you can't beat the atmosphere, especially during the summer
Greeted by a beautiful, knowlegable and friendly hostess, given a choice of inside or outside and seated according to our reservation time (within 10 minutes)
The service was great, an informed waiter, good drinks and beautifully served and prepared food
Especially the salads
They did not rush us-we sat too long-but the ambience of carved ceilings and wood and old glass was delightful to be ensconced by
So till next time au revoir
I went for an early dinner the other night and encountered the worst service i have experienced in a long time
Not only did i go for an early dinner and was therefore one of two tables eating at the time, I was also part of a small party
We didn't order for about a half hour and not once did we order a drink from our original waiter, in fact every drink we ordered came from a bus boy
It took just as long to order our dessert, however by this time we had learned our lesson and did not wait for the waiter instead we physicaly got up from the table and found another waiter to take our order
Needless to say the whole ordeal took well over 2 hours
Not to mention I could find better french food in about ten neighboring venues for half the price
The place still looks upper east side nice and the food can be okay - although the last time I was there the mussels were unexciting
It is the service that has gone downhill to the point were we will not go back
The waiter placed the wrong entree in front of us each time
It was like an auction by dessert
When ordering he was not paying attention and had to ask us to repeat our order since he was looking out the window
Quite the best cauliflower soup and mussels I have ever had! Outstanding food and service make this a must visit
Great selection of tartares
Margarita tartare was excellent
Unfortunately, the service was pitiful, the waiter was rude and the entree was mediocre at best
A beautiful restaurant, Orsay could almost be an authentic bistro straight out of Paris
Filled with beautiful people, this place is a scene
Just be ready to pay the price for it
Some dishes were a bit disappointing
I was walking down Lexington looking for a nice restaurant to take my girlfriend to, in order to celebrate her promotion
We randomly walked into Orsay and were greeted by phenomenally attentive service, amazing wine and some of the best French food I have ever tasted
We ended up lingering for hours over there amazing desserts
Although the bill was significant it wasn't nearly as significant as the experience
I recommend it to everyone
Expensive? Yes
Crowded? Yes
A Scene? Yes
Delicious food? Yes!  Dine on the outdoor patio during the summer months and you will feel as if you are in Paris
Relax, enjoy the meal, spend some time talking with friends while you drink your red wine
This is not a quick hitting, cheap dining experience, but a nicely paced, culinary pleasure
The price may relegate this place to special occasions or for those times when you can truly 'relax' and enjoy a fine meal
Walked in , was rudely greeted by the hostess (who's attitude was lacking)
we were then placed next to a raucous table for 15 when there were several available tables on a Saturday night
THEN
I take one look at the menu to only notice the $10
50 onion soup???Im not one to be concerned about expensive restaurants
but c'mon
It was the icing on the cake after the rude hostess sat us
we walked right out
A place where that I can eat french confot food, in a friendly true to the cord bistro where eating at the bar takes me back home to Paris
Must try the no frills tartars! When home sick it is just the place I need
Don't go for the food- go if you want a loud and lively scene in a fabulous, true bistro atmosphere
I've had outstanding lobster salad, served properly chilled, and Dover Sole served improperly chilled! Ouch- at $35 I think the fish should at least be warm
Friends have had similar situations, something is great one visit and horrible the next
The service is confusing, waiters are buzzing all over the place, but you are never sure who your waiter is
However, even when they are jammed (which is most of the time) they do manage to get you seated within a reasonable amount of time
The one constant are the bartenders- they are attentive, efficient and personable even with thirsty patrons three deep
Orsay is an event in itself, but not fine dining
Popped in on a Friday night for dinner
Matt Dillon was dining at a table just adjacent
Nice wine by the glass
Oysters were some of the best that I have had
The tuna tartare is great
And the cheese plate for dessert was a nice finish
One of the better Upper East Side bistros
The Scene Small details lend soul to the spare interior, which is built almost entirely of blond wood
Sake, for example, is served on miniature bamboo mats, while soy sauce arrives in a pouring vessel that could pass for a family heirloom
The room is usually quiet and subdued, with the attention set squarely on the food
The Food Omakase meals allow the sushi chef to really work his magic, perhaps starting off with a variety of tuna sashimi, ranging from firm to fully fleshy, from lean to fatty
Seasonal seafood can include buttery scallops; oily but notably unfishy needlefish; wild Alaskan white salmon; and both river and sea eal, served together for comparative tasting
As at the more serious sushi bars, each bite is perfectly seasoned by the sushi chef--no need for the soy sauce dish here
Dessert is a satisfyingly simple dish of sorbet or tea
I tried Yasuda for the second time, but I still didn't get it
Their sushi and sashimi were really good, without a doubt, but one of the best sushi I ever had in New York? Hmm
Maybe my expectation had been too high
Or, maybe I am too conservative when it comes to sushi
If you're looking for some completely outstanding sushi, Yasuda is your place
The salmon, tuna, and whitefish in particular were absolutely excellent
the tuna was the reddest tuna I have ever seen, they all had perfectly smooth textures, and were just perfect
Really amazing sushi
My only complaint is that if you eat later (our reservation was at 9:30pm), they tend to be out of some of the fish, including a salmon that I really wanted to try and a couple others
So I would recommend getting an early table (call at least a couple days or a week in advance)
Also, their non-sushi selection is pretty minimal, so it is a great place to take hard-core sushi fans, but that's about it
And they don't have very many rolls
I've heard that if you sit at the sushi bar, you can request rolls, but if you're at a table, the rolls are just the fish wrapped in seaweed with rice (which is still good, but I really love creative rolls)
But still, the fish is amazingly fresh and it is outstanding sushi
just don't expect much else
Never in my life have I experienced a more pleasureable or sublime eating experience
Every meal at Yasuda immediately enters the top twenty meals of all time for me
My wife and I go there for special occasions


we can't afford it as often as we like
But the high price is well worth it
Ask for omakase from Yoshi-san

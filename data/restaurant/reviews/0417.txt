The drinks were quite expensive ($6 for a Sugarhill beer), but I was prepared for that
The outdoor patio was very cool, quiet and beautiful
After we finished our drinks, the waiter invited us to tour the rest of the resturaunt! We will definitely be back for dinner soon
Also, I have no idea what's up with some other posters' derisive comments about the neighborhood
We live down the block and love our neighborhood, thank you!
Reading the reviews, we were in for a bumpy ride
You're definitely not in Kansas, Dorothy: the front door is locked - you must be buzzed in
Untrained waiter; drinks the first sign of trouble: straight up comes with ice, they're all out of Bloody Marys-- except for appearing on the bill
3 entrees, all 3 signature potato sides, sold out by 8pm; squash soup, crab cake excellent; salmon, duck, cornish hen, vegetable ravioli, desserts: just fine
Unisex restroom/antique toilet a disaster
If you go with good friends, as we did, you'll still have a wonderful time, memorable for some good and many laughable reasons
I visited The Sugar Hill Bistro 12/14/02 and loved it! I found it to be an elagant yet homey dining experience, with the renovated brownstone evoking the atmospher of the Harlem Renaissance
The Cornish Hen I had that night was scrumptuous and the apple pie was to die for
I had a great server who was prompt and very efficient
I hope they fix the things that have garnered them bad reviews, because I'm so happy to see a restuarant of such elegance and class in the Harlem area
I have never had a dining experience where the food was so good and the service was so horrible
We had reservations but they sat us in the downstairs lounge without apology
Waited 20 minutes for menus (they ran out) and over an hour until we saw our first appetizer
They ran out of THREE of the items we ordered and had to make us re-order
One of the four guests was brought the wrong entree and they tried to talk him into just eating it instead
We were charged for dishes we never ordered when the bill came
There was some discussion amongst our table that we were actually on candid camera
Way to expensive a restaurant for such silliness
Now, depsite all of this, the food was so good that it was almost worth it
Amazing salads, fish, sweet potatoes
I'd suggest trying them on a non-weekend
What? heading WAY up there for brunch? Tho, it's worth it
i thought it was a bit expansive (approx
$50
for two), but their mac cheese was YUMMY! their brunch menu had something for everyone
jazz singer had a nice voice + she made us all get up to dance to shake some cals to eat some more
the owner/waiter seem to know many locals + treated some new comers like their old friends
it was a very warm experience
during busy hrs, i recommend that you make a reservation
The food was tasteless! I had to put salt and pepper on it to be able to eat even some of it! I waited 35 minutes for an appetizer and the place was empty! There was a nice bartender named Brian I think but the management staff is horrible and they act like they don't want people to ever come back! Don't worry I won't!!!!!!!!!
Quite an anachronistic restaurant in the midst of 145th street
I was pleasantly surprised at the comfortable jazzy ambiance and the regal treatment my date and I received
Another couple was apparantly having a special dinner night with rose petals adorning their lavishly decorated table
Being in the same room howerver, our smaller table was also adorned with rose petals
The Escolar and sweet potataoes were fantastic and my only complaint was the bread that was served in the beginning was a tad bit burned
Otherwise a smashing evening with pleasant service
I prefer down town for sure, but would dine here again
I used to go to Figaro when I was a kid
It was still a slice of bohemia - a lone guitarist would strum and croon in the corner and the kitchen would dole out tasty far like apples and cheese over hearty brown bread
I went about two years ago and was horrified by the changes
Figaro is certainly catering to the throngs of tourists
We waited 40 minutes - to get COFFEE! I decided to give it another chance during evening hours and was again disappointed
The food was mediocre and the ambiance that I so loved is just a memory
Wadded up balls of aluminum foil in my guest's food, and shards of hard plastic in mine, we were more than surprised with the lack of responsibility of this cafe!
The Scene Part bistro, part brasserie, the cheerful Les Halles Downtown is ideal for anyone who finds pleasure in beef, pork, potatoes or a good glass of Gigondas
Patrons chat in soupy French at the weathered room-length bar, while groups dine at butcher paper-covered tables set with thick-handled steak knives
Servers are friendly but rushed
The Food Les Halles plays the same bistro classics as its Park Avenue South parent, but with slightly less of an emphasis on beef
The results are mixed--good bets include escargots, which arrive sizzling in garlic butter, and an archetypal frisee aux lardons loaded with smoky chunks of bacon
Frites are impeccably cooked, and the shell steak with which they're served is reliably good
Both the tartiflette, a gratin-like serving of Reblochon, potatoes and bacon, and a duck confit shepherd's pie are hit-or-miss
Desserts are perfunctory
The food here is consistently pretty good
I love their moules et frites
all the sauces are parfait for dipping your fries in
They also have a good mac and cheese, frisee salad, and egg dishes (for brunch)
Unfortunately the service here is consistently bad
I frequently go here thinking the service might one day get better, but it has not
Even when the restaurant is not busy durring the weekend, or day times, the waiters are slow
Last time I went, my friend and I were charged prix fixe prices even though we didn't get the fixed menu
They always correct their mistakes, but the keep making them time after time
I would not reccomend this place if you are a stickler for service
If you don't mind waiting a while for decent food, check it out
it's not like there's much of a choice in this neighborhood
i work right around the corner and we often go for happy hour
it is always packed and the service is usually slow as a result
however, the steak frites is excellent and everything else is usually pretty great too
standouts include croque monsieur, chocolate mousse, and the cotes du rhone they have by the glass (fantastic)
So where to begin?? Waiting half an hour past our reservation time? Only 7 places set for 8 diners? Only getting 7 of our 8 drink orders? One diner having to ask for cutlery four times? Someone breaking a tray of dishes not once, not twice, but three times? It felt like we were in some episode of I Love Lucy! One of our group tried to lighten the mood by applauding the clumsy wait staff (Lets here it for them ladies and gentlemen!) He got accosted by a waiter who yelled in his face, We take pride in our jobs
They take pride in such terrible service?? I would hate to have such low self esteem
As for the food, well my steak was chewy
My frites were limp and not fabulous
The champagne was good, but that can hardly be credited to this sad excuse for a restaurant
This is the kind of neighbordhood place you can eat at every night
Simple, tasty French menu has perennial appeal
Solid, affordable wine list
This is the place I go when I'm tired of the pomp and circumstance that sometimes mars the eating out experience
Service was incredibly slow and the food was indifferent at best
Knew we were in trouble when the waiter spilled our cocktails on the table and couldn't be bothered to bring new silverware
Les Halles is a great place to find a reasonably priced, excellent steak
I've gone there three times over the past two months and every time, the service has been outstanding
Try the hanger steak - it's the best deal, and their fries are amazing
I've eaten in both Manhattan versions of this restaurant in the past have enjoyed everything on every occasion
but my luck ran out
I can safely say I had the worst dining experience of the last 7 years in Les Halles Downtown last night
The waitress/waiter service was all but non existent
Only once during the entire course of our visit did we manage to get the attention of someone masquerading as a waitress (having been sitting unattended for over 30 mins) and then her attitude was appalling
The food was then rushed unappealing never once were we asked if we'd like a a second bottle of water let alone a second drink
It's a pity because these restaurants have so much to offer
but when you see this level of apathy and rudeness and then have the pleasure of having to pay, I'll take my chances somewhere else
The food is basically the same and just as delicious as at the Park Ave
Les Halles
The escargots are a good choice and they gave my husband more sauce on his pork tenderloin than they have lately at the other location
The atmosphere here is a bit different but the quality is comparable
As a fan of the Les Halles in the Flatiron district, I was expecting much of it's downtown sibling

what could be better? Drawback: sometimes the service is s-l-o-w
Belly Delly is a great place for casual breakfast or lunch if you're looking for value and a true NY experience
You can get sandwiches, eggs, etc
from the counter or they have a big buffet of great fresh food
The guys at the counter are very friendly, personable and funny - remembered us and what we ate when we went back the next morning
This is a great alternative to the high-priced stuffy hotel restaurants
You can watch Broadway from the upstairs dining area (no waitresses, just take your food up there)
Husband, kids I all loved it! Happy Dining! :-)
The fat-free tuna alone is enough to make you want to come back every day to this Broadway hotspot
With incredible service and the hottest, crispiest bacon, the Belly does not disappoint
I love to get some nice cutlet or lentil soup that makes the work week so sweet
I love to eat sandwiches at the Belly more than I love myself and the workers are among the hottest in the city
The upstairs view of the tae-kwon do dojo makes the atmosphere totally rad and cool and makes me totally flip out
The Belly Delly Deli, or B Dilly as it is known, is one of the finest sandwich experiences in the whole of NYC
The men behind the counter, Yassir, Wonderboy Junior, Nazi, and the Fourth Dimension craft your sandwich with speed and precision, but most of all with love
The choices are endless and there is an extensive buffet/salad bar for those of you who like to pick and choose
The dining room upstairs offers unmatched ambience
I highly recommend the Belly as the place to fill your belly come lunchtime
Pickles for all!
Huge menu -- great food and service
The breakfast was delicious and very reasonable for Manhattan
Would go back there anytime
We visited here after reading some reviews
Believe me for $13 plus I would like more than just a large sandwich
(that's it, no chips, fries, etc
) The food was good, but not at all worth the price
You could easily spend over $50 here for lunch for two on average food
The service left something to be desired too
The best part of this experience was sitting by the window and watching Broadway go by
Also there is a great deal of talk about these huge barrel pickles you get
Well, they are the same size as you would get in any jar
I would not go here again
In reviewing the website for Scala, they advertise a pre-theater menu for $34
95
On my first visit, I had this menu with the mesculine salad, the baby lamb chops and dessert, plus a great wine
And you couldn't beat the price! So being here on business I decided to return the next week
On my second visit I was told the pre-theater was no longer available
I had the lamb and 1 glass of wine and it was MORE than the original meal, not to mention was not as good
Also while I was there another patron complained that her pizza was frozen
Will not return here
In my opinion ,scala is a valuable addition to the midtown repertoire of restaurants adding stylishly casual variety to a neighborhood saturated with corporate haunts
It resembles one of the many small run mediterranean spots in the village transplanted way uptown and I usually make it a point to come here on my way to Carnegie Hall or Central Park on the weekends they do have an excellent brunch as well
Visiting new york after a while saw this new restaurant and tried it one night to my surprise I was thoroughly impressed with the operation and the tasty bistro fare menu
I had calamari for appetizer which was fried to a golden crisp not overdone , and a veal for main course with a side of pumpkin ravioli which was absolutely to die for
i was very happy with the ambience not too loud not too crowded inside
I noticed a reviewer describing scala as a tourist trap well i certainly feel like it was much less a trap than any other restaurant in midtown , in fact the only reason i went in was because the prices looked so economical compared to nearby rue 57 and ocean club
definitely will return once back in the city
Ive been coming to scala even before it was changed into a restaurant and have noticed how its only improved
whoever commented on it being a fake bistro is obviously blind to the fact that it arguably serves the best authentic pizzas and pastas in a ten block radius of central park south
I will keep coming not only for the food but the reasonable prices and growing but reasonable wine selection,
tell me where else you can get fresh pennes for under fifteen in central park south without an attitude
enough said
A memorable evening for my 38th birthday
Perfection can't describe enough, this charming douplex situated by Central Park and Carnegie Hall
The menu primarily Northern Italian with only fresh pastas exotic Meditteranean entrees, fine ingredients, homemade desserts, was done with style and simplicity
The service outstanding
Wines from all over the world
I couldn't have asked for more
By the way there is a private room for parties
I have worked around the corner from scala for the past 4 years and used to enjoy scala when it was a typical ny delhi
Slowly they have re-done the place and have turned it into a fake bistro
I say fake because they have added a cheesy wine display infront of the store and candles to the tables, yet the food is still the same
Watch out tourists!
Quite the disappointment!! You barely saw the filet mignon on your plate
Blink ull miss it! The veal smelled like a farm! The only worthy meal was the kalamata salad but even the feta in that was horrible! Don't recommmend unless you have no where else to go
I am a hotel concierge in the area and highly recommend this restaurant to all of my guests who are looking for a great place to eat, be it breakfast, lunch, or dinner
The staff is very kind and the ambiance is up to par with the upscale area where Scala Cafe is located
Five STARS!!
This place blew me away !,
from the prices i expected average italian fare, i had the pesto gnocchi for appetizer and the homemade moussaka for dinner
my wife had the linguini pescatore which was absolutely spectacular
never had pasta this good except when i was in italy last summer

the interior isnt stuffy and the music was great
the staff made us really feel at home so we kept drinking bottles of merlot well after our meal
Definite top five italian in the area
Another hell's kitchen gem
Authentic peruvian food, friendly family-run place and fantastic prices
Lunch special for $7
50 - dinner only around $15
i will keep it short, the guy answering the phone was rude, asked for a pizza with specific toppings given a price of $10, pizza guy finally arrived after 35 mins when i was told 10mins, gave a price of $21
50 why? apparently a topping costs $2
50 we had 4 topping which equals $10 then another $1
50 was added becuase it was delivered to our door pizza was terrible thin crusty oily running of grease i would stay well away, if you want pizza goto dominos charge a lot less and is much better!!!
This was the worst experiance I had in NY, ordered a small pizza with 4 toppings and had it delieved
Was told on the phone that it was going to be 10$ when the delivery boy came it turned out to be 22$ because they charge $2
50 for every extra topiing besides cheese
imaginitive toppings or just your good basic New York City Pizza
We ate at Ray's as much as possible
There are several places that say Ray's Pizza and they are all the greatest
My husband got a calzone and said that if he had been standing up when eating it, his legs would have caved
It's that good
Any pizza you get is great too
We were watching an old rerun of S
(citysearch won't accept this word) and the City the other night and they were at this Ray's eating and Steve says it's the best in the city
Without a doubt!
I asked a couple of locals where to grap a slice, and they all said go to Ray's They were right I stopped by Ray's for a slice multiple times while in town for work
I love this place, good pie! Very good pizza, rival to Joes and Johns
I've ordered from Ray's Pizza on 856 8th Ave
so many times! They're ALWAYS fast their food is soooo delicious! I even go there just to sit in the place! It's amazing to see how many people come from all over, to this 1 pizzeria

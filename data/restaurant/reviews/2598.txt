My other disappointment was that the desert some of the reviewers praised here (hot chocolate with ice cream) is only available on weekends
My date and I went before the show
And we are locals just as a quick disclaimer, I know this area is a touristy place
But we had a blast! There was a crooner and then a duet piano/singer and trumpet player looking right out of the Roaring 20's or some Paris Montramarte avant garde time
The food was great! Best was the chocolate Bread Pudding with a warm chocolate sauce - oh man an orgasm of taste! We are social so the people so close to us was no problem, we just conversed with them part of the night
And the service! They take your show time down and make sure you get out of there in time even if it means putting you over somebody else
It was great!
We arrived at Chez Josephine after a visit to Broadway, and were not disappointed with the service nor the food! I understand that pre theatre can be a little hectic but as we arrived mush later we were seated promptly and had excellent service
Would recommend to friends most certainly
It's a very romantic restaurant but make sure you go on an empty stomach as the portions are large and rich!
Fabulous does not do this restaurant justice but it is all I can think of
The only draw backs were that we were seated right next to the piano players and at times it was a little loud, and the lighting made it so that you had to use your candle to read the menu
The food was absolutly fantastic and the portions were more than I expected
(considering this is a French Restaurant)  Jean Claude (the owner) took time out to sit with us and chat it up for a few which was a nice finish to an already wonderful evening
My next trip will have to include a visit to this Restaurant
25th Wedding Aniversary for my parents, and they treated us poorly, and then debated with us when THEY screwed up the order
Overall I was shocked that such a traditionally classy establishment would treat people this way on such a special night
I had never been before, and will never go again
If you're looking for upscale French cuisine I would suggest Le Cirque (of course), or better yet Daniel
The atmosphere and service are great
very cozy
But don't go during the pre-theatre rush -- it's a mob scene up until 8:00pm
We had a 7:30 res but had to wait 45 minutes to be seated
The food is very good though and the prices reasonable
The piano player and trumpet player are nice, but a bit loud for the small, cramped space
If you're sitting too close to the piano, you won't be able to hear anything else
The friendly face of Ramon as he greeted us at the door along with the great service from Cesar , excellent food, romantic setting, and light piano music made this a definite worthwhile trip out into the cold on a Tuesday night
Although, a limited menu, we had no trouble picking out our delicious meal
The lamb shank special was a delight and the pumpkin bisque made me melt
Exceptional service, great atmosphere, and a great feeling of welcoming
We will definitely return
I cannot say enough good things about this place
I went here for my birthday and I have never had such a good experience at a restaurant
The service was like none other, the owner personally seated us and spent a few minutes talking with us
He also showed us to the door when we were ready to leave ( which is hard to do because you will want to linger forever)
The live piano was lovely and relaxing
The decor and food are fabulous
The price is right too
It is a sheer delight!!!!
Excellent, we went along after a visit to the theatre and we loved it! The food was excellent and the staff polite and helpful! Although the food was quick we were not rushed and made very welcome by all the staff
We visited after the theatre, so it was a little quieter than we thought, which was lovely and we enjoyed the benefits of the unhasseled staff! a def must visit!
Live nearby
Love the fabulous owner, who greets and seats
It's always an excellent flabouyant and classy place to take friends and newcomers to the city and to return to
truly unique
The food doesn't change much, and I can't seem to shake the need for some more outrageous and even more flavorful dishes
My sister and I took my mother here after a show for her birthday
All I can say is Wow! They took us early, seated us quickly
Food was phenominal, service quick but not rushed
Everyone was cheerful
Just a great evening out!
If you like low lit restaurants and wonderful food thats hot, this is a great choice
With the peaceful sound of a live pianist and a variety of appetizers, entrees, desserts, and of course, many expensive wines, you will think your in Paris, France
I enjoyed this little restaurant and would go back again
There is a bar and a dining area
Just try this if you are an adventurous person who doesn't mind trying something different for a change
Please let me know what you think
I just ate lunch there after hearing it was a good spot for the theatre crowd
First off, I wasn't greeted properly and they were just staring at me when I walked in
The BBQ Wings weren't cooked well
and tasted bland
The Chicken Caesar Salad hardly tasted like caesar dressing, the chicken was burnt and it was not enjoyable
The bread was probably the best part of my meal, but it too was tough
The only positive I had was that the butter wasn't frozen when served
I happened upon this restaurant because the sign for their Pre Fix menu caught my eye
The salad was the only redeeming part of the meal
The salmon was a very skimpy serving, was a bit soggy on the bottom, the rice was dry, the vegetables hard and not flavorful, and for dessert the apple pie tasted like cafeteria food
Worst of all, my boyfriend ordered the chicken fettucini alfredo and he said the chicken was dry and it was the worst chicken fetucini alfredo he had ever had
The frozen meal I am eating for lunch today at work is better than what they served us
We will not be going back!
Not cheap, by any means, but the Pirx Fixe meal was a decent deal
Good service
But $6
00 for a bud light? Geeze
We went before a show because everywhere else we tried to get into was full
We both had the set menu which offered salad, a choice of salmon, chicken or ravioli and desert
The salad was drenched in dressing but the grilled chicken was quite good
The best of all was the cheescake
Awesome
The service was rushed but still pleasant
The prix fix was about $20
We had a good meal with plenty of time to get to the theater
We overheard another couple talking about the good food here while we were walking around looking for a restaurant after our show
Atmosphere is very nice
Service is excellent
Food is okay
Some things on the menu are expensive
The Pre-Fixe selections were reasonable
Food did come out very quickly
We were only in the restaurant under an hour
There are so many servers and workers there though (really alot of them are just standing around wondering what to do) that I guess that is why we got everything so quickly
Overall, reasonable food for price for Pre-fixe dinner (got salad, entree and dessert for 20 dollars a person)
Excellent service, very friendly!
If you want to taste the most revolting food at laughably high prices check out Lindy's, where you will also find incompetent service with an attitude
This is no exaggeration
We just visited NYC and thought we'd try Lindy's
We saw people walking out complaining that they had sat too long at their tables without service
The prices were slightly higher than Carnegie and the portions were half the size
My daughter ordered lox and bagels and it was terrible
The lox were not trimmed and were mostly brown

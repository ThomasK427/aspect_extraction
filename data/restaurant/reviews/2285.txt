I looked up a few times and his eyes didn't leave our table
I dunno what he thought I was going to do with the food, but that kind of weirded me out and made me decide not to eat there again
But it's great if you're a tourist I guess, so you can see Rockefellar Center
The mashed potatoes were powdered
Are you kidding? With a $35 entree and no vegatables it should at least come with real potatoes
When I complained to the snooty waiter he just gave me a blank stare like what do you expect? For a $170 bill for me, my wife and 2 kids
I expect more
The portions were tiny
Atmosphere was great
Will not return though
Excellent service,good food,tremendous portions,great views,economical wine list (and savvy),well managed,ice skating,and a three star chef! Unfortunately due to its' location it gets labelled, but it is worth the venture outside of your neighborhood
Anyone know of San Domenico, that NY Times three star restaurant on CPW? Well the chef that got them those three stars is running the show now and his name is Theo Schoenegger- ooh those lucky tourists!
I recently stopped for a Sunday Brunch and had a great time
The staff was very friendly and polite
I had terrific Blueberry pancakes and my friend's  pasta was really good
The views are great and it made for a pleasant sunday afternoon
As a manhattan resident, I stayed away- it was a mistake
The service was quite accomodating and well paced
It was busy(very), but the Filet Mignon was comparable in size and flavor to major steakhouses
My wife's crab cakes were quite possibly the best ever tasted
The maitre'd gave us complimentary desserts which were delish! Ask to see the 30 wines (bottles) under $30
It is a great value, and watching the ice skaters fall was a riot
I took some friends here the other night and had a great time
We had good drinks at the bar(Martini's) along with some free finger foods
our meals as terrific, especially the Crab Ckaes, Mushroom Pasta and Prime rib
Friendly service made it an enjoyable time, with great views of the iceand Rock Center
An undiscovered treat in an otherwise over trendy city
I found the wait and bar staff to be very friendly and knowledgeable
The food is consistently good
Location, location, location! You can eat AND be entertained by all the fools falling down on the ice outside
The food isn't anything to write home about but the ambience is great
Its a good place to bring out-of-towners who are visiting or even to bring a client out to impress him
The best thing (and the worst thing) about Rock Center Cafe is the location -- right in Rock Center by the ice skating rink, which is great in both the summer and wintertime
Unfortunately, the location tends to draw lots of tourists
The food was decent, and the service is good (if predictable)
In fact, I think they cloned the guys over at the Sea Grill (across the rink) to fill the ranks here
Yes, the foodis overpriced
All in all, a decent place for some sit down food if you're eating in the Promenade
Enjoy!
and yes its pricey but its Rockefeller Center and Mid-Town NYC - you'd do better a Le Bernardin or 21 Club? My wife and I took our son there on Saturday the 2nd of November prior to packing him off to Japan for the Air Force
The Salmon filet (in sweet potato sauce?) was delicious
Go and enjoy
Bob in Toms River NJ
I went w/ my friends on Sept
11th and there was not many people there
The food was great, especially the crab cakes
Big portions of ribs and chicken
We sat indoors but the ambience was great w/ the flags waving and the golden statue of Rockefellar
Good for party of six or less
Service was a bit slow, but I guess they wanted you to sit and enjoy the view
I recently came in for a cocktail outside with some co-workers, and I just wanted to let you know that we enjoyed ourselves very much
Staff was very accommodating to our ever need
Thanks for helping to make our rough day at work alittle more enjoyable!!!! SEE YOU SOON
I ate at Rock Center Cafe about a month ago and I was very pleased with the food and the staff
There was a young manager that was very attentive to mine and other customer's needs
It was a beautiful day outside, but we decided to sit by a window inside
The only thing that I was unhappy with, is the tables
When I was there a few years back there were nice table cloths
I felt as though, Rock Center Cafe was taking the cheaper way out
But thanks again
A wonderful Sunday lunch spent
My mother and I really enjoy our stay
Okay, went there last night, and always wanted to go
It's a nice place, but the food is really pricey
Food was alright, the soup of the day was good (broccoli cheese) and I had the Chicken Breast Milanese, which was so not worth $15
My friend had the salmon and mashed potatoes, she liked it but like I said, for the money you pay for the meal, I think you're better off somewhere else where the food is just as good
I think our meal came out to $80 but we had the $30 dine out coupon
Still, I wouldn't go back unless I had a coupon, maybe that's why they give them out
Other than for the ambience of being in Rockefeller Center, it's not all that special
The only plus may be the indoor/outdoor bar
Its a crowded mid-town sushi restaurant but the sushi is good and really fresh
Its a bit pricey (two of us ate three rolls for around $45)
And you'll need to make reservations
my wofe and I were visiting NYC for the first time and Hurley's was recommended by the Bell captain at our hotel (the Renaissance)
We were absolutely delighted with the meal, the service was very good, just not quite excellant
The photos on the walls were great
The food was the best part; LongIsland Roast Duck-superb!!! Paired with a wonderful cup of coffe, the New York Cheesecake-a perfect ending
I took my son to the premiere of Harry Potter on Sunday
The pre-party was at Tuscan Square
This restaurant transformed into the Hogwarts School from Harry Potter
The food was delicious although named grossly after food from the movie ie: dragon snot (which mush son could not get enough of)
The staff was a pleasure especially dealing with a large group of children
The details they put into this party made the whole afternoon a wonderful outing for my child
I would definately come back here with my husband or friends or my children
It is a wonderful restaurant
Very bad time at Tuscan Square: 1
Restaurant lost our reservations 2
Kitchen did not offer same dishes listed on the internet 3
Kitchen did not even offer special that we were told about 10 minutes prior 4
We were told that we should order soon because the kitchen was closing, it was 8:30pm!!!
We love going to tuscan Square for dinner regularly
The food is to die for! You can tell that everything is very fresh and homemade
The restaurant is beautiful, right down to the plates! I especially love the front room, with the ceiling painted like the sky and the huge chandelier
Service is very professional
Also try visiting the downstairs markertplace during the weekdays for lunch
They have the same type of food, fresh and made daily, only cheaper and you can get it to go
The most beautiful restaurant in New York! Elegant, delicious and the best wine list that we've come across
We had 8 people there for a business meeting and everone was impressed
We'll definately be back
Had dinner in this lovely restaurant

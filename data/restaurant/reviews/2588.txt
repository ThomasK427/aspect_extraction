When the soup came, the bus boy placing the soup dish in front of us did not know who ordered the dish
We were helping him along the way
One of the bus boys, laughing, asked us to raise our hand if we ordered the soup
After the entre, we waited over forty minutes, even after we inquired twice
Two of us did not get our deserts after the rest finished theirs
We then got grievance from the manager after we complaint of the service
He did apologize after we were leaving, with our desert in the take-out containers
I would not go back there
I expected this kind of services from a diner
I've had dinner here a few times and have never been disappointed
The service is attentive, friendly and respectful
The food is wonderful, perfectly seasoned and beautifully presented
A great dining experience
We stopped in late one rainy night and were treated to one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant
The food was excellent, the wine was great, and the service was super! Its a bit expensive, but if you want great Tuscan food in a romantic atmosphere with attentive service, you can't go wrong here
I have never had such an awful experience
My food was prepared incorrectly I was scorned because the manager/waiter was unclear as to the instruction
Then, my substitute dish did not arrive EVER and the rest of my party was through eating
I cancelled my order and was scorned for that
We were then charged for the dish and told by the manager/waiter that he was old enough to be my father, an inappropriate comment that had nothing to do with how rude and awful the customer service was
I asked for the owner's name and number and was refused by the manager/waiter, who claimed he would give him my information, which he did not have
I am a young attorney and have never been treated so rudely by a man who could barely communicate
I would never wish going to this restaurant on my worst enemy
Thursday night, 730pm, no reservation, no problem
Sat immediately, friendly staff
Busboy saw our table was shakey, fixed immediately w/out us saying a word
The black angus steak was served sizzling wheeled out on a hotplate on a separate card and my g/f had the special filet mignon
Both amazing
Fried calamari was the best I ever had for an appetizer
House wine to compliment
the only bad thing
price
after generous tip, plan on spending in the low 100s for 2 entree's, 1 appy, and 3 glasses of wine
I love coming here cus the sandwiches are so yummy
It's a great place to come for lunch or get food on the go
I love the Grilled Chicken t
b
m
But when it gets crowded there isn't always seats
All in all its a good place to chill
Cosi is such a great place to eat if you only have $20
The sandwiches are the best I have ever had and the bread they put them makes them even better, and they give your serving of food the sandwiches are huge
My friend and i went out to eat and we split one of the sandwiches
It definety is a place to go to if you live or are visiting the city
And even if you see a line and its crowded inside don't worry the line moves so fast you'll be in and out before you know it
And if your going to go see a broadway show they cater to you so your not late they will tell you how long you'll have to wait for your food and whats the fastest
The bread is awesome, I must agree! For a quick meal on the go or a quick stop, this place beats any fast food joint
The service was fast, correct and easy
The meal was a great lunch that didn't weigh me down
Enjoyed having something other than the basic sandwich shop
Cosi came thru!
Go for the bread, it's always warm and tasty
It isn't too filling either
The line moves fast and there is a wide selection of sandwiches
Although you can end up spending about $12 on lunch
My only complaint was that we were given a check that was not itemized and
well  you judge for yourself; one appetizer, two entrees and two glasses of wine;  bill was $150
89
The entrees were listed as $14
95 and $13
95
The appetizer was  $4
95
Stay Away
Note: we had food delivered
We ordered from here this evening
The food was OK
Not bad - not good
What was odd was that the guy who delivered the food refused to give me the receipt(?!?)
So, I called once I got upstairs to my office and offered to let them fax it over
No, I was told someone would have to bring it by
75 minutes later the recipt still has not arrived so I call again
Ironically they can now not locate a major French bank when 2 hours previously they had no problem
With all the restaurants around here selling this same food Via Italia simply is not worth the effort
Want a great little Italian restaurant? Try Circo on 55th - you won't spend much more money and there is simply no comparison to this place
Very nice, homy comfortable atomosphere
Food portion is small, good presentation and very delicious!  We will definately go again to sit on the counter to get chief's omakase;-)
if you want to try real Japanese Sushi
Don't go to those restaurants in Top 10 list, because they are so phony that no Japanese person can dare to dine
but with Mr
Moto, everything is for real
I recommend to sit at the sushi bar and ask for Omakase (up to Chef) for the maximum enjoyment
It used to be one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city
But lately, the quality of its food has deteriorated dramatically
The portion is getting smaller and the sashimi is getting thinner
I 'm very disappointed and will never dine in moto anymore
Can't find fresher fish than at Moto! Mr
Moto is an artist who cares about perfection
This is our regular Friday nite dinner spot
I am usually wary about sushi places, but Mr
Moto serves fresh, clean fish in a friendly and personal manner
Good sushi for a great price in a cozy and really nice atmosphere
Add great cheerful service, and you've got a great find in midtown!
Tiny but superlative great food that is underpriced for the value and even better service
The staff is very knowledgeable and easygoing, food is made to order and the pastas are always fresh
Overall a real gem in the theater district
Very reliable italian eatery in the theater district
This cozy little place is no red sauce joint, and the staff is always friendly and attentive
Good place for dinner before or after a show, or on a date
The Scene Toss a roll across Orso's bustling dining room and chances are it will bounce off the noggin of someone in show business

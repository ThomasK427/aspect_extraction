As close to perfection as any I've seen
Great staff
This spot never fails to impress
Our most recent visit was for a spectacular pre-theatre brunch
The ambiance, food and service were all top drawer
A+
Good to great food, friendly staff
But, go to hear the jazz
Gene is a classis jazz guitarist, usually there on Sunday and Monday nights
Always an increadable place to stop by for a romantic meal, a pre-show bite, or that all important quiet late drink with someone special
The garden room adds a special touch of feeling completely removed from the city
Most importantly, for a french restaurant, there seems to be a suprising lack of snooty french accents
went to Le Madeleine on a friend's reccomendation and loved the place
Beautiful garden, surprisingly very good food, and super nice staff
We loved the seared salmon salad
we'll be back
We've been coming here for years, and the place just keeps getting better
The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, even when they're packed, which is most of the time
The food is modern without being fussy, and is ALWAYS delicious
Our favorite in the area
This is one great restaurant
Moderately priced, great food , great ambiance ( try to get a table in the garden!)
Probably the best skate in NY
Innovative twists on bistro classics, always very good
Every dish our waiter reccommended was right on the money, and we get out on time for our show!!
Been there two or three times, always a great meal, great service, just a charming, cozy, delightful, unpretentious place
Eating at Broadway Joe's was the first time that I ordered a meal at a restaurant and couldn't eat it because it was disgusting
The steak was one large piece of fat and it came with vegetables with no taste
Plus, they charged restaurant row prices
I received a 20% coupon with a pair of theater tickets
That was the good part
The restaraunt looked like a holdover from the gangster 30's
To get to the rear dining room required a walk through part of the kitchen
My wife's scallops had such an off flavor she thought they may be spoiled
My prime sirloin steak was ordered medium and showed bloody tasteless
A shrimp dish, 5 shrimp was subbed for the scallops with the upgrade in price included
Our waiter disappeared and I had to ask for the check
A real rip-off
I went to Joes Steakhouse this past weekend, hoping to enjoy a great meal with my boyfriend
All I can say is that the food with a disappointment
The steak was disgusting, I felt like I was eating in a dingy hole in the wall
I would not recommend this place to anyone
If youll looking for good food stay away from this place!
Thankfully we had a 20% discount coupon to soften the blow of this high-priced/ low-value restaurant
Portions were small, prices high, totally a la carte
Shrimp Scampi had 4 medium skinny shrimp over a cup of buttered spaghetti
Wait staff was surly
Room was reminisent of a rented hall at an Elks club or similar; we were tightly squeezed into a narrow room
Seven of us sought this place out after doing some web-surfing -- learned not to judge a book by its cover
After having great fun at a matinee and doing a little shopping, this experience put a damper on an otherwise fabulous day in the city
DON'T GO
Hey, maybe this Web site is doing some good on the retail end
Our group of 7 ate there in late Oct
, and was seated promptly in a dining room, even
The service was very good, the food was better than average (though not quite worth the $$$$)
Lots of Hirschfield (sp?) caricatures and diners don't seem to mind folks leaning over their tables to take a closer look

( At least, no one stabbed me
) Would I go back? Maybe
But I wouldn't neccessarily say away, either
It's OK
Oh, by the way
my NY strip sirloin was a good cut and cooked perfectly
Really tasty
The Scene Barbetta is a graceful and commodious dining space, with twinkling chandeliers, pale rose walls, a soaring ceiling and generously spaced tables
A magnificent outdoor dining garden is open in clement weather
Although it may seem like a formal Old World place, it has a young attitude: You can get decked out and go there for a romantic special occasion, or just drop in casually attired for a bowl of pasta
The Food The restaurant specializes in the cooking of Italy's Piedmont region, with special historic dishes going back to the restaurant's early 20th-century opening
Nice light starters include the grilled sweet peppers with anchovy sauce and stuffed zucchini
Thick, restorative minestrone is another good bet
A house favorite, pollo al babj, is a pounded, peppered and deliciously seared split chicken
Service at Barbetta is vigilant and caring, but if you need to catch a show, make it known when you sit down
My date and I had the best night here
The food was outstanding (and largely organic/free-range, which was a pleasant surprise)
We sat outside in the garden and enjoyed the weather fountain
The serving staff actually forgot to bring our appetizers, but the waiter was charmingly distressed and made everything right
I could tell from other guests dining inside that this also makes a good family destination, but definitely leans towards romantic and couples
I would highly recommend Barbetta to anyone looking for a perfect, lovely evening
Food and service to die for
We recently gave a party in Barbetta's private rooms
The reception and dinner were perfectly organized, the food was delicious and the service friendly and flawless
We visited other places but the deciding factor in selecting Barbetta was the incredible ambiance of its private rooms
These are the original rooms of Barbetta's townhouses dating from 1874 and it's amazing that they preserve all of their original wood paneling, fireplaces and period furnishings (we discovered that the owner is an art historian)
It's a truly patrician setting - not like entertaining in a public place, but in the grand home we all wished we had
Very highly recommended!
Barbetta has to be the most beautiful restaurant in New York! It's like  being in a European palazzo
The elegant yet tasty food matches the  surroundings, as does the stylish service
A must visit
If you are a desert lover like me, head to Barbetta
I had heard about their dessert waggons featuring 16 different desserts nightly ! late one night together with other foodies we dropped in just for desserts
There cannot be sweeter way to end an evening
One of the most romantic exeperiences of my life
My boyfriend took me here on my one year aniversary and he could not pick a better restaurant
Food was amazing, decor was absolutely stunning, and service was outstanding
I go out to eat quite a lot and this is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city period! Thanks Barbetta for a night to remember
The Scene This eponymous celebration of model-TV-host-former-magazine-publisher-restaurateur Barbara Smith is the snazziest spot along the Theater District's Restaurant Row
Aside from the food, it's a great place to meet for a drink before or after a show
The theatrical decor combines mustard-yellow walls with burgundy accents, geometrical mirrors, faux arches and, unsurprisingly, a colossal painting of guess who
The Food The menu features well-executed pan-Asian dishes like salmon speckled with sesame seeds and paired with vegetable-stuffed nori rolls; excellent curried deep-fried oysters with coconut-wasabi dip; and brittle little Saigon shrimp rolls
Several down-home Southern dishes remain, but while the smothered pork chops with smoked trotter tidbits are fork-licking-good, the pork ribs are tough and tasteless

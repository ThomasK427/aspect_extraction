DO NOT MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM THE BEST!
The food rules the day at this little hole in the wall
Don't expect anything but good eats
Sweet people run the place too
They close a bit too early for the city though
In Short Hungry customers order at the counter of this comfort-food staple, grabbing their food to go or digging in at padded booths in the dining room, which is painted in warm shades of yellow, green and blue
Best known for its signature sweet garlic rotisserie chicken, the restaurant also whips up rotisserie turkey and Angus meat loaf, plus chicken potpie, Asian or Southwest grilled chicken salads, and sides of mac and cheese, creamed spinach, sweet corn and more
Its like going into disney land - everyone who works here is so unbelievably friendly that you feel like you're in the midwest somewhere
The meatloaf, and turkey are bursting with flavor as are the corn and mac and cheese
I am not a fast food person, so I do not give this place a good rating
Also, I totally agree wtih the person who wrote the review before me
The people who work at this location are horrible
They are mean, and they do not want to be even remotely helpful to their customers
I do not recommed going here
The only thing I like to get at Boston Market are the Turkey Carver sandwiches
These sandwiches are pretty good, but otherwise I go to real restaurants
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried starbucks coffee before it became well-known and had thought great
Too bad I didn' think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabolous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and servive does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never dissapoint you

good burgers, crispy fries, great shakes, tasty prices, when you are always looking for a diner and never know where to go this is one to check out
In Short Everyone knows Krispy Kreme takes donut-making seriously, even the Smithsonian which has archived company equipment
But customers gather in the starkly lit, white tiled shops or at food court outposts to await the HOT sign's illumination (which indicates a fresh batch), not a history lesson
Still-warm glazed originals have been the company's mainstay since 1937
Over a dozen other variations are offered--chocolate iced, traditional cake, and lemon-filled, among them-yet simplicity reigns supreme
-
After 2 years of hearing all the fuss over these doughnuts, we had to find this place to try one
Lady behind counter was friendly and recommended the original glazed doughnut
She gave us a fresh one from the oven
HEAVEN!! Tried another two more different ones but not warm - ok but can't beat the first one
Only worth buying a dozen if eaten within first hour from the fryer/oven
90 cents a piece is a bit steep though
I tried Bluberry grazed dougnut and pumpkin spicy dougnut both of which was extremely delicious! I asked the shop man for reccommendation and he was quite nice
Had a HORRIFIC experience with a rude cashier who flat out refused to correct my incorrectly assembled order (after I had repeated myself 2-3 times -- it still came out wrong) and then proceed to lean over the counter to grab my money out of my hand and shove incorrect change at me
Customers who witnessed my experience just left the store they were so shocked
The manager on duty was pretty nice (and fed up, you could tell) and she tried to correct things by giving me the correct change, a free dozen (which I didn't need -- I had just been forced to buy 2) and some free coffees
However, she should've fired the jerk behind the register on the spot or at least reprimanded her in public
The lady cashier just continued to treat customers after me with the same disrespect
I love Krispy Kreme, don't get me wrong
I love how at 23rd street I can sit down and enjoy my food for a bit, and they have what I want
Those flavored creamers for the coffee are awesome too! However, the staff seems to be lacking concentration or interest -- if I'm not getting my food slammed around in there, they're messing up the order and giving me the wrong donuts after repeating myself three times! (And I don't have a bad attitude, funny accent or a speech impediment either!)
they have the best friggin' glazed donuts I have ever eaten
hands down the best
these dounts are so good it's hard to describe in words
trust me on this one
Krispy Kreme is no longer a secret so this info isn't really groundbreaking
but do yourself a favor and try their donuts!!
In Short The first of many choices at this takeout spot is whether to join the soup or salad line
Tuscan white bean and three-lentil chili are on the daily soup menu, alongside rotating varieties such as broccoli cheddar and curried shrimp chowder
For salads tossed to order, customers select their greens and choose among add-ins including avocado, steamed asparagus, blue cheese and grilled chicken
Prewrapped sandwiches are displayed at checkout
The soups and salads at Hale Hearty are terrific
They are great options for a quick lunch in locations all over the city
My gripe is with the service
The check-out people do not know how to use the registers and are actively rude
I could grin and bear the expensive prices (about double what is cited in the profile above) if it weren't for the excrutiating experience of buying from this chain
If you don't liek soup- you have never been to Hale amp; Hearty
One of my favorite lunch spots around time
Since I travle all around the city- there's always one close by
I especially like the one in Chelsea Market
They offer at least 10 soups a day- I usually go for the specials
Last week I had the cold Shrimp amp; Asparagas
it was a great lunch
The staff is very friendly and they give free samples (if you can't amke a decision, like me)
I'd starve without this place
Salads made to order and a selection of savory soups, plus some of the most pleasant service you'll find in this city
Haute cuisine it ain't, but for a great weekday lunch, it can't be beat
Hidden in Chelsea Market, I do not think this store gets as much credit as it should
They have some of the softest bagel in NYC
They also have many different flavors of bagels including lo-carb for the atkins friendly
They also offer a huge variety of cream cheeses which are always fresh
I strongly reccommend everyone take a trip to the west side to enjoy the best bagels in New York!
I order from this place often since it is only one block from my work
They are usually slow (30-45 min) but I deal with it because their bagels are decent
Well, after today I am NEVER ordering from them again
They came 1 hour and 15 minutes after I placed the order and forgot 1/2 of what I ordered! They are only 1 block away, this is unacceptable
I f you aren't that hungry and can wait until lunch time for your breakfast then they are the bagel shop for you!
Needing a sugar fix, my husband and I walked in here to find a wall to wall adornment of delightful confections

The vibe is pretty frat-boy (not unlike the source city), and I wouldn't call it cheap here
The Shrimp Remoulade is particularly yummy
The bar area can get quite fiesty--it might even be more of a bar scene than a food one, despite the quality of the latter
A last minute dinner plan with a co-worker had us ending up at Pomaire by simply walking down 46th Street
I should have recognized that this place was a gem by the kind gentleman outside in front and his inviting demeanor to dine at Pomaire
Once we walked in, the decor and atmosphere made you feel as if you had traveled far away from the chaos of Times Square just a few blocks away
The food, menu and the native salsa was just lovely and the outstanding service made this a truly a wonderful dining experience
Definitely a keeper and next time I'm leaving the car and taking the train so I can try the tempting native Chilean cocktails!
excellent service,great atmosfer,a large wine list,and the MOJITO was incredible,all the people was very friendly,and the bathroom was very clean,and the bar is very home style,i had the chilean see bas was fantastic,and the dessert also(mil hojas and merenge lucume)and the camomilla licor was amazing,they give you time for order,but the service was good and fast,i loved
Excellent choice, for pre-theater or whenever
Menu concentrates on seafood and the kitchen delivers every time
Chilean food is mild (nothing to do with chiles) but full of natural flavors
Portions are Euro-sized, which makes for guiltless dining
The wine list is impressive
Check out the wine of the week and/or follow the advice of the owner/manager
He's passionate about the wines of his country, will gladly allow tastings and seldom pours a bad drop
The intimate atmosphere, restrained decor and quietly efficient staff are added pros
Well done, Pomaire!
I went to pomaire with a friend to get some insight into a upcoming trip to chile that my friend was leaving for
Was I ever happy I decided to go! This place should be a model for other establishments in NYC!!! The staff was friendly,and attentive but not breathing down your back at the same time
The owner was happy to explain to us the menu and recommend dishes for us to try
I had a fish entree that was superb, my friend enjoyed a wonderful steak
The owner was delighted to hear about the trip to chile and exchanged email info with my friend
Turns out that he was going to be in Chile with his family at the same time and offered to be a reference in Santiago
This place is now in my regular rotation of top spots in NYC
PS
the chamomille liquer was excellent
We were super excited to try Pomaire on a rainy afternoon in the city, now I wish we would've just stayed in
When we got there, we were ignored by the female hostess who was too busy talking on the phone (she remained on the phone for the next hour!)
Not only did we have to wait about 20 minutes for the waiter to take our orders, we watched the woman at the other table get up to ask for the check and personally take it up to the babbling hostess; she looked thoroughly irritated
When we finally got our food, it was just OK
I had the seafood gratin which, after watching Dr
90210 before coming to the restaurant, was a bad idea (think lipo and lard)
My boyfriend had the chicken which was bland and dry
Because of the bad service and mediocre food
we'll never go back again
At Pomaire, you can get authentic Chilean food such as baked empanadas, Chilean salad (tomatoes onions), lucuma merengue, suspiro del poeta (with papayas instead of peaches), and many others
Of course, there is always pisco sour
Yum
Overall, great place to get tasty Chilean food
Many of the main courses are a bit more flavorful than you'd usually find in Chile
(Spices on Chilean food? Since when?) But it is all tasty, and the servers and owner are very friendly
If you mention interest in Chile, the owner will happily fill you in (at *great* length), as will all Chileans! Be warned! :)
The owner is charming - when he found that my dinner companion had been to Chile, he lavished us with attention
They will offer a pre-theater prix fixe meal, but only reluctantly
We instead ordered entrees only and they were huge portions; congria (one of the fresh fish of the day) and the Chilean meat pie
Both wonderfully prepared with unusual flavors
There was also a unique salsa on the table, as well as really good rolls served with the dinner
We had such a good time that we returned two nights later just for dessert (Lucuma meringue cake - - very light and unique) and an after-dinner drink
I wish I could visit NYC more often just to eat here !
Unique ,exceptional cuisine ,atmosphere like and old fashion tabern with ambiance ,excellent option in the theather district , they served traditional drinks, pisco souer a drink made from a Chilean brandy and lemon juice,scallops served with cheese and the fish taste fresh as in the Pacific
Awesome place
Good food, excellent service
Try out the Pisci sour, the Chilean national drink
Corn Tamale is amazing
We ordered a second round of it
Will defintely visit again
Street parking
Great food, fantastic service and amazing wines (this Casa Lapostolle Syrah Cuvee Alexander was exceptional)
I will definitely come back
If only every restaurant were like this: simple, elegant, warm
The staff couldn't have been better
They were charming, knowlegable and made excellent suggestions without being pushy
The food was remarkable for its simplistic perfection
The seafood au gratin was to die for: a souffle-light dream of a dish
I cannot recommend Pomaire too highly
While the seating is a bit cramped the atmosphere and friendly, prompt service made up for it
We had a pleasant leisurely dinner but certainly could have made the time pass more quickly if we so desired
The appetizer and salad we chose were good - not great
BUT the 2 main course fish dishes were exceptional - nicely presented, generously portioned, and delicious
We went with recommendations of the staff and they did not steer us wrong
If we lived in the neighborhood (we don't) this would be a regular on our eating out schedule
This is such a great restaurant
It is very cozy and the food is delicious and very authentic
Everything is fresh and tastes home cooked
The Chilean wine list is also very good
The owner, who has greeted us at the door every time, is extremely warm and gracious and seems to take enourmous pride in what he does
He took the time to explain each dish to us and gave us some great recommendations
Definetely try the Empanada al Horno (meat turnover/pie), Humitas (fresh corn tamale), the salads, and Pastel de Choclo
For something more familiar to the palate, the roasted chicken with potatoes is amazing
Chilean food is not fancy (ie: no bordelaise sauces or creme brulee) but it is very hearty and delicious
It is definetely worth a try
This restaurant is a great Chilean Restaurant
I'm chilean and this is the only chilean restaurant in New York City that I know about
The food is excellent and the service is great! It is small but cozy and romantic
The drinks are also great
I recommend trying the Pisco Sour
The only downfall is that this restaurant can be a little pricey
If you want a taste of Chile, have money, and feel like getting a little ethnic, come on down
We found Pomaire to be an excellent place to eat
My fiancee's mother is from Chile and she was so excited because the food was just like her mother makes
I recommend trying an empanada as an appetizer, and the Sangria was very good also
I had dinner at Luxia last week
It was incredible from the moment we walked in
We had fruit infused martinis at the bar first
Definitely try the peach
We were seated in the gorgeous open air garden in the back of the restaurant
Very serene and not New York City
The food is organic and very fresh
My shrimp appetizer was great

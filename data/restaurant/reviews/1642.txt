They were relaxed enough that I'm sure it wouldn't have been a problem to stay as I was
Service was very attentive, but not pushy
The waiter really knew his job - he didn't miss anything and, once told, remembered my husband was deaf in one ear made sure he always spoke from the correct side
The food was excellent - good fresh ingredients, prepared well, and served stylishly
The room was nothing special - spacious, comfortable, not memorable
Would definitely come here again
After being almost FORCED into a dress code that this restaurant DOESN'T HAVE (except to look as old-school and stiff as possible), I sat down for what was one of the most UNINSPRIRING meals possible
In this, a city of multi-ethnic multi-everything, I haven't seen a menu this boring since staring blankly at the TV guide preview channel
The place was packed with tables of boring people trying to prove SOMEthing (what and to whom, I'm not sure), as was THE BAR, of all things
The only thing worth going there for is to remind yourself that people who voted for Guiliani still DO exist, and apparently, this is the place for them!
Why do I love Gotham Bar Grill? Because this restaurant is excellent EVERY time I go
They consistently serve top-notch food and the service is always fantastic
Last night was no exception; the tomato salad with arugula was the best appetizer I've had in awhile and my lobster was cooked to perfection
The chocolate carmel cake was amazing! I hope Gotham Bar Grill stays open for a long, long time because I will always go back
Wonderful food in a mundane setting, definitely geared towards an older crowd
My BF and I are in our 20s and I came dressed in black lace for a night out after dinner - we stood out like sore thumbs among the baby boomers escorting wives/mistresses to a swanky dinner
The setting was stuffy for a young couple looking for a romantic spot - the wine steward was amazed when we showed a basic knowledge of grapes, and the couple next to us were in their 80s (they informed us of this proudly) and on their 2nd date
But the food is wonderful
150 words is not enough to express our view on this restaurant
To sum it up, the service, food, staff and decor were incredible
The food was the best I have tasted in a long while
I would highly recommend all my friends to experience the Gotham Bar and Grill for themselves
We will return on our next trip to New York City
Thanks for a wonderful experience
I treated my boyfriend to dinner here
I loved the ambience and the service was great
The employees were very warm and pleasant and made us feel at home
The food was good, but seemed mismatched
Meaning, I ordered Lobster Tails as an entree (The Tails were delicious) and along with my Tails came Spinach with beans and fried potatoes that were close to potato steak fries
I can get steak fries at the average steakhouse
So, unfortunately I only can give the food an 8
Maybe the Tails would be better as a First Course
I went here for a graduation celebration--dressed up crowd, top-notch service and food
when I can afford it again, I'll be there
cool bar, too
maybe I'll stop in for a martini before I find another occasion to dine here
The decor is lovely, the service is warmattentive and the food is divine
I have never had so near perfect a restaurant experience and I have been to many of the city's best
My husband and I shared an appetizer and they split it for us without even us requesting it
Doing that showed real class! All the dishes were a feast for the eyes and palate
The serving staff was superb; our server was perfectly nice without being our buddy, always responsive and cordial without being snooty
The wine list had mostly expensive wines, but one does come here to treat oneself, right? We'll certainly be back!
I must confess - This as well as one other RAW Vegan places has me considering going vegetarian
But then again, if you live near a place like this or the other RAW place - it would be very easy to live a delicious vegan lifestyle
I was a bit overwhelmed by the menu - I thought being a vegan, macrobiotic restaurant I'd have limited choices here
NOT SO! This place's menu is like a menu at a diner - pages and pages long
Hard to make a decision
Only option: Come back more often
After all the food is fantastic!
In Short Set in a warehouse-sized room bathed in dark bluish light, Republic is one of the hottest restaurants in Union Square by virtue of its nouvelle take on affordable Asian cuisine
The noodle dishes (the best is a spicy chicken in a coconut milk-based broth) and the appetizers are a harmonious hodge-podge of Thai, Japanese, and other East Asian cuisines
Benches surround communal, lunch-hall tables, and the din in the high-ceilinged room can become deafening
I've been going to Republic for seven years now and I took my two year old son one day
Not only did they refuse to give me any milk but they charged me full price ($9) for plain udon noodles - no broth, veggies, or meat just wet noodles in a bowl
I couldn't believe how unbending and unhelpful they were
We also had to wait a very long time for the check, which anyone with children knows is a death knell for a successful eating out venture
Republic is a fast noodle joint, not a white table cloth estb
They have no reason to be so anti-child, especially since the general noise of the place is more than my two year old could produce on a cranky day
I will never go back again b/c they obviously don't care if I do
The food here is lousy, I'm sorry
The service is slow and otherwise unremarkable
The ambiance is that of an annoying dance club
Avoid
I love this place
I frequent al whole lot
Almost everyone I bring here loves it as well
Go you'll love it
I used to really like this restaurant, but last time we were there, about 1 month ago, I really was annoyed with it
I always really enjoyed the duck noodle bowl, but since I am now vegetarian, I was stuck with some bland vegetarian dish
I guess I just expected more flavor since some of their other dishes were pretty good
The person I was with had some kind of beef salad or something, and he was also disappointed - it was like a few leaves of lettuce with beef skewers, and he left basically as hungry as he was when we got there
Then the service was also poor the last time we were there
We didn't have to wait for a table, but we waited for awhile for someone to take our orders, and then after we ate, we had to wait seemingly forever to get our check
I was also in a bad mood because although there were plenty of open tables, they had to sit a big family with a few loud children right next to us rather than giving them their own table
For me, this really takes away from my dining experience
It's unfortunate, because, as I said, I used to like this place, but I probably won't be going back
Had easily the worst dining experience ever at Republic
Inexperienced waitstaff was unprepared to offer menu choices: I'm a vegetarian so I have no idea on any meat dishes
Beyond that: the group was suggested the Chicken Udon - which our group then requested without bean sprouts
Not only did the order still come WITH bean sprouts, but the arriving dish was akin to soggy fettucini doused in Listerine Cool Mint mouthwash
More appalling, the staff showed indifference and even laughed at our experience - not asking if the food was okay, not caring that the dish was not touched, not reacting other than with snickers when a note was left nor when a complaint was lodged on the meal receipt
This place needs to change its attitude, and its menu
The Republic offers great value with great size portions that are filling but not excessive
Given the moderate prices, I'd steer away from some of the meat items, as the price tag translates into cheaper quality cuts of meat
I ordered the grilled porkchops, and felt like I was chewing into leather
Another detraction as mentioned by another reviewer is the noise
This place isn't for the hard of hearing
So go to this place with a loud bunch of friends
The restaurant demographic skews young, so don't come hear, if you were born during or prior to the Nixon administration
Although the restaurant had a few misfires, the cool vibe, decent prices, and good portions outweigh the detractions
I think this place may be the worst restaurant I have ever been to in NY
I had the spicy beef noodle soup and my friend had the seafood noodles and both were simply inedible
The biggest surprise is that there are some decent reviews of Republic and the place actually had a 10 minute wait
No clue what these people are thinking
Honestly, this place is more about the ambience
The appetizers we had, one was shrimp, the other, salmon
tasted exactly the same
Sweet and sour
The chicken udon was just disgusting
The waitress warned us by saying that it has a unique taste

It's nice to go into a place and know what the food is
I hate going into places where either the food is too small or they are trying to be too creative and the main item of the dish is hidden
The bar is a great place to hang out with friends, the service at the bar is pretty fast
Every Thursday my friends and I meet up there for drinks and dinner
If you haven't been you got to go
while beautiful and trendy - dont waste your time here
food was good (nothing spectacular)
the service was the worst ive had in nyc in years
we were seated next to the most obnoxious table of suits who yelled everything
after asked if we wanted water, the waitress was from that point on MIA
manager had to take our first drink order (we were planning on a cocktail and then getting a bottle of wine with dinner) - no wine list was ever presented
our waitress finally made time to take our order - bread was never brought, water never refilled and wine never got to be ordered - had to ask for everything ourselves
she actually came by when dumping the dessert menu on us, glanced at our empty glasses and said 'ok so we're all good on drinks' and walked away before we could even answer
horrible
I'm a regular here and not ONCE have the bartenders, waitresses, and hostesses say a simple, THANK YOU
This is leaving them 25% tip because they don't bother me while I'm eating at the bar or the dining area
Don't sit at the bar area, unless you want your food to look orange, with bright orange lights towering overhead
One occasion I couldn't tell if my veal chops were a day old or fresh? It was on the tough side, not tender, chewy and covered in sauce, I just couldn't tell
I will stop going there because I'm never appreciated for dining there
The waitstaff seem to be preoccupied with the chefs that hang out throughout the night
I won't be back
Dinner at Thalia, though very good, is also nearly as pricey as some much better restaurants--instead, I think of Thalia as my brunch stand-by
On the weekends, $12-$18 buys you an entree, a drink (mimosa or screwdriver), and a bread/muffin tray, and the quality is just as good as in the evening
Excellent place to go for brunch
It's large and airy, not a good hangover place to go, more like a nice place to go if you want a leisurely, comfortable Sunday lunch with friends
I took a large group of clients to Thalia based on reviews I thought were positive
After 2 weeks with a reservation on hold, our party was still made to wait over an hour to be seated
Only then to be greeted by a server that was obviously bitter with the world
The foods mediocracy didn't make up for it either
I definitely do not recommend anyone going to this restaurant, it's New York City---there are far better places to dine and drink
Celebrated my birthday there
What a wonderful experience! Will return very soon
I came into Thalia on Thursday and I was so glad to see that the restaurants are doing very well, especially Thalia
I sat down at the bar and had the most interesting cocktail that I have ever had
The Pineapple Jewel it was amazing
We then decided to have some of the oysters since the bartendar told us about the chef
I'll tell you everything about this restaurant was absolutely amazing
If people are actually having a bad time I will find that Hard to imagine
I went to Thalia after a night out with my boyfriend
We were both in the mood for oysters and Thalia looked like it would be a great place
To the contrary, I found it to have very average service and food
The best thing was probably the ambience and the oysters, which they only had to open
Our waitress was unattentive and came around infrequentlyl Our food took a long time to make, although it was only pasta
They were also out of what I wanted that night
Overall, the food was so-so and simple but overpriced
My fiance and I came to this restaurant without a clue as to what it would be like
We couldn't have been more delighted! Very hip, delicious food, a wonderful waiter, great wine list and didn't put too much of a dent in our wallet
We would recommend this restaurant to anyone without kids
I planned a birthday party last night for 10 people
The reservation was easy enough to make the night before for a Saturday night (after the pre-theater crowd)
The appetizers were great
The entrees were a huge letdown
The service was quite poor
The waiter took forever to check on us
The ambiance was pretty nice
Overall, the experience was ok
We were annoyed by being charged 20% for such poor service
The food was rather dissapointing by all
This is a good place if you need a nice place, with mediocre food, and at the last minute!
Birthday weekend in NYC, found Thalia's on the web and thought we would take a chance
We could not have been more delighted with the wonderful food, exceptional service and lovely setting
It is not often I go to the trouble of taking the time to write reviews like this but I really feel Thalia's was something SPECIAL!! We'll definitely be back!
Last night I went to a benefit that started at Thalia's and continued with a show
I complained to the manager when at 7:30 most people had still not received their main course
She did not apologize, and the group still got charged for dessert although they never had time to serve it
This is unaccaptable at a restaurant that is supposed to cater to a pre-theater crowd!
It is hard to find good food where you find good theatre, but Thalia on 8th and 50th is the perfect combination
Thalia, what a great restaurant
Whenever we dined there, we had a great meal
We go to the theatre often for Matinee or evening shows and we always stop there for lunch/brunch or dinner
We are so happy we found you

Ate at Thalia recently with my fiance
At 8pm, checked our coats, and were quickly seated
Exquisite shrimp tagliatelle, and roasted free-range chicken
Pleasant chocolate torte
Good vodka martini, and lovely 2001 ice wine by the glass with dessert, all for $63
Great date restaurant
The patrons were young professionals, the decor warm
It was slightly loud because the bar area is very close to the dining area, so I'd recommend sitting further away or behind the wall
Can't believe that Thalia didn't make the top 5 of Citysearch's best brunch spots
The out-of-this world banana/raspberry (or request your favorite fruit) pancakes, the fantastic french toast that melts in your mouth, and the divine asparagus frittata are among the best items on the tantalizing $11
95 brunch menu
Stopped into Thalia on New Years Eve for a drink
We were seated very quickly on the big cushy leather couches
Alex, our cocktail waitress, was with us immediately and had our drinks to us almost as fast
Prices were far more reasonable than I thought they'd be at this type of place in midtown
Ordered some ala carte oysters and the wild mushroom polenta fricasee and both were fantastic, ESPECIALLY the polenta (the stock used in the reduction was fantastic) the bathrooms are sufficient cute and orchids are in bloom everywhere
Little dark, but it adds to the romance
I've eaten here twice and on both occasions have had a simply wonderful time
The food was quite tasty, the wine selection sufficient, and the service attentive without becoming overbearing
I'd go again!
I loved this place! I've now been twice have to say I haven't been disappointed yet
The food is excellent, and the service is great, from the bus boys to the wait staff!!! They have a great feature of wine flights where you get a 3 course meal w/wine w/each of the courses! It was fantastic!! The decor was really neat too, a great place to take someone who's in NY for a visit!
I took my girlfriends here and we had a nice and quite dinner
The food was good and the service was great
I would recommend the desserts to all
Thalia was a complete disappointment food and service wise
The most upsetting part was the nonchalance of the staff when I called about a shopping bag with some expensive items I had left under the table
I was certain that an upscale restaurant like Thalia would have saved clients' property

all of theirs are generally unique combinations of different fruits and nuts and veggies and chocolate, and they only have about 5 or 6 different varieties every day which change every day
so expect to try something kind of new
But if you're in to fun flavor combinations, you may really like this place
The texture of the chocolate chip banana bread was really nice and the flavor was good as well
but again, just not really worth going all the way to Brooklyn for
If you are in the area however, it's a nice breakfast
The shop itself is quite cute with lots of little tables stacked with different magazines and newspapers, and is decorated in a country/home-y way
Lots of sunlight, very cute :)
I was excited to find Blue Sky Bakery on Fifth Avenue one morning when I was looking for a non-bagel breakfast
Although the muffins were very very good, I must admit to being a bit surprised at the meager non-muffin selection in the bakery
True, Blue Sky has a very inovative take on muffins, mixing pumpkin with zucchini and chocolate chips, but it seems the chef is so focused on coming up with these zany mixtures that he doesn't take the time to make much else
5 muffin choices, 2 pound cake type loafs and chocolate or almond croissants pretty much sums up the choices at this tiny place
There's no doubt about it though, the muffins are excellent (and were warm even at 11:30) and I found myself getting two due to the inability to choose from all the great flavors
The muffins from this bakery are simply legendary
It is worth getting up early, just to arrive at the bakery and be assured the sight of muffins, fresh out of the oven
Every muffin I have had has been equisite - a miniature work of art that melts in my mouth
And each one is warm and moist and fresh out of the oven
You have not tried muffins until you have tried Blue Sky's muffins!
You know those magic moments
when the bagels are just out of the oven, or the mozzerella has just been packed, or the coffee has just been ground -- just as you walked in the door? Well, somehow those very rare, exceptional, and extraordinary moments happen all the time at Blue Sky Bakery
Everytime I go there baked goods are just out of the oven, fresh and hot
And their muffins are incredible, delicious concotions
I keep half expecting a line to be there on Saturday mornings, like Magnolia Bakery, where people wait patiently for their cupcakes to come out of the oven
Then I remember that there is no need for a line, because that magic moment is all day at Blue Sky
I promise
The Scene Schnack feels a lot like a roller-rink concession stand circa 1982, from the deep vinyl booths and beat-up chairs right down to the loud music and plastic menu boards
Domino sugar boxes, billboard art and sundry Brooklyn bric-a-brac decorate the small square room, which is invariably packed with fiercely loyal beer-consuming locals
The Food Harry Hawk (co-owner of Schnack with Patois' Alan Harding and Pacifica's Jim Mamary) is the kind of guy who invents vanilla-stout beer shakes and sends free piles of shoestring onion rings for the kids
Both delights pair exceedingly well with house specialty "schnackies"--one-and-a-half-ounce juicy slider burgers best when laden with add-on chili, cheese and sauteed onions
The diner-esque menu includes locally cured sausages, from snappy Stahl-Meyer dogs to spicy Jubilat kielbasa; sandwiches (including a terrific, cheesy pulled pork Cubano); and one of the crispiest, freshest fish-and-chips this side of the BQE
Schnack was always the staple for late night meals, or a good hangover brunch
However, recently their prices have shot up so much that their staff has become cautious when taking phone orders -- they make sure to tell you your total before hanging up
It's as if they're warning you - or apologizing
This place was cute and comfortable
The music was fun and the food was great
This place is great to go before you go out
It's not super crowded, the food is really good and also they serve pitchers of beer for a good price
I recommend the bacon cheese burger, mmmmmmmmm, and the fries are the best!
Great burgers, however 14 bucks tip included, for two tiny burgers (white castle size) and one all beef hotdog (3
50!) and a soda is outa control
I've been to this place a few times for an afternoon burger
Got to live the idea of small tasty burgers on the cheap
If you are in the area I made it a point to drop by
They should have some t shirts printed up
A great place to fill up after a long day of work or play
Open late, this no nonsense place satisfies the stomach for just a few bucks
Although the carb cravin's can be easily satisfied, there's always vegetarian offerings such as garlic spinach, tofu reubens, and duck dishes
The beer shake (my favorite was vanilla over the chocolate)is not to be missed
Great place to have a group for an all you can eat special outing if you arrange it in advance
When I reviewed Schnack over a year ago I must've had the munchies, because I loved everything
I recently revisited and couldn't figure out what it was that I liked so much
The little burgers are thin and dainty, a bit dry and they're placed on an overpowering whole wheat bun; add the lettuce, tomato and condiment and you cannot taste the burger, it might as well not be in there
They are cheap, yes, but not satisfying
I also walked into their newer location at the Lyceum and quickly ran away
This place seemed like a student run burger joint on some far-off campus
I asked for the burgers, but 10 minutes later I was handed a package with 2 dogs
I was annoyed enough, I didn't complain and left for good
I had a delightful time with my daughter in the afternoon, after school
Wonderful, interesting decor and atmosphere
Very friendly service
The perfect antithesis to the burger chains
Burgers and onion rings were very good, french fries were great!
Its that forbidden college food you gained 15lbs on your freshman year
The onion rings are out of this world, the burgers are outstanding, and the beer is cheap
What more could you want? If you are at all health conscience, stay home
If you aren't, you'll love this place and be back often
I live over an hour away in queens, and I take the subway to make it out there
Its that good
I must say that Schnack is very cheap and the food is great, the catch is you must eat there
Some of my friends and I have ordered or tried to order from there a few times
The first time they it looked like they literally threw our orders in some brown paper bags and shook them
Another time they wouldn't even take our order and told us to come eat at the restaurant
Yet another time they told us that they didn't deliver despite having delivery before
THe moral of the story: eat at the restaurant
Place to hang out, meet up with some friends before going out at 1 AM
I had a double no sauce (mayo based) with Chili and Stahl-Meyer classic Beef dog and fries
My wife had a classic hotdog (Mmmm hotdog) with kraut and a side of garlic taters (Mmmm garlic taters)
Everything was great, I made my own burger topping by added the garlic mashed taters to the chili burger, what a combo (Mmmm Garlic Mashed Potato Chili Burger)
Bread Pudding was good
We were very confused/amused when another patron pointed to our pudding and asked us how the ribs were
The wait staff was cool and attentive
Our waiter was from Fort Wayne, Indiana, we talked football and forgave him for being Colts fan
Will return back with friends to drinking PBRs or beer pitchers whatever gives us more beer (Mmmm Beer)
Waiter advised us; place gets packed Fri/Sat
Harry will sit with you and talk, if your up to it
He gave us samples of stuff he was working on and it was fantastic
This place is like Happy Days and Harry, Arnold best part is you are the FONZ
I've been going to Schnack for around a year now
I always go with my friend, we always order the same meal
2 schnackie cheeseburgers, 1 jubilat sausage and a chocolate beer milkshake
Usually, the service is fast and the food is good but lately, the shakes have been rather crappy
not thick and with too much beer
making them more like egg creams
It really depends on who is doing the food serving
it could go from great, cheap grub to mediocre rather easily
Hope things get better
This place rocked
The Food was great, service was fast
The food was inexpensive and so good
The dessert was good too

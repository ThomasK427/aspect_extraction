I have traveled extensively across the US and tried many upscale Indian restaurants as well as small family diners
Until recently, I thought that the best Indian food I had was up in Vancouver, but Mint quickly proved that notion wrong
I tried some of the appetizers
The food was incredible! You could taste the fresh ingredients used in each dish, as well as the spice level was perfect
Although, I might have preferred a bit less spicy, although it didn't seem to interfere with the taste
I have tried many Indian Restaurants, but this one stands out
Very distinct flavor and very distinct recipes than usually found for Indian cuisines
We tried the Lamb Nilgiri and Saffron Shrimp, and must say I would go back any day
Prices comparitive to what you expect to find in Manhattan, but you get what you pay for
Well stocked bar too, but we didn't try that
Ambience is what the restaurant advertises, and it does meet expectations
Overall experience very satisfying
Can someone tell me if there is any other restaurant better than MINT
I know you guys don't have any answer because MINT is the best restaurant in NYC
I just love the party room they have inside with a big plasma TV where you can watch your favorite sport or news while having such a great food and drinks
This restaurant is the best restaurant I've ever been
EVERYONE SHOULD VISIT MINT
Me and my wife went to have dinner at mint
To be honest, we never had a great dinner than Mint
The ambience and of course the food is just excellent
The Saffron shrimp, which i had was amazing
My wife had the lamb Chops which was very very good
I would highly recommend this restaurant, and have to give the staff and chef a thumb up for creating such a wonderful place
The service is prompt and the people are very friendly
i would recommend this place to all my family and friends
You could get the same food for $6-10 a dish in so many other places
At this place you are paying for the ambience, not the quality of the food
Having said that the layout and design of the place is really not all that special
I dont generally review restaurants and I have created this account just to do so for the New Trendy restaurant i got my birthday surprise at
About 18 other friends of mine took me out a day after my birthday for drinks at Mint
What i didnt know was that this was all pre-planned
The Staff and my friend David had a huge cake ready for me in the private room
This was the best birthday i had ever had since i moved to NY
The restaurant has a really nice Ambience, the service was great, our server Vikram took good care of us and the food was extra ordinary
The Chef and owner Mr Gary was there to make sure my birthday was a success
Thanks to the Mint straff and management
I cant thank you enough but returning you a favor with this review
Magnificently designed, brilliant service, finger-licking food of MINT just sets you in the mood
Proposed my girlfriend in this awesomely set Authentic Indian Jewel and heard whatYESSSS Of course
Credits go to the Just Grand, Aesthetically Perfect and Delicious MINT
Beautiful and long awaited work
i went there 2 weeks ago
i went because of the interesting new name
food was just alright/ i like the decor best a bit busy yet service was awsome
Well a buddy of mine was staying at the W Hotel
We planned to have diner in the neighbourhood
The Concierge at the W recommended us to go to MINT
I really didnt want to go to a Indian restaurant but my buddy insisted so i did
I could notice the restaurant from a block away with the bring green light outside the restaurant
The restaurant is pretty well made which made a great atmosphere for dining
The service, food, music everything was perfect
I would definately recommend MINT which changed my perspective of a Indian restaurant
Me and my wife have been traveled many places around the world
But not only me, even my wife loves indian food
But to be honest, we never had a great dinner than Mint
The ambience and of course the food is just excellent
The Saffron shrimp, which i had was amazing
My wife had the lamb Chops which was very very good
I would highly recommend this restaurant, and have to give the staff and chef a thumb up for creating such a wonderful place
I was passing by the place and thought to go in and check this new place out
To my surprise, I found MINT as one of the best place to have parties or a quite dinner
The colours are awesome, the ambience is just great
The BAR is full of wide range of liquors
Food is fantastic and very tasty, just when you need to have the change
The staff is very freindly and explains the dishes so that you can order what is best for you
Guys, give a try
believe me its worth it!!!
Mint was a surpisingly good restaurant
The ambience is exquisite with a varied clientele
The food was delectable and served in just the right portions
The service was excellent even though the restaurant became amazingly busy
The prices were to be expected from a manhattan restaurant
The only drawback about this place is if you drive there and park at the adjacent parking lot, you pay an ungodly fortune, which marred an otherwise delightful dining experience  Mint will definetly see me again
I always thought that all indian restaurants are the same
but after dinning at Mint, it didnt only change my mind but also changed my vision towards the indian food
I have to say the Lamb Nilgiri is the best, aswell as the Saffron Shrimps
Atmosphere, Service, and the look makes Mint above excellent
LOVE IT
Having dinner at many indian restaurants
i finally found the place to eat, which is MINT
I usually dont spent my time writing reviews but for this one i had to
Mint is just wonderful overall, the food and everything
Lamb Nilgiri and the Chicken Tikka masala are the best dishes in town
I highly recommend MINT
Was highly impressed by the atmosphere in the lounge area, the food was delicious specially the Lasoni Cauliflower and the crispy chicken samosas
I always had a perception that Indian food is very spicy but Mint changed my perception I would highly recommend;)
you have to try this place if you love killer sandwiches my buddy lived in bklyn and always talks abouit their store in park slope well now I finally understand a must try is their cuban press better than most cuban restaurants and their backyard is sweet amazing graffiti piece by local artist
Even though I had no idea what I wanted, Sugarspun came up with the perfect cake for the bridal shower: a bridal gown! The work was so detailed that the bride-to-be refused to cut the cake at the shower
She wanted to take it home and show it off to her fiance
When I spoke to her the next day, she said the cake was delicious too
I now know that if I'm looking for a delicious, creative cake that makes a statement, I don't have to look any further than Sugarspun
I have to say, my first complaint is the close proximity of the tables to one another in the lounge, but this can be subverted by making a reservation which I did not
That being said, our cocktails were fine, the ambience is ok
Refined, Upscale, but by no means something to brag about--typical uptown decor
The food is actually quite interesting
I recommend sticking with multiple starters as the mains are really tiny
My softshell crab was literally two bites--delicious bites I must say though
It was a couple hundred bucks for two but well spent
Definitely a solid restaurant
Great service

If you are looking for good southern food set in a clean, friendly, and upscale enviroment- JUSTIN'S IS THE PLACE FOR YOU
Absolutely delicious!
I just went to Justin's last week and it was one of the best dining experiences
The food was great, and the drinks were excellent, definitely not watered down
The portions were satisfying, and the servers were so nice and accomodating
I can't wait to come back again!
I had a wonderful time
The service was impecable
The food was outstanding
I couldn't complain
I did this citysearch before I left on my vacation to New York in early May of 2003
I've been to the Justin's in Atlanta; their buffet was excellent
However the only reviews I had heard about the New York location were mediocre siting their recent run in with the law as part of the reason
Needless to say I was taken aback by the food
I had the Carribean Chicken and it was great! The white-meat chicken was sooooo tender! The sauce was outstanding and the potatoes did not taste powdered
The server, however did overdo his presentation just a little bit when asked about the fish
Whereas he could have just said it was farm raised shipped from the south, he stated that it was imported
what? The hip-hop DJ was good and the ambiance was very nice
This place is highly recommended!
If you enjoy hip-hop/rap music + being around the young African american vibe it'll be ok for you
If you dont then dont go
Soul food dishes and some standard american dishes that taste OK
I had the salmon dish I believe it was
A little to pricey I think
I enjoy going to Justins after work sometimes to unwind
I enjoy the atmosphere, especially hanging at the bar
Always interesting people to meet
No, it's not about P
Diddy, but we loved this restaurant
The staff is extremely friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was laid back and relaxed
Loved it
2 friends and I visited Justin's, on vaction from Chicago
The hostesses were not welcoming, although nice
The catfish was soggy and bland
The greens were ok, but probably were too salty for those who don't hail from the south (I do) or don't have access to authentic southern cooking
I also found it appaulling to have so much of a plate showing for the price
Could have drizelled sauce or added something (parsley?) to make it look fuller
The pineapple martinis were overpriced for the amount of liquor that was used (watery)
How tacky to have a DJ at a restaurant?! It was also tacky to add an 18% tip, regardless of the size of the party
However, the service was so excellent, we added $10 to the tip! This was probably the worst 160 bucks I have ever spent
Will not be back
I went here with some friends on a Friday night in late November
We had a reservation, but still had to wait
The DJ was good but way too loud
You really couldn't have a decent conversation
Also, everyone at the table is required to order an entree, which is ridiculous
We had a reservation at 11:00pm
I had already eaten, but fortunately, our server made an exception, I ended up with some seasoned fries
The drinks were good, but expensive
This restaurant is all hype
You can find a better meal for the money that you are spending elsewhere
This place i checked strictly because of who owns the place
The waitresses were beautiful, on a good night you will see visiting basketball players to say the least inside waiting to be seated by the bar
The Catfish fritters are delicious
A bit pricey and tight , but cozy
The ambience makes up for it
I went here with 2 friends
We enjoyed the food and the drinks
I thought the staff was friendly
The prices were not that bad,typical for a restaurant in that area
I would go back again
Resist temptation and don't go here! The food tasted like three-hour long soggy McDonald's, and that's a compliment! The fries were absolutly inedible, and the coldslaw tasted like it was straight out of a bucket from Sam's, and the friend shrimp had too much curry
YUCK! And what's worse were the Nobu-esque prices! $25 for the above meal
what a rip
Decor was ok and our waiter was nice: he saved me from giving this the lowest rating
This is one of the worst restaurants I've been to in a long time
The food was terrible
The appetizers included a bunch of poorly fried (greasy) shrimp, chicken wings and catfish
For dinner the biggest disappointment was the fried chicken
It was soggy, had no crust and was very greasy
I've had much better chicken at KFC
This is the first restaurant that I've ever been to that automaticaly charges an 18% tip on all tables (regardless of size) on Fri
and Sat
While I didn't like the food, the service was actually very good
The staff was attenative and cordial
The music was also very good
I continue to believe that this restaurant has potential to be better
I say to myself this will be the last time I go, but then I end up going next time and the food is fantastic
I don't understand the change of taste in the food each time I go to justin's
I love the atmosphere, the look , the great staff and the drinks
I just hope my nest visit will be as good as the first
We went to Justin's just to go
although we heard the food wasn't good
The vegetables were too salty and the wings weren't even as good as the ones I make at home
The reason for that, we found out, was because the chef isn't there all the time
So there basically isn't any consistency in the taste of the food
One day, you may happen to go when the chef is in and taste the best food ever, another time you go and the chef's not there so your food is either gross, bland, or just alright
Isn't Puffy worth over 4hundred million? He can't hire a permanent chef for his restaurant?? The ambiance and service is great but I wish I could say the same about the food
My advice to you is to try to find out if the chef is there first before you waste your money
Normally when you think of celebrity restaurant, you think long lines, bad service and crappy food
This was not the case when it came to Justin's
No wait , excellent service, and the food was a 10 plus, and you must have some of the warn muffins and cornbread fresh from the oven
Please don't waste your precious earned money on this place
The food was horrible, it was either overcooked or undercoked no in between! And I went twice to try to give P-Diddy the benefit of doubt, he should stick to Remixes or hire a new cook! The only thing good about Justins is the ambience, it is lovely inside but once you taste the food you never want to go back
I ordered the P Diddy's Fried Shrimp, I was pleased with it, the seasoning was very good
I also had a drink which was called Justin's, that was also good! I would go back there again
PurplePassion
The food here is really nasty
I'm sure if Puffy didn't own it, it still wouldn't be in business
I went with 7 other friends and we basically ordered different things to try and oh boy were all of us disappointed

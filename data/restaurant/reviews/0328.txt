exceptional
Everything else we ordered was no better than average including the dessert
The atmospher is kinda of cool, boardering on dreery at times
Do not go for a late night meal or if you are under the age of 50
Ouest - once again we were treated to wonderful food and a special/different menu
This place is always a treat
Stands out on the UWS like a oasis
This was the best meal I have had on the Upper West Side in years
Also, the decor is lovely and the service couldn't be better! Those poor reviews are surely from bitter ex-employees!
For starters, this is a locals restaurant, very comfortable and not at all pretensious
Yet, the food was fabulous and the service was excellent
Sure the price is a bit of a stretch for a casual dinner but it's well worth it
While it was a bit pricy, I must admit the food was excellent and the service was top notch
A definite must try for the Manhattan food snob
The food is exccellent, the atmosphere is above the average
However, it is a little bit pricy
I'm not sure I went to the same restaurant as those people complaining about the service
The service was excellent
The food (the short ribs and the scallops) was excellent, although the desserts were a bit underwhelming
The price wasn't bad either
Thought skeptical at first, I ended up enjoying my meal and the overal experience of eating at Ouest quite a bit
Thought I didn't have reservations, the hostess politely informed me that it would be a 45 minute wait and we were actually seated in 40
The decor was beautiful but not pretentious, the food was inventive, interesting and tasty
And in the end, the bill was very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food
Highly recommended
Overrated, and unapologetic to boot
Worst service I've had in NYC
$28 filet mignon came out after an hour and was ice cold
Other entrees were barely warm
Asked server to return for hotter food and she became defensive
Sat there on a Mon
night for 4 hours with no refilling of water, wine, checking back, nothing
Asked for mgr
and was told You win some, you lose some
Yes, I guess after paying $250 we certainly lost
But they'll lose customers if they keep this up
i dunno why all the critics are raving about this place! granted it's the only worthwhile neighborhood bar up front, but the food is bland and mediocre
The Scene Even if you happen to miss the cow sculpture standing sentinel near the entrance, it would be difficult to mistake MarkJoseph for anything but a steakhouse
All the trappings are there: loud-mouthed, avuncular waiters with rolled-up shirtsleeves, country club-like decor and a predominantly male crowd
The Food Ruffian atmospherics notwithstanding, nothing tops the bloody, visceral fun of the dry-aged steaks
Sirloins and porterhouses (offered in cuts that serve up to four) come caked with a charcoal-black, sooty crust that splinters audibly when you slice into it
The interiors are glistening red and butter-soft--it's nothing short of spectacular
Appetizers and desserts are also strong; try the sturdy slices of sweet-tasting beefsteak tomato with fresh mozzarella or the whipped cream-laden three-berry pie
I have been a quest for the truly best steakouse in NYC, I finally got to finish up the list last week with a meal at Blair and Perone
By the way the place is weak! Now, MARK JOSESPH on the other hand is the bomb! After eating at all the restaurants in NYC, my view is supported by the following
The service is amazing, the waiters remember who you are, and always treat you with respect
The don't bother you with too much in your face service
The make sure you get what you need, when you want
Given that I always go to this place with a large group, they surely know how to serve hungry men
The porterhouse is to die for
They make sure not to overcook it
I am a rare guy
They even accomodate this less manly men who need to it cooked more, but cooking it for them on the plate
The bacon is amazing, i am still not sure what it is
Those shrimp where to get shrimp that big
I am still craving my meal
Shrimp cocktail, Bacon, Creamed Spinach (so many steakhouse don't have creamed spinach what up with that), porterhosue, and apple pie al mode of course
What could be better
It is the best money you can spend on a meal in NYC
You won't come away hungry
Be srue to vaidate your parking
The whole area around the place is chaning it is nice to walk around after
That being said, this place rocks out!   I love it!   AV
From the time you walk through the door you know you have arrived at the best restaurant in new york city
The aroma of the sizzling steaks overcomes you as you can hardly wait to be seated
Everyone is greeted as a regular by the hostess, Jenna - and you should take her up on her offer to have a drink at the bar
Tito or Jarred are more than happy to make you the drink of your choice, my recommendation is to try one of their martinis - probably the best in Manhattan
Once seated you will want to immediately order the famous porterhouse - but be sure to at least try the bacon and fried calamari! The hash browns are crispy and will leave you wanting more and the spinach will not disappoint
You don't want to overlook this great restaurant if you are not a steakfan - the seafood entrees are superb -as is the lobster ravioli (topped with jumbo shrimp)
Dessert is a must - awesome pecan pie! Just thinking about it makes me want to call for a reservation and go back there tonight! MarkJoseph Steakhouse is located downtown - right in the seaport near the Brooklyn Bridge but a definite must - no matter where you are in the city!
Have been there twice
Both times, waiters sat down with us to discuss order-so, very warm and friendly
Mussels in white sauce (appetizer)-to die for
Dirty Martinis-PERFECT
Steak-superb
Even though it was steak for two, individually prepared-one side was medium, other side was medium/rare
Perfect
We are Brooklynites, yet prefer Mark Joseph to cold and impersonal Lugers
AND, WE ARE STEAK LOVERS! After strolling through and shopping at Seaport, capping the evening off with dinner at Mark Joseph is definitely the thing to do
I've been to all the rest
Markjoseph is the BEST! If you are looking for the best porterhouse in NYC - Markjoseph Steakhouse is the place you want to be! Went for drinks after work - great location near Wall Street - luckily we were able to be squeezed in - 10 of us sat for dinner! Great service - porterhouse was so good I can still taste it - Can't wait to go back - I've been craving the bacon appetizer! Markjoseph is my #1 choice for Best NYC Steakhouse!
Love the cuts, the location, not so much
Super meat, but for my money, the old homestead notches MJ out by a tbone
and the cow sculptures just dont compare
all in, MJs still a beefery among beeferies
Happy artery cloggin!
I loved the porterhouse for two, true prime meat, we came from long island, and we loved the food and the service
The swordfish special was also very good
Great ice cold martinis
I have dined at Mark Joseph dozens of times since it opened, but on my most recent visit things just weren't the same
As a female executive, I was always greeted with familiar warmth
It was non- exisistant on this visit
My porterhouse was was fatty, my hash browns were not piping hot and I had to flag the waiter down to get my check
I was quite disappointed overall
Mark Joseph is NOT what it used to be
I have been to MarkJoseph's several times since it opened about 5 years ago but this time was by far the best
The new management is exactly what this great steakhouse needed! The steak was done to perfection and I highly recommend adding a lobster tail to your meal (unbelievable!) and the side dishes will keep your mouth watering until you come back again
Don't forget to order the salad - the bacon is to die for - and a seafood platter is a great way to start
too much to enjoy in just one visit
Did I mention the wine list - Top of the line! If you haven't eaten at MarkJoseph's recently I strongly suggest you try it again!

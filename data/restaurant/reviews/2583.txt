We thought the food was great, the pasta outstanding!, and the value tremendous
For large groups and families and for those of us that are budget conscious, its a great choice
We had tickets to Movin Out last Thursay and were recommended to Becco by a friend who swears by the place
After reading the reviews here I wasn't sure
There's alot of truth in them all
The food is fantastic, the service is great and it is crowded
Tables are smaller than I'd like, but prices are reasonable enough to justify, and it seems there's plenty of demand
We'll go back next time after the theater rush
Whether you're off to a show or not, Becco was a very average stop
The pirce-fixe wine list is a good idea, but finding something tasty is very difficult and I found myself wishing I would have brought my own bottle and asked for a corkage fee
Tables were too small, as they handles the budtle of the pre-theatre crowd, I found myself having to move thinsg off the table to fit the over-sized plates
They were very consciencious about fixing teh wine problem, and getting us out on time for the show - that we appreciate!
I was there Saturday night and had a fantastic meal and service
Had to wait less than 10 mins
for our reserved table but was given complementary champagne and desserts
Overall, very satisfied and would definately recommend stopping in for dinner
This is one of my favorite restaurants for dining
However, I was there this past Saturday night, 2/18/05 and it was one of the increasingly more and more less than pleasant experiences
The tables are so close, the waiters/wait staff/helpers kept bumping in to me constantly trying to get to other tables that were near us
The table itself has little if no space for the appetizers they bring out, and you feel extremely cramped
You are so close to each other, it's like you are invading others privacy
Love the food, but really dislike the cramped feeling
The restaurant is so crowded and noisy, and the food is very expensive
It's hard to even walk through the place, you have to shout to be heard, and there are always busboys moving tables and running about with skillets of pasta
You could pay half as much at other places, have better food, and certainly be in a less frazzled environment
This place is fabulous! Took a group of 5 this Saturday
great food and the service was amazing! We had two waiters the entire night helping! Definitely get the 3 pasta course
either as meal or add on
so worth it! Also, take advantage of the $25 wine menu!
I walked in without reservations on a busy Friday evening and was shown to the back bar where my friend and I got to try different wines for free along with delicious olives and breadsticks
We waited about 15 minutes before being seated in a cozy spot next to the patio doors
The ambience in that room was better since it was darker and quieter, plus great exposed brick walls
The service was friendly and prompt
The food was hot and plentiful, plus we ordered a three pasta special, which we got to share and was divine
We were very sorry that we ate so much that we couldn't try a dessert
Finally, for one glass of wine and an entree per person, we each paid $36
00 including tip
One of the best meals I've had in a long time combined with the vakue that was excellent
The only thing that could have made it better would have been having Lydia there herself
Service was quick and very polite and helpful!!! The three pasta special was our choice with the $25 bottle of wine that the waitress seleceted for us
I'll Be Back
I ate in this restaurant twice during my stay in NY
Our evening meal was slightly disapointing
The food itself was fine but we were seated at the back of the restaurant where the tables were too close together, really intrusive on the people either side
I would request a table at the front, much better
Also we ordered a reserve wine and I was slighty annoyed that when they took it away to open it, they did not bring back the bottle to show us, even though I queried this, so it left us in doubt of what wine we were drinking
When we had lunch on the Tuesday it was less busy and we were seated at the front
The service was great and the food lovely (set 3 pasta menu)
I would definately return either pre-theatre or lunch, not for the whole evening
NICE LITTLE PLACE IN RESTAURANT ROW IN THEATER DISTRICT, FOOD WAS OUTSTANDING, SERVICE VERY GOOD, AND PRICES FOR NYC WERE REASONABLE
CHECK IT OUT YOU WON'T BE SORRY
Took my girlfriend during a recent weekend in the city
Family members have always raved about Becco so I decided to give it a shot - we were not disappointed
The service was outstanding, they were even accomodating to my girlfriend who is a vegetarian (since she couldn't eat the lobster ravioli that was part of the price fixed meal, they made her a special order of spinach ravioli!)
Great selection of wines, delicious food all around, wonderful service, we will certainly be there again!
Average food, noisy room, high prices
this place has it all! The out-of-towners writing rave reviews obviously have no idea that you can get *excellent* Italian food in NYC for the same price elsewhere, and get very good Italian food for much cheaper somewhere else, too
If you live in NYC, you already knew this
For the toursts: check out the many great places in the East Village or uptown
There's a reason why the locals only eat in midtown for business lunches
Considering how many expensive restaurants there are in NYC, it is wonderful to find somewhere to enjoy a delicious meal and not go broke
Becco is that place
I went before a show with my girlfriend and the waitstaff is very conscious of your time limitations but they don't rush you out either
The food was absolutely delicious (you must try the osso bucco) and as stated in the previous post, the dessert sampler is one of the best deals for dessert in all of NYC
Highly recommended restaurant row choice
Give it a try!
This is my # 1 favorite restaurant in the city and beyond comapre in the theatre district
The prixe fix menu is Fanastic
so much food
and the pastas
THE BEST! Wonderul atmosphere
prefer the back room or upstairs
The dessert sampler platter is THE BEST DESSERT DEAL ANY WHERE!
Raves do not apply to this little cafe for the food
The pastas were very salty without decent flavor
They relied on unusual pairings
The pasta itself was fresh but undercooked
We did like the 20 dollar wine list because it was unpretentious and the our waiter was great!
I've longed to taste Lidia's meals and salivate at the sight of her creations on TV, so when I went to her restaurant, I expected the best
I got even better! The food was inventive and delicious and the service was impeccable
I highly recommend it!
Well prepared and delicious food along with friendly service would keep us coming back
The food and wine came out at a quick pace which helped to take your mind off of the uncomfortable chairs
The $20 wine list is a rare find with a great selection of table wines
Order off the reserve list and you receive Reidel Crystal
Very enjoyable!
With so many excellent choices for Italian cuisine in the city, it's perplexing that Becco has received such a positive response
As another reviewer stated, it's just a pre-theater fix for tourists
That should tell you all you need to know right there
Everyone who knows NYC well knows that Times Square caters specifically to those who are too starstruck to notice that the food is sub-par at best
Try a different neighborhood for REAL New York food
It's not at ESPN Zone, mind you
The service was very uncoordinated
It was as if the waitress and the several men helping her didn't talk because noone knew what the other had done or not done
My friend I both ordered the pasta pre-fixe and she was given a plate and I was not
She was served and I waited at least 5 minutes before I even got a plate
There were so many issues, but what could have made up for it was a waitress with a good disposition, not a snarly one
The food was good though and I would return with the hopes of receiving better service
Lydia was there signing cookbooks, it was fun to get a glance of the tv chef
Becco is a much better value and establishment than Felidia has turned out to be

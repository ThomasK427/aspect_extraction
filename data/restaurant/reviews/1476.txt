By day it is very cafe-like, where people eat paninis, salads, or wraps, while others sip on coffees or wine
The burger is amazing! At night, it becomes more of a lounge, where the lights dim as cool chill music plays in the background
Their brunch is great and prices are very good
Service is average, but very friendly
I was at Marbella and all i can tell is it is a not recomended place for dinner
The service is really bad and the food is overpriced
After reading the reviews here I expected a very busy, social, perfect 10 restaurant
So we were a little dissapointed to walk in at 9:15 on a Saturday night and be one of 5 tables there at the time
So it was a little empty
The prices are very high for tapas
Period
They start at $9- for an asparagus tapas even
The service was good in the beginning until the servers realized we were going to be there for a while to finish the huge sangria pitcher we bought (which was excellent
) After that they stopped pouring our drinks
Also we ordered using the english translations below the spanish dish names and that was a mistake
Our waitress messed up the order and then gave us ATTITUDE about it when we told her
We let that go- maybe she had a bad night
She had been very friendly up until then
The decor is ok
The bathroom??? I mean, it's ok
It's a bathroom
I think all these reviews were posted by people connected to the restaurant
I have lived in a lot of different places and have tried a lot of different food
We finally discovered Marbella and it is by far the best
It actually has flavor!!! Everyone should try it if you want some good food
You have to try the Sangria and The Tapas
The Best!
I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews
I went a few weeks ago and had the most attentive, friendly, and helpful service
The food was excellent and creative - and fortunately a departure from a lot of the traditional tapas joints (I know where to go if that's what I'm looking for)
Yes, it was a bit on the expensive side, but so it might not be the best fit for those diners watching their budget
For those looking for a lively time at a place where they don't mind spending the appropriate amount for excellent dining, this is a great choice
Great place to enjoy both with your family and with friends, i was there on Friday night with my family and we had a wonderful time, the food is delicious and tasty, the service is outstanding everyone there was so nice and attentive, we enjoyed the flamenco dancer and the music, it made me want to get up there and dance with them
Just by looking at Marbella from the outside caught our eyes immediately, we loved it, it's such a clean place that you can actually eat from the floor, i highly recommend it to everyone you won't regret it, from a scale from 1 to 10 i rate it a 20+
My husband and i wanted to go somewhere we hadn't been before and feel like we had left the city
Marbella was the place to go
The service was prompt courteous and attentive
Let's not forget the food
The Tapas was extraordinarily good, particularly Carne Asada, Shrimp in garlic sauce, the BEST Empanadas in the city and a homemade Flan TO DIE FOR! The Sangria was outstanding and very reasonably priced than most places in the city
The ambiance was cozy, elegant and very clean
I recommend without hesitation
You must go! You won't regret it!
I took my girlfriend to this restaurant and she loved it! I got a good credit for it
Nice decor and tasty food
My girlfried loved these tapas and I loved them
too
My girlfriend even loved the bathroom and I had to check it out
Indeed, it was gorgeous
True gem in New York City
Must check it out!
First of all, it's poor class to make personal attacks on anyone
This website is dedicated to represent food and service only
Second, it's ridiculous to criticize food price versus portion
If these reviewers were educated restaurant-goers, then they would know that top restaurants, such as french gourmet, serve miniscule, rich food at skyrocketing prices
The small pitcher of sangria serves about 4-5 glasses, costing only $21 - opposed to NYC Standard $10 per glass of anything besides beer
And the paella for two is actually too much food for two! People need to realize that Tapas inherently mean small plates - tasting size portions
Third, nothing in New York is for free except for Marbella's magnificent flamenco show with real dancers from Spain
Finally, it could be true that an employee left positive feeback, but it could also be true that a FIRED employee left spiteful, vengeful, negative feedback!
I celebrated a birthday in the restaurant and the hostess was very nice when I brought in a home-made cake for dessert for a suprise
Usually, other restaurants charge $6 per person for serving it when bringing in desserts from other places, but they did it for free! Marbella gave my friend a surprise by bringing her up to the stage and having 2 amazing flamenco dancers danced around her
We ordered a pitcher of sangria with red wine and it tasted great
We ordered the steak, arroz con pollo y chorizo, croquettas, and empanadas
It was delicious
Although the platters are not that big, but the food was definitely to savor! The prices are not that bad and is considerable the same to other Spanish Restaurants
As we were eating, we enjoyed the enticing spanish music and flamenco dancing that makes people want to get up and start dancing!
I tried this restaurant almost 3 times
I had high hopes
The first time we sat outside and the service was excellent and the food was OK
The second time I was with 3 friends and 2 toddlers and the day manager outright refused to seat us even though the place was empty
The receptionist was pleasant but the manager was mean for no reason at all
We were flabbergasted
The last time I went with 3 friends and 1 toddler
We had reservations and were seated at a table comfortably set up for 2
They told us that the toddler doesn't need space
(Anyone who's eaten with a toddler knows how ridiculous this actually is
) The toddler could actually eat off the neighboring table, which made them quite upset
And one of my friends was sitting sideways! It was a terrible experience and only the waitress seemed competant, but tired
To top it all off, we waited 15 minutes for them to find the stroller before we could get out of there
If you DO go, I can recommend the duck, but not the steak frites, trout, salmon or chicken dishes
Train station welcomes the new express engine
If you call this gentrification then every neighbourhood should welcome it
Only if the kitchen would keep the side doors closed would the experiance be better
watching the coals being put into the engine makes it a messy experiance
This restaurant has the best of both worlds
We had brunch there and the food was amazing
All four of our dishes were oustanding
The eggs, the french toast, waffles and pancakes were among the best I have had in some time
Food aside, this restaurant has the worst service of any place I have been to in a long time
It took forever for the waiter to come over, even longer to get drinks and the waiter disappeared and never brought more water, coffee or maple syrup
If we had not walked around the restaurant to find him we may still be there
Not to mention there was no one in the restaurant so there were no excuses
So overall, great food but be prepared to sit and sit and sit and sit
I went a week ago so this post is late but I can still taste the food
Cafe d'Alsace would be hip crowded in any neighborhood in Manhattan
the fact that the East Side has it is a score for me
I'll be back soon for more of the duck sausage and Belgian ales
Reasonably priced fabulous food!  All those delicacies you can't find in NY - such as Moelle, Frog's Legs, Lapin, etc and the desserts ! Whoa! The warm flourless chocolate cake served with homemade pistachio ice cream is to die for! Watch out for the espressos - they're delicious but deadly! Just excellent - that's all I can say
A friend and I walked by Ronald's a few weeks ago and decided to try it
At first we were skeptical, because the sign outside is really cheap looking, and the name is questionable
But we saw they had a wood oven so we went in there anyway and had a positive experience

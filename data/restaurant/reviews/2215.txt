While on business in New York, Trattoria was suggested to me by a native
Had a very enjoyable meal
Outstanding antipasti bar, good pasta and very good service
Ambiance was fun and as a solo diner they made me feel very comfortable
I will be back
Nice restaurant with friendly staff
The service was good eaven tgough it was crowded
The mussels were good size and there was plenty of them for an appeizer
The steaks were a little overcooked, but delicious nonetheless
Although the food was quite good, I must say I felt like I was in a cafeteria
As soon as they took our appetizers away, there was someone handing me my entree
I'm sorry, but I need a few minutes to relax and sip my beverage before having food shoved in my face
This is definitely not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet dinner
The waiter/waitress staff clearly are looking to get you out as quick as possible and management needs to be made aware of this
Also, the lighting on the ground floor makes you feel like you're in a library
way too bright
I was disappointed with the entire experience
Don't plan on going back anytime soon
Food is good - but no better than any other italian restaurant in NY; service/ambience, again - ok, but no better than the others
Biggest complaint - the wine list - don't offer good vintages on the menu and bring over different years upon ordering - 1998 is NOT the same as 1997
For the price - try another restaurant
I can't explain the bad ratings
This has been one of my favorite restaurants for years! The desserts are amazing (esp
choc
cheesecake) and I've always received good service
Fav
dishes: mushroom risotto, pasta w/lobster and truffle oil, seafood stew w/toast appetizer, salmon cooked in clay pot
For more intimate tables, ask for upstairs seating
We've gone here for Valentine's Day 2 years in a row--not very romantic, but they don't price gouge like everybody else in town!
I live right next store and would recommend this place to anyone who just wants a simple, cheap, filing breakfast/lunch
The place is a little dirty and there are kids running around everywhere but the food makes up for it
The sausages look a little funky, but try them
Very good diner food
We have to stop in every time we are in town, no matter what the time
A great stop for breakfast any time (open 24 hours)
We randomly decided to stop in for a bite several months ago and decided to return
The grilled cheese with bacon and tomatoe is tasty as well as the baked potatoes
The eggs are a bit greasy, but what do you expect from a diner
The space really doesnt have a pleasing ambiance, unless you like 70s HoJos beige, with matching acoustic high-school ceiling tiles
We decided to start with a couple glasses of acceptable champagne, which we later found cost fourteen dollars
Upon reading the $44 prix fixe menu (a fair price for good food), we realized half of the Appetizers and Entrees required an additional supplement ranging from five dollars to $105! Really, no typo
We were shocked at this blatant gouging, particularly considering many standard French items; steak au poive, crme Brule, etc would require extra cash
We have no objection to paying good money for good food, but this seems to lack class
After a wretched meal, desert was a relief, but not as much as getting out of there
This was a wonderful dinning experience and the perfect spot to go to for dinner before our show at the Gershwin (which is just 1 block away)
We picked this place because their pre-theater menu had many more options than other restaurants
The food was wonderful
I highly recommend the warm goat cheese appetizer
Both of our dinners were good, stuffed quail and veal medallions
The best part was dessert: chocolate souffl! The restaurant was cozy without feeling cramped
The service was good
The atmosphere was romantic but not pretentious
I took my 16 year old niece to NYC for her birthday
Rene Pujol was simply wonderful! Ambiance is charming
Had difficulty getting a cab from the Waldorf, so we were about 15 mins late, but they still greeted us warmly as though we were precisely on time
Service was impeccable
Immediately was offered menus and bar service
Served a wonderful roasted eggplant dip and crostini within minutes of sitting down
Had the goat cheese and potato appetizer and the chicken with capers entree
My niece is a vegetarian and the roasted vegetable entree was perfect
Allow about 90 mins to get thru the meal and enjoy
Service not rushed nor was it too slow or snobby just relaxing and nice
We left for a cruise the next day and both of us commented for several days on our pleasant evening at Rene Pujol the theater
This was my second visit to this French treasure
The restaurant has a strong menu of diverse offerings, but I tend to focus on the specials of the evening
On this night the Duck L'Orange was exceptional, and the Chilian Seabass moist and flavorful
This is a relaxed country inn in the middle of Manhattan
The wait staff is attentive and helpful
They will offer suggestions when asked, and were on the mark with the recommendation of the chocolate souffle' for dessert
There is something subtle about your dining experience here, a difference that separates good restaurants from the very special ones
It is not until you are about to leave Rene Pujol that you suddenly realize, everything was perfect
I took my girlfriend to Renee Pugol before the opera on the recommendation of my boss
I expected the standard rushed pre-theatre fare: good food, moderately priced, with a rush on the service
The food was better than expected, the service attentive without making us feel like we had to rush through the meal, and the ambiance superb
As for the food - I would strongly recommend the lamb, wich my girlfriend had, or the duck which was the best I've had to date
The waiter made a very good suggestion on the wine, a burgundy that was well priced
All inclusive, we probably had one of our best dates for under $130
I never felt rushed and found the entire experience to be delightful
If you have a theatre date, you have to start here
Oh, and the desserts are fantastic
while vacationing in NY, we enjoyed a nice dinner at Rene Pujol
Our waiter, while not the most personable, did his job, and the food was excellent
The escargot appetizer was delicious and desserts were great too
A nice find
6/5/02 Our lunch today at Rene Pujol was good
From the start the service was off
We were asked if we wanted something from the bar
We requested Ice Tea
The fact that we wanted tap water an not bottled raised an eyebrow
We were not given menus, waited fifteen minutes and had to ask for them
The waiter was clearly annoyed This, in an almost empty restaurant
We had to ask for bread
Our tapanade and crustini were wisked off the table before we had a chance to try them
The steak knife was brought when the entree was almost finished
I always enjoy eating at Bello
The decor and service you receive surpasses anything you will find along 9th avenue
This place has been in business a while and has consistently delivers on quality
I also used their private party room- which everyone seemed to enjoy
Terrible experience
The food was wonderful, however

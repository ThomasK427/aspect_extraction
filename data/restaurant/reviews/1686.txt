The Food Despite the traditional atmosphere, the more adventurous dishes come off best
Appetizers like escargot perched inside mushrooms and clams laden with bacon offer piquant surprises that humdrum prosciutto and melon or mushy spaghetti bolognese just can't match--although when the kitchen does nail a classic, like gnocci with the perfect tomato and basil sauce or scampi bathed in a pellucid white wine, lemon and butter sauce, you'll appreciate the simple things in life
The centerpiece is a tender, falling-off-the-bone rack of lamb special that's generous enough for two
This place serves really fantastic, standard Italian dishes
The antipasto that is set on the table in the minutes before even getting the menus is a very nice touch
The service is outstanding, yet in no way overbearing
The ambience isn't the greatest in the city, and it's pretty loud, but that seems almost irrelevant given the quality of everything else
We will be returning
I have heard about this place for many years
I finally had the opportunity to eat here last night
I think I was afraid that after you here so many wonderful things about a place, you are afraid it cannot hold up to it
We had excellent service and we were showered with very unique, fresh and delicious starters (even before our appy)
Then we ate the Antipasto for two which was also excellent
I ordered the Baby Lobsters with wine and garlic
I must say this was one of the best meals I have ever eaten! Even the desert was soo good
Leave lots of room for food when you go!  If I had to say something negative it would only be that the lighting is very dim
A great romantic find! Also, two people with appy's came to 260
00 with tip
I would go back in a minute!
this one of the worst dining experiences I have had in NYC
we were rushed through our meal, which was very average and the check was outrageous ---$32 for a side of veggies!!! will never go back or recommend - total rip-off
My boyfriend and I went here for Valentines day last weekend - and it was perfect! In addition to fantastic food and about 4 complimentary appetizers, the waitstaff was wonderful
They brought every woman a rose, and set us chocolate hearts with the check
I loved the atmosphere, and the fact that the staff went that extra step to make valentines day special
This is a great place and we can't wait to go back
The only thing is to be wary of the prices of the specials, which were considerably more expensive than the menu prices
Regardless, it was a fantastic dinner and evening
This is far and away my favorite restaurant in NYC! Great service and unbelievable food
The other reviews who rated the food medicore are insane
Go w/ whatever the Maitre'D reccomends
One thing to note definitley bring the expense account
The food is always excellent, especially the pasta starters cooked table-side
The rack of lamb is superior to all of the main courses
Why do some waiters believe they have something to feel superior about? God only knows
Great place for a business dinner
This was a wonderful little restaurant
The only con was the service was so attentive there was alittle too much bustling around the tables
Excellent food and very kind wait staff
It's all about the food here
Order ANY pasta special -- they are all very fresh and excellent
Zabaglione with fresh berries was great for dessert
Exceptionally good, service is impeccable
food is wonderful
atmosphere is cozy
Just outstanding, though the one complaint would be the simplicity of the menu
It was an exceptional meal with excellent service
The tables were a little close to each other and someone farted next to us
Besides that, it was great
The moment you walk into the restaurant you are greeted by a friendly host
The minute you sit down you are given free tastings by professional, friendly staff
The food is exceptional
The decor is beautiful
Can I make one suggestion? Replace the chairs with larger, more comfortable ones
This was an outstanding eating experience
Classic old-line italian restaurant
You' be full before your appetizer arrives
Great service
My fiancee and I dined here earlier this year in attempt to find a good Italian restaurant in Lower Manhattan
The staff was very accomodating and kept on bringing over sampler after sampler (salami, bread, bruchetta, parmesan)
However, the entrees (fish and pasta w/ shrimp) were both bland and very oily - the fish being one of the worst I've had at an Italian rest, and the appetizers were immemorabke
The service was good, if a little slow, and the place was very crowded (which can be comforting, but on a date it may be hard with the constant noise)
I've been a regular at this restaurant for the past 2 months and have had the pleasure in seeing it get better and better
The new owners have fixed up the place, added new items to the menu, and provide larger portions
The food is remarkable! Although I usually go out mid-week for lunch, I now make it a habit to stop out Thursday or Friday evening to enjoy the live Jazz band
A great addition to a great restaurant, and a wonderful way to wind down before the weekend
It's a nice place to take a date, without hurting the pocket
(try the complimentary homemade potato chips)
The decor was open, warm, friendly, and private
The bartender and waitress were prompt, cordial, attentive and efficient
I tried the crab cakes and blacken tuna
Both were fresh, every bite was a joy and filling
I noticed other tables, had ordered the burgers looked big and the Delmonico steak looked just done right
I must try them on my next visit
Later in the evening it was karaoke, normally I would leave at this time
Glad I did not it was funny and some good performers
A bright, lively and amiable place and people in lower Manhattan after 11PM
I discovered recent new management has made major improvements at this location ie the bar, dining areas, party room and bathrooms and keeping the kitchen open after 11PM
Whenever I feel like spending more than $5 on lunch, I hit 17 Murray! The staff is friendly and very accomodating for large groups
we like to eat lunch here for promotion lunches, etc
but I would recommend making a reservation
Prices are very reasonable
Everything on the menu is great, from the pasta to the salads to the burgers and clubs
This place would be a great find for the tourists visiting the City Hall area
Last time I was in here, I saw Al Sharpton!!
i visit the city several times a year
i would highly recommend the food its fantastic
the service is great as well also just to go in and hang out is great as well not noisy and not smoky at all
good mix of people as well
What a greek diner should be! large menu good food at reasonable price
clean - not like socrates nearby and fast delivery
Classic hole in the wall joint serving delicious authentic Indian Fare
You know its good because the cab drivers eat there
The price is also right, my combination plate was huge with a meat dish and two vegetables over rice for five bucks
Great value for the money
Always made fresh to order, the owner (Anthony?) is very friendly and treats the customer #1
A great slice too
I went to H Z fried chicken
I had brought some people in from out of town and I had promised them a real New York City surprise
Imagine my embarrassment when the chickens were NO LARGER THAN ANY PLACE IN NEW YORK!!!1 These were ordinary sized chickens
I don't know if the name of the restaurant is referring to the size of the place itself, but it's not that big either

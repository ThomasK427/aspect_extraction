They have an excellent selection (the rolls with crab are really great)
Reasonably priced with very fresh sushi
Weekends can get crowded, but still highly recommended
This is my favorite sushi place in the city
The food is always fresh and the variety of sushi is amazing
Also, the plum wine is very good
Can't beat the Rolls and prices at this joint
Nothing bad at this place as far as I've tasted
They have very imaginative rolls for sure!
This is one of my favorite places!! Fresh fish, never a wait, interesting rolls and low prices!! the food is always good and the decor is really nice too
There is never a crowd here and I hope that fact doesn't cause the business to suffer
Whenever I'm in midtown I have West Side Sushi for lunch
the panini at this little italian sandwich shop are truly amazing
read the onion while you wait
I have gone to Sipan several times, but the last time it was an awful experience! We had a 9pm reservation for 6 people but arrived 15 minutes early
The host let us sit at our table and wait for the rest of the party but 5 minutes before 9 the host asked if we were sure it was for 6 and the waiter threatened they would take our table if the rest of our party didn't arrive before 9:15
It's understandable if everyone is late but they were on time at 9
They made us very uncomfortable to say the least and put a damper on the whole evening
I recommend the food but maybe get it to go!
Overall, the food was very good
the tamale appetizer was very good, and the pan-seared seabass with capers in tomato sauce was excellent, some of the best prepared bass I've had in a while
The downside was the service, which was exceedingly slow
While we were seated promptly (we had a 7:30 reservation afterall), my wife and I had a 7:30 reservation and only ordered the appetizer and main menu courses and the meal took just under 2 hours
We wanted to stay for dessert, but we feared it might take another hour to get it
excellent peruvian fare
the ceviches are to die for as well as the main seafood entrees
It is worth a trip uptown without a doubt
the best peruvian spot in nyc, hands down
i was stunned by the chef's handling of the delicate flavors of the different ceviches as well as by his updates on traditional dishes
be sure to order a tamale and clasico papas with your ceviches to start
fair warning - the kitchen's expertise lies in seafood dishes
main courses of duck and steak are hearty and delicious, but you wil be most impressed with your starters and seafood entrees
a word on the ambience - details! as a peruvian, i loved each charming (not cheesy) homage to peruvian culture
don't miss the nazca figures painted on the ceiling!
As a Peruvian, Sipan definitely excells in its Peruvian culinary skills
The appetizers a/k/a aperitivos were simply delicious and enough for two
Better yet, if you order several (4-5) aperitivos plus a soup, it's enough for a meal
My compliments to the Chef and staff
The decor is simply and elegant
Food is excellent and the atmosphere is cosy
The service is quite slow, but good
The Pico Sour's are great
Very good Peruvian food, prices that you'd consider reasonable
Creative and tasty
Great room too
Their small bar area is GREAT
There are so few good bars in the area, and nobody knows about their bar, which features a very cozy and cool couch area around a big table
Not a place for a bar crowd, but ideal for a group of 5-8 people
This is definitely an untapped UWS resource
Beautiful cozy dining area with great streetside views
The food is AMAZING and the service is fantastic
A good date spot and they can also accommodate larger groups as well as special events
Try their brunch on select Sundays!
I'm from the East Coast, what do I know about real mexican food
BUT I do know what i like, and I've only ever gotten one thing here, and it's still the best burrito I've ever had!! (Asada Beef Burrito)
I'm the type of person that likes my things made
I HATE places where they have all the condiments on the side, by the time I mix the sour cream, salsa and what nots into my burrito, it's cold and blah!!!! but they put a good mix of veggies, sour cream, and chunks of beef not the shredded kind
YUM
recommended!
One of the few Mexican restaurants in the city that's actually employed with Mexicans and not Chinese
=P Their food is pretty awesome and their gigantic Asada Burrito had a good balance of rice/ beans/ chicken (or beef)
There are cheaper options around the area, but you'll definitely get your money's worth
Delicious authentic Mexican food
Cheap like it oughta be, choices of black or pinto beans, lots of guacamole and jalapenos! Eat in the small, low-key, comfortable shop, or order to go
Pleasant service, daily specials and Mexican sodas and flan round out the bill
Absolutely worth every penny
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess
the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no reservations? then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people
we promptly left
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices
i will never go back
This is a great restaurant
Be careful when you go though, as it is a favorite for the opera fans and balletomanes
Reservations are sometimes a must
The bar area is a great place to sit instead of the dining room
Food is consistant and tasty, nice selections of wine by the glass, bartenders are friendly, servers and host are incredibly accomodating
I've been here about 8 times and always enjoy myself
In Short With friendly servers and goofy gimmicks, Chevys is a big draw for families and groups looking for a fun, affordable night out
A full bar and a dozen different margaritas attract a happy hour crowd, and a tortilla machine is often surrounded by children watching the dough-to-tortilla transformation
Fajitas, a house specialty, are available with nearly a dozen different fillings, from mesquite-grilled chicken to portobello mushrooms and asparagus
Desserts include flan and sopaipillas
This place is exactly what you would expect
Decent food, good prices and crazy decor
In terms of mexican chain restaurants I rather eat at On the Border any day, but Chevy's is ok
Seating was quick
Server came right over with chips(very good) and salsa
Answered questions and offered the evening specials and took our drink order
Drinks came quickly
then the food came
Goya from a can makes better refried beans
Sauces mild
Beef in taco overcooked
All in All
if I wanted to have Tex-Mex food again I'll wait till I go back Texas
Best advice for everybody
stay with the REAL MEXICAN(High-End) places in N
Y
and forget Tex-Mex
The food here is quite good and the lunch specials are hard to be beat
They offer different cuban food for each day of the week

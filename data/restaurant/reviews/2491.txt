Be careful with the sumo burger, it's HUGE
great burger
especially after a few beers
fries were a bit spicy but the burger taste more than made up for it
i was pleasantly surprised
1 of the best burgers in the city
The best greasy spoon in town
Big Nick's has a good variety of cheap (for the upper west side) diner-like food
The atmosphere of the little booths with all the signed pictures on the wall is classic as well as the limited outdoor seating
The best part: open 24 hours so it's a great place to stop on your way home from the bar strip just a few blocks away
The restaurant is very smokey, extremely small and dirty
The burgers were ok, the fries too spicy
You're better off going to McDonalds
Big Nicks is by far the best burger joint in the entire Northeast
I haven't been there in probably 4 years and nothing has even compared since then
BIG NICK can place any ANY toppings your heart desires on your burger, it also has the infamous SUMO burger, which is one pound of beef
I had a SUMO Burger once with carmarlized onions and mushrooms, muster cheese and all the trimmings, it was great, it also comes with a huge order of fries and a large drink
I could not finish it all, but my brother polished 2 OF THEM!!!!!
This place just can't be beat for the price! The burgers are top quality and available in sizes from 1/8 lb
to 1/2 pound (the Sumo)
The menu offers the greatest variety of food in relation to the size of the kitchen
A GREAT burger!!
This place has everything that anyone could ever want, except atmosphere
4am, just came from clubbing
want fat juicy burger
big nicks is open and ready to serve
great hamburgers!
Great burgers and fast delivery
If you ask, you can get waffle cut seasoned fries with your burger
Big Nick's is simply heaven
They have an amazing menu which never ends, charismatic and sweet waitstaff, and lots of charisma about it in general
It's the kind of place you'll never forget
Their burgers are *EXCELLENT*, perhaps even *DIVINE*
But not to be overlooked is their 100% vegetable soup, their garlic soup, their fantastic ceasar salad
for all of it's dive atmosphere, Big NIck's is really quite clean and friendly
You'll love it - I can almost guarrantee
-Ljova
Without a doubt one of the best burger's Ive ever had
This is my kind of place
You wont be sorry you went
The best Vanilla milkshake in the world! Not to forget that they also have incredibly good burgers!
This place is straight ahead
What you see is what you get and what you get is a pizza that is better than most and some of the best burgers around
Don't go there to impress your date with ambience
But if your best girl thinks thrift is sexy, Score! Also try Pizza Joint Too (another restaurant by Big Nick) on Columbus and 71st
the best
you have to get the bacon cheeseburger here
it's incredible
Every winter my husband and I go to New York for a weekend
We go shopping at Zabar's and the first place we go to is Big Nicks
They have the BEST Pizza that I have every had!!!! The joint has character, for such a small place what a great big menu!!!! Wish I lived closer, I would be there everyday!!!!
Get past the appearance of the place, dig into their HUGE menu, and enjoy! All the dishes are good, maybe not mind-blowing, but always good
Comfort food is the specialty, burgers and pizza are very very good
Try blueberry pancakes on a weekend
Where else can you get Jimmy Dean southern sausage and grits in NYC?
This place is authentic
It's a step back in time
The food is the best
Definately the Big Nick burger is the best in new york
I've been eating their pizza and burgers since I can remember, but I still haven't tried every single variety of pizza! Order or go sit and eat and I guarantee the food will be great
It's always so good, even if it is way into the night (they are open 24 hours)
Great Pizza to take out or eat quick
No atmosphere but the Pizza makes up for it
Great for a fast meal in the upper west side
I gave the waitress $60 on a $38 bill and asked for change
She brought me back change for $50
She said, There is so much money changing hands that I forgot how much you paid
There were only 8 customers in the entire restaurant! I figured you would tell me if you had paid $60 and I would just come back
Yeah, you figured you would grift me good because I wasn't paying attention
The food was ok
Garlic Bobs must have been taken over by Pronto Pizza
Apart from the darn boxes SAY 'Pronto Pizza', this place has slipped into a serious mediocre slump
Don't pay $25 for a large pizza that sells for $14 at Pizza Hut
PS- there's really NO true garlic item on the menu! I'm confused
Small place, fast service, good deal, pizza by the slice!
If you like greasy pizza with a very doughy crust, stop at T R Pizza
The Scene McAleer's stucco exterior may look almost scary at first sight, but inside is a surprisingly spacious, unthreatening watering hole that knows how to leave its customers alone
Those in search of rowdy times can go elsewhere; McAleer's is for those who know how to have fun with nothing but a friend, a beer, and a forgotten Pink Floyd song on the jukebox
The Food Don't expect great strokes of culinary innovation; McAleer's sticks to a time-tested formula of predictable pub grub
The offerings include chicken fingers, chilli, wings, burgers, steaks, fish and chips, shepherd's pie and more
Guinness, as one might expect, is ubiquitous
3 ladies lost in NYC had a great time Saturday night! Entertained by the banjo player (even without his banjo!)
Celebrated my birthday and was glad to be around friendly people
Great atmosphere, a real neighborhood spot
I hope to get back some time soon
Went here on St
Patrick's Day, and will never go back
Looking for the restroom, I was screamed at by a waitress to get out of her way, then told by another waitress to stop elbowing the waitresses?!? If this is how they treat all of their customers, I am surprised they get any business at all
This is one of the best bars ever
Great location, friendly staff and great decor
It really reminded me of a pub in Ireland
We had a private party there and the service and attention were remarkable
Overall just a great spot, low prices and good company
I would highly recommend!
Not a great place if you are looking for a scene and in all honesty, I got kind of bored sitting there even though I had good friends around
The bartenders aren't above usual and neither is the staff's service, especially if by the off chance it gets busy
I did like the food though
I'm used to going out to clubs and lounges downtown and I must say, sometimes, it's just a nice change
No velvet ropes, just a nice laid back place, no model-types behind the bar (well, if there were, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain
can't blame a guy for liking his eye candy right?), just friendly faces

The service was mediocre -- my waitress didn't know anything about oysters
To top it off, a 20% gratuity was added to a check for 5 people, which I thought to be improper, especially in light of the mediocre service
After years of walking by this place, we decided to have a late dinner
It was fantastic! Low key, great service, funny helpful waiter and so much fun
The food is not cheap but it was worth it
Our group spent a while but did not feel rushed like other places in the city
Will be going back for good food and good times again soon
My boyfriend and I went to City Crab on Valentines day and was VERY disappointed
I ordered the surf and turf - The filet mignon was SO small, cooked medium well though I ordered it rare
The lobster tail was very small too
The lobster was pretty tough from being overcooked, and it was cold
The lobster meat in the lobster risotto was fishy and salty tasting
I thought the price for that meal was absurd
There were no redeeming qualities to my meal or the atmostphere/service
However my boyfriend's meal (alaskan king crab legs) was excellent
I would have complained to the waiter, but I do not believe I had an opportunity, as he did not ask us how our meal was (however he did not forget to add 20% gratuity to our bill
)
I have been to city crab many times but recently they have been slipping
My most recent trip there will surely be my last
I went there over the MLK long weekend
Upon entering we were promptly seated and ordered a few minutes after ordering the waiter came out and said they are completely out of crab, crab legs, crab claws everything
OK this place is called city crab that might have been good information to give us at the door
He recommended everyone order twin lobster tails instead
after that he disappeared came back seemed shocked that we had not ordered yet
We ended up ordering a bunch of apetizers, everything except the oysters sucked including the service
This place obviously doesn't care about their clientele any longer
Name of the restaurant is city crab make sure you actually stock the kitchen with crab
This place is terrible
i was here for a gf's surprise birthday party
we were seated upstair in the dining room
it was nice to be away from the noisy crowd
majority of us been here before
it was my first experience at this place, and i enjoyed it
i will definitely come back here again for another b'day party or just my bf
My wife and I were on a long weekend vacation and had one thing in mind
We wanted Alaskan King Crab Legs
We found what we were looking for and even more
Our reservations were for 8:00 p
m
and we were immediately seated (even though we showed up about 15 minutes early) at a window table
The waitress was very attentive and a pleasure
The Cajun Popcorn Shrimp was not exactly spicy, but it was still very good
The Alaskan King Crab Legs were perfect
We both had the garlic mashed potatoes as a side dish and enjoyed it very much (with a generous portion)
I had the hot fudge brownie with ice cream and caramel for dessert
My wife had the New York Cheese Cake
Both of them were wonderful in presentation, portion, and especially taste
I most definitely recommend this place
I never miss going to City Crab when I come into the city
It is simply great seafood for a reasonable price
Sometimes the service is weak, but I've also had some of the best service
I've never had a bad meal
I think I'll go there tonight
We made an unplanned stop on a Wednesday night and had a pleasant dinner, seated in the upstairs balcony
We started with a Spicy Tuna Roll from the sushi bar, which was fresh, cold and nicely spicy
We both had the City Grilled Seafood combination, consisting of three Garlic Grileld Shrimp, 2 scallops and a crab cake
The shrimp and scallops were all cooked to perfection and the crabcake was nicely sauteed all crabmeat, no filler
The Jasmine Rice made a nice side
The cole slaw was outstanding, we consider it the best restaurant cole slaw we've ever had
For dessert we split a deliciously sweet peach-blueberry cobbler served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream
All in all it was a bit pricey, but a nice dinner
Of the thousands of restaurants in the city- this is one to skip
After waiting 20 minutes for a glass of water, and then another 10 minutes to order, my date and I chose from a prix fixe selection of 3 meals- going for the Soft Shelled Crab as our entree
We were dismayed to find out that a place called City Crab was completely out of Soft Shelled Crab
Worse, they were also out of the second meal choice- boring Chilean Sea Bass- leaving us with only 1 choice for entree- the even more boring Sole
Being forced to choose from City Crab's regularly overpriced fare, we told our waited we'd skip on the prix fixe
We were brought the appetizers from the prix fixe regardless (also lousy), and charged for them- Strrrike 3! Generic feel
Negligent service
Mediocre Food
Great place for seafood
I recommend the alaskan king crab legs in garlic butter
broiled lobster is always good and suprisingly tasty french fries
Only thing I didn't like was the uncomfortable high bar table seatings towards the front of the restaurant
Hard to get up on the stool if you're not tall enough and you're legs feel numb once you get down from stuffing yourself with a wonderful meal
From the waitstaff (who must think they are above everyone else on the planet) to the overrated food (lobster bisque/crabcakes - you name it), its just not worth the time nor the experience
The waitstaff is attitudinal and the food is experimental
Went to celebrate my sisters birthday on 9/11 was 1st taken back on the waiters rude answering of a question we had about the menu
2nd We waited a long period of time between our appetizer and entree
When asked if we wanted dessert and declined we were then given our check by having it tossed on the table and that was it
No thank you have a good evening NOTHING
The food was very good but the service made it now worth returning
Sunday night I went over to the Crab for dinner, pleasantly found a special  $1
00 blue point oyesters??? can you beat that washed them down with a cold beer   Thanks City Crab
I went to CC for restaurant week, and it was terrible
The appetizer took an hour to arrive and the waiters just plunked the entree dishes in front of us, even spilling some of the sauce
Food got to us lukewarm and looked really sloppy
We got the soft shell crab dishes and the three crabcakes
At the end, the check took forever to get to us because their machines weren't functioning
We sat upstairs and it was so loud and dank
We spent over 3 hours at this place and I do not recommend it at all
The service and food were way below average
It took at least 30 minutes to get someone to take our orders
We then waited over an hour (not an exaggeration) for our food to arrive
Everything was cold
My king crab legs were cold and dry
At least pretend to do some work and dip them in some boiling water or something! The raw oysters were not so great and the soft shell crabs were not fresh
Our water glasses weren't refilled unless we asked
The service was just horrible! For the price you're paying to eat there, I'd reccommend Lobster House on Kenmare Street in Chinatown
Turn around and go elsewhere!
Went for mother's day brunch

I could have used a little more variety but because they have the lounge area I was able to just hang out and talk while waiting for the next good song to come on
The drinks were really expensive though
The crowd did seem a little bridge and tunnel but again, I was with a great group so we just partied and noone bothered us
The atmosphere created by the neo-classic decor in Eugene is an exciting mix of elegance and class
The people watching is unbeatable! (Puffy seems like a regular, and one night I saw Michael Jordan there!) Plus, there is an amazing dining room and excellent lounge food! Highly recommend
Great decor, expensive drinks but worth the price, but the music is bland and the crowd is very cheezy
Great place to hang with a large group
but don't expect to meet anyone there
It was fun, but the service could definitely use some help
My question is, why were there so many cheesy-looking people there??
If you like overpriced drinks, poor bar service, and door staff that think they're better than everyone else, check this place out
Otherwise head elsewhere
The Scene Bearing a rustic look and a chalkboard full of specials, Le Pere Pinard (whose name means "Father Wine") attracts a number of expatriates conversing in French with the bartender and waitresses, as well as the kind of people who know how to sit at the bar and sip a cafe au lait or pinot noir with repose
The Food Along with a fine selection of wines, which extends to ports, champagnes and authentic variations like vin chaud (hot red wine flavored with orange and cinnamon), the dishes here are excellent all around
A beet soup special is bright and hearty, and the mussels, prepared with tomato, onion and bread crumbs, are a flavorful, buttery-soft delight
I went to this place last night at athe urging of a friend
Although a cute atmosphere, that's about all it had to offer
We got our entrees 50 minutes after ordering
They didn't clear our appetizer plates until before the entrees came (so we sat there w/dirty empty plates before us for like 1/2 hour)
I asked for my steak to be medium well, saying specifically that I wanted it pink inside
The thing was mooing
I didn't bother sending it back because it had taken so long just to get the thing in the first place
So, I spent $20 on a dish I barely ate
The service was HORRIBLE
My friends got their drinks about 15 minutes after ordering
Two of them got the drinks AFTER already finishing the entree
When we asked for the drinks, our waiter said Our bartender is busy
No apology, just an excuse
Anyway, when we left, we noticed one of the waitresses at the bar drinking wine
And she was definitely still on her shift
If you want subpar French food (there are WAY better French restaurants in NYC), poor service and a bad attitude, by all means, eat here
Otherwise, save your money
I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got! I've been several times and am totally smitten
The waiters are sweet, the food is tasty and the bill is never too large
It is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's NYC! They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?
Le Pere Pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding
Fresh, authentic, french cuisine in substantial portions
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world
Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $30
Not a small feat for good french food in the area
It's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out
Get there before 7pm
Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants
Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service
Bill a little high, but worth it
Would definitely visit again
Recommended
For people who like yummy food and big portions
They just got a new chef and the food is EXCELLENT
I keep coming back here for dinner and tried brunch the other week- really tasty and original
For people who like Bloody Marys this is a must! On the weekend its a great party place but I like to come here during the week nights
A nice neighborhood crowd, chilled out vibe
Great place for either appetizers and drinks at the bar, a romantic dinner or late night partying
Not many places like this left in the neighborhood
Two thumbs up
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace
The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed
The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value
It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area
Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response
Had a reservation for 3 friends on Sat
night
We were seated promptly by friendly host and place was packed
It was also at least 100 degrees in the restaurant (despite fact that it was 30 degrees outside) and even stripped down to tank tops, everyone was perspiring
Ridiculously bad ventilation
Our waitress was probably the rudest server I have had in 5 years in NYC
Goat cheese salad was the worst I've had and my salmon was so tasteless and dry that I didn't finish half of it
My friend's trout was equally poorly prepared
Our friend's steak was decent
With so many great places in the neighborhood we will definitely not be back
Too bad, b/c this place has potential if it wasn't for the poor service and food
This restaurant used to be good not long ago
I got engaged back in December and called them to make a last minute reservation
It became my worst nightmare
Of course, all the members of my group came as they could, since it was not organized
Every time each of my friends came, the host will give them a hard time
Plus he came to inform me that I needed to leave without finishing the wine
We did consume a lot
At least the host should have been polite
None of that
There are other places with better manners
The service at this restaurant is HORRIBLE
The restaurant business is a service industry and when a customer requests a drink, you make it
When I requested a drink, the bartender replied, make it simple, no college drinks
Well you know what, you're a bartender and you're job is to make me a drink whatever it may be
I was extremely offended and feel that this was completely unacceptable
I would not recommend this place to anyone, unless you feel like spending money to be treated poorly
I went here for a birthday dinner with my family we loved it despite that this is not a family restaurant
The food is excellent - interesting crowd of people
The bar was crowded but not obnoxiously loud
Seating is cramped and service could be better but is by no means a reason to not go
Kitchen is in the dining area so it gets very hot! The chocolate mini cake is excellent and so is their creme brulee, pates, shepherd's pie and multiple seafood entrees
As far as prices: 5 people (2 teenage boys included ) ate 5, appetizers, 5 entrees, 4 desserts, 1 bottle of wine, 4 beers and 5 coffees all for a little over $200 not including tip
Oh my God, it was so crowded when I went there last Friday
Definitely the place to be, mixed with all different kind of people
If you want to start some international friendship, you should go there
The early night looks more like a traditional restaurant, I am addicted to their basil mussels and their chocolate dessert which I forgot the name
Like a puffed pastry overfilled with dark liquid chocolate

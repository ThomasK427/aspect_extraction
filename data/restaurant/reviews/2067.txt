I live next door to Cowgirl, so thought it might be fun to try for a friend's birthday
Alas, we waited almost an hour to be seated (even with reservations) and the host actually recommended that we split our party between two tables to be seated more quickly! The staff were rude and inattentive, but I couldn't really blame them after having to deal with a glut of tourists and loud children all day
The food isn't necessarily awful, but there is nothing the chef does particularly well
The Mexican lacks flavor and the BBQ is dry
I was even disappointed in the Frito Pie, about which I've heard so much
It's been a while since I ate at Cowgirl
Mostly I sit at the bar, chat with my neighbors, and drink the 'ritas! When the munchies hit, I head straight for the Frito pie
It's a fun, funky place to spend an afternoon
Great music
I actually like the corny decor
Bartenders know what they are doing
This place is really nothing special
As one of our neighborhood restaurants, we're always amazed to see so many people eating there
I guess its all about location, which it has in spades
The food is boring and dry, and there's better homestyle cooking to be found within a few blocks in either direction
The service is typically awful and the atmosphere is purposefully tacky
The food is overly expensive and the menu doesn't branch out even a little from the traditional
The vegetables were overcooked and the desserts were dry
There's too many other great west village restaurants to try, so don't waste your time here
My husand and I ate there 05/01/05
Rita's were great
If you've ever been to Joe T Garcia's in Ft
Worth, TX
let me just say, these NY maragrita's are Joe T worthy! Service was horrible
But, hey, it was a beautiful day
good company and great drinks
We weren't in a hurry to get anywhere (which was a good thing)
If anything, stick to the basics
Quesadilla's and Frito Pie were really good
I had an OK experience at CowGirl, but I won't go back
Service was slow and our drink order took forever (and the place wasn't crowded)
Our waitress never seemed to be around when we needed her
I ordered one of the Spring Dinner Entrees, the Oyster Poboy
What a joke! For $15 I got a bun, not french bread and 4, yes, 4 fried oysters plus some sweet potato fries
While it was tasty, certainly not worth the price
I say SKIP IT!
please do yourself a favor and do not patronize this place
I was just there with a group of friends on 3/18/05
The food was barely mediocre, the drinks were nothing special, but what really kills this place is it's staff of cretinous cowpokes
they do not even bother feigning politeness or the ability to relate to other human beings
in fact, their impolitness bordered on hostility
there are many wonderful restaurants in that neighborhood
go to them and skip this horror show
I was told this was a great place to go to have fun so suggested it for a friends birthday
What a mistake
They have insane rules about everyone being there before they seat you and not letting ANYONE join after you've been seated, which is unrealist for large birthday/bachlorette groups
I could see if it was a very upscale place but there are pictures of cowgirls riding rabbits
The staff was downright horrible, at one point arguing back and speaking to everyone as if we were bothering them by patronizing the place
Margarita's were tasty but not very strong
Would not recommend it to my worst enemy, in fact will probably warn everyone within ear shot to never set foot in the place
Stay far, far away!
You know the type of restaurant that's perpetually crowded, but never by neighborhood locals? This is one
Never trust a restaurant that devotes more attention to its window displays than its dining experience
Be sure to join the throngs eating outside so you can catch the snickers of knowledgable locals wondering why you're paying $20 for hangar steak! There's really no excuse for eating at Cowgirl when you're within a 5 block radius of so many authentic, interesting and just plain great restaurants
This was my first time here and it definitely has a unique flavor
It has the loud, amiable atmosphere of a saloon, and the wait staff treats you as if you've been a regular for years
We went Sunday afternoon and still had to wait 20 minutes for a table (not much room in this restaurant so tables fill up quickly), but no worries! As we waited in the bar, we had Strawberry Margaritas in jars
I'd been warned about them but had no idea how much of a punch they pack! I'm glad I wasn't so loopy that I couldn't appreciate the chips and salsa (which consists of black-eyed peas! Yum!)
My sizeable bacon cheeseburger was juicy but overdone (I asked for medium and the bacon was too crispy for my taste), but otherwise, it was a great overall experience
I'm amazed I remembered it at all! :-)
You will be fighting the table for the delicious chicken nachos- they are great- and the chicken/beans/cheese/etc go all the way down- not just on the top layer of chips
You won't be able to finish them either- portions are huge
Good greasy grits in the Village- beware the bachelorette parties and LOUD 20 something b'days though
With a sweet, but clueless waitstaff, it is really the fun atmosphere and comfort-food menu that keeps diners returning to this west village classic, just off Christopher Street
The best thing served here is the legendary strawberry margarita, which is simply too good to miss
It is a bit hit or miss
If its after 10PM - don't bother
The food and service are both better when its busy
Once the rush is over, its all about closing up and gettin' home
Chicken fried chicken is still my favorite, but do order the gravy on the side unless you like your food swimming
My wonderful (conservative Yankee) parents were visiting from Boston, during the start of my fifth and final year at Columbia
Needed to take them somewhere new, since over the past four years we'd hit all the standards
Cowgirl was PERFECT
my parents were a bit intimidated, if not awe-struck, but Lisa and Dale got us seated as quickly as possible and were generally extremely kind, warm, and accomodating
Soon they were eating ribs and feelin' the country flava
: ) My parents are still raving about the food, which was delicious -- and now I can wear my Don't Mess With Texas shirt with even more pride
YAY COWGIRL! A+ all around!
Can we say average (or maybe below)
The bartender looked confused when we ordered wine
The service was slow and the ribs were way overcooked
They were Sahara Desert Dry
The atmosphere is really nice and if you don't mind waiting for a drink you might actually enjoy yourself
I used to love this place but the last time I ate here, two weeks ago, the servers were downright RUDE
They were obviously upset that we'd come for dinner at 10 pm (hello?! It was a Saturday night
and why even seat us, then?)) and they demanded we pay the check the minute they set the food down so they could check out
Then they started putting the chairs up on the tables, and asked if they could take their tip before we were even finished our dinner
I say they because no one person waited on us, they all took turns while they ate their own dinners
Just rude
Ok, as a Texan I know good BBQ
This was the pretty much the real deal
I had chili that was also great
Didn't catch up with me later either as my friends predicted with trepidation
OMG and our waiter looked like that guy from that band
I love this place
Good solid food, cheap, and a greta place to meet up with friends
The food is good and always consistent, the service is friendly just fine, and it never disappoints
If I'm not sure where to go for lunch or dinner, this place is my default!
I remember liking the Cowgirl---way back when
They've outlived the kitch
Poor service

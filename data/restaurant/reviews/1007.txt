Even though the place was almost empty it took a full hour to get our food which was cold, old was sent back
The explanation we got was that it took a long time because we melt our own butter (??!!)
Eating at Maras is like being held hostage for an hour then getting mugged on your way out
We resufed to pay for our uneaten brunch even as we were being yelled at on our way out
We wrote the owners of our experience but have yet to get a reply
I've been to Mara's twice now and will make many return trips
The BEST BBQ in NYC--great Mint juleps--delicious crabcakes, fried oysters, fried okra, gator bites crab fingers
This is not a fancy place--that's the whole point
The food is spectacular, the service is friendly, and it's always a really fun time
Take some good friends, have a Pampagne, kick back eat until you pop
This transplanted Southern girl has found her food home away from home
Thanks Mara!
We were seated shoulder to shoulder with people at a line of tables so close that I felt I was on the subway at rush hour, even though the other half of the place was empty
We waited 40 minutes to get our fried pickles and hush puppies (which never came but appeared on our bill anyway)
15 minutes later we were given our main courses
We both had Jambalaya, which tasted liked heavily-spiced cardboard
We barely touched it and told our waitress we didn't like it, and she explained to us that this was Cajun style Jambalaya and we probably had a different kind before
Needless to say, the bill was about 70 dollars, way overpriced for only eating an order of fried pickles and drinking two very powerul Hurricanes which tasted a little like Robitussin but made us drunk enough to almost forget our experience at Mara's
Almost
Went for Fat Tuesday last night - what a mistake! We wanted catfish and they were out
They were serving flounder instead
I ordered the sampler platter which had bland red beans and rice, dry and flavorless jambalaya, and an interesting variation on shrimp creole, the best thing we had from this place
My poor husband ordered a bowl of the jambalaya, it was so dry and tasteless he sent it back for the shrimp creole
By then Mara and her one waitress had snubbed our table, we had to wait forever for the check, then after waiting 10 minutes (literally) we had to get up and walk the check to the waitress so we could get out of there as quickly as possible
The sole reason I would return is for the potent Hurricane
I guess she figures if you get people drunk enough they'll eat anything
apparently she's right
Discovered Mara's last year for my birthday and have continued to go there for brunch often
We had dinner there last night and it was wonderful
Mara greeted us warmly as she usually does and we had a great dinner
I had the incredibly tender and tasty brisket while my husband had the catfish new orleans
It was very good (though we were hoping to try the crab cakes, but they were out by the time we got there) as was the bananas foster for dessert
Overall, we love Mara's and hope she brings back the brunch!
Went there for New Years Dinner with some friends
We had to wait 20 minutes outside in the cold for our table then over 1 hour for our entree
We were there for over 3 hours and missed celebrating the New Year b/c the owners never told us what time it was
I paid $20 for the stuffed flounder that was no bigger than an egg
The wait staff is horrible
We ordered the appetizer special and they told us they burned it so we couldnt have it
Then they burned my friends fried chicken and she finally got her meal 30 minutes after everyone was finished eating
The food was okay but the service and atmosphere was horrible and the food is way overpriced! The owners choose to make out every 10 minutes instead of making sure their customers are happy
We've been looking for cajun food all over the city that got it right in all the important ways
food, ambiance, service, personality, food (yes, it deserves it twice
most important thing), and vision
Mara her staff have done their homework in every single way, and it shows
Don't go anywhere else on that 'usual list' of cajun/New Orleans places
go here first and you'll never go anywhere else again
Upon entering this dark gloomy restaurant the wife was not welcoming and endearing
We were initially seated by the door where a big draft was coming in
Then seated in the back by the restroom
Weird because the restaraunt was empty so we should have been seated where we requested
The food was not good at all
Tastesless and the presentation was horrible it looked like a home economics project
They did try to push the hurricane drink which was very strong but better than the food
If you ever go there do not try the unsalted mashed potatoes or unseasoned chicken fried steak
Oh and the atmosphere is cold and dank! Waste of money and time I could have gone to BBQ's
The waiter tried his best even though he knew he was serving us slop
For the price, we expected much tastier food and were really disappointed
There are so many other nyc bbq restaurants for the same price that are ten times more delicious
All the food was extremely dry and bland
If they are priding themselves on comfort and hospitality they need to hire more help and do a serious overhaul of the interior
I understand some places don't need it, but don't just throw a few beads up on the wall and call it atmosphere
While we were dining there with some friends, we almost felt bad to bother one of the 2 owners/waiters, because they were absolutely stressed and had no idea what they were doing
Took my fiancee, her mother, and fiancee's best friend to this fine establishment for dinner
We had a blast! Food is great
We disagree with the comments about the Catfish
it was superb
Try the Po'Boys, beignets, and the Bananas Foster
If you're game, have the Hurricane drink
You'll feel quite alright after that
My boyfried and I went to this place, only to be disappointed by the clustered seating arrangement and the subpar food
Overpriced and underenjoyed
Not recommended
If I could eat this kind of food when I went home, I would still be living there
Mara, aside from being extremely cordial, simply makes the best BBQ in New York City that I have tasted, and I have been to just about every place New York has to offer
She and her husband actually care that you enjoy your experience not just pay your check
The recommendations that were made were dead on, although the truth is, everything my friends and I ate was great
All that was left after two appetizers and three main courses were a pile of rib and chicken bones without an iota of meat on them
Go here
and make sure to order dessert
As a native New Orleanian, I can honestly say that Mara's does it right
From the Abita beer to the crawfish monica, it's like Jazz Fest food in the East Village
The hometown atmosphere and friendly owners are welcoming every time we come in--Southern hospitality at its best
And the food
Mara's process to create the authentic recipes is trial and error until the taste is precisely right
She and David, her husband and co-owner, fly oysters and live Louisiana crawfish up several times/week to ensure true NO flavor
The results are staples like boiled crawfish, po-boys, jambalaya and gumbo that could have pleased customers in uptown New Orleans
Every time I bring a fellow New Orleans transplant in, they leave the place planning their next dinner back
If you're searching for the true New Orleans experience, look no further
For me, it's like sitting in my mother's kitchen back home
Met a friend here for dinner one night
The smell when you first walk in could literally blow you right back out the door - I have never been in a seafood restaurant that smelled so horrible! The food was okay - nothing to send people running to
The service was adequate, the drinks were fine
The prices were not bad so to that extent I can't complain
Would I make the effort to go back, no
Would I recommend this place to people, more than likely not, but they have been around this long so they obviously have a base that can sustain them
All this husband wife couple did was push us on the hurricane drinks which seems to be only fruit punch
The food was lousy, and service was horrible
It seems to me the only thing these guys know how to do is market their name
Save yourself the money and time

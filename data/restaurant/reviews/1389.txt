I stated if you can get us out, we'll be out, but thought it was rude to call back and ask to change the time
Needless to say, they were unable to get us out due to poor service
The space is pretty but like America its predacessor it's too large for the kitchen
I agree with the other review, the food and the service is not as good as the other locations
Welcome downtown
we were thrilled when we heard Rosa Mexicano was coming downtown and we were not disappointed in the beautiful space on 18th street, the food and drinks are delicious, especially the duck appetizer, the shortribs and the hibiscus margarita
Muey sabroso! The service is truly friendly and they treated our kids like people, unusual in NYC
we will be back again and again
The Rosa Mexicano at Union Square should be avoided at all costs
The quality of the food is significantly lower than that of the two locations
I was at the restaurant a week ago and the waitress gave my credit card to a different customer (the customer ran off with my card)
The restaurant management had no idea as to how to solve the situation and the low quality of the restaurant's service became extreamly apparent
If you feel like mexican food you should try out a different restaurant
I walked into this restaurant and was immediately impressed by the decor
It is the best looking of all the Rosa Mexicano locations in NYC
The sangria at $28 a pitcher was a great bargain and tasted awesome
The guacamole was delicious, but the portion was extremely small and mild even though I asked for spicy
I didn't like the tuna shrimp ceviche, but when I sent it back, the manager immediately came over and offered me and my friend an order of guacamole on the house, which we graciously accepted
My friend and I ordered several items from the menu, but I found them to be very disappointing
If you're looking for great Mexican food, don't come to Rosa Mexicano
The only thing good here are the drinks
Stopped by with some business associates
The food was excellent, service was great and very friendly
Loved the atmosphere inside and out
The drinks were unique and really good
This place is a well kept secret (for now anyway)
I would highly recommend
We had such a wonderful time at Royal's
The environment is lovely with a beautiful bar and a gorgeous fireplace
Every bite of food was special, filled with amazing, unexpected flavor
We raved about every course
The service was wonderful, with a very sweet and attentive waiter
There weren't many people there though
Clearly it hasn't caught on that the best meal in Brooklyn can be found in Carroll Gardens just a few blocks off the F train
It's the best meal you'll get outside of Manhattan, and in fact better than most you'll find in Manhattan
Really sweet place
Everything we had was delicious from the dip for the bread to the desserts - a trio of creme brulee
Sirloin so tender it could have been filet mignon - it melts in your mouth, and there were a lot of other tempting options on the menu
Great service and ambiance
And for some reason (maybe because it was a holiday weekend) there was nobody else there the entire time we were eating, and we didn't rush our dinner
We will definitely go back there
Royal's is definitely a great place to eat and relax
I've been there three times and the food has been excellent on each occasion
The portions are very generous, which is unusual in other restaurants of this caliber
I like the fact that the menu changes often - the chef uses seasonal ingredients, so everything is fresh
The staff is attentive without being annoying
Good wine list too
They can accommodate big groups, but it's also nice for two
We love it, what a wonderful addition to a wonderful neighborhood
Go there at least once a week with my husband and our son (he is almost two)
Everybody is so friendly and totally accomodating
Great food, great wine and the atmosphere is great, enjoy!
This is one more Brooklyn restaurant that will have Manhattanites taking the often dreaded trip over a bridge for food
I went with a group of friends and was therefore able to try a little bit of everything
The fondutti is remarkable and memorable
The steak is the best I have ever had
(quoted from friend) I had the fish and happily savored each bite  THe food is quite a treat and something you would not be disappointed with if you had it at a well known top-rated restaurant


Ambience is warm

complete with red walls, fireplace, candles

not stuffy
This place is a total find
Really nice looking, especially with french doors on the street side opening onto a dining balcony
With candles all over the dining room (which is a deep red color with a nice bar), it's a great date spot
And the food is seriously good
I had crabcakes (delicious) and a wonderful pasta dish
The waiter told me the chef worked at Craft in Manhattan
It's a little pricey for some of the dishes, but I would recommend this place as a great new restuarant to try if you're looking for a nicer dining experience
#1 - Batali Bastianich (Lydia and Joe) are food idols of mine
#2 - Babbo is my favorite restaurant in NYC - food, service and decor are unparallel - it's just a perfect restaurant
This was my 2nd trip to Del Posto
The first time I sat in the main room and had an average meal
This time I sat in the lounge and had a below-average meal
I called (from in from of Babbo, which was packed) and asked if they could acomodate 2 people at 9:45
they said yes, but it was as if they were doing me a big favor
I also asked if jackets were required for men - I was wearing a dress shirt, pants and shoes, but no jacket
They said it was preferred but not required
We drove over and parked out front
We went inside to the lounge and found that there were several empty tables (which never ended up being occupied)
Also, may of the men were wearing jeans
Many people were also yelling loud and one guy was using profanities
I can't imagine that this is the vision that Batali the Bastianich family had for DP
As for the food, which at the end of the day can help me forget everythign else, was very mediocre
My tuna carpachio was a very nice start and my wife enjoyed her salumi platter
I also appreciated the creamed lardo spread for the bread
The pasta was very dissapointing - which was a shock and very saddening
My wife had a bland gnocchi with sausage and I had squash blossom stuffed ravioli that was drowning in butter sauce
My skirt steak entree was a little better but her lamb wasn't very tasty - again, boring
Dessert was Ok - a nice, moist almond tart for her and a dry, traditional fruit cake-like dessert
Throughout the whole process my server acted as if he had just had a lobotomy
Everywhere I looked, something just seemed off
Overall, overpriced and underwhelming
It hurts me to write this but I had to get it off my chest
This is our 2nd visit to Del Posto
My 1st review was in the lounge, which we fully enjoyed
The piano bar is beautiful and the bartenders make amazing cocktails, and the wine list is excellent
Last night we walked in w/out a reservation, and they were so nice at the desk

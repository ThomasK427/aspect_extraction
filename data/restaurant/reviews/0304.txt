Such a shame
and the vibe
I had the Mole and a really cute waitress
Scene is a good one
I really dont know why everyone seems to be so nege about this place
kick back and relax!
La POOPlapa is a more fitting name
Don't bother with this place
This place was a huge disappointment
Starting off with having to pay for chips n salsa (isn't this against Mexican restaurant tradition??) the food was very, very spicy
This is good if you like spicy food, but it was just too much
I even like spicy food but this one was too rough on my stomach
It had a lot of fancy Mexican dishes (those of you looking for the basics, go elsewhere) and it was super loud, hence not very romantic
All in all, it is a great place to go if you like VERY spicy food and you have a large group
Otherwise, I would try a different restaurant
Cheers
All of you people who think that La Palapa is overpriced and not authentic are insane!!!!! They have the best Mexican food I have ever had, full of delicious unique flavors
And everything tastes so fresh! The staff is so friendly and knowledgable, and the owners are so personable, and often come to your table to give you tastes of dishes
Those of you who think it's too expensive: what's so espensive about $5 for a quesadilla, or $12 for an entire brunch
As for small portions, yes, a couple of the appetizers may be small, but I dare anyone to order the chiles rellenos, and tell me that it is a small dish
The ambience is also wonderful - I love the lit wall in the back
I frequent this restaurant, and everyone else should too!
upbeat mood and music
I was happy to see the table salsas were like the ones I had in Mexico and really loved the tacos and quesadillas
We tried the Hibiscus Margarita recommended by another ctitsearch reviewer and wow was it great or what!!!?
This place has a super fancy exterior---too bad the food quality doesn't match the decor's quality
The food is bland, served in small portions, and is overpriced
Only someone who likes to be ripped would love this place
For all its glitz and glam, it still serves some of the worst Mexican in NY
And their service is super slow!
Great place! The atmosphere is inviting and the waitstaff attentive and knowledgeable
The menu is original with something for everyone--including cheese that is made on the premises
And for the drunken horticulturist in all of us, there's a hibiscus margarita that will keep you planted at the bar for hours
Why oh why do people love this place
The food is downright yucky sometimes and occassionally decent
Overpriced
The tacos were dry and bland
The enchiladas were a big indecipherable mass
Cocktails are good and will at least keep your spirits up (until you get the bill)
Service is OK
I have been to La Palapa countless times and each time I go, I cannnot bring myself to order anything but the delicious duck mole
It is the best mole dish I have ever had
And this is coming from a proud Mexican who, until now, would scoff at the pretense of creative, unconventional Mexican dishes
The well-concocted spices are expertly paired with simple sides of saffron rice and spinach
My string of dinner companions have also raved about the steak with lime and the chicken tacos
Stay away from the enchiladas
It is the only dish that hasn't received a stellar review from one of my recruits
The service here is always friendly
Their attentiveness leaves a bit to be desired, but the bright and cheerful atmosphere makes it impossible for you to care
Especially if you've had a pitcher of the delicious white sangria ;)
So what? Its not like an extra few bucks is going to kill you, relax! If charging for chips is what it takes to keep that place consistantly good, I'm all for it
I love it every time I go there
Real mexican (not taco bell/maryanne's style tex mex), good marg's, service is ALWAYS polite, and the atmosphere is fun
I finally branched out from my standard order of the skirt steak with lime, and was not disappointed
Great place
If you can't afford chips, go to burritoville
the ambiance is tres cool
kind of lounge-like
not at all pretentious
low lights
funky mexican music
excellent decor
apparently, the place as been feng shuid to the hilt! the food is incredible
if you love margeritas---it's totally worth sampling one here
they use fresh squeezed lime juice---as opposed to bottled---and the taste is evident
also, the quacamole is to die for
it is soooo genuine
i always order two heaping plates of it!!!! and one last thing
the chips are different
they are spiced chips, not just plain chips
and i assure you, they are yummy chips! a most satifying meal awaits you at la palapa
lousy:  first we were seated in the garden right up against the super loud air conditioner
so we asked to be moved back inside-- so far, so good
(during our dinner, it appeared that another couple encountered this and also asked to be relocated
)  then we got the infamous try and taste me dishes -- we paid for chips to discover they were mostly flavorless except the overspiced salsa
we both practically choked on the spicy salsa
my frozen margarita was undrinkable -- sour and weak
the enchilladas were some crappy pieces of chicken wrapped in a tortilla with the same sauces we already got for free and some flavorless cheese
the chicken with plantains: well, the plantains were good
the chicken was (see enchilladas above)
go somewhere else like any mexican place below 14th street for better food
(oh, the service was excellent, otherwise!)
For the theatre crowd - fast service, reasonably priced, good Chinese food
Recommended
This place is the tourist fav of chinese food in the city, the service was fast, but the taste of the food is average, too much starch used in dishes, and the flavors of different dishes are very similar, can't really tell the difference
the place is crowded and LOUD, but the food is very good
they have various buns, which you can't find at most fast food joints and great authentic noodle soups
I usually am a Chinese food snob -- no chain restaurants, but truly, the food here is delicious!  The ol' standby General Zhou's is awesome, and the sauteed string beans are to die for!
Scallion Pancakes
Their Spare Ribs are delicious, they are short little 2-inch ribs, but they are truly unique in that they taste as if they were marinated/basted in wine
Just delicious
I've eaten at Chinese Restaurants all over NYC my whole life (I grew up here) yet Ollie's is the first (the ONLY) that serves Spare Ribs that taste like this
And their Scallion Pancake with dipping sauce is INCREDIBLY delicious
Good texture to it too
Not too crispy/crunch and not soft either
Scallion Pancake Perfection
Oh, and their other dishes/meals are good too
Quite good
we celebrate my friend's birthday at Ollie's, food was ok but service was really really bad
you would never imagine!!! our waiter wasn't friendly at all

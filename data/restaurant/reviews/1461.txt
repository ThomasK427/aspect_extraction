Try the cajun ribeye and the macaroni and cheese
Very resonably priced for midtown Manhattan
I will definitely go back
The atmosphere is great, more elegant than most of the places in the hood
Drinks were made by someone who clearly respects the cocktail and what people look for in a cocktail and the burger, damn smart chef, is not only voluptuous but also served on an english muffin
Next time I go I'm trying the escargot for sure because the table next to me wouldnt share
(Okay, I didnt actually ask
) Anyway, I've lived in the 'hood since the nineties and it pains me when places move in that suck, but I'm content with this new option and sort of wondering why I'm writing this review now because it wasnt very crowded when I went
Ah, you'll find it anyway so why bother keeping it secret
Being french, I am always surprised on how french bistros are successfull in New York, because if you've been around in Paris a bit, they're nothing like bistros in Paris
But I have to say it the formula works, Pastis, Schiller
So Casanis is trying ti repeat the same formula
Same trying to be french bistro decor, floor, table, menu cards
Overall, it's mixed
Excellent steak au poivre, steak tartare eatable but doesn't taste at all like a steak tartare you would eat in France, same for the escargots
The kitchen is small and you have to wait a long time to be served
So it looks french but it's not
It just doesn't taste like one
I would not recommend
This is New York, there is a million restaurants to choose from, why bother ?
last night was my first night at casanis,really outstanding restaurant from the service to the food
As a lover of french food and wine i was very pleased
Great tuna tatare and i highly recommend steak
Check out there wine list to,overall casanis is my new favorite restaurant on the les
I not only went there for dinner on Friday night, but Casanis is so good that I had to go back for Sunday brunch
Finally a place in the Lower East side (not on clinton street) that has lovely food to match a lovely atmosphere
As a local I hope this place continues to excel, but only enough so that I can always get a table
From the oysters to the burger this place rocks!
When I first saw Casanis I thought to myself what a bright place in an otherwise dark corner
I went inside and felt I had come home
An amazing find in the lower east side that, up till now, has lacked great restaurants at affordable price
Forget Clinton Street and their overprice decor and menu, Casanis has great ambiance, great food and great prices
The decor is beautiful (check out that bar!!!)
The owner, Mukta, put the beautiful floor down himself and he did a magnificent job
I live in the neighborhood and having Casanis here has just increased the value of my co-op
I always say trying is believing, so try Casanis and you decide for yourself
By the way, the service is excellent
This new french restaurant has the most amazing food
Everything about the place- from the decor, the table, the bar
even the bartender feels authentically French
The ambiance is great- laid back, trendy and relaxed
I highly recommend this place- I've been there twice already
I've been here a few times since they opened, and I prefer it over alot of the restaurants on Vernon Bvd
It isn't crowded or obnoxiously busy
The food is pretty good, and they've got a good beer selection
Service is pretty quick even when they get a little busy and the waitresses are always nice
I have been to Masso a few times and everytime i go i always enjoy myself
The food is awsome and the service is pretty good
The place is a great addition to lic
Weekend brunch is great as well
I first went to yuva when it had just opened about five months ago, we had a feast with the real indian flavours at yuva alongwith freindly service gracious owners
The place has the best indian food in the country, believe me when i say that, the service is so warm, its a pleasure to be at yuva
In last five months, whenever we wanted Indian meal
we were at yuva
Its funny the other evening my husband I were at this high end japanese restaurant for dinner I suddenly had a craving for yuva's food we actually left the table at japanese restaurant to dine at yuva
Being so regular there, we know everyone from yuva now, In fact, the owners wife is quite a celebrity in India, soap actrees model, with big fan following back home, but if you meet her in person, inspite of being so talented gifted, she is so grounded simple
Everytime we go, chef Ram (Bukhara fame) comes to talk to us, even makes something special off the menu for us
They all treat customers like one would treat guests in India, with care, love and warmth, which is unheard of in commercial establishments
They are truely a terrific team
God bless them
I just love food, service, music, atmosphere everything about yuva
Its like going back home to true Indian flavours true Indian hospitality
We highly recommend it
I've eaten at this restaurant 2 or 3 times now and I must say that the service ruins the experience every time
The food is average as other reviewers have stated, but it's hard to enjoy it when the staff is so consistently rude and brusque
I brought a few friends there last week, and now I will never go back
The server rolled his eyes when we ordered only an entree per person (with no appetizers), spoke curtly to us, and ignored our requests for more water etc
-- it was extremely embarrassing
Overall, I would not recommend this place
4 restaurants on same block, go some where else
My husband and I stopped in for lunch on the recommendation of a shop owner a few doors away
I had the buffet (which normally I would not choose) and my husband ordered off the menu
It was a splendid opportunity to try many different things I would not normally risk ordering
The service was prompt and friendly
They brought fresh naan to the table as well as a kind of crepe filled with potatoes that was cooked on a griddle set up by the window
I had always wondered what a tandoor oven looked like and the chef invited me back to the kitchen to show me how he makes naan and the kebabs
It was a delightful experience
The buffet was only $14 for a vast variety of tastes
I don't know the names of everything but there were fried lentil dumplings, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, carrot pudding, mango mousse, fish in a coconut sauce, lemon rice, little popovers that you punctured and poured in a seasoned broth, spinach and apple salad with mango dressing and numerous sauces
I highly recommend Yuva and will definitely return
Good decor, bad food, rude service I will never go this place nor I will recommend it to any one including my sworn enemy if I have one
Yuva is the perfect place to eat if you're extremely hungry for top notch food
The service was fantastic
When you walk in, everyone greets you graciously with smiles on their faces
They are extremely attentive and are happy to help
It has a wonderful atmosphere, including great music, pretty decorations, and confortable seats
There is a wide variety of tasty sounding dishes, and the food is plentiful and delicious
I suggest you try it and find out for yourself how fun and filling Yuva is!
This is truely a unique restaurant, it has that perfect combination that rare to get, splendid food, impeccable service great ambiance
I cant stop raving about it, because, in my entire life, I have never had such an experience in any Indian restaurant I grew up in the city
All I can say is this place is truely magical way above the rest hands down
i've been planning on going to this place for sometime now
the only thing i regret about my visit was the fact that i didn't go sooner
i've eaten at many indian restaurants, some very good
Yuva is by far in this league
i can't begin to explain how good their kebabs are, the lamb chops are a must
i met the owners and the chef who were very hospitable i can honestly say i've made new friends
Its so funny but this street has a few Indian restaurants that serve Indian food, and yes we' ve been to each, at least once
But always felt the need of an upgrade in Indian restaurant set up
but in vain

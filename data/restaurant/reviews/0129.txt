I recommend the duck appetizer with the lamb shank as an entre
Their drinks are decent as well, but not as reasonably priced as one might want
I loved this place
I had the Halibut which was a customer-favorite and it was so good I ate it all without having the thought of offering my friends to try
Nuff said
The Sangria was wonderful and I accidentally knowcked over my (empty) glass as I was putting on my coat to leave and they were so nice about it and didn't make a big deal
The staff here is very professional and courteous and they helped my friends make a decision about what to order
I don't consider this authentic Mex
probably a mex-american fusion but it is excellent!
I'm sure I'm setting myself up for a future disappointment by saying this, but Hell's Kitchen always delivers, every time
The drinks are great, the good is great, and though I read in the Citysearch review that the service can be slow, I've never experienced that
In my numerous trips there, the host or hostess has always kept us up to date on when we can expect our table
HK has quickly become the default restaurant for us, and the place we like take out of town guests staying in midtown
Highest recommendations
The food here is always excellent ! And the servers very nice and helpful
It gets pretty packed every night, so I would recommend reservations
Definitely get the Tuna Tostadas for an appetizer any special they have with duck ! The chips black bean sauce they have on every table are to die for
They are warm slightly sweet, half bread half chip they are addicting ! Also the pan seared chilean sea bass, it comes with grilled chayote a plantain puree that is so good you will want to come back the next day and have it again
I have been here many many times and evey experience has been wonderful
This place is wonderful! I went to Hell's Kitchen today for lunch with 7 colleagues, and left extremely satisfied! The waitress and waiter were extremely attentive and fun! Their portions of food were large, and the festive decor was simple, understated, yet impactful! I love the fact that they give cornbread and bean dip as an appetizer! And the tuna tostadas were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G
I would definitely go back again! Great margaritas, great time, great place
I bring my friends to Hell's Kitchen all the time, and after waiting forever for a table, they all love it
The steak last night was very well-spiced and perfectly cooked, and the seafood is consistantly good
It's far better than what usually passes as Mexican
We've also downed more than our share of margaritas; I especially like mango
The big con is waiting for a table, since there are no reservations after 7
It's fine for a group of 2, but hell (pun intended) if you're more than 4
Coming late is fine, as tables are usually available after 10PM
I have worked in hotels, bars, restaurants my whole life even owned my own
Reagarding this establishment -- menu looks great, decor colorful lively, it all stops there
First try -- gave name for a dinner table, went to the bar, the bartender, and I've bartended in faster paced establishments, pointed at me as I began to ask what kind of flavored vodka they serve, obviously too much for him and he moved on to the next parton
Passed the host stand and explained that they should not hold a table for me due to rude bartender
Thinking I would give it another chance, called for reservation -- how the hell was I to know they only accept reservations from 5-7pm ONLY
I was made to feel like a looser that I did not know this
I did not know -- and will never care
Despite having 3, yes 3, glasses of water dumped on me by the waiter and the lack of response by managment, I really enjoyed the key lime martinis and the food was excellent
Just make sure not to sit with your back to the bar and all should be ok!   I went with a group of 10 and besides the water, the service was fine if a little slow
I like this place: The food is always good, the frozen margaritas are awesome, and the service staff is usually good
My only complaint is that I was there on two separate times at just after 5pm and thirsty for a drink, but they weren't open yet
They should open earlier!
Hell's Kitchen has consistantly been the best restaurant experience I have ever had in New York
I've been there many times, and I have never been disappointed by any facet of this restaurant
Food: amazing
Service: perfect
Ambience: perfectly suited for the space and versitile enough for a first date or large party
And killer margaritas!
My friends and I went here and had a wonderful experience
The service was incredibly attentive and accomodating
Food was excellent
I'll definitely return!
Among NYC restaurants that gussy up Mexican food for Gringo foodies, Hell's Kitchen is among the best
Offering less expensive, better food and drink than Rosa Mexicana and a modicum of comfort and courtesy missing at Mexicana Mama, Hell's Kitchen is worth a little trek
Staff was unfailingly accomodating and polite
Chef has a rare deft hand with the deep frier as evidenced in the pita-like toasts offered gratis (instead of the usual crisp tortillas) with an excellent black bean dip, the surprisingly delicate duck empanada on red mole, and the banana pastry for dessert
Excellent balance of textures and flavors in my red snapper on a bed of plantains, onions and tomato, all in banana leaf - fine attention to detail in the prep
Paired wines were excellent
Restaurant would earn a 9 were the noise lessened and the tables more generously spaced
In sum: good show!
Can I say good food, friendly service and a relaxed atmosphere all in one! No reservations were required, however the small space means you most likely will need to wait a bit
Margaritas need some help - may be the cheap tequila
The food is hot, hot, hot to trott if that's what you like
However, will aim to please on the spice scale
Prices definitely match the quantity and quality of the food
Recommend eating at the bar for an intimate, relaxed dinner
i used to be a fan of this place-the service was consistently slow, but the food outweighed the service
as of late though(maybe change of ownership)the food quality dropped with the menu change and the service got worse
when they brought the wrong dish (their mistake), they insisted that i pay for it-giving me a lecture at restaurants, u order, u pay with an attitude
what was worse, HE was the manager! probably the worse restaurant experience in nyc
Food here was generally ok
considering the insanely long wait to get a table
Not that the place is overly packed, just that the restaurant manager/greeter wouldn't sit people in a timely or organized manner
There were empty tables, but somehow the maitre d kept on disappearing for long periods while people waited
only to turn up and tell waiting guests that they can't be seated yet
Other than that, the lamb shank I got was pretty good, nothing spectacular, but definitely tasty
Too bad the evening was ruined by the clueless management of guests upfront
To be fair, our waitress was efficient and cheery and tried to soothe things for us, but it does sound like our experience is not uncommon
Avoid unless you and your guests like to be annoyed
The food was creative
The service was ok, all in all an average restaurant with above average prices
I now know why friends have panned this place so often
To start with, the maitre'd has the most condescending and arrogant attitude towards patrons
Within an hour I witnessed him being confronted by no less than 4 different parties for his inept seat allocation and long wait
The food is decent and table service a hit-or-miss in the 3 times I've been there
Not worth the hassle
9th Avenue has too many other awesome restaurants with better food and service for this pretentious joint to be on anyone's list of places to eat at
The food is fresh, inventive and fun
The place and location are no frills
The staff have been known to be a bit abrasive in trying to rush you out by leaning over and taking your plate or asking you multiple times if you're done when you're in the middle of a conversation
However, it is the food that will bring me back and I hope the last occasion of bad service will be my last
Excellent restaurant, appetizers and all four of our dishes were tasty and inventive
Lots of flavor but not too heavy
The shrimp with plantains was the table favorite
The place is fairly small so you can't find a private table, but it didn't feel overly crowded
It has modern earthtone decor with low warm lighting
They don't take reservations after 7:00 during the week so we had to wait for around 15 minutes
The crowd is young, I took my parents and I think they were the only customers over 35 years old
Four people with wine and appetizers came to about $150 with tip
Really yummy food at a fair price
Had dinner pre-theatre on saturday
Got me out just on time

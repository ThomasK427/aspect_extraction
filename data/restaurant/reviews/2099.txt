I recently hosted a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend's 30th at this restaurant and the food and service was great! I liked how they printed a personalized Happy Birthday message for my boyfriend on each menu since they print out their menus everyday
I had their crab cakes and they were very good
I had a group of 20 and they accomodated us very well although they're not that big of a place
The only downside is that they charge you $2 per person if you bring a cake of your own
Overall I recommend this place!
The Sazerac cocktail is strong and delicious
The crab cakes were actually delicious (and they almost never are) with a hot, spicy sauce
The service is compassionate
We went with a party of 8 (we made reservations that day) and were seated in our own little area in the covered patio by the door, it was perfect
The service was a little overextended and had a bit of an attitude, but it didn't take away from the great food and atmosphere
Their signature drink, the Sazerac, wasn't that good, but everyone enjoyed the suggested wine
I would also recommend the crabcakes
and the chocolate cake!
Saw this place on the internet; needed a place to host an eclectic group of friends, eight of us all told
Made reservations the day of, a few hours in advance, and they handled everything with aplomb, even though there were two even larger parties there that night and I overheard people being essentially turned away with the line of sorry, 45 minutes to an hour, but they never rushed us, but were always within reach when we needed our next bottle of wine
And the food was a general hit, maybe not quite as good as you'll find in some of hte gourmet houses of N'Awlins but some dishes were outstanding (the calamari diping sauce was the bomb) and the rest were all pretty good, as good a cajun/southern foodie meal as you'll find in the city
I've only been to Sezerac for brunch
Even at noon on a Sunday we were crammed next to other diners
After an amazingly stong and spicy bloody mary, I began to relax
Decent eggs (just about everything on the menu is coated in this amazing hollandaise)
I can seeing falling in love with this place if I lived in the neighborhood
Not really worth taking the cab though from uptown, though
How refreshing to discover a neighborhood restaurant that doesn't simply turn out the standard burger and ceasar salad
At the Saz in the West Village you can always be assured of some exciting new dish with the daily changing menu
Last night my friends and I sampled a spring leaves salad, made special by a delicious homemade blue chees dressing and oysters fried in Japanese bread crumbs followed by superb Crab Cakes and Alaskan King Salmon It was a Yummy way to break the Yom Kippur fast
Try it you'll love it like I do
We're brunch regulars
The Eggs Sazerac are lovely, and the Andouille Monterey Jack Omelette is delicious
Definitely not low fat dining
The coffee is quite nice as well
On the down-side: the servers are pleasant but routinely slack
The service detracts from what could be a top-notch brunch
Wonderful ambience when you sit inside this very old New York restaurant
The weekend brunch is a real treat - really enjoyed the BBQ Shrimp Corn Pancake and the Challah French toast
The service was attentive and they really acted like they cared
This is the quintessential neighborhood hangout
The food is a remarkeably good for the price
Even the lowly hamburger is served in a style befitting that classic american dish, On a plate, fries, sliced tomato, pickle on a delicious bun from the Newark Portugese Bakery and only 6
95 at lunch
I highlly recommend it to all
Terrific repeat style restaurant
Good food, clean and intelligent and knowledgeable servers
If your in the West Village forget trendy, eat better for less

This is a stunning find for a relative new comer to the big Apple
Just plain good food at an affordable price
The perfect neighborhood place with a wait staff almost as long in the beard as the owner
This is a diamond in the rough
The food is excellent, moderately priced and served by a warm friendly staff in a charming atmosphere
It's not haute cuisine but at these prices its a must for casual diners and for budget conscious visitors to New York City
I just happen to stumble across this fabulous find
We happen to walk by, read the menu posted outside they offered a nice selection ranging from citrus salmon, pan seared trout, chicken pot pie, sirlion steak, the fried calamari is out of this world they use a secret ingredient to their dipping sauce
What was nice is their selection of salads and pasta dishes for the vegan of our group
All of which she was able to tweak to her liking by adding either grilled salmon or grilled chicken to
The service was amazing, prompt and yet personable which is a nice touch
The prices are reasonable
The selection of wine was not only complementary to our meal
but was recommended to us by our waitress
that meant she had knowledge of the wines
Another +  I 've been back there 4 times and I think you'll like it too

I went to this place with a guy from New Orleans and we agreed the food was nothing like the Big Easy
I food was okay, but the sazaracs were bad
You would think they would be good since the place was named after them
The even put the lemon peel in the drink, which you are not supposed to do!
WENT HERE FOR MY ANNIVERSERY BECAUSE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS ROMANTIC
IT'S NOT
FOOD WAS OKAY
SERVICE WAS GOOD
WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T ORDER THE SAZARAC COCKTAIL
ITS AWFUL
The cozy atmosphere, attentive and entertaining staff were only the icing on the crab cakes


The flavorful entrees at the Saz are almost inspiring enough to make a girl want to learn to cook -- but with prices like these who wants to cook?
They have crabs! The soft shelled variety - and they're a work of art
Plus they taste great
Terrific, friendly service, easy-going, fun atmosphere
I'd go back in a heartbeat
If you're going for lunch, be prepared for it take an hour
There's always plenty of staff on-hand, but you literally have to hunt them down to get service
They're always extremely nice, and the food isn't bad (though nothing extraordinary)--it's a shame you have to wait so long for a sandwich
Other time I've been, they've gotten orders completely wrong
Maybe dinner's better
I had a birthday brunch at Sazerac House and I was very pleased
They handled my group of 12 very well and even remembered to give me a message from a friend who couldn't come
The waitresses were very friendly and the food was great
The space is darling and old, but a bit on the small side
I definitely recommend this place
If you're looking for a cozy place to hang out and have a nice dinner, this is the place
They serve cajun-ish food
Great service, wonderful cornbreadsticks, and a nice bar makes this a place to come for the ages
Not too loud, not too quiet
Food was a little saltier than I would like it, but still good
walking into Sazerac is like walking into a comfy pub in the English countryside where everyone knows each other and they welcome you as though you live there
The staff is friendly and the food is great and very comforting
The prices are so reasonable that I can afford to eat there several times a week and with thier menu changing every day I never get bored with the food
The steaks and hamburgers are the best in the city and there is always something to look forward to for dessert
Fine food at a great price served with friendly service in very warm comfortable ambience
ONE BIG JUICY BURGER, TOPPINGS, FRIES, SERVED UP RIGHT

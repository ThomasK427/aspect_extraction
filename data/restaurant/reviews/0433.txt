Great fish, great vibe, but no attitude
I didn't have to wait 3 months, just 40 minutes
Truly this place is a gem
I recommend strongly
Please open one closer to my hometown!
This was a great place to go on a Saturday nite, even though the weather was too cold to eat outside
It was crowded, the music was fun, drinks were strong and sushi was good
Pretty affordable too
The Scene Owner Mark Israel began making doughnuts in his apartment, delivering them by bicycle to small downtown cafes
These days, his base of operations is on Grand Street, and his clients include Zabar's, Citarella and Dean bakery, but doughnuts this good don't last all day; so arrive early, or it's pickles and bialys for you
The Food The doughnuts, when fresh, are meltingly soft, yeasty, fist-sized creations glazed in an array of flavors including pineapple, chocolate, mango and strawberry
The glazes take advantage of top-notch seasonal ingredients: fresh raspberries, Valrhona chocolate and so forth
These doughnuts should never be dunked in a cup of coffee: They are to Krispy Kreme as porterhouse is to White Castle
I loved them
They had fantastic doughnuts that my kids really enjoyed
not your run of the mill donut
i tried the white peach donut and nearly fell over with bliss
really, all of them looked fantastic
the donut was fluffy and perfect, and the pineapple juice was also quite tasty
i wish i could go there every day
I had seen Mark Isreal demonstrating how he makes his heavenly doughnuts on a morning talk show and couldn't wait to try them out myself
I was extremely happy when I did
They are so fresh, moist, and luscious
They are soo much better then Krispy Kremes or Dunkin Donuts
I highly recomend this place for the freshest and yummiest doughunts
I tried this place out today and it was wonderful! I had a chocolate doughnut and a key lime doughnut
Both were excellent
I'm still thinking about how tangy that key lime one was
Very inventive! Here's my question
Where did all the doughnut holes go? They didn't have any for sale
What do they do with them? Hmmmm
I also wish they had better seating and a better coffee service
They keep the milk so cold that by the time I pour it in my coffee, my coffee's too cold
Just being picky
Really excellent place
I have been meaning to get down to this infamous place for a while
but I rarely go that far down Grand St
Thank god I got to try it this weekend
They crank out some good size, extra sweet, and extremely flavorful doughnuts
I am not even a huge doughnut fan, however if you have a chance to grab one of these, don't pass it up
They were so light that I was not loaded down after eaten one
The Scene There are exactly three small tables at this tiny hole in the wall, but for food lovers on a budget, it's heaven
Five juicy, tender dumplings ring in at $1, so two people can eat themselves silly for less than $10
The two condiment bottles on the table provide all that you need: a tangy blend of vinegar and soy sauce in one, and spicy chili sauce in the other
The Food The fried or boiled dumplings come in either pork or veggie versions and are handmade, with a fragrant dose of chives
But don't overlook the other tasty Shanghainese treats: da bing (plump sesame-encrusted "pancakes" that are steamed, then fried); fried round pork buns; tea eggs; perfectly savory hot-and-sour soup; congee (a thickened rice and red bean soup); and to perfectly complement your meal, all the fresh, hot, high-protein soy milk that you can drink
I am completely hooked on this place, it is ridiculous
As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores
I go back in line like three times on average until I can't walk anymore
this is lunch for a dollar in New York City
A plate of dumplings for a dollar can't be beat
and have treasured it ever since
how do they make money with 5 dumplings for $1? simply the best food even if they charged twice as much
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $3
00 in NYC
Fried dumpling is the arguably the quickest/best value in NYC
At 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong
Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter
Get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings
All the prior reviews really are accurate
This place has amazing fried dumplings and these wonderful pork buns that defy description
Are they boiled? Steamed? Fried? They're super tasty
Food is consistently good and super cheap- highly recommended
But keep it between us, okay?
I almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself! SO SO SO SO SO good! And cheap! I wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday
Go, go, hurry, before everyone finds out about it
i went to Fried Dumpling yesterday after reading about it on citysearch
it was great
I had dinner for $2
50
their dumplings are delicious i think they are the best ive had
i also recommend the pork buns and the sesame pancake
The food tasted more authentic than the average take-out place in the city
i highly reccomend this place, but get your food to go because there are only 2 or 3 tables in the whole place
i ate mine across the street in a small park
GREAT FOOD
Can't beat the prices!!!!!!! Sesame bread is great too!!!
The place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food, the line reached the door
The food is very good for it's price, better than most fried dumplings I've had
The soup is pretty good too
It's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars
It's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner
It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table, but standing up wasn't too bad
I grew up eating my grandma's famous dumplings and making my own from scratch but found that I could get the same homemade taste with out achy hands from pinching them shut
I also brought my father who was visiting from Taiwan to this little dumpling spot, and he loved it!  The atmosphere and price is like going to a really great dumpling place in China
Don't go for the atmosphere though--it's a hole
I'm walking into this place looking for a cheap place to eat
I was half wrong
It was cheap
that was true, but the dumplings was tasty and good
Where can u beat 5 fried dumplings for a buck?! In NYC!?
If these dumplings cost $5
00 for five, they would be worth it! I was initially lured by the price but the dumplings are actually better than any I have had at even the most expensive restaurants
The chives inside and the condiments on the side are just perfect
Though it can be busy for very narrow bursts of time, non-meal times it is almost empty
Oh, MAN
the dumplings are, of course, five for a dollar
They are greasy, salty, and glorious

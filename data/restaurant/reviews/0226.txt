Like the last reviewer, the 3 of us got jammed into a 2-person table with a reservation, ate mediocre if forgettable fare, and overall had a higly unpleasant experience
And of course, after hearing that it was so cool, I was disappointed to see for myself that it was cheesy, tacky, and nothing special
wouldn't ever go back
This was one of the worst experiences I have had yet
I always go to the sushi samba downtown but myself and 2 friends decided to try this one
They sat 3 of us cramped and at 2 person table
The waiter was horrible and brought us the wrong food, not to mention the prices were astronomical
We asked the host why it cost more there than at the sushi samba downtown and he said because it's on park
I would never go there again
Friday noght a group of us went here for dinner
We had reservations yet the hostess wanted to give us a table which we would share with 3 other people! We ended up waiting for 15 minutes for a regular table for 4
The drinks are forced on you and we felt rushed
I don't know about other location, but I dont recommend this one
A very cute, uptown nook in which you can sit comfortably with colorful drinks and people-watch! Perfect for a night out with the girls
just grab a clutch, credit card and camera and you're out to experience good dining with the company of other chic, up-beat new yorkers
Your dazzling eyes are drawn to the bar which can't really be described
check it out for yourself
Plus, the waiters are cute and they have a pretty cool bathroom too!
The food was nicely presented and the restaurant is decorated nicely
However, the food did not taste as good as it looks
The 4 assortment dish of sashimi was not as good as the waiter said it was
The sauce overwhelmed the natural taste of the fish
Style over substance here
This is my favorite restaurant in the city- food is incredible every time, consistently fresh and wonderful
The chefs are creative and masters at their craft
Drinks delicious! It is expensive, but well worth every penny
What a great fusion of two vastly different cuisines- highly recommended!
SS7 was ok
More of a place to go for the trendy atmosphere and the strong drinks
Food was ok, not great
Highlight of the evening was Eve drinking a mojito at the next table
I heard that the staff was impolite; I did not find this to be the case
Not memorable, not forgettable
Blah
Reminds me of a ghetto Asia de Cuba @ St
Martin's Lane in London
This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York City
The food is heavenly
A wonderful fusion of Japanese and Latin flavors
The ceviche is to die for, also look for kolby beef specials
Every meal I've had here has left me floating and thank god for that because the wait for a table can be ridiculous with or without reservation!
Great place to hang out with friends while talking loudly
Very crowded
Food was good - not great
Very trendy
Not good for dates or small children
Good raspberry mohito
Best sushi in NYC
I highly recommend to sushi lovers
Just had a great night at Sushi Samba
Service was excellent, lively atmosphere in the roof garden, and the food was perfect !
I have gone to this place more than 6 times in the past 3 months
The drinks are AMAZING
The savichi dishes are the beauty of this place and are eaten by people who don't really eat sushi
Also, they have specials that add to the menu of excellent dishes
Finally the deserts are excellent and keep up with the unique style of the other dishes on the menu
Overall, I recommend that this restaurant is worth the cost for the experience!
excellent food, good value for manhattan, cool atmosphere, funky decor, squshy somewhat uncomfortable seats, really fun place to take a date and not blow a wad of cash, friendly and informative waiter, seviches were great, seating at the sushi bar is cool
Great location, great wait staff, great food and drinks
One of my favorite spots
The restuarant was great and so was the experience
Love the food the service was suberb
I was hesitant to go here
after reading all of the complaints on service
However walking past at 12:30, the sushi bar looked fairly open, so I stopped in, and in a time period of 45 minutes had a great lunch at a good price
not sure how dinner would be, but can't do much better for sushi at lunch
I love this place, frankly; the food is great and the mojitos are the best I've had outside of Havana
However, the service is horrible
Sushi Samba has a problem honoring reservations (we waited 45 minutes for a table the last time we were there, even though we'd booked the reservation a couple weeks previously), the waiters have too many tables so the service is not very personal, and the hostess staff has a haughty attitude that I could do without
I can't decide if I love this one better than its sister restaurant downtown but either way I love the restaurants
The food is good and the drinks even better
If you love caipirinhas, this is the place to have them
If you have the stomach for the hosts who basically act like they're manning the velvet rope at some oversubscribed ny club, then you have to stomach the crowd
You'll be perfectly happy if you're a twenty-something corporate wannabe hoping to meet a babe, but if that type gives you hives then stay away
If you're not angry and revolted by the time you get a table, then you'll have decent (nothing to brag about) food that is incredibly overpriced (even for sushi)
The best thing this place has going for it is the roof deck, though after 5 minutes in this place, you may want to jump off
My friends and I went for a quick afternoon lunch break, and we were seated very quickly
However, it was all downhill from there
We had to wait 30 min
in between courses, and then they brought out our desserts before bringing out the main courses! Our waiter never even came over to let us know what was going on! Only when I called him over, did he tell us the computers were down
Gee, thanks for letting us know
And when one of my friends had to leave early b/c our lunch was already taking over 2 hours before our main courses, they apparently gave her the wrong dish to take with her
On top of that, the manager never came over to apologize
There's more to write, but can't fit it all in
An absolute fiasco
Never going back! Sushi Samba 7, however, is a lot better
If this is the 8th best sushi place is the city, then I am going to start making my own sushi
The sushi was subpar at best and rather bland
The service was okay because no one was in there around lunch time
I wouldn't venture back to Sushi Samba unless someone paid me
The food was acceptable, the portions small, and the waiter was into himself way more than his customers
Some of the greatest iced tea, but don't assume the refills are free
When the check came, we were shocked at the $21 total
Go here for drinks (mojitos and martinis) and the scene, if you're into that
But the food? Overpriced and tiny portions
For example, sushi rolls, many of which run about $12-13, are of equal size and quality as Japanese places that would only charge half that much
I remember spending about $25 for about 3 oz
of decent sea bass
Desserts, however, are very good and creative
Decor is very trendy and chic

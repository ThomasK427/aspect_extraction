This has become a neighborhood stop for my girlfriend and I
We've been more than a dozen times and we love it
The music is wonderful, the food is delicious
The sangria is also very potent
Go on an off night because reservations are tight on the weekends
The front portion of the restaurant might be alright, but once you're past the 1st bar - forget it
It is sooooOOOOOOOO loud here that you can't even hear the peson next to you
The live music (intended to add ambience) only made the noise quotient unbearable
The food seemed quite good, but it was difficult to tell because you couldn't really relax due to the noise
The waiters had a bad attitude and mouthed back at a requests
Don't go - it's a BIG dissapointment!
The Scene Past tanks filled with shrimp in various sizes, crabs, lobsters and more, the muted dining room reverberates with an enthusiastic clientele of neighborhood Chinese families and destination-diners from elsewhere in the city
The efficient waitstaff speak little English, so non-Cantonese speakers must point to the photo menu and direct any special requests to the brusque host
The Food Fresh-killed Cantonese shellfish is the specialty of the house, although there are copious other options
A hot pot filled with fresh shrimp, scallops, and bean curd, kept bubbling at the table over Sterno, resounds with subtle flavor and texture, although a similar hot pot with mushrooms and loofah is blandness dispite its pleasing texture
A chewy, savory jellyfish salad with pickles is a terrific starter, and so are huge steamed oysters, served in the shell with briny XO sauce
Individual honey-roasted quails are also not to be missed
American tourists/_retentive New Yorkers, get over yourselves! In China the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud
The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at
You can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc
from an English speaking staff
Also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to!
Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch
The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives
To give you an idea of how good we thought it was, we ended up going to Ping's three weekends in a row!!!
I had heard such wonderful things about this place and saw all the awards they had decorated the doorway, so I was excited to have Dim Sum / lunch there
I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive
The Dim Sum was so-so, but not spectacular
Based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for Dim Sum again
I was very disappointed with this restaurant
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested
Food was okay, nothing great
Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family
I/we will never go back to this place again
My son and I were a couple of the non-Asians at Ping's for dim sum last Sunday morning
We got chopsticks and tea like everybody else
Food was great, esp strong in seafood dim sum
Staff was courteous and helpful
Definitely a place we'd go back to
Lotsa families with kids, lotsa noise, lotsa fun
Half the fun is seeing what your tablemates get and trying it for yourself--at worst you're out a couple bucks
Just smile and point with a curious expression on your face
Go for it !
Went for Dim Sum on a Sunday - BAD IDEA
Really crowded
The little man who gives you a number before you get seated is terrifying
He's running around, yelling, screaming, and grabbing your arm when he's ready for you
Had to share a table with some Chinese students who laughed every time I'd ask a server what something was
And I was the only person in the restaurant who got a fork, knife and glass of water
Why? I was the only white person in there
If a non-Asian restaurant has only one Asian patron, are they going to break out chopsticks for them? Just because I'm white doesn't mean I can't use chopsticks! The service was crazy: Hurry up! Get in! Sit down! Eat! What else do want? Nothing? OK! Get up! Pay! Get out! It's worth the trip on the 7 train into Flushing to East Manor
Dim sum here is ok
Nothing really stands out
Their seafood crispy noodle is quite good
I went for dinner-horrific
Seafood may be fresh, but they gave me perhaps worth
25lb of shrimp eventhough they charged me for
5lb
We ordered few dishes but none of them was good
They even forgot about one
Steamed chicken was disgusting(didn't have much meat on it at all)
Special fried rice-aint nothin' special about it
AND, it wasn't cheap for chinatown's prices!!!
Dimsum was warm, which is quite rare
Deep-fried ones are not that appetizing if they are cool
A la carte menu was also good
Recommended: beef roll with mushroom filling topped with peppery brown sauce, also shredded fried squid with vegetables
Went with party of 7
Dirty silverware; obnoxious service; some of the food could best be characterized as noxious goo
Terrible experience
Usually go to Joe's Shanghai or NY Noodle Town - will continue to do so
Delicious food, especially the oysters
Wish the wait staff was as yummy
In Short Early on, this local mini-chain earned a reputation for its loud bar scene
There's still an active social life centered around the bar
But the restaurant has mellowed out, and in the early evening, you'll find families and less youthful folks who have come for the food
All the barbecue is smoked in-house over hickory, and the ribs come in three varieties: Northern (sweet), Southern (spicy) and dry rub
we've been to this UWS restaurant a few times and always find the ribs fabulous
Our favorite is the northern style ribs which fall off the bone, and the well seasoned honey BBQ sauce on top of the ribs is just phenomenal!!!!! The dry rub and southern style are both very good too, so are the homemade trimmings, especially the cole slaw, fire fries (yum!), collard greens, and candied yams with walnuts
The place is decorated like a sports bar so of course no romantic, but it is not very noisy although somehow a bit too dark
We've never been to the south and Brother Jimmy's brought us to the idea of visiting the south because of the good food!!!  All in all a very pleasant dining experience!
good stuff
ribs fall off the bone and after all my drinks so did I
A bit more uptown then I am used to but worth the trip
If you wentto school in the south, this is a great place to get some good southern BBQ, and watch ACC games
Brings you back to the good ole days
I am from the south and miss my BBQ
This restaurant made me feel right at home with the relaxed atmosphere and great food
And you can't beat the fact that there are food and drink specials almost every night of the week
I am from North Carolina and a graduate of NC State
Finding Brother Jimmys is an oasis for a southerner that is missing home or just wants to be in a place that is an homage for ACC fans
The food is great southern fare, bringing in both great BBQ and lots of great fried veggies
The appitizers are not to be missed either, pulled pork or chicken quesadillas are tops and their nachos will give any restaurant a run for their money
But the best are the rib tips, do not miss
Go, drink, eat and have fun
The owners do not overly boil their ribs as so many other rib joints in NY do
The side orders are pretty good too

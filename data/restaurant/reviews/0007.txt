No one bothers you about leaving, and the coffee is good
It's a great place to hang out and talk or sober up after a long night bar hopping
It's a young crowd, and you can hang out by yourself without feeling self-conscious
Agreat place for dates, I have come here for years
The cappuccino and drinks are all excellent, and there is a good selection of wine
The pizza and pannini are also very good!  The owner is very nice and a pleasure to speak to
The Scene Though the fickle winds of celebrity restaurant-going have since directed A-listers to newer, more alluring spots, Jean-Georges' downtown eatery has still managed to remain a dining destination
The upstairs lounge is bright and open; the restaurant lies beneath in a large, open, brick-walled basement
Diners lounge on lavender banquettes beneath a ceiling of antique glass sidewalks
The Food The Provencal-inspired cuisine takes a more minimal route than in Vongerichten's other kitchens, but the clarity and brightness of flavor still inspires
Yellowtail tuna carpaccio, lightly dressed with a hint of mint, sings of summer, and crab salad partnered with sweet-hot mango mustard and greens hits all the right flavor notes
Entrees, across the board, are quite good
And dessert-- a stellar version of the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake--shouldn't be missed
I have been to Mercer Kitchen for lunch and it was terrific, but when I dined with my friends a few days ago, our dinner tasted like something I could have picked up from Boston Market
Maybe it was the choices the chefs had put on the Restaurant Week Menu, but much of our food was just so-so
Two of my friends ordered the featured salmon dish and they had to have their meals sent back twice because they were undercooked
That night the restaurant was riding on its trendiness and not the quality of its food
I may go back, but not anytime soon
The food at Mercer Kitchen is great, flavorful and nicely portioned
I had the slow baked salmon with corn pudding and it was delicious
I went there with three of my girlfriends and sampled their entrees as well and all were excellent, especially the mashed potatoes that came with my friend's roast chicken
Our server was very sweet - when my friend couldn't decide whether to substitute her side for mashed potatoes, she encouraged her to try it and told her that if she didn't like it, she could bring out mashed potatoes with no additional charge
She was visibly disappointed when we passed on dessert though
The atmosphere is very trendy, as would be expected and it is LOUD
In general, however, I would definitely go back for the food
i dine at mercer kitchen a lot with my girlfriends
maybe sometimes there's a wait but obviously you go here for the scene as well as the food
theres clearly a reason why so many people are waiting for a table
besides, whats so bad about waiting at their bar? its a scene in itself and the cocktails are wonderful
every single time i'm there i'm sitting next to a celebrity
i read the last review and couldn't disagree more
i've ordered a cheese plate there, too- the kitchen makes it for you even though it's not on the menu! try the black truffle pizza and the vodka lemonade
yum!
First of all, we had to wait for over half an hour for the wine list (our waiter informed us that it ws being updated)
Why the management waited until the dinner service had begun to update the wine list is beyond me, but this is just the beginning of the many problems
The waiter, of course had no knowledge of the yet to be produced wine list and no wine steward or manager bothered to come by the table to check in
We then had the cold seafood platter
The shellfish had been sitting open for a quit a while before service and the lump crab meat was full of shell
For the price that is charged for this platter it could as least be freshly prepared and have crab claw meat instead of backfin full of shell
On to our mains
The steak had a great deal of gristle and the hamburger was served on a burnt bun, the fries were fine
When we asked for a cheese plate, the kitchen produced a selection of cheap, flavorless garbage
When the manager stopped by to see how we had enjoyed our evening, he cut me off rudely before I could even reply
All in all, this was one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had and it is astonishing to me that in a city with so many great restaurants this one has managed to stay open
I celebrated my 24th Birthday here with 25 of my closest friends
A definite must eat
Try the chocolate cake- Ill make the trip to Soho just to order that
A funky venue with plenty of pizzaz
I went here not knowing what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised at the vibe this place has
After a couple of drinks upstairs before our meal, we slipped downstairs to a nice corner table that offered plenty of privacy in this 'loud' place
The food was of a relatively high standard, except the oysters seemed a little off
I definitely recommend this place, but Australians who like to throw phones at hotel staff are apparently not welcome anymore
I went to the Mercer Kitchen for a friend's birthday and there were 6 of us ladies
The atmosphere is nice, tables are spacious, and it's not as crowded as other NYC restaurants
The service was a bit slow, my friend had to send her food back twice, and overall the food wasn't bad
However for the price I paid to have dinner there, you would have thought I ate a horse
In the end I had, one shrimp, one oyster, two bread rolls (those are free mind you), a personal pan pizza, and two glasses of wine, and all for $87
00!!! Now ok $87 is not that much I agree but for that? Never going back
I know NYC is expensive but this is ridiculous!
I had the most enjoyable evening here! the scene was very quiet and intimate
its no wonder celebs like it as it is downstairs and away from prying eyes
there are romantic booths you can sit at and cuddle with your date
i don't know if i would recommend for a large group though as it was very low key chic
the food was to die for!! i fully recommend the cod carpacio starter
my boyfriend was still talking about the steak the next day
our waitress was new but an absolute sweetheart
this was a nice vacation from the typical LA pretensiousness i usually deal with
I had lunch at Mercer Kitchen with a friend and really loved it
The restaurant is beautiful and very chic, underground with great wood and brick detail; light filters in from skylights overhead
Everyone from the reservationist to the servers were warm and friendly, even with the busy crowd of diners
The food was delicious - my friend and I tried the sashimi and horseradish pizza (yum!) the slow roasted salmon and the chicken
Desserts were outstanding
Good wine list too, and the wines by the glass were all fresh and tasty
I will definetly go back soon, maybe next time for drinks at the cool bar that runs along the space
Mercer Kitchen was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've ever had in NY
When I went, the wait staff was all male (save for the model hostess) which is just some silly trying to be cool trend if you ask me
They were stand-offish and not overly helpful
The one person that was polite was the coat check guy
The menu was nothing spectacular nor was the dining room
Dark, downstairs
Been there, done that
NYC is full of wonderful places to eat so please, spare yourself the time and money and eat somewhere else
If you like trendy places but actually expect to have innovative food and great service then I suggest Nobu or Gotham
We had been to the Kitchen years ago and had good memories of it
Took our friends there the other night and seriously had the worst meal of my life
We had reservations for 9 but didn't get seated until after 10
Were asked to hang at the bar which was ok but crowded and you have to stand over people eating
They then stuffed us into one of those tables that should have been for four but we were 6
When food finally came it was all undercooked
Pizzas were something my son might make at kindergarden, my Salmon was still cool in the middle with not one accompanying side dish, our friends steak was like shoe leather
The scene is reasonably cool but unworth more than a drink
the food was so-so, that is the food i ate from other peoples plates since they forgot my dinner
the waiters had a really hard time remembering to bring drinks, and when they did they were not what was ordered
the ambience was ok, and the lounge upstairs was nice
the best part of the meal was the psychic readings from the ladies outside
Mercer kitchen has some steller options on their menu and some really terrible ones
Stay away from the chicken
Their menu is based on ordinary american cuisine tweaked with special sauces or made in a slightly different way
It's a hip, younger place to be

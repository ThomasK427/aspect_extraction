The service in the restaurant is quick and friendly, and when it comes to take-out, their delivery time is incredible
I almost think that the delivery man cooks the food on his bike, it is so fast
They also have an extensive vegetarian menu, and they are very accommodating when it comes to substitutions
Suzie's Restaurant serves up delicious food and great service for an amazingly inexpensive price
What more can you ask for in this pricey and chaotic city??
Never been there, probably never will
But damn it if I don't order from them two or three or four times a week
Great soups
Great lunch specials
This is the chinese food you grew up on in the suburbs, not what you'll find in Chinatown
If you want ribs or an egg roll, this is the place
They also have some Chinatown style roast meats
Good for its kind -- I prefer Chinatown
The service and food at Suzie's are great
Don't expect a gourmet meal, but if you want a pleasant dining experience, head here
They will adjust the spiciness of any meal to your specifications
Try the scallion pancakes
Best Chinese in the City! Tasty, Great Service and generally not Greasy! Sure, Wo Hops is great at 4:00am but try going there sober sometime and you'll see why Suzie's is the best!
I live 4 blocks from Suzy's, and the delivery time averages about 10 minutes
The same speed is in effect when you go to the restaurant
The food is wonderfully consistent: the general tso's (sp) chicken is always crispy, the chicken w/ broccoli is always tasty and never dry
Caveats: the roast meats are no good, and there is not a single dish you haven't seen in 500 other chinese restaurants
But damn it's fast
This is not fast food, but they serve you great food fast
I order from and go to Suzie's all the time, and I am never disappointed
The service is friendly, the food is great, and if you're lucky, you'll get a smile from Suzie herself!
The Scene In the booming '90s, celebs flocked to the leather banquettes and minimal, candlelit ambience of BondSt's downstairs lounge
The crowd is still monied, but these days you're more likely to find yourself squeezed next to a New Jersey paper millionaire than a movie star
The wannabe-model waitstaff are as gorgeous as ever, and the lighting is dim enough to conceal rather drab decor
The Food High-end Japanese goodies are sprinkled throughout the menu: Toro-caviar sushi comes with a decorative gold twist on top, foie gras meets seared tuna to intoxicating effect and arctic char garnished with truffles has almost too much flavor
Yellowtail is superb enough to make a special featuring four different types a highlight
Blue fin toro is the gorgeously soft center of a special roll
If you want variety, the excellent 6 Bond Nigiri special delivers six exotic combinations
no other sushi place can be comparable with bond ( possible sushi 55 in LA)
fresh is the point when eating sushi and you can't get any fresher ingredients like in this place
dont' miss this japanese happy people greating!
Meticulous Attention to Detail
Unique place settings
Worth the $ and the wait
Exotic Sushi selections, not your everyday sushi
This is my favorite sushi restaurant in the city
Classy ambience, and the food is fresh and high quality
The upstairs dining area is great for a romantic date
I've been to Bond St 4 times already
The food is hit or miss
Some dishes are great but others just okay
I always order the Lobster Chawan Mushi
I've never had this better anywhere else
The Fried Shrimp in Spicy Aioli sauce is very very tasty
However the fried oysters are not that great
The Risotto is also very very tasty
The miso fish is okay too
I went there last night with a couple of friends and we were so disappointed with our waitress we seriously considered not tipping
She was unprepared to discuss the menu and recommend sake and overall extremely rude
Even the fact that she was pretty-it seems to be the only criteria they consider when hiring- didn't do much for her since she was so unfriendly and pretentious
The food was okay
I recommend the crab cake and the seared tuna with foie gras for appetizers
The sushi and sashimi were not great so I would probably order a hot entre instead
I really like going to nice restaurants but would go for good service + good food over trendy anytime
I recently went back to bondst
after not having been there in some time - it's now clear why they're still as popular as ever
Service was consientious and the food was delicious and fresh
The decor is nice but it could possibly use a bit of updating
It was also good to see that the same guy (with short dark hair) is still there at the front door
It's that kind of consistency that has turned bondst
into a New York institution
I have been coming here for years and the food is more consistent than ever
A few new faces, but all the srevers are friendly and HOT
It is the best of everything here at this Exceptional sushi place
Nice atmosphere and trendy dining room but the food was only average and the service was confused at best and a disaster at worst
The waiter brought me a Sapporo, which was very nice of him but I ordered wine
Then they brought me a tempura entree, which I also did not order
We had to ask for my girlfriend's wine 3 times before it arrived
We even started joking with the couple next to us, who seemed equally disappointed
By the time we got our yellowtail, we both agreed that we'd had better at far cheaper places
Finally, it took them almost 45 minutes to get us our check after we asked for it
Maybe we just caught them on a bad night, but with so many great Japanese places in NYC, I can't imagine going back
Service: shamefully bad - the bartender was clipped and rude, setting the tone for the evening
It seems like the restaurant hiring practices are geared to cultivating an unfriendly, cooler-than-thou atmosphere
I got over aspiring to that level of obnoxious some time in the 90's, and wish the staff at BondSt would too!   If there is a redeeming factor about BondSt, its the food
It was inconsistent, though
The 6BondSt
and SushiSextet disappointed - over-marinated and combined with flavors that clashed versus complimented
I recommend the kobe beef appetizer and the spicy tuna and crispy shrimp rolls
Skip the AkaDashi soup!  BondSt is run with a real sense of entitlement
They need to do more to earn repeat business to cultivate a strong following - their following is spotty at best, which doesn't bode well for staying-power in this tough city!
Went there on a Saturday Night
Lots of pretty girls looking for a rich guy
$10 beers (they only have 3, Kirin, Sapporo, and 1 other)
Gets pretty crowded, definitely need a reservation for dinner
Bartenders look like model wannabes and threw out my friend's beer before he was finished (about 1/4 left)
When he complained, he was told, you were done with it anyway
A place to see and be seen, but if you're just looking to chill out and hang, this is not the place
We were lucky to get reservations a couple days before for a Friday nite
Super trendy
naturally
It's a nice spot though
Very romatic in the dining room
Because of our short reservations we had a table in the back by the sushi place
The food was excellent and well presented

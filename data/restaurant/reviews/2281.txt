I've given this place 3 attempts and each time it was awful
The food is average and overpriced, the service was average, each experience was different
The place is noisy
I have to say i expected it to be so much better based on other people and that's why I tried it 3 separate times so that I could give it a fair chance
I don't know what the draw is but I haven't found it yet
Sorry to say, unless it's on someone's expense account, i won't be spending my money here
My January dining experience at Cite was horrible
The restaurant was relatively empty but the service was spotty
Most of the food was okay but the steaks were fatty and tough
When the server finally came back to remove the plates he didn't ask how the meal was or why the steaks were still on the plate
When we told the waiter about the food he said:Gee that's too bad and brought us a few glasses of Port on the house
My brother spoke with the manager on the way out and he had attitude
The meal was an expensive disappointment
THE after 8 pm wine dinner was fantastic! Service was professional, personable and prompt (we got there before the crowds) Wine quality of 3 of the wines offered was very, very good
Yes it's all the wine you can drink! We had 2 bottles of the Taittenger along with all we could hold of a very smooth Chardonay, a pleasantly robust Merlot and a somewhat boring Cabernet
Appetizer and dessert were the best courses, but the Filet and veal chop were very good too
We'll be back!
I ate here with a large group, and we were seated promptly
Albeit it was a 6:30 reservation, but there was no waiting period
our table was set up by the time we got there
The food was very good, although pretty pricey for the portions
The menu was a bit limited, but a pretty extensive wine menu
I don't want to complain, because nothing is bad enough to complain about
I just can't think of anything positive to say either
Boring food
Boring decor
An outstanding location to dine, drink and have a good time
Very knowledgeable, attentive, and professional staff
Ive dined in alll of the restaurants from this company and have to say cite is the overall best one
A must try for anyone looking for a great dining experience
We had an Saturday 8PM reservation
Food was average and service was lacking
My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, medium rare and it came out charred and about medium well to well done
So he sent it back and got a different piece of filet, but it was cooked to the same temperature! The server never came back to check on us during our meal
One theory that we have to explain the food/service is that on a weekend night, they are catering to a different crowd - out of town guests who come in for dinner and a show, i
e
, one time dinner guests
Just my two cents, but I will not be going back
There are just too many other good restaurants in NYC that will provide better service and food for my $$$$
I had the filet with french fries
I don't actually believe that the cut was a filet and it was the worst steak I've ever had
totally overcooked, dry and flavorless
Even the french fries were overdone
Service was good and the location is convenient before or after a show
Overall it was below average and I don't think I'll be back
Don't go here
This place is a complete tourist trap
It is extremly over priced considering the steak was one of the worst I have ever had
It was extremly dry and chewy
The service was deplorable
We were there for over 3 hours and the waiter was very rude
I would never return there
While Cite has its shortfalls even when it's not serving the full wine dinner menu, the quality and service of this restaurant is far from the standard and quality that one would come to expect from a Smith Wollensky restaurant
It is rather a shame that the full service staff is extremely unprofessional and impolite, and that the food is no better than the TGI Friday's across the street
Do yourself a favor, when in NYC, there much worthy places to drop $100 per person on food and wine
Some things change for the worst, and this is no exception
Used to come here all the time for lunch, now both the food and service have fallen behind its reputation
These days, if you are a tourist who don't know any better, you'll likely end up here
It's a shame that a NY tradition has seen its prime
Need to desperately revamp the service and speediness
Last weekend I entertained a few friends in town at Cite
Granted, if you go after 8 pm for the wine dinner, you could care less if service slowed to a halt as long as they refilled your glass
However we were there early and settled for the pre-theater menu
As one would expect, a pre-theater menu should consist of fast, prompt service
Well they kept us there for 3 HOURS with slow, agonizing service
It was well past 8 pm when they finally got us the check, and we asked for free rounds of champagne to compensate for the poor service (since the wine dinner had started, and were denied
It was a truly disappointing experience
I regret to say that as a regular patron of Cite, I won't be coming back in the near future and have asked my friends to cancel their holiday festivities here as well
What a disappointing, aggravating and truly unforgivable experience
Food quality was awful for the price, and service was even worse
The entire restaurant staff was disappointing to begin with (any waiters over 17 with some knowledge of the menu or wine?)
The manager claims they are not set up to operate efficiently (CAN YOU BELIEVE ANY RESTAURANT WOULD MAKE THIS CLAIM?) but couldn't give an ounce of sympathy or apology for a dissatisfied party who, by the way, will never return
I have never been treated to more shameful service and attention at a restaurant in NYC than here, especially in a party of only female guests
The place wasn't even crowded on a snowed-in weekend, but the food quality was unbearable (for a $35 entree) and things were moving slower than snail pace
As a long-time patron along with other Smith Wollensky restaurants, I won't regret not coming back to any of their restaurants, nor making holiday plans elsewhere where the customer is a #1 priority
4 cancelled reservations already from friends and family speak louder than words
I went for the wine tasting dinner
The food was ok and the service was great
They did not rush us out at all
I am constantly looking for new places and looking into the ratings
I have been in the most rated restaurants in NY, yet too stuffy for me not to mention the rocketed prices
Cite is a fantastic choice
It is a must
The wine dinner is truly amazing, great choices of unlimited wine, Tattinger champagne and a super dinner
As somebody said in their reviews, why go to other restaurants
The cuisine, service, ambiance and value is outstanding
Congratulations to the restaurants owners, management and employees
You have me there for sure, including my referrals
Hoping great and continued sucess !
I frequently dine at The Cite Grill for lunch, and I have to say the food, service, and ambience are what every business lunch should be
I have made many deals with clients in the Cite Grill and hope to make many more
The daytime host remembers my name and table on every visit
All new york maitre d's should take lessons from this guy
The personal touch is well above and beyond
The portions size at Cite was tremendous
My wife had the largest Prime Rib I'd had ever seen while my filet was not a small task to finish
Some may think that a large quantity means less quality when it pertains entrees
However, this establishment definitely puts those type of assumptions to rest
The food was terrific and was reasonably priced for a nice steak dinner in NYC
Before dining we could not remember the exact time of our reservations and stopped by to confirm them

A group of us went there last week and we all really loved it!! The first thing I noticed is that it has a kind of unique shape
Its like a greenhouse, but they serve Indian food!! The second thing I fell in love with was their tamarind sauce and if you drizzle it over a hot vegetable samo sa you are in for a treat!! They were so good, we kept ordering more of them
We also sampled some dishes from their tandoori oven, primarily lamb and chicken, and they were flavorful and tender
And they come out sizzling on these platters and create a bit of a spectacle! Hehe! We thought that was neat
Going forward, Mughlai is a keeper on my restaurant list
I just hope they deliver!!
I didn't think it was possible to get bad Indian food in NYC, but it is after all
Not only was the food terrible, but it was very much over-priced for what you got
On average a main dish was about 16-20 dollars (not including rice), but the quality and taste was much lower than what you would get at a place that charges 8-12 dollars
The food was very oily and very bland and the meat dishes came with big chunks of gristle and fat
Additionally, I went with a group of four so I was able to try various dishes and I was disappointed with all of them
The saving grace was the mango lassi, but you can get this at any Indian restaurant (with very little variance in taste), and with a price tag of 5 dollars, I suggest you do
My friends and I were very disappointed with the food here, as we're all big Indian food fans
There was absolutely no spice and little flavor to the food, even after we asked for them to make it extra spicy
Considering how expensive this place is, we were not happy
The quality of the food was not even on par with the cheap places on 6th street
If you like very very mild, overpriced Indian food however, you may like this place
Mughlai is a staple in my neighborhood
I absolutely love going there! I always joke to my friends that Mughlai reminds me of the TV show 'Cheers' because they always remember me and remember WHAT I like and HOW I like it
I feel kind of like an Indian Prince, if only for a few hours
My favorite is their bright red-orange Chicken Makhani with some fluffy garlic naan and a yogurt they call raita
Truly a perfect combination!!
My fianc and I came to eat lunch here and had no idea what was in store for us
First they sat us down at a table that had old food caked onto the placemats
We asked if the table could be cleaned and the waiter, very annoyed, moved us to another table
We each ordered mango lassi and waited for our main course
We waited 45 minutes and there was no sign of our food
Since it was a small restaurant, we were sure it was not possible they had forgotten about us, but all the people who had come in after us were getting their food
When we asked where our food was it turned out they never even brought our order to the kitchen
We told them to cancel our order, paid for the lassi (outrageous $5 a piece) and left
Our waiter didn't even apologize
I have not been to any Indian restaurant on the UWS that can compare to Mughlai
Food is always excellent, as is the service
I've been there 30-40 times and I've never had anything less than an excellent experience
i have a residence on the upper west side, yet i never found myself going to this cute glass restaurant on 75th street
MUGHALI!! but that will all change now, as i had one fantastic meal there the other night
in fact, it was so damn good and i kept raving about it so much that my wife finally said, please stop telling me and post it to citysearch or zagats or something!! so now here i am telling you about this truly awesome meal i had
fresh ingredients, bold, bright colors in the food, fluffy breads, buttery rice
mmm!! and it all went perfectly with their chilled king fishers (it's an indian beer that i highly recommend)
so anyhow, hopefully now that i have told you, the citysearch population, i will stop driving my wife so nuts! cheers!
The Food was Ok
I have eaten better tasting and better spiced Indian Food
The service was what makes me write this review
It really was good
The food here is great! The tandori shrimp is mouth watering and you must try the tomato soup
It is to die for! Its a little pricey, around $30 a person but well worth it!
When living in the area, we ordered from Mughlai once a week or more
The food is mostly very good, one of the best in the city, but I wish it was more consistent, but as you might have noticed, a lot of indian food is the the same
Thus, this place is great
awesome! one of the finest in the city! we'll be back very soon, highly recommended
the menu is original and the prices are reasonable
Mughlai was wonderful
My boyfriend and I had dinner there before the opera
It was wonderful
The wine is a little overpriced but the food was VERY good
At the end of our meal we also received shots of Peach Schnapps on the house and a taste of rice pudding with rosewater
Excellent!
We love Mughlai
It's a little Indian botanical garden with the sweetest most considerate staff
The food is so good that we eat here the night before every trip we take just to get our vacation off to a great start
The Scene High ceilings, glittering chandeliers and tapestries on the wall give Picholine an imposing Old World vibe that's right in sync with the room's mature and monied crowd
Service is coddling and correct and there's no sense of hurry, so diners linger over a cheese course or a round of liqueurs
The Food After 10 years and numerous other ventures for executive chef Terrance Brennan, the kitchen seems to be coasting
A few gorgeous dishes remain, such as a crab salad with grapefruit-Campari granite, avocado, grapefruit gelee and fresh grapefruit
But heavily smoked and spiced squab "pastrami" overwhelms a pomegranate-dotted salad, and undercooked potatoes and a pasty date puree make a sorry accompaniment to a wan pieces of pheasant
Venison is tender yet missing any robust flavor, and an intense red-wine reduction overwhelms the dourade
Still, the lavish cheese cart is a wonder of careful selection
This was a wonderful dining experience-- the food was absolutely perfect
With respect to the menu, there are a few options-- A) two tasting menus: a regular tasting menu, a cheese tasting menu, and B) the 2 course, 3 course, or 4 course choice
With respect to the 2-4 course choice, you can choose any combination of the following (which seems a bit confusing at first): 1) 1 appetizer and 1 entree, 2) two appetizers and one entree, 3) one appetizer, one entree that is a smaller appetizer portion and one full entree, and the aforementioned combination may or may not include dessert according to your appetite
The food is very rich and very good
I have never felt I had to write a review for restaurant until now
We have dined at Picholine this evening and were very let down to say the least
All reviews we had seen for this restaurant had been positive
Perhaps we had a bad night
In short our food was oily and was barely touched, to which nobody inquired if everything was alright
We decided to leave before the remainder of our pre-fixe courses were served
Our recommended wine was below par and we have not been known to shy away from most wines
The dining area was so very noisey that conversation was strained
In all for approx
$600 for dinner for 2 I have had better meals at restaurants that served only house wine and cost approx
$50 for 2
As said perhaps an off night but my what a night
I have been here on various occasions and not once have I been dissapointed
Worth every penny
I would like to give an example of a night out at Picholine for a normal middle to upper class American couple
This is for anyone questioning the dinner cost of the restaurant
$100 Bottle of Merlot  $35 Cork Fee $58 Fixed Appetizer and Sirloin Entree $58 Fixed Appetizer and Sirloin Entree $20 Glass of Merlot $20 Glass of Merlot  Total of $291 plus tax  The ambience, great tasting food, and and professional quality of the staff really brings Picholine up to an exceptional level of a NYC restaurant
One of the top 5 best of NY in my opinion
P
S
For anyone in there mid to upper 20's in age, dont feel uncomfortable taking a date or wife to a restaurant like this
Also, the wine list is HUGE!!
I ate at Picholine last week, and everything was wonderful! Courteous staff and expedient service
The food was divine, and I especially enjoyed the delectable cheese course! I would recommend Picholine to anyone
This restaurant is one of the gems of new york
The overall experience was wonderful
I had a four course menu with cheese on a recent visit, although I had been there 3 years ago and its even better now, the food was tastier than at some 4 star restaurants with exciting combinations that i can still remember now And then theres the wine and the relaxed yet professional service and needless to say the cheese
Ambience: the space was cozy and the noise level was pleasantly low, but the decor had a worn-out, tired edge
Service: professional and efficient  Food: the tasting menu was solid, but uninspiring, everything was pretty good, but nothing was truly memorable, the cheeses were good, but frankly almost all of the cheeses are available at Fairway/Citarella for a fraction of the cost  Value: Dinner for 2 with 4 glasses of wine total= $400

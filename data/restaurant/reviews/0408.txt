the steaks were all over done
only thing good was that the service was decent and seated us though we over 30 minutes late
Somehow, the decor and food doesn't have the magnet of its sister restaurant L'Express
I find everything average, include decor, food and service
But it certainly passes for a casual meal around that neighborhood
At least it's not overpriced
I stopped in on Sunday with a friend, for a post-movie meal
From the exterior, I was expecting a nice faux-parisian bistro atmosphere
However, instead of getting L'express, we ended up with something closer to Le Big Mac  The first red flag was a giant TV screen in the cafe area playing (I'm not even kidding) America's Funniest Videos
If there's anything more unappetizing than a hick from Idaho hitting himself in the crotch with a rake, it's a tourist from Nebraska laughing up his overpriced sandwich upon viewing
The menu was generally uninspired and ill-prepared, but even more disappointing was the pitiful beer selection
The service was just so-so; we had to remind our waiter pointedly to bring out bread  Pigalle had awful ambiance, food, and service
I would avoid it and leave it to the residents of the Days Inn and the nearby Howard Johnson
After reading some of the reviews, I did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised by the fresh snapper in a delicious sauce, interesting escargots with lots of parsley and garlic, and good desserts
My husband's steak au poivre was also very tasty, although it was more well-done than medium well
The place is loud and a bit touristy, but the food was great especially for the reasonable prices
Due to an incident that happened the night before, I hesitated coming here but it was my clients' choice
All was going well until the server asked us how our meal was, when one of us admitted that his ham hock was all bone and no meat, we were advised by the server and the manager that there was nothing they could do
Instead of offering an additional piece or any kind of compensation, they suggested that we purchase an additional meal
Not once did the manager offer an apology or a viable option
Thanks
Was the food good? Who cares at this point
Hey, it's open 24/7 and it's good
What else is there to say? Well, be sure and try breakfast
lots o'food for not much money
Late night, post-theatre dinner was also very good
Will definitely go back
Pigalle is a nice spot for a quick lunch or a pre/post theatre meal
Food is uniformly decent, not outstanding but fine all around
Prices are a bit high, but if you want a light bistro meal this is a decent, convenient option
going to the theatre with 45 minutes to eat and voila pigalle
(sitting next to open french doors) escargo, and scallops, then an order of soft shell crabs and out in time for the show
great food and great service i will happily make this my pre-theatre venue of choice
Pigalle is pretty and laid back, with an attentive wait staff and a nice, authentic French ambience
Try the many kinds of beer (Belgian Kwak comes in an insane wood-and-glass beaker), the Merlot, and the coffee
Food is comme-ci comme-ca, and pretty pricey
Better to come here for an after-theater snack, or post-party relaxation at 4 am
For a 24-hour joint, particularly in midtown, it's unusually classy
The food in our late night meal was certainly acceptable
it was the only place we ate in New York where we were met at all with what use to be called the New York Attitiude
after the main course the waitress brought desert menus and never came back
We had to ask after 20 minutes for the check
It was after midnight at this point and the reastarant was not crowded
We ate at three restaurants we choose from this site and this is the only one we will never return to
decent french food at a fair price and the good thing is that it's open 24 hours a day
it's hard to find a decent place in the wee hours after partying
I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL(OR BAD SERVICE )@ PIGALLE
GREAT PLACE TO GO AFTER THEATER
THE TOURISTS MUST BE AFRAID OF FRENCH FOOD
My first visit to NYC for dinner in many years
I realize the cost of everything is high there but I'm still trying to be fair considering my previous life in Houston
The food was very sweet for French cuisine
The ambience was nice with the open outside walls facing the sidewalk
The wait staff was flawless
This is an all around good place to take people for dinner
I went with a large group and had no problems getting a table
The layout is spacious and we didn't feel cramped (like you do in most hellskitchen restaurants)
The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable
The steak frites I had was delicious -- one of the best steaks I've had in a while -- melted in my mouth
They also made a great Kir, and had a good selection of wines
Oh, and the desert that I had was amazing - chocolate mouse served with an orange dipping sauce
After showing my girlfriend around New York past midnight, we stumbled upon this 24 hr restaraunt
The people were very polite and it wasn't crowded at all
Prices were very resonable and the setting was amazing
Perfect Margarita's and excellent seafood
A cozy spot to bring someone with some very romanitic tunes coming from the jukebox
It is a must every time in NYC
The Scene This handsome Vietnamese restaurant puts an urbane spin on a cuisine often associated with ramshackle decor and rock-bottom prices
Soft lighting, wood floors and lemon-custard walls set a serious tone, though the noise level gets high at peak hours
Service can be a distraction
Understaffing is a problem, and the kitchen tends to drag its feet when confronted with a full dining room
The Food Nam plays familiar Vietnamese classics like rice-noodle and beef soups, spring rolls and crepes, but its most worthwhile efforts are more elaborate seafood preparations
Sure bets include a crisp-skinned sauteed red snapper in a viscous, faintly sweet sauce of chile and lime, and a steamed sea bass served with an earthy mix of mushrooms and stewed tomatoes
Chicken-based efforts are less compelling
Desserts--warm banana bread, ginger flan, chocolate mousse cake--are simple but effective
I love Nam, the food is fantastic and the staff is ultra-nice and very very friendly/attentative
The only drag is the space is a little limited and the crowd tends to be a little older, late 30s
Our server was fine, but the mood was spoiled by an dreadfully unattentive host
Our reserved table was set-up and ready when we arrived, yet he made us wait for over a half hour before he seated us
He kept on saying to give him a minute, but all he was doing was running around the room with a clipboard and rearranging the same 3 tables over and over again, obviously just trying to look busy
He told us to wait at the bar, unfortunately they do not really have a bar, only a tiny service bar next to the kitchen entrance
The food was average, it's hard to go wrong with good ingredients and tangy sauces, but there was nothing special or inventive
There are Vietnamese places in Chinatown that do just as well, even better, and for a lot less money and with a lot less attitude
Great atmosphere, and ordinary food
Nice try of mixing Vienamise cuisine and continental, although, not quite fused well
Good looking waiters w/ below average service
Could be good for date, but not your fist date
Wait staff was unattentive; service was slow and noone checked on us throughout the entire dinner
In the middle of dessert, the waitress silently passes by and drops the check
We speak to the manager about the terrible service and laying down the check before we were done with dinner
The manager replies, It's what we do
It's a high volume restaurant where we need to turn the tables quickly
Unless you want to be treated like a revolving door, don't come here
Admittedly the food is flavorful and enjoyable, but I left in the end with a bitter taste--and for the first time in my dining experience, left no tip
My boyfriend and I have been to Nam twice and we absolutely loved it! The soft glow of the lights, the bamboo wall, and the coziness of the room made for a very amiable setting
The food was delicious and the portions were perfect, not too big and not too small, contrary to what others have written
Also, all of our food arrived steaming hot and in a timely fashion (we HATE to be rushed, but we don't want to starve, either!)
The prices were also quite reasonable, including prices for the wine
We also received wonderful service both times
The servers were friendly and pleasant, but not obtrusive

I recommend a reservation because the place gets jammed
Do yourself a favor and start with the fresh gaucamole it was outstanding
I also recomended the red snapper tacos - fresh and tasty! Finally, wash it all down w/ a pitcher of sangria!
Excellent service
Very attentive
The food was great!!! I loved the atmosphere and there is plenty of room
I am a hardcore mexican fan, and my boyfriend decided to surprise me with this new restaurant that just opened up
the restaurant itself is beautiful
there is a man outside who opens the door
it is EXTREMELY packed, but we did have reservations (hint, hint)
everything we had was good gaucamole, chicken tortilla soup, and the sirloin was amazing
the place wasnt too expensive and the ambience just put this place over the top!!!
VERY disappointed
The Duck Tostada was the only memorable item we tasted
actually no, the other 5 dishes were memorable as well
because they were so bad
Expensive, bad service and weak drinks
Grrrrrrrr !!
My roommate and I took a friend here for her birthday, and we had a blast
The food is great, the staff is super friendly and attentive, and there is some great people watching to be had
It's a little loud, but you will be too busy devouring the guacamole that is made to order at your table to care
It just opened in September, so to be safe, make reservations, go with and empty stomach, and eat like its your job!
This was by far the worst meal I have had in years
The waitress was clueless re: The Food (Although she was polite) AND the tequilas
We all ordered the same margarita with the same tequila and besides being terrible , they tasted nothing alike
All of the food was Under Seasoned and tasted like the same spices were used in every dish
The ceviche was a mass of rubbery and mushy Under Seasoned mystery fish and the desserts were just plain ill-conceived
The manager also managed to insult one of my dining partners, even using an expletive to mock his last name when returning his credit card
TERRIBLE all the way
We had a birthday dinner for 7 people on a Monday night and the evening went very well
There was some initial chaos with the reservation - we have room for 5 people at 8:15 but not at 8:30
but we have room for 6 people at 8:30 but not at 8:15
But everything worked out (and we had table that easily fit 7) and the food and drinks, especially the Prickly Pear margarita, were great
The tableside guacamole was fantastic and two orders (supposedly for 4 people) easily fed 7
Most everyone loved their food, although the mahi mahi was way overcooked
We tried 4 deserts (we ordered two and they brought us extra - very nice touch) that were all amazing
While I give them credit for their effort Dos Caminos does not live up to other Steve Hanson ventures
The food is just plain lacking and the atmosphere is what you would expect from a cavernous restaurant on Park Avenue South
With all this city has to offer in regard to Mexican food you're better off elsewhere
YUM
The food was terrific; the atmosphere was beautiful
Finally Mexican in a sophisticated setting
and that guacamole table side
To die for!
We went to Dos Camions just a few days after it opened for dinner
Our waiter was very attentive and friendly, as was the rest of the staff
The guacamole was quite good as was the prickly pear cactus frozen margarita--their specialty
The chilean sea bass and chocolate torte dessert were EXCELLENT, though the grouper could have been better
Dos Caminos is great for a pleasant dining experience
Not one of Steve Hanson's best
Too bad Mr
Hanson has broken the mold to which he has built a very successful enterprise
Guess with the passing of Coconut Grill, he lost his string of success following Danny Meyer
Maybe too much of a stretch
Great space (as we have all been b4), decor as always, great bar and drink
Quite a scene to be seen
Food bland and unimaginable
Expensive and not even worth it
better off with Benny Burritos
Waiters have to learn menu and techniques
The thing you love about all Mr
Hansen's places are you can eat there several nights per week and never get sick of it
Resonably priced, know what you are getting and always a great time and meals
Sorry Steve
Adios
DC has much going for it -- accommodating staff, fun decor, a bustling bar, serving lovely prickly pear margaritas
Our lunchtime party of five walked in reservation-less
Staff was welcoming and accommodating
But, service quickly went downhill
Guacamole guy was soooo slow, and the guacamole was bland at best (requested spicy)
Then, we couldn't find anyone to ask for salt
A female guacamole-maker prepared her table's quickly and expertly though
Staff was very slow, but appeared to remove plates before all were finished
When asked how long the decaff
coffee had been sitting, waiter said, Only about an hour
and thought that was a good thing
Ceviche appetizer was eh, empanada appetizer (lobster? shrimp?) was lovely, shrimp entree was tasty
Others in party had somewhat positive comments, but nothing spectacular
I'll go back again in the hopes they've ironed out their kinks
They should start with some serious guacamole-prep
training
I went to Dos Caminos last week and I have not had that good of a meal in AGES!!! It was wonderful
The menu had such variety for all tastes and the table side guacomole
what can I say except, I didn't even like guacomole before last week! Thank you Dos Caminos!
I am lucky enough to have experienced both lunch and dinner at Dos Caminos and have sampled a large selection of the menu, but my favourite item, even more so than the delicious, made-at-the-table guacamole, are the fabulous spiced fries which come alongisde the burger on the lunch menu - AMAZING!!
I was so excited when I heard we were going to eat there saturday night
I loved everything about it
decor, ambience, bumping into friends, they accomidated a large party
but the food was no good! I def
want to go back and try it again b/c I had such a great time!!!!
Amazing! Delicious food and attentive and great service
Great decor and ambience, it's NYC nightlife meets modern mexico
The bar tends to get VERY full, but once you treck up to the host stand you know you're in for a great meal
Beautiful staff with compelling hospiality
You must try the prickley pear margarita!!!! Reservations a must unless you want to sit at the bar for an hour - I already called for my next reservation
The food here was bland, boring and overcooked in most cases, the service was some of the worst and slowest I've encountered, drinks were weird
Strawberry Basil Margarita? Give me a break! This is basically one of those overly hyped singles bars pretending to be a restaurant, and better guacamole can be had elsewhere for less than $12

What a great dining experience at Dos Caminos
Outstanding service! Ask for the Mexican Mojito or Dos Caminos margarita

the drinks were great as usual, especially the mojitos! I've been a few times before but they must have changed the menu around
we ordered some appetizers and tapas plates and we all loved them! I highly recommend if you're in the mood for some good cuban food!
We were a party of 6 people Sat night (w/reservations)
Drinks were great but once the server took our order he all but ignored our table! Never asked us if we wanted more drinks, sat with dirty dishes in front of us
I finally waved him down to ask for a dessert menu and then we had to wave him down to get the check
Unbelievable! Food was a bit bland and appetizers arrived luke warm
Unfortunately they automatically added 18% service to the check, which is probably why the waiter didn't care if we needed anything or not
Will NEVER go back!
I don't understand how this restaurant was on the best Cuban food 2005 list
The ropa vieja was awful but the only good thing was the mojito
Buy 1, get 1 free happy hours make each Mojito (the best Ive ever had) $4
50, that's a great price for a cocktail in the City
Also the early bird dinner from 5pm - 7pm was OUTSTANDING
You get a lot of food (3 courses) for the $19
95 and it can be easily shared between two people
The food, is exquisite hispanic food not just cuban
The quesadilas were better than some I've tasted in Mexican restaurants
It's a must all the way round
I'm a big fan of Agozar
I love going there for dinner and trying lots of new things cause everything tastes so good
But i also really like going there for a drink or two
Whatever it is, I always have a good time there and I'm always treated well
salad, had minimal black beans, advocato and corn
not worth the $9
the cuban sandwhich was made on sloppy french bread
not a pressed sandwhich which I would expect from an 'authentic' cuban restuarant
Everything was alive and full of life at Agozar's on Friday night
My party orignally just came in for the great happy hour, but after smelling and seeing the fantastic food coming out of the kitchen, we couldn't leave til we had a taste
Very Friendly people
Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very helpful when asked for a recommendation
The Salmon was amazing and the Mojitos and the appetizers are wonderful and original! This is my husband and my favorite restaurant and we'll be back again and again!
We waited to be seated and spoken to by our waitress once and that was basically to order
We were both hungry and hoped the food would outweigh the lack of service
Once the food arrived we were surprised it was full of color and plated nicely
Only a few moments after that we realized the mix of colors was to over compensate for the BLANDEST cuban food we had ever tasted
The rice tasted like Uncle Ben's, the meat was not cooked thoroughly and had some pepper flake thrown on top for kick
I guess to this slacking duo, some pepper flake consitutes flavour
We had our water glasses filled once and got the most attention from the bus boy who even got us our check
I would never go back to this place again and be weary the food is not authentic and tastes watered down
We hosted a big party for about 40 people here and it turned out magnificent! The food was wonderful, the back room was perfect for 40 people, the service was great, and we even got to hire our own band! One thing that I was initially worried about was the fact that they required us to pre-purchase alot of alcohol, and I wasn't sure if we would be able to drink that much
But, their mojitos and sangria were so good that the pitchers were emptied with no problem
Finally, I was able to work closely with the two owners in planning the party
They were very flexibile to our needs and that is what really made the difference
How many owners of a hip NYC restaurant are that accessible? Thanks Diana,Gerardo,and Agozar
We decided to try this place the other day
It took over 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive
Food arrived quickly but we never saw the waitress between courses
Had to go up to the bar ourselves to get salt for our French fries
At the end of the meal, she brought coffee for those in our group who ordered the prix fixe dinner, but didn't offer coffee to the rest of our party
Food was pretty good, actually, but with such poor service, we'll never go near the place again
I had a small birthday celebration here tonight with three of my friends and it was amazing!!!! We arrived right on time to take advantage of their earlybird 3 course prefix menu ($20) and two for one priced happy hour drinks
My prefix dinner was composed of garlic shrimp appetizer followed by a yummy skirt steak complete with handcut fries
For dessert there was flan and flourless chocolate cake
I went to college in Miami and never thought I could find Cuban food this good in New York but I now have a new favorite place on The Bowery
Have a few Mojitos and you will be singing your own birthday song
Did I mention the Drinks were two for one??
Party of 4 (two couples) went to Agozar for dinner on a Tuesday night
There were approximately 3 other couples in the entire restaurant
Hence, it was slow and the service should've been phenomenal
Negative
Service was awful
The waiter never came by to check on us after the bus boy brought us our food
We saw him again when he delivered the check
Food and alcoholic drinks were simply ok
Absolutely, nothing to brag about
No sodas were available as the machine was out of service
They offered us Cranberry juice that tasted sour and tart
A bunch of us got together for a bachelorette dinner and boy was it great
Agozar brings you alive the minute you walk in the door
The service is great and the music was upbeat the entire time and not overwhelmingly loud either (I hate that)
The mojitos were FAB and they even sold them in pitchers which was great for our big group
We ordered almost every flavor and shared them all
As for the food, we allowed the waitress to handle a lot of the ordering since we were such a big group, and she did great
The empanadas and shrimp in garlic sauce appies were great
And the entrees were even better, I had the steak and it was to dye for
I highly recommend agozar to all!
Who is that man by the door with that grimace on his face? I think he's the co-owner! Our dinner at Agozar was a terrible experience
The hostess told me she could accomodate my group without a reservation but we ended up waiting nearly an hour and were seated in the smallest cramped area
But then, the whole restaurant is a small, cramped area
The menu is pricey and the food was not tasty - except for the tostones with garlic and oil
They were good
I don't know why they boast the best mojitos in NYC because they were terrible
The staff was rude
The portions were ridiculously small
Do not get the steak dish
The shrimp appetizer was tasty but the quesadilla was a joke
There was only half of a quesadilla on the plate! You can definitely eat better elsewhere and for much less!
The tasty but wimpy $30 pitcher of mojitos fed the four of us one tiny low-ball glass each
It was more of a half-pitcher; what a rip-off
Service was slow and inattentive, our salad was missing ingredients, and the pork-chop was more dry and tasteless than their pathetic decor
It looked like a high-school cafeteria!
I had a large dinner people Agozar was accomodating (but it did take awhile for us to be seated)
The food was excellent
Wasnt too impressed with my main dish but that didn't matter since I had filled up on tapas
The tapas were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
Everything from tostones the highly addictive maduros to the shrimp ceviche empanadas (order the platter of all 3 so you can get a bit of each flavor) were mouth-wateringly good
Their mojitos are absolutely awesome as well
My personal favorite was the coconut mojito
Order the pitcher save yourself a few bucks in the process
The only bad thing is that the place is kind of small but all the other great things about this place more than makeup for that one little drawback

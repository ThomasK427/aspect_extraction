NOT RECOMMENDED
GO: Bowls were dirty and when we asked for clean bowls (oh yeah utensils too) the waiter said we shouldn't make a big deal about it
My leftover steak was given to me in a foil but no bag
When we complained about the bad service the waiter said we should go somewhere else because he doesn't consider Steak Frittes, the restaurant that pays his bills, to be fine-dining so what should we expect
I complained to the manager who seemed stunned and embarassed but it's obvious nothing has been done about this since I'm reading negative reviews going back to January 2004
What a disappointment! On top of it all, I was with family from out of town and the only reason I took them there was because a friend had mentioned the place and Coffee Shop had a little wait
NEVER AGAIN!
Nice shiny day
We were at Union Square and decided to call Steak Frites to make sure we have a table outdoor
Unfortunately no place any more at the terrace but we were told we could have the table just next to the open window
So reservation is made for 4 people, for 5 minutes later
Already enjoying the moment
We arrived exactly 3 minutes later, so 2 minutes before our due time
Our table was
not available anymore
Although the waitress had clearly our reservation on her book, she told us somebody arrived one minute ago and being first to arrive, he could have our table
We refused another table, inside
What is the point to call and have a table confirmed when this elementary commercial rule is not respected ??? We won't go and try the food
The service is just not acceptable
So this spot is local for me and a great idea -- my very own Les Halles! But it ALWAYS dissapoints
Last night -- no utensils on the table when we sat down, we mentioned it, still none when our food arrived
Waiter not very pleasant, but that's not a deal-breaker
The mediocre food, however, is
First off, the steaks frites on the prix fixe doesn't come with frites
It comes with some crappy mayonaisse-y potato gratin thing that boarders on vile
The steak itself was okay
Two people at my table ordered duck confit
They got duck magret served to them
(Which they ate anyway cause they were hungry
) The deserts are sad
They come straight from the fridge, on a freezing cold plate
And they're not really cooked right -- which is a shame, cause they're such classic french desserts
I keep wishing this place were better
Let's face it, French bistro cuisine really isn't anything special
If you do want it however, Steak Frites does a good job
They cook their meat well and the fries, as expected, are good
They also have a nice wine list
I recommend the Maison L'Aiglon St
Chinian
I have eaten there twice for the sunday brunch
The food is decent, average bistro food, the decor is nice, but the service is poor, the waiters always seems to have to many tables andcant keep up with a good services
What an unfortunate experience
I've been to Steak Frites a couple of times a year for the past six years, it's generally been a consistently great experience
Until this last visit - the service was horrible (no napkins on the table; no bread was brought out; the waiter ignored us; no refills of water); the meat was fatty; the bernaise was congealed; the wine we ordered was out of stock (but no one bothered to tell us until we asked); the frites were cold; and special dietary requests were ignored
I can confidently say that I will never go back
My table ordered two items (Salmon and Steak Frites) the salmon was returned to the kitchen due to its poor taste and smell
The steak was below par, ordered medium--was delievered burned on the outside, although still pink in the middle
The wine list is basically moot, given the fact that 80% of the bottles are out of stock
An unfortunate incident is my summation of the evening at Steak Frites
My friends and I went there last night for dinner and we had a great night
The service was great - prompt seating and the friendliest waitress i ever had
The food was great as well
The hanger steak was phenomenal
I ordered the lamb shank and it was just as great
The wine prices were very extremely affordable and a great selection
Honestly, it was a great night with great food and even greater service - i can't even begin to imagine what some of the reviewers are talking about
We will definitely go back again!!!!
I don't know why I chose to ignore the negative reviews of this place
Unfortunately, they were right on target! The Steak Frites was tough/chewy and the service very disappointing (especially considering that the restaurant was empty - I guess some people are taking the reviews to heart!) I was entertaining some out-of-town business associates and frankly I was embarrassed to have taken them here
Please, don't make the same mistake I did!
I went to Steak Frites during Restaurant Week this summer, and, after finishing our entrees, it took them 1
5 hours to bring out my dessert
Since we were in a rush, I asked if I could have it to go, and they still brought it out on a plate and told us the presentation would not be the same if they wrapped it up for us
Maybe the place was particularly busy because it was Restaurant Week but no restaurant should have such bad service, especially during a time it is trying to promote itself
went to celebrate mom's b/day
if steaks are their primo offering, I would try elsewhere for better quality taste
quite disappointed with their soft shell crab with risotto, duck was dry tough, the hangar steak a poor choice, mashed potatoes no taste, frites dry hard
the mixed greens with goat's cheese the dessert were excellent tho - don't expect the ice cream soda as described but the chocolate dessert was fab
all in all not worth the time time the server did not have
she was practically absent serving another larger party
waste not want not, don't bother - fleur de sel is much better
We had a reservation at 8:30 and were not seated until five to nine, and were then seated at a table with a broken headrest
I asked to speak to the manager about this
When someone came by, I asked if he was the manager and he said to me, Look at my waiter's uniform, do I look like the manager?
The rest of the dinner was even worse
The chicken we ordered couldn't be worse
The steak frites were burnt, greasy and soggy
We sent our entrees back and at the end of the night were charged for them
We had to argue for literally twenty minutes about why we aren't paying
This restaurant is horrendous and it was one of the worse dining experiences I have ever had
Do yourself a favor and go next door to Union Square Cafe
DO NOT GO HERE
This is the worst restaurant I have ever eaten in
We were seated a half hour late and the chicken entree which we all ordered looked raw on the outside and had the worst taste ever
It was served with a sauce that looked like fatty jello-like garlic gravy
The chickens hanging in the window in China Town look more appealing
The servers are fine, but they are bound by the philosophy of the most inhospitable restaurant group in Manhattan
When we all sent our chicken served with soggy french fries back, they still expected us to pay for it and fought us for 30 mins
No joke
The experience at McDonalds is better--atleast that comes with a smile
Some people doing there reviews are too harsh on this restaurant
We Americans need to relax and enjoy our dining experience, and not be on the clock
The food as a whole, was above average
At my table we ordered two hangar steaks, with one being very good and other a little chewy
The salmon was great, as was the lobster risotto
The best part of the meal was the mussels with the provencale sauce
I don't know how anyone could bash this restaurant's mussels or fries
To finish the meal, we had one of the better creme brulees in a while
Now in terms of service, the place was fairly quiet when we went and the waitress was fine
I would definitely recommend this place for the mussels alone

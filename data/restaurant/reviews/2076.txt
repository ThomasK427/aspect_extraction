You cannot leave without tasting a margarita!
I've been going to this place for years and its good to finally see it show up on one of these lists of the best
Its nota fancy place for a first date or anything like that
The food is authentic mexican the prices are good and its in a good location
If you're looking for the real thing go to Burrito Loco you can't go wrong
Try a frozen margarita they are great, but could use a little more alcohol
It's a cozy mexican restaurant
Despite bad reviews, my friend and I decided to check out the place ourselves: the service was great, food was delicious, huge portions
worth the money
In a nutshell, small quiet restaurant with everything highly recommended in it
The food is great! Service is good! Drinks are fantastic
Its not a fancy place but, its cozy and kinda romantic :)
In fact I was more than satisfied with this mexican dig
The food was plentiful and tasty
the opportunity to savor the different moles and poblano salsas was great
And the drinks were fun
I hope to come back
The service was nice too
I ordered a pork chop special that was especially bad
it was 1/2 fat and the rest was bland
I am not sure what the rave reviews are talking about but I do agree with the reviewer who said that they are cheap with the Tortillas
For 2 orders of guacamole we were given 1 small basket of chips
The decor is far from festive along with the music
My friends and I couldn't of had a better night had we not found ourselves in Burrito Loco
We had never heard of the place and we decided to take a chance
We were a party of seven, we each ordered a different dish and were plesantly surprised
I ordered the Tacos al Pastor with fresh chunks of pineapple and the dish has left my mouth salavating for more
The guacamole was prepared tableside to our taste and never had I tasted better guacamole
For dessert I ordered bananas flambee and it was delicious
At a very moderate price, and with very friendly service, we will surely return to burrito loco
ps: The mariachi music was lively and kept all our spirits bright, as did the festive paper cutouts that decorate the restaurant
Muy expensivo for mediocre food and zero ambience
One should be able to do much, much better in manhattan than this place
packed weeknights and weekends, burrito loco's downstair area is always hopping
Nice waiters, best guacamole, we keep on coming back for more!!
We had found this place through City Search and enjoyed ourselves very much
The food is great!
Ive been several times! For birthdays-to friends meeting up! Never had any problem! love the food and the prombt service all the time! Never had to wait to be seated! Great drinks too! Get Guacamole made right in front of you, and you can choose how spicy you want it! Wonderful Place great location! thay have room for large parties down stairs
I have visited Mexico many times and I've been to many different places but I have never eaten as well as in Burrit Loco
Its so authentic I'm afraid to drink the water
The Guacamole was made at the table and the Carne Tampquena was amazing
I can't wait to return
I can't believe Burrito is not rated in the top mexican category
Must be because its a small place and probably does little advertising
Best Mexican I've ever had
Forget Benny's Burritos, Rosa Mexicano, and all those other places with fake cheeze and sour beans, Burrito has truly tasty cuisine
Hands down, the best Mexican food in Manhattan
Generous portions (although a real serving of rice would have been nice) and excellent fare
Don't leave until you've had a cucaracha (flaming shot)
Guacamole carved and mixed fresh at your table
Not your average Mexican fare
Great family-run, clean feel
Plan on a 3 hour, laid-back, delicious affair
Fast service without rushing you
Don't let the tacky name or exterior fool you
This is a true gem
The quality of the food is excellent
The menu is creative and diverse
Order the Guacamole (they make it fresh at your table with a mortar and pestle)!  The margarita's were outstanding
Can't say enough good about this place, we'll definitely be back
Pitchers of sangria and frozen margaritas in every flavor possible, plus fantastic Mexican food at low prices
You can't go wrong with this restaurant -- it is a great place to go with big groups of friends
The Scene This modest, friendly destination places a premium on food rarely found in casual neighborhood joints
The space itself, with brick walls, fireplace and long wooden bar, has a slightly New England feel to it
Service is always warm and relaxed, and if you show up more than a few times, count on the bartender knowing your name
The Food Inventive nightly specials complement a menu stocked with dependable basics: roast chicken with garlic mashed potatoes, mixed green salad with marinated grilled steak, a variety of pastas and a worthy hamburger
The classics exhibit thoughtful touches as well: The grilled chicken club is enlivened with roasted red-pepper mayonnaise and arugula, and comes with homemade fries and coleslaw
Ate here last night with a table of 5
Tavern on Jane feels like a pub with locals chatting at the long bar, people squeezing past each other, it's casual and unpretentious
Don't let the pub-like atmosphere put you off - the food is excellent, and everything I tried was delicious
We shared the fried oyster appetizer and Thai spicy shrimp which were both very good
My main was the almond crusted Salmon special with Brussel sprouts and spinach, now this dish was perfect! Prices are well worth the food and if you can tolerate the noise, want somewhere with good service, friendly faces and are hungry don't wait another second
YUM!
We had a bonvoyage party for a friend the other evening and she recommended this place
It turns out that a lot of people weren't able to come at trhe same time, so we had so come and some go
At one point, everyone was sitting down in this casual atmosphere on a non-busy monday night and we had one exta person come in
we wanted to join another 2 top table to ours and the manager abruptly said, that won't work for us! I was surprised since we had been sitting there for an hour buying food and drinks, but we went on an enjoyed ourselves anyhow
for the company only because the burger was dry and the food was so so
The place was warm and cozy with very quick service
Don't know what the previous reviewer's remark about no fireplace was all about since we were seated right in front of a very nice warming fire which added to the ambience
The food was good and so was the wine
The food was excellent
The wine list was excellent and the waitress was very helpful in choice that went with each meal
There was no fireplace to cozy up to on the cold friday night that I was there, but that was okay because the quiant restaurant was nice for a first date
This place is amazing, I live close to it so I make a stop here with friends at least once a week
I am a sucker for their Hanger Steak (always cooked to perfection, never dry) and their Au Grat
Potatos! As said before, it's a beautiful cozy little tavern in a great location and for the food the prices are GREAT
Best spot in the city for casual dining as far as I'm concerned
If you're in the mood for a phenomenal burger in a super cozy West Village spot, this is it
I'll take their burgers over those at Corner Bistro - a scant 2 blocks away - any day
I know that's sacrilege to some, but seriously - nice toasted buns, cooked to perfection, amazing bacon, and great fries? What more could you want? More $$ than Corner Bistro, but WAAAAYYYYY better, all around
The staff is superfriendly, as is the neighborhood crowd, and the menu goes well beyond the burgers and fries you would expect from a tavern
They have daily specials (yummy - cobb salad) and some excellent wines along with drafts from the bar
And crayons are provided for the artist in you - more than once I have come away from a meal here with colorful meeting notes taken on the paper tableclothes
Although it gets crowded in a cozy way, and you can usually find a table without any trouble (in the back if you prefer to be away from the bar)
If you're into a sterile, cosmopolitan-touting crowd, this might not be the place for you, but if what you want is good food eaten to the nice lull of a happy crowd, get thee to Tavern on Jane
Went to tavern on jane on advice from this board but really didn't think the food was above average pub fare
hanger steak dry, fries were good but friend's rigatoni also too heavy
ambience and location, great, cozy and festive, but i wouldn't go for the food
First tried this place on September 12, 2001- a sad day for all but a good place to be- it lifted my spirits then and has done so every time I go back- which is often

I HAD TO BOOK A RESERVATION 4 WEEKS IN ADVANCE BUT IT WAS WELL WORTH IT! THEY PROMPTLY SEATED US ON TIME AND WE WERE SEATED IN THE BACK WHERE IT IS A LITTLE QUIETER
OUR SERVER WAS GREAT - HELPFUL AT ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND MAKING SUGGESTIONS! THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS
THEY ALSO HAVE A GREAT WINE LIST
THIS WAS A TRULY WONDERFUL DINING EXPERIENCE
I WLL DEFINITELY GO BACK!
In Short Open until two in the morning at least, and often later, Hat serves satisfying, reasonably priced Mexican food to a mixed crowd of L
E
S
locals and hungry club-goers
Burritos stuffed with beef, pork, avocado and various combinations thereof are the most popular; also available are enchiladas, tostadas and so forth
An assortment of entrees are offered as well: roast pork sauteed with oranges, shrimp fajitas and much more
the only time this place is worth stopping by is in the summer where you can get margaritas to go
other than that, i don't know what is the fascination that everyone has with this place? the food is crap!!! its not even mexican!! the staff is all puerto ricans and so is half their menu
(not good spanish food either
) i would rather go to bennys than here, and thats not saying much
for real mexican, go to the new place on houston, right off of clinton
This place is great
Very cheap Mexican food and plenty of it
Magaritas are delicious as well
The place is kinda dingy but who the heck cares
I am there for the food
YUM-MY we say! the chimas are PHENOM! worth the trip downtown -- and get a roadie for the ride home!
I don't understand the negative reviews here
I mean, it's yummy dirt-cheap, the service is friendly, it's open late, and the margaritas are enormous and dee-lish
Sure, it's not the most authentic Mexican food around, but what do you expect for a couple of bucks?
authentic delicious mexican food, and only one Margarita neccessary whowa !!!
this is the most disgusting mexican food in NY
the margarita's are great, but please don't eat
I used to promote this venue back in 03' and it was the place to be
the VIP room was serious
all sorts of celebs
the management has always been kinda stuck up
the bartenders are pretty cool and hook you up with the drinks
Fridays are cool but GET THERE EARLY because the line is crazy and you will end up paying $20 or more to get in but it's actually worth it when you get in
There's usually celebs or athletes hosting so that is why it gets so packed out but I guarantee you will enjoy yourself
Now I just coordinate parties and this is one of the venues that I book for my clients
I went there two years ago for my 21st b-day and i had a great time
I went again last weekend and it was horrible
RUDE is the word to describe everyone in this place
Especially the bartender
me and my friends were on a b-day guest list
before we went in i called the promoter through which we got a guest list and confirmed that it will be free for girls and guys before 11
we got in 10:40 and my bf had to pay $20
we were told that reg admission is $35-40
i dont know what they think they are to charge that much
it is not worth it
their 'open bar' was rum only
the line to the coat check was horribly long, it took us about 15 min to check our coats
nothing special, chose a different place
I am so surprised to see so many negative reviews here, because I LOVE this place! I always have good time here
The music is great, and there's room to dance or just lounge
But get there early, or be prepared to shell our $20 to get in
Worst NYC experience of my life
This place is so horrible that I had to sign up to CitySearch JUST to write a bad review
My friends and I went there last weekend for a bachelorette which was already supposed to be set up for us
The bride-to-be got in for FREE but everyone else was charged $25
When we voiced how ridiculous that was, the event coordinator basically told the bride-to-be to leave and take her friends with her because he didn't need our business, and whoever had already paid, even if they stayed for only 5 minutes, won't get their money back
Well guess what buddy, that's the last time this group of 30 would step into your place, and we'll make sure everyone else we know doesn't either
I highly NOT recommend this place if you want to have a good time in NYC
The staff is rude, the crowd is way too young and the drinks are way over priced
With all of the better options in the area skip this one
Was at Eugene's last Saturday night and had a BLAST! The lounge area's very mellow - the dance floor was packed
drinks were nice and strong
The people were awesome!!!! Definitely going back next week! ;)
THIS PLACE IS THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO
THE MUSIC IS HORRIBLE AND IF THE BOUNCERS WERE ANYMORE RUDER THEY SHOULD GET JOBS AS WARDENS
THE WAITRESSES TOLD US IF WE SAT DOWN AT A TABLE WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO THE BAR TO ORDER A DRINK! I WOULDNT GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN IF THEY PAID ME AND NEITHER SHOULD ANYONE ELSE
Ok, so not everyone in NY is intelligent
I give you that but how can a place like Eugene's exist? The staff is completely rude, the security is anything but and to push back a party that was GUARANTEED in advance some two weeks prior! Eugene's should be ashamed of how they treated our group
The event coordinator gave no courtesy to our group of 60 plus people and didn't notify us of THEIR change in plans in advance or upon arrival, let alone apologize to us
So if you are looking for an amazing night that is going to be fun with all your friends, I can pretty much recommend any place but Eugene's, but if you like staff who doesn't comply to the dress code and outrageous prices for drinks that aren't that great
Eugene's is your place
Have fun and say hi to the event staff for me!
I stood in line to get into Eugene's for the party discussed above and it was A NIGHTMARE
We were treated extremely rude by the staff as we waited in line; then, were ultimately told to leave
I will NEVER go to Eugene's again!
If your looking for a good place to have a great time with some friends, you won't find it at Eugene's
This place really sucks not to mention the pack of hungry bouncers giving you attitude at the door! I tried to attend a party there and it will be the last time I step foot anywhere near there unwelcomig doors
Terrible Service and Outrageous Attitude
Confirmed a party there two weeks prior to the event, only to be REFUSED ENTRANCE upon arrival at door
If dealing with an Incredibly INCOMPETENT, cocky event coordinator is your thing, you can find him at Eugene's
I never knew that Eugene served dinner til I went there for a friend's bday party on Saturday
In any case, they have a dinner deal that's a really good value
$40 for three courses and unlimited wine by the glass
The food wasn't anything amazing, but was pretty decent for the price
Plus you also bypass the $20 cover you would otherwise have to pay
I've been there numerous times and the music is always pretty good and it's a fun scene
The crowd is a bit on the BT side, but overall, it's pretty easy to have a good time and there's a decent number of cute girls
My only complaints are that the dance floor is pretty small and it took a while to get seated for dinner and served
Definitely a great place to be
Was there for a party and the staff was very accomodating and professional
Food is light, but good
Dance floor was definitely adequate
Down-stairs to bathroom not fun, but good staff inside
Place is decked out awesome
Hang out in the old-time curved tables in the wall, or the loungey chairs
GO!
I went on a Friday and got in for $5, so there are deals out there
I also went with a fun group so we just had a great time
The music was mostly hip-hop all night

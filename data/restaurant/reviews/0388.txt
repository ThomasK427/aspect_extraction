The French owner has a real attitude and treats his staff and patrons as if they are below him
The one nice bartender that used to work there is apparently gone and everyone else seems to have a real attitude problem
The drinks are overpriced and the food portions are for a bird
I have had better experiences at Taco Bell
Don't GO!!
The food was fine, but not outstanding
Creative, but nothing that can't be had elsewhere in the city, and the presentation seems a (failed) effort to conceal the fact that the portions are quite small
The seating area is fun, though I certainly wouldn't call it romantic
It is a bit loud, and the tables of wanna-be hipsters making as much noise as possible in order to be noticed didn't help
In as city as lavish and lovely as NYC this place is a dud in the rough! I took my fiancee here for his birthday
Although we had reservations we waited one hour for a table when the place was practically empty
The food is good but it is overly she-she and way OVERPRICED
Not to mention the portions are miniscule
Do not call something an entree if it is the size of a tapas plate
Especially when you're paying top dollar for it
The steak is $26 and you get 5 thin slices and 6 potato wedged french fries
That's it! The rest of the dishes are exactly the same
Overdone and overpriced
Your $$$ and evening is much better spent at Asia De Cuba where the food, atmosphere, and price are all top notch
After reading some of the other reviews, we were hesitant to try the restaurant but went anyway
I was pleasantly surprised by the food the service
We did wait a little while to get seated even though there were tables available, but the Grotto was a unique ambiance and we really enjoyed it
The food was of mixed quality, but the ceviches and fish were excellent (avoid the cold leek soup)
I have been to Suba 3 times since it opened, and have to say that it is getting better all the time
Food is outstanding, esp
for reasonable prices
Not pretentious or chi-chi, but good and plentiful
Service is much better than in any other fashionable downtown restaurant I have been to
Only downside is noise and it is a bit crowded, but then you expect that downtown and it's part of the vibe
Overall, it's worth the trip
several times
Forget about the service (which is bad), and forget about the food (which is worse)
What's going on with the cramped seating? Our dining room was only half full, yet we were forecd to share a table with complete strangers
We had reservations, and so did the strangers, and yet the management claimed the other tables were reserved
No one ever came to eat at those tables
After eating an unpleasant $150 microwave dinner for two, we won't be going back
Suba is a great place to hang out and have a drink, but its far from a culinary classic
The overly long wait for a table (with reservation) was partially subdued by being seated in the grotto, which is a cool concept, but isnt nearly as appealing as it sounds
The menu is inventive, but the overall flavors seem to come up short
Its far from a bad meal, but for great food, go elsewhere
Just had a great dinner on Thursday nite at Suba
Went with my girlfriend for our one-year anniversary and needed a special place for dinner
This was it
The service was incredible, probably the best I've ever had
The Grotto is an amazing dining area and it is 100% romantic
Had the 4 course tasting menu, plus dessert, great choices by the chef, left full
One of the owners helped pick a bottle of wine and practically gave us a wine class
If i had to give one negative, I would say that because the service is so good, it almost seemed like the meal was being rushed a bit
But that was very minor
Great meal, I will be back to Suba
I just had the best dinner of my life! I went with my boyfriend and everybody treeted us really well
the hostess, waiter, manager EVEN THE BUSBOYS! every body knew their job and were very profesional I'm spanish and I had better tapas at suba then in my own home town, Valencia
We ate in the grotto and it was beautiful, so romantic, and the music was great
The food was also great! You have to get the Monkfish ceviche and the Tuna, REALLY GOOD AND TASTY! They also have the best spanish wines and the waiter knew them very well! GO TO SUBA!!!! I know I'll be back!!!!
This place is sexy, perfect for the third date if you know what I mean
Stepping inside was a shock; gorgeous space- even before we got to the room surrounded by water
The staff gave us a friendly greeting, good music, overall great fun vibe
We had drinks upstairs before dinner, the cocktails were luscious and original, I wanted to taste ALL of them
The only thing better was the bottle of wine we had with dinnergreat recommendation from our waiter, who was sexy and spanish, like the wine
Sumptuous food, we shared several different dishes, each distinct and well balanced and frankly just mmmm
We were satisfied even before dessert, but that melted chocolate thing was a must
The only thing more satisfying would have been a couple of desserts to take home
Deserts for after our at home dessert mmmm
Thank you Suba for a great time
In a neighboorhood growing with trendy bars, Suba pretty much follows suit
The small Tapas bar on the first level serves refreshing drinks where you can get have a small group together to hang out and pick from a limited tapas menu
The drinks were good and the bartenders friendly (he even apologized for the wait)
The food here is nothing to write home about
Calamari special appetizer was tasty but tiny portion
Tuna was well over cooked, Duck was adequate
Nice ambiance but noisy in the grotto room
too dark in the skylight room
a good place to meet up for drinks but nothing more
you can see the moat on your way to the bathroom but don't stay to eat
The entire hostess staff was very nice friendly
I loved our waiter last night, unfortunately I didn't catch his name
He was patient, professional efficient
And of course, the grotto dining room was amazing
Who knew I'd be so impressed by a little water?! It made my dining experience here worth it
My gripe is the food did not match the quality of the decor
Although the chef was kind enough to give me an extra appetizer when I sent back my steak which was way overcooked
A bunch of my gal pals went here thinking it would be a good tapas place, as it is advertised, but we got the menu and Surprise! no tapas! we were disappointed but the food we ordered was good
Change your logo!
Making a reservation was one of the worst dinner ideas I've had
First, the seating people gave me huge attitude and claimed I had not reserved a table at the grotto - and I quote my reservation You are all set for the grotta this saturday
Then we waited quietly for 15 minutes until it was well after our reservation time
I asked what was going on, and the hostess tried to argue about what time it was
Wow, what a ridiculous scene

the place oozes wannabe
We left and had delicious crepes down the street
If you are looking for loud, obnoxious, with a lot of attitude, you have the right place
Don't bother with reservations
My first dinner at Suba was such a delight
The decor is beautiful! We were able to sit in the Grotto and it has a great feel when you want to have a nice, tranquil dinner
The food was excellent as well as the service (thank you Rafael!)
I didn't want to leave, but all good things must come to an end
That atmosphere was cool, but it stopped there
The food was okay and the service was terrible
They brought out the wrong appetizer 3 times and cooked the flank steak medium well instead of medium rare

Kudos to Alex and his entire staff for a great dining experience!
The Scene There's a rough-hewn aspect to the decor, from the scruffed wood floors to the curving patchwork leather wall that swoops from the entrance to the dining area in the rear, where a civilized crowd of foodies and their dressed-up companions gather
An all-glass wine loft perched above adds drama
Service is professional and informed
The Food The menu is entirely a la carte and diners choose a cooking method--braising or roasting, for instance--and an ingredient, such as soft-shell crab or sweetbreads; each dish is then put in the center of the table to be shared
The kitchen's strength lies in its braised dishes, such as bone-in lamb shank and buttery ramps
Exceptionally fresh, high-quality ingredients elevate dishes like roasted hen of the wood mushrooms and a simple, innovative octopus terrine dotted with preserved lemon
Desserts are excellent, especially a near-perfect apple tarte Tatin
Craft is indeed a wonderful restaurant
Beautifully decorated, the wait staff is top notch, and the menu is deceptively simple
Each course has a listing of servings but no description of how the meal is prepared short of roasted or braised
Our server was very knowledgable and we were very glad we asked for descriptions
Something as simple as braised swordfish
was in reality braised swordfish in duck fat with pancetta
I was a bit surprised that MOST if not all of the seafood offerings were prepared in this manner (with some type of meat associated with it)
So if you are a vegetarian be sure to ASK questions, the staff is very friendly and eager to assist
The sides are deving particularly the Summer Pea Cavatelli
Wow! And for desert I cannot recommend the doughnuts highly enough
A class act
A wonderful restaurant, with genuinely wonderful food: simple, sumptuous, subtle
The braised foie gras first plate is to die for (the best I have ever had outside of Paris), and the Hen of the Wood mushrooms are succulent and pungent
The fish (we had the swordfish and the hamachi) are, to be quite honest, totally forgettable, but the sides and the appetizers are so strong that they carry the meal
Only drawback was that we were rushed a bit through our lovely first courses into the second courses that were waiting in the wings--my entree was in fact set down while I was still finishing my appetizer
Next time I go I'll be stacking up on appetizers and sides!
Warm ambience, friendly and unobtrusive service, and on top of it all: beautifully-prepared food that really makes the featured ingredient shine
If you can, splurge for the Porterhouse for 2 -- the filet meat will make you swoon with joy
I loved the apple crepes for dessert, but everything is fantastic, really
Only small complaint was that we were seated next to the main entrance -- since we had an early service there were waiters that had little to do but hang around at our corner of the restaurant
They were polite and all, but it was a little distracting
Went last night for the first time and was very pleased
I got a reservation day of on line, and they seated us immediately
We shared the grilled octopus and the beet salad for apps--thanks all for the octopus reccomendations--it was amazing
Charred, smoky, perfectly cooked
For dinner, we had the striped bass, scallops, green asparagus and hen of the woods mushrooms
The fish and scallops were perfectly cooked and extremely fresh
The asparagus was delicious and the mushrooms were out of this world delicious
The roasting had condensed the flavors
Come for simple food, perfectly prepared
We were more than satisfied with the portions
It's a gourmet restaurant
not TGI Fridays people! Service was great throughout ordering, although they did get a little disorganized when the big dinner rush hit
Overall, it was a great experience, delicious food and I would go again
I don't understand the high reviews
Nearly every dish our group of 4 had was a huge dissappointment
Mushroom risotto tasted of nothing but salt (and tiny for $16!), sirloin was $50 and bland with more fat than I have seen before
Waiter was very arrogant, though tha staff was attentive and when a waiter pilled a glass of water on one of our guests, the hostess ran with a dry cleaning voucher even though we did not make a big deak of it - just an accident and only water
Shocking what they charge for below average food
I was there with 2 friends
One was running late and I didnt think theyll seat us until she arrived
They seated us promptly and took appetizer order
Our waitress was familiar with menu and wine list
I ordered Foie Gras Torrine appetizer -- unbelievably delicious
Main course was good, but nothing extraordinary, some dishes were too salty
Wines by the glass, had good variety for fish but not meat
Deserts were good, but decaffeinated espresso was awful
Regular wasnt great either
I was unable to eat most of my fish after splurging on appetizers and my friend (who arrived on time) could not finish her meat
Our waiter packed it to go and returned with a coat check tag to pick it up on way out
I found this very impressive
However, later we realized that they put my fish and her meat in one dish
My fiancee took me to Craft last night for my birthday
We had an incredible dinner
The wine selection is top notch, and the bottle of '97 Heitz we had was perfect with the perfectly cooked venison we both enjoyed
And when they tossed our leftovers in the garbage by accident, they cooked us a whole new tenderloin! I was stunned-no restuarant has ever offered to do that
Craft is top notch-from the food, to the wine, to the service
To echo the sentiments of past reviews, the experience of Craft was pleasant but lacked innovation
Every dish we had was mediocre with the exception of the scallops, which were excellent
The most disappointing portion of our meal were the roasted porcini mushrooms, which could be likened to store bought mushrooms in teriyaki sauce
The wine, along with the service, was excellent but given the prosaic dishes, my $300 could've been well spent somewhere else
Beautiful Decor, excellent service and wine list
The food is rather bland
If you are looking for a great atmospheric place its well worth checking out
Expect fanstastic wine, service, but not the best food
Took my wife for dinner expecting great things
Ended up very disappointed
Service was great but food was uncreative, salty and boring! The food was either broiled or grilled
There were no sauces or additions to bring out flavor of the meats or dishes
Prices were outrageous
Craft reminded me of an extremely expensive steakhouse
We order sides which ranged from $17 to $22
$22!!! for a plate of mushrooms
Dessert were the same, lacked creativity and taste
Come on Craft
You really let me down! Good service though
It is an excelent restaurant, the service is out of this world
There seems to be good communication amogst the staff and that gives a very good impression
Managers are very helpful and very service oriented
It is a great place to spend a wonderful time
One of my favorite spaces
The chef has a great menu and pretty good wine list
The venison is one of my favorites in the city
Good date spot - definitely worth coming back to
This place is great - especially the desserts! Highly recommended
The food at Craft is simple and flavorful, not overwhelmed by too much sauce
The chef strives to highlight the beauty in the food
The roasted monkfish was perfect
The wine selection is rather extensive
visited on v-day, 2/14/05
first of all, the citysearch write-up is wrong
main dishes are served individually, not in the middle to share (though the side dishes are)

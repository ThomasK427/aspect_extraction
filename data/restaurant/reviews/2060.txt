The Food This traditional Italian menu serves up solid renditions of the classics
Start with any of the refreshing salads, from the traditional caprese made with fresh mozzarella to a tangy carpaccio di salmone
The primi piatti are the real deal: Al dente ravioli and papardelle arrive in generous helpings laden with carefully seasoned sauces
Meat and salmon entrees are beautifully presented, adorned with exquisite sauces
The subsequent creamy tiramisu and fluffy apple tart are definitely worthwhile
You will no doubt impress your friends if you bring them to Da Andrea
The location in greenwich village is always lots of fun, and inside the restaurant is very cozy
Prices are extremely reasonable
considering how amazing the food is, i have easily paid double or triple what i have paid at da andrea and not gotten nearly as good food
i recommend the pasta dishes, esp the papardelle with sausage ragout and the gnocchi with pesto
desserts are also wonderful
HONESTLY SPEAKING GO AND TRY IT !! Superb friendly atmosphere,delicious dishes,a lot of flavor and a small reasonable wine list ( maybe more selections in that price range would give people more to choose from ,but it's ok )
warm charming simply the greatest Italian RISTORANTE IN NEW YORK !!!  NO KIDDING !!!
The ambience is great, best part of town for a great quaint restaurant, walked in off the street were seated immediately
Wine list was great, bread foccacia were excellent
however the pasta (of all things) was very subpar
Usually I wouldn't make this complaint but my food was scalding
to the point of having to wait a good 5mins before even gingerly touching it, further we ordered the bolognase and there was litteraly 20 strands of spaghetti more than smotthered in meat sauce
We definetly needed more pasta
Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing
I have been to many restaurants in the city, but this one takes the cake
such friendly service, and food
wow
Homemade and delicious
I have taken a party of 6 there and it only cost me around $140
Where in NYC can you find that
Not to mention huge portions, and a very affordable winelist
I have brought many people there and they all say the same
Da Andrea, you have won yourself another loyal customer
Oh1 you must try the warm Zabaigone with berries for dessert, out of this world!!
I'm a chef (30 years), and I can honestly say that I've finally found Italian food worth eating at a reasonable price
I can compare it to my home town in Firenze
When I first visited this busy little eatery I was astounded at how well I was received
The Bolognese was exactly like home
The Polipo was perfectly tender and flavorful
I enjoyed my main course of Sweatbreads immensely
I'm always bringing back someone new, and trying something new
Even my mother loved it
I have to give my hat to the Chef/owner of Da Andrea
Ask yourself this
How many Italian restaurants have actual Italians eating there constantly? This one does, with 1 or 2 notible chefs having dinner there as well
A plane ride to Italy is at least 8 hours long, but here a 15-20 minute wait for food from Italy is definately worth the wait
I am from Bologna , I have been living in the village for the last seven years and this is the best italian food you can find around new york
all the pasta is unbelievable!!!!
After my meal there and after reading the reviews below, I have to agree with the 'you can't live on bread wine alone' post listed below
my sentiments exactly
The food here for myself and my companion was just terrible
Bland pastas
and a really below standard Bolognese sauce
I was shocked
And the staff was not accomodating and just outright rude
We had been recommended to go here by other neighborhood NYC'ers, but I cannot recommend this restaurant for an enjoyable Italian meal at all
this little place serve the best home made pastas, sauces and dishes , the portion are very generous , great wines , everyone i bring to this place are impress, the service is very friendly , this guys make everything fresh every day , you can tell, from appetizer to dessert you really feel the passion of the chefs , 2 great italian guys
The focaccia is excellent, keep up the good work

We went out of our way a bit to try this place, based on the reviews on this site
The service and welcoming attitude and prices were nice, but the Spagetti Bolognaise tasted like something out of a school cafeteria - I could swear the ground beef was from a can - how can you mess up spag bol??   The other food was ok - the cavetelli with pesto and the papardelle with sausage - but wasn't as warm as we expected
The tiramisu was really nice - the apple tart was ok, a bit soft on the crust and not very warm
In the end, I guess we won't be back - the atmosphere wasn't really that impressive and the food was even less so
I can find affordable (and better tasting) Italian closer to my neighborhood
I'm italian and this woud be my favorite restaurant also in Italy
Their dishes are delicious, really authentic and abundant
The staff is absolutly professional but also very friendly
I feel at home over there
And
it's not even expensive!
It's the best italian food in the city - hands down
a friend and i were wandering down hudson trying to find a place to have dinner, and stumbled in here
There was a relatively long wait, but we couldn't bear to leave since the aroma of the cooking food was so enticing
Our 30-ish minute wait was well worth it
The house red is a fantastic montepuciano the pastas are fresh, the servers all have great attitudes, and best of all, it's relatively cheap! not much to speak of in terms of decor, but you forget about that when your food comes!
GF and I was wandering around late in Westside and happen to find this restaurant and thought we try the food
Overall, amazing Italian food, especially the mussels and white tuna dish
Both of us had appetizer, main dish, and wine and total was only around $60
For this quality of food, that's simply amazing
We will come here again and again and again
You gotta love this place
When they have it, the potato-leek puree soup is absolutely amazing
You really have to have the pappardele with sausage and truffle oil ragu
It tastes even better than it sounds
The veal shank is also quite good
The foccacia is homemade and quite addictive
I really can't say enough about this place
Oh yeah! IT'S REALLY INEXPENSIVE TOO!!!!! Go already!
When I came to this restaurant for the first time I immediately felt at home
A warm and cordial ambience, delicious dishes and really good wine brings a moiety of Italy to you
Whenever I go there I always feel welcome
I hesitate to praise too much, because it's already hard enough to get in -- but this is my favorite village restaurant
From the moment you walk in, both the staff and owners make you feel completely at home
Plus the food is very good, in a comfort food type of way
Prices are great, too
Dinner last night was pretty disappointing
We all had pasta, but no one loved theirs
I had the gnocchietti with gorgonzola and arugula, but the gnocchi were pasty, there was too much sauce, and too much of one taste
The kids were happy with the spaghetti bolognese, but the cavatelli with seafood was overwhelmed by the pesto sauce
Lovely apple tart, nice service, good wine by the glass, including Prosecco, my favorite
It is inexpensive - pastas around $10, so I can't be too critical
You can't go wrong with that place
It has great Italian food for reasonable prices
The atmosphere is nice and the owners and the staff are very sweet

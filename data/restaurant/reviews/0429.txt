I've never had a bad meal there - the duck panini is my favorite dinner in the city
On the service side, some of the waiters are friendlier than others but, on the whole, it's one of the more welcoming waitstaffs I've encountered in the city
We picked this place because it got good reviews on Citysearch
I wish we haven't, the place looks like grandfather's garage or a tools shed
It has old cracking paint on the outside and is very narrow and small
Even though you can seat outside in the back, you get the feeling of being in an old backyard, not a restaurant
If you're looking for a place that looks appealing, this is not the place to go
Moreover, when we came there was ONE couple in a whole place, but we were pretentiously asked by the staff whether we have reservations
In addition, the grandfather's garage insists on charging the same substantial prices as some really impressive in appearance restaurants
With all the choices of restaurants in Manhattan this will not be the one on my list
i have eaten here twice
food was solid, but menu was a little bit limited
an interesting menu of different chocolates was a great way to end one meal
the garden is FABULOUS on a nice day
fantastic atmosphere - the garden is by far one of the best and most romantic in the city
the food was right on par with the atmosphere - fois gras is to die for
curently my new favorite restaurant in the city
Very good food at very reasonable prices! Friendly service
Love it!
This is truly on of my favorite finds in NYC
The food is incredible, the wine list always interesting
The garden is a true paradise on earth
I have not found a garden that is more charming and takes you completely out of NYC
Cute place
Good food and prices, although they are really serving panini the french way
I encountered too much attitude from our server
The Scene The Excellent Pork Chop House may be downscale, but it isn't a dive: While everything is unapologetically economical (fluorescents, linoleum, Styrofoam), it's also spotless, cheerful and user-friendly
A photo album of all the dishes makes ordering a breeze, even for neophytes
The Food The pork chop, as advertised, is indeed excellent
Lightly coated with spices, greaselessly fried and juicy, the top-billed porcine delicacy shows up over rice (with pickled cabbage and ground pork), with a bowl of noodle soup or all alone on a plate, as a side dish
Start off your meal with tasty cold dishes like seaweed salad and pickled cucumbers, or branch out to a fried chicken leg or fish ball soup
For dessert, pick your own toppings for Taiwanese shaved ice--a kind of Asian Sno-Cone, covered with goodies
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers, right off of Pell St (barber's alley) in Chinatown
The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered
The cuisine from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese, though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked
Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown
The restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese
If you're not familiar with the cuisine, you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don't accept credit cards
If you are in Chinatown, and you are hungary for some Authentic Taiwanese street food for cheap price, this place is it
In addition to the pork chop or chicken leg over rice, be sure to check out their very good lomein noodles
Can't go wrong with that cheap price, either
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre
You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown
They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town! Beef noodle soup is good as well
The service is good and the resturant is clean
Best Taiwanese food in NY!
Authentic Taiwanese dishes
Excellent value, friendly service, and comforting food
Not much variety to choose from but defnitely worth a visit
Try the namesake
I have been here 5 times and never ordered anything but the porkchop over rice
Plus, the display case along the back wall has some of the most authentic kitsch I have seen in C-town
Authentic Taiwanese food that's cheap
what more could you ask for? (Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city)
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan
outstanding food
atmosphere was warm and inviting
the staff was knowledgable
i had a cheese fondue as my starter dish and it was fun and delicious, my entree was a seared tuna with grilled vegetables, and I finished off with an assorted fruit platter with some nice dessert wine
Coconut shrimp are outstanding
Otherwise, the menu is reliable but not very exciting
Expensive for a merely adequate experience
I've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited
This time, I prefer not to go into detail
I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy's Bronx, or for that matter, Jimmy's Uptown, again
Not only would I not recommend Jimmy's restaurants to friends, I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience
Jimmy is Dominican! Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny
If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here
Would NEVER go back there
Too bad Latin Quarters closed
That place was awesome,,,  sally !
People who work or own the restaurant add their own ratings too
This is the worst restaurant I've been
Of course I have really been to worse ones, but not on this $25 per person charge
Noisy beyond belief, does not even have the Patio anymore (outside tables with a view)
They sell you souvenirs inside the bathroom!, you hear 2 different very LOUD music coming from the bar and the restaurant itself that barely lets you talk, and the food is average at the most, not bad, but you get better anywhere else for that price
I went with my girlfriend there on our first date, bad, bad, bad choice
Dress is not casual, you look out of sync casual, everyone dresses worse
Service has a smile? they poured beer on the table, got stupid to get a taxi
uneducated to say the least
Forget it
Jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx
Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city
Good food at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date)
After dinner, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY
Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's
Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady)
Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays
The service is fantastic
The food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible
But trust me it is so worth it
If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$$ this is the place to be!! Picture this: as u walk in your greeted by a doorman and pictures and frames of BIG PUNS CLOTHES to the right is the TAKE OUT and to the left are the VIDEO GAMES and to the far back is the CLUB and straight ahead is the RESTAURANT with a grand scenary through their blinds of a GASTERIA and CORNER STORE (bodega)
And top the night with the lovly sounds of Hip-Hop at the dinning area while RB and Merengue blasts on the dance floor just 10 feet way and being heard all at the same time
One of the best Roti Spots in Brooklyn! Pholurie Doubles are excellent! Ali's gives you a back-home type of feel

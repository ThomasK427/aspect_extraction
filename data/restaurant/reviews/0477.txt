Icon feeds the red-eyed denizens of this permanent midnight
Red velvet banquettes make the minimal seem lush in a long, granite-flooreddining room, leading to the only point of day--the light-filled patio room
The midtown clientele isn't all immaculately disheveled: Business suits dot the landscape any time of morning, noon and night
The Food Icon sports the usual high-quality hotel breakfast (applewood smoked bacon, brioche French toast, egg white omelette), organizing everything on a meticulous black leather menu
Later in the day, seafood comes first for chef Brian Wieler
The somewhat curt, almost identicallunch and dinner menus contain sea-dredged goodies like crisp fried oysters, delicate peekytoe crab salad, and plump roasted sea scallops
For land lovers, soft, buttery mashed potatoes frame succulent hunks of pan-roasted chicken in a honey-sweet sauce
The W hotel is always a place for class and service and Icon is no exception
The ambiance is warm and inviting and the service is absolutley impeccable
The food was outstanding and we had homeade donut munchkin type things for dessert
I don't eat donuts but and these were absolutely devine
We were seated next to Nia Long too so I got a little star struck
:-)
I just have to say that ICON was supberb
I had my hesitations about going to another hotel restaurant, but I have to admit that they quickly changed my mind
I haven't dined there since the disappearance of Myriad Restuarant Group and thought that it would change it forever
Needless to say, that my company had a dinner reservation for this past Thursday October 13th, we had a rather large table with a very important time restraint
It all started with the GM of the restaurant Marisa who we know use to be the asst chef and the servers of George, Rashid, Hisham, and Stephanie
You are all excellent and I can't wait to come back again
If anyone has any second guesses about going to a restaurant that they use to enjoy but changed hands, please think again
You never know what you are going to miss
Bon Appetite!
Last week, my girlfriend and I stopped by ICON, thinking we were only going to check out the spot and have a few drinks
After living in NYC for 7 years and working in Murray Hill for 5 years, I have now found my favorite spot to wine and dine
The bartender Marla was fabulous, she had us laughing
After sitting there for about an hour, we decided to check out the menu and sit down for dinner in a lovely red velvet covered banquette
By the way did I mention how heavenly this was? From the way the manager at the desk (name starts with a M, short hair) to Marla the bartender, to Kendall our server
The food was excellent, the service was outstanding, and the drinks are a hit
I strobgly recommend this restaurant to all of my friends
Great restaurant to go for a special, romantic occassion
The service is impeccable, food is good and the atmosphere is dark and inviting
Go there for an anniversary or just for a special night out
When i first heard about this place I wasnt too excited to go
but its now one of my local favs  The JUMBO (and I mean large) shrimp cocktail the Calamari in the Hoisin bbq (OH YAH -- this is my FAV) Rocks  They do have a year round price fixed dinner (and usually its a pretty good deal, with pretty good choices)  And you can slide over to the other W-hotel bars and lounges
works out to be pretty great food, with a good decore  and if you make reservations they can do large groups (20+) but otherwise it isnt that hard to get a table
This restaurant has perfect food, ambience, and silverware
The staff is as beautiful as the cocktails
Allison is my favorite
My partner and I come here twice a month and always have a lovely time
Had dinner on a Tuesday night
The food was delicious and just the right portions so that you can have an appetizer, an entree, a dessert and a drink without feeling overstuffed
The service was attentive and the dining experience was overall very enjoyable
However, if what I saw was indicative of daily business and clientele, you should not go in the hopes of trying to impress an out-of-towner of a happening and hip restaurant
While it was nice to be able to have a quiet conversation, the place was practically empty and unhappening
Maybe it was because it was a weeknight?
Space and atmosphere is good, but food is barely eatable
Carrot soup was way too bitter
Black ravioli tasteless and fish too greasy
As for desert I had what was suppose to be lemon cake and I was broth something that resembled angle cake with frozen blueberries and ice-cream
99% of the time, i am satisfied with the high rated restaurants on citysearch
This restaurant was a 9+ so, it must be good, i guess that 1% of the time kicked in
The food proportion was small, and i asked for a well-done steak, what did i get, bloody steak
The waitress has an attitude problem and the server kept bumping into me or one of my friends
I was really disappointed
My wife and I have eaten at ICON twice and both experiences were good
Yes it is expensive but the food is top notch
Last weekend when we ate there, I got the Prix Fare which was a duck dish that was good but not spectacular
My wife ordered the Rib Eye steak which was fabulous
Still my favorite part of the restaurant and bar adjacent are the drinks
Have a great time!!
Went for Restaurant Week and was disappointed in the limited selection for the prix fixed menu
Only two selections per course
Nothing caught my eye, so opting for the regular menu turned out to be good idea
Appetizers: those that we tried were good, though skip the soup, cuz you can eat that at home since it tasted like Campbells
Entre: the cuts of meat were all well prepared; no complaints there
Recommended: friend oyster appetizer and the short rib entre
The staff service was fair; they were not exceedingly attentive nor did we feel neglected (except when it was hard to find the waitress to pay for the check)
The atmosphere is laid-back and the best part of it would be the bar/lounge that is located in the same hotel, which would be a great place to hit to grab some after dinner drinks with a date
Just went for January 2003 Restaurant Week
Setting is okay -- trying for dramatic, but just seemed really noisy
Food was pretty good
New American -- nothing fancy, just your usual grilled stuff with interesting veggies on a big plate
Decently prepared food
Prices are moderate to expensive
Nice attentive service
The desserts were tasty! Grab the chocolate chip warm bread pudding if you can!
My girlfriend and I went last night, and we had a great time, the food was great, and the service, excellent
Everyone was super friendly, and very attentive
We sat out by the deck, which was nice because it was quiet, but you felt disconnected
But i would definatlely visit Icon Again
Good food and nice ambience
A bit brighter than I would have expected and the portions were a bit smaller
Had dinner on a Friday night
It was spectacular
from the atmosphere, which was not only beautiful but hip to the great but not snobbish servce and varied but reasonably priced menu
No problem taking a vegtarian here as well
My boyfriend I had a very romantic dinner here
It was wonderful from start to finish
The setting was dark intimate, the food was spectacular the service was the icing on the cake
We'll be back in the future!
Great food, drinks service
We ate had cocktails in the little garden tonight had a really good time
Thanks!
I have lived in Murray Hill for 3 years, yet just discovered Icon last week on the recommendation of a colleague
Icon is hidden within the W Court hotel on E
39th- blink you'll miss it -but when you do find it you won't be disapointed! The food was great, simple unintimidating
The service was friendly but unintrusive I never had to ask for anything
The atmosphere was both romantic electric
It was an evening I won't soon forget
It's my new favorite spot in the neighborhood!

Either my group was not as important as the people who were at our table or Jack's is completely disorganized
Management made no effort to speed the departure of the other party
Nor did they offer us a drink or some appetizers at their mini-bar, as is customary in such a situation
Avoid Jack's - go to the Mermaid Inn around the corner instead
I went to Jack's after making reservations weeks in advance
The day of Jack's we were called and the reservation was pushed back 1/2 hour
No biggie
When we arrived at Jack's we were immediately asked to wait yet another half hour
What?! The small bar at Jack's was full so we had to leave the building altogether
After 30 minutes we again returned to Jack's
Sorry, it will be at least another 30 minutes, this table sat down 3
5 hours ago and are lingering
And you can't help us in any way? No
No offers were made to help our situation, the hostess was utterly hopeless
We decided to pass on Jack's altogether because it was late into the night and we wanted dinner
Jack's is the worst case of unprofessionalism I've ever witnessed
I don't recommend it to anyone unless you want an exercise in frustration and hunger
Remember the name: Allison Vines-Rushing a Chef to watch
From her current (and miniscule!) open kitchen at Jacks we enjoy the true and rare pleasure of a genius in its early flower
Amazing to watch her cook, the house full, keeping her whites spotless and her smile generous (and, yes, beautiful too)
Jacks is a quirky and highly individual vision
How refreshing: no prepackaged theme here
Chef refines her deep American South experience with grace, exactitude, consistency, and classical intelligence: dishes commonly grotesque (like Oysters Rockefeller or Bananas Foster) she recreates in her own manner, with spectacular results
Crab and celeriac soup is lovely, flavors soothing and full, yet light - a representative success
Portion sizes are correct
The staff is accomplished and the owners unfailingly solicitous, enthusiastic and obviously seasoned restauranteurs
Go: and be one of the few who will remember Chef Vines-Rushing way back when


$400 and 4 hours later, the two of us left famished and ran out to a bistro down the street for an actual meal
Sure, Jack's is a cute concept -- Like eating in the living room of an old friend (except with exquisitely UNCOMFORTABLE furniture)
We had the tasting menu -- which was not a meal!!!!
I am a small framed woman, and I felt as though I was being fed an incredibly drawn out appetizer course
I'm sorry, but one oyster is not a course!!!! Nor is ONE shrimp, ONE langoustine, and a tiny bowl of soup!!!! Jack's is a cute concept -- but it is not a restaurant!!!! Do not go hungry!!! -- Go to enjoy the first rate wine and the homey feel -- but eat somewhere else first!!!!
Jack's feels like a cozy wedding reception put on by newfound acquaintences
The husband and wife proprietors give a warm feel to chilled oysters and gargantuan shrimp cocktail (warning: the heads are still attached
But don't let that stop you bc the shrimp are excellent)
Champagne is prominent on the menu, but expensive
$2 oysters, $4 jumbo shrimp-- reasonable given the quality
Best of all is the couple's attention to detail
Everything is picture perfect, right down to the little bronze frog who holds your check in his mouth
The Scene The bright, small space has a takeout counter and stools up front, a cheery, brick-walled dining room in back, and a bustling, spotless open kitchen in the middle where two glowing pizza ovens work double-time
The staff--like most of the clientele--is young and chipper, a welcome change from the usual monosyllables of the corner slice joint
The Food Pinch is hardly a standard pizza-by-the-slice parlor
Instead, the thin-crusted pies are baked in long rectangular strips and customers order it--you guessed it--by the inch
The crust is nicely crisp and chewy, while the mild red sauce and goopy cheese are best matched with kicky toppings like pepperoni, cut in thin sticks for easier eating, and fiery fresh red chilies or hot Italian sausage
Smart entrees excel: House-made fettuccine is thick-cut and toothsome, tossed with pancetta and peas; golden chicken-under-a-brick marries well with braised escarole and whole roasted garlic cloves
I would rather spend the bucks at Pinch than go to places like 33rd and 3rd any day
When you go in you are immediately greeted by the friendly owners, who treat you like you're a regular customer even if you go in once in a while, and the waitresses are so nice, too
The pizzas are delicious - my personal favorite is with breadcrumbs and olive oil - and the pastas are amazing, too
Next time I go I need to try their homemade gelatto
This place has the BEST thin crust pizza
The white pizza is out-of-this-world! The arugula salad was the best I've ever had in the city
This pizza place is a MUST TRY!
I like the idea of pizza being cut the way YOU want it to be cut
The price you pay for the thin inches of pizza you get is ludicrousespecially considering it tastes like pizza you can get in the freezer section of most grocery stores
I paid 5 bucks for 10 inches which looked like one NYC slice
The staff is friendly, but one guy is so HYPER he was annoying
If you are not that hungry and want an expensive snack, go here
There is a deli around the corner where you will be better off called Chicken Deli (bad name-decent food) at 28th and Park
Ok
As far as I can tell, this place is NOT up for Best Pizza of the Year by CitySearch
But is should be! The places that are nominated - I've been to - and I have NOT been impressed
THIS PLACE IMPRESSES ME! Their Pizza is unusual, interesting, stylish, exciting and most important: DELISH! What else can you ask for in a pizza? Now this place deserves to be voted BEST PIZZA in NYC! Not some of the lame places that are runing for office now
Write in your ballot for Pinch Pizza by the Inch
Such good pizza here
You can have it anyway you want it
Many toppings to choose from
Atmosphere is great, awesome music playing in the background, and very quick and friendly staff
The only negaitve I found is the price of the food here
quality of food is excellent
consistency has definitely improved
toppings innovative - garlic mushrooms, thai hot peppers, also has great salads
these two guys who run the place are clearly good guys also
in summation,this place rules
First, try the tomato-mozz-basil salad -- not a traditional caprese (as is the trend at Pinch), but it's really well-done
The mozz tomatoes are tossed in pesto and then topped with fresh, chopped basil
Second, the mushrooms they put on pizza are marinated in oil and well-salted -- just delicious
The only drawback to this spot is the NOISE
The teeny back room just booms when the tables are full
Sitting up front at the bar is a much better way to go if you're noise-sensitive
Best Pizza ever! The genius concept is perfect for people of all appetites
Trust me you'll be ordering more after the first bite
Delicious, convenient (they deliver!), and simply the best new restaurant on Park Avenue
I was walking down Park Avenue and passed this place named Pinch
Looked new so I went in and I must say this restaurant blew my mind
What an amazing concept! After doing research I found out everyone is calling Todd Birnbaum, the Owner of this fine establishment, the Brainchild of the idea of pizza by the inch
His Brother also is there in the kitchen cooking up wonderful delights
Highly recommend to all including those with children
For anyone who loves Eddies Pizza in Long Island, Pinch has the best pizza in Manhattan
Their service is fantastic with a courteous and attentive staff
They also double bake their crust for extra flavor
Also
now that its summer the windows are open, making it a great lunch or dinner spot
Will be back soon!
This is my new favorite pizza place in New York and I've been to quite a few
The pizza has a great original taste highligted by the perfectly done crust and original toppings
You can tell that nothing comes from a can in this place, the made fresh from scratch taste really comes through!
Been waiting for a thin crust pizza place that could consistantly deliver
Found it

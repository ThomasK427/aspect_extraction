My friend asked if there was something they could do, i
e
, offer an apeteizer or compensation
The waitress said no and unlike any other restaurant in Manhattan did not offer to bring her manager over
A year later I gave Salud a second chance, maybe the management had changed or maybe that was just a bad day
I was WRONG and had a worse experience
I am boggled by the outstanding reviews it has received on citysearch
Great Tapa plates, but even for tapas they are way too small amount, and way too noisy to have any kind of conversations at all
Salud is a great restaurant that I recommend to everyone who asks me
The ambience is great
On our first visit, the wall street crowd during happy hour was a little too loud, but the food overall has been consistently great the couple of times I have been there
I have tried at least half of the appetizer/tapas menu and every single one has been well presented and had me wanting more
Salud is a coxy nook that takes you away from the madness of the workday
We usually get there for a late lunch, but early or late, the staff is always eager to greet you and food is always excellent
Salud may be a small plates favorite, but there is nothing small about there attention to detail, even down to the spotless glasses the drinks are served in!
Food is excellent, highly recommended
I eat at Salud at least once every 2-3 weeks
Dependant on your mood and day of the week you can sit at this location to enjoy a fun filled evening with great food and great people
But when your with someone special you want the place all to yourself, go on a weekday, as I do, and you'll see what I mean
A cozy little table set off to the corner
A bottle of wine and the paella will remind you of the old country
The aroma fills the small space, ask them to light the candle and enjoy a private dinner for 2
A little live music adds to the charm of my new favorite place in the Financial District
Best Wishes and Good Luck Eddie
service was exellent
food couldnt get any better
decor was verry inviting
i will definately e there many more times!
This place is a true gem-I felt as though I had been whisked into the movie Casablanca
The mojitos are the best I ever tasted!
My first time at salud restaurant was for our christmas party and i have been there atleast seven times after that
The food is great the staff is friendly
i enjoyed a romantic dinner with my boyfriend,enjoyed a night out with friends and have also celebrated my parents 30th anniversary at salud
The drinks are especially great
What a pleasant surprise! A wonderful place to sit, enjoy delicious food, dance, and enjoy good company
The food was awesome, the service top notch, and the ambience lovely
A new favorite place for me
Salud is one place that makes you feel at home
Their great service and relaxing ambience makes me want to come back everytime
I try to make it out there atleast once a month
The people are great, and if you like salsa, this is the place to enjoy your meal with a classic tropical sound
I give it two thumbs up!  Suzely 060305
Great ambience, phenomenal drinks, and the bartender was absolutely amazing
I have never tasted anything better than Salud's Langostacos and Paellita
Even my sister said that their Paellita is tastier than the ones she had in Spain
Plus, their coco mojito rocks!
On a rainy V-Day in 2005, Salud created a sunny and romantic atmosphere for my girlfriend and me
Thoughts of that dreary night disappeared in the face of the staffs pleasant manner and attention to detail
The beautiful ambiance was augmented by relaxing and invigorating music
After dinning there on prior occasions, I have come to appreciate the excellent food and service
I recommend Salud to anyone who values the exceptional things in life!
that day i was walking by this restaurant suddendly i decide to walk in , place seem busy and good i told my self let me give it a try, i tried but food was too oily and pricey, listen people think twice before u walk in
!
I have dined 3 times at Salud and all the meals have been wonderful
The staff is very friendly and the food has consistently been great
I have to agree with the previous reviews, the mojitos are amazing
They put a strip of sugar cane in them which I thought was a nice touch
Although the South Street Seaport is very quite during the weeknights and on weekend, you can't miss out on experiencing this great spot
My wife and I happened to be the South Street Seaport area the other night and stumbled across Salud while looking for a place to eat dinner
Although slightly on the pricey side, we would definately return here again
The food was terrific
Everything we had was great
Our waiter was excellent
I have nothing bad to say
The place was pretty empty when we were there (there were 2 other tables occupied), but it was a weeknight, so maybe that had something to do with it
This place is cozy and serves DELICIOUS food! I loved everything I ate! Great variety to please anyone who goes
The presentation of the food is just as exquisite as the flavors
Great value for the quantity and quality of food
I loved this place
I have dined at Salud Restaurant Bar twice and both times I had an amazing experience
The food is delicious, the drinks are excellent (the mojitos are the best I've had in the city) and the staff was very welcoming
The dining room has a warm feel to it--almost as if you were on vacation
Great addition to the Seaport!
Where else can you eat 5 dumplings for $1
They are very tasty and of course cheap! The place is small so it might be hard to get a table to eat in, but whenever I am in Chinatown, I usually just go to take out
It's easy to miss this place, but find it because they have great sushi at reasonable prices
Especially if you like trying different kinds of sushi rolls, I recommend coming here
I had the Sleeping Beauty roll and it was delicious
Check it out
I have never eaten at UMI, but order from them on a weekly basis
They use fresh ingredients and offer really inventive rolls at great prices
The shrimp mango roll is a MUST!!!
Although not the best sushi in NYC a great reliable place that has a tremendous vareity of great rolls
The staff is real freindly and make it a pleasure to eat there
have tried alot of different sushi restaurants in the area, but Oyama has the most fresh Sushi Sashimi
also a lot of different Special Dishes everyday
loves the Spicy Tuna Bowl which is the tuna and cucumber in special chilly sauce
yummm
great food, great presentation, nice quiet rommatic enviroment and friendly stuffs
the best sushi restaurant in the area
hey if u looking for nice quiet roommantic candle dinner Oyam is ur #1 choice
The only thing you should not bother doing is listening to others that tell you not to bother with this place
I've eaten here a few times and the fish is very fresh and much better than a lot of the sushi places on the upper west
Those who think that the food at Oyama isn't up to par with other restaurants in the area probably ask for ketchup with their california rolls
The service may be a bit on the slow side, but the freshness of the food clearly makes up for it alongside the great prices
Take my work and give this place a shot
I should have known something was wrong when a Japanese restaurant didn't have a menu in Japanese
The food is decent to good
The space is really nice, and the prices were reasonable
Unfortunately, the service really needs to sharpen up or they're gonna get a bad reputation

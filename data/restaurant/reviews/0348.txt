I highly recommend this restaurant
Just be prepared to pay, as the menu is a bit pricey
Everything that Fiamma has served us has been simply excellent - the quality of the food is amazing, and the dishes are inventive
The ambience is nice -- cool lighting, well decorated
The service is perfect - the servers are very knowledgeable both about the food and their great wine list
Overall it's on the pricey side, but well worth it
My husband and I came here for a special occasion - our first wedding anniversary
This place really went over the top to make us feel unwelcome
First, I had called ahead to ask if we could bring a bit of cake since it was our anniversary and wanted to do the traditional thing
NO! the woman replied
So we showed up with our reservations and even though the place stayed pretty empty throughout the night, they seated us right next to the swinging kitchen doors
When my husband asked for some recommendations on wine, the sommelier got really smug and said something like well ALL of our wines are smooth
He might as well have added a duh at the end of his sentence, he said it in such a rude way
So the food was truly divine, no complaints there, but it just wasn't worth enduring the service
This was a cool spot to hit
We had a group of about 10 and ordered different entree's a few bottles of wine and some aps
The service was fantastic, the ambiance was great, the food was good
We had a fantastic evening
Went there last night with out of town clientel
Everyone loved the food
Everything from the pasta tasting to the dessert was exceptional
Good value as well
Would go back there again
Service was attentive and always there when you needed something
Did not feel rushed to leave as it was pretty crowded when we finished
I recommend the butternut squash pasta
Best pasta I have ever had!! Easy to make a reservation and parking outside the restauraunt is not bad if you get there right before 6PM
Street parking after 6PM on Spring St between 6th and Sullivan
I took my boyfriend to, what used be my favorite restaurant, Fiamma, for a special occasion
We were greatly disappointed
The wait staff, which usually are quite attentive and complement the experience, were awful and unhelpful!! The food was waaaaay overpriced and the portions seem to have shrunk! Even the ambienance has changed to casual, people were very dressed down
Typically, the atmosphere is romantic and elegant, where sneakers aren't appropriate, which I enjoy-- It used be a place to get dressed up, have a great meal, eat amazing desserts and be waited on
Not the case anymore
I will not be returning
What happened?!
this is the second time i've been here
haven't been in a couple of years but the food and service was excellent as it was the first time
I had the Capesante and I finally had to try the Gaganelli
which was out of this world
I was so good i can't wait to go back and have it again
my girlfriend had the risotto which was excellent and we both had a glass of wine
which is the only draw back
very overpriced
and the service was excellent
ask for Nicholas for your server
he will definite take care of you
My girlfriends and I are self-proclaimed foodies and keep coming back to Fiamma to try everything on their ever-changing and beautiful menu- a tough task
Everything is really to die for- you'll dream of the garganelli (the best pasta in NY) in bed at night well after going
But the best part for me and my friends is hanging out at the bar with a sampling of desserts, some espresso, maybe a chocolate martini, and Peter, their sexy and funny bartender (he's usually on the upstairs floor, we've found
) Enjoy!
And wonderful service
Our group ate there for the first time and it was a pleasure from start to finish
Ronald, our waiter, was friendly and helpful (one of our group had a particular food allergy and the chef modified an appetizer for that person's need)
We had the scallops, veal, duck and cod, all delicious
Best part was the desserts, and the extra services they gave us, and we were treated with the utmost respect and attention
Truly, a delightful evening
The pastas were some of the very best I had in my life
The service was perfect, Alexis is great! The wine list is very intimidating but the sommelier recommended a beatiful bottle for $60, we loved it so much we had two, both he decanted for us tableside
It was our first time to Fiamma and we will definitely be back
I love Fiamma
I have been there many times since the opening, for drinks, apps and long wonderful dining experiences
Sitting at the bar on the second fl to me is the place to be, you have the bartender (most recently a very attractive guy named Peter)all to yourself to explain the menu and serve you undividedly
I highly reccomend you try it
Buona Sera
I brought my parents to Fiamma Osteria for their 45th Anniversary two nights ago
The service and attention to detail were stupendous; the food and presentation--dazzling
A well-known New York personality was sitting at the next table but we felt that we were treated as if WE were the special ones
At the end of the meal we were given not one or two extra treats but three, including some chocolates to take away
Excellent scallop appetizer and wonderful veal ravioli that night
Very highly recommended
From the reservationist, to the hostess', to the waitstaff, to the sommelier and the General Manager, you have a journey of FANTASTIC proportions
The Food is Awe-inspiring, the service is Perfection, the decor and ambiance are perfect New York
It doesn't get better than this
even in Italy
Thanks to the whole staff
I have been to Fiamma 4 times in the past 2-3 years
Last night, the service was, as always
very attentive and the food was good (the rabbit ravoli and cod were great; the octopus antipasta was tasteless)
Gone was the hip Soho crowd that I remember
Everything seemed tired, scratched, and, no longer new, including the patrons
The restaurant has lost its buzz
Also, the wine list is out of control
While many great wines are listed, few are in the affordable $50-80 range; expect $90 and up and nothing but balsamic vinegar for under $50
Lastly, dessert was a failure
The donuts are still the best
The dessert special, some sort of plummed up cheesecake parfait, was inedible
It looked like a slightly thawed Sara Lee dessert and it tasted like something that was in the freezer a couple months too long
Dessert should be yummy, not gummy
Clearly a cut above the rest of italians
Had the Garganelli (pasta in a cream sauce with prosciutto)
It was outstanding
So much I didn't want the eating experience to end
House cabernet was also excellent
They also gave a large portion (seemed like more than one glass - they poured some and left the rest in a separate lil' carafe to pour the rest)
That glass though was $18
Coffee was tremendous too, including their presentation of it (gave a lil' teapot, so I could have a lil' bit at a time instead of pouring a large cup and having it get cold quickly)
Total bill for that was $55
A must go - would rate this a 9
6
What a great place

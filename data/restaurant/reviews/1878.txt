The corn, mole, polenta, everything -- makes this the best deal in SoHo, if not everything below 14th
We LOVE the takeout side -- it's the same food, except it's hot, ready in 5 minutes and you don't have to fight your way through groups of 5 (it's a small restaurant! take your huge party to the Heartland Brewery or something!) to get to your seats
Viva Habana!
heard about how great the food was so decided to try it
went with a group which admittedly is not the best idea cuz the place is so tiny but when the waitress tells you 15 minutes you think
15 minutes right? wrong
we were waiting there for half an hour
while the space the waitress was holding for us was allowed to be invaded by groups of 2s or 3s
so decide to just go down the block to another restaurant
at this point the waitress actually calls us back and yells at us for leaving when we had told her we were going to eat there
wtf?!?! definitely rude and wrong to treat people who didnt even get to be first time customers
i am never going back there again
no food is worth the BAD ATTITUDE
Great food - go just for the corn
If you hate waiting for a table, then get take-out just around the corner next door
Service is not great, but that's because it's so busy and cramped in there
Waiting for a table can take as long as one hour
Go early for dinner or else really late
Even though there's usually a wait for a table, the food and coffee (yes, the infamous corn and the large cafe con leche) here is well worth the wait
The food is well-prepared and extremely flavorful and the prices are very reasonable
I found this restaurant when I first moved to the village
It is a wonderful place to eat, with a enjoyable waitstaff and authenitc Italian food
All of the waiters on staff and the chef are related
They have a connection that made the evening very enjoyable
I left very satisfied! Also they staff will almost make you anything you can think of
even if it isn't on the menu
You can't beat the price especially for great homemade pasta!
A great italian restaurant right in the heart of the village
As soon as you walk thru the door your greated and treated like family
The food is wonderfully prepared and just delicious
The manager Franco, came to our table several times, to make sure every thing was to our liking
One of the best italian restaurants around
Service and food can't be beat
Will definately make this one of our regular stops
We were graciously greeted and immediately seated in the beautiful Garden Room
It felt like we were dining outside
Our waiter suggested the wine and homemade pasta with shrimp
For dinner my husband ordered the special, Wild Boar with Potato Gnocchi, it was wonderful
The broccoli rhab was so good I couldnt stop eating it even though I was full from my main course
Masconis is a very comfortable and delicious place to eat with friends
We cant wait to go back again
We've been going to this place for about 2 years - I accidentally discovered it passing by on Houston
Great paella and higadillos (chicken livers)
Yum sangria and very-very comfortable and relaxing atmosphere
Veal is great as well
If you're going on the weekend night or a holiday it makes sense to make a reservation - the space is tight
The owner Pedro and the waiters are some characters - they look like brothers ;) Overall a great dining experience for a very moderate price
A must go
This place is phenomenal! We enjoyed the food and the sangria rocks! Try the blonde sangria
most restaurants don't even have it! The staff is very friendly and very accomodating
I asked for a virgin pia colada (which was delicious) and got it without a problem
I will definitely be a regular customer at this restaurant!
hi ive been a regular customer of el paso for 20 years or so , i really enjoy the best spanish/mexican food in ny great prices, great service by the waiters and owner Pedro of the resturant, nice quaint atmosphere , friendly people just a down home best food from spain/and mexico
way to go
We went here on a whim and were so pleased with this little, unassuming restaurant
Great paella (if that's how you spell it)
Pleasant staff
Fast Service
Great Food
A brilliant little spot--intimate and authentic with LOVELY staff and FABULOUS food
The Vegetarian Delight (a cheese enchilada and a bean burrito) is great
I've been three times now and will definitely go back
First of all, anything with cheese in it is spectacular here
I don't know what they do to it but it is sooooo good
Try the enchiladas or the quesadilla
The seafood is a great value and is delicious
like the lobster special for $14, the paella, or the shrimp in garlic sauce
Do yourself a favor and get to know the friendly owner and staff
Pretty soon you will be a regular and you never saw it coming
A delightful retreat after a long day's work
The perfect corner, tucked into the cusp of Soho, to meet a friend and unwind with friendly service and spicy, surprising cuisine
Highly recommend the seafood medly and any of the various veal dishes
Whether your in the mood for a traditional Mexican meal or flavorful Spanish cuisine, this is the place to eat your fill
Take it from a regular
For the price ($14 fajitas) you get a great 1
5hrs of entertainment
starting with the food the fajitas were nicely spiced and juicy and it came with incredibly thin tortillas (unlike the often thick bready kind you get elsewhere) plus it included a salad
on top of the food great service (water guy was always present), you have the mariachia man to entertain
He played Sinatra's My Way in Spanish while we were there, it was great ask him to play it if you go
Great place, one odd thing the woman at the door didn't speak English??? which struck me as odd
From the other reviews I was expecting much better
The chips were stale (they finally brought out fresh ones after the second basket was sent back
) The bartender was unfriendly and unaccomodating
I asked for a virgin margarita because I'm pregnant and he said he couldn't make it
The traditional mexican dishes were good but don't order anything that's a stretch
My friend ordered the tuna steak medium rare and it came back well done
If you like Mariachi music at your table frequently, you'll enjoy this experience
This restaurant is the best
My husband had the fish which he said was terriffic, I had a combo plate and black bean soup which was absolutely wonderful
The owner is very friendly, the service was perfect and friendly as well
The atmosphere is great
I just wish this restaurant was where we lived
Prices are very resonable
If you want a perfect place to eat this is it
El Paso is a wonderful and pleasant restaurant! The service is fast and friendly
The food is delicious
the Stuffed Lobster is a seafood lover's dream come true! The owner, Pedro, is always on hand to make his patrons feel at home
The Sangrias and Pina Coladas are to die for! The Spanish and Mexican decor and music make a wonderful addition to this exceptional restaurant!
Pleasant, wonderful and charming
This is a very nice restaurant

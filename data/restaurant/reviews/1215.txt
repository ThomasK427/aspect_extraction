It took forever for our order to be taken and our food to be served (it was not busy, midweek at 1:45pm)
My appetizer was burned on top and my friend's fish was over salted
To top it off, they recently changed their policy and now only take AMEX
The 4+ previous times we have gone there, we paid using Visa
I asked the server about the change and he gave me attitude, as if this had been the policy all along
The experience was so disappointing that I had to change my previously glowing review
I have eaten at Jolie three times and every time it has been just spectacular! The steak tartare is a perfect starter
The lamb is falling-off-the-bone delicious and served with the most wonderful potatoes
And the tilapia
utterly amazing
The staff: on pointe and not at all snotty
Cocktails: A great drink list---try the Magda
Wine: such great selections
One of the few places in the neighborhood that offers wines from the Pacific Northwest (try a red from Dunham Cellars)
I could go on and on
Loved Jolie on a recent late summer night
The Garden is beautiful, service impeccable and all of our food was delicious from appetizer to dessert
Very romantic and well-appointed
I can't wait to go back!
I'm a Brooklyn Girl all the way, and it's nice to visit such a classy, tasteful scene Downtown
The food was excellent (especially the hanger steak with sauteed onions---and the Apple Tart - sinfully delicious) and the service was incredibly friendly and accomodating
The ambiance had me sold from the minute I walked into the backyard for dining alfresco on a beautiful summer evening
Even the ladies room is cute - candlelit and clean! I'm definitely adding this to my fav list of spots to visit
I've had the pleasure of eating at Jolie a couple of times now and each time I've had a great experience
The ambience is sophisticated, yet soothing creating a great environment to take a date
The food is very tasty, especially the skate and the hangar steak and the wine list is well thought out and provides really good value
The service has always been terrific and professional
If the weather ever warms up, I can't wait to dine in their outdoor garden!
From the moment I walked in I felt as if everything about this restaurant was pretty; from the bartenders and waitstaff to the red velvet banquette, old school french posters on the wall, and gold marble bar
As I sat to eat with a large group of friends I had high hopes for evening and Jolie delivered! The presentation of all the dishes were c'est magnifique
The Herring appetizer was amazing and the crab cake with its sauce were my favorite
By the end of the meal I was absolutely in love with the Hanger Steak (which i have been back for several times)
The portions are a lot larger than I expected making me feel like it was worth every penny
And the wine list was unbelievably inexpensive for the quality
I recommend the Spanish Rioja
This spot is hot!
We stumbled upon this great little restaurant the other week and decided to give it a try, and WOW, what a real find!  From the moment we walked we instantly fell in love with this place
The staff is authentic, the food was great and the ambience was real
I highly recommend this restaurant where you will find it affordable and extremely satisfying
Jolie, see you very soon
Great wholesome people
The perfect place to bring your family
Lots of morals and great food! You'll feel right at home!
This is one unique French bistro with great food, beautiful decor and excellent service! Thank you Jolie and welcome to Brooklyn!
This pleace is great! Ben, the handomse French owner is sweet and attentive
If his African American wife is there you're in for an especially grand treat!
This is one awesome place!!! Great food, decor and nice people!
Simply put - the place is classy, the owners ae hot and the food is DIVINE! Great cocktails are named after regulars and female friends, the new patio awning in the two-tiered garden is heavenly (keeps the sun and rain off!), the wine is some of the best as far as price and selection in the city and they have a great event space - a friend had her engagement party with them
Brooklyn deserves to have a jolie good time! And they have the best steak tartar I have EVER had!
Jolie is a charming little restaurant in the up and coming neighborhood of Boerum Hill and is conveniently located close to the Brooklyn Bridge and Atlantic subway station
Anyway, the food is superb: fresh, the chef isn't heavy-handed with sauces, and the desserts are superb
They also have the best drinks and the cutest waitstaff
The manager always goes out of his way to accomodate patrons and make sure we're satisfied
Definitely a must whenever you're in the BAM-Cobble Hill area!
Great new bistro that compares favorably with the best bistros in Manhattan
The steak and steak tartare are particularly outstanding as is the Tarte Tatin
Great brunch too
The nicest place in Fort Green by far- the decor is fabulous
The ambience is great, great menu, nice staff
Definitely worth traveling from Manhattan to visit
Reccommend!
My second visit to June's and it is still on my #1 list
Even though it was a quiet night due to the frigid temperature, the service was good, the food was good and the prices are excellent
The crown of the evening was when the owner Charles walked in, the first thing he did was enter the bathroom and wash his hands before serving behind the bar
LOVE IT
This is the kind of place to dine at
Great Standards Congrats!!!!
This is honestly one of the best restaurants I've randomly found in Brooklyn
Was in the area and decided to stop in for a great surprise
The ambience was great, a very diverse group of patrons
The music was old RB that the current crop of unoriginal artists sample to make platinum
It was the most tender and least fatty hanger steak I've ever had, the herb mashed potatos were tasty, and the chicken over the bed of red beans and corn was so flavorful
To top it off, they had a fairly decent wine selection considering this was just a random door that we walked into for dinner
They even have a back room with more of a lounge atmosphere for groups
Now, the only reason that I ever stopped into June was because I thought I could get a free drink
I was wrong, but let me tell you, I enjoyed it anyway
Have you ever been to the Aveda store? June has the same calming effect
The bartender is talented--the plain old drinks are great, the drinks from the drink menu are great, and the drinks that the bartender intuits from one's mood are GREAT
The plates are small, but everything that I have tried are June has been very good
The salmon is a nice choice
Went recently for what we thought would be a nice evening meal al-fresco
We were left to our own devises outside for about fifteen minutes before any reappeared to take our order
( The place was empty inside and there was alot of staff on - so no excuses)
Waitress was very unknowledgeable about menu
We order a really good white wine, and only when she was opening the bottle in front of us- did i notice she had brought us the cheaper one
She left again to check her error - returned about 5 minutes later to tell us its all they had left
this made me very angry- it should have been pointed out to us first

Service was terrible
No water - even though we kept on asking
Not too pleasant on a sticky June night
Just go! Everything about this place is worth the trip
Sometimes it feels like washington heights is a world a way, but really its just a short hop on the A train (it took me 15 minutes from 14th street) and the train stops practically right in fromt of In Vino Veritas
The food is good, the music is great, the wine list is outstanding, and the vibe is contageous
I lived two blocks from this place for over a year before going in--what a mistake to have waited so long! This place is great--a fantastic and relaxing little nook in East-of-Broadway WaHei
The owners Fred and Liz are so sweet and helpful, the wines are fantastic, the beers are even better (go against your better judgment and try the banana-flavored one from Belgium), and they even have a sake menu now! Food is great, too--especially the prosciutto
:-) Definitely check it out
In Vino Veritas provides a cozy setting where excellent wine and food can be enjoyed at a reasonable price
The service is outstanding- attentive, but not rushing
The wine list is especially impressive, but there is not a hint of pretentiousness when recommending or discussing the wines

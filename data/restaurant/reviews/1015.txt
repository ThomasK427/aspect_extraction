The cheeecake balls for dessert were awful
Avoid this restaurant on a busy night at all costs -- they have yet to learn how to make the appropriate number of reservations; the front of the house and the managers are amateurs
We waited 45 minutes after our 9:30 reservation (which is a bit our mistake for not leaving sooner as that ineptitude is rare among the finer restaurants in the city) and were then brought to a miserable table next to the bar and a server station, at which point we finally called it quits
And we were not alone
One couple had a reservation at 9pm and were sat just minutes before they attempted to sit us
The bar was a disaster because there were no tables for anyone, and drinks took 20 minutes to receive
Trust me -- stay far away (at least for a year and then if they are still open)!
The food is absolutely beautiful and fantastic, and the setting, a gorgeous townhouse, is opulent
Donatella is warm and gracious- and she treats all the patrons well
It isn't cheap, but hey, this is New York!
Though it's been almost 2 weeks since my visit, I couldn't let the memory rest without sharing to fellow restaurant goers my abominable evening at Davidburke Donatella
Admittedly, the food was stellar, including the desserts they selected for us free of charge, just so we would hurry along in time for the next guests
But the insults don't end there
Expect your experience to nosedive from the has-been [wannabe] diva host, Donatella herself, to the patronizing servers with condescending accents, to the thugs from the kitchen who actually came out to the sidewalk hoping to whip up a last minute knuckle sandwich for a dissatisfied client
If paying for attitude makes you feel important, please go and God bless you
If you expect common courtesy that you would offer even to a pigeon, then I urge you to take your business elsewhere
At $160 pp, anyone can do better
Overly loud (even for a trendy restaurant); overly cramped (even for New York); and the most condescending waitstaff in any city in the world
The attitude was so egregious--especially for the high prices--that we asked to speak to a manger to complain about our waiter(s)
The food was OK--not what it was hyped to be
A salad we'd asked for no goat cheese on, for example, came out smelling and tasting of goat cheese (obviously pre-prepared, and they just scraped it off--at these prices, we expected more!)
I had a burger for lunch and it was fatty and grizzled
Bottom line: This is overhyped and overpriced--don't go
It's all about expectation management! My expectations were high and I got disappointed
When my friend and I walked in, the entrance/coatcheck/reception/bar area was claustrophobic and I wanted to leave
The dining area was also relatively small (I don't like my neighbours - regardless who they are - listening to my conversation)
Other than that, the place was pretty good
Excellent service! Clientele is well-heeled (thus the strong lighting - to see those Ferragamos and Choos)
The food was a bit disappointing
I did not like my red snapper, so I ate half of my friend's steak which was unbelievably good! The snapper was chewy and saffron rice overpowering
Desserts are excellent however! This is a great place if you want to impress a client, or smoke in the SUV limo parked outside
But not so great for a romantic dinner or dinner with friends
The Scene This restaurant does multiple duty as a cafe, dessert bar, brunch place and fine-dining spot
Coral and rust colors give an air of luxury to the smallish, extensively windowed room
It's unmistakably upscale, with past and present branches in the Hamptons and the Upper East Side
The Food Sant Ambroeus' kitchen pays close attention to ingredients and methods, resulting in delicate, often exquisite Italian meals
A caprese salad's mozzarella is silky, not mushy, and its olive oil resounds with pepper and fruit
Pappardelle layered with smoky speck and translucent sheets of hard cheese fills the mouth with perfect balanced flavor; in a prosecco-tinged risotto, rice grains are discrete but melting
Full-flavored gelati in a host of flavors and combinations, boozy tiramisu and airy hazelnut mousse are among the excellent dessert choices
they should double the prices to keep out what little riff raff gets inside this place
almost no children, cell phone users, tourists, bridge and tunnel types, or large groups
the food is the closest to real Italian food that you can find
serene, casual, dignified, i go almost every day
We were seated promptly on a Saturday night
We found the service excellent and the food that we ordered to be fresh and succulent
The restuarant's decor is nice and a great ambience
The place is good for couples and a great place to have a conversation
Although, we found the place a bit pricey, overall we highly recommended it for small groups
Everything I have EVER had here is absolutely delicious! The food is extremely FRESH - an absolute pleasure
One of my favorite restaurants in NY! If you want great food with friendly service in a nice setting - Sant Ambroeus is the place
My boyfriend lives down the stree and we have mde many stops for take-out, eat-in, brunch, almost every possible scenario and we find it absolutely wonderful in every respect
The service is top-notch, the food terrific and the place is beautiful
a welcome addition to the neighborhood!
The Scene This brick-trimmed trattoria sits blocks away from the hip heart of Williamsburg (as well as the subway), but that hasn't dissuaded diners
The small bar, tucked among wood tables and chairs, attracts a steady stream of wine drinkers, and by 8pm, the comfortable candlelit space is packed
The vibe is casual, thanks to throbbing pop music and relaxed service
The Food Carb abstainers, beware: Chef and co-owner Riccardo Buitoni hails from Italy's Piemonte region, and his inexpensive menu showcases impossible-to-resist homemade pastas
His bread basket alone, laden with crispy rosemary focaccia, portends instant relapse
Start with buttery buffalo-milk mozzarella with tomato-herb confit, or generous plates of cured meats
Then yield to cilandretti (spinach-ricotta crepes sliced into gnocchi-sized bites with heady fontina-truffle fondue) or delicate tomato-tossed tagliatelle baked in foil with fresh shellfish
Entrees include Barolo-braised beef, and moist monkfish served with prosciutto crisps
Accompaniments, like creamy polenta and garlicky greens, are superb
Took my husband here for his birthday
Our reservation was for 8:30, we arrived at 8:36 and the host told us that he was just about to give the table away
Whatever
The good news was he was the only jerk in the restaurant
Everyone else, including our waitress was great
The food is amazing
Can't wait for another celebration
Now you go to an italian restaurant about 6 to 8 times a month and finally your mouth tells you someone in the kitchen gets it right
I had the stuffed quail just simply the right notes,the artichokes same thing tender right savoryness someone in the kitchen knows his produce
The service was pretty good and suggested an inexpensive fun sicilian wine that worked great with my gnocchi with beef,my guest had the fish cacciuco/boullibase very very happy
The ambiance and the music was fun and relaxing, i love their garden and can't wait for it to be open
We decideed to have dessert and i had the gianduia budino and my guest went for the waiter suggestion of the umbrian dessert both very decadent and well done
You could just savor the many hours spent over evry single dish
This is a great bargain williamsburg people get up and take advantage of it
I and my husband, a native of Italy were guests at a friends birthday party last week
The service was smooth, attentive, and the food was teriffic
It was the first time in a long time where we enjoyed everything from beginning to the end
from the moment we were greeted at the door by the warm Maitre'D to our patient and knowledgeable server
We returned last night , just the two of us for a romantic dinner
Aurora TOTALLY came thru again
The tortelli filled with squab was to die for and we had the special hangar steak ( for 18$) the price is right, the atmosphere is cozy, charming and rustic and the wine list is filled with all Italian wines at excellent price points
This is sure to become one of our favorite spots
Worth the trip from the city
Aurora is one of the few true and real Italian restaurant in New York, you can eat there as good as you were in Italy
Great food, very interesting wine list and very plesent service
Is a perfect place to relax with friends or with the beloved
Higly reccomended
I went to Aurora for the first time with friends, Williamsburgh area take me back in the past, the restaurant ambience is very rustic, they put olive oil and bread on the table the bread is very good remind me the bread I used to eat in Italy, the food was very good and tasty, but the portions are ridiculos small I mean for what you pay at least you deserve a modest portion, I ordered filet sol and gamberoni with a delicious red sauce the size of the fish was microscopic, i just made the the plate clean eating bread, my wife ordered ravioli, we could barely see them in the plate, our friends complain also with their portion so miserable small, I really dont know if I ever go back there unless I'm on diet, maybe I will if they will make adjustment on their portion
Really delicious
Had pasta with clams, small clams
And tiny tiny portions! Delicious bread, and they didn't want to bring more when requested, saying they didn't have any! Cute atmosphere
Price? More on the expensive side
So in summation, delicious food, kinda pricey, and you don't get a lot for your buck
If you like nouveau -- which means tiny portions -- you won't squawk
Absolutely phenominal talent in the kitchen
Aurora has never let me down
While not exactly cheap, you get more than what you pay for with perfect portions and impeccable preparation
Not much more I can say about it, the food is fantastic - what else can you say?

Meals were average at best
Dinner bill minus any drinks was around 70 bucks
Recent renovaitons eliminated one of the big draws, the Brick Oven which turned out great pizza and the like has been REMOVED
I went there at least a dozen times per year hosting and or directing parties to pescatore as well
It looks like the place is in going to head down the slippery slope of cutting cost and losing more business
It's a shame and I'm not happy
A little pricey, but otherwise the olives were delicious and the lobster bisque wonderful
My mother loved her penne ala vodka
Overall, a wonderful experience
When I have guests in town, I can always count on there being great food and service at an affordable price here
Decor exudes a traditional warm and cozy vibe
Every dish I've tried there is fantastic
This quaint restaurant has a great staff and the best ravioli I have ever eaten!! And I know ravioli
My friends all enjoyed their meals, as well, and we had a wonderful time
We will definitely go back
This is a great place for lunch during the week
The value at lunch time is great and you have a wide range of things to choose from
My department always has lunch out here when we go out as a group
Very good food
You can chose between Pasta, Chicken, Sandwiches and of course fish
I don't eat fish, but I have heard they have great seafood
They have a monsterous fish dish which takes two people to eat
It is hard to find a restaurant that you can count on for a romantic dinner or a fun lively time with some friends or a great party setting with such reliable service and continually fabulous food
Maybe that is why there are so many regulars at Pescatore
The food is consistently delicious, always go for the fish special! or the osso buco and don't forget the chopped salad
The wine list is good, there is always a nice Chianti available and the staff is friendly and competent
I'm there every couple of weeks and from all the friendly faces I now recognize, so are a lot of other New Yorkers
Thanks Pescatore
What a night
MSKCC nurses went out for an extraordinary dinner!! We had a beautiful private room with a nice big wide table
Great for talking to the whole group
The food was amazing, the service was superior and the atmosphere was beautiful with very unique and fabulous paintings on the walls! We will be back
Pescatore is an overall wonderful restaurant! Great place to dine with a few friends or to have company parties
Pescatore has been more than generous in arranging and hosting many parties for Memorial Sloan Kettering
The staff is extremely attentive, helpful and kind! The atmosphere is inviting, cozy and romantic
Most importantly, the food is delicious!!!
When a friend recently told me about this great restaurant on second ave, I was a bit skeptical bc her enthusiasm was over the top
She was not wrong to be excited about finding it
Pescatore has such a great warm atmosphere and delicious food
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BABY LAMB CHOPS! I could almost make a meal from the olives and bread that they serve before your meal arrives (but make sure you save room for dessert - delicious cheesecake)
The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating
Besides the great food, my boyfriend loved the big flat screen TV they have over the bar area
I am writing to rave about the fabulous night!! We had a going away party in a beautiful private room at Pescatore
What a great table we had, what a delicious dinner, superior service
I cannot thank you enough for treating our group so well
The table worked out great for our big group
It was perfect to talk to everyone! I could not think of a better dinner! We will definitely be back!!
Food and Service of the same high quality elsewhere in NY would have been twice the cost
Highly recommended!!!
We had a wonderful dinner here before the theatre
It was walking distance from our hotel (2 blocks)
The ambience was warm and friendly
The food was incredible!! We would recommend Linguini Pescatore very highly
All the seafood in it was prepared perfectly -- Not overcooked! Be prepared for LARGE portions
Loved the olives!
To sum it up, had a wedding shower there
Excellent service, good food, a pleasant experience
Planned a surprise bday party for my girlfriend, the management helped to make sure it went flawlessly
Amazing service, and how many follow up phone calls did i get? just for dining there? I love it!
With so many choices available to us in the city, may I suggest you venture elsewhere to satisfy your craving for fine Italian cuisine? I was there recently with a group of friends which gave me the opportunity to sample the menu
There was nothing that offended the senses, but there was also nothing notable to speak of
Instead the place manages to offer average fare, served by an inexperienced wait staff
I went to Pescatore on a Thursday
Excellent ambience, service was good but so dissapointed w/ the food
We ordered fried calamari for appetizer and it was gummy, linguini with clam sauce was dry
My friend ordered ravioli it was nothing special
You only pay for the ambience though
Had a very enjoyable dinner here
The food was great and the service was attentive (but not overbearing)
Very relaxed, but classy
Highly recommended
I have been dining at Pescatore for the past 3 years and absolutely love it, the service is always fantastic and the food delicious
Even on Valentine's day last year the service was impeccable, how many restaurants can you say that about in NYC!
The food melts in your mouth, the service is great and you'll definitely want to go back here and enjoy another great tasting dinner
Sushi Rose, Murphy's Pub, Oriental Noodle Pescatore are my 4 frequented spots in this area - diverse yet all very good
appetizers were good, mixed greens calamari veal francese were my favorite orders
bread little hard but dipped in olive oil balsamic was good
svc could be better
a little tight for table of 3-4
nice to sit by balcony except during hot humid weather
SUM IT: give this a try, a little pricey for this area but it's good food
What it seems to be a nice restaurant from the outside could turn into a very mediocre experience while sitting down
Our apetizers took quite a while to be served, in fact, while all the other tables that sat way after us were being served I asked the waiter what happened to our appetizers, the calamari was tough; The entrees were tasteless and really!, one have to be really bad to mess a simple pasta dish
Pitty!
I looked this place here, on citysearch, and decided to try it
Went there with my friends, one of them was an editor for Departure magazine (luxury travel, food and wine)
He used to dining at the best restaurants and he was surprised how great this place was
Food, service and atmosphere were way above your regular restaurant
Try it and see for yourself
Our meal was very nice and the service - eh, nothing to rave about
The waitress took us as tourists and hand wrote a message about tipping 20%
After paying she returned and demanded a higher tip
Thank you for the fantastic meal
My girlfriend and I went for a romantic dinner and came away satisfied
Strongly recommend the seafood pocket complimented with a nice bottle of California white wine
Pescatore is one of THE great restaurants in Manhattan
The service is great, the food is reasonably priced and it is delicious! In good weather the outdoor dining is the place to be
This resturant was good with a big group
I was searching diligently for an Italian resturant that was good with groups and had good food
They greeted me with a big Happy Birthday when we came in the door

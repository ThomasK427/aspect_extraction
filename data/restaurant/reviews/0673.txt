After being there for about 30 minutes, we got our drinks and MENUS! We eventually had to go to the front to ask the hostess to get a waiter to our table
I've never had such bad service
I know the restaurant is in the ever cool Williamsburg, but come on!
Friend of mine had a birthday dinner here
Couldnt believe how cool the place looked
Had a great time drink and gorging on the food
when the bill came- no one expected it to be so cheap
Excellent place, and food - very pleasantly surprised with dining experience - highly recommended!!!
All I have to say is we had a reservation at 8pm and we had not even sat down at 9:45pm
When we spoke with the manager he told us that starting the next day they would no longer take reservations and that was it
The staff was rude and very unhelpful
The woman at the front only smiled and nodded after we asked about our reservation
It was a terrible experience and I left without even sitting down
DO NOT GO!!!
I have nothing much to say other than, great place, great food, great drinks, great music and great staffs
haven't found such a unique place like this in NYC area
recommended!!! however, if you hate too crowded places - check them out during the weekdays
perfect!!
Beautiful space, good affordable food, nice music, and cute, friendly staff
Great addition to the neighborhood
Too crazy on the weekends, but great during the week for locals
I'm Thai
I went to SEA with lots of my Thai friends
We love the place,
so cool
The food was good too
Their Pad Thai is one of the best in NYC
I had a great time with my date by one of the pool tables
The waiters were super friendly! Drinks at the front bar by Rachel were awesome especially the strawberry guava one
Unfortunately they only take reservations for parties of 6 up so don't even bother trying if you have less
Everything on the menu is reasonably priced I'd recommend the porkchops, drunkman noodles crispy banana dessert
It does get busy so your best bet is to get in there before the dinner rush which I learned the hard way
Still I had a great time would go back in a heartbeat!
I've bacame a big fan of SEA Thai, Williamsburg
The design of the restaurant is soooo cool
huge space and great music, especially on the weekends
The food is outstanding!! also their desserts and special drinks
The service is great
The staffs are all nice and friendly
Eventhough they looked so busy but still smile and had time for us whenever we needed
Last but not lease, the price is CHEAP!
This place is GREAT! the food was really affordable and tasty too! the ambience was great
it's best to make reservations~ it gets packed at night
The Scene Concrete floors, dark steel accents, and dim lighting give this large room a hip, industrial flavor
The hard surfaces, reflecting the cries of the boisterous, young local dinner crowd, can make it quite noisy, but everyone's having too much fun to mind
A garden out back offers a very nice retreat during the warmer months
Service is highly competent
The Food The menu is pretty standard, offering the usual beef/pork/chicken/shrimp version of a handful of traditional Thai entrees
Pad khing, with a fresh ginger sauce, is excellent; likewise the panang curry
Pad see yue, a dish of ribbon-like rice noodles in a savory brown gravy, is very satisfying as well
Some dishes are not all they could be: mussels in a hot and sour broth are on the bland side, and green papaya salad lacks spice
An array of fried and grilled appetizers double as cocktail snacks
This place is great
It is inexpensive and the food and service are excellent
I have never had a bad meal here, and I am a regular
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery
Also very inexpensive
A great choice at any cost and a great deal
I don't know about you guys, but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the food not for the atmosphere
I'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud
Please
are you saying that the food is bad but I'll go back there because the atmosphere was good
No you're going to go back because the food was good
So all I'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I've ever been to
The best Chicken pad tai, I've ever had
And forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either
I've been to Joya twice and I will never go again
Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had reservations)
It is LOUD, HOT and DARK
You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation
It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it
I HATE HATE HATE this place
My favorite place to eat in Brooklyn
The food is fantastic and the prices are just as good
The only drawback: the place is LOUD!
Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere
Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you
And everytime I go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front
Get it together
If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan
This place does have great thai food at good prices
But their staff is incredibly obnoxious
Also, they swipe your plate away the minute you put your fork down, whether it's empty or not
I always feel hussled out, even if it's not jammed, which it almost always is
The wait is obscene, and the music is WAY too loud
It's impossible to talk to your dinner companions
Overall, it's not worth it
all the food is fresh and delicious, but the shrimp pad thai is truely exceptional
as a starter, go with the tofu tod
this place is comfortable, with a great, lively atmosphere
these people just GET it
they focus on the things that really matter (the food!) and pass the savings on to you
Great food, small atmosphere, great music, GREAT PRICE! I highly recommend it!
The prices may be reasonable at this very popular crowded place, but the food is SO salty I had to drink a quart of water afterwards
The dishes are not terribly interesting and the service is somewhat rude
Every apsect of this restaurant is wonderful
The food is light, but filling and oh so tasty
The staff is attentive, pleasant knowledgeable
This place gets packed yet the people are friendly (unlike Soju)

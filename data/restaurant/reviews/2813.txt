However, the service is atrocious and after last night's debacle I'll be sticking to take out
This is hands down the best Thai food I have had in NY and well worth the trip to Woodside
We ordered a variety of dishes for a group and everything was delicious and the perfect degree of spicy (i would recommend that those who like spice but have never experience 'Thai spicy' start with 'medium spicy')
The mango salad with squid, chicken and shrimp was refreshing and absolutely delicious
Great drunken noodles and curry dishes, delicious hot soups and absolutely attentive and friendly service
And, best of all, is very inexpensive
For summer days, there is a great outdoor garden area
Definitely take the trip to Woodside if you really want authentic and inexpensive Thai food
I would think so, anyway
And you can order enough to take home plenty, without breaking the bank! Their seafood is fresh-- have their fried soft-shell crab, or their whole fish with red chiles and basil
I'm fond of the green curry with duck, but all curries are quite good
You can also ask to modify the spice level of your food-- and if you ask for it to be really spicy, well, be prepared!  On warm nights, eat in the now fixed-up space in the back
No longer BYOB-- the place has had its liquor license for several months now
They offer an average-at-best selection of wine (with an expected focus on whites) and a few different beers
After eating in one after another crappy Thai restaurants through my life, I'd written off Thai food as a cuisine that could never rise above mediocre
Well, I was wrong
Sripraphai was, simply, excellent
Sripraphai does not shy away from aggressively spicing dishes, unlike the many pseudo Thai restaurants in the City
And their expansive menu offers the opportunity to take a broad tour of Thai cooking, with many dishes I've never seen in other restaurants
The decor there is nothing special, though somehow the service manages to deal with the large crowds in an efficient, friendly manner
Prices are reasonable, though they don't take credit cards
Be prepared to wait 30 minutes or longer on weekends for a table
Will definitely make the return trip to Queens soon
Among the 5 waitresses running around, no one took our dinner order for a while until we flagged one down
The jungle curry we were served smelled unusually funky, and we suspected that there was something wrong with it
However, after explaining this to our server, she simply said, We have a no refund policy
It's not our fault, right? Incidentally, the dinner did not sit well in my stomach afterwards
Their philosophy must be the customer is never right
Our Thai friend from Jersey does anything he can to go as often as possible, so we decided to give it a try
This turned out to be our most exquisite Thai dining experience ever
Surprisingly, he even ran into Thai friends from Jersey, who made the trip to Queens! Four of us, at a small table, ordered a ton of food, including amazing Lychee wine, and wondered how it would all fit on the table
Had great plans for the leftovers
What a surprise when the dishes came out, a few at a time, giving us an opportunity to explode with joy and savor each bite
When we were done, with perfect precision, our other dishes appeared
Everything was so ridiculosly delicious, that we scraped each generously-laden plate clean (no leftovers!)
Amazing food and gracious service at an incredible price
Can't wait to go back again!
I've tried so many Thai places within the five boroughs and nothing matches to this place
Time after time I crave for the papaya salad, green curry and thai ice tea
It is superb
It may get crowded at times and there may be a wait
But it is all worth it
I came here last night after reading good reviews of this place and it did not disappoint
With the lack of authentic Thai restaurants, it was a nice surprise
We ordered a good amount of dishes (2 apps, 1 entree and 1 main dish) and it was so reasonable for the amount of food we had
The outside is deceiving! It's a small store front but once you get inside, the restaurant is very accomodating esp since they renovated and expanded in the back
Waitstaff for the most part was pleasant with the exception of one waitress who was very rude
Try the satay sticks
it was a big order and very tasty
To begin, this restaurant is no longer BYOB, and the staff seemed to not remember ever being BYOB such that they wanted a $10 corking fee for the bottle of wine I brought
Disappointingly, they now seem to have a full bar complete with the usual crummy, mass produced Californians at 4x-5x markup
The food, as many say, was good and flavorful, though I don't think it deserves the Zagat's 27 (I'm thinking more like a 23)
In any case, I would definately recommend trying it if you're going to be in Queens, but otherwise I'm not sure it's worth the trip out there
IF YOU LIKE GREAT THAI FOOD THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO
ONLY NEGATIVE THING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS THE WAIT
If you ask most Thai people who live in and around the city to list the top 5 Thai restaurants in New York, I would think that Sripaphai would be on at least 7 out of 10 lists
Food is authentic, it's prepared well, it's prepared quickly, and you'll be left with a couple of extra $$$ in your wallet
Tough to get nice ambience in that section of Woodside, but no one really goes here for a romantic dinner
Before you pay pick up some Thai desserts at the counter
Writing this review has made me hungry
see you at Sripaphai
Yes it's
After more than 10 years with BYOB(Bring your own beer) Now Liquor license has come
You don't have to go buying beer at grocery store anymore
We offer SINGHA,HEINEKEN,AMSTEL LIGHT,CORONA,BUDWEISER,BUD LIGHT at very reasonable price
Half a dozen of SINGHA for just 24$ !!! For more Info,please visit our restaurant
:)
I was delighted to find this little gem of a Thai restaurant just blocks from my home in Sunnyside
The food is excellent across the board, from green curry to red
The papaya salad is wonderful, and best of all, everything on the menu is less than $8
a steal! Just don't expect to find it if you don't know where it is
there's no awning, nothing to indicate that hidden inside this unassuming building is an amazing taste treat! They've updated the interior too for a much more pleasant dining experience!
About 10 years ago, Sriprapai was like the only good Thai restaurant in Queens that had value and quality
In the last three years we've seen many American's and other nationalities flocking to Sriprapai
And with good reviews in the Zagat and City Search who wouldn't? Since it's renovation, Sriprapai is now bigger and has a trendy touch to it
For the Thai's it's considered an ok place but you probably won't see many Thai's eating there anymore
Due to the large American Patrons and other foreigners Sriprapai's dishes are now suited more for the Americans than they are for Thai's
Certain dishes are not spicy enough and the flavor is just not right
Perhaps with this being said, Sriprapai will remember that it was the Thai's that helped them make it this far 10 years ago and in return will acquire the taste that the Thai's long for
This place has the best Thai food ever! They just renovated so it looks like a Manhattan restaurant
Better get there early (early dinner) because the there's always a wait to get seated but the wait is well worth it!
Very very good thai food - authentic, delicious and very very spicy
The decor and the service definitely is not the greatest, but I can overlook those things since their food is just so damn good
Especially love the drunken noodles and the coconut soup!!
Here's the scoop: The signs says the restaurant closes at 10 pm, and the kitchen closes at 9:15, however, if you're not there by 9:00 pm, you're out of luck, they won't let you in!! We've been turned away before closing time on several occasions, which is NEVER good business
The only thing it has going for it is that the food is delicious
Unfortunately, being repeatedly and unapologetically turned away has led us to taking our business elsewhere
Coming from a thai person, I can truly say this is one of the only authentic, good thai food restaurants that you can find in NYC
try the single noodle dishes such as kuay teow kua kai, or pad see ew
Or try the soft shell crab salad or crispy duck salad
Dont judge thai restaurant by only the green curry as the review said
Barely any thai person will order that when going out to eat
Be adventurous and try anything that looks remotely interesting
you wont be disappointed
This comfy hole-in-the-wall is a bit hard to find but totally worth it! The Crispy Fried soft shell crabs are DELICIOUS and their curry is awesome
My family and I enjoy spicy food so towards the end of the meal, we were tearing and had runny noses
I recommend it to anyone who enjoys authentic Thai food
YUM!
Excellent, excellent food
I've finally found a Thai place where when they ask you if you want the food mild, medium or spicy, and you tell them spicy, it actually is hot

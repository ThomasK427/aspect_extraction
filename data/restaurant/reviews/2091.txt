I highly recommend it
The space is airy and light, with tall windows stretching from floor almost to ceiling
Beautiful shoppers and west village residents walk by as the smell of grease and fermented soy swirl around the room
The space is great- it is the food of which I am not as keen
The problem begins at the menu, an awkward jumble of dishes that fail to appetize and have no description of the dish you will be served
I ordered takeout several times- vegetraian dumplings were oversized and stuffed with a bland, wet filling that was only saved by a liberal dunking in their soy and vinegar ponzu-like rinse
The dough was chewy and tough and my noodles were not much better
I found that my only option was to sprinkle hot sauce and chili flakes accross the thick, doughy noodles to make them appetizing
The ladies who work here are very sweet and I have alwyas had my take-out ready in minutes, yet I cannot justify another below-par meal for the friendly service and great location
My bf and I call this the Chinese diner - the place is huge, airy and nearly empty all the time
The hostesses are sweet yet efficient, and your table is mysteriously set and stocked with water, tea and veggies while you're still sitting down
Food comes (LITERALLY) within 5 minutes of ordering
That's on a slow day
Your check comes seconds after you've taken the last yummy bite and you're outta there
The menu is half the size of your typical Ollie's, but everything is solid, huge and such a great value
I absolutely LOVE the noodles soups from this restaurant
The veggies are always extremely fresh and crisp, but the general fare tends to be extremely fatty
The speed of delivery is unsurpassed! It was a running joke in our old apt that we'd time when we ordered and within 6 minutes the food was at our door!! (I'm not kidding here!)
Sick of take-out Chinese food joints? Mama Buddha is a good alternative to most of the random Chinese restaurants in the city
Featuring a nice collection of noodle soups, a decent vegetarian food selection, and dishes that aren't laden in sauces, Mama Buddha is a veritable institution on Hudson Street
The place is busy for dinner, and even during lunch, when diners come in for their specials
Thankfully, the place is large enough to accommodate a lot of people comfortably
Everything here is very fresh, especially the vegetables
Lunch specials are a good value
Highly recommend the ginger chicken
This place WAS one of my favorite places to have parties and take friends
THEN
They rennovated and turned into something terrible
Don't listen to any of the other reviews before 2006 because they are all talking about something that does not exist
They USED to have large portions,reasonable prices, friendly waitstaff, fun vybe and strong drinks
NOW they are just another slick wanna be hip, cold,unfriendly, ultra modern, small portioned, leaving you hungry, weak drinked, dissapointment
THEY KILLED DAY-O!!! the cool swaying palm tree and fun ethnic artwork has been replaced with flat pannel televisions!!! DISCRACEFUL! And a cold white bright very modern feeling
They used to have a romantic vibe
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BIG DELICIOUS PORTIONS? The Drinks tasted WATERED DOWN!!  All of the good places are gone
Now the good places are turning into something they are not
I always dine at Day-O b/c the food is FABULOUS! The service is always great, waiters are friendly and prompt
The portions are huge and the taste
well I am always more than satisfied! The decor adds to the cozy, chic atmosphere
It can get crowded which may mean a wait, but it certainly worth the wait! The prices are fair for what is offered
It is theonly place I take out-of-town friends and family
I'm never dissapointed when I leave Day-o's
The food is always great and the weekend brunches are the perfect midday meal
Don't leave without trying the Rum Punch
whoah!!
This unassuming little Chinese restaurant has some surprisingly tasty treats behind its doors
Though we went more often when they still had a sidewalk license, due to the shoddy decor, we still do the occasional take-out
I highly recommend the BBQ Spare Ribs (and the watercress they're served on), the salt and pepper shrimp and the szechuan tofu
The soups and noodles are somewhat hit or miss
Great little neighborhood place
I've been enjoying the food and atmosphere at Jarnac for years now
I am so happy to say that they've resolved the only minor dining inconvenience at the restaurant
NEW AIR CONDITIONING!! It is extremely pleasant to eat at Jarnac during the hotter months of New York's summer which has made Jarnac the perfect spot for Sunday brunch or a summer evening out
The Jarnac BLT with pancetta and heirloom tomatoes is back and out of this world! I highly recommend it
Chose this place at random and was very pleasantly surprised
The food was great! The wait staff were attentive and friendly
I have not been this pleased with a restaurant in a long time
Having dined out in NYC for close to nine years now, Jarnac, a corner bistro we happened into about a year ago left us very pleasantly surprised
Absolutely *delicious* French fare (yum factor of 10), friendly and attentive wait staff, and an extremely warm environment make Jarnac the perfect place to have an intimate dinner
We were impressed by how comfortable it felt- like we'd been dining there for years
MUSTS: the Duck Rillettes, Grilled Rib Eye, BLT Jarnac with the Heirloom tomatoes
And until recently, we hadn't realized that Jarnac also gives a totally killer brunch
Noteworthy is its Chocolate Cherry French Toast which is to die for
a bit pricey
it's well worth the sight of your slightly thinner wallet
This is a quiet place with magnificent cuisine, a fantastic host, and quite possibly the best money spent on a romantic anniversary or special, yet intimate, occassion
For me, it is the epitome of special occassion dinner with a reasonable price value for an exquisite meal
Best dinner plate - the duck confit when its in season!
I went to JARNAC on Wednesday night with my friend- and we both loved it
Romantic atmosphere, exceptionally good food, friendly and prompt service
The host makes you feel at home
It is hard to find something that authentic- even in New York!
We were shocked to find out that a special menu meant a $75 prix fixe that consisted of an appetizer (this salmon thing that tasted like salmon pate from the grocery store), a main course (falafel + scallops??), a glass of bubbly (NOT champagne), and dessert (two cookies, a stale tart, and super stale mini muffin with frosting)
This was quite deceptive on the restaurant's part and they were blatantly taking advantage of Valentine's day
They were getting people in and out as fast as they could
My boyfriend feels terrible about ruining our first valentine's day ever
Despite the delicious food and good service, we could not enjoy ourselves whatsoever because we felt like we were sitting in a sauna! We could not even finish our dinner
I recommend this restaurant, but do NOT go during a heatwave!!
Consistently excellent and satisfying seasonal menu, from blanquette de veau in spring to cassoulet in winter
Lighter fare just as pleasing
Wine selection is very good
Service friendly but not intrusive
True Bistro feeling on a lovely West Village corner
I loved this cute restaurant
The chef visited us several times and we were given champagne on the house
The stuffed artichokes and rib eye were great
A very intimate setting
When last in New York, I was a bit late on the ball in making dinner reservations for a Saturday night
After some searching I found this place and was surprised by the friendly voice on the phone who managed to work us in at 7:30
When we arrived, it was a bit empty but filled up quickly with what seemed to be many repeat customers
We were seated promptly and had full attentive service the entire meal from the host, all servers, and he chef herself
The Steak Diane and the skate we both wonderful and perfectly prepared
The wine list is large and varied, including some non-French wines
The pace of the meal was perfect and never rushed
The room is tiny and intimate, but sparsely decorated
I would have liked a bit more charm in the space
Overall, a great find
We went on an early Thursday night, and the place was surprisingly empty
The staff was extremely attentive and helpful
The duck confit was delicious! If you want to have dinner after 9pm, definitely make a reservation
The food was excellent (we had the halibut and the braised lamb), service was courteous and friendly, and the prices were great

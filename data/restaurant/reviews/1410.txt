their takeout menu lists the ingredients in each dish
however, for the money, we got soup, an appetizer, main course, dessert, and tea, all of which was delicious; some of the best middle eastern i've eaten
we'll definitely go back
Hands down, one of the best-kept secrets in NYC
Though not a well-trafficked scene after the work-lunch-buffet crowd goes home, Yatra offers fine Indian dining all day at this 31st St location
The setting IS ROMANTIC and peaceful-- with candles lit at every table and staff catering to customers in nuanced seemingly genuine ways-- Yatra is definitely underrated as far as this critic is concerned
For lunch and dinner, I really recommend it:)
The food here is fantastic and this is a great spot when you're in the mood for something different
Great first dinner date spot or small group
Recommend getting a shared platter and try the honey wine! My friends found this place and we keep going back
However the service is so-so and the last time I was there we were practically sitting in the dark
This little coffehouse tucked away on Chambers street is a great place for any coffee loving person who would like to be served by an extremely friendly and talented staff, enjoy free Wifi, and great music
The espresso drinks are fabulously prepared and the HH Bagels are delicious
You can sit in the place for hours and the staff will make you feel at home
Best coffee house I have found yet in Tribeca
Highly recommended!
There are your average run-of-the-mill coffee shops and then there are places where you can tell the owner took the time to make their customers feel at home
Blue Spoon Coffee is one of those places
The coffee is great and the owner is pretty cute too! I think they only opened about a month ago
The first time I just happened to walk by on my lunch break so I stopped in
The second time I sat in the place with my laptop (they have free WiFi)
I dont think Ive ever heard the Replacements in a coffee shop before!
I adore their cream puffs with fresh sliced fruit
Everything tastes homemade here
Quince and white chocolate cupcakes are a find
I LOVE this place
They don't skimp on their ingredients, that's for sure
It's real food, wholesome food, and I appreciate their understanding of flavor combinations
It's like eating in my Mom's kitchen, just way cooler
And I just love those paolitos, small brazilian cheese breads loaded with english cheddar, porcini and truffle oil, vidalia onion, jalapeno, chinese sausage and ginger, lots of others
My brother has a wheat allergy and the paolitos are naturally wheat free so I send him packages regularly
Their sweets are interesting too: parisian macaroons, bourbon lime pralines, and nanaimo bars I miss from the Northwest
Yum
My birthday at Via was a great experience
The owner promised my party a table and bottle service and took care of it immediately as we all arrived
He even approached me and got us a round of shots
Overall everything was very accomodating
Some friends and I went bar hopping last saturday night and stumbled upon Via
We ended up staying here until 4am! We danced the whole night because of the great music
Crowd wasnt too shaby either
Between the rude staff, poor service, and lack of sound system, this place needs help
If you do end up going here, have some of the food and make your way down the block to a better venue with hotter people, better service, and good music
The location is strange, but the interior nice
The servers and manager, total airheads
Pasta was hard and undercooked
Would have been a nice place to just go for drinks if it wasn't so hot
We were fanning ourselves with the menus all night
You would think for how over priced the food is, they would at least splurge on air conditioning
Nice place, that is if u enjoy sweating your butt off!
Went there to party this past saturday night and had a blast! Definitely worth checking out - celebrated a friends birthday and the place made us feel like VIPs
Music was amazing and people friendly
Will go back for sure for another saturday night outing
Went for a friend's birthday, started the night off with the people at the door being very rude, we had table service and had to wait 20 mins
to get our 1st bottle, and the service was terrible
I would never recommend this place
The food was over priced and unremarkable, and the service was terrible
We were comped nothing even though it was my friend's birthday
Not that I would expect to be, but I see that many other reviewers were, so I just wanted to set the record straight, there
I really, really do not recommend this place
WENT TO VIA LAST NGHT FOR DINNER WITH FEW OF MY GIRLZ
THIS PLACE IS GREAT!THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AND THE SERVICE WAS FANTASTIC! THE MANAGER ANTHONY (tall guy shaved head)TREATED US LIKE V
I
P'S HE BOUGHT US A ROUND OF SHOTS AND MADE US FEEL REALLY WELCOME
THIS PLACE HAS A BEAUTIFUL DECOR AND NICE VIBE
THE PRICES ARE SO GOOD ESPECIALLY FOR MANHATTAN
WE DONT UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE BAD REVIEWS THIS PLACE HAS
WE HAD A GREAT TIME
ANTHONY TOLD US THAT ON FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS THEY ARE OPEN LATE NIGHT AND TURN INTO A FULL LOUNGE WITH MUSIC
ME AND THE GIRLZ ARE DEFINITELY COMING THIS WEEKEND TO PARTY!!
Went for dinner with a friend, the place seems like it is not sure what it wants to be
A lounge or restaurant or club
The food was ok, good bread
but the service was very poor
The waitress seemed confused and out of it all night
The manager gave us free drink tickets, but they all seemed so disorganized
The decor is cool, nice design
The bathroom situation is awful
Two co ed stalls?? It is ridiculous
It has potential, but they need to improve before they loose business
The penne alla via was scrumptious and the service is prompt and accomodating
The drinks were reasonably priced, considering this is a spot in the city
There are some specialty drinks, but the Rioja is fantabulous
I enjoyed my dinner and had a great time with my girls
I will definitley go back for seconds
The pizza was delicious, and all the other little snacky appetizers too
I thought from the street this place looked small, but it was really spacious and cute inside
Thanks guys for a great bday party
Things could not off went smoother
My guests really enjoyed themselves, especially the hassle free door! I will be glad to recommend your place to anyone
My company, Avenue A-Razorfish, had a event at Via last night and I cannot tell you the raves that everyone has been giving me today for introducing them to a place that the food is really good, the drinks are worth the money and they treat you like family
I highly reconmend for you to come downtown or uptown and check this cute little spot out-you won't regret it
I often eat dinner at Via's, I love the italian dishes, love the romantic setting , love the late night crowd
Great place to go with a large group or just with your mate
I highly recomend it
I had a really incredible night at Via for my 25th birthday party
We went to Prey last Saturday, and I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the crowd, the drinks, the staff and the vibe there
It seems like places in the city are getting so cheesy and its getting harder and harder to find a place where you can bring all your friends, know that they will all get in, have a great night and meet a bunch of other great people
Just thought I'd pass on the info
From dinner to throwing a b-day party here, it was a nightmare
Everything went wrong

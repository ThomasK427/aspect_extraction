However, there are too many service people in suits wandering around
Also a complete waste of a nice view of Central Park blocked by the kitchen so all diners can enjoy is mediocre uninspired decor
All in all nothing special
I went there for lunch with my mom, it was just excellent, the sole and cremed spinach dish I had was divine
The art deco design is well done and they were able to keep a warm feel throughout the resturant as well, which can be lost easily
The view is outstanding and the open kitchen is a nice touch
the appetizers were amazing, but i wasn't that impressed with the entree
The wines by the glass were mediocre, at best (chardonnay from the finger lakes area? no thanks!)
best to go for the appetizers
The Scene Tucked inside David Rockwell's minimalist, sleek hotel, the restaurant is fittingly modern and dramatic, with a swooping staircase, bare lightbulbs hanging from lofty ceilings and plush, curving banquettes
The space, however, is oddly arranged: There's a low-ceilinged dining room upstairs, another more lively one in the rear and an abbreviated sushi bar dug into a narrow hall
Service ranges from excellent to neglectful
The Food  Marcus Samuelsson and executive chef Johan Svensson emphasize the decadence of Japanese fare, whether in the form of spiced, lush coconut milk surrounding perfectly seared char or a thick layer of melting, honey-glazed skin on the pork belly
Though the fish itself is of high quality, the sushi menu--like the sushi bar itself--seems like an afterthought, as rolls arrive off-temperature and without the usual accoutrements
Desserts, including a tough chocolate pancake and a gritty cheesecake shmear accompanying an otherwise delicious roast pineapple, are disappointing
Delicious food, excellent service, knowledgable staff, and charming space
I've been going back to this restaurant many times and had very pleasant dining expererience every single time- though I am a very picky person when it comes to quality of service and food
I am a major foodie and have been to many new restaurants serving Japanese/Asian influenced fusion cuisine, and Riingo still remains as my solid favorite
Some of my favorites are Chicken dumplings, Braised pork belly, King crab roll, Shrimp tempura roll, and incredibly rich Warm chocolate cake
Delicious and creative specialty cocktails, too
The portions were extremely small, spent a fortune and left still HUNGRY!! Plenty of other places to go spend your money and get bigger and better meal
We were 45 mins late but still seated promptly in the back dining room
Friday night at 9:45 it wasn't crowded
They have an upstairs dining room but didnt see it
Ambience is somewhat modern like the video projection of the an animated candle on the wall
Designed to excite and impress but felt short on my ratings
Young chef Samuelsson has an impressive resume
Food is influenced by chef's previous experience of working in different cuisines but you could see mainly Japanese inspired dishes
Seafood was good but I didnt think it was exceptional
I found the wine list to be pricy with somewhat limited selections
Overall dining experience was above average and I would recommend it but I wasn't very excited
I would probably go back to try other dishes but not in a hurry when there are so many new places to try
I dined at riingo on friday dec
2nd and i fell in love with the atmosphere, food and drinks
The restaurant was busy however not once did our server make us feel that he was too busy to make our night great
The winelist was great and the food was even better
Our server recomended the right wine with our sushi
We all enjoyed everything however what we enjoyed the most was the rice puff crusted shrimp roll
The location of the restaurant was a little out of our way, since most of us live downtown, which didnt matter once we got there
Overall we all left happy and was totally worth the cab ride to midtown
I never eat above 14th street, but friends of mine dragged me along anyway
I'm glad they did, because this restaurant is definately a find
The sushi is extremely fresh, and their king crab avocado roll is out of this world
My friends dined on the lobster tempura roll and the toro daikon, both are worth every penny
I also recommend the bass, and the ny strip was cooked to perfection
The atmosphere was perfect for my friends and I, but I think boys who want to impress their girls should definately check it out as well
Our waiter was well versed with the menu and provided us with great service, he didn't hover over the table as some servers tend to do in high end restaurants
Ask a host or a manager to show you the great wine room up in the mezzanine
A friend had told me about Riingo explaining how I had to go and try the Scallop roll which he said and I quote It is out of this world
I went with a friend for dinner last week and I was blown away
The restaurant itself is beautiful , very clean and modern
The service was very good
We sat in the lounge before dinner and both had the baked apple martini which was delicious
Our server was so polite and knowledgable (on wine)a joy!!!We then sat for dinner
My friend was so right, scallop roll was so unbelievable and the tuna entree served on beef cheek dumplings could'nt have been better
The whole experience was amazing and I can't wait to go back and try other entree's on the menu ( a couple really caught my eye)
What a specail place !!
I'll begin at the beginning
The octopus appetiser was tired, overcooked, and seemed like the only reason it ended up on our plate was cause it was too inept to avoid capture in the first place
Salmon ceviche was nothing to write home about
In between courses, one of the servers (there were several as the night wore on, apparently confused as to their roles) removed our forks and placed them back on the table
I'm sorry, but for a buck sixty for two, I expect fresh silverware
Interestingly, they did take away the knives, perhaps because I was beginning to look peeved
The burger that the Village Voice loved so much was overcooked
Steak salad good, if overseasoned
The final insult came during dessert, when they turned the lights all the way up, perturbing the remaining customers
Then a lady came in and waved a remote at the ceiling
We came here in the evening without a reservation
The restaurant was completely booked, so they opened a private room for us
We had three waiters serve the table
They were a bit clumsy and dropped some things along the way
However, they really tried to accommodate
The bread was very good though the flat bread is very spicy
The spread was very good
Both the Cod and the Halibut were excellent
The food has definite Japanese influence
Overall, we left very pleased
My boyfriend and I LOVED it! The decor is amazing, the music wasn't too loud, and the video art is interesting, but not obtrusive
Try the the spring roll with foie gras and pickled watermelon
Fantastic
The lobster tempura roll was definitely the best sushi roll we have ever had
The lobster was still hot and juicy, and the other ingredients complemented it so well
Try the NY Strip steak with country bacon french toast
I am not a big steak eater, but this one had so much flavor! All of the drinks that we tried were As for desserts, my favorite is the chocolate cake and my boyfriend really liked their pumpkin cheesecake
Notice the 4 x $ signs in the left column on this page
It isn't cheap, but you get great food
Not your run-of-the-mill Asian fusion
The caesar salad was a huge bowl of iceberg lettuce, a dressing that wasn't ceasar, 1 crouton and a few slices of thin chicken -- for $12
00 -- rip off
Don't order a mixed drink -- 1 martini $14
00
It was a friday night when i 1st went to riingo

They also have a very friendly staff
Whenever I have friends or family visiting from out of town, the Eatery is on my list of places to take them
Aside from the food, which is wonderfully varried and beyond deliciuos (have the meatloaf), the atmosphere is friendly, welcoming and chic at the same time
The Eatery serves up more than a great meal, sit outside, for a comfortable seat to people watch on 9th ave while enjoying your Watermelon Martini and Grilled Salmon Salad
Leave room for dessert
I suggest the chocolate-bannana spring rolls
What can I say about this place
from the tatooed bearded muscle cub of a manager to the cute dark haired host and a waitstaff that is a feast for the eyes with the rock and roll guy, the muscle boy with a mohawk the california blonde, the fairskined irish boy and our waiter with the big arms and equally big persoanlitiy I didn't think things could get much better but as I looked around the dinning room at the crowd I was equally impressed with the Broadway celebs, chorus kids and tv persoanlities peppered through out
THIS PLACE IS A GAY MAN'S DREAM Then on top of everything the food is great, love the blackened mahi mahi and don't even get me started on the watermelon martini
The only thing that could have made this place perfection was better music
Do yourself a favor and try this restaurant
Beware, the Asian Chicken salad is highly addictive and should have a warning lable on it
This salad is even good after a night in the fridge
All the other food is great too
I have even seen a few celeb chefs eating there as well (shhhhh!)
Eatery is the best restaurant in Hell's Kitchen
The chef has put together a wonderful menu with fantastic and varied choices that will please anyone
The atmosphere is very hip and cool to go along with a staff that creates a fun and relaxed atmosphere
Go there as fast as you can!
Eatery is a great place for Bruch
The menu has a great variety and the food is excellent
The staff was very attentive to detail and I would Highly recommend Eatery to anyone wanting to have a casual (not to mention reasonobly priced) brunch
The eatery is an easy dining choice to make
The restaurant is simple, clean, and spacious
So many choices make it easy for my friends and I to all find something on the menu
The service is attentive, and the staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and attractive
They are quick to seat you and tend to your needs
I like being able to order an interesting martini without feeling like I'm bothering the bartender!! They've got the basic classics, but they kick them up a notch
There's a large assortment of salads, sammies, burgers, and entrees (like Mac and Jack Cheese, or Pesto-Pork Tenderloin with Melon-Prosciutto Salad)
Like Mom made, but with a twist
which makes it worth the trip away from your own kitchen
i can't say enough about this hell's keithen hot spot
good looking staff, great food, and has a great patio for outside dining
i bring all my friends, and they all love it
you never know who you are going to see there
trendy with out every one in nyc knowing about it
go have a great time and tell them i sent you
This is my favorite pre-theatre spot! If ever I'm in midtown I stop by, if I don't have time to eat, you can bet that I'll have a cran-apple martini!! The vibe is great, the servers are hip and effecient, and the food is AMAZING!!!! If you are in midtown, it would be criminal not to go to the eatery
Eatery is by far my favorite place in midtown
I eat thier food atleast 3 times a week wether it's delivery or in the restaurant
The food is always great love the sashimi tuna
It's the perfect place to go with friends and out of town guests
The staff is always friendly and attentive, not to mention attractive, and treat me and my friends like one of the gang
And the drinks are always great
I can't tell you how many nights i had to many cranapple martinis and now I'm addicted to the new pear martini
Next time you are in midtown go in for dinner, the clientel is attractive and diverse and very New York
Don't miss out on the fun
Just be sure to make a reservation this place is always busy
A NYC must!! This Midtown spot is my favorite place in NYC
The food is fantastic, the prices are reasonable, and the drinks are creative and yummy
It's trendy but not uptight
The servers are attentive(and easy on the eyes) and the place as whole makes for great night out! But dont forget the cheap lunch pre fix!! and why not eat outside!! How cool is that!! Even the music is sexy
There are so many places on 9th to eat, but eatery is outstanding
We got there early, only a few tables were full, but by the time we left it was packed and with good reason
The signature Mac Jack is wonderful with a crispy crust topped with those perfect frizzled onions
Mamma never made it this good
The Sashimi Tuna also sublime
Save room for dessert and only order 1 they can be easily shared
Every dish that passed by our table we wanted to try, and the most reasonably priced wine list I have seen in years! I can't wait to go back again and again
The service was top notch even when it got pre-theatre busy
I'm telling everyone I know to eat at eatery!
Il ristorante piccolo e bello, ma il mio marito migliori

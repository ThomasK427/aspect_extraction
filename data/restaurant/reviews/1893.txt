The salmon was very tastey and the sushi was very good
My only minus on the place
and if you are a fan of my posts you know I always have one, is that the smoked salmon sushi was too smoked
It hardend one side
I hope to be back
If you are in the back room, must of the blue hairs don't know that they sushi people jaw at you when you leave and arrive b/c you need to show them RESPECT and bow
Most giggle and laugh
Have been going here for years and have always enjoyed outstanding food and service
There are cheaper places, but for the quality and atmosphere (and beautiful staff) I think it's totally worth it
They have always been very helpful about last-minute reservations and special occasions, too, which is definitely a big plus
I recommend sitting in the sushi bar area so you can watch the chefs - it's a lot of fun
The food (sushi, the bass, tuna
yum!) and drinks (saketinis!) were wonderful
The decor was gorgeous and very zen-like
The restaurant even had an elevator
The place was packed
The hosts/hostesses looked like aspiring models/actresses
We made reservations and they called us up to offer us better seating, so that was a nice gesture
Our waitress unfortunately wasn't so great
She was a bit of an ice queen
Not the cheapest, but certainly very good
Real Sushi enthuisiasts should dine upstairs, as the menu selection and service is much better
Downstairs, with the lighter menu, and uncomfortable seating, is only worthwhile if people watching and the energy of the bar scene is more important to you than the food
Either up or down, they have been consistent during my 8 visits over three year period
I recently dined at Bond St
for my 3 year anniversary
The food was top notch
I highly recommend the sea bass, it was sooooo good
Despite what I read about the service; our waiter went above and beyond to make us feel very special
Without any prompting on my part he brought out my girlfriends desert with a candle and he had the cook right happy anniversary on the plate in chocolate sauce
This made her night and made our getaway weekend absolutely perfect
THE FOOD AND SERVICE WERE UNBELIEVABLE! THIS IS A GREAT DATE SPOT! Price was not as bad as I thought
Our bill was around $200 including tip
I heard a lot about this place and finally decided to give it a try
I found the atmosphere to be very romantic
unlike all the couples around me, I was not on a date, but I still enjoyed myself
The Chilean sea bass is to die for
Our waiter was very friendly too
I would definitely recommend this restaurant
I have been here probably 10 times with friends and family, have had some pretty lousy service, but the food made up for it
Also went here for sake-bombers late one night and had a lot of fun
the bartender was super-hot
Absolutely stand-out food, and if you stick to one drink you can have a great meal of appetizers and rolls for under $100: my favorites are the apicy tuna-the best spicy sauce, orange shrip tempura with curry mayo, and surprisingly the sun-dried tomato and avacado rolls is really excellent
Also try the goat-cheese crab cakes
Call ahead or eat at the sushi bar
its always busy
ordered the chef's tasting menu but is a grade lower than nobu's
i found some of the sauces to be a tad bit salty and the quality of the sushi was so-so
however, the desserts were very good as well as the sake selection
instead of the chef's tasting menu, order a couple of rolls and appetizers and you'll be set
the ambience was very nice although they turned down the lighting all of a sudden
the bar downstairs was convenient with good service - they could expand their saketini menu though
I came here with a friend -- we were both STARVING -- we had reservations and we arrived over an hour early
They immediately accomodated us
Free edamame (nice perk) and we ordered four rolls between the two of us, and each of us had a drink
The rolls and dipping sauces were amongst the top 3 I've ever had in the world (yes, world)
We were absolutely stuffed after we ate all of them (in fact, we ended up wasting a few pieces which was the only upsetting part)
The bill came out to $35 each, including a really good tip, so it's not as expensive as people may think
Staff was friendly as well -- our waiter was chatting with us for a bit after we paid (we definitely were not rushed out)
i love this place! i love this place! i love this place! i love this place!  bond st
is consistently good !! and that's why i keep coming back !
I Was There Yesterday On My 1st Date And It Was GREEEAATT, The Waiter was a Snob early in the night but at the end of the night he came around, the Lobster Tempura, Spicy Tuna And Avacado Rolls Were To Die For
YUMMY!! As Far As Cost I Was On A date So He Paid, But I Think The Service Was Great , It's A Good Looking Place A Little Bit Dark
I'll BE BACK!!
I heard this restaurant is so good, but I didn't think so
It may be good for drinking, but sushi was not good at all
However it's very expensive
If you want to eat sushi, do not go there, go to other sushi restaurants
Table on top-of-each-other environment so you're closer to the person sitting next to you than the person you're with
Great for conversation, not
Worse yet, the sushi was disappointing at best
Quality was marginal and size of pieces makes you pull out your microscope
All for a cool two Ben Franklin's for two people
This place ain't gotta clue
Walk right by it next time you're in the neighborhood
i had dinner here last night with my friends
I liked the ambiance, food
we had lobster tempura, crispy spicy shrimp, toro tartar, some kind of kobe beef and many different kinds (about 20)of sushi and sashimi
you have to order a lot because the portion of dish is very small
and ordered steak and some steam fish as Entree(don't remember the exact name of these two entree, because my friend ordered for us)
I LIKED EVERYTHING I TASTED
THE WAITER WAS NOT PATIENT enough for us to finish each dishes
He kept asking us if he could take away the dishes we did not finished
That was a bit annoying
Conclusion: GREAT FOOD, but VERY SMALL PORTION and PRICEY
I left almost hungry after eating so many different dishes
Bill came out to be more than $150 per person with two bottle of wine
I WOULD GO BACK
the food at Bond Street does not fit the scenery
My friends and I ordered an Omakase (12 pieces of sushi selected by the Chef) and I was definitely dissapointed
First of all, the size of each sushi was uncommonly small
Why so small? I guess I'm paying for the atmosphere, which seductive and chic
A geat place to take your first date but not a place to fill your appetite
A full course meal of two appetizers, omakase, and dessert left me yearning for a can of Campbell's New England Chowder
A great place to be seen at but it is nothing more than that
The hype drew me in but the emptiness of my stomach drew me out
Once in a lifetime deal and I'm glad I experience it when I am still young
My girlfriend and I ate downstairs and she loved it and I thought it was pretty good
Sushi was excellent
Wasnt that much of a bargain

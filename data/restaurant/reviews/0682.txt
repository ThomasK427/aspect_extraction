The wine was delicious as well
The prices were very moderate for what we had
We are planning another dinner at Cascina already
I highly recommend the restaurant
My boyfriend, who is Italian, took me here for the first time a few months ago
We have been regulars ever since
The restaurant is so cozy and romantic
The food is amazing
Pizza from the wood-burning brick oven is the best in town
It's our little romantic get-away : )
We loved our pre theater dinner so much, we decided to drop in after the theater and have some dessert and wine
The tiramisu was out of this world delicious
I never had tiramisu like that
We also had some homemade mixed berry tart, which was absolutely amazing
They have great selection of dessert wines, very nice
We had a great time, talking about the play in a nice, cozy, peaceful environment
The dinner pre-theater was excellent too
I tried the fish, that everyone is raving about - it is that good
My husband had the veal and loved it, my friends had pastas and pizza
Everyone loved their foood
The after theater dessert was calm and divine
This close from the theater, Cascina is a real find
We love it and will be back frequently
We have a play date next month!!! We all recommend it strongly
We are theater lovers, so we dine pre-theater often and in the theater distric it's hard to find a reasonably priced, cozy restaurant, that doesn't serve mediocre food and doesn't push you out the door
Well, my friend recommended Cascina and what a delight!!! It's a warm and inviting with heavy wooden tables and a wood burning brick oven
They serve traditional country-style Italian, kind of my grandma's cooking, very authentic and flavorful
The portions are generous
The pizza from the brick oven is wonderful, so is the fish
Try the delicious homemade deserts
I loved the pear tart
Everything is very reasonably priced and delicious
Try the wines, really good and a good value
Lastly, the service is very friendly and fast, not pushy
You won't feel rushed out
This is our new pre-theater tradition
We've already been back 3 times and will be back for more
Truely wonderful!
After reading some reviews we decided to try Cascina
Thank you, we compeletelly agree: the fish here is exquisite!!! Go for the fish and the pizza
Try tiramisu - amazing
Ambience was great, cozy! Service great, professional and fast
I definate GO!
I got a gift certificate, so I took me husband here before going to the theater
We had a wonderful experience
Everyone was so friendly and nice
The hostess seated us on a balcony in the back
The restaurant is beautifully decorated with cozy, rustic feel to it
There is a actual wood-burning oven in the middle of the main room
The pizza comming out of that over is amazing
My husband had the striped bass, and I see some reviewer wrote about it already, but he raved about it
I tried some myself and I agree, delicious
The wine was very good and fairly inexpensive
The service was quick
We were ready right in time for the theater 2 blocks away
We will be back
I highly recommend it especially for pre-theater
It's hard to find an affordable, decent place that won't rush you out, well here's one!
On a friend's recommendation, we tried to go for the pre-theater dinner here recently and had a wonderful meal
I agree with most of the reviewer, I had their solomon with white wine and loved it
My husband had the steak and really liked it
The wait staff was pleasant with a no-nonsense attitude and great wine recommendation
The restaurant has its own wine lable and terrifc wines at that
The ambience is another plus; cozy and romantic
We will be back
I highly recommend it
I took my girlfriend to Cascina for Valentine's dinner and it delivered
The atmosphere is very cozy and romantic
The brick wood-burning oven stuck in the middle of the room gives it a rustic, pleasant feel
The food is superb
The pizza is great, the ossobuco phenomenal and the wine really great
The staff is wonderful, very friendly and knowledgable, especially about wines
The prices are friendly to your wallet
Overall, it's a great value all served up in a beautiful, romantic atmosphere
I highly recommend it!
What a wonderful, cozy, romantic restaurant
My husband took me here for a romantic dinner this weekend, it was glorious
Spectacular chicken, my husband had the pasta with seafood and loved it
We both enjoyed the wine, wonderful and from their own vineyard in Italy
Just a really great and romantic dinner
We got away from the kids and the craziness of the city without leaving it
I highly recommend Cascina for romantic departures from the ordinary!
I took my wife to Cascina for Valentine's Day dinner on my sister's recommendation
It was spectacular
The restaurant is warm and very romantic with a big brick oven in the middle
It reminded us of a place in the Alps where we go skiing
The food is so good here
My wife had the pizza, really good
I had the steak, it was very good
The wine was excellent
Service was attentive and fast
We had a great time
I highly recommend it
I agree with one of the reviewers about the fish, incredible
If you love fish, you will appreciate this dish
The striped bass (they call it here branzino) amazing
I wonder about the bad service, the other reviewer mentioned
We had a great experience
In fact, my friend's steak, ordered medium/rare, came more on a medium side than rare, but the waiter speedily took it back, and brought it back more rare and he loved it
Our waiter was very good and attentive

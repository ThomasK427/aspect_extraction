i went there after reading all the comments here
and yes, i wasn't disappointed
try sampling of tapas ($15), which will feed 2-3 ppl
you will get about 10 different kinds of tapas! and they are all so yummy
main dish was great as well
i had mashroom pasta
and my bf picked from today's special, grilled sea bass
it was cooked to perfection
seasoning was simple yet flavorful
staff here was very friendly and attentive
only thing was he didn't have much knowledge of wine, and had to ask someone when i asked for suggestion
very reasonable price for such good foods
The cuisine of Venice is created in this great location
The appetizer consisting of little tapas was excellent
Dessert menu offered a large selection of great sweets
Friendly staff guaranteed enjoyable meal
What a great place! Lot's of outdoor seating and the first floor inside is virtually outside when the large glass doors are open
Service was great
very attentive and knowledgeable
Extensive menu and lot's of interesting specials
I had the horseradish encrusted salmon for a main dish and shrimp cakes for an appetizer
Also had an artichoke appetizer that was like candy! And all for a very reasonable price
Beer on tap too
Will definitely go back
so many interesting items on the menu to try!
One of our more memorable recent meals on the LES, this restaurant is a keeper with a winning combination of delicious food, variety, value and comfortable atmosphere
Waitstaff is knowledgeable and informative, and very easy on the eyes while describing the many special dishes offered daily
Fab horseradish crusted tuna, and we loved the sliced tuna in pesto
Tender white asparagus served with a poached egg!! Unusual and delicious! The desserts were light and lovely--obviously made with the very finest quality ingredients
Go for the well-prepared food, and you'll go back for the value--prices are very easy-on-the wallet
Very good Italian fare served at exceptional prices
Decor is relaxed and tasteful with outside seating
Very reasonably priced drinks and wine list plus tap pints
Authentic, fresh pastas
Great fish
At least 10 daily specials
I don't know of another space on the LES serving this high quality food at these prices
I'm sure this newcomer will be very successful
The food is fantastic especially the mac and cheese with truffles and tricolore salad
The atmosphere is very professional and inviting, although a bit stuffy for the neighborhood
Music is a bit dated and inappropriate the ambiance
Service was outstanding, especially the cute blond bartender
Be sure to try one of her apple martinis - out of this world
The weekend brunch is excellent and well priced
For $10 you get a drink (the bloody marys and mimosas are excellent), soup/salad and a main dish
The desserts are great too!  Plus, there are about 6-10 tables on the ground floor that face the sidewalk
On a nice day, they open the floor to ceiling windows and it's just like eating outside
I searched all over the web for a bakery that would make an Angel Food cake for my father in-laws 70th birthday (it's his favorite)
Tompkins was the only one that said they could make one
I've never been to the bakery nor had I heard of it
I was desperate and needed an Angel Food cake
I ordered it sight unseen and had them deliver it to the restaurant where the party was
The cake was DEeeelish! It was a classic traditional Angel Food Cake
Thank you Tompkins Square Bakery! I can't wait to try the rest of your line
Keep up the delicious work
I am a regular customer of pastries, and now a regular customer of cakes! I look forward to occasions simply so I can order one of Matt's fabulous cakes! Matt is super friendly, flexible and very very talented
This bakery is simply the best!!!
After reading the glowing reviews and viewing the beautiful examples both in shop and onlie, we had the highest hopes for our anniversary corporate cake
However, what turned up-- with the exception of structure-- was nothing like we'd envisioned
The writing was amateurish and misspelled and the frosting piping was sloppy, non- concentric and looked to have been done at the last minute
My 10 year old could have done the same with Dec-A-Cake icing
Quite honestly, it looked like it had fallen apart in the van on the way over to us and had been hastily patched up
Lastly, one of the layers was stale to the point of crusty - could barely get a knife through it
It's a real shame as Matt seemed like a very nice and flexible person to deal with
Unfortunately this cake won't soon be going on their advertising hall of fame
I ordered a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting for a party of 20 or so ppl
I ordered it thru Matt, very nice guy and they even delivered it next door to the bar we were having the b-day party at before they closed! My, when it was time to cut the cake, boy, did we cut the cake! It was my ultimate out of this world carrot cake with cream cheese frosting
It was a total hit with everyone! It was just delicious! I'm glad I changed my order from a regular yellow cake with icing to this wonderful carrot cake! You've gotta try the cakes and other pastries here at Tompkins Square Bakery
out of this word!!! Yummmmy
thanks Matt!
I popped in late in the afternoon after picking up my son from school and order a cake for 8:00 the next morning
I have always enjoyed the coffee while waiting for the M-8 and love the smells wafting out of the door but I was pleasantly surprised by the cake
Simple, moist, delicious
It was for a group that groaned with muffled-mouthful delight
Highly recommended for the cake
I will be testing other treats of the TSB!
Cute new edition to this block of the E
Vil
The croissants are some of the best I've had and the scones are always a different flavor and always good
Great value on coffee and chocolate cookies too
Highly recommended
finally a delicious, convenient and reliable place to get a fast breakfast before work
but this bakery is more than just cookies and pastries
the scones are flaky and fruitfilled (so not overly sweet) and in the summer they make a killer lemonade
Really good croissants and the chocolate cookies are great, as well as the peanut butter cookies
Also, best coffee around
Never been here early, but it's a great place to go for a late night drink
good people, good staff, good fun
This place is so much fun
The food is cheap and cheerfull the atmoshere comfortable and cozy the booze flows and the service rocks, from the great waitstaff to the awesome bartenders, english irish texan brazilian this place has em' all
Good selection of beer, not too shabby wine list and boy oh boy are the special buffalo burgers good
Soups are tremendous made by the chef with a constant smile
i just love this place
The staff at South's is the best! Always friendly and welcoming and they give great service
It is always fun to go to South's!
The Scene Downtown Atlantic takes pride in being part of the "other" downtown--downtown Brooklyn
Black-and-white photos of the area from a bygone era warm the rather suburban decor
Neighborhood folks looking for a safe, leisurely lunch or dinner spread throughout the wood-heavy dining room
Leisurely service encourages lingering
The Food Solid American favorites are served with upscale presentation, and few dishes deviate from the expected

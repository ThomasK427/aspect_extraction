and I'm Indian
Initially I was not excited to go out for indian food when my husband told me about the reservations, but I was so surprised
The food was absolutely amazing! From the pakoras to the kulfi
We had a seafood platter ($32) and lobster masala ($25)
I had no idea it could be so good
The booths are a nice private touch and the staff is very friendly
Not exactly an authentic Indian atmosphere
more like a very nice restaurant that serves excellently spiced food
I cannot wait to go again
The entrees are pricey, but dessert and apps are regular - all well worth the experience
We couldn't stop raving
or eating!
I am not a big fan of Indian food but I would say this place is my favorite Indian restaurant
The food has just the right amount of spice for someone like me (who does not like spicey foods)
You get three courses for $20 at lunch and the amount of food is more than enough for anyone to leave feeling fully satisfied
The meal also includes some pita bread and a sort of spinach/chic pea dip that was very very yummy! My friend had the Tamarind Margarita, which he raved about
I passed on the alcohol at a midweek lunch
The booths are great and give a good view of the rest of the restaurant
The waiters don't pay much attention to you but we had the manager/owner come over and talk to us for a few minutes
He created an extremely friendly atmosphere
We loved the tea room where they serve hot flavored teas with a variety of scrumptious classic Indian cookies
It's a lovely little joint for some good food, fast and just kick your feet up and relax a little
I had dinner with two other friends one night
granted we didn't have the reservations, but common sense for any restaurant manager is, if you can't provide good service, then don't seat the person
taramind, though, only cares for the bottom line and treats customers poorly
they ended seating the 3 of us at a 2 person table
the waiter was snotty and didn't bother to tell us what the specials of the day were
i guess he assumed we weren't worth it
the food was fine, terribly overpriced though
I try to avoid Indian food because I have quite a variety of serious food allergies and alot of the items on the menu could kill me
When I got talked into dining here one night last month, I knew I had to be on guard
I communicated my excessively long allergy list to the staff and they carefully and respectfully navigated me through the menu and on towards a satisfying dining experience
The food was great and the portions were enormous
The prices were quite high but I dont eat indian frequently so I cant really compare it to other indian places
Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised and I'm still alive! Thanks, Tamarind
I really enjoyed my first experience at an Indian restaurant
The food was great, the waiter helpful
I went at 6:00 pm last sunday and the place was empty when arrived, but was packed by the time we left for our movie at 8:00pm
Can't wait to go again
There is a reason why there are no Indians in the restaurant: the food is terrible
Went once 2 months ago and swore never to return
Went last week with a friend and had a TERRIBLE time
Waitor was not accomodating and (ESPECIALLY relative to other Indian restaurants) and the prices are ridiculously high for terrible food
It took the staff 10 minutes to clear my plate from in front of me, despite my having seen at least two managers eye it
Save the $$ and go to to curry hill (just 2-3 blocks away) or spend the $$ at a midtown indian eatery  (Also: I commented to hostess prior to seating that there were a lot of tables empty when choosing my seat, and she snapped back that they had a lot of reservations coming in at one time
I assure yout hat was not the case)
I'm not going to trash the place simply because I had a bad experience there, but here's the facts: the food is very good, the portions are small-to-medium, and the prices are large
This is not a place to go for value, or even for real Indian food, for that matter
The interior is very nice
The service was snobby
We were told (after being seated) that everybody had to order at least $25 worth of food/drink per person
After arguing about this and requesting tap water instead of a bottled variety, we were exiled to customer Siberia, and the staff seemed eager get us out of the restaurant as soon as possible
The food *was* pretty good, though, (though certainly not worth the prices) so it's worth checking out if you have an expense account to work with
We have been twice to Tamarind
The first time with a large group which was in the Tea Room next to the restaurant which was fine as we had the place to ourselves and the second time in the restaurant
The food and drinks are second to none and the portions are huge so I recommend ordering a salad and a shared meal
I do recommend making reservations as this place gets crowded
My date took me here for our first date
It was such a great experience
The food is made to cater to your tastebuds, service is amazing, and drinks are delicious!!
This place is amazing --- good enough to inspire me to sign up for Citysearch! The food is delectably fantastic, the service is top notch, and the ambience is perfect
Great for brunch, try the tea for two - a great value
Some of the best Indian in town!
This is probably one of the most expensive Indian restaurants in the city (for dinner, at least), but it's also the best one I've been to
The chicken tikka masala (I couldn't resist) was creamy and sweet, yet complex, and the lamb pasanda (while a bit dry-- the editor was right to recommend you order it pink) was delicious and unusual
The hostess was a bit aloof, tried to seat us in the front wind tunnel-like foyer/bar/dining room, and did not wish us well at the end of the night, but the waiter anticipated our every need with great expertise
He wasn't especially warm, either, but the nan certainly was
hence the reason I will absolutely go back again
I made a reservation using Opentable a few weeks in advance and noted on the reservation that it was a birthday dinner for my wife
I didn't mention the birthday again but the restaurant still remembered to put a candle on my wife's dessert
Dinner was excellent
The venison chops were tasty without being too gamey, the mixed grill offered a nice variety of flavors, and two different chicken dishes were both moist and tender
Ser
Tamarind is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in all of NYC
I have dined at countless Indian restaurants throughout New York and the country, but no other place compares to Tamarind
Originally my friend who is Indian had raved about this place so much that I had to check it out
Boy was she right - everything on the menu is delicious! Their heavenly cuisine from the palak panir, to the shrimp dishes, to the lamb with apricot, just melts in your mouth
Not to mention how lovely the minimal white decor is and how fabulous the service is
It's a true gem!
As an Indian, studying in the U
S
, I was genuinely thrilled to discover Tamarind
I honestly believe that this is the best Indian restaurant , not only in NYC, but anywhere
The wide range of the menu is a pleasant change from most stereotypical Indian restaurants in NYC, which all reproduce the same overused dishes
At Tamarind you find the usual favorites, but the chef also introduces diners to an entirely different side of Indian cooking
The quality of the food is truly excellent
The atmosphere and decor are also outstanding
The service, while not brilliant, is certainly satisfactory
I have been about 5 or 6 times and have had a great experience each time
Highly recommended!
I was questioned by the host if I really had made my reservation
Made to wait 20 minutes even as the restaurant really was not all that busy
Food came cold and tasting like the best/worst I had eatenin curry row on 6th Street
Smarmy owners/managers tried to charm us without much sincerity
They wanted to simply stop us from complaining
a true fall from grace
this place has clearly lost its chef, its inspiration, its quality and taste
do not pay these prices for this food
you have been warned by me--a new york restaurant afficionado, an indian-american, a former fan and now nauseated client of tamarind
One of the finest Indian cuisine with friendly and efficient service, and authentic Indian food

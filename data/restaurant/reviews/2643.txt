Bravo Great job!! Next time I have an occasion to drink at 7am this is where I'm going
In Short Founded in 1964 in Hoboken, New Jersey, this sandwich joint has grown into a nationwide restaurant chain
The generously sized subs are modeled on the balloon-like shape of a blimp, which also inspired this chain's name
Famed for its Italian bread and sliced meats, the restaurant offers signature sandwiches, including the Durango Roast Beef, the Baja Turkey and Cheese and the Tuscan Ham and Swiss
Look for grilled panini, wraps, soups and a special kid-sized sub
wow, you're not kidding
the sandwiches here are great
A lot of sandwich for the money
I eat here at least 4 days a week
menu has enough variety to try something new each day! A healthy alternative! Much better than any other sandwich offered
Better than Subway! and not expensive like Quiznos! THIS IS THE PLACE! ENJOY!
Their new grilled sandwiches are so delicious! For the price, they offer so much
Get your lunch and watch a concert down in the park! Much better than Subway
Way more meat and better flavor! You have to try this place!
My boyfriend and I ate here so we could eat outside while watch the band play in the seaport
It is a perfect seat for the show and it was worth the 30 minute wait
We were told the wait would be 20 minutes but, of course, the hostess never wrote down our names and so the second hostess was very confused when we inquired about our table 15 minutes later
We didn't wait much longer and took advantage of the very limited happy hour they had at the bar inside
The food is typical chain-like restaurant food
The pizza is buttery and heavy in your stomach and the nachos could have been done much much better
Don't expect much and understand that this place is for tourists!
Going to Pizzeria Uno was the biggest mistake I have ever made
It was the worst service or should I say lack of, that I have ever experienced
My waiter was practically on vacation while I was there
The worst thing about it was that I took someone there for their birthday expecting to have a good time and instead the night was ruined
The management was hounding my table all night and my food was not handled in a respectable manner
When asked to rap up my dessert, my waiter returned with what looked like a mixture that somewhat resembled my dessert
To sum it up with one word, the night was absolutely horrific
This branch is extremely popular with the tourists, but it does have a nice decor, and a kick-ass view of the river
The food is ok, typical for the chain, a good place to stop for a lunch
In Short Since first opening in 1955 in Des Plaines, Ill
, McDonald's has become one of the most recognized brands in the world
Casual and kid-friendly, the red-and-gold colored restaurants offer quick drive-thru or dine-in service with a menu of burgers, sandwiches and more
All-time favorites include the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets, Filet-O-Fish sandwich and McDonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available
Offerings like hot cakes and the Egg McMuffin sandwich are available for breakfast
If you've been to this McDonald's by Wall St
u'd know this is far from your typical McDonald's
Designed to attract the countless brokers scouring for food during packed lunch hours, this McDonalds is beautiful with an elegant glass and marble design to all the tables and seats nearly 200 people
While they are no longer around it also used to house a classic pianist and a nice gift shop filled with all the little oddities McDonald's has ever produced over the years
Even without theses extravangces this McDonald's offers a service and feel like no other and is much a NY landmark as any other
Went there with collegues for lunch since there were queues in other nearby restaurants
Should have been an indication but hey, we were hungry
Waited 8 minutes for them to set up the table, another 10 to take our orders and 1 hr plus later for the waitress to say the food is coming in 2 minutes
10 minutes later and no food, we tell them we are leaving
No apologies offered whatsover and they even dared charge us for the drinks
No way we are returning to the place
Blech
This place was positively horrible
A lot of people talk about the restaurant's view, which is okay, but the horrible food and service don't even come close to making up for it
Plus the river is tad smelly, so sitting outside isn't necessarily all that pleasant
Avoid at all costs
A complete and total waste of money
The only thing this restaurtant has going for it is the views, which are excellent
The food was so over priced and bad, that I was inspired to write my first ever review of a restaurant to forewarn others
Buy a drink and enjoy the views, then go elsewhere to eat
That's the only way you'll get any value for your money
The Downtown for Dinner prix-fixe menu had merely two options for each course, appetizer, main, and desert
Nonetheless, one of the options, the striped bass, was not available; instead catfish was served
One dining companion, a vegetarian, was told that no concessions for her kind would be made for the prix-fixe menu
Our entrees and appetizers were brought without us asking; everything else, bread, coffee, water, the check, we had to beg for from our rarely available waiter
The food was the minimum of quality you would demand from a four star restaurant
The coffee was scorched and the mashed potatoes tasted instant
In summing up, the service was some of the worst I've ever received, the food was merely passable, and the atmosphere was bordering on institutional
Harbor Lights is a sorry excuse for a restaurant; Seaport patrons would fare better dining in the food court just next door
Went for lunch since it's near my office and don't be fooled b/c it's located inside a mall
The view is amazing the service impeccable
The food was pretty good tho obviously overshadowed by the view of the bridge
Highly recommended for a sunny day
This is the worst experience I've ever had with a restaurant
AFter going to the hassle of making reservations 24 hours in advance, getting up early in the morning taking the very long drive into Manhattan to eat at Harbour Lights, we were rebuffed immediately
No one phoned us to tell us there was a private party (24 hours in advance no ONE KNEW THIS!!!!!!) I would fire the entire service staff especially the MANAGER!!! This is a HIGH ZERO place in my book I would never receommend this place to anyone
Neither the food nor the service equalled the fantastic view of the water and the Brooklyn Bridge
The portions were large but the flavors were not interesting or particularly tasty
The dessert was very uninspiring (especially if you are a chocolate lover)
Go only if you are not too interested in the cuisine
My husband and I dined here with two of our friends this past weekend, and we all agreed it is a unique restaurant, that you just got to experience for yourself
Everything was perfect, from the host, to the waiters, who were attentive and courteous, and most importantly the food was amazing, and elegantly presented, they had a great seafood selection as well as steaks
The wine list was extensive, we had a California wine, Opus 1, which is my husbands favorite, and also, they had some fine wines by the glass
The view is just spectacular with its constant changing scenery and overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge
We are looking forward to going back, we found a very special place
Went here for the Downtown for Dinner promo
We were 15 minutes late for our reservation but still seated promptly
The food from the pre-set menu was good but not stellar
I would definately come back on a nice nice to try the regular menu
Friendly waitstaff
My best friend and I went to dinner on Friday, November 8, 2002 and we both enjoyed our meals
We arrived half an hour late for our 8:00 reservation but we were accomodated within 5-10 minutes on a busy Friday night
The staff was very attentive and helpful
I had pasta with sauteed chicken and roasted vegetables, while my friend had strip steak with sauteed spinach and whipped potatoes
My pasta came in a light tomato broth-like sauce and it was mouth watering
My friend's steak was tender and juicy
The portions weren't bite size either
We both left with full stomaches and a bit of food left in our plates
And by the way, the view is wonderful
Definitely go at night
The Scene With its yellow slat walls, nautical art and well-worn oak bar, this onetime fishermen's lair is now a snug little neighbor to both South Street Seaport and the glass sequoias of nearby Wall Street
The creaky restaurant dates from 1790 and lies just under the massive shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge
The Food Not surprisingly, seafood is a strong point
Start with fresh mussels in a peppery tomato broth or the crisp and buttery soft-shell crabs, which are a house specialty
The lean-but-flavorful buffalo steak and burgers also put on a good showing

I came here for the all you can eat special
The good thing about this all you can eat place is that they don't pack lots of rice with the fish
However, I don't think the quality of fish is that good or fresh, but hey you get what you pay for-$19
95 for all you can eat
I mean the fish is better than grocery store sushi
Also, the rice sometimes is wet and very vinegarly and will fall apart
Sometimes, service is fast and sometimes it is not
Harumi has a lot of take out business and those orders seem to have precedence
Overall, if you are willing to forgo quality of fish for an inexpensive, but plentiful eating experience, harumi is the place for you
I go there almost once a week for more than a year now and all I can say is that they are the best
The staff is really friendly, the sushi is great and with their special menu you'll definetly be satisfied
Try it!
Harumi Sushi has the freshest and most delicious array of sushi in NYC
I highly recommend it for not just its superb cuisine, but also for its friendly owners and staff
My boyfriend and I had dinner at Henry's this past Saturday night and it was nice
They have an outdoor patio and a roomy indoor dining area as well (they can definitely accommodate large groups)
The food menu was a bit small, but had a nice variety, with some French- and Italian-influenced dishes, with the usual steak and burger
No entree really struck my fancy so I combined two sides: a grilled chicken breast and the macaroni and cheese
Both were great
My boyfriend ordered the Penne and he enjoyed his meal as well
For dessert we split the combination platter, which had rather small portions but they were good
The service was very attentive, as our water glasses were never empty
Also, the ambience is comfortable and somewhat romantic (but it's a place you can take families and children too)
Overall I enjoyed Henry's very much
This is a good place to hand in the neighborhood
The people are nice, they don't rush you and the food is good
It's one of our favorite places to go for lunch (salads and sandwiches) and for drinks and desserts or for dinner with the in-laws
The calamari, brulee and goat cheese salads are our favorites
I've only been to Henry's once and it was a very pleasant experience
The decor is wonderful; wood paneling and soothing lighting
very relaxing and charming
No waiting
The price range is wide-there are some expensive things and some more reasonable things on the menu
Had the chicken kebob w/ couscous for an appetizer and it was wonderful! Wish they had that as an extree! The chicken club sandwich was out of this world as well
Ordered a small side of fries (only $2) and they are among the best I've ever had
The waitress was fantastic, came back to check on things without hovering around
Tables were cleaned between courses
The only negative was the lemon tart my friend ordered; I tried it out and it was way too tart for me
I'll be back- I'm hoping the results are just as good!
Really nice place for a date
The wood decor the candles burning give it an intimate feel
There's a bar in front to just have a few drinks
The food presentation is fabulous
Great bread olive oil for dipping ! Everything arrived perfect (cooked correctly, this that excluded or on the side) Our waiter was nice attentive
I thought the menu was pretty limited but you can find something to eat (ex
chicken, a steak, a burger, a pasta, a salad) but just not enough choices of each for such a nice place
They have a good wine list - offering half bottles, full bottles or by the glass
It's definitely a nice evening out
Our bill was $70 (before tip) - we had a bottle of wine, I had a burger fries while my friend ordered a salad w/grilled shrimp
Henry's is just what the doctor ordered for the upper-UWS
This neighborhood gem has a great, warm, wood-paneled ambience, and the food is consistently good
The wine list is not too shabby, and the outdoor eating area is fantastic in the warmer months
The bar is inviting and the bartenders are always very friendly
The only criticisms I have is that the service is pretty spotty
We've had great servers there, and then we've had incredibly bad servers there
Doesn't make sense
The other is that they, for some odd reason, have bread, but no bread plates
You eat it on the table!  I also disagree with the reviewer who said the penne w/ sausage is bad - it is very good
We dine at Henry's an average of two times a month
Sometimes it's just our family
Other times we arrange to meet friends there
The menu truely has something for everyone, and we're always pleased with the quality
The atmosphere is warm without feeling clautrophic
Love the decor -- wonderful French posters on the walls and attractive lighting
Service at Henry's is friendly and always great - a rarity in NYC
To start: the soups are always tasty and innovative
For lunch: the tuna burger is AMAZING!!, the hamburgers are big and juicy and i swear the the french fries best in the City! Yummy house salad, perfectly (lightly) dressed
For dinner: I always go for the fish and it's always cooked just right
At Henry's the mgmt, the chef the staff are all exceedingly professional and it shows
While you're there, study the ultra-original poster Series, it's entertainment for the whole family
And people - can we PLEASE take a moment to appreciate the fantastically gorgeous Arts Crafts style woodworking in this establishment??!! If you haven't been in awhile, GO TO HENRY's, they rock
(ahem
the managers are all yummy too)
First, they really know how to make a Manhattan
My starter earned Henrys another gold star five crisp, piping-hot fried oysters on little beds of mustardy celery root salad all nestled in their shells, accompanied by two toothsome sauces, one creamy garlic and ancho chile, the other an obviously homemade cocktail sauce with just the right horseradish bite
In a carnivorous mood, I ordered the New York strip steak, rare
Happily it came rare, napped in a rich jus
Excellent accompaniments were lightly creamed spinach with a hint of allspice and generous pile of perfect crispy fries
(I asked for, and happily received, another dish of the garlic ancho chile sauce for dipping!) While I generally eschew dessert I couldnt resist their perfect apple tart - a crisp, buttery crust, apples cooked just right, topped with fresh vanilla bean ice cream and a drizzle of heavenly almond cream
The first time we went here it was very nice, the steak was cooked right and pretty flavorful and the service was very nice
The second time the service was horrendous -- the food took forever to arrive, he never came back to ask how it was or offered us more drinks
The burger was AWFUL -- it had barely touched a grill
I took two bites and pushed it away, but it still made me sick the whole evening and the next day
If the waiter had come back, I could have complained, but he never did -- he's lucky I wasn't the one paying
The positive first experience cannot override the second at all
I can't recommend
Don't know what everyone's talking about - the place is great! The hostesses are sweet, the waiters are good and the food is excellent - the gazpacho is just right, the steak sandwich is my best friend's favorite and the chocolate cake is to die for! A great place to sit outside, smoke a cigarette, be perfectly content
This place is great
Totally needed in the neighborhood - it's a wonderful place to sit outside and have Sunday brunch or grab a burger for dinner
The room is large and spacious, and the service is attentive
Definitely give it a try!
In Short Burnished brass and stained wood complement roughly mortared brick and the occasional plant
Amid ubiquitous earth tones, corporate types and small parties (celebrating or simply living large) occupy deep booths done up in fine upholstery and lit from above by pin spotlights
Burgers, prime rib and steaks are the specialties of the house, but the menu also includes salmon, salads, pork chops and roasted chicken
Houston's is one of those places you always know you can count on for attentive service and a solid meal without the attitude of bigger names in the business
The menu is always consistent and sevice always pofessional
I wish there was a Houston's in my city, then I wouldn't have to travel to NYC, Boston Phoenix to enjoy the experience
Ok
So my co-workers and I decided to have lunch at Houston's today
To our surprise, the experience wasn't as pleasant as it usually is

not located on the best of blocks and unpleasantly decorated
but the food makes up for it
and the waiters were attentive
BUT nothing will make up for the fact that they have a huge customer service problem
they miscalculated our bill and told us we had put less cash than what was needed
my guests and i knew that was a mistake but the manager of the restaurant did not believe it
we felt mistreated as if we were thieves
we will never go back to that restaurant again
whatever happened to the customer is always right? and anyway, they had no sufficient desserts
This is the place if you want Authentic Persian Cuisine
A large assortment of free appetizers that are delicious
Order the Colbeh for two if you want an assortment of the delicetable meats
They have the best grilled, juicy chicken on the bone
What a great feast
Although the place isn't the fanciest place to look at in NYC, the food more than makes up for it
They have 3 restaraunts in total: one in Great Neck Long Island,one on Main St
in Queens, and the NYC location
The city is the second best behing the great neck branch, and the steak kabob (called BARG) is to die for
Combinations are a must for 2 or three people to share
Definitely hit this place up for a carnivorrous meal
(Steak Chicken or Ground Beef)
The president of our company is Turkish and she praises Sahara Grill as the best Turkish food anywhere
The place doesn't look like much but the food speaks all
Hummus is so creamy and tasty that you'll have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner
I just wish they were near my home so I can have it on weekends
I've eaten at many kosher restaurants in New York and I'm sorry to say that Ben's is NOT on the top of my list
Their deli sandwiches need some work
Often times the meat is quiet dry and unflavorful
Their matzo balls are huge, but they don't have much flavor
The past few times I've been there, it's been almost empty, which I guess is a plus for those looking for an uncrowded kosher restaurant
I've eaten at Ben's many times including the rehearsal dinner for our wedding
Most of the time the service has been good to great but there have been a few occasions Bens has disappointed
The food has always been good but not great(2nd Ave is better)
This place is worth it for NYC deli
Huge portions, delicious food, beautiful place
Bowls of pickles, rye bread, and the best coleslaw on the table
followed by mountains of wonderful, inexpensive food
The kosher deli I would most recommend!
Atmosphere was mediocre; food was bland and tasteless
In a city like New York, there are many other places to get better Italian food
I think a box of pasta and jar of Ragu would have tasted better than what they served
Waitresses were pleasant and had strong German accents
Perhaps they would have been better at cooking schnitzel than Italian
I think the cook was allergic to garlic as it was lacking in all dishes
Believe me, if you think this is good Italian food, you havent lived
Morover, the the bhindi was still raw and the waitress didnt know the difference between wheat roti/ chappati and Nan
Not for an Indian resturant
The Chicken House is down the block from my office, and when I want deep-fried food in a hurry, this is where I go
The menu is limited: chicken, rice beans, frozen fish (shrimp, whiting, crab sticks), and french fries, but one receives EXCELLENT value for the money and it is SO WORTH walking down the block for
The restaurant is very small (about 1/2 dozen seats at a counter), has a serving window (for walk-ups), and the lines are sometimes out the door
The oil is changed frequently, and the food never tastes TOO HEAVY
The standard canned soft drinks are offered, as well as bottled Snapple drinks
The Chicken House is what it is, non-pretentious, large portions, served in an on-the-go atmosphere
One will definitely be pleased with the prices, and be even happier with the portion and quality of the food
My girlfriend and I were seated and were waiting 20 minutes at our table for our waiter to give us a menu or ask us if we needed anything
He had given us bread and water, so he clearly knew we were there and under his service
No such luck
Finally, we decided to walk out
As we were leaving the owner asked what was going on
We said that we had been waiting for 20 minutes and no one had come to our table to even give us a menu
He gave us a dismissive, far from genuine apology
Here's a tip to the owner
usually you should offer a disgruntled customer something free so that they stay, as well as a genuine apology
Instead, he could care less
This is interesting considering the place was not exactly bustling
DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! This is the worst service I have ever had in New York City
Very good, standard Italian fare
I had a very good linguine with white clam sauce
My sister was very happy with her angel hair pasta with roasted tomatos and garlic
The service is excellent - friendly and attentive
The atmosphere is very spacious for New York; you won't be sitting in your neighbor's lap
The prices are not exactly cheap, but they are reasonable
The menu could use some innovation
Overall, it's not worth traveling for, but if you are in the neighborhood it's a great standby
Always the same bartender - forget his name but he's very personable
Food is outrageously good and very under priced
Portions are generous
This lights could be dimmed a bit, though
I always dine at Murano
The overall experience is excellent
They owner's son has a bald head and he is so SEXY
The prices are cheap compared to the quality, taste and service received there
Excellent Food!!! Excellent Service!!! Excellent Prices!!!!!!! ***** Mention that Bobby from JCO sent you and get the royal treatment!!!
The food here is cheap and really good
You can tell it's authentic because the menu is written in Urdu! $7
99 buys a delux combo
Cafeteria style, and a bit run down
The staff and other clientelle seems a bit wary of outsiders
But you'll enjoy the food and the prices
--Eat Club is an NYC roving group of gluttons
You know you've struck gold when you're eating at a place where all the taxi drivers are hanging out
This is a strange establishment: restaruant, travel agency, money transferrer, and tape and video rental store all rolled into one
It's an incredibly shabby little establishment but for what it lacks in decor, it makes up for with good food and incredibly low prices
For $5 you get a plate HEAPED with rice and two entrees of your choice
The portions are HUGE and I always share with someone
This may not be the best Pakistani food in town but it is very good and its location sets it apart from the rest
If nothing else, its a hilarious expereince
Maybe this is what Seinfeld was trying to get Babbu to set up :-)
I was introduced to Giggles by a couple of my co workers, i had reservations about going, but one thursday nite a few of my co workers convinced me to go
IT WAS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!

In Short This tiny Nolita Thai joint is a favorite neighborhood hangout with its vintage decor of dainty flowered wallpaper and cozy red booths
The quick kitchen turns out fiery favorites--chicken satay with chunky peanut sauce, pad thai and steamed dumplings--and innovative desserts, like the sweet and savory banana roll
Best of all, nothing on the menu costs more than $10
Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible
The girl who waited on us (and mind you we were a table of ah, downtown fashion/magazine people) seemed to be more concerned with who was walking in the front door and gossiping w/her co-workers than paying attention to our order
Drinks got screwed up, she acted put upon
Guess the 555Soul ads didn't launch her big modeling career
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though
Ok, so it's kinda cool looking
the musics's pretty good
and I'll even go as far as saying the food LOOKS good
Really though, where's the seasoning? This food is asian-air fusion
Makes you crave MSG
no kidding!  The drinks are a saving grace, but service staff, please, get over yourselves
Don't look down your nose at me like that
I'm helping pay for your job, and remember, you work as service staff in a restaurant - you know
people out for a NICE time, etc
I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste
mediocre wanna-retro place
they definitely need a change in attitude or some cold shower- grungy grungy ok but nothing much
Happened upon Lovely Day in situation when birthday party for 8 had not reserved elsewhere
They were most accommodating
They do take reservations for groups
Well prepared food
Funky decor inviting, fun atmosphere, a refreshing break away type place
Only negative was poor air conditioning on warm day
The group had such a good time it was not a real issue
Inexpensive and good
I have been twice to this restaurant
I love it
I plan on stopping by next week as well
I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up
I recieved prompt service with a smile
To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting
Definately check it out!!!
this is still one of my most favorite restaurants in the area the food is inexpensive but very good (kimono shrimp special was excellent) and has a great atmosphere
Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size
This place is a classic instance of an overrated, third rate new restaurant
The food was completely mediocre, even though the prices were on the lower side
With a few drinks, the tab can quickly add up
The service was among the worst I have ever experienced in New York - the waitstaff was too busy laughing with each other to pay any attention to the customers
A dirty dish was returned cleaned with a dirty rag and no apology
What can be better than a good yet cheap noodle dish, candle light and a cozy vibe? If you have a date, this place is tops for first timers
Dishes are of median portion so you don't feel like a stuffed bird and it's reasonable enough to foot the bill
At prices under $10, it was a good enough meal
My date and I enjoyed the pan seared tuna appetizer
(small but good) The chow fun with shrimp had a sweet savory taste
Drinks like soda come in munchkin land size
As people started coming in, they were in pairs for some reason
Guess, it was a date night
And there was one waitress, so be warned on other busy nights for service
Otherwise, it was just lovely
I was very pleased with Lovely Day
It does not try to be something its' not
The food was great and it was the perfect place to go after shopping with hordes of people on Broadway
The service was slow but so what, just don't go there if you are in a rush
Nice find
The Scene Diners flock here for Italian comfort food, shabby-chic decor and a mellow East Village crowd
The double-sided, two-storied space begins with a bar-wrapped open kitchen and proceeds from one cozy, candlelit nook to the next
A brick-walled back room with farmhouse tables seats large parties, while subterranean pillow-strewn banquettes appeal to romantics
Unfortunately, stiff hosts and indifferent servers can crush the feel-good vibe
The Food Chef-owner Frank Prisinazo's fresh, rustic fare satisfies the soul and the wallet
Start with addictive chicken liver or cheesy stracchino crostini on chewy Sullivan Street bread
Homemade pastas with meaty bolognese or wild-mushroom ragu are simple pleasures, but weekly rotating too-soft risottos, such as sweet pear-Gorgonzola, are hit-or-miss
Favorites include moist, herb-stuffed whole fish and oven-roasted pork loin with crispy potatoes and mixed greens
Skip the pedestrian cheese plate and end the evening with chocolate-doused hazelnut panna cotta instead
hostess was the best part of the evening, downhill from there
waitress would only take a complete order (app, main and dessert!) at same time
reason - sooo busy! ha! the place had 4 empty tables that i could see (7pm - sunday) i've run a similarly priced place in san fran in the past and the food wasnt to our reasonable standards, staff couldnt get past initial interview
to top it off - paid $103 bill with a hundred and a fifty
waitress did not return with change until we insisted! awful and expects $47 tip!
When we were about to sit at a table by the bar, the host said don't bother
A disabled patron was about to sit on a bar stool and the host said
that's reserved
The host checked a patron into the edge of a table by the bar
Need I say more
No reservations possible for parties less than 10 means no idea when you will be seated
We waited OVER two hours from the time we arrive until our food was served
And all this for average Italian food served in uncomfortable booths
Go elsewhere and save your date!
Supper is a lovely place: good ambiance, cute communal tables and delicious inexpensive food
The service, unfortunately, was a bit obnoxious: my date and I were interrupted too many times by the waitress (who was probably just trying to be attentive, but there is something as a little too much attention) and later the bus boy, who kept on trying to take away our plates, even though we were still eating
But the truly unforgivable thing about this place is the red wine: it's served COLD
When I pointed this out to the waitress, she said: Yes, that's the way we do it here
She said the wine lasted longer that way, which I found to be a pretty bad reason
Only at the end of our meal, when the wine in my glass had warmed up to room temperature, did I discover that it was actually pretty good
Want some snotty attitude with that pasta? Well, that's what you'll get at Supper
I went there with my girlfriend for her birthday with about ten people and a reservation
The host spoke to us like we should be licking his shoes just so we can give him our hard earned money and eat in his 'coooool' joint
The food was good, but I don't care how popular a place is, I don't want to be made to feel like a fool or that I'm not special enough to be there
There are plenty of great Italian restaurants to go to in this town
I've been going to this place off and on since it opened, and its been refreshingly consistent
If I'm up for a hearty meal that'll make me all warm and cozy afterward, its the first place i think about
the beet salad and the bread salad app (can't ever remember the name of the bread salad) are always great

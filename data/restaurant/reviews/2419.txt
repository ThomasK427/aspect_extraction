TOTALLY and completely over priced
Absolutely no atmosphere cramped dining room
Would never recommend this place to anyone
There are so many wonderful restaurants in New York this is one of the worse
Save your $110 per person for something else
IF you want a special place like none-other
this is it
Perfect service, attention to detail and the best in food arts
style and perfection says it all!
Glory be, finally a bartender who knew how to serve Pernod
Dinner was lovely, too
I dined at Jean George in the winter of 2002 and was quite impressed with the food
It was stunningly presented and clever in it's use of texture and ingredients, but I did find the service a bit over-fussy and the sommelier did not do a very good job of matching a wine to our specifications
But overall, a wonderful dining experience
I went here for a friend's birthday earlier this year and had an awesome time! The food was superb
I couldn't believe the large portion sizes compared to the inexpensive prices
I would definitely go back there again
Too bad I don't live close enough to the restaurant to order take-out
I have been coming here for years
I have attempted to find a better Pork Fried Rice place in NYC
And failed, this place is top notch and inexpensive!!!  Food is outstanding, I will keep coming back
I love this place
Especially the breakfast wraps, thay're soooo good
I moved from around the block to the east side, and this is one of the things I miss most about the west side
The wait for delivery is a bit long
But the wraps are fresh and so yummy!
During a non-eventful Saturday lunch hour, an order placed online did not get through because the joint's fax machine was broken
It would have been nice to find that out on the website but it took us an hour of waiting for Godot before calling and being told the news that no lunch was prepared for us
When the order finally went through by phone it took another hour and 10 minutes for the food to get to us - we're talking a 4-block distance
And even though by the time lunch came even hunger and any desire to be critical had disappeared, the Under the Tuscan Sun salad was hands down miserable
Tried this place last night, at about 7 p
m
The staff watched as we decided on our order -- then, when we tried to place it, told us they were OUT OF WRAPS! How does a place called It's a Wrap run out of wraps on a Saturday evening? With three hours of operation left for the evening? And would it be too much to ask to inform customers who, more than likely, are going to order one?
The food is made quickly and the taste is not horrible and well it's cheap
However, the staff is quite annyoing sometimes-- I always feel hurried
Their wraps are not very meticulously made-- ingredients are slapped on and food is often cold
From the outside, it's pretty, but once inside you'll realize that the flourescent lighting of sorts is hard to take
It's a good place to grab a bite, not a good place to have a meal
They ask for your name when ordering, and instead of yelling out a number when your wrap is ready - you hear your first name
it's the little things! A little Italy is delicious (if a bit messy)! And they'll deliver to central park! It's a wrap is a great find!
In Short This restaurant, an offshoot of the celebrity-besieged East Hampton eatery of the same name, is enlivened by a copper-topped bar, an on-display wood-burning oven and a royal blue oceanic mural running along its walls
The menu sticks close to the Mediterranean-minded Nick
We dropped by Nick Toni's on a Monday night when another restaurant we tried to get in was busy and were relatively pleased with our meal
Staff was attentive, although the restaurant was no where near capacity
Enjoyed the Wild Boar Ragout and Warm Chocolat Cake for dessert
Like the warm pastel decor and mood lighting
Only gripe is high cost of unspectacular, yet adequate food
Proximity to Lincoln Center undoubtedly drives up the prices
After reading the reviews on this site before going to N T's, I was not expecting much
However, I was very impressed with the meal
While the service wasn't so hot and the dining room smokey from the grill, the food was excellent
Overall, it was better than I expected
big disappointment
Food good, but very limited menu pricey for what it was (brunch)
But service was marginal, perfunctory, no effort to please
Refused to substitute vegi burger for regular burger on brunch special, even though both burgers same price on regular menu ($11) - give me a break! Very skimpy when we asked for extra bread
Waitress ignored us most of the time
How do places like this stay in business? Looks pretty from the outside, beautiful cozy room, but there are lots of other pretty places in NY with good food, so I'd say don't bother!
This is one of the most overrated restaurant in NYC
Cold service, high prices, bland food
How do you prepare a pasta dish for $21 in less than 5 minutes? Since when do you use tomato heels in a 'Fried Green Tomato' appetizer
You would better served going to 'Olive Garden'
Same quality for 1/3 the price and a realistic atmosphere
Skip Nick's
I usually avoid Chinese restaurants like the plague since I grew up on fantastic stuff and most restaurants are such a bastardized version of this beautiful cuisine that it pains me to eat there
ESG defied stereotype
The food is actually really well-made (I can at least vouch for the Szechuan dishes that we ordered)
Even the sushi wasn't too bad--and it's well priced
The staff is lovely: attentive and friendly without being saccharin or overbearing
Admittedly the decor isn't so much to look at (looks better from inside than from out), but it's fine for a casual night out
Arte Cafe is wonderful
You can almost always get a table, even without a reservation
The staff are very polite and welcoming and the food is generally good (I had one bad experience last summer when they were clearly overwhelmed and understaffed)
The whole-wheat pasta is a must
i eat here ate least once a week for lunch
i've had the brunch too
all very good, reasonably priced
my favorite is the caesar salad
it's perfectly dressed and the anchovies are just right
great iced tea and brunch oj
service is hit or miss
great place to chat or read a book
The garden in the back is absolutely beautiful - makes you forget your in NYC
Our waiter was very nice and professional
My Saltimbocca unfortunately wasn't: dry and tough - not recommended
The pasta was good though
Prices are also reasonable
Awesome brunch -- they serve muffins instead of bread - cute! Great pizza and pasta -- pretty rooms/outdoor area
Love this place!
Veal does not have to be dry
It's not unusual but it shouldn't happen at all
The service here is a little bit curt,but good enough
They've done a great job renovating and the lighting and decor is relaxing and pretty
No complaints about the food at all
Their pricing for dinner was pretty average for the area, but if they have the same food on their lunch menus, I believe this would be a good value
Went to dinner before the Opera and it was wonderful
The Atmosphere is very uptown chic without being pretentious
Everyone was pleasant and our server was superb, totally there for us
The food was fantastic for the money I had an $11 pasta dish that was perfect and would have been easily $18 anywhere else
Wine list had MANY good selections under $30! Just a great experience

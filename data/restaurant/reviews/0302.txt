I had good (but overpriced at 5) pork taco, side of astounding Mexican cornbread, and lovely cafe de olla
Not bad for 20
No sure why CitySearch has this classified as Italian, because it's Mexican at its best
We stopped in one Saturday for brunch and it was such a pleasant surprise
I had their version of Huevos Rancheros and it really was one of the best things I have ever tasted
The service was friendly and attentive and the room was very cute
My only minor complaint is the traditional Mexican music
Why do they think people want to hear that? It actually detracts from an otherwise sophisticated yet warm vibe
Definitely check it out
Loved it! The margaritas were strong, made with fresh lime
No sweet sour or powder in the drinks
Just wonderful
The salsas were flavorful and spicy
crap food, the worst margarita i have ever had (choked on the fumes) inattentive service, overpriced, pretentious yuppies
what more could you ask for?
I'm perplexed by the bad reviews here and wonder if perhaps the chefs are inconsistent
I think it has the best Mexican-REAL Mexican- food I've had in New York, leagues beyond Dos Caminos (overhyped), Miracle Grill (bland and Southwestern, not Mexican) or Veracruz(bland and overpriced), all places that have similar ratings on this site
The decor is stylish with traditional elements
The margaritas were large and delicious, and the salsas and guacamole perfect
My entree-a vegetarian plate with beans, cactus paddle and potato filled taquitos-was perfectly spiced and inventive; the portions were smaller than the obscene amounts of food served elsewhere, but it was still more than I could eat in one sitting
It may be more expensive than your corner burrito joint, but you get a lot of quality and flavor for those extra dollars
The food is horrible
Bulk made and aged ceviche - you'd think they might get the hint when there's a barely touched dish at nearly every table
Chorizo is 50% oil and I wouldn't want to guess what the other 50% is
If this place was any good, it certainly isn't anymore
Plus you get to pay plenty of the privilege
We've been, several times, to the newer branch on sixth avenue
DON'T go if you want enchiladas and tacos - that's not what this place is about
It's about authentic, real MEXICAN food, not Tex-Mex, and it's some of the best we've ever had
Cactus paddles, Veracruz fish, etc
And the menu changes regularly, so you have to go back again and again
Don't understand the comments about skimpy portions
We've never been able to finish
And Matt is a great server
This is certainly not the worst restaurant that I have eaten at
But, it is certainly not the best
The drinks are acutally pretty good I can not complain about the service either
The problem is the food
My salad was made of some substance that had the texture of leather by the taste of it, I would imagine that leather would tase like this salad
The chicken had the same problem very tough small portions
Been walking by for months now and meaning to try La Palapa
The design is inviting and the atmosphere inside is casual/pleasant
Service was efficient and knowledgable
Appetizers were good
We had the quesadillas and chilupas plus two frozen margaritas
margaritas were strong and well made, but maybe a touch too sour
Entree was the duck with mole, swiss chard and rice and unfortunately verged on tasteless
the glass of house shiraz I had with it was quite good though
Strong hints of coffee bean made it a great way to finish the meal
Prices are slightly inflated
Not absurd, but high enough not to think of the space as a good value
I found myself thinking of Esperanto on Avenue C a lot while we were at La Palapa and kind of wishing I had gone there
Overall enjoyed the place but there was nothing that stood out against other similar places
Service was a little on the slow side since we had to flag down our waitress all evening just to get her attention
Bonus points for the complimentary champagne toasts for bday celebrations
We had reservations and were seated 5 minutes late (I'M NOT COMPLAINING)
The service was horrible, they didn't take our order for a half an hour
After waiting for an hour our dinner finally came out
All 3 steaks were cooked wrong
Then when we ordered desert, one of the two items ordered never came
When confronted about the service aftering sitting in the restaurant for two hours
The manager didn't believe us, and thought we were trying to scam them
We weren't trying to get a free meal, but an apology would have been nice
Service: We ordered a few apetizers and asked the waiter to bring the guacamole and chips first
it came about 15 minutes later with the rest of the apetizers
Food: Personaly I didn't like the food
Although it had mexican ingredients, nothing there had any flavor
just a big salad of items swimming in the same souce as the apetizers
The cod fish was overcooked and I am willing to bet that it was not even fresh
The frozen margaritas were week and too sour
Price: Way Over Priced!!! BIG DISAPOINTMENT!
If you are looking for great authentic Mexican food, helpful friendly service and atmosphere which makes you feel as though you are in the Heart of Mexico City, run, not walk, to La Palapa
Terrific Margaritas! Don't forget to save room for dessert
You will not be disappointed
La Palapa is a wonderful jewel in the East Village! I recommend a reservation because the wait can be long
The front part of the restaurant is loud, but the garden is wonderful, quiet and warm
The mango margarita is heavenly
I went with a party of four and no one was disapointed with their meal
They import the veggies from Mexico so it's authentic! This is a must go
dined at la palapa last night and had a homemade chosrizo and cheese stuffed gordita
It was delicious as was the fish special witha guacamole and tomatillo salsa
my hibisicus margarita also outstounding
I could taste the fresh lime
the food, the service and the value all are great
I will return
so will the friends dined with
The food and atmosphere were top notch
The owner was out and about in the diningroom,and that was really refreshing to see
We liked it so much we went back the next day and took 4 of our friends
After spending more money than intended, I felt even more disappointed in the food
The southwestern spices were more than overwhelming to the point where you couldn't taste the actual food!
$ of us had a Saturday brunch at La Palapa
I found the atmosphere quite confortable, the restaurant is bright and clean
I wasn't that thrilled with the food, though
I say stay away from the Bloody Marias and stick with the Marys (vodka); somehow tequila, tomato and horseradish make an odd combination
The Fruit of the Day offering is a joke - a very tiny portion of slightly oxidized canned pineapple, a sliver of unripe strawberry, why bother? I tried the french toast, also tiny, and way, way too sweet
The coffee was on the verge of being too old (over 20 minutes
) I have heard good things about their lunches and dinners, so I will give them another try
I've been to this restaurant 3 or 4 times
The first time was with a group for friend's birthday! It was great, we all felt it was one of the best meals we had

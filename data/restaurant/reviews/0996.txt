In a city with as many good restaurants as New York, there's no need to trek down to the East Village to pay seriously extraordinary prices for such ordinary food
It's good food, don't get me wrong
But it's just no better than any other good restaurant in New York
So for these sky high prices, you can do a lot better elsewhere
Not worth it
Go elsewhere
Everything about this place was wrong
The food was way overpriced, the portions were tiny (don't go if you are actually hungry) and the waitstaff is very inttentive and not helpful at all
One of the main reasons we went was because of the supposed homemade truffles that arrive at the end of your meal (personally delivered by the pastry chef and they were no where to be found
Save your money as you can get much better, quality, food service else where for less money especially on the Lower East Side where great, reasonable restaurants abound
A welcomed step above for the neighborhood
The space is very interesting and the food was well prepared, presented and served
They also space the seating nicely so you won't feel cramped and crowded, something I really appreciate
Highly recommended for a date or dinner with friends
The food was decent tasting but nothing spectacular
I went with my sister and neither of us had wine so the final bill was a bit shocking
I went by the reviews here but I'd have to say pass on this restaurant
I think this place is very average in general
I was quite excited to go given the reviews I had read, and I have to say I was rather disappointed
The service was extremely slow and the waiter was very opinionated
The food was good but too salty and nothig that special
Too expensive for what you get - especially when we smelled like fried food after we left (they sat us by the open-ish kitchen)
One of the more memorable meals I've ever had in New York
The food was divine, the service lovely, the wine list impressive
we weren't rushed and were seated on time
I truly couldn't have asked for a better dinner
The doughnuts are all they say!
I went last week for dinner and it was wonderful
My boyfriend and I had the tasting menu and we loved every course
The host, waitress, bartender and runners were all very friendly
The check came out a little high, but it was worth it
I probably can't dine here every week, but I would definitely go for special occasions
An outstanding spot for wine and food lovers
From the amuse soup to the petit fours, every bite was delicious
The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, and the wine list is superb- full of classic great wines and new quirky discoveries, organized by region and producer, with a hefty after dinner drink menu
It is rare that the waiters know details of food preparation and wines in most places, but here it's just the beginning
The flawless service and relaxed atmosphere raise the bar for all restaurants in the city
Hearth is expensive as far as East Village restaurants go, but I haven't had a meal that good in quite some time
I booked my hubby and I reservations well in advance for Valentine's Day (if I waited for him to do it, we'd have been dining at Burger King, but I digress
)
We opted for the prix fixe menu
The first course was amazing and everything just kept getting better
We had shrimp and scallops and lobster and it was as if I'd never tasted these things before
As for the atmosphere, it's simple and we really liked it
You'd feel comfortable taking a date there without feeling like you're trying to hard or going there with a group of friends (who have steady jobs)
RUN don't walk to get some of talented young Chef Marco Canora's gnocchi and other gustatory delights
Hearth is one of the best new restaurants to open in the past year - comfortable, fun, hip, and it has a great wine list and some of the best Italian-American food to be found anywhere
I haven't been disappointed by anything, and it's so charming to see a place where the owners are putting their heart and soul into the restaurant
Kudos!
I'd like to start by saying the food was great
Everything that came out of the kitchen was wonderful, it was just that everything else about the place was so sterile and unremarkable, the restaurant lacked as an overall experience especially for the money
Out server was completely devoid of personality, I felt like were were being waited on by a bald robot
The food runner who dropped off and explained the courses of the tasting menu was much more friendly and interested in our dining experience
The wine list was an the size of small novel and they're was no help offered in navigating it
The decor was that of an up scale cafeteria
The owners are obviously chefs/food oriented, but they need to hire some better servers, or better yet promote the food runners
I was thoroughly impressed
Everything from the service to the food to the ambiance was noteworthy
The octopus appetizer was cooked to perfection
The black bass melted in my mouth
Even the extra sides were great
The sweet potato puree was so creamy -- I wanted more! I would definitely recommend this restaurant
From the moment I walked in the door to the moment we left I felt as if our table was the primary focus of the evening
The bartender, the wait staff and management all put the customer first and that was clear and much appreciated
The food and wine selection were very impressive and did not disappoint
I would highly recommend this as a top East Village spot, although prices are higher than what you would typically find in that area
It is worth it!
If you love the EV, you'll love Hearth for its original cuisine, impeccable service, and extensive wine list
Eating here was one of the best dining experiences ever
Luckily we grabbed seats at the coveted kitchen area where chatted with the chefs and received first class attention while we enjoyed the action in the gourmet kitchen
It was truly an experience that I would repeat over and over
Everything was perfect
I love this restaurant
My experience at Hearth was wonderful
It really evokes the quality of its name - we went weekend before last when it was cold and wet outside, and Hearth was a great place to warm up
The service was very pleasant and not overbearing at all (we had a lot to catch up on, and the waiter recognized that)
I had the wild boar pappardelle, which was tender and delicious
But the best part was the pecan tart for dessert - the warm pecans were perfectly complemented by the scrumptious sweet potato ice cream! I'll definitely go back - as soon as I can get a reservation, that is!!
early dinner during holiday season -enjoyable but nothing to get excited about
I'd go back only if I lived in the neighborhood
Kitchen a bit heavy-handed with the salt and our waiter was a BONEHEAD
Couldn't speak well, couldn't pronounce the items, didn't know his wines and was so obviously trying to build his check it was embarrassing to experience and watch at other tables
He actually did a weird flounce every time a table didn't order bottled water
Our busser and runner seemed so much more professional and pleasant
VERY nice wine list and the food was DEFINITELY good
I went with a goup of 8 friends all in town for a visit from all over the country - since we were a large group and tried for a reservation on short notice we got 2 tables of 4 for late in the evening
Right before we left, they called to say they were able to put all 8 of us at one table- nice
The service was impeccable and the food in my opinion was top notch
Some of our group were not used to a small menu with these prices and ingredients, but they were all pleasantly surprised
I'd like to see more than one vegetarian option, but it was delicious
A bit noisy in there, but that could also be due to the extremely loud and obnoxious table next to us
I thought everything here was perfect
I cannot say enough about Hearth
It was one of the best overall dining experiences that I've ever had
The dinner was a bachelorette party and the bride to be, who is also a chef was very impressed and had a great time
The staff was attentive and welcoming, the wine list offers an amazing selection and the food was outstanding
Basically, they did everything right
The only slight drawback was the ambiance in the room where we sat, which lacks the warmth and coziness of the main room
My friend and I tried Hearth last night for the first time
It was one of the nicest dining experiences either of us have had in a very long time

if it wasn't for the food, i would not recommend this place at all
if you want great thai food, go to sea
remember to go during the day and sit in the front where there's light coming in
this place has been great since day 1
i live around the corner and haven't had better food, ambiance, quick service, and cheap eats
to the user who only left a $6 tip, you got what you deserve- who the hell do you think you are leaving such a measely tip?? you OBVIOUSLY are not from nyc
please stay at home- you are probably one of those customers who runs the waiter around, complains about everything, orders your entree with 5,000 changes, and then writes a complaint on citysearch
please move away, new yorkers hate 10% tippers like you
Food wasn't great, but we were having fun until the friend who bought dinner left a $6 tip
The man who worked there very rudely told her, the tax was $4! You only left $6! At first we had no idea what he was saying, and he said it to us twice more, both times rudely and unpleasantly
Okay, so that wasn't a great tip and she probably meant to leave a dollar more, but he's TELLING her to leave more?!?!?!?! We will NOT be going back
places i have ever eaten
the service is amazing, the food is unreal, and the prices are so low you won't believe the quality of food could be this good! take my advice and eat here soon!!
Walking toward the restaurant I literally expected a hole-in-the wall kind of restaurant
However I found the restaurant catered to hip, but low-key crowd of patrons
I had to get there early to put my name down for the group of 7 that I had
It was a bit confusing at first, but I finally found the waiter/host that told me that it would be a 45-50 minute wait
It turned out to be relatively accurate and my group showed up at about the right time to be seated
Overall, the food was quite tasty and reasonably priced
They offer a few types of beer, wine, and cocktails
Although small, this restaurant serves up quite a nice meal
Check it out if you're on the Lower East Side and are itching for some Thai
Enjoy
Sea has great food, no doubt about that
BUT, going here depends on what type of restaurant you're looking for
There are waits (no rezzies) which can be annoying, but once you're seated it's quick
Get some sangria and order a $4 appetizer (i love the puffs)
Entres are priced at around $7 - $8, specials being around $12
It's a great buy, with quick service but it's NOT romantic
I've had almost everything on the menu; my favorites are the Pad Woon Sen, Drunk Man noodle and Pad Thai
good selection of food, reasonable prices and to die for duck salad
I have been coming to Sea ever since it opened a couple of years ago
The pad-thai is simply the best in the entire city (trust me, I've tried them all)
Ever since I discovered their amazing dishes I haven't found any other restaurant that satisfies my craving for Thai food as completely as Sea
As further inducement, their prices are so reasonable that you can't afford not to try their food at least once if you are a true Thai-food afficionado
Take it from me, you'll be coming back for more
We went to Sea Thai because of it's high rating at Citisearch
However, our experience was definitely disappointing
The food is average, too salty and overcooked
Price is reasonable
Pad Thai here is the BEST I've had! This place is a great value - the food is excellent (been here a bunch of times and have never had anything that wasn't delicious) - the service is great and quite fast!   The ambience is makes for a really enjoyable meal - dim lighting, funky music, candles, and a cozy seating arrangement makes for a great place to have dinner with a group of friends or a date
MUST try the crispy banana dessert!
Just check it out, and tell me what you all think! I thought it was AMAZING! FOOD is cheap, and delicious
Service-great! DECOR IS SOMETHING OUT OF THE ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST! NOT TO BE MISSED
TAKE THE TRAIN, GO TO BROOKLYN! BE AMAZED!
This Thai restaurant is not expensive
It has a lot of creative dishes
Like Jumbo Shrimp Fried Rice for one
It is not your usual Thai restaurant
It also has nice romantic ambience
Miles ahead of most NY Thai food
Tup Tim Fritters are great
Stay away from big ticket entrees, but the noodle dishes are great, as are the basil ones
The fastest delivery in the neighborhood, too
\
The Scene Very quick, perfunctory service caters to a fast-moving line of takeout customers that often extends out the door
A few battered wooden tables do exist, but they're usually full and crammed against the wall
It's best to take your order back to the office, or over to nearby Washington Square Park
Taking a place of honor on the wall is a portrait of the portly Mamoun himself, circa 1971
The Food Cheap, very filling and good enough to consistently merit a mention in arguments over the best shawarma and falafel in the city
The creamy baba ghanoush and juicy tabbouleh aren't far behind, either
Dessert pastries, however, are dry and pallid
I used to get the tabouli sandwiches, but the last TWO times I got one, it was gritty like the parsley hadn't been washed
If you've ever eaten sand (not intentionally, I hope), you know how unpleasant this is
I've given up on the place
2 of my friends and myself went to mamoons last week, and got butt river for 6 days
I lost 15 pounds I recomend mamoons instead of a colonic because a colonic cost 60 bucks
don't get me wrong I will go back I need to lose 50 more pounds
Thanks Davide Renne
(sorry about readability here, this isn't taking my paragraph breaks
) Okay, we are falafel connoisseurs
not experts or snobs, but we like our falafel, and my girlfriend is even quite picky about it
So on our trip to NYC, we sought out the best falafel
And let me tell you, Mamoun's was the exact opposite of it
We got lucky by only having a short line; the positives ended there
The falafel sanwich there consisted of a pita filled with hummus, falafel, and other ingredients
To start with, the pita was nothing special-- their pitas are fresh, if you consider that to mean fresh off the truck from the distributor
They had 50 bags of pitas, the same kind you get at the supermarket, they'd rip open a bag and you hope that you don't get a dry one
For allegedly being the best, I'd expect more
this is the food capital of the world, they've got to be able to get better pita
Grade: C minus
The hummus was pasty, and chalky, yet was still really watery
NO THANKS, I like my hummus nice and spreadable and with a pleasing flavor
Again: pasty and CHALKY
And runny
Bring your soup spoon
Grade: F
The falafel ball itself: UTTERLY DEVOID OF TASTE
Are you kidding me? This place is the best? The falafel seriously had zero taste
The texture was okay, and it wasn't too oily, but I would hope for some actual FLAVOR
It had no kick or spice AT ALL
Your average falafel at any other place in the city will have more flavor
Grade: D
Other ingredients in the falafel sandwich: iceberg lettuce, pre-chopped in the bag, and diced tomatoes
Gee, thanks-- anything else that they can get in bulk for pennies, just to make you feel like you're getting a full sandwich? Grade: C minus
Other foods: the other thing we tried there was the tabouleh
They can't mess THIS up, I thought
But I was wrong
It had minimal bulgur-- which is a key component-- really, almost none at all! And the parsley-- the other key component-- was minimal too
Their tabouleh was basically chopped cucumbers with a bit of parsley

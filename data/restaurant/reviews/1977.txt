The food was not the best Thai food I've had
In fact, it seemed like American style Chinese food
Perhaps, the lunch time meals are catered to the coutroom/city hall crowd and less to the natives
If you love Thai curries as I do, this is the place to go
My favorite is the Penang curry
The rest of the food is great too, but I have been to places with better noodle dishes
Having lived in NYC (Upper West Side) for three years, I would always make the trek to Chinatown
Now, whenever I travel to NYC, Ponsgri Thai (Bayard location) is my first stop
The soups are light and delicious and cold salads VERY SPICY
Not for the faint of heart
OK, so five star environment, this is not, but come in jeans, ready to eat heartily
I have never had to wait for a table and service is speedy
Great value for the money
Enjoy!!!
The food here is pretty good
The price is average for Thai food
They seat you very fast since it doesn't usually get so busy at this location
The service is pretty good too, but that you can find in most of Thai restaurant anyway
Their seafood dishes are a bit too pricey though they are good
The decoration is nice, but being in chinatown makes this place not so romantic
My Mother was one of 12 in a very Italian family from Rochester N
Y
Going to Forlini's is like going to my mothers sister's for dinner
It brought back so many memories
The food is outstanding
The Tripe was a trip back in time for me
Just a great place for dinner
i haven't tried lunch there yet
Four Stars
We went in for di-nch (dinner/lunch) around 4:30p
There was an older guy running the bar who knew everyone (all 5 people) in the place
We got burgers and beer, very good
When you think old school Little Italy - this is the place
The bar still uses a real cash register that works
Definately - Charm! We were treated like family
no big fuss, no big muss, very casual and friendly, and the beer was fresh and cold
We will definately be going back for real dinner
Had dinner with a friend here on Wed
evening
The food was very good, the attmosphere was nice, clean linens, my only complaint was that with the main room 1/2 empty the service was VERY S L O W
I know that there is a difference between giving you time to eat and enjoy your food and slow service, this fell into SLOW service
Yes, I would go back but knowing full well that I can't have any pre-planned events afterwards
Forlini's is a true gem
The food is consistently excellent (I had the anolini in broth and cannolini last night -- both superb) and the service is professional in an old-school way
You won't find a better value, either -- pastas start as low as $10
So, the bathroom is a little dank, and the decor a bit dated
It all adds to the charm
Do yourself a favor and avoid the lunchtime crowd and head to Forlini's for dinner sometime soon
Stopped in at lunch, based on the outstanding reviews
Was a little skeptical, since the place is a little further south than most of the other good italian places
but it was an outstanding gustatory experience
a very friendly, and family style atmosphere
i had the gnocchi with pesto sauce, and it was hearty and excellent
my girlfriend had a penne with vodka sauce, which was also superb
the server was really nice, and everything was very prompt
as an aside, this place is quite big
i'm thinking that it would be a nice place to have a birthday dinner, as it appears it can easily hold a large party of 25+
it did fill up pretty quickly for lunch, but nobody seemed to have to wait too long, and i'm guessing they might be less busy for dinner
The food, the service, the restaurant everything is absolutely amazing
the food is fresh and melts in your mouth, the portion size is just right allowing you room for dessert
I felt like I was eating in my mother's Northern Italian kitchen - you can't choose anything bad because it does not exist at this place
The staff is extremely friendly, atmosphere cozy - you feel like you are in a restaurant in the mountains of Northern Italy
Definately a MUST for those who appreciate really Italian cooking - come la mama
Absolutely delicious food, prepared to order
They will modify dishes to your taste
Friendly, helpful waitstaff
Family owned, they make you feel part of the family
Great ambiance, old fashioned Little Italy
I have been here literally scores of times, have never once been disappointed Cops, judges, wiseguys, all peacefully coexisting over the terrific food atmosphere
Friendly, homey
Whatever you might want they will make for you and with such good taste you would think you were in Italy
I am a regular here for lunch
While some say it is a bit expensive for soup, I think it is worth it
Definitely a great place for a winter lunch!
The Scene There's a certain locomotive element here as all the dim sum carts go whizzing by
Small parties must share a table with others (it's not negotiable), and the freshest foods circulate before 3pm
The Food HSF offers all the dim sum favorites, such as pork buns, shumai dumplings and sweet egg custard pastries, as well as fried turnip cakes, shrimp balls and freshly braised vegetables
The steamed offerings are fresh and filling--try the shrimp rice noodles
The fried dishes, such as egg rolls and garlic pork dumplings, can be a bit too greasy
Dim sum is served here until 4pm, Monday through Friday, but menu items, including some unorthodox choices such as open skillet-cooked scallops, chive-infused dumpling varieties and dense, rich coconut pudding cubes, are also available
Or you can pick a live lobster from the tanks and have it cooked within minutes
Had a very dissapointing meal at HSF today
Food was not fresh and service was poor
They didn't clean the table before we sat and there were stains on the table cloth and on the plates and utensils
Service was worse than ever
I won't be going back to this place and would not recommend it to my friends
Cannot understand the rave reviews for this restaurant
On a Sunday morning the same 5 or 6 dim sum choices kept coming around over over again
Service was fair
Food was below average - bland and uninteresting
But one of the cheapest around
went with good pittsburgh friends had a feast
seafood selection is good with fresh displays to choose from
spiny crab was great choice
but must go in large group to experience the diverse dishes otherwise can't fully appreciate the cuisine
it is a little pricy but it's a seafood restaurant
no more chinatown prices! SUM IT: tasty choices
must try at least once, early week evenings best time to go
Ewwww
I've had better

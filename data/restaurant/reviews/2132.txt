BTW, this restaurant is the only sushi restaurant that has a loyal Japanese following that I frequent
How many Japanese restaurants do you go to that you've seen actual Japanese diners?
I have eaten here twice and have no idea how it gets such a high rating
I orderd the chirashi and found it to filled with tiny pieces of cheap fish that was rather stale
I alo ordered the tuna which was tough and stale
Delicious
Skilled sushi chefs
The sushi here is head and shoulders above anything else in the area
It's not trendy and glitzy like the celeb-packed places, but it is much more authentically japanese
You can really taste the difference when you order something like scallops--so much fresher
If you're a fan of Ikura - theirs has a nice fresh burst of flavor
Its worth it to order one of the specials or ask the sushi chef what is best that day because they really know their stuff
Looking for an authentic Japanese Sushi restaurant in Manhattan? Definitely try Mishima
Start with Sushi (counter) chefs appetizers, which are uniquely delicious; order Sushi deluxe with a side of calm miso soup
You wont regret it
Sushi deluxe comes with two Toros, and if you are a true Sushi enthusiast, then you would truly appreciate the authenticity of this restaurant
Don't forget to try upstairs too
I am so sick of fake Japanese places run by non-Japanese ppl in the city
However this place is different! I first ignored Mishima thinking that it'll be another Japanese-wanna-be-Chinese restaurant, but this place isn't anything like that
I'm now their regular
My recommendations? Try their lobster miso soup and sushi for two
Yeah it's not cheap but then again that's what you have to pay for getting an awesome real Japanese meal
Mishima has perfectly fresh sushi and wonderful menu choices
Though we are willing to spend any amount of money for fresh sushi, including the most high end restaurants in nyc, mishima provides the best value hands down
A fresh and filling lunch can run 10 dollars
Sake is premium and still priced really well
It's our favorite secret for our favorite food
If I can, I wish I can eat here everyday
As a Japanese food lover, I've tried out many Japanese restaurants in NYC and I have to admit this is one of the most authentic home style Japanese restaurants
You feel like you are in Japan
Sushi is always fresh and portions are pretty big and satisfying
Try their delux sushi and sashimi set for 2, an excellent choice! Also if you can, try their daily specials, good value and fresh
I had a grilled whole sea bass and yellowtail neck for $13
50 each
Their appetizers are excellent as well, including octopus salad, grilled sardine and grilled squid, nothing disappointing
Excellent choice for people on Atkin's diet
=) Their Japanese style desserts were good too
I had Japanese style cheese cake which was very creamy and flavorful yet it wasn't as heavy as 'American' cheese cake
Was surprised to find such good sushi in the middle of India-town! Sushi was fresh (a bit pricey, but so is all good sushi in NYC these days)
Nice wooden dining room - very (maybe too) modern, though
A very good meal ~ $90 for 3 persons
I haven't eaten a whole lot of sushi in my day, but Mishima is the best I've tried
The portions aren't huge, but the fish is oh so fresh
Decor is rather spartan, and the service was accommodating (though I won't go so far as to say 'friendly')
I'll revise this rating as I try more, but Mishima is worth the trip
There is nothing to complain about this place! The staff is so courteous, and the food is wonderful
The sushi is fresh and delicious, very authentic! All for a reasonable price
There are many regulars, they just keep coming back!
Great food, the service is perfect, and the prices in check
I've gone here many times over the years and Tre Pomodori has always been able to satisfy
It is a small restaurant and therefore I usually I go with 1-3 other people; but they have even been able to accomodate a party of 10 of us in the back
Their pre-dinner bread and tray (a small plate of hummus, olives and tomato dipping sauces) is a nice treat and the entrees delectable
The prices are the best in italian that you will find in the area, and the portions are just right
Highly Recommended!
The food here is always good, but don't go here looking for haute cuisine
The prix fixe menu is a bargain
The service is always pleasant; however, one time we were seated at 6:50pm, but our orders were not taken until after 7:00
The amount of time did not bother me; however, the waiter told me that we could not order from the prix fixe menu despite the fact that we had been waiting to place our orders since before 7:00
We were allowed to order from the prix fixe menu only after speaking to the head waiter, who told us that he was making an exception this time
I haven't had a problem since and still recommend this place for the bargain that it is
This delicious Italian restaurant is truly a hidden treasure on 34th Street
Incredible, homemade, delicious Italian food at such a decent price
The place is a little small but the food and the service completely make up for any flaw this place could have
Definitely recommended
This place was extremely romantic
Very cozy and perfect for you and your loved one to spend an evening alone
The service was great when we got there, there was olive oil spilled on the table and the immediately moved us to a new table
The food was really great and the prices were unbelievably cheap for such great food and good portions
THe only drawback i found to the restaurant was that it's a lil too cozy, the place is extremely small- u have to walk single file down a narrow path between tables- and its the only path there is
what's good about this place is the atmosphere and the value
All dishes were very affordable, not very typical for a NY restaurant
However, the food was mediocore at best
One thing in particular really irked me about this place
My salad was supposed to come with mushrooms and they came raw, which is fine
I politely asked if the cook could heat them up and the answer was no
So, the offered to give me warm portobellos on the side
I said ok, and they charged me an extra $8 for it
This is the type of sevice that would prevent me from going back there
Went last night with my boyfriend, it was romantic and small
When I saw the prices, I was surprised but I thought you got a small portion
What A surprise, Big portions and the waiters were so nice
And the food was really good too
Good food, romantic, nice staff
Must go when you can
Spent Valentine's weekend in NYC with my honey
Our budget is a little tight, so we used Frommer's $75 and less per day guidebook, which recommended Tre pomodori
Incredible! Excellent food, excellent service and very romantic
This place was so great, I almost want to keep it all to myself! THe food is so good, yet so inexpensive you may feel a little guilty when the check arrives!
Great little neighborhood place! The pastas are fresh, the dishes authentic, the service is good, the atomosphere is cozy and the tabs can't be beat
I have been going to the place for a few years now, and have enjoyed it each and every time
A failsafe Italian restaurant that never lets me or my friends down
After a tearful breakup, a couple of girlfriends took me to tre pomodori to cheer me up
Not only was I pleasantly surprised by the adorable atmosphere and the reasonable prices (not to mention the oh so good looking maitre'd), I was blown away by the amazing food
this restaurant is truly a sleeper
Fabulous and a well kept NYC secret
It's now a regular for me and my friends (sans the maitre'd, he's since moved on
)
I was caught in what I would call a ny monsoon
when I found I ran into this little restaurant
I was offered a hot tea as I sat down which was exactly what I needed to warm up

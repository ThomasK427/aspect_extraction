Diler was very kind and personally treated me to several large portion samples of foods! I felt very spoiled and loved the personal attention, as I am on this biz trip solo without hubby! I feel as if I've made new friends and THANK GOD the food is absoultely incredible so I can confirm the great things I have read prior to my experience
Thank you to all at Bombay Palace for making my dining exerience so great and yummy!
The restaurant is beautiful and the ambience is very comfortable, yet stylish
We had the banquet/feast for two, and it was amazing
It was delicious and very filling, and we got a chance to taste a little of everything on the menu
The service was great and incredibly friendly
The bill was also very reasonable, especially for all that we had
Also, being a Friday night, as well as around theater time, we ended up staying for almost 3 hours, obviously without feeling one bit rushed
Cannot say enough great things about the Bombay Palace, we will definitely make it a regular!
I liked the food and the ambience here
Initially, we were seated at a table where I could feel the cold wind when the door opened
I requested the waiter to seat us at a different table, and he was like 'its the same everywhere', and walked off
Anyway, I and my hubby moved to a warmer place
We had another waiter to serve us, which was good
I have to say, though, that the food was not extraordinary, but the service was good
The only reason I will go back here is when I cannot think of any place else to go
The overall experience was great - good food, nice ambience, great service
All for reasonable prices, especially in Midtown
I was very happy with the experience overall
I love this restaurant! The ambience is very elegant, with painted portraits of great maharajas hanging on dark mahogany walls, and a majestic chandallier
The food is very good, although, I must admit, I've had better
The service is very attentive and personalized
The manager stopped by our table several times to ensure our satisfaction
Overall, I highly recommend this place for any special occasion
$12
95 for a decent buffet
Not bad tasting, but I've had better
I might go there again if i were in the neighborhood
The service was really good
Bombay Palace has some of the best Indian food I've ever had
Not being Indian, I can't vouch for its authenticity, which other reviewers have criticized, but it simply tastes great! The service tends to be a little bit laid back, perhaps even inattentive, and the pricing is a little bit steep, but overall it's a good value, and worth a visit
The appetizer - Aloo Papri - has so much sauce on it, it looks like a main curry dish
Anyone from India will frown on it
The service is so awful for such an expensive restaurant
I guess one has to pay extra to make the waiters smile
Don't think of taking your girlfriend/wife for an date/anniversary
Sangria was on point
The food was plentiful, tasty, and inexpensive
A great after-show family spot
Ah Spain, the service was authentic
We were forgotten, fawned over, forgotten again, then treated to free drinks
The food was excellent The service was friendly, but not exactly organized
(I'll get your waiter
oh wait, I AM your waiter)
Lots of regulars here

My second visit to Costa Del Sol
I ordered the Paella with Lobster
It was as delicious as the first time ordered
An ideal location for pre-theatre meals
The menu is offers a great deal of selection; unfortunately, they were out of the Soft Shell Crabs on this visit
On a previous visit, my friend had the Lobster tail stuffed with crab meat--I'll try that on a a future visit
But Costa del sol, which has a great deal of seafood, also has some great meat and vegetarian dishes
I had the prix fixe and loved it
The waiters were alot of fun since we were eating rather late
I had a fabulous time, better than I've had anywhere in a long time
I'm going back soon!
The prix fix are a wonderful deal
The sangria is so good
and if only going for drinks the bar is wonderful
Great restaurant - The food was surprisingly good, big portions in spite of the plain ambience and impersonal service (but at least it is fast)
It is a nice change because you aren't cramped into a little corner instead it is a more spacious family style restaurant - like what you would find in the suberbs
The seafood is incredible - huge portions, really good sauces and great desserts
Try the seafood including shrimp, mussels, clams and scallops in an olive oil, garlic and parsley sauce for only about $15

They also have lobster for only $20

A great dessert is the vanilla custard
After so many positive reviews, I decided to partake in the fun and order from West Side Chefs for a change
After $30 of wasted money, I can vouch the experience was definitely one in vain
The food had little flavor and if it did, it was usually too salty
Case in point, the roast duck seemed like it was marinated in some of the saltiest sauce ever as was the beef chow fun
The service seemed decent and the delivery was okay, but when its strictly delivery there is only so much non-food related attributes you can depend on
Never again
not only is this restaurant affordable but they also have the option on ordering white meat with all your orders
what a nice treat
This restaurant is even considered healthy
with no MSG
EVERYONE at work loves it
it's quick delivery, fast service and DELICOUS chinese
By far the best i've had here in NYC
love it
Give them a chance
the white meat sesame chicken is the BEST!!!!!
Fried rice had chicken gristle and mealy peas, ruining an otherwise flavorful dish
Roast pork bun full of slightly tough and dull tasting bits of pork and onion, rather than the customary sweet and savory thick meat paste
Finally, friend green beans were simply garlicy, and lacking in deliciousness
Would order from them again if I had to, but not highly recommended
This place is so good! I have been ordering in Chinese Food for years, and the consistant, quality and service from West Side Chef is awesome!   They are couteous, and never rush you on the phone
I went to eat in one day, and my guess was correct - they are very nice and the food is terrific!
I was real hungry and in the area, i was delighted with the quality of food being served at Sitar, very inexpensive and high on quality
Its the simplest things in Sitar that make the best impression
The chicken tikka and lentils were superb and the dessedrt (rice pudding) was a great way to end a meal
As as an Indian, this restaurant is on my top 10
Good food, right amount of spices and variety of food (esp
vegetarian!)
I'd recommend it
$9
95 lunch buffet, with a wonderful selection of meats, salads, vegetables
A great place if you are just learning to like Inidan

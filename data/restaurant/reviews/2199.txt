They're real nice too
J2 has REALLY good food and their new sushi bar is pretty good too!
decent pizza
not the best but cheap food on broadway near midtown
This VERY tiny pizza joint is definitely a hole in the wall -- with no tables, only a sidebar to lean on
The store itself felt dirty and run-down, which made me feel a little wary about the food
Prices/food was alright, but this is just a place to go if you're in a rush
Bryant Park Caf is in a fantastic location and the atmosphere is wonderful
The caf itself has little to offer
Service is slow and less than friendly
The food was disappointing at best and this is coming from a NYer who is not difficult to please
One would think in New York that a cheeseburger would be difficult to ruin
Over-cooked and bland is a generous description
They were also sold out of fries which we were told at the last minute
Bryant Park is one of my favorite areas to sit and people watch
There is just something so beautiful and tranquil about this park situated in bustling midtown
The cafe is a great place to lounge in
Especially pleasant in the spring, I would go there in comfortable clothes and split a bottle of wine with some friends
The liquor is decent though nothing exceptional and the food is basically finger food
Service is forgetful at times but, who cares when you have nothing better to do on a lazy, hazy Sunday afternoon
FYI, if you go there for happy hour it will be packed
Bryant Park is one of the most beautiful spots in the city
Bryant Park Cafe has the perfect spot to be successful
Unfortunately, the service is slow and pretty industrial, the food is below average, and finally plates, glasses and cuttlery tend to be dirty
With the increase in the number and quality of outdoor restaurants/cafes in NYC, Bryant Park Cafe's performance is very disappointing, especially given the location
The only thing I could recommend is to have a drink at the bar and avoid the grill restaurant
In Short Founded in 1950 in Massachusetts, Dunkin' Donuts has made a name for itself with a menu of breakfast items and sweet treats
In addition to more than 30 varieties of doughnuts and their holes ("Munchkins"), offerings include bagels with gourmet cream cheese and hot breakfast sandwiches, like English muffins with ham, eggs and cheese
The restaurant prides itself on its popular house coffee, too--the same blend that it has brewed since Day One
There is nothing as pathetic and sad as walking into a Dunkin' Donuts in New York City
When one is surrounded by some of the best coffee shops in the western hemisphere, the consistently sub-standard, watery, sweet swill that passes for coffee, served in a place with all the ambiance of a deserted bus terminal should not even be an option
And they're still using styrofoam
Dunkin Donuts coffee is awesome
Especially the flavored coffee, it just gives you that extra caffine boost you need to start your day
It helps you wake up and get moving towards the things you have to do that day
Dunkin donuts has always had the best coffee no matter where in the world you get it! There is no comparison
Their Hazelnut flavor rocks and so inexpensive, maybe they should raise the price and serve it in fancy cups with corrugated paper sleeves and people might appreciate it more, but who cares
!
Dunkin Donuts has the best coffee in the city
Its doesn't taste burned like Starbucks and it costs about half
Plus there are no pretentious idiots standing in line with you
Are you kidding? Synthetic doughtnuts and tastless coffee? Is it really the best coffee in NY? So what is the worst?
I love Dunkin' Donuts coffee! I was a Starbucks snob for 4 years, but I switched over because the coffee there just plain sucks
I love Hazelnut
Dunkin Donuts coffee greatest cup i've ever tasted
better than Starbuck's
i wouldn't go for the iced coffee, though, unless you speficy to not use flavored beans
It's played out, I know, but there's no better tasting coffee than DD
Don't buy the donuts, stick with Krispy Kreme
Amazingly Fresh Donuts!!! Good Coffee!! What else do u want?
Dunkin donuts is the best! I loved their glazed donuts and their coffees
Starbucks coffee is too strong for my tastes
Best bang for the buck around here
Coffee is not acidic, a common trait found in the evil green icon behemoth, wholesome, fresh and of course those ever so yummy donuts
This is like giving McDonalds or Burger King best Burger
is this about knowledge of real coffee and quality
I have to question how DD can even be in the top 20 in the amazingly cultured and knowledgable city
DD has the best coffee in the city, hands down
The french vanilla is my personal fav
For a real treat add a coffee cake mufin with the coffee, an awesome combo
You think because it's a chain, it won't be that good
But it rules
Buy some today
Now
Dunkin Donuts has the best coffee, if you like a medium roast coffee this is the one to get
You can't beat the price
I like Starbucks but sometimes you can overdose on the caffeine in one cup but with Dunkin Donuts its just as good at 3pm as it is at 8am
I've had Starbucks and that's good too
I only started drinking Starbucks because the Dunkin Donuts by me closed
Still Dunkin Donuts has the best value and coffee
If you want a good, medium-brewed to strong cup of coffee
why spend more money at Starbucks? Dunkin Donuts delivers a mean cup of java and some pretty good donuts
In Short Walls covered with decades of Top-40 memorabilia, rock songs blaring in the background and an all-American menu typify this music-themed restaurant
The kitchen churns out group-friendly appetizers like nachos and Southern staples like barbecue ribs and chicken
Burgers are served with hefty sides of fries and the signature pulled-pork sandwich is topped with vinegar barbecue sauce
The gift shop sells branded items like T-shirts, shot glasses and hats
I ate at the Hard Rock Cafe NYC in July of 2003
I was very satisfied with my meal
I almost always order the Pig Sandwich, which is the Hard Rock's version of a pulled pork sandwich
always very good
also it's always neat to check out the rock n roll memrobilia they have displayed throughout
quick service overall very happy
Yeah, sure it is always crowded and the music is loud but that is the point
The food is awesome (I haven't had anything that I didn't like yet) the enviroment is fun and this resturant combines the two best things, good food and good music
Forget serious, stuffy four and five star resturants, life is to short to morgatge your house and dress all stuffy for a meal
If you are looking for a quiet place to share a dinner than this is not for you but if you want to have fun, people watch and listen to some great music (almost always great music) than this is it
I may not be a fancy resturant reviewer but I know what I like
I recommend the veggie fajitas and the veggie burger
This restaurant is a great find for any lover of great food and great music
We got seated right away, had a very nice waitress, food was good, not too expensive
The food was excellent! Great Service very friendly
No long wait for table
I would recommend it for anyone
The Scene Three wood-lined dining rooms sprawl for what seems like half a block, festooned with black-and-white photos of former sports legends, chandeliers made with thick logs and a wonderful old mahogany bar populated by an assortment of well-dressed patrons, tourists and young steak-loving guys
Diners are served by tuxedoed captains and waiters
The Food The star of this classic American steakhouse menu is the 28-day aged beef, which is exceptionally tender and full-flavored--you can see the aging-wood locker as you walk in
Go for the generous sirloin or the porterhouse, both grilled over hickory
Double rib lamb chops are superior as well
If for some reason you arrive craving seafood, grilled swordfish is light and satisfying
The supporting cast includes steak fries, creamed spinach, tasty hash browns and strawberry shortcake

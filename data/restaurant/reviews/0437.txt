Appetizer of phyllo triangles was pretty good
The entree was the problem
Skirt steak was the consistency of rubber
Not edible
Foccacia bread tasted like fish
Menu does not warn that the Meatloaf entree has cheese in it
When I told the waitress I had a cheese allergy she took the plate and came back as if I had put her our and said the entree had cheese in it
When I asked if I could have the skirt steak she brought it to the table as if she could not be bothered
They did not ask how are food was
We asked for the check and no one saw us out or asked why we had not finished are meal
Save your money and go to La Caridad
Too pricey for the worst food I have had in a long time
Ate dinner on a Saturday night - fantastic food, fantastic presentation - the banana pudding was to die for!!! Deborah herself was in the kitchen and came out to chat with us and see that all was good
Adorable space - definitely one of my new favorites
As the owner and chef, Deborah, put it
Fine dining at prices that let's you be a regular
From the wine to starters, mains to dessert, everything was presented like a picture and the taste made you want to lick your plate
I reccomend the Grilled Shrimp Avocado Salad and the Chocolate Dessert in a cup (some French name
it's AMAZING
) Deborah also offered to do a tasting menu for our group at some point, we'll def
be taking her up on that
I am a huge fan and cannot say enough good things about this place
The food is superlative - wonderful new american menu - very inventive and flavorful twists on traditional comfort food - and completely affordable
Deborah, the chef and co-owner, is an extraordinary talent - she has not received the notoriety she deserves - and her food, while not expensive, really merits a two or three star rating
Co-owner David is a stunning, elegant presence and welcomes each and every guest as if they were entering his own living room
This restaurant is a rare find in New York
Excellent food, charming hosts, a relaxing, unpretentious, yet fashionable environment, and when the bill arrives, you won't feel like you have to take out a second mortgage on your apartment!
If you come to eat at Deborahs, you must get the steak, its unbelievable
The decor and ambience is great
Its small but cozy, also get the crab cakes
in the year or so that my girlfriend and I having been coming to this restaurant we have become friends with the owners and really enjoy eating here
espcially fo rbrunch, which is one of the best in the city
the duck confit hash and ranchero eggs are awesome, and she makes the best ceasar sallad i've ever had
The fusion of flavours was original but successful
The inclusion of healthy and diverse vegtables and herbs made for lively and unusual dishes
The calamari was lightly battered and went well with a salad
The lamb was slightly over cooked and the service, if I had to criticize, was too vigilant
But, overall, it was well priced and delicious
I've been here twice, and will not come again
The first time, we chalked up bad service to the new start
No excuse the second time
Pork pink in the middle (no excuses!) and everything over salted inc
fish and chips
Too bad
Yummy food and good ambience doesn't have to come at a high price
The menu is so reasonably priced that you'll do a double take, given the caliber of food and service
That's why Deborah is my favorite new restaurant in NYC
At first glance, the menu looks like standard New American Fare
But the way Deborah prepares and cooks the food is fit for the harshest of food critics
The hummus is prepared warm, the salads unbelievable and generously sized, the fries addictive
Deborah can take anything (lamb, sushi tuna, salmon, chicken, veggies) and turn it into a true culinary delight
Highly Highly recommended
The only thing is that the space is very narrow and tight
Intimate dining in a neighborly ambiance, this restaurant has been justifiably hailed in nearly every magazine devoted to New York
The owners are always there to assure prompt, warm service from an attractive competent waitstaff--and to supervise the affordable, near-gourmet meals
Try the Duck Confit Hash (topped with two eggs) or the Beer Battered Fish Chips on the Brunch menu
Deobrah's kitchen graces even these proletarian dishes with a taste and texture that is divine
At last! A restaurant that occupies that hallowed middle ground between the expensive, fancy places on Carmine Street south of Bleecker and the fast food joints on the street's north end
Just for openers, the huevos rancheros were prepared in a style that is Deborah's own, like nothing else I've ever tasted (and just hot enough
a real accomplishment!)
Intimate without pretense and cheerful without guile, this restaurant is a truely fine additon to the Street
This place was pretty cool and trendy, just a bit narrow
The waiters were well-mannered, but that's only if you see them around
Good food and cozy ambiance
The food and wine prices are very reasonable, and the service is warm and friendly
Cute, cozy place (don't go if long narrow places are not your scene) with good music, bustling activity and good service
The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good
Somewhat disappointing wine list (only new vintages
Think 2000 and newer) but for the value, it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group
They also have a cool outdoor patio w/one table (reserve for group dinner)
My boyfriend and I ate here and really enjoyed ourselves
It is a classy yet informal little joint with exposed brick walls
The portions are really large and almost all the entres have an asian influence
The Scene On a block where manicure parlors seem to outnumber residents, this pristinely designed trendy restaurant stands as one of its more startling anomalies
Curious teenagers, drawn by the kaleidoscopic signage and sleek looks, stare through the windows
Inside, youthful servers navigate patrons through the tricky menu with ease
The Food Scott Ehrlich's cerebral New American food demands both close attention and a certain amount of faith; even when dishes aren't entirely successful, they manage to be compelling
Dive headfirst into crisp-skinned duck confit with black-eyed peas and dried cranberries, moist and meaty hanger steak with a richly concentrated jus and head-on shrimp cast over a rollicking mix of persimmon, mint and butternut squash
For dessert, close your eyes and let candied avocado work its strange magic over creme caramel
The last reviewer goes to a brunch on new year's and complains about a 30 minute wait
I don't think they understand New York Brunch
Anyways, onto my experience
Deliciously inventive food and drinks
The beef brisket was tender and succulent, the acorn squash adorned with different mushrooms was creative and tasty
The drinks were mixed to perfection
Our wait staff was very attentitive, but by no means overbearing
I will definitely go back to Alias and bring friends
A standout in an already great neighborhood for restaurants
Our group of 5 people waited about 30 mn outside for a table, which is fine for a good brunch place
Once we got our table, we waited another 15 mn to get our orders taken even though I had indicated to our waiter that we were ready to order
We had Eggs Benedict: decent eggs, stingy on the cream, good bacon
Their talked-about Goetta (some type of cheese) comes with the Eggs benedict: it's essentially fried cheese, similar to mozzarella but with a burnt taste
No bread with the Eggs Benedict
The veggie taco was good, and the steak and eggs was very good
Service is poor, no one checked on us for the 1h15 min we were there
Perhaps dinner is a better deal
i was kinda disappointed by this place
i would not call it trendy by any means
the interior is kinda like a small, bad diner - and with no kitsch value
i did have a delicious strawberry salad and my meal was good, but the service was really slow and poor, and the pricing fairly high

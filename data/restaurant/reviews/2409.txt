The service was very good, fast, and enthusiastic
The atmostphere was perfect for a nice, romantic evening
It has already become one of my favorite restaurants, and the tuna tartar is the best I've ever had
We got reservations the same day
There was no wait for the table when we arrived
The food was simply perfect
The mussels were phenomenal
One must have them as an appetizer
The service was also great
The waiter was very efficient and attentive
It's a great place for a date as the ambiance is cozy and romantic
I've been going to Jubilee for almost 6 years now
Every time I go it is as perfect as day one
Service, food quality, comfort never varies and that's what I like so much about Jubilee
I have NEVER been let down by them
The food is amazing and I love their steak tartare macbarge
Made a reservation on same day
Very nice selection of appetizers, mussels and entrees
They have 5-6 different broth for mussels
I didn't try it this time, but will probably next time
Food was great, waiter was very friendly and talkative
I highly recommend the rack of lamb for entree and the warm goat cheese salad for apetizer
The only thing: I would match most dishes on their menu with red wines, and they only have a few red under 50$, so be ready to (maybe) pay a little more than what you are used to for wine
Service is great, the waiters are very good for wine recommendations
Mussels are a must but the best dish is the rack of lamb, it is out of this world
Careful, though, it can make a dent in your wallet
My friend and I had dinner at jubilee, the food was excellent, very good service and the attention goes to the very charming hostess who gave us a table even though we didn't have a reservation, the place was crowded, little loud but we had a very good experience
Sometimes you have less-attentive, non-rushed, what's-your-hurry, TRUE French bistro service! I think it's always worth the short wait to feel as if you're 1,000 miles away, cradled in a warm atmosphere with consistently excellent food
The mussels are prepared a number of different ways (try the curry!), and they will always make every effort to adjust the menu to suit your taste or dietary needs
So slow down a bit and enjoy it
the service is prompt
their bread basket is generous and delicious and fresh
pasta's are hot and delicious
i wish they would give just a little more! but great deal for lunch, all around 10
try their pasta bolognese
delish
My daughter and I was looking for somewhere to eat, we first past the Fresh Brasil/s Trattoria, and then came back to it, the waiting time was next to none, the service was wonderful and the food was the best we have tasted in a long time
Wonder place must eat there when in the city
I have eaten at Fresh Basil numerous times and never encountered anything but good food and good service
The waiters were attentive to us
My friend and I had arrived at the restaurant and we still were waiting for 2 more members of our party
Our 2 friends didn't arrive until an hour later! We got there at 6:30 and stayed until 9:30 PM
Our waiter was great to us the whole time
1 positive - their gnocchi mixed green salad with balsamic dressing is excellent, the rest of the menu is just ok
calarmar was so so, sauce was cold
svc was terrible - unattentive curt
waited for our bill long time - you would think they want turnover
pricey for this quality of food svc
SUM IT: again gnocchi mixed greens were best, otherwise try elsewhere
Not to far from Bloomingdales the N/W/R 456 trains
this is a great place to sit and relax for some fine Italian cusisine
Priced moderately for Manhattan, I highly recommend this place for a nite out with friends, or a night out with your significant other
The ambiance leaves something to be desired, but the food doesn't
Fresh Basil has great Veal Marsala
Great Value
You get a salad and a small plate of pasta with every entree
And the tomato sauce is really tasty
Mediocre food served by rude waiters who really don't care
Extremely crowded at lunch time
Don't bother it's not worth it!
The food could be better, the ambience is loud and unwelcoming during lunch, and the service is not only inattentive but also disgusting
Let me qualify the disgusting comment: one of the wait staff was carrying our food in both hands and suddenly sneezed into our food
Instead of taking it back, he nonchalantly placed our plates on the table without a word
We were mortified, and that's enough reason for me to never want to go back even though I can think of a few other reasons
Take Away order was delivered within 30 minutes and the food was delicious not to mention fresh
A great value for classic Tex Mex food
Lots of market souveniers line the walls, friendly people, very fast service
Plates overflows with refried beans, rice and your entree
The hot sauce is very fresh and yummy
Not a place for a dieter but definitely stick to the ribs yummy border mexican food without a big chain feel
Friendly atmosphere and yummy food served by nice staff - glad we found it
I have been trying to find cheap mexican that is good since I moved to the city and I am so happy that I tried this place
The ingredients used are all extremely fresh and delicious and everything is made to order
The chicken, steak, cheese, tortillas, salsa, guac, everything used is fresh and amazingly tasty
I had the Enchiladas Suizas and the quesadillas to share for a starter and both were amazing
This restaurant is small, but they do deliver and the food is a great price
I highly recommend this restaurant for amazing non gourmet mexican!!!
At first I must admit with a name like Ah Chiuaua
how can it be good? Sounded like it could have been a dumpy Mexican place with Chevy's-like food
However, I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent Tex Mex food! The salsa was spicy and tantalizing
And the entreacute;es were delightful!   I went with a group of girlfriends and we had quite a time taking in the festive atmosphere whilst drinking several pitchers of margaritas
I highly recommend Ah! Chihuahua for excellent Mexican eats!
Kind of overrated
Cute place, but food was not as good as others said it was
just status quo
Small, so would be a good place for a large group to take over the restaurant for an occassion
Only one kind of tequilla - definitely a let down on that front
Decently priced tho
The restaurant looks ordinal from the street, but it is spacious! My favorite is the backyard and sunroom seating area
When it's warm, definitely ask to be seated there
The only explanation for this place's popularity is the scarcity of cheap restaurants in the Sutton Place area
Sservice is lacking: the female bartender is downright rude and unaccomodating
There is only 1 waiter working the entire restaurant
Since he seems to know the clientele, he dawdles at every table, resulting in a 10 minute wait for your menus
Busboys are used to fill in and they are somewhat effective
The food: barely mediocre
Sauce tastes canned
You can find better in any other neighborhood
Also, too LOUD
Although this is a spot for regulars, I find it lacking in some of the basics of a good restaurant = SERVICE

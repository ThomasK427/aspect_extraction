But the service from the hostess to the waitress was rude and disappointing
To top it off was the 20% gratuity that was added to our tab even though we were ONLY TWO PEOPLE!! Avoid this restaurant and AVOID the new on they're opening up!!
I went to Horus last night with 3 friends to get a hookah
When we showed up, the guy at the door said it would be 15 minutes and that we could wait by the bar
30 minutes later, he escorts us to a table that barely fits between the two tables next to it and that 4 people could never actually sit at
He told us we would have to sit there or wait for another table to open up
I used to love this place, but after being treated like that, I will not return
woooow , i had a great time , the staff was so nice ,the belly dancer was hot , i felt like i was back in cairo , we had to wait for 20 min to get in , but it was so worth it
I WENT THERE LAST WEEK FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAD A GREAT TIME , FOOD WAS GREAT , THE HOOKAHS WERE GREAT , WE LOVED THE BELLY DANCER , THE MUSIC WAS GREAT , GREAT CROWED , I WILL HAVE MY BIRTHDAY PARTY THERE FOR SURE
I made reservations for my birthday-about 20 people saturday to sit in the tent section
It was raining, a bunch of people were late, the 1st couple people showed up 10 minutes late, the rest -a little over a half hour late, but it was raining hard
We were rushed to order food - they said they could only hold the space for 2 hours, I was NOT told this over the phone and we planned to stay longer
Before 2 hours were up, they started to tell us to leave, we didn't even finish eating
I spoke with the manager, he didn't seem to care that all of my guests were unhappy, then wanted to move us to another table, they even charged us for a hookah that we didn't order
It was a terrible experience
About 10 people RSVP'ed NO because they had similar past experiences
I went there for my bday had a group of 7 and the service was EXCELLANT the waiter Ivan was very nice and accomodating
Food was very good
The belly dancer however was not very good she looked like she was 12 and the hookahs are $20 not $10 as advertised
They say free entrance but you must spend $20 a person so its not really free
The music was great and it gets packed so dont go late we unfortuntely were kind of kicked out of our table for another reservation but still very cool place
Oh and the tent really isnt a tent just a table and cushions close to the floor
Overall good food and nice place I would defintely go back again!
first went on a jam-packed saturday night--LOTS of fun bellydancing to the arabic music after puffing on GREAT strong good quality sheesha
absolutely lush sexy ambience and decor and eye candy on the weekends ;) my friends' favorite hookah bar in town
With only 4 reviews of this place - two of which are horrible and two of which are positive - and no staff review, how can it get an 8
6 rating?   Humm, I wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that the restaurant has paid to have a message from this business on the site
?
There is not enough space to write about how awful my experience was here
Made a reservation in person 3 days before event
Requested tent seating
Upon arrival, was told there is a 20 dollar cover (was not told about this when making reservation, and Website also states there is no cover) Was treated very poorly by so-called manager who also tried to tell me he was the owner (I know who the owner is
This idiot most certainly was not him) We were not given the seating we requested (Even though packed, that area I requested 3 DAYS BEFORE was open) I asked him to please seat us where I made the reservation
He said we had to order dinner too! (It was midnite! I ate dinner already!) When I started to argue with him stating he was rude, unfair and an a-hole we were asked to leave
This place is definetely addictive
I went there on a Friday night and at first it was not busy but the atmosphere was still great
The dim lights and variety of music makes you feel as if you aren't in New York
We ordered the lamb tagine and mezza combo which were to die for
As the night progressed the place filled up in a blink of an eye
Suddenly the music got louder and a beautiful belly dancer came out
She came over to the table and made everybody dance with her
This made the night even more memorable
As I said this place is addictive, I returned on Saturday and Sunday and I continue to go every weekend
This place is FAB! everytime we go we have a great time
Note that if you get there early you'd almost think the place is closed, but if you go late you wonder if they ever close at all! If you want a quiet dinner don't show up late, cuz the atmosphere gets louder and more loungy as the nite goes on
There's usually a DJ, and the Belly Dancers are real good at getting people to join them, (even the guys jump in) The vibe is totally warm and friendly, lots of conversation people jumping up to dance
The kabobs are delish, and the hookah flavors are amazing
We usually start with the Mezza Combo appetizer platter, big enuff for 2
There's never a cover charge for the dancers DJ, the gratuity is conveniently added to the bill automatically
Highly recommend, bring your friends, they'll thank you
I am usually super relaxed when it comes to service and food, especially since I was a waitress for 3 years and understand how certain nights and timing can interfere with the service and quality
But my experience here left me feeling horrible! First, the prices on their menus are inaccurate/oudated, as we discovered when the bill came
Second, for the PRICE, the SERVICE should have been BETTER
Our service was indifferent and absent-minded, from ALL of the waiters
THIRD, THE FOOD IS HORRIBLE
Fourth, they added 18% gratuity to our check for only 2 ppl! Without WARNING
GoWasabi has been the local sushi place my girlfriend and I go to
The food isn't bad, (but it's not great either)
When I first started going there, the service was good
They'd great you at the door, promptly sit you and give you tea and water as requested
However, over the course of the year, we started noticing subtle changes particularly with the service
We would have to flag down the bored looking wait staff to refill our tea
Our cups would constantly be leaky
We'd wait a long time to get the checks
Now, the two of us are the patient kind, and we understand that when a restaurant gets busy it's just part of the norm
But last night definitely goes down in our book as the worse service ever
Aside from us two, there was only a party of 4 in the restaurant
You'd figure with two wait staff on hand, and 6 patrons in total, you'd get served rather quickly
Oh how wrong we were! We ordered one appetizer, one hot entree and two rolls
My friend's hot entree came out before my two rolls, and I had wait an additional 20 minutes to receive my two rolls
When I asked the waiter when my two rolls will be coming he automatically said 'five minutes' without even checking with the sushi counter
10 minutes later, I had to ask again, and was given the answer 'it's on its way
' When I reasoned with them that my dining partner already received her hot entree and was halfway done eating, and all I ordered was two rolls, the wait staff finally got the idea that maybe they should be trying to get me my order
And let me say that the sushi chef was rather annoyed when the wait staff asked about my order
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you do your job!   The icing on the cake was when we asked for the check
The waiter goes 'sure' and walks to the front
10 minutes later he walks to the back of the restaurant and starts chatting with the waitress and totally forgot our request
It's a shame that this place has fallen so far
It seems as though management has changed hands and the new owners could care less about the patrons that dine there
My friend and I left the place feeling very frustrated
For those who aren't too willing to venture out into the city or neighboring boroughs for more sushi variety, GoWasabi offers its own unique variety of Japanese and Korean culinary treats
The sushi isn't bad, a bit expensive for how small the portions are
From what I know, they are one of the few places that has brown rice as an option for sushi
Some of the Korean dishes (Bi Bin Bab, Bulgolgi) are definitely decent
The ambience is great -- excellent lighting, space, and lively with the piano jazz during the weekends
Finally, the service is excellent and worth mentioning
They are accomodating and very helpful in describing the menu while providing excellent service
Great service as always
The servers are more than willing to help, and the hostesses are super accommodating! We were asked how everything was and if we needed anything else throughout the dinner
Sushi was tasty and creative, and the sake and beer is affordably priced
I would highly recommend anyone in Queens looking for a great sushi experience to head over to GoWasabi on Ditmars
P

Great live jazz pianist on the weekend nights
Gowasabi is one of the finest Japanese restaurants in New York
The Sushi is the best I've ever eaten
The atmosphere is excellent and the staff is great
I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion!
I've only been to the restaurant on 30th, but the food is great
I love the greeting at the door by the whole staff, and the service is good

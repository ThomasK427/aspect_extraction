Tom the bartender is awesome and is always good with the buybacks
Try the Remedy Martini
its tropical goodness!
I don't normally write reviews for places that i frequent but i had to make an exception for uptown
i moved to this area afew months ago and i love this place
its very easy to become a regular here
the entire staff is friendly, even the owner will make an appearance to make sure everyone is having a good time
the best part about the place is the food
i've eaten here a bunch and i am always amazed at how good my entrees are
they are even beginning to put out some interesting specials too
Give it a try, you can't go wrong
I am a patron of the Uptown Lounge on a regular basis
I also recently had my husbands birthday party there ( I posted a review but it did not show) I read the previous review about the door man and how the guest did not like being carded
I can not think of a nicer restaurant with a great bar scene anywhere on the Upper East Side
Could this be because the doorman keeps the riff raff, drunks, and youngsters out? I have gone there on the weekends, been asked for id (thanks it is a complement) and had a great time
Food is superb, service is flawless, and the crowd is great (nice, respectable, and friendly)  Management, do not change your policies on the weekend, it is the only nice upscale place to visit!
I live in the neighborhood and thought Uptown was a nice restaurant
Imagine my disappointment when I arrived with my parents (in their 60's) and two friends and we were harrassed at the door by a surly, power-hungry bouncer! I was tremendously embarrassed and my parents, from out-of-town, just couldn't believe it
I said something to our nice waitress and she said a large party had complained the night before about similar treatment
Nice restaurants do not have a rude bouncer out front harrassing diners for IDs
I will not return and will encourage my friends not to patronize Uptown until it learns to treat its diners with respect
After living on the UES for the last five years, I have been a huge fan of Uptown
If you have not been here, this is what you can expect (and some tips)
Great food (try the duck breast or bass), huge portions (order 1 salad to share), a great staff (actually nice genuine people), plenty of options (tons of wines by the glass, martinis, beer, apps), and probably the most fun upbeat atmosphere nore of 14th street
The place is spacious, beautifully decorated, open and the crowd is classy yet not snobby
It can get noisy at the bar section, so if you are on a date or special occassion, sit in the dining area or their back private room
The outside seating is great to people watch and you are never rushed out
The only negative is sometimes it is too busy and you can wait a little awhile for a table (call ahead, they honor all reservations)
They also should offer some vegetarian options on the menu
I have hosted two events for my company ,Blackstone Mangement, here and both my co-workers and clients were impressed
The service is equal to that of 5 star places, they actually appreciate your patronage
This is a real find, especially on the upper east side
All the best and continued success- Marshall B
This place has great food and they deliver late! Unfortunately every time I have ordered they have mixed up or left out dishes in my order
It has happened consecutively, 3 times already
Im writing this because i'm so mad i can't order from them and have to settle for something else
I had the filet mignon which was great quality and cooked in a very tasty sauce
I paired it with a nice Pinot Noir and it was a perfect meal
Good ambience
On the Sat
night I was there they played 80's music which was fun
The female:male ratio was 3:1 - better for the guys
What a unique find on the UES! Uptown Lounge is trendy and chic yet reasonably priced
The martinis and appetizers are great perfect for happy hour since the drinks are only $6 from 5-8pm
My fianc and I never frequent the same restaurant twice, but we keep going back!
We just wanted to thank all the staff and managers at Uptown Restaurant
Our engagement party was absolutly perfect
The space skylight room was beautiful and all the guests had a great time
Everyone commented on how good the food was and how attentive the staff was
We live in the area and you will see us again!  Many thanks- Jon Jill L
My friend and I have been to Uptown tons of times for drinks and appetizers
It is the nicest place on the UES and we always have a great experience
We went to dinner at Uptown last Thurs evening with another couple
We sat towards the back area behind the fancy curtains
We ordered our appetizers and entrees
I must say, I was completely taken back
I knew they had great bar food, but the dining experience was superb
The meals were first rate (and reasonably priced) and we had a very enjoyable evening
Our waitress, Laura, was very attentive and was a pleasure
Food, ambience, drinks: on a score of 1 to 10 (best), this place is a solid 9
We will definitely be back!
Saw the great reviews on this site so I thought I'd take a chance
Was by myself so I ate at the bar
The bartender, Marta, was very friendly
Ordered the so called baby back ribs
Don't think they were babybacks because they were large ribs
Just drenched in bbq sauce and came out cold
Marta apologized profusely and bought my drink to compensate
A classy move which I appreciated
A nice looking place and a good singles scene though
Great place for a hungover brunch
$15 includes 2 drinks (bloody marys or mamosas) and your meal
Portion sizes are big and filling
I would recommend the banana stuffed French toast if you're going for breakfast or the chicken sandwich if you want lunch
Sit in the back because that is where there is the most light
As an UES resident who frequently goes downtown for dinner and entertainment, I must say that it is great to have such a wonderful restaurant with-in walking distance
The dishes here are delicious and very reasonable
The place is usually very busy and they have turned into quite the nighttime spot
I made an effort to speak to the owner, manager and chef to let them know how great of a job they are doing If you stop by here, take notice to the family feel of the place
Service is very warm and inviting
They change the menu every season, offer unique and tasty drinks and overall just a pleasure to be there
P
S- try their dumplings or goat cheese stuffed mushrooms
For entrees, try the tuna w/ ginger or the grilled shrimp
I am the managing director for the midtown office of Bear Sterns
I also frequent Uptown Restaurant for dinner and drinks
I am always impressed by the service, quality of food, ambience, and the charming nature of this place
Even though the location is further then we usually go, I decided to have our tier office party at Uptown's Skylight Room
I was beyond impressed
Granted this is not the Plaza, but it was one of the most successful and fun holiday parties we have attended
Delicious appetizers entrees, beautiful room, and the staff was extraordinary
John KT, you both coordinated an excellent party and I will continue to have both my personal events and corporate functions at your establishment
Thank you again and Happy New Year

I live across the street and love this place so much I have been there the last 3 Tues nights
The service is spectacular, the scene is classy but laid back, the live jazz on tuesday is an added perk
The place is underated likely bc of its location in the upper east
I adore the intimate setting and wonderful lighting
The 20 dollar wine bottles do not hurt (on Tues nights also)
I've only ever dined at Uptown and have always been extremely pleased with my experiences

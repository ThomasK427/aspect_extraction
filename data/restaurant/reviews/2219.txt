From the Maitre de, to the service, to the quality of the food
We even received a little jar of Patsy's sauce to take home!!
We dined at Patsy's on September 9, 2002 and also in July
Each time we had great food and service
The clams casino were the sweetest and the canneloni was the best I have ever had! I also had filet of sole arregenata and lobster arregenata
The escarole monacino with bread crumbs, olive oil, pinoni nuts, raisins and olives was sensational! Service is warm and professional
The memory of Sinatra is strong here which makes it more fun! Bravo to the Scognamillo family!!
This is a must eat at restaurant especially if you are bringing out of towners looking for a quintessential NYC experience
Patsy's friendly staff ownership will regale you with stories about when Sinatra used to eat here or when the World Champ 60's Yankees teams would come in en masse - - You still will get an occasional star siting here with reports of Tony Bennett, Jennifer Lopez, and others  The food is old school and outstanding - my preference is for the penne dishes with a taste of italian sausage on the side
try anything that looks good - it is all excellent
There are few words to describe the chicken alfredo
Bon!!!
the pizza is totally delicious along with every other dishes
Talk about great food! This place is the real deal in Italian cooking
A classy many-star restaurant, Patsy's is a place to take someone who wants a little history with their pasta
Patsy's sauces are to die for (and are conveniently sold by the jar if you so desire); they're dishes are amazing (try the Stuffed Calamari) and the service is everything you would expect of a place that has regularly catered to the likes of Frank Sinatra
Yeah, it's pricey, but worth it
That's why you went there in the first place
The place is now 50 years old, and the decore is quite possibly original (read: decore is a little bit quaint)
The servers hop
However, any place that has 50 years of staying power in NYC has got to be good, and this place is no exception
For a meal that is not rushed, and an atmosphere that is nice (not trendy), I would highly recommend this wonderful place (I am under 30 and really enjoyed it)
The price is very fair for what you get
If you are a connoiseur of authentic Caesar Salad then it doesn't get any better than this
They make it tableside from scratch and will add Chicken Paillard, Grilled Shrimp or Broiled Salman flaked if you are trying to keep with the Atkins diet
You do have to tell them to keep the bread away though---they make it all on premise and have these dinner rolls with mozzarella cheese inside that are addictive
Only place I ever was offered Chammomile Grappa after dinner
The food was very reasonable considering the quality of everything
Si my boyfriend and I made a reservation for 8PM
We got there at 8 exactly and the hostess said all they had were small tables up front (how about HOLDING a reservation), though we could see a nice open one it the back
She said the wait would be 5 minutes
20 minutes later, we were seated at the table that had been open the whole time
OUr waiter was a little confused about how to serve champagne
HOwever, when the food came out, it was great!! I recommend the prosecuttio app and the shrimp entree, but the calamari and the penne were also quite good
Once you get over the huirdles of the bubling servers, the food is well worth it
Fontana di Trevi was a delight to dine at
Waitstaff were courteous and on the ball
No bombardment of dishes but careful anticipation of when you are done and ready for the next course, and then voila! it arrives! The frittura mista is the best I've had in years
calamari, zucchini, and more
it was a great experience and i would recommend it for a wonderful dinner before a show at carnegie hall
While the entree was good, our salad was terrible
the wait staff kept mixing up who ordered what and we were rushed out
I just found Sushiya as I work in the area and I have to say that I love it
The fish is fresh and the rolls are great
They cook their rice perfectly and I especially like the spicy scallop roll and the shrimp tempura roll
The house salad and the shumai are also tasty
This place is great for lunch and dinner although the location is harder for diners
I think they do a wonderful job and I will always eat sushi here when in the neighborhood
but i also go when i'm in the neighborhood on weekends
most of the japanese businessmen go to the noodle ramen shop a few stores down
nothing extraordinary about sushiya
it's a typical japanese restaurant
it's not nobu but they aren't trying to be
my favorite dish is the don katsu
it's always juicy, crispy, and there always enough of it
it's awesome with an ice cold japanese beer
decor is pale wood that's requisite for a sushi place
service is fine, yes they don't always speak english but they usually understand what you're trying to say
Eh, not a great place to eat
The decor is friendly and the lighting is good, but for a 17 dollar plate of terayaki they are NOTHING SPECIAL
The service was horrible, we NEVER saw our waitress and when we did she couldn't speak english
The food is too pricey for what is given to the customer
I disagree that this is deli-style
While it certainly is not a top-tier sushi bar, it is a very fresh and good value for the price
I do agree that it is an ideal place for the busy mid-towner to do lunch
Services is snappy - although not always friendly (waiters) but the Sushi chefs are very nice and willing to explain dishes to the newbie
I like it here
Mid-town has wonderful Japanese restaurants, levels above Sushiya, but for when you can't expense it, Sushiya is a safe, pleasant, good value
I've been coming to Sushiya since 2000 and count on them for fresh, affordable sushi, a fair selection of sake and friendly service
The decor is typical Japanese simplicity, there are lots of rolls to choose from as well as generous cuts of sashimi
This is sushi smack in the middle of midtown for all the businessmen and middle managers to take their lunches
As someone who knows what real sushi tastes like, this is very mediocre, deli-level sushi just dressed up a little bit more
There are never any Japanese businessmen in here which says a lot
This place is great, I've been coming here for years and it is always delicious
The menu is huge and contains every type of Chinese food imaginable
delivery is efficient
The ambiance isn't the best, the restaurant could be a little dimmer, but the food's awesome and it's pretty affordable, especially for Midtown
the prices are decent
the food is cooked well although it doesn't really distinguish itself from other chinese i have had here
the waiter seemed to want to be doing anything other than working at the time
alas, the japanese menu isn't available for lunch and sadly that is what i was looking for when i walked in the door
food was really good
but i just dint like service
I've been coming here for years, and bring all my out of town guests here, and everyone loves this place
The food is fantastic, the service is personal and friendly, the prices great
I just can't say enough good things about this restaurant
I dream about the eggplant appetizer
It's not a scene, it's a place to come when you care about the FOOD! All the food is excellent, with my favorites being the lamb kofte kebabs and the vegetarian combo
The perfect finish to this meal is pistachio pudding and a happy tea
The happy tea must work, because everyone leaves this restaurant in a great mood!
Ariana was absolutely phenomenal
The food tasted like home made, traditional afghan meals and Rafi was an entertaining and prompt host
The price was moderate and the portions were a good size
I lived next door to this place for two years
I have moved from NYC and I truly miss the food and service at Ariana
Wali (?) was the waiter/mgr and made every visit a pleasure
The place is small but well worth the visit
Good prices
No wait, close to Radio City Music Hall
The food was really good here, however expect to pay $8

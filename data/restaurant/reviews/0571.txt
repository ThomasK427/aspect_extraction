Cool is an invisible currency meant to put others back into the corn fields from which they came and Elmo is the bank of Cool du jour
So if you like hollow conversation, empty sex, and window shopping, Elmo is the Hall Of Mirrors you've been looking for in a restaurant
Was walking in the nabe one Saturday stumbled upon Elmo
Looked cool from outside so we thought we'd check it out
Glad we did! The food was good but it was the decor that really did it for me
Love the mosaics
The tables are really close, but that just meant we got to chat with the people beside us they told us what to do while we were in the city
Beautiful setting,, good looking people,, but are you willing to pay premium for a chicken leg for US$26? So I guess its ok,,
This place is pretty lousy
I saw some good reviews about elmo posted here, but I am sure they were written by the nasty servants of this restaurant
I brought friends here and was completely embarassed, the food was awful, the service non-existant (I guess they were all filling out the citysearch review form trying to trick more unsuspecting people into this trap)
Maybe the staff of Elmo will read this and instead of posting a lame review they will do something to correct the problems, otherwise you wont have anything left to review
LISTEN TO AN HONEST IMPARTIAL OPINION; this place is not worth the effort you will have to make to have a halfway ok time
Go someplace else!
The meat loaf was as dry as a hockey puck, the fried chicken was flavorless but greasy, the spareribs were dry but the glaze was tangy, The only dish that was good was the calamari but the ketchup / cocktail sauce could be improved
The mash potatoes and vegtables were nicely prepared
Service was competent but they need to turn down the music
Good food - the split pea soup was delicious and filling - and a fun atmosphere make Elmo a great place to hit for a hip, casual NY dinner
Thumbs-up for a courteous, grounded host at a trendy spot
Bravo elmo! From the time I called to get the address through paying the check and walking out of the front door the experience was all that a restaurant should offer
Friendly, informed staff, good food at good prices and portions, fun atmosphere and a truly diverse crowd
Elmo offers the New York every transplant and native alike desires
When my date took me their last weekend we witnessed the following
a gorgeous drag queen making her way through the crowd saying hello to the local gays in a truly Miss America style, while a middle-aged pre-theatre couple was receiving their entrees and the group of young upper-east-side girls took a smoke break at the bar in between their appetizers and entrees
Bravo elmo! The owners of elmo should write a guide book for the next potential hot spot owners on the block
After reading some of the reviews I was a bit skeptical about eating at Elmo
However, my meal was delicious, seating was more than comfortable, service was excellent and the bill was totally reasonable
From someone who eats in tons of NYC restaurants I would highly recommend trying it out
elmo's staff is exactly what I moved to New York for - a diverse, ecclectic and interesting ethnic mix of cool, hip, young individually and uniquely handsome and spirited folk who serve with grace, ease and a sense of humor
And the food is delicious - especially the roasted lamb with honey grilled root vegtables and the fresh homemade coconut layer cake
I always have a great time when I visit elmo, and think my experience is always a fair value
What a welcome newcomer to the hyped world of restaurants
elmo's just good ole genuine New York fun!
What a pleasant surprise to find a fierce hot spot with a full crowd every night still manages to be NICE!!! Food's great, fried chicken and coconut layer cake (I got that in before the new year's resolution
) Seared salmon and a lemon tart will be my pick after January 1st
Really though, you know how pretentious the new kid on the chelsea block can be but not my new favorite ELMO
The staff was so much fun and actually seemed to enjoy being there as much as their customers
Go, Go, Go, to elmo!
Simply the coolest place in NYC
I would have been happy even if the food had sucked
which it didn't
Get the meatloaf! Rockin and juicy and perfect! Though have to say the people were beyond pretty and a little intimidating but superb eyecandy and saw Deniro there
how cool is that?
I met a friend at Elmo for dinner while I was visiting New York and I was very impressed! The food was great and at a reasonable price
I loved the atmosphere and the service was great too
Elmo was overall a good place
We went at a good time and it was not to crowded
Service was attentive and the mac and cheese rivals Cafeteria's
It has a crispy top and three different cheeses
As if there wasnt enough cheese in Chelsea!! No complaints about the Steak either very nice reduction sauce served with it
Considering its location it is a good find
Very dispointing, to say the least
I felt like I was on a cattle truck, way too crowded, all that was needed was a cattle prod
I had been here before and was not impressed but I gave it another chance and I will not be going back
Lousy food, pushy service (when you can find you waiter) and a crowd of bridge and tunnel folks hoping for a good time
You can do better
Surprise, surprise
Some friends asked me to go here (they like it cause they have a kid in a stroller and the place is roomy
) My friends parenting issues aside, I was not looking forward to going after reading a couple of reviews on this site however it was nice
Great mix of people (staff included) friendly, and the food tasty
Wine list has a nice range and some good inexpensive bottles
My office is near the restaurant and I have made it a regular haunt
Great for clients or friends
Food was good to start and has only improved
Bright and spacious for lunch or brunch and a bit glamorous in the eve what more could you want? You might expect attitude from the sexy staff but they've all been friendly, even on crazy busy nights
Don't stop at the lamb shank, take it all the way home with the coconut cake
No No No No! Really BAD food and lousy service
There are many other places to go in the area, don't embarass yourself by picking Elmo, your friends will never let you live it down!
Our expereince here was terrible
The food was substandard, wine list bad and the waitstaff and manager were beyond terrible, they were rude and dismissive
Not the place to go and spend YOUR hard earned dollars
The atmosphere was great, very south beach, nouveau, blue-ish tinge to everything
The service was horrible, the worst I've had in years - and the food was over cooked and over dressed
I won't be going back!
With so many better restaurants in NY, don't even bother with this mediocre (at best) one
The food is so-so (the meatloaf is so bad!!!)
The service is marginal
We had to wait over an hour for our table after we were told that it would be ready in 15-20 minutes
The hostess told us it was OUR fault because we didn't make reservations
Well, then tell us it will be an hour and don't lie to us!!! Our server was nice, but she was too busy to be attentive to our table
We waited 15 minutes for her to even acknowledge us
Overall, not a good experience
The only nice thing I can say about Elmo, is that the decor is nice and their cocktails are good
Maybe a good place to meet up for drinks, but I would strongly recommend not eating there
I had a group of friends here on a Saturday night, and we were running 20 minutes late
We didn't get the normal New York hassle, our table was still set up and ready, and everyone from the hostesses to the bartenders to the waiters and waitresses were very nice and funny! The food was great-- a twist on comfort foods that we all love-- try the mac and cheese, or the cheesey bread
The drinks were fabulous too-- yummy Cosmos, Mojitos, and Raspberry lemonade! I recommend this place to anyone who's out to have a good time-- good music, good food, good vibes
The space is funky, the people are pretty and the food isn't all that bad
The vegetarian selections are quite good: the soba noodles w/cashes and tofu was just the right side, and not too salty
The mac and cheese is delightful
The salads are all light and good
But no breadbasket? The Duncan Hines cake was on the small side, but good anyway
The waitstaff was friendly and attentive
My favorite restaurant in Chelsea
Great room although it is incredibly noisy and not from the crowds but from the street noise
Funky decor, laid back service, and good food
Go for the comfort food like pan roasted chicken and mashed potatoes
Inedible old shrimp, 1/2 hour wait for dried-out overcooked meatloaf, disappearing waiter, manager more concerned about money than clientele - my worst dining experience in New York
This restaurant is chic but not uninviting
The decor is of the absolutely fabulous type of which Edina and Patsy would surely approve

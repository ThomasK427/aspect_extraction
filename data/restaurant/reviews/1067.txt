She came to the table and asked us if it was ok to be late on the water? Every time she brought drinks to the table I thought she was going to spill them all over the place
When the food finally came an hour later she began tossing plates onto the table and dumped a bowl of cole slaw into my lap
We then find out that two people in my party had no food
She never put their order in
Not very good drinks
The lemonades taste like lemon juice in water
I couldn't wait to get out of there
If you have to go, order beer and drink your face off
Maybe then you will only see the pretty girls and not notice the bad service
We've done Earl's twice for Friday lunch, and I, for one, has returned quite satisfied
From Earl's, you can count on enormous servings of above-average grub and a good time
The Big-D Burger ($11), which is complemented by terrific fries, is a downright gluttonous experience, and all salads ($8-12) have drawn favorable reviews
The environment is a touch loud (although the music's good), but the walls sport nifty vintage items, from license plates to pennants to movie posters
The waitstaff, while generally good-looking, is painfully slow either getting to you, giving you your food, or giving you the bill (it depends)
All things considered, Earl's is a good spot
NOTHING BUT HOME COOKIN FOOD
GREAT HURRICANES! FAST SERVICE AND EASY GOING ATMOSPHERE
NO FRILLS, JUST GOOD FOOD WITH GOOD COMPANY!
good food and reasonable prices, can get a little loud and the service can be alittle out to lunch but they sure are cute, so who cares!  Great cocktails, feels like a roadhouse from the south
My waitress was AWESOME!!! She was so funny and HOT!!! We had to wait a while for our food but Cassi made it worth the wait
I LOVE CASSI!!! The music was good also
If you are into the Dead and BBQ this place rocks!!
The Scene The long, slender room is split length-wise, with banquette-backed tables hidden behind Japanese linen curtains on the left, and a svelte, polished wood bar spanning to the right
Servers are warm and very attentive, gladly describing dishes and offering smart menu suggestions
The Food Owned and overseen by Masa Takayama, whose famously expensive sushi bar next door keeps the food world aflutter, this, his more casual, drop-in, and comparably less expensive offshoot, still sets the bar pretty high
Smart diners will begin with a few pieces of sashimi, as the fish here is some of the most pristine and fresh in the city
Menu items are familiar, yet many, like yakisoba with Kobe-style beef, feature high-end ingredients (and price tags)
The tempura is light and excellent, and other small dishes--including squid jerky and chicken skewers--are affordable and fun for sharing
Went here about a week ago and had a great time
It was a Friday night around 7pm and we were seated immediately--next to Lance Armstrong and his rather loud group of friends who spent most of the night checking their blackberries
Overall, The food was delicious and the drinks were above average
The beef was incredibly tender, the foie gras sauteed to perfection and the sushi rolls were HUGE
With about 5 dishes ordered and drinks, the bill came to just under $200
I'll definitely be back very soon
Have to make up for past reviews complaints that sushi was too small
It's supposed to be small, not so big you can't eat it with one bite
It's also wonderful here at Bar Masa: fresh, expertly cut fish, perfect, delicate rice
Combining truffles, sushi and caviar, if not groundbreaking, is still heavenly and ingenious
Everything we had did not disappoint from the cocktails, to the sushi canape appetizer, to sushi a la carte (toro is excellent), entrees (the cod rivals nobu's, the uni truffle risotto is to die for) dessert
the green tea layered crepe cake is phenomenal
Don't come in expecting an out of this world experience like you would at Masa
It is just straight up good food from the people next door who bring you the best and most expensive sushi in the city, a bit simplified, restrained, and less costly
Just a bit
The pieces of sushi were about a quarter of the size of other sushi places, and priced about 4 times as much
The bar area was really cool, but the drinks were also ridiculously overpriced
The sushi tasting was almost $70, and a glass of wine runs about $20 per glass
PLUS, I left hungry
I'll never come back here again
The fish is from the same kitchen as Masa's proper
Bartender Katie made the BEST manhattans ever
Food was extremely high quality
Can't wait to try their sushi/sashimi tasting!!
I went here after work on a Thursday to meet some friends for drinks and had a fabulous time! Mike V is the best bartender ever
The drinks at Bar Masa rank among the creative cocktails of Milk and Honey and Angel's Share
We grabbed seats at the bar and watched as Mike made some amazing drinks, including those listed on the menu as well as new creations, all using the fresh ingredients displayed on the bar
The uni risotto with black truffles was probably the single most delicious dish I can ever recall eating
For any fans of uni, it is definitely a must try and worth a visit just to try this incredible creation
The lobster risotto is also excellent
The green tea cake was one of the best desserts I have ever eaten
Rich green tea custard between crepe like cake layers
It was absolutely phenomenal
Bar Masa's sushi is overall excellent though did not stand out when compared to other high end sushi restaurants in NYC
Bar Masa's cooked dishes are what makes this restaurant stand out from the crowd of high end sushi restaurants in NYC
For all of the great reviews Bar Masa was not worth it at all
The sushi pieces were small everything was completly overpriced
There are so many great sushi places in the City - go there
Additionally, I was there for my birthday and they did nothing to make it special
The sushi and sashimi at Bar Masa is very fresh and tasty -- the toro sashimi melts in your mouth and they have some fun fusion sushi creations that are worth a try
The green tea crepe for dessert was decadent
But watch out for the Yuzu Martini! It is delicious, but was WAY potent and both my friend and I felt like we had had 5 martinis after just one, I almost felt like I had been drugged after, so beware, it's a serious drink! Go for a cocktail and to share a couple plates but be prepared -- even for a little treat, it's quite expensive for what you get
Extremely overpriced for a venue that lacks both ambiance and service
Sushi was mediocre at best
Tasting platter was insanely small and ridiculously overpriced
Waste of time money

The Scene The open-mall seating overlooks an expansive wall of windows with a Columbus Circle view and manages to feel removed from the humming escalators and J
Crew shoppers
A bustling crew of sage green-shirted servers whisk plates of luncheon and light dinner favorites to power lunchers, tourists, and ladies who lunch
The Food Fresh baked bread, impeccably brewed iced tea: These sort of details make dining a pleasure despite the relative simplicity of the offerings
Among the sandwiches, the tartine of roast pork tonnato impresses with a delicate balance of tuna aioli, pickled red onion and capers, while the roast turkey served on a lovely Palladin bread could use a touch more brie
Quiche of the day astounds with its unusually creamy, custard-like interior and flaky shell, and salads arrive lightly dressed with fresh-from-the-farm ingredients
Do save room for desserts; in particular, the tarts of the day look and taste like mini works of art
Perhaps my expectations were to blame, but mediocrity is even more offensive when the arrival of this place is so anticipated and the prices are so, well, proud
My wife and I ordered the tuna and pork sandwiches respectively, along with the TKO (thomas keller oreo, acronymed so as not to get the keebler elfen lawyers upset), and a bowl of barscht
I'm Polish so the barscht had to wow me, and it was pretty darn good
The sandwiches were just plain ordinary
I will not do this again
Came here for my birthday bruch with 4 friends
The service was great
Food excellent
Had the special duck confit sandwich and it was tasty
Friends orders the soup, quiche and salad
They were all superb
The special pistachio nut with marmalade and creme brulee tart was great
Chococlate ganache cake was not served warm and somewhat on the more bitter side
White chocolate dome was ok
But will definitely return for more sandwiches, roast beef, and the quiches
Bouchon is for the ladies who lunch set, with a few tourists sprinkled in for good measure
At the counter, my 145-pound frame was squeezed between two large women trying to daintily stuff down their lunches without touching the person on either side -- a challenge indeed
Bouchon is plopped into the suburban mall in this very urban location, with a view out the immense window onto Columbus Circle that is truly impressive

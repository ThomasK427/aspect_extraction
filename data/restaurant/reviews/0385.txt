We had a great time! Delicious and delicate taste Tapas
Stylish and romantic ambience with red brick walls and water reflecting candle light
Friendly staff, proper and prompt service
We ordered the tasting menu
Scallops: half the party didnt eat them
I thought it was good but the preparation was boring
celery-root soup: Tasty but lukewarm
needed to be hotter
didnt even melt the manchego cheese in the soup
Mahi-Mahi: Tasted like salmon with barbecue sauce
Boring
Hangar Steak: not good
very gamey
two people thought it was lamb
poorly paired with a cheesy potato
apple sorbet: The highlight
Olive-oil cake: Tasted like a piece of yellow cake you could get prepackaged at a supermarket
Service
a little rude but adequate
20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more is ballsy
I spend a lot of money on food, often at restaraunts more expensive than this
With so many great restaraunts in this city, I dont understand why you would spend money here
Its not bad, its just too expensive for mediocrity
I guess you pay for the river
I wanted to take a girl here for a third but important date (speical occasion)
I was hesitant after reading reviews, but relieved when everything went well
I had requested grotto seating, and was told when I got there it was not available
I asked if I could wait longer for a table on the Grotto to open up, which is what I did
I thought the service was very good
The food is definitely not as high quality as the ambiance is (or as the prices would suggest)
However, in situations like mine, where ambiance was more important than the food, it was great
As far as the ambiance, it is very romantic and hip/cool, except after 10 it's too noisy if you're looking for a quiet, serious occasion
If you're trying to impress a girl and have a lot of fun in doing so, this is the place
I just went to Suba to celebrate my bday
I did it on Sunday - when they have their flamenco show
We had an AMAZING time!! From the entertainment, to the food, to the attentive service, I was very impressed!! You have several options for dinner, eigther a $55 prefix - 5 course dinner, or individual ordering
We had 7 people, we each had an appetizer, a main course, dessert, and 2 bottles of red wine - and we spent around $500
So i dont think thats TOO bad
The portions are not HUGE, but you are very full by the end of your meal
The flamenco show is at around 8:30-9:45
This gives you plenty of opprotunity to talk, and at the same enjoy your meal, and watch the enterntainment
Very sensual, amazing ambiance, great DATE place!!!
Rude management, started to charge a cover, overpriced drinks
Too bad, the place itself is really nice and the music is good
But waiting at the door when we can see inside, and see it is empty is stupid
The manager tried to tell us we had to buy a bottle to get into the basement -puh-leez!
My husband and I had a blast
We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor
The music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb drinks
Everyone well-dressed and it was a small scene
We loved it and will go back!
We dined at Suba's grotto room on our anniversary, and we mostly loved it
Water reflections from the moat shimmering on the walls create a cozy atmosphere
All the waiters were very polite and we didn't experience any rudeness like in the posts below
Just one thing was a bit annoying - the waiters kept circling our table each minute, checking if our plates were cleaned yet
It felt invasive
Food: I had seafood lasagna (delicious!) and hangar steak (very good), and my wife had seared scallops (tasty!) and sesame-crusted tuna
Tuna was so-so - we both expected it to be tastier
It tastes better in many restaurants at half the price of Suba
For deserts, I had honey panna cote (amazing!!!) and my wife had fried banuelos (average)
Overall, we'd come back here once their menus chance a bit
It's definitely a good culinary and romantic experience
Seems like most of the negative comments are from people who came to party, not to dine
And maybe that's the problem
This is a place for serious food and wine (take a long look at the wine list, with verticals of Unico going for hundreds of dollars)
If that's what you're looking for, you will not be disappointed, by the food, the wine or the staff who are knowledgable, polite, welcoming and helpful (okay, the folks at the door can sometimes be a bit bluff)
As for Romantic, depends on when you go--if the place is full of partyers, then it can get loud and change the atmosphere somewhat
I have to say that I'm not happy with Suba anymore
Though I was a regular for over a year, they never remember me and always harrass our group for wanting to enter
I reminded the bouncers that I was a regular and they never care
I talked to a nasty manager who made me feel like I was unappreciated
He was mean and it added to my disappointment
Suba used to be cool, and fun
Now it's all annoying door and bad service
Service comes from the people working, not the place
Suba used to be cool because the people used to be cool
(The bartenders in particular are seriously bad, what happened to my mojito? It's horrible now
) This is the beginning of the end of Suba
I will not go back
It's only a matter of time


I decided to throw a get-together here two Saturdays ago I've never had a more miserable experience in a NY bar
We had a late dinner there even purchased a bottle of wine
As the meal was ending, the French manager told us that we couldn't linger around because the table was blocking the stair entrance to the downstairs grotto
As if we weren't insulted enough, I went outside to place a phonecall because it was too loud inside
Well, the bouncer (who has got to be the worst power-tripper alive) wouldn't let me back inside even after I explained that I went outside to place a call
So, I actually had to stand outside wait for a friend to alert the manager
The manager had the audacity to actually offer his business card for the future
Is he kidding? Suba is more like Su-BAD
I had been meaning to go to Suba for a while, but kept having to cancel my reservations, but last night I met a friend there for drinks at the bar
Well, we ended up staying for tapas and food upstairs in the bar
It was amazing!!! The service was really good
Our waiter was super nice and he recommended some great dishes (the chicken empanadas!!!) The prices are affordable too, so eventhough I felt like I went out to an attentive, sexy restaurant, I didn't spend too much money
I still want to eat downstairs sometime, but I'll probably be back to the tapas area sooner
I like the place except for the service
soooooooooo rude!!!!!
loved the romanticism on the middle room with the water, but needs to be changed!!!!, liked the music, but hated the fact of being waiting after eaten there to go to the dancing room downstairs, very bad for the manager
As a Latin American I am ashamed! I never saw such a cheap way to extract money from customers
We went there in a group and ordered several drinks

As soon as you walk in its like having moms two big arms wrapped around you
Emerse yourself in the red sauce and red cloths of Montes
Whether one pizza place is better than another is often very subjective
My personal favorite is Nick and Joe's
It's a basic pizza joint, not much to look at, but the pizza is what I go for
The sauce is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy
The sauce may not be for everyone, since it is distintive
If you like a cleaner (more generic) flavor then other places may provide the norm
Likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then Nick and Joe's may not be your favorite
Don't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review
Like I said, Nick and Joe's may not be everyone's favorite, but it's mine
Find out for yourself!
Just went for the first time
Great tasting pizza - best slice in the area!
Nick Joe's is the worst pizza and worst food around
How they are still in business is beyond me
Really and truly awful
don't bother
Finally went to the renovated PJ Hanley's, happened to be the day of the immigration rally and the kitchen was short-staffed
Menu was limited to pizza which was excellent - thin crust, fresh ingredients, very tasty
While no one can top Grimadi's for best pie in Brooklyn, PJ's have a legitimate claim to best pizza in Carroll Gardens
Occasionally, Toni I go to Court Street for dinner on Friday nights
My family loved the old Hanley's and we went to the new Hanley's for my nephew's 21st Birthday
Beside them not having the seafood special, they did not have mozzerella for the appetizer
Once we did recieve our dinner, it was delicious
The wait person did not ask if we wanted another drink
They did however offer a birthday shot for the kid
They never asked if we wanted dessert or coffee
So we got the check and went to the bar
We would have spent alot more money if the waitress had been experienced
I guess she needs to learn sometime
In Short This small but busy restaurant is for sushi lovers on a budget who appreciate an all-you-can-eat sushi deal
Don't be shy, but keep in mind, whatever you don't finish you pay for
The list of offerings is heavy on the usual suspects, including tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, and eel
You'll also see a few offbeat numbers like scallops and mackerel
my brother i came hungry last night and very eager to try their all-you-can-eat sushi special ($18pp)
the variety of fish wasnt bad and all the usual suspects (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, squid, octopus, etc) were present
fish was fresh enough, but the quality was only so-so (the salmon was especially sinewy)
you could also get any of the nigiri sushi as either a maki or a handroll
out of the handrolls, the yuka (salmon, salmon roe, and cucumber) the crispy salmon skin were especially good
special house rolls could be ordered for an additional price
sushi is made fresh to order, and you can put in as many orders as you want, but we definitely noticed the lag time between our orders get longer and longer (sit at the sushi bar for faster service)
service was polite
restaurant was very crowded even on a weekday
LLOOVVE THIS PLACE
Food is excellent
Fish is so very fresh
Waitstaff are very friendly
Love YUKA
this is the first time i'm writing a review
i was too shocked with their all-you-can-eat sushi
the worst sushi i ever had in my whole life (i'm japanese)
no wonder i didn't see any japanese customers!
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality
limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish
the waitstaffs are nice though
wont come back again for sure!
The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo
The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance
Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art
I must give it Yon out of Yon stars! Taxan delicious! Arigato Gozimas Yuka!
Great value and great quality sushi
Can't ask for anything more
This is some really good, inexpensive sushi
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice
The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu
In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town
You absolutely cannot beat the all you can eat deal at this place
For under $20 you can pretty much stuff yourself silly for 2 hours
While the all you can eat peices are understandably smaller and more rice heavy the regular priced sushi is just divine
Fantastic eel and awesome rolls
The service is fast almost to a fault
Our food was coming out faster then we could eat, fantastic! Cozy atmosphere with paper cranes swaying from the ceiling
This place is small and it WILL get crowded come dinnertime so make sure to get here a little earlier then when you want to eat
Well on a friday or sat, i think this place should take reservations as it gets pretty busy
we had to wait 45 mins to eat, so we went to a bar up the street
sashimi was meh, salmon was good but the tuna was a little white and seemed like the day before as the flavor had faded
Rolls nothing special
Sandobe is a much better place
but then again, I may just be spoiled by their rolls
The waiting is horroble
We waited 45min to get a table for 3people
Thanks god food was delicious
At the same time service was bad
It seems like they want you to eat fast and leave
So, they can get new people
Over all,that is the cheapes place for sushi
Good luch
The folks at Yuka really do it right
When you first walk in, the sushi chefs give you are hearty irash-shaimase! The main dining area is pleasantly decorated with paper cranes
The waitresses, in kimonos, are authentically Japanese (except I think there's one Korean girl)
There is an oba-san (grandma) there that is particularly friendly
The all-you-can eat sushi is a deal, but the regular sushi is way better
You can't beat Yuka for it's amazing All You Can Eat sushi deal

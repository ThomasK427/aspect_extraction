The owner is Eastern European, not Spanish but has that friendly easy-going Euro way about him
The space is cramped it gets noisy as diners chatter over loud music
But the mood is fun decor warm welcoming
Don't leave without trying the goat cheese balls
Hot, creamy inside, crispy outside so flavorful
We also enjoyed the cod fish entree in white bean ragout the morroccan lamb
The skewered pork loin appetizer was nothing special
Still the host's hospitality and the rest of the meal more than made up for it!
This place is great, amosphere is very pleasant, and service very good
The food was very good too
Only thing to say, the gateau basque is not a gateau basque
I am from Bordeaux, and this place reminded me the cote basque
If you want to have a feel of this wonderful region, go to this place and have fun
Take a pitcher of sangria
Pleasant surprises are hard to come by in New York dining
Euzkadi is a glaring exception
This little, romantic, side-streety nook was almost empty at dinner prime-time but I am grateful that I popped in
The ambience, wine list and service are standard for New York
However, Euzkadi's food approaches sublime
CitySearch wrongfully indicts Euzkadi as Spanish
Yes, Basque is a region in Spain but classifying Euzkadi as Spanish would be tantamount to deeming Cajun food standard American fare
Perhaps I'm biased because the menu was overwhelmingly unique (I wanted to try everything) and a scrumptious change from NYC's ubiquitous Chinese, Italian, Mexican and Sushi establishments
A must-return in my book
Great Spanish food in a tiny, quaint restaurant
The food was great, especially the tapas although the portions are a little smaller than what I am normally accustomed to
Try the goat cheese, ham ravioli and croquettes; you might want to order double as you get two or three of each in one tapa
Although the restaurant was small it had a lot of spanish character: dark wood, abstract bull paintings on the ceiling, candle-lit atmosphere
Really cute place to go although I would avoid a conventional dining time as having more than 20 people in the restaurant really starts to get cramped
ended up here sort of accidentally on valentine's day - couldn't have been happier! we didn't have a reservation and the place was packed but were seated within 10 min
the food was excellent and very reasonable (if you're a cheese fan try the sampler, nicely balanced)
The wine list is very complementary and also reasonable
I wouldn't call the service attentive but definitely friendly and in line with the vibe of the place
good music (if a little loud) and just an overall nice feel
I'll definitely be back
I have been to Euzkadi several times before, but the treatment I received last friday has escalated it to my favorite neighborhood spot
Given how busy it always is, when I was running late on friday I thought for sure my reservation would be discarded
But all it took was a quick phone call, and my party of 6 was accomodated immediately when I arrived 30 minutes late! Not only was our tardiness a thing of the past, our waiter friendly and attentive, but the food was absolutely delicious
For the upcoming cold months, I would recommend Euzkadi to warm anyone
I was born in the Basque country so I had no expectations whatsoever regarding this place,but I've heard so much buzz about Euzkadi that I decided to check it out last week
I was really pleasantly surprised
The food was incredible,I had two tapas to start cockles with beans and raviolis and the trout wrapped in bacon that was the special of the day as a main cours
The place it self is very European,warm with great wibe and energy but unpretentious with beautifull decor,excellent wine list and they also play great music from all around world
They also have very,very cute stuff
I walked by this place many times and it is always has a vibrant energy, music, candles
I am really sold now that I had the white sangria and paella! Even the bread on the table was fresh, warm, tasty! A great spot for friends and very romantic date spot as well
Service was fabulous too!
Came on a Wednesday night without a reservation
We started talking with the bartender and ended up staying at the bar
We ordered tapas (try the fried goat cheese and the aguacate!) and shared the dorada
The place was busy and had a bohemian feel
What really struck me were the regional cave paintings on the ceiling as dcor
However, it was the wine list that sold me
This place really impressed me!
I came here last Tuesday and was absolutely struck by the combination of food, atmosphere and service
It was obvious from the robust flavor of the food that only the highest quality of ingredients was selected
Upon entering the restaurant, the decor and live brazilian jazz playing in background transport you immediately from the city
And additionally, the service was polite, attentive and extremely knowledgable on the wines and food offered
Overall, me and my friends had a wonderful time there, and will definitely be back
Highly recommended!
Great food, great atmosphere, reasonable prices and VERY friendly and helpful wait staff
I highly recommend the ham and cheese croquettas, the fried goat cheese w/ honey and the sangria of course
I can't wait to go back
The food was delish, with a dark sexy ambiance that was really romantic
Too bad they turned off the jazz mid-meal and switched to loud obnoxious Eurotrash house music instead
Plus the waiter was never anywhere to be found, and we waited 20 min for the check and then another 15 to get our credit card swiped though the restaurant wasn't that busy - we probably would've had to wait longer if I hadn't said something to a manager
Food-wise, I highly recommend the paella and ham croquettas, and there was a great wine selection
I don't know if I'd return though
I don't like to spend my time while at dinner chasing someone down for service
The east village area certainly has no shortage of quality restaurants
I like this end of town alot to take out of towners out
Midtown is easy, this is interesting
Euzkadi is a reasonably priced small restaurant with a large assortment of delicious tapas and entree sized plates
There is something here for every palate
The only thing I missed was a tapas of grilled octopus, my personal fave
Solid choices of Spanish wines
It's a bit loud and dark on a Saturday night
But we'd return again
Even thought it is quite small, they had no problem handling 8 people at peak dinner hour
The place was really adorable - romantic and dark and small and rustic - like I was in France
The appetizers were great - particularly the dry sausage with chile chocolate on toast and the fried goat cheese in honey
The steak/fries was a perfect basic delicious dish (especially after a few glasses of wine) and the duck was fair
Definitely a super-cozy place, and if you go with a cutie, it's even better!
Went on a Sunday night, so waitress was quite attentive
The food is good, but nothing particularly amazing
Sangria is a MUST
Nice setting, great server, yummy desserts
The problem was the entree -- the pork chop was incredibly dry and tough
Definitely take a pass on this one and choose something else on the menu!
Recently enjoyed an easy Sunday evening @ Euzkadi
The food was fantastic and the staff was very accommodating
There was a DJ that successfully captured the mood a the perfect Sunday night out
easy, hip, and relaxed with brief moments of excitement
For those who want a great place with a great vibe
try it out
We had a reservation and waited an hour to sit down
The service was terrible
There were three in our party and our meals did not come all at once, one order was forgotten and another was completely wrong
Great atmosphere, friendly stuff and increadible DJ on Friday playing funky music from around the world
Great selection of wines and cheeses
Don't be surprised if you end up dancing on the table at the end of the night

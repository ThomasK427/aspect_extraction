We got very attentive services from the hostess
Food is average, I had the pork - it's kind of dry and the pork buns are worse than the ones in China Town
I do like the ambience of the restaurant, it's kind of trendy (in that neighbohood)
I won't recommend to go there for food
I used to proclaim Xing as my favourite restaurant in NYC
Considering I eat out almost every day, this was quite the statement
I ate there recently all excited about my chicken with cashews only to find they changed the menu that used to contain simple but incredibly tasty classic chinese dishes to yet another annoyingly pretentious fusion-eque menu with jacked up prices that can be found just about everywhere in the city
What was with the crispy chicken dish? I was so disappointed
I used to come here because I love reasonably priced chinese food but need the nice trendy ambience and doting service that cannot typically be found at other chinese restaurants in the city
This is a plea to the restaurant to PLEASE, for the love of God, bring back chicken with cashews
This used to be one of my all-time, no-fail favorites
It was reasonably priced, traditional Chinese food (like Crab Rangoon and General Tso's Chicken) served in a creative, updated way
I loved it! I was so disappointed when I saw the new menu
the prices are jacked up and they're serving lamb chops
?? Sorry, but it's off my list now
Shame
Have been a regular from day one
Was very pleased with food when Xing was Chinese
A little skeptical when I learned of the change
So impressed with the outcome
New Chef provides a very fresh and daring menu-not afraid to take chances
Also loved that staff was anxious to hear my feedback
Menu is seasonal-love that!!! All my old favorites still on the menu
New classics-oysters(best I've ever had), all fish dishes are great, love the lamb chops
The bar is a great scene
Sake selections are best in neighborhood
Desserts never disappoint
Love this place!!!!!
I live in the west side and stumbled upon Xing on my way to theatre
What an inviting place from the outside and the inside is truly wonderfully designed
I dine out quite often and go to the theatre quite often and Xing just gave me a destination before Theatre
Foie Gras was wonderfully done with a blueberry sauce if only they had a sauterne to go with it
The wine list featured about fifty wines all moderately priced
Our entrees included a Galangal crusted Black cod over chinese broccoli, and a tea smoked pork chops that was the most tender pork chops I've ever tasted
The meal was ended with a wonderful deep fried bananas with a ginger chocolate dipping sauce
The bill came to $150 when a similar dinner at Esca came to $400
Wow the last reviewer hit it dead on, I am relieved it wasn't just me
I live in the area and used to go there a few times a month for great upscale chinese
I went last night and was shocked once I got the menu
95% of the old dishes are gone, replaced by a rather lame attempt to be a trendy fusion restaurant, like manhattan needed another one of those
I'll say the food was a little better than the previous reviewer, but I was severely dissapointed that the old Xing was gone
The new chef really wanted to distance himself from chinese food and establish himself by throwing cod and truffle sauce and other things on his menu that are done much better elsewhere
BOOOOOO!!
I used to be a big fan of Xing when it was the restaurant described here - but as of January, it's completely changed
The old menu items are gone, except for the rib appetizer, which is now bland and fatty, with little trace of the excellent mustard sauce
The entrees are now nouveau Chinese-Japanese fusion, in the $15-$20 range
The crispy chicken was tough and tasteless, and I had to send the equally tasteless cod back because it smelled so bad
Terrible service as well - had to get up and leave to get the check
I mourn the loss of the old Xing
Xing is a refreshing addition to the burgeoning 9th Av
dining scene, pairing interesting dishes with a cool, retro atmosphere
We've dined at Xing five or six times and each time have been satisfied
The scallop satay starter is stupendous; the corn chowder rocks
My wife prefers the tuna salad, which is the perfect size for a light dinner
The crispy roast chicken is positively addictive--juicy and tender with an interesting spice/garlic side
We love the atmosphere, particularly the back room, which wraps diners in dark red velvet
The servers are pleasant, though not always very organized or quick
The bill for a two top will rarely cross $100 unless you get hooked on their fabulous watermelon bellini
Give this place a shot--you'll be back time and again
We were extremely happy with our dining experience at Xing
It is a gorgeous space and the service extremely competent and friendly
Our food generally was excellent; standouts included the peking duck rolls, General Tso's chicken, the salt and pepper shrimp and pork fried rice
We were less fond of the crab rangoon (too dense), steamed fish (too dense) and hangar steak (too spicy, overdone)
Cocktails were great and the wine list interesting and well priced
We will definitely return
A friend and I went to Xing to eat
We were seated immediately
without menus
After a few minutes we decided to ask the hostess for two menus
After decideding what we wanted our waitress showed up to take our order
She asked if we would like bottled water, sparking or tap
we asked for tap and proceeded to place our order
We received our appetizer and began to eat
without anything to drink
Not only did we request tap water, but each of us ordered a drink
Our drinks finally came, but we had to request water a second time
The waitress never came to check on us, sadly she only had three other tables of two
This is the third time I've eaten here
the food is good, but the service has never been great
A lack of resturaunt basics execution
What a wonderful place to eat! It is priced a little bit higher than the average take out place, but I think that between $3 - $12 for appetizers is a steal for none greasy chinese food
I have tried to go back to the greasy Chinese Food and I cannot do it
Xing has made me raise my expectation of what Chinese food should be
The service is great and servers
are always friendly as its a relaxed atmosphere and good times always ensue
I will definitely be back
The quality of food is well worth the extra dollar of two you pay
Not not mention, it is a sexy dining room
Uh, helllooo it's Chinese food
Plain and simple
Is it better than your average take out? maybe, but at twice the price and half the portions it should be
Maybe nice for the theater crowd looking for that NYC experience, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary
I think they are trying to pay for the sharp decor
the food is moderately priced, for how tasty it is
The spring rolls and dumplings were especially good
Service was friendly and courteous and the restaurant has a buzzy, yet relaxed atmosphere
Excellent
the bar and the red decor in the back provides great loungy feel
chinese food/selections were ok, not the best i've had
service was prompt and friendly

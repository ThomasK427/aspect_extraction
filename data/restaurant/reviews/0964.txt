The shrimp ceviche was great and the cocktails rocked! The black bean soup was great as well
I love this place! I went there with a group of co-workers after for dinner and found it to be reasonable and quite good
The guacamole is almost as good as Rosa Mexicano
But this place is nice and quiet and not as rowdy
Highly, highly recommend this place!
Sushi Mambo foods are Fabulous
those were amazing
Among numerous Japanese restaurants in NY, sushi mambo is the one of best resturant
its fish is always fresh, and teriyaki is sooooo good, specially seafood teriyaki
in addition, its service is sooooooo friendly
I can strongly recommend
Never regret
This place is on my favorite street in the West Village
Great atmosphere and friendly service
We always get the couple's sushi and one of their dragon rolls
You will be plenty full with all this food
It comes with miso soup too
Right now, they have a special for $1 beers, who can beat that! If you are looking for great sushi, this place has fresh, big, yummy sushi
My fav in NY so far
I am a regular at Mambo, and am never disappointed
The fish is always fresh, and the taste and quality are consistent
They have an extensive menu of both hot and cold dishes, including many interesting appetizers-- I particularly enjoy the pan-fried gyoza and anything tempura, as it has always been light and crispy
One criticism-- the hot food is sometimes scalding hot, causing me to suspect that they are using a microwave to heat it up (this was the case with beef negimaki, for example, which remained inedible for close to ten minutes, and then it was delicious)
However, I overlook this issue because I really go there for the sushi, comfortable surroundings, friendly staff, and reasonable prices
And their $1 sake/beer deal on weeknights is pretty great, too
My wife and I have been coming here at least once a week and love it
The lunch specials are HUGE and under $10
The atmosphere is very nice, especially during the warmer months when the doors are opened to create an open-aired environment
The shush platters are a great deal
I've brought friends and still couldn't finish the platters
our bill cost us something like $15 each (including drinks) at dinner for more food than we could eat
It's a dim atmosphere with an open aired kitchen/sushi bar
The music is modern American rather than oriental type music typically played at sushi bars
During the winter they have a special for $1 Sapporos and $1 Sakis when you order from the menu
That's all night too
you drink 10, you pay $10
great deal
I've been taking advantage of that
Anyhow, I highly recommend this place!
This has become a sushi restaurant staple for husband and I
The sushi is fresh and the portions are fairly large making this a great value overall
The service is good and it's nice when they open the doors when it's warm out
The fried tempura (green tea) ice cream is fantastic
You can't get such a great dessert anywhere else for under $7 and it's big enough to share
the sushi is fresh and they're not cheap with the portions
the prices are very reasonable and the service is always excellent
i eat here a couple of times a month and have never had a bad experience
the restaurant is also very clean which is a HUGE plus
I go to Sushi Mambo at least once a week and it is the best I have found here
The sushi is always fresh and the staff is friendly and efficient
You can't beat the neighborhood either!
On our way to another restaurant with some friends we happened by Sushi Mambo and on a whim decided to stop in
The sushi was great and the service was superb
I'll definitely be back and would recommend this to anyone that enjoys quality sushi and great service
The fish and chips are to die for! Great food, great service, and great beer selection! What more could you ask for from a neighborhood bar?
more of a neighborhood bar than one could ask for
great beers, atmosphere, variety and of course staff
reccomended for pool table, comedy nights, fish sandwich, and very good beer
in this area there is nothing like it
Living on the UPE there are few nice bars to go to, but Merrion Square has it all
Great atmosphere, comfy decor, good food and fun-loving staff
Great to have a party in or if you want to hang out and catch a band, sing a little karaoke or get a good laugh from the stand up comedians, it's the place to be
All it takes is one visit to love the place!!!!!
I recently booked a party at merrion square and it worked out great
Really nice space nice high ceilings and great width to the bar
The service was excellent and the food was great
This bar has good food, great beer selection, good jukebox and outdoor seating
But there is no reason to charge as much as they do
Every other bar in the area serves drinks for much less
With the closing of American Spirit's outdoor area Marion Square could get a lot of business if it were slightly less expensive
$5 - $6 a beer is way too much to ask for in this area
If you drop your prices they will come
I moved to the area about two years ago and was a little disapointed with the bars in the area because alot of them are dive bars
I came across merrion square about a month ago and said i would try it out
The service was excellent and the food was great
They also have a great selection of beers and nice outdoor seating
Highly recomended if you want a change from every fast food and italian rest in the area
I HEARD ABOUT THIS SPOT AND A FRIEND OF MINE INVITED ME THERE FOR NEW YEARS EVE
I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE DECOR, IT WAS A CROSS BETWEEN AN OLD 80'S PUB AND A BASEMENT PARTY AND THE BAR STAFF WAS VERY RUDE AND WHEN I CONFRONTED THE MANAGER/OWNER, SHE HAD AN ATTITUDE
NEVER AGAIN WILL I SET FOOT IN THIS PLACE AND BELIEVE ME YOU'RE NOT MISSING A THING BY NOT COMING IN
The Scene All rounded corners and translucent surfaces, this space has a clean, unshowy ambience
White walls and seats contribute to the feeling
Service is polite and efficient, and the clientele casual and local
The Food This is not the two-dimensional, giant-flavored Thai food that's so common
Instead, the seasonings are delicately, artfully layered, so that subsequent mouthfuls reveal new nuances
Beef satay has sweet hints of cardamom and other spices lurking, and is served over a subtle fried rice laden with pineapple, cashews and vegetables
Tom kha gai soup balances coconut richness, earthy galangal and tart lemongrass in excellent proportion; pad thai achieves a crisp-and-chewy texture with no gumminess or excess sugar
Even a simple onion-and-basil saute is richly, complexly flavored
Bringing one's own beer, such as a full-bodied ale to complement the spice, is highly recommended
Put simply, the food is not good
Don't waste your time or money
There are far better Thai places in the area
The food is really good
The wok dishes are amazing and the appetizers are super tasty
Delicious! The atmosphere is a white room and they always have the work of different artists on the walls
Gives a nice warm touch
Have never had to wait to be seated and the wait staff is friendly without being overbearing
It's a great dinner at a reasonable price
The food is very average
Not bad, but definitely not special enough to get this rating

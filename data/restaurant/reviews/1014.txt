We had a 9:30 reservation for 4 but they told us we couldn't be seated until 11
We ultimately agreed to a table in the lounge which was loud, crowded and not at all romantic
They didn't even apologize or offer us a round of drinks
To top it off our waiter was aloof, snooty, and rude
On the bright side, the bar where we spent much to much time waiting was first-rate
I went here with my girlfriends for restaurant week
everything was A+
the service, the food, the Alice in Wonderland gone super classy details,
all around fabulous! I am very picky but here they thought of every detail from the food presentation to the super clean restaurant
Loved it!
The markup and wine is ridiculous and they seat you so close together you can hear every word of your neighbor's conversation
NOT ROMANTIC AT ALL
The lighting is so bright, you can see every blemish on the tablecloth
And the people who clean the tables, brush the crumbs off the table and--not into a napkin--but onto the floor
For the price, can you buy a little class?
Let me start off by saying that the place is very small and tight
The decor was not impressive at all; the restaurant used to be an old brownstone
Waiters were very friendly and attentive
Also very knowledgeable with the wine list
I tried their tasting menu, and I must say most of their dishes are very good
Desserts were mediocre
I probably wouldn't go back due to how loud and congested it is in there
I was so impressed with my lunch meal recently
I read other reviews and I can see that Dinner maybe hectic there but lunch was a real treat
The service staff was attentive because the restaurant was not crowded and it was the summer
I'll go back but not during peak times
the food is so wonderful that I don't want to feel rushed to enjoy it or put off if the staff is overworked
I'm sticking with lunch
such a delight!!!
went to DBD a month ago
Ordering the food was great and everything was cooked and tasted great
The main problem was the Sommelier: the wine on there list was horrible (not corked, but off or a totaly bad choice for a wine list), asked the Sommelier to taste it and he claimed it would open up, it didn't nore would it ever have
After sending the bottle back he sold us another Pinot Noir it ended up being something of no quality and cheap
When I went to the wine store the next day i found the same bottle for $15 and the restaurant had charged me $80? After sending them a letter about our unpleasent experience, they never responded? I live in very close to the restaurant
but NO THANKS They will take you for a ride that you don't want and then charge you for it too
I took my parents to davidburke donatella, and I can NOT believe how bad everything was
The food was horrible and the waiters were running everywhere (in such a small and crowded place)
To conclude, the AC WAS NOT WORKING!!!! Everything was completely awful!!!! I do not recommend this experience to anyone
Rarely have I seen such outstanding service
The staff was extremely attentive and handled everything with grace
No glass of water risked being left empty and no bread crumb stayed on the table for too long
At the same time, the staff remained unnoticeable and unobtrusive
The food was delicious
The bread was very nice
The steak, and lobster steak were delicious
The presentation was outstanding one of the best Ive ever seen
This was an outstanding dining experience
We went for a romantic dinner on Valentine's Day, but it felt more like we were part of a factory assembly line
We didn't have time for a breath between courses! We were seated in the hallway between the bar and the main dining room, so there was high traffic and noise from the bar all night
The food was creatively presented and quite good, but the environment precluded an enjoyable evening
Given the amount we paid for the prix fixe and wine, we should have sat there all night instead of being herded out, albeit gently
Great food--Don't get me wrong
Absolutely stunning presentation and wonderful flavors like I've never experienced before
However, if you don't enjoy waiting over an hour past your reservation time in cramped, uncomfortable settings, go somewhere else
The frazzled staff did their best to calm frustrated patrons, and by their formulaic responses and seemingly scripted apologies, it seems like this is an everyday experience
We eventually settled for an uncomfortable table in the lounge area, but only after being promised and promised that our table would be ready any minute
We got tired of waiting and opted for our table in the lounge
Too bad you can't order delivery
If you could afford it, it would be well worth it
I had the pleasure of dining at DBD with two of my friends- between the three of us we have have dined in over 90 countries, and DBD surpassed them all! Talk about recreating the wheel! From the Lobster Steak which was divine, to the Foie Gras Terrine to the desserts
it was heaven- he is the Willy Wonka of Food! Pat in the kitchen is superb! But mostly we felt so comfortable there, the ambience is very warm and the staff ultra attentive! When you come back from the loo, your knapkin is folded for you on the table again! We spent two and 1/2 hours in gastronomic delight and it was worth every calorie!! Kudos to David Burke and his team for creating a Wonderama in the restaurant world once again
!
Superb dining experience on Thanksgiving
As a party of 10 I was somewhat nervous reading previous posts but from the moment we arrived to drinks with the chef on leaving, we all found the food and the service to be impeccable, relaxed and friendly
Our host's insight and passion for the dishes on the menu was infectious
All looked and tasted superb
The wine list contained some excellent and coveted lower priced bottles and the overall bill was a pleasant surprise!  Looking forward to visiting New York and this restaurant again
I will add to the list of complaints about this restaurant
We had a 10 o'clock reservation and finally were seated at 10 til 11 o'clock
While waiting there was no room for standing and the bar staff and their drinks were horrendous
After seeing our seating arrangements we decidied that was it and that we will never go back again and tell any others not to waste time with this terrible service restaurant
Good: Burke is definitely one of the most visually creative chefs in town
Desserts especially
Petits fours on a little stove
Cheesecake lollipops with different flavors
Entrees and appetizers are generally pretty to look at as well
Some overwrought
Bad: expect $100/head without wine
Wine 2
5-3x markup though a couple of good finds
Including latitude info on wines-why bother? Flavors of apps and entrees fell short of the visuals
Some things (lobster, shellfish) came out lukewarm
Service was professional but not especially warm
The crowd--mid 50's- to 70s
Lots of plastic surgery
People with more interest in being seen spending than in what they were eating
And it's a crowded, closely spaced place
To sum: the place matched the clientele-trying more to look good than deliver the goods, more style than substance, ultimately artifical and contrived
My husband and I went here last night and fell in love with it
We had a 9:00 reservation and they sat us at 9:10
As we sat down they explained everything on the menu and took care of us
The food was a 9 out of 10 and service was amazing
The people there were a little stuffy for our fun attitude, but we made it work
I would highly recommend this for a special occasion
Don't arrive hungry because they do not manage their reservations
After being told that our table would be ready shortly, then after a short while,it would be 15 minutes, then
it was an hour and a half before we were seated
The crowded bar area is an unpleasant place to be kept waiting and promises that they will make it up to us next time fell on deaf ears
Portions are small and prices are high
Some dishes fell flat

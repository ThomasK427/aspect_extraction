At 6pm the garden was half full with cocktailers enjoying the sweetness of doing nothing
They don't pressure you to order food like other places in Soho
We will be back!
I have to agree with the reviews that question the service
it is average and a little attitudey
it is nice that you are not rushed
but it nice to get a little more attention
The garden is somewhat cramped and you have the feel of almost sitting on the lap of the person at the table next to you
The food?
the apps were delicious, eggplant forno is something that should be a main course
the main courses were average
The country chicken is slab of fried chicken
but the sides complimented it nicely
Hanger steak was so-so
The chocolate pudding dessert was the high-lite
cracked our personal top 20 desserts from around the world
not top 10 worthy
but worth trying
recommend going here for the dessert and wine only
My husband and I just moved into the neighborhood and were happy to try this little spot
almost seems like it belongs in ancient rome or something, i guess being on cleveland place, is pretty remote
The garden was not open the day we tried it
the owners were in it planting herbs and flowers
We tried two paninis, on great bread, crisp fries and a rose
pretty affordable for Soho
I have been here twice now for social gatherings and the food is fairly good, but the service is terrible
We had to flag them down for service after waiting for over 15 minutes for even a glass of water, then our waitress disappeared and a new person showed up who was a complete flake
The hostess has such an attitude here it's pointless
After just recently going back and experiencing it all over again I was compelled to inform everyone else, and this will be my last time here
We wanted to sit in the garden out back, which was empty, but was told there was a party
An hour later the garden was still empty
There are thousands of other restaurants in the city and I recommend skipping this hole in the wall and heading elsewhere
We went there to celebrate two birthdays
We were half hour late but they accomodated us graciously! We had a great waitress - very pleasant yet very professional
They accomodated meal changes
The food was superb
I recommend the Cod and the Chicken! The garden was very pleasant (we lucked out with the weather)! We will definitely go back! I want to try it in daytime!
Attended a bridal shower brunch for 20 people yesterday
This restaurant is under the radar screen
Good for us! The staff were eager to please, the food simple-lots of organic products
The best dessert was the coppetta, like a sundae with gelato, pears, and lots of homemade whip cream
Yum!
Cleveland Place? Never heard of it
This restaurant reminded me of an experience we had walking around Rome in an area called Trastevere (actually we were lost) and stumbled upon a gem! The dining room is special with little knick knacks from Italy, but the food, like Italy, simple and delicious!
A group of us had dinner here
The decor was very charming and cozy
We had an 8:30pm reservation
Of course we were pretty much all there 10 minutes early
We were not seated until 8:45pm
We were sitted next to a very large table which looked as though was a bridal shower
This was fine but when your service suffers because of this , it's a bit unbearable
Needless to say our orders weren't taken for quite some time
They seemed understaffed at least for that night
We ordered the zuchini and tiger shrimp appetizers which were both fine
Ordered the Wild Mushroom Risoto which was very salty
In the end we our table had three bottles of wine and we were celebrating a birthday
We still had a great time
But the service could use some work
Beautiful and charming interior
Food was very good and service lets you take your time
A wonderfull place to relax and enjoy
Arrived here for a very late date ( we got there right before closing) and were one of the last tables there
The food was delicious! My hanger steak simply melted in my mouth ! We ordered the Piatto Di Vatutto, yummy antipasto with cheese and the waitress was very kind and didn't rush us even though it was late
We ate in the outside patio ( which was cute but not deserving of the best outdoor dining award)
I would highly reccomend this place for the food !
Our dearest friends were married here last weekend and I must say, this is a hidden jewel
Never heard of the place, so we got the invite and shrugged our shoulders
The garden is special
old stone floor, wind chimes, stone figurines, hanging flowers
The food was the best wedding food I have ever tasted!! summer tomatoes and mozzarella, a salmon dish, and seasonal fruits and honey lavender ice cream
We will certainly return and check out the other menu
I know we live in New York City, but when you advertise Patio dining, I would expect a decent sized patio
The patio is run down with cheesy decor
The food was saturated in oil and was not worth the price paid
Not recommended
I wasn't very impressed by Vatutto - the menu
the food or the garden
One of my favorite restaurants for a longtime,due to the gnocchi
So when my parents were here for my bday,I recommended we all go there
We arrived,looked@the menus and--NO MORE GNOCCHI!!!They have CHANGED CHEFShave a completely different menu now
Still excellent food,withgreat ambiance,but there are a million of those restaurants--the reason to go to VaTutto above others was thegnocchi
THEN,because it startedrainingthey had to move thegardendiners inside,we were asked by the owner(?)to move to thebar fordessert
We agreed since people hadbeen waiting 2hrs past their reservation
But they failed to secure us aspot at thebar,so we just stood inthe middle ofthe restaurant for20mins,letting our coffee getcold
We complainedwe were finally given another table
Our waiter was extremely niceapologetic andthe hostess comped 2bottles of wine,so it was okay in the end,but still an incrediblyannoying hassle
That,combined with the tragic loss of gnocchi onthe menu,mean thiswill definitely not remain afavorite anylonger
Too bad;I'll miss it
very lovely dining room,but really great garden dining area
one of the most comfortable  we've found in n
y
and the food is dependable,consistent and quite good,not to mention well priced
the staff,i think,is sometimes overwhelmed when the place gets very busy,but they are at least always pleasant and helpful
all in all,one of our favorite italian places in new york
call ahead if you want a garden table though
We took our mom, two grandkids and elderly brother-in-law here on Mom's Day
The staff could not have been kinder
They brought both kids crayons and coloring books to keep them occupied
and recommended several kid friendly dishes
We reserved in the garden, but it was too cold

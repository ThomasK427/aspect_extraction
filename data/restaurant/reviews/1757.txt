I will say that by my second order the amount of rice had definitely increased
I couldn't finish it
Stick with the sushi pieces or the hand rolls
Overall it was pretty good
I'd go back
The Scene Frank's has been in business since 1912, and the great old meatpacking space is getting long in the tooth: waiters meander without purpose, and the room sits mostly empty
Much of the restaurant's business seems to come from private functions
The Food Careful navigation of the classic steakhouse menu can yield a satisfactory second-tier steakhouse experience
Appetizers, like shrimp cocktail, and sides, whether hand-cut fries or creamed spinach, all perform admirably
As do some steaks, like New York Strip, though deviations into other cuts of meat are less rewarding: The filet mignon is barely an inch thick, the t-bone for two is mushy and gristly, and anything from the Italian menu is caveat emptor
First of all, This place is one of the best steakhouses in NYC
I am shocked about the review found on this site
Thier filet mignon is incredible, as is everything else there
Second of all, the people and service are top of the line, and could not be more attentive
Third, the review written for Franks on this site is OLD! They are now located in the Chelsea Market, and don't have a glassed in room in the back anymore
Trust me, this place is worth going back to again and again
Delicous!
On a visit to the city my husband nad I wanted to try Frank' since it was in the neigborhood of other places we were going to
It was 2pm
We were quickly seated and that is about it
Our old waiter came over to take a drink order
My husband had a soda and I wanted water
He brought the soda but not the water
We had to stop him later to get a menu
In the mean time the table next to us were seated, had drinks, were told the specials and were ordering before we ever saw our waiter again
We waited for a total of about 20 minutes before we decided to take our business elsewhere
I wish I could have commented on the food but we never tasted it
There are too many restaurants in NYC for a business to have such poor service
The citysearch review of this place is 100% accurate
2nd tier experience
Steak sandwich at lunch is a great deal
Some cuts of meat are good, others are just insulting
Place needs a remodeling
I feel like they are just keeping the place alfoat and waiting to be bought out by a larger restaurant company
This abomination of a restaurant should shut it's doors promptly so as to not dishonor the memory of the old Frank's on 14th Street where it was once great
The food, service and overall management of the new Frank's isn't worthy of the reputation that was hard earned over the years
George would be disappointed!
Many visits to Frank's have all been excellent, the aged meat, all cuts, is always top grade
The hand made pasta, superb
Gigantic fresh shrimp, either cold cocktail, or Cinzano is best in NY
Be sure to ask for the home made Prosciutto ! Cheesecake, Chocolate Cake, and Key Lime pie are baked in house
Excellent wine selection, including an outstanding house red and white from Pellegrini
The Editorial Review seems to be of a diffrent Steakhouse
I've eaten the best hunks of meat in my life at Frank's and what I've sampled from the rest of the menu has always been way above par
The wine list is simple but well suited for the menu the staff is aways sharpe
Hiden under a scofolding on the coner of 15th 10th my partner I stumbled on the greatest cuts of BEEF we had in a long time service that match up with the beef
There is No other spot in NYC were you should eat Steak
Every time I've visited FRANKS the service has always been great the Steak mouthwatering
BIG steaks great drinks and a very comfortable room
We had a great time!!!!
Showed up here because it was the only place that could seat a party of 10 at 8pm on a Saturday in such short notice
It was clear why: the place was deserted
Even with the place less than 20% full, the waiter managed to bring us appetizers and main courses that no one at our table orderd
One of our party ordered a medium-well steak (a crime in itself) and it came out like a charcoal brick (what does well-done get you?
ashes?) Those instances aside, the appetizers were great but the steak over done and over rated (medium rare should have SOME pink in it, shouldnt it?)
Tough sell at these prices, when there are so many other great steak joints in this town
An amazing combination of a place to sit down with the family and have a good time or have a drink at the bar with some friends
Plus an extra large party area in the back
The food, service and the Italian mood that is set into the place is, well, amazing
Three of us went, hoping to find an excellent steak, but we agreed nothing there was good or worth the money
It's far west, a bit inconvenient, feels like an old, stable steakhouse, but the meat was tasteless and bland
Nothing impressed us
Truly one of the least memorable meals I've had - and not cheap!
If I'm ever unsure of where to eat, I head for Frank for great food at a reaonable price
By sticking with the pasta dishes (especially the lamb ragu, which is a special), I usually have something to swoon about afterwards while patting my belly
On occasions, there have been misses
The lasagna is one dish that is a pass - it seems to always come mushy with no determinable layer of pasta, cheese, meat, and so on
But everything else is normally a go, as long as you don't mind waiting for it
In Short Elephant
I have been going to this place for over 15 years now and it never lets me down
The wait staff are all pleasant and helpful and the food is always great
You can have a quiet lunch or breakfast alone here or dine with friends
The salads and omelettes are always good
I have always had wonderful experiences here and have many fond memories of dinners, lunches, breakfasts, and brunches here
Go and you will be well taken care of!
This place offers a diverse menu with tasty sandwiches, salads, and burgers, and surprisingly, excellent entrees! I had a catfish special recently, which was presented artfully and was even more delicious than it looked
I was delighted to find that you can enjoy high-quality food at half the price of many fancier restaurants, AND feel like you're eating in a cozy, intimate English pub
Perfect for a wintry night
Elephant Castle has the best brunch menu in the city
Simple and tasty, this is what the Village is supposed to be all about
The seating is limited, but the family-like, nonpretensious staff seems to always make everyone comfortable
The drinks and food are delicious and served with care
You can not go wrong at this restaurant
I ate at the EC for the first time about a year ago and have been back at least once a month
There's something I can only describe as 'old-school' charming about the place
It woody, oddly shaped and very cozy
The wait staff is young and friendly
The bathroom is through kitchen
The burgers are excellent and most of the other dishes are pretty good too
I view it as the quintessential Village restaurant - no Upper East Side frat boys, no Upper West Side families and NO Meat Packing district BT's
A New York restaurant for New Yorkers
Oddly enough the night that we went to dinner here the place was pratically empty
We did arrive at about 9:30 PM and had wonderful service
Our waiter was very gracious and friendly
The music playing added to the atmosphere
So the next time we go out late for dinner we'll be back
Oh and the menu is varied and has great options
i love this cozy little place and they have great food and make a fabulous omelette!!! Service here is very young but accomodating and i am never disappointed, which makes me come back again and again for more
The burgers are terrible! Ordered medium rare, they came out dry and well done

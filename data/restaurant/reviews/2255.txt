Tables were available and we were seated immediately
I would suggest calling ahead during prime time
My wife and I tried an array of comfort foods; duck with cherries, foie gras, steak tartare and the choucroute
We enjoyed it all, including the crusty French bread
We were surprised by the large portions, unfortunately we did not have room for desert
We will go back on or next trip to NYC
My wife and I were looking for another restaurant and gave up finding it
As we were real hungry, we came upon this place, took a chance and really had a good meal
Our waiter was fantastic although they seemed to be pushing the souffle for dessert but that also turned out to be good
the wine we had was also real good and I wish I could remember what it was
We'd definitely go back
I don't know why other people panned this place
I had a good dinner here, thought the service was very good and I thought the food was first rate
The crowd is older, but other than that it's a great place to meet old friends for a reasonably priced great meal!
What was once a grande dame of dining out in NY, has become awful
Being a brasserie, they've no right to charge though sorts of prices they do
There are still bright points in the meal
The seafood risotto and the halibut stand out
The sea bass special and the bouillibaise did not
Escargot, though cute in their mini-clay pots should NOT taste bitter
Service was condescending and chilly
An ice bucket was placed dangerously close behind me for no reason
When asked that it be removed, the waiter almost rolled his eyes
How the mighty have fallen
this place was ok, but definiately not worth the money
The service was terrible - we had to ask for the check twice before we got it
The ambience was nice, but it was pretty empty when we were there - surprising for a reputable midtown eatery at 8pm on a friday night
My snapper was ok, but nothing special, and my boyfriends fish was very bland
There are a ton of better french restaurants in the city for the price of LCB, or even less
Definitely would not recommend this place, and I don't think that we will ever go back
Good quality food and affordable prices
Its no coincidence that the restaurant is filled with japanse regulars every night
It's tough to beat the lunch specials -- they change daily and give you a chance to taste a variety of what this restaurant can do
The lunch specials are all around $12-$15, so it's not exactly cheap, but the food really is good
This is not the part of town that I expected to find a high-quality, yet not a fancy/fusion Japanese restaurant and I'm very happy that I know about it
Like a magical world opening up behind a tiny door, ISE offered up a deluge of fresh sushi and the warmth of plummy sake on a blustery January evening
We shared a super lobster tempura, a combination of mouthwatering sushi, spine-tingling wasabi shumai, crunchy spicy squid, yummy tempura icecream and some exquisite sake
Nobody speaks much English so much pointing and sign language ensued but it all added to the charm and wonder of the place
Will definitely go back
I just happened to stumble across this little treasure and I am OH SO HAPPY that I did
Their sushi and sashimi are mouthwatering delicious and SUPER fresh! The servers and wait staff were extremely friendly and hospitable
I defiantly will be a return customer!
This is definitely THE authentic Japanese restaurant in Manhattan
Yes, the large number of Japanese customers proves it's authenticity
I ordered Negi/Teriyaki combination
It's 2 terriyaki chicken thighs and 5 thinly sliced beef roll with scallion PLUS soup and dessert
IT WAS DELICIOUS! and the price $15! you can't beat that! $15 dinner with such huge amount of tasty food in Manhattan, it's unbelievable! Highly recommended!
the large Japanese crowd in this restaurant is a testament to the authenticity of the food here
Be sure to get the Izakaya (appetizer) menu - many of yummy little entrees there to check out
the yakitori dishes are very well done
service is prompt and friendly
ABSOLUTELY LOVE this restaurant! Food is super fresh, and the items on the daily special menu are beyond your imagination
Try to order from the Japanese exclusive menu
There are a lot of hidden treasures in it
Experiment! Teriyaki must be pretty good there, but don't waste your opportunity to discover more delicious and authentic dishes
I agree, it's a hidden gem of midtown
talk about the best traditional sushi in the city, you may be the only one inthere that speaks English, but the freshness is the best!
I have lived in NYC for three years and have been too many amazing restaurants
This was far from one of the best I have been too
I have never had such terrible service, with completely tasteless food that is overpriced
The waiters were rude, the service was terrible, not mentioning the restaurant was empty
Gratuity was added to a three person party and the service did not even deserve a dollar tip
There was no servic!!!!! I would never recommend this restauarant to anyone!!!! Unless you like being ignored, served tasteless food and overpaying
I would have had better food and service at McDonalds!!!! This restaurant is a turist trap and any intelligent person, turist or NY native would not and should not be caught dead here!
Seppi's is a very friendly neighbohood feeling bistro with greta French bistro calssics
The desserts are also amazing
Don't miss the chocolate buffet in Sunday
The prices are not low but hey this is NYC
For the area the prices seem very reasonable
Seppi's is another little gem in Le Parker Meridan's crown, in order of my preference, Burger Joint, Seppi's and Norma's, enjoy them all
I'm from Los Angeles, and whether I'm staying at the Parker Meridien or not, my NY hangout is Seppi's
You can eat at the bar and either snack or have a full meal
The mix of regulars and travelers are always up for a conversation, and the bartenders make you feel at home
And where else can you have dinner at 2AM after arriving from JFK?
This is a very romantic, late night place
We had a bottle of wine, cheese, pate
and no one bothered us about having a full dinner, hurrying it up for the next seating
just a relaxed, wonderful atmosphere that has all the ingredients for romance
I have eaten here about 5 times since its opening
The decor is quite attractive and I find the food to be quite good
I particularly like the recent changes to the late night menu which allows one the option of either a full meal or just a light snack
It doesn't hurt that I live in the neighborhood!
This is more of a bistro than a heavy french restaurant
I went there for a little catchup with the girls, the service couldn't have been better
I'm new to the west side and am glad that I have a place like this in the neighborhood
Would make a good date place, for quiet drinks or dinner
Braised beef gets kudos
We ate at the bar last night, and a real live movie star came in and sat next to us! Very fun, and the food was delicious
Patrick, the bartender, whipped up a hot toddy for my friend, and we loved the steak hache (hamburger with flavorful French goat cheese and delicious frites), the traditional tarte flambe, a thin crust pizza with goat cheese, onions, and prosciuto, as well as the onion soup, escargots, and sauteed spinach
Very pleasant, warm atmosphere
We'll definitely be back
Who'd-a thunk that there would be a good French bistro in west midtown, in a mainstream, middlebrow hotel, for gosh's sakes?! It was one of those evenings where I just didn't have the get-up-and-go to travel anywhere to eat--and Seppi's is conveniently a block away
I braced myself for Bland City, and instead was pleasantly surprised by a surprisingly brisk bar scene, quick service and hearty, fairly priced food
The house pate was earthy, flavorful and big enough to share; the steak au poivre was juicy and bursting with flavor
Roasted baby chicken was succulent and tender, and a carmelized banana tart ended the meal on a decadent note
If you happen to be around W 56th, and want a casual-but-not-dingy, nice-but-not-TOO-nice dinner out, you could do a whole lot worse than Seppi's--it certainly leaves overpriced, underflavored Rue 57 in the dust
The Scene This brightly lit, well-appointed restaurant on the ground floor of the Parker Meridien Hotel, serves the most over-the-top breakfast in town
Handsome baritone Nordic waiters patrol the room, proffering fresh-squeezed juices and $4-a-person pots of French press coffee
The restaurant is popular with the hotel's visitors, along with local business people who use it to entertain clients
The Food Norma's glorifies traditional breakfast food almost to the point of non-recognition, with dishes like mango-papaya brown butter cinnamon crepes, foie gras brioche French toast and a shrimp, tomato and egg white frittata big enough to feed a family of four

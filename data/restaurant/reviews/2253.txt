RIDICULOUS! She didn't even have the courtesy to come to us, we had to keep going to her
She seated at least 6 couples that came after us
NEVER AGAIN!
I made my reservations weeks in advance and when I arrived I was seated next to the service bar where they were stacking dishes so conversation was impossible
There was no light above to read the menu
Every 5 minutes, or so, the waiters came to restack dishes, so conversation stopped
They refused to move us to another table even when one became available
Instead of eating food from a third world country, I felt as if I was in one
I would NEVER eat there, again
The food was fair, but the hostess and manager were rude and unaccommodating
Well let me first start off by saying that the drinks are very over priced! The sangria is good there but that is about it
The service was lousy but the decor was nice
All of the food was cold including the appetizers
I am latin and I know what good caribbean food tastes like and this was not it
The food was bland, cold and just not worth the price
I ordered red snapper and it tasted like frozen fish from the freezer aisle in the supermarket! Don't bother with Victor's Cafe
Not a memorable experience
I had my brother's birthday here and it was a great experience! We were seated immediately and was greeted by our friendly waiter
The Sangerias were yummy (good size glass) and the Seafood Paella was even yummier (you actually get a whole half of a lobster!!)
The atmosphere is very festive and they even had live piano playing in the background
I definitely recommend this place!
Unless you enjoy heavy, greasy, bland cuban food, steer clear of this place
I'm not sure who the reviwers are that posted good reviews below, ut the experience was poor and fairly expensive
The best Cuban food in the city!!! I must say, I was very impressed
Everything was to die for
including their mojito! It's guaranteed good food and service
worth every dollar!
I came to Victor's for dinner
We were seated immediately, even without a reservation
The decor is very interesting
The service leaves a bit to be desired
One has to put some effort into flagging down a waiter
The black bean soup is delicious
The gazpacho is too spicy
The red snapper appetizer is served raw, which is not mentioned on the menu
It is not very good
The ropa vieja is outstanding
It was one of the best dishes I've had in a while
The prices are very reasonable for the area
A number of entrees are under $20
I am not a sangria fan and I didn't think it was particularly good, but I am told that if you like Sangria, the one at Victors is definitely worth a try
Before you go, find out which things are good and you should have a great time
I have dined and drank at Victor's on several occasions and each time it was enjoyable
The food is very rich and incredibly expensive (be prepared to shell out some dough) but worth it if you are celebrating a romantic occasion
The Happy Hour is great, with some of the finest sangria one can find in midtown
The staff is friendly and courteous which is why I continually come back for more
This restaurant exceeded my expectations
I went for dinner before a show wtih my boyfriend on 4/22/05
We let the waiter know that we did not have much time, and he made sure our food arived promptly
Excellent service! I had Vieja Ropas (old clothes), which was super yummy! Ground meat with mashed bananas, rice, and beans
They have the best beans!!!! My boyfriend had Fried Cow, which was better thne mine! For desert we got guava w/ icecream, it was delicious! Overall, the autmosphere was great, service fast, and prices not to bad for NYC
Where does Cuban food stop having seasoning added? Victor's Cafe
Bland pork would be kind
I know Victor's is catering to mostly Americans, but if you claim to make original Cuban cuisine, add the spices
As far as ambiance, I have been in subway stations that were quieter
Our waiter had too many tables to attend to and came to get our order and give us the check
Nothing in between
In general, if you want good authentic latin flavor, take the subway uptown to Spanish Harlem
The food was good
I highly recommend the Oxtail
This was my first time at Victor's and the food was definately worth it
The service could have been better
The waiter was a little slow
Overall, the night was an A
On and off, over the coarse of 20 years, I've been going to Victor's Cafe
Never had I been disappointed as I was during my recent visit on Valentine's weekend
I took my wife and some friends, bragging all the way about this place
The food was bland, the portions smaller, and the quality poor
From where I was sitting, I couldn't enjoy and appreciate the live music
In the past there was a trio who would play music while roaming the room
I've come to find that Victor has retired and that his daughter and neice are running the restaurant from Florida
IT'S NOT WORKING
Does anyone know a GREAT Cuban restaurant?? EddieS
the sangria is excellent this is a perfect place to make a great first impression on a date but make sure they are worth it because it is pricey but the food is well worth it and then some the staff is a very helpful
I love this place
I took my boyfriend there for dinner for his 30th on recommendation from some friends
All I can say is THANK YOU!!!! My new favorite restaurant in the city
The food is amazing and the drinks are just as good
Get a pitcher of their sangaria
I have to go back just so I can try one their desserts
We ate and drank so much that we were full by the time the dessert menu came
It's a bit expensive, but worth it and definitely make reservations
I believe this is one of the best restaurants in the area
For sure, they have the best tamales!
Victor's was a welcome change from the traditional midtown lunch
The atmosphere was quiet and the food was flavorful and unique
If you're looking for something different in the same-as-always-midtown, this place is worth the visit
VICTOR'S ACCEPTS LARGE GROUPS! That's more than we can say about may restaurants in the city
First, we seated promptly
We then proceeded to drink their fabulous mojitos (these are the best we have tasted)
After we had told them that we were going to the theater (Hairspray is next door), our food was brought out 10-15 minutes later
Our favorite dishes were the vaca frita, the snapper coated in crushed plantains, croquetas, and their ropa vieja
All the entrees also come with black beans (delicious) and rice
What a value!! We highly recommend this place
Reservations were made for a group of 10 people on the same day @ 7pm, the tables were ready @ 8pm
So what is the use of making reservations? Their excuse was that since the reservations were made the same day they had a difficult time finding seating for 10 people
In the waiting area they had 3 seats, the rest of the group and other guests not related to us were standing there for about an hour
Please note the reservations were made in the morning
I think they should have said something then and not wait till 7:30pm to give us that excuse
The food was alright, too expensive for the small portion of food they serve you

Filling but you will be so happy with the decision
Not a cheap menu
but shouldnt be cause it is great/quality food
enjoy!
Chef LaFemina's second success after Peasant, Apizz is one the restaurants in New York that I rather keep the knowledge of its existing to myself
Once you walk in you'll instantly feel the wonderful change of the scenery and leave the city outside
Fire burning in the open hearth gives a warm and comforting feeling
Excellent design elements such as the brilliantly positioned large mirrors on the brick walls makes the place larger without disturbing
Waiters are very helpful and quickly at your side when you need them
Most of the food comes out of the signature wood burning hearth in the open kitchen
I suggest the open ravioli, wild boar lasagna and crispy chicken as entrees and Apizz Margherita, Octopus and Mozzarella for starters but you can't go wrong anything from the menu
Nice selection of wine will make your meal even better and definitely save room for dessert
I tired Apizz on a whim and it was fantastic
The food was great -- especially the ravioli con zucca, which is topped with butternut squash, it is mouth watering, and the blood orange mojitos are scrumptious
The atmosphere is great for a date or just a nice get together with friends
Oh, and I love the lounge downstairs which is a nice waiting room, if you have to wait
Also, I totally recommend reservations
after hearing about all the hype on the food of this place i set off on my journey from the upper westside to check it out, to put it short i wish their was one in my neighborhood, really intresting place with very flavor full dishes, if i was a chef i would probably cook the same way,,loved it
date picked the place, I was a bit hesitant as I'm not that into pig latin, but dinner was so good it inspired us to write our first critique
Cool place, not too crowded but best ap I've ever had - crisply prosciutto with something sugary/fruity, kinda like 5 star bacon but better
But seriously place was great, everything we ordered was fantastic and would highly recommend for a date (but trust me you don't need the second bottle of wine!!)
Went there a recent Friday night with friends and we loved it! Our host, Xerxes, was very accomodating and friendly
The ambience was warm and inviting
The food was absolutely delicious - so many great flavors! I had heard good things about Apizz and am very happy we went - we will be back!
some real intresting italian food served in a place that is so cozy and warm, the self taught chef says our waiter is only cooking a few years, it was hard to belive
we were very impressed and will be back
Had a great birthday dinner here
The Margarita pizza has the most delicious smoky wood oven flavor
It's a rectangle with fresh mozz and sauce
Husband had the foie gras with strawberry and the gnocchi with shortribs
Amazing! Great warm atmosphere as well
Highly recommend it
When you pass in threw the door you just know
The owner wanted it to be right and right it is
From the greeting to the gelato everything is a pleasent experiance
Our meals exceeded our expectation, which if you dine out often you'll know is a rarity
The wait staff was attentive, nice, and well informed
The one thing the wine list lacked was pretention and it wasn't missed
Overall I really must rally for a place that seems to care about my food as much as I do and the proof was on my dish
One of the best meals I have had in NYC! Everything is so fresh and all the food has that stone oven taste which one can only really find in the heart of Italy
The feel of the place is really intimate and cozy, the service is really friendly and patient
One could not ask for anything more
i really enjoyed this place, its small, very unique and wonderfull tasting food, the place has a charm about it that makes me feel good
Love the meatballs, and rabbit gnocchi
no really, this place is cool and small and designed really well with this big wood oven, but i did not expect to have some of the best FOIE GRAS in it
we all loved it, its like your best friends cool apartment down in the lower eastside, and he is a great cook
I love discovering new places
This place has it all
Character, ambience and a menu that wows
I had the pork chop which was juicy and delicious
My date had the wild boar lasagna, which I thought was the finest lasagna i've tasted in years
can't wait to go back and try the meatballs!!!!!!!!!
heard about this place and thought I'd give it a try
Bad decision
The service was poor, my apps and entrees were all ill prepared
I definitely will not go back and will certainly not recommend this place
love these large meatballs with ricotta stuffed in the middle, enjoyed the wild boar lasagne very much, even though we are not sure what wild boar is, and the place is so cool and intamit
i cant belive where this place is and how crowded it was, its in the middle of no where, i guess the owners are so confident about there food that they think people will travel for it,, well they got me going back for more already,,
You know ther are not many places i know where you can get great Foie Gras and the person next to you can be eating 2 huge meatballs with ricotta cheese oozing out, and also amazing, its a very eclectic menu and yet some what simple
I have been here twice and cant wait to go back and try some of the dishes i missed, also the look on my guests faces when we walk on this empty block of projects and turn into this unassuming brick building that just blows them away is priceless
the room is so cozy and warm you cant help but to love it right away, thats what made me worry about this place, usually places that look good, dont have good food, well this place does both, and well
i had a Foie Gras to die for, it was wrapped in applewood smoked bacon, anything wrapped in bacon is to die from really, the salmon tartare is the way i liked it mixed with herbs and a lovely sauce with creme fraiche, the risotts was good,but the loin of pork was better
It is a nice little place with some great original feel to it
i told the manager i was going to go right home and post a great review , so here it is ! the first thing about this place i loved was the cozy little room that makes you feel like you are in a friends house, they have this huge wood burning oven that the chef cooks everything out of, its amazing, so the pizzas are great, the lasagna is great, but my favorite is the gnocchi with short ribs, its out of this world,so simple yet sooo good, well i will be seeing you guys next week, lisa
xoxo
just teriffic, food blew us away, and the atmosphere for a small place is so quaint, nice fire place, and sweet staff
from the moment i got there, i knew this place was for me, it has a speak easy kind of feel, it is so cozy and cool, and it has the most delicious food, my partner had the wild boar lasagne,which was great, and i had the pork chops which blew us away, that oven they cook out of does great things to meat, like carmelizing them, just all around nice expierience, cant wait to go back and try more dishes
This place is so indistinguishable from the outside
What a surprise when you get inside
I really was not expecting to see such interesting items on the menu
Too many good choices
Polenta with black trumpet mushrooms, lentils with plum tomatoes, risotto, and wild boar lasagna to name a few
I went with the polenta to start
One word to describe this dish PHENOMENAL
After that dish nothing could compete, but then I had the risotto as an entree with beautifully seasoned artichoke on top
I can't wait to go back and sample some of the other dishes
It kills me to give this place a less than glowing review: the service was wonderful, and the room is beautifully cozy yet hip
But I thought the pizzas were terrible
The cheese was gooey and mushy, the crust had no taste, and I was challenged to find a single seasoning on the entire thing
I truly hope the kitchen was just having an off night, 'cause this place has great potential
this restaurant has got something about it that you just love the second you enter the room, the warm cozy room is only enhanced by the delicious dishes that come out of this huge wood burning oven, a very special place to find down on the lower eastside,
just terrific!!!!! food, service, and a lovely cozy room, soooooooo nice to find
Had a lovely dinner there and was very impressed with the oven style cooking they do, also very nice and affordable wine list, warm and intamit room
they say all the food comes out of a wood burning oven, well i was really curious to see them do this speacial the night we were there which was lobster risotto, one of my favorite dishes, and well i do cook a mean risotto also, well no matter how they did it i really enjoyed it, it was so creamy and yet still had a bite to it, no mush in sight, my girlfriend really enjoyed her ravioli with wild mushrooms, and we had a half order of their meatballs which was a perfect fit to our entrees
AND THEY R REALLY HARD TO PLEASE, WE HAD A FAMILY GET TOGETHER HERE AND IT WAS PERFECT, COOL ENOUGH FOR MY YOUNG TOO HIP NIECE, AND NICE ENOUGH FOR MY MOTHER, WE ALL ENJOYED THE FOOD , ESPECIALLY, THE MUSHROOM PIZZA, THE PORK CHOPS AND THE MEATBALLS, THE STAFF WAS NICE AND VERY FRIENDLY, THEY GAVE US RECOMENDATIONS FOR DINNER THE NEXT NIGHT WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS GREAT
,,,OH YEAH MY WIFE JUST YELLED OUT HOW GREAT AND YUMMY THE BANANA CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING WAS
i live right up the block from apizz, and i thought when they first opened it was going to be more about the scene and less about the food, WOW was i ever wrong, and i told them i would write about them because of how blown away i am with what they did to this little brick sweat shop
The food is outstanding, the service perfect, and the vibe is confortable and cool, not to cool though
hey dont realize how good they are yet, i have been to a lot of new restaurants around here, and none come close,, they have the right stuff, food, service, and good wine thats afodable
I've been searching for the best pizza in NY and I think I found it at Apizz
but there's more than just great pizza here
The service was terrific, with a staff that is friendly AND knowledgeable (a concept lost on many restaurants)
The manager was very attentive as well
The ambiance of the restaurant is very cozy and inviting
And the pizza is terrific
The pizza bianca (spinach, mozzarella, parmigiano and ricotta cheses) is very flavorful, with a smoky and nutty flavor
The margherita was also tasty
We also had to try the vegetable lasagna, after reading reviews about it, and it was every bit as tasty as they say
We will have to work our way through the menu on our future visits
wow this place is so unasuming from the outside, we never expected this kind of design and cozyness in this place, i loved it, the lighting makes everyone look beautiful, props to the designer, also the food is what we keep us going back, i think they are a little undiscovered still, so getting in is not so bad

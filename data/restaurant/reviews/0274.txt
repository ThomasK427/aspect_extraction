Everything we chose was fantastic and they really helped us create our own dining experience
We started with several appetizers for the table to share, we split 2 orders of the pappardelle pasta as a middle course, and finished with a wide array of entrees, all of the flavors where bright, fresh and exciting
Wine, we started with a white from lazio, a pinot from alto adige, and finished with a beautiful Taurasi
We skipped dessert to run home to catch the Sopranos, what a great way to spend a sunday in park slope
Food is excellent; wine list is excellent; well worth the price
Don't be afraid to ask for help on the menu, it might be a little intimidating to some
All in all, this is one of the best restaurants in the city
The owners are great, the food is delicious and authentic and the atmosphere transports you to somewhere completely removed from 5th Ave
The Scene Throwing timetables and turnover to the wind, this homey neighborhood cafe operates on country time in the middle of the East Village
Veteran vegans and other health-minded folk veg out at rustic wooden tables appointed with tiny flowers; purple walls and hand-written blackboard specials add just a touch of funkiness
The Food There's nothing on this comfort food menu that's not organically grown and enormously portioned, and influences range from the Americas to the Mediterranean
Start in Mexico with fresh guacamole on homemade, spice-sprinkled chips, or thick Asian spring rolls with peanut dip
Hippie servers are happy to detail the differences between tofu, seitan and tempeh, so don't be afraid to go deep into vegan offerings or tasty daily specials (especially using lentil beans)--though hearty sandwiches, spread with homemade mayo, steal the day-to-day show
To close, curl up with an oatmeal cookie and a cup of organic tea
i love it here! not only is it centered in the adorable east village, it serves quality food with exceptional presentation
go for the guac and homemade tortilla chips to start- it's delicious
their salads are made with all fresh ingrediants and they offer stellar dressing choices
join the FDP (frequent diners program)- it's worth your time i guarantee you'll be back
The Scene Benny's Burritos is a popular whipping boy of the New York restaurant world, an institution whose Americanized take on a taqueria has incurred the sort of wrath normally reserved for a Starbucks
But all issues of authenticity aside, Benny's beating has been largely undeserved
It's a pleasant, unassuming spot for quick, cheap, fresh-tasting meals
And the service is generally friendly and attentive
The Food California-style burritos are the mainstay of the menu
Veggie, bean and meat fillings are usually vibrant, wrapped up in large flour tortillas with rice and a restrained amount of cheese
Tacos, enchiladas and quesadillas also make respectable showings
Used to be a fave of ours on a post-work Friday night
The food's delicious, the service is always stellar and the scene is crowded and noisy, but we wouldn't have it any other way
Don't get over there as often as we'd like nowadays, but when we do, it's always tons of fun
I liked that it wasn't crowded on a late Saturday afternoon around 4 PM
The margaritas came pretty quickly though the server did not take our order all that quickly
Guess he was giving us our space since it was pretty empty there
I was pleasantly surprised that there were soy substitutes for the cheese and topping for the vegetarian/vegan
Nice location and thought it was easy to get in and out
Not much a place to cruise the passerbys LOL
$3 margaritas at lunch time plus other great specials
Outside seating is great in the summer
Service is sometimes slow, but always friendly
Would recommend
I have been to this restaurant at least a million times, without exaggeration
My favorite, the Good Burrito which is, well, good
The food has the magical property to induce a comfortable torpor which is most appreciated in the wintertime
It's a fun place
Go there with your friends
Don't take your date there, unless you're really really desperate
this is a great place for a mellow, cheap dinner with friends
The barbecue chicken burrito is my fave
It takes them upwards of an hour and a half to bring an order 4 blocks
Calling to ask the whereabouts gets you nowhere
Naturally, the food can no longer be described as warm by the time you get it
Call it cultural imperialism, call it good - it doesn't really matter - just don't call it a burrito
This place belongs in a mall food court alongside its funk-faking brethren
If you want an Extreme TexMex Wrap, visit Benny's
If you want a burrito, hit Los Dos Rancheros in Hell's Kitchen
Can't go wrong for cheap, quick, tasty Mexican food - nothing amazing, but consistenly good
The chicken was dry and tasteless
Benny should really invest in some spices
I am completely addicted to the Mission Burrito
Service here is usually quite good, but sometimes inattentive
And it's definitely not the cleanest restaurant I've ever been in
But I am a regular, thanks to their lunch specials
The Scene Slip a few steps below the street, shoot down a short corridor and climb the narrow, circular stair where you'll find this shoebox-sized spot
The setting is unexpectedly Southwestern U
S
, with pastel-colored walls, pale green smiling frog statuettes and a Navajo blanket that hangs over the entrance
But the eclectic mix of tunes coming out of the small sound system will remind you that you're still in the Big Apple
The Food The food is Japanese and Korean
Opt for the just-right miso soup, the grill-it-yourself table barbecue, the fun shabu shabu and the stellar seafood bibimbop served in an earthenware bowl so hot it cooks the bottom layer of rice to a crispy and dark delight
Skip lackluster appetizers like the too-salty cabbage with plum paste, gummy kimchee pancake and uninspired cold beef with onions
Oh, and don't miss the coffee Jell-O
Whenever I long for SHABU SHABU, I come to this place
The beautifully sliced marble rib eye and bunch of fresh vegetables, attentitive cute asian waitresses, a semi-private booth, I just feel comfortable and relaxed in this joint
The most of locals are BBQ followeres, but SHABU SHABU is my high recommendation
how can you believe anything written here, if most of the reviews are written by the same iliterate liar, who is trying to pump up the restaurant? I and my friends, I and my girlfriend, I and my friends, I and my boyfriend, I and myself, I and etc
don't like the distortion of reviews wriitten favorably by one person
who could it have been?
I had heard about the all you can eat bbq and decided to check it out
Myself and another patron ate 3 huge plates filled with meat and veggies
THe waitresses were so attentive and offered to bring out more food as soon as they saw that the plate was emptying
The food was fresh adn well flavored!
I went last night with my boyfriend and had a good time
It was slightly too dark to see whether the meat was fully cooked or not but the service was attentive and friendly without being too much
The food itself was pretty good although it's not the best of meats but for 25 all you can eat it's a great deal
It's a pity they dont serve side dishes like traditional korean/japanese restaurants or that they give free vegetables to go with the meat
It was basically a lot of meat after meat with a bowl of rice
Pretty good place to go if you're really hungry!
If you are a meat lover, you can't miss this Yakiniku (BBQ) joint
Not only they serve ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ, including Sirloin, Short Ribs, Lambs, Chickens and Porks with delicious dipping sauce, the Shabu Shabu is also very the best in town though it's a bit more pricey
I'm glad that I found this place
I had a friend's birthday party here at Juju
We had a such a great time
We ate and ate AYCE BBQ untill we were about explode
The service was upbeat and fast, the waitress were so cute
They gave us a pretty birthday card at the end enclosed with a polaroid they took of us
It was very nice of them for caring us like that
Thank you
I'm definitely coming back again
This place stands out by its far superior shabu shabu
The high quality of meats and fresh fresh vegetables, and I love the combination of sauces they offer is just right
Eventhough JuJu keeps a low key, it's packed everytime I go, mostly by neighbor followers
The dinning room is so small but cute and intimate

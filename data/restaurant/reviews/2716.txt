I have been going to Oskar regularly for the past 4 yrs
It took me this time to realize which night is the best to go there
Oskar offers a 30% off on all btl wines with dinner! My brother-in-law- a serious wine lover- chose a Chateau Latour '81 for a great price
He said it was one of the best value for it in the city! Thursday night seems to be a opportunity to try more expensive wines at a better price
(their wine list starts at $22) We also enjoyed our dinner that night, but we always do
Thank you for everyone's hard work at Oskar! The Jules Family
I've lived in Fort Greene for about 2 years, and every time I've gone to Chez Oskar I've had a great experience and have really enjoyed myself
The French Toast for brunch is fantastic
And whenever I have been there I have never felt rushed by the staff to leave, even on a nice summer day when everyone is trying to sit outside
I've had times when I've had a hard time getting a waiters attention, etc, but I dont think thats so unusual
This isnt Le Bernardin, you know?
I don't know what folk's problems are, but Chez Oskar is great
The food is good, authentic and reasonably priced, especially for the prix-fixe and the cocktails are strong
Someone said scary murals; I guess it's a question of personal taste as I love the decor and the atmosphere
With all the variety of reviews, I suggest you go and find out for yourself!
I've been going to Chez Oskar ever since it opened, and it has a solid history of thoroughly spotty service
Of the constant wait staff turnover, there's an abysmal lack of retention of competent wait staff
Management is unapologetic for flighty wait staff, undercooked eggs, wobbly tables and other constant annoyances
The service sucks every time, but the food is usually tasty, even though the menu leans toward the boring and expected of French fare
The shabby interior complete with horrific wall murals needs a good powerwash
Too bad that Chez Oskar doesn't seem to care about making any improvements
Its a wonder how they stay in business
Ive been in the neighborhood 8 years and have never been treated so poorly at a local place
Maybe we didnt fit the hipster profile to merit good service
To start, one of our tables was lopsided; repeated requests to the busboy, waitress, and manager to fix it went unheard
My husband finally crawled under the table and did it himself
Instead of apologizing, the manager said aggressively, Oh yeah, whaddyou want?? (Im not making this up
) He was nice to others but just glared at us the whole time! The waitress was relatively genial, but she prefaced the specials with: Sorry, Im out of it today - my alarm clock went off late! and she never replaced a dirty fork we gave her
Food was good, but definitely not worth the awful experience
Im just bent on telling everyone the truth about Chez Oskar now: Unacceptably rude
I had the best experience
Table of 4 , every dishes were good, will recomand : Steak frites at $19 served with salad French fries and choice of 3 sauces
Mustard rabbit, Duck was perfectly cooked, the spicy lamburger was a killer
Thursday 30% off the wine list make this place almost a bargain
We love Oskar!!!!!!
I keep coming back to Chez Oskar, it's one of my favorites
The lobster crepes appetizer is to die for, they make a great steak and the salad nicoise is yummy too
Service is fine - not outstanding, not poor
On weekends making a reservation is a good idea to ensure you are promptly seated
Chez Oskar is consistently good in all departments
The blue cheese burger is under ten bucks and is juicy and cooked perfectly
It comes with the kind of thin crispy chewy fries that McDonalds aspires to serve
These delicious fires are not reconstituted though
I really love this place for its ambience as well so don't go there because I always want to be able to get a table
One of the most common complaints I see in these reviews is Chez Oscars service
You have to understand is that Chez Oskar doesnt move to New Yorks pace, its calm and laid back
The waiters don't hang over you, rushing you out
If you are looking for a great place to spend a slow, romantic night, I think youll find Chez Oskar perfect
Oskars features a great old world feel mixed with modern flar
The candlelight is always welcoming, the food is as good as you will get anywhere in NYC
Go to Chez Oskar to enjoy a great wine, go to catch up with an old friend, to get to know a new date, or to spend some quality time with your girl/boy, dont go if youre in a rush
For appetizers, wine, dinner, desert, great convesation, expect to spend a couple of hours
Relax New York, ENJOY!
It was by accident on a rainy Saterday afternoon, after having my hair couffed, that we, my sister and I stumbled into Chez Oskar to wait out the rain
We were offered a seat, then we thought why not some wine, then some dessert, then a meal, then more dessert, then more wine, then some spirits
I had to call my husband to pick us up
We were there for about 6 hrs
GREAT experience
Been back with said husband for dinner after a theatre night
Going again for our anniversay (New Years' Eve)
It's like a step into Wonderland
dining with my mother this past Saturday must have signaled to the wait staff that I wasn't cool enough to merit their attention
We sat there for 15 minutes before anyone bothered to take our order
I had to ask for bread for the table (several times)
No one ever came to the table to ask if we needed anything
Consequently, we had to flag people down for just about everything we wanted
Even though the food was really good, I'll never go back
Anyone looking for great atmosphere, attentive service and great food would be better served at A Table up the street on Lafayette
I love this place! Consistantly delicious food! The staff's pace leaves a little to be desired but the food more than makes up for it
I will be back again and again
I've lived in Ft Greene for three years and this is by far the best brunch in the neighborhood
The amazing quality of the food is really consistent, and I find most of the staff to be friendly
This place has a great brunch
It's never too crowded and the food is above average
The service is just okay and so is the decor
I mean this place isn't amazing, but it beats a crowded diner
i keep going back to chez oskar for brunch
and when i try to get brunch at other places i see why
chez oskar is a good deal
the french toast with fruit salad is lovely
the crepes are delightful and the omelettes are great
the service leaves something to be desired but you can't hey no one is perfect
it's a good spot with great tasting food
it's worth the trip
Nice place to get French toast on a sunny Sunday afternoon
Been in the neighborhood for years, nothing special but reliable
I think I worked out that over the course of my four years at Pratt, I spent 9,000 bucks there
that's how much I ate there
I dream about their coffee
They have a nice personal touch, after a while they know what you want and when they see you coming they start making it
It's great
General Tso's Chicken was pretty good
I ordered the Hot 'n Sour Soup
This was very average
Aside from my actual order being delivered, the only thing I asked for was a lot of extra soy sauce
I got 2 packets! It was delivered promptly though
It was pretty cheap too
Pretty average overall though
I just moved into the nabe, and decided to try the $11 large cheese pie
Tony (the owner and pizza maker) gave me extra cheese for no extra charge

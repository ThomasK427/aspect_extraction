I had my birthday in the downstairs section last month and couldn't have been happier with the turn out! The staff was extremely helpful and attentive, the bartender was amazing (didn't mess up one drink!), and the hors d'oeuvres were were perfect for the what we needed (highly recommend the mini risotto crecquettes)
The decor makes you feel like you stepped into a West Elm catalog (very hip and mod)
I recommend this awesome restaurant to all
I was here on 11/13 for my birthday and had a blast
However, do not starve yourself prior to dining as the portions are small
But let's remember that only the classy restaurants serve nice, small portions and as they say it is the quality and not the quantity
FANTASTIC
My partner and I wanted to have brunch before a show in the area
Gia was excellent: The food was creative and tasty - far from the typical brunch
Also, rervice, value, and ambience were perfect
Gia is a perfect example that style, good food, great drinks, and overall ambience don't have to come with a high price or an attitude
This place will make Manhattanites travel!!!
The food struggled to be considered cuisine
The service was attentive however lacked the necessary knowledge associated with the region
The initial course was disappointing yet we remained hopeful that the entre would compensate
Low and hold to our dismay both were saddening
The duck was over cooked and the chef informed us that this is the way the dish is served
The rib we ordered medium and returned it with chefs agreement that it was not medium only to receive another rendition of the same
I ended with the same whack duck, just drier cause they had to keep it warm
On to dessert, we ordered a port wine and they had to dig it out, literally, from the upstairs winery hmmmm wonder what's going on there??   Ambience is 9 Food is 2 Service is 5 Price 2  Best Regards,  Urban Critique
We've only had cocktails in their little garden but they were some of the best martinis I've ever had
And even though we only ordered a few drinks, the service was very attentive
Looking forward to coming back to try their food
well, after reading these reviews my boyfriend and i decided to try Gia
We live in Brooklyn and are always happy to stick to our roots and not venture into the city
Firstoff, I must say the food was exquisite (and we only ate at the bar!) as was the service
I can not, however, get over the reoccurant comments about how not pretentious it is
Pretention abound!, the maitre d' was particularly rude and uptight
He barely brought his nose down if only to rant to the manager? who scowled at us as she seemingly wished away the hours of her bored exsistence
Very uncomfortable atmosphere-and too bad cause it was oh so pretty!
My girlfriend and I dined at Restaurant Gia a few weeks ago after reading the other comments
I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and service
The food was good and the overall experience was pleasant
The one downside to the evening was the lack of patrons
On the second floor we were one of 3 couples in a restaurant capable of seating 40-50
The bar downstairs was equally empty as well
All in all, not worth a second trip
Our dinner was a bit of a fiasco
The service was atrocious: The one vegetarian in our party made clear to the waiter that her dish should be made without meat--and it arrived with meat
Drinks had to be repeatedly ordered
Dishes came out for two people, while the other two people had to wait 5 minutes for theirs
The food was hit or miss
My scallops and steak were very good, as was my friend's skate
The other two in our party said their dishes were average
Everything about this restaurant is fabulous! The mouthwatering menu sits among those of the top Manhattan restaurants and the wine list is simply a wine lovers dream! Elegance and style filter through the entire restaurant sans the attitude found at most of its Manhattan counterparts
Whether you choose to relax in the lounge with something from the exciting bar menu, sip a delicious summer cocktail in the garden or sample the soft shell crabs or striped bass in the upstairs dining room, you are assured a great experience at Restaurant Gia
You really must check out this wonderful restaurant
Everything seems to be polished to perfection yet lack the pretension that often accompanies such atmospheres
The food is good, the drinks are better, and the service is attentive
They have also recently added a spectacular Sunday brunch that you must experience
awesome interior, superb unpretentious service, and delicious meals coupled with spacious seating makes for a very hip new brooklyn hangout
the lounge is great for grabbing a drink and bar food, the restaurant perfect for an intimate date
three words or less to describe: classy, calming, multicultural
This place is an absolute gem, in an unexpected spot
Everything is so beautiful; the food, the setting, the glasses, the silverware, the furniture
It is totally hip inside, but the neighborhood and staff keep it from being even the slightest bit pretentious
We really felt like we had found a real unknown treasure
Four of us went and each ordered different things
Everything we had was great
They also have a wonderful, fun wine-list
We were able to get a Cabernet-Franc that was delicious and reasonably priced
Really recommend making the trip to Brooklyn for Restaurant Gia
If anyone had doubts as to whether Brooklyn, specifically, fort greene could compete with Manhattan's restaurants-Restaurant Gia puts all doubters to rest
Definatley stop by and try the soft shell crabs and their signature drink, Summer Punch while sitting outside in their beautiful garden filled with bamboo trees
I didn't expect the food to be as good as it is since this is a bar but it really is good and at decent prices
I've tried the chicken wings and the lamb chops
The atmosphere is really great also
I like the cool tv in the corner
The staff is very friendly, not stuck up like most places
There a cool lounge downstairs for karaoke or anything else
I was down there for TakeOut Comedy night
The first few comedians were just ok but the ones near the end were seriously very funny
My only complaint is the bathrooms say Men and Women in Chinese and not too many people, even the Chinese customers, know which is which
But they are single toilets anyway so it's pretty much unisex
My friends and I have been coming here since the doors first opened and we have never been disappointed
In fact, we are always amazed by the great service, the yummy dishes, and awesome drinks
The ambience just sets the whole mood right for a fun night out with the music pumping around 10pm and on
Yello always comes up with interesting and tasty drinks that will be sure to tempt your palate for whatever mood you're in
And to top it all off, if you're interested in karaoke, you can head downstairs for a crazy song-fest
They have a whole variety of songs including Chinese, Japanese, English, and Spanish
You can NOT definitely go wrong with this place
If you want a great, trendy place to chill with friends, this is the place
wasted our time ! not hip, not fun, wasn't even a real restaurant ! food was terrible
crowd was just a local asian hangout
whoever wrote those reviews must have been friends of the place
would not recommend it at all
Spent friday night there and loved it
Being out of the way one would not think this place to be so lively
To my surprise and delight the place was filled with a young hip crowd
The music gets turned up at around 10pm and that's when the fun begins
The staff was very polite and the service was great
The food,especially the steak, is excellent
I went to Yello on a Saturday Night and it was alot better than I expected it to be
The decor is very nice
The price is moderate
The music was great and made me felt like I was in a club
Also, nice group people work there
Yello was nice, a lot better than expected - especially the food
Was there for happy hour as long as regular nite hours and it was packed
Also the drinks were reasonably priced

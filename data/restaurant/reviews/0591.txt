The Tandoori Vegtables consisted of one piece of brocolli and and a piece of cauliflower the rest was onions and green peppers
Your Crab tikki was the size of a mini doughnut
they used to be bigger and the protions of your curry was a joke
How can hope to stay in business with service like this??
or burnt
and the tandoori chicken on the buffet is like rubber only harder
I have been there for dinner as well and one would think that if you pay more for dinner than the buffet you would get better quality food from the tandoor
your curry items are one of a kind (they are excellent)
I especially like your Tuna and the Lamb Melago
as far as the service goes it is great; the waiters are very helpful and attentive
but they can only do so much
I read your review in the NY Post and I agree with most of the review except for the part where he says that the waiters are as slow as sloth
your waiters are very knowledgeable and very courteous
I've traveled to India and the food at Kishti is definitely authentic
The restaurant has a great atmosphere - warm and welcoming from the sweeping staircase up to the dining room
Great lunch buffet for 9
95 - with lots of yummy choices
Half price happy hour in midtown - $4 FOR A GLASS OF GREAT RED WINE
Servers are happy to have you and willing to help you interpret the menu with no problem
You won't be disappointed
the lunch special is great
They are quick and friendly and are a great place for take out at lunch time
The food is tasty and they provide a nice mix in their lunch box
I don't know what this last guy is talking about, how about not mumbling your adress :-)? Anyway, ota-ya has the BEST spicy tuna rolls ever, I cannot order that anywhere else since I had them (only the spicy tuna bowl in cube63 is somewhat comparable from what I know
but not same price-value
)
One could even say that me and my bf are kind of addicted to them
We need no more than some of those and some plum wine for a perfect night :-)
The food here is good but do not get delivery
Not only is it painful trying to relay your order but I ordered instead of going there the other night
it took almost 2 hours to get our food (the sushi tasted like it was wrapped in soggy toilet paper by the time we got it) and the woman who took my order initially sent the delivery person to the wrong address
When he finally got there they offered to take off 50% for taking so long but when I got my statement they charged full price
When I told them about it and expected they credit the account they insisted my bank must have messed up
Genius! The portions are good but the staff is not bright at all
Next time I'll just drop a roll of tp in the tub and eat it for dinner instead
I was impressed by the quality of sushi and sashimi
Service is reasonably good
I was a little disappointed that they sell cheap gift certificates but then selectively accept them
Overall, a good value, good food
I recently went to Ota-ya b/c it is in my neighborhood and I was very pleased with my experience
The food was great and I loved the spicy tuna roll!! The fish was fresh and the shumai were tasty too! The atmosphere is a little off, but the service was good and the place was not too crowded
The prices were average as well and I will definitely be back
My group of friends like to try as many sushi spots in the city as we can - regardless of reviews
Here the sushi rice needs improving otherwise the sushi would have been very good
Pretty spot but we agree there are better elsewhere
The eel was rubbery and they don't know how to cook sushi rice
Too bad it is in such a nice space
Otherwise their fish was good and fresh, but there are places with better sushi for the same or lower prices
Try the Spicy King roll - its a meal in itself
Fresh fish and a nice, clean environment
Ota-Ya is just what we've been looking for in a Sushi restaurant
as Upper East Siders, we traveled the city in search of the perfect Sushi restaurant and it was literally under our noses! The fish is the freshest we've ever tasted in the city, the restaurant/kitchen is clean and the waitstaff is so friendly
Our fav's include Spicy Tuna Crunchy the Spicy King Roll
their spicy is the perfect combination between spicy and sweet!
My wife I lived on the west side and found this while visiting firends on the UES
We love it, and took buses and cabs to get there
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here
Fresh, Fresh, Fresh
BEST spicy tuna roll, great asian salad
Try the rose roll (not on menu)
Great, kind service
Feels like family when we go there
this is a nice place, sushi/rolls hot food just ok
reading the reviews built hi expectations so was disappointed
SUM IT: try it for yourself once i always say, but there are better spots
don't read all the hi reviews
See all those suckers lined up for Haru and Sushi of Gari down the block and around the corner? They're making it easy for me to get a seat right away to some of the bestest and freshest fish in the city
This is THE place to go in the Upper East Side for sushi, ambience and service
Even as I type, I have second thoughts about posting this, because I'd rather it stay the hidden gem it is!
Great Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon Rolls
They are seriously addictive
A bit pricey however
Otaya is easily the best sushi restaurant on the upper east side
The fish is fresh, and the specialty rolls are inventive
You haven't lived until you've tried the Spicy King Roll with tuna, yellow tail and salmon with tempura flakes
I'm an avid Sushi lover who has tried all the best restaurants in town including Nobu, Tomoe, Yama, Blue Ribbon, Sushi of Gari, etc
I have to say this place ranks at the top
Although it doesn't look that special on the outside and it is often not crowded, don't let this sleeper fool you
You'll find great service and the freshest fish possible once you walk in the door
Ota-Ya is hands down the best restaurant find on the Upper East side
As a matter of fact, it may be my favorite sushi restaurant in all of New York
The fish is always fresh, the pieces are large, the service exceptional, and the ambience terric (which is rare for a sushi restaurant)
The only thing I can't figure out is how more people haven't discovered it
And you should definitely save room for the tempura green tea ice cream!
Food is good and was served fast
Interioir is quite romantic
Service was great!
The best sushi in town, hands down
I've been to many Japanese restaurants, but the fish at Ota-ya is simply out of this world
The $17 sushi deluxe is a very good deal, well worth the money
On top of the sublime fare, the restaurant ambiance is superb
The restaurant is stylish, civilized, intimate
There is nothing on the Upper East Side that comes even close
Try it!
Good Part: The quality of the fish is commendable
The service is polite
The decor is trendy and comfortable
Not So Good Part: Not many people (no vibe)
The rolls were too big
For the whole package

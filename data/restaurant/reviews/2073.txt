The fresh pastas are generally a good bet: huge four-cheese ravioli are deeply flavored and mellow, and pappardelle drenched in cream, though heavy, have excellent flavor
I've been going there for over 5 years!! I go there at least twice a week
The food is great, the place is charming, very romantic and most importantly, it is very reasonably priced
Every time I've brought someone, they got hooked on it!! If I can rate it, I would give it The Best Italian Food
I mean, what's not to like? Great authentic food, great service, and very reasonably priced
come on now!!!!
I had such high hopes that the night would be good here once again but this will be my last visit I make and also for many others
After a night of bad service and a very rude staff I don't think I would come back
The food and the wine- was okay but you can find better Italian that has a charm and a romantic feeling
There is too much hype about the food and location and all in all dinner should be able to be enjoyed in all aspects, the staff disappointed and was unattentive
me and a girlfriend discovered this restaurant by accident on a very cold night last week
we were charmed by its quirky coziness and delicious food
i had the bucatina pasta with a pancetta tomato sauce and my friend had the sausage lasagna
sooooo gooood! its both romantic and cozy, i would come back on a date or with some friends
ask one of the cute waitresses about their italian desserts they are worth the calories
i will definitly be back and soon
i dont usually write reviews but such a wonderful little restaurant with its own personality needs to be supported, so it will stay around
ti amo tanti baci
A friend and I spent New Year's Eve at Tanti Baci
It was great
Not only the food (which was incredible), but the way they made us feel, like if we were family
Just before midnight, customers at the Flower Room came down to celebrate
, it was really nice! I will definitely come back
If the service and food was so good in such a special and busy night, I can't imagine how it would be the rest of the year
We went not really knowing what the Tanti Bace Caffe experience was going to be like
We were pleasantly surprised!! The service was great, the staff was attentive, the ambience was just what we were looking for
And the chocolate ganache
words can't even describe how delicious that dessert was post a bottle of wine and pesto ravioli
I would definately go back!
I've beeing in lots of differents Italians restaurants in the village,and no doubt Tanti bacci it's the best one
with the amazing Flower room and the funny,nice and good service from the Spanish waitress,you're soiree either with your partner or group of friends i'ts going to be unforgatteble
Ask for her,after dinner she will tell you her name and remember yours
I ordered Antipasta Special, which contained a big, cooked bug, which I almost ate! After telling Wendy my story, she said all the right things
I said don't worry
I'll just take my $8 back as a credit towards my next order
Later, I got a call back from Maria, (who I later found out is Paula) who told me it was their policy to pick up the food with the bug in order for them to credit me
Since I already threw out the bug, she suspected that I was making this story up!!! While speaking to me, she very condescendingly kept stating how young I sounded, and that I did not know how to run a business
Policies must be followed! In fact, I do run a business and so I know how to treat customers! Tanti Baci has lost this customer and I hope you too
I go to this place about 2-3 times a month (and I live in Queens)
I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine and was with two other people (total of 4ppl)
I didnt go back on my own for 6 months after my first visit and Ruth, the amazing server, not only remembered me from 6 months previous, she remembered what I ordered
With service like that and food, prices and atmosphere to match - this quait little spot is a MUST for anyone wanting the qutintessential NYC experience
I highly recommend the outside patio (weather permitting) as it is truly alfresco dining at its best
The Flower Room upstairs on a cold winters night is like eating in my own home
I would swear there is a fireplace burning bright when Im in there (even though I know theres not)
Go now - Go often!
with such great reviews, i was somewhat disappointed
the fresh pasta and eggplant parmesan were quite good, but not better than the myriad of other amazing cheap italian places downtown
we went for a friend's birthday and i was a bit disappointed by this mundane eatery
it's not bad, it just doesnt have a special feel
plus, i found the menu to be quite limited
nevertheless, the prices were good and the wine was cheap
still, i felt the restaurant lacked real personality
i think piccolo angelo and il mosto are better bets
I know no place which feels more like the old, Bohemian Villege must have felt
And it has it all -- a downstairs grotto, tiny a street level flower room around the corner and a sheltered outdoor cafe
The pastas are fundamental, the salads are inventive, the daily specials are often surprising and the deserts are worth the wait
And the atmosphere is as friendly as any in the city
Ask for extra spicy pasta putanesca, even if it's not on the menu that night
my boyfriend took me and a few frinds there for dinner the other night and it was the best food , service and overall amience in ALL NY at this price
The owner was VERYYY sweet and took great care of us
PLEASE go here and write your reviews
I'm a regular customer at Tanti Baci Cafe - the cutest and most charming Italian food, great for private parties - I had one of 20 people and it was amazing
Also, the staff is very friendly and pleasant
This is the most romantic little spot in nyc
The food is great
The atmosphere is warm and cozy, and on sunny days it's a fun place to sit outside and take in the neighborhood sites
This is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood
Whether looking to have dessert and wine at their outdoor flower room, or a dinner with friends or a date, Tanti Baci has it all
The service is fun and friendly and will know you by name after the first few visits
The food is incredible especially the carbonara and not overly expensive
This restaurant is definite must!
The atmosphere here is 'date perfect', romantic warm
but over the course of my three meals there, the food has proven to be a dissapointment again and again
In fact, my company always asks me to cook our next Italian meal! The sauces lack flavor, the fish soup while excellent the first time I was there, was absolutely dry and tasteless on my next visit
The service is nice, and again, romantic atomosphere, but there is no excuse for bad Italian food
How did this restaurant win a 'best of' ????
A couple of years ago, a friend who lives in the area introduced me to Tanti Baci
Since then, I've brought so many of my friends (especially out-of-towners) to enjoy the wonderfully filling meals here
Last night (2/11/05) was no exception
The servings are truly perfect
You get just enough food so you don't feel immobile
However, music choices and service have left me scratching my head
I will continue to bring folks to this wonderful hidden establishment
The food quality, presentation and atmosphere have declined significantly
The food is poor lacking the robust flavor
The service is unattentive and inconsistent
The atmosphere has the potential to be romantic but they have begun to play techno
It is unfortunate to see such a great slip so far as to serve flavorless canned clam sauce
This place was small (good thing) however everything in it surrounded you and made you feel like you were in your own house
The mood lighting was soothing to the eyes; the warm beats of Spanish salsa music in the background made it a very intimate stay
The waitress that night, Wendy, was fun and friendly
She wasnt fake, she was fun, upbeat and real
The food came just in time for us to enjoy a glass of wine beforehand
The food itself was delicious
The pasta was out of this world
They also have a very good list of in-house specialties
Wendy was such a good host that she even gave us a Valentines Day desert special on the house
The chef even drew a heart on the desert plate for us, very romantic touch
Overall the place is a romantic hotspot

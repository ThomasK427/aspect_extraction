It was truly a delight!
i went there for lunch during restaurant week so spending $20
12 on a three course meal I would think gurantees it as a good value
however if i asked would i pay twice as much for the same meal, i would have to say yes
the food was superb
the service was supberb- from hostess to waitstaff to the busboys
the ambiance was lovely, open setting not ideal for romance but there are a few nooks and crannies that a couple can surely hide within
also, though packed, the noise level was never too loud
midtown east (or west for that matter) is not exactly a praised destination for me BUT if you're in the hood and CERTAINLY if you're in the hood during restaurant week, then its a must -go-to destination for a truly amazing meal (try the curry chicken dish
p-e-r-f-e-c-t
)
I was expecting a lot more from Jean Georges, but in the end I guess you're really just paying for the name
Admittedly, the duck rolls appetizer was delicious and unique, but the poor service outshadowed any positive qualities of the food
We were seated promptly but quickly forgotten by the swarm of waiters
Every time we wanted something we had to flag one of them down and it took an hour after finishing our last course to finally get our check
The bottom line: it's good, but just not worth the high price tag
This is one of Jean's better resturants
The service and food were worth my time and money
David Kim, manager, runs a nice place
I recommend being adventureous and try the tasting menu
When going to any well established resturants for the first time, go for the tasting menu
It really makes the difference
What is on the usual menu is old and you won't get the chance to taste what they are really cooking these days
This is the place to go for the well deserved meal and not a bad choice for special occasions
I was here as part of Restaurant Week for lunch and I had the duck
There was something really wrong w/ it as there was much too much spice on it
I couldn't eat it at all as it was much too strong and was really disappointed with the meal
Service was good, and the appetizer and dessert were fine
I was still really disappointed with the main course, however
I hadn't had something like that in a long time
I've now been to Vong twice (once for dinner and once for Restaurant Week lunch)
The food was fantastic each time
As can be expected, the Restaurant Week lunch crowd was stretching the staff resources, so service wasn't as attentive as at dinnertime
Otherwise, I truly enjoyed the experience (the duck entree, in particular, was amazing)
Tip: The $20 prix fixe lunch menu is available year-round, and changes weekly
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Vong
The appetizer and dessert tasting platters are good and offer unique fare, however, the main dishes are quite dull
They do not use many spices or much flavor for a so-called Thai inspired restaurant
The best thing is the exotic decor and for the exorbitant prices, you can find better food elsewhere
i've been here 5x's, once with family, others on expense acct
each time have been very satisfied
the foie gra is excellent
spring rolls good most of the time (once overcooked)
always went with 3 or more we shared had good time
it is pricey asian pan-thai food
i agree cell phone usage is overdone discourteous here
ice cream/sorbet desserts so small leaves you wanting
SUM IT: if you can go on biz this is worth it
on your own, save your $$$
reservations are a must, it is always packed expect to wait also
The seafood here is some of the best I've ever had, the slices of salmon were sliced so thin they nearly melted in the mouth
The seasonings were perfect
The ice cream desserts were incredibly rendered by the pastry chef
This is one of the places which are good for rare occasions as it is fairly pricey
The ambience is a fun bright decorative style, the service prompt and courteous
My only complaint are some of the loud obnoxious patrons themselves
The cell phone rule should be enforced more as some annoying patrons could be heard loudly blabbing about ther personal lives or business, most obnoxious the loud texan boors
I had reservations for a week but was seated at the worst table in the room,against a wall near the entrance to the kitchen,very claustaphobic
The place was not busy so I don`t see why they would even use this table
My boyfriend ordered the monkfish which was served with the bone cartilage on the plate
Disgusting!!After looking forward to eating at Vong for a long time I was very dissapointed an d would never go back
It offers too much pomp and no substance
For restaurant week (Lunch Only) they had 2 selections for appetizer, entre and dessert
I had the spicy cucumber soup with grilled shrimp for the first course, salmon with mushrooms, onions and green curry sauce for the second course and chocolate mouse cake for the last
The food was excellent, the service impeccable and a nice time turn around during busy lunch hour
Went with colleagues for lunch and I was very pleased
Tuna sashimi appetizer was by far the best I've had in a while
Little pricey, but worth it
Drinks were good too, I had the Thai Basil drink
We had a great meal here
The black plate special was a delicious appetizer to share and was almost enough for a small dinner
Yes, the prices are quite high, but as long as I am getting good food, I don't mind
Make it a special occassion spot
It is lively, yet romantic and the varying flavors of thier food is what keeps this place going strong
I work for a company that has used Vong for groups as large as 14
Ask for the pit table, and bring an easy-going group, and the company credit card!
Took my BF here for his b-day the decor was nice the food was good, the service was excellent! but was too overpriced!
Took clients there to dinner last night and everyone had a great time
Wonderful and unique experience
Great food
Excellent service
Wine list was good enough and waiter was very knowledgeable on all food/wine selections
That said, I suspect that this is not the place for anyone expecting conventional Thai food - which is why I liked it
Tastes were subtle, not overbearing
And very satisfying
The monkfish was a big hit
Only complaint was that it was a bit noisy for conversation at a large table - they could turn the music down just a shade
The food here was not to my liking
The french-influenced thai cuisine was a bit too exotic and barely there
I was hungry and not satisfied with the whole experience when I left
If you like this place you'll probably like AZ as well
Went to Vong last night for dinner, and had a fabulous time
I had the cod with curried artichokes and my friend had the rabbit curry which were both great
Thought the service was excellent as well, very nice and knowledgable
My only complaint was that I thought some of the items were severely overpriced
$13 for an appetizer of two tiny crab spring rolls? It's a little ridiculous
I recently went to Vong and I must say that I was a little disappointed
I was expecting better food
The restaurant was beautifully decorated and I really felt like I wasn't in the city, but the food was nothing special
I had the duck rolls with a plum sauce, and the ginger chicken

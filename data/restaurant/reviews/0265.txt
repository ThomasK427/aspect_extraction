I love this place! It's a great place for a birthday party
The food was good, service was great and the DJ was awesome! We got the large table in the back and at the end of dinner, danced on the tables
Perfect way to start off a crazy night!
I love this place
The food is consisentely good, the service friendly
The other night we came with a group of people for a birthday dinner and they insisted that the birthday girl and friends do sambuca shots on the house
It's totally reasonable, comfortable and tasty!
This trattoria is great
The food is very simple but excellent
The prices will make you come back too
They have a great Carbonara, but don't miss out on their variety of Piadine (they just taste like the ones on the beach in Italy) or their great Buffalo Mozzarella
Even on Fridays or Saturdays you can still get accommodated for a group
The service can be a little off when they get really busy
But just do it the European way, wave at them conspicuously and obnoxiously and they will be right at your table
And they are always friendly
If you want to smoke, you can do so in the back room
This is my absolute favorite of the Piadina, Maltesta, Gradisca siblings
maybe it's because it was raining, but Gradisca was pleasantly not packed on a recent Friday night
The DJ spun some great house tunes giving the place a dance feel and not your usual sedate west village vibe
the pasta with lamb sauce was excellent as was the tiramisu and chocolate tore
Why try another Italian restaurant when here at Gradisca the food, the staff, the bartender (really pretty)
everything was fantastic?
The Scene Apart from the photos of flaming heads, this grand, dark room is sedate by the standards of the baroque Hudson Hotel
All but a handful of the tables are long communal ones headed by imposing thrones
In the center of the room is the open kitchen, encircled by counter seating
Its buzz long evaporated, the restaurant's core customers are almost entirely hotel residents: European and middle-American tourists
The Food The menu straddles two worlds: comfort food and inventive fusion cuisine
The former generally succeeds quite well: Rich tarragon-scented macaroni and cheese is a big crowd-pleaser, served steaming in hefty individual casseroles; likewise the sizeable burger and herbed fries, and the dense milkshakes
The non-comfort dishes don't work as smoothly: Rare tuna steak is completely overwhelmed by the pool of spicy coconut soup in which it sits; and a dish of farro penne with chicken strips, raw spinach, and pistachios just feels thrown together
Go for the meatloaf and the open lodging space
The food is high-quality, though pricey at times
But then, it lives up to all the Hudson has to offer
So this restaurant is supposed to have a reputable mac cheese but I was not impressed at all, especially for a $17 dish of it
I make Kraft better at home!! I went here for my boyfriend's birthday
It was just the two of us and our total dinner came to $150 including tip for an unimpressive dinner
The skirt steak was egh and the filet mignon was okay
Definitely had better! As for dessert, it wasn't even offered
Now that i think about it, I'm wondering if they even had any
With no dessert offered, we took ourselves to Morton's Steakhouse for a delicious Hot Chocolate dessert cake
Definetly Yummy!!!
I recommend the lamb shank!!!! We were a little nervous to come here after reading the last review, but I'm glad we put our fears aside and trusted our friends (they have been raving about it for 5 years!!!) The atmosphere is amazing, big long tables and an open kitchen - we were mesmerized to watch the chef's prepare our food
Our server was a delight, she helped guide us through the menu with honest insight
The food was suprisingly delicious, and I didn't feel it was overpriced for what it was (it is a trendy NYC hotel after all)
I'm looking for an excuse to go back and get another goat cheese salad!
The concept is great, but delivery is faltering
A restaurant is only as good as its weakest link, and here that is the wait staff
When I was there last, our waitress brushed off my effort to get her attention with: It's gonna have to wait, hon'! I could excuse that but she never got back to us and ignored the next attempt to flag her down, though it was not clear she saw us
After one of my party asked a different person for something, the first waitress came over and delivered a snide: I'm sorry you thought I was too busy! A complaint to the inexperienced manager resulted in him coming back to our table and announcing that the waitress had explained everything
Not making points on customer service
For a nice evening, I suggest looking elsewhere
This is a great space for eating out doors- you are roof top level so no pesky traffic noise interrupts your meal- and the food is fantastic and very reasonable considering this is a hotel restaurant in the Columbus Circle area
The bar can be pricey but the food and wine by the bottle is extremely reasonable and worth every cent
We had the spareribs which were divine (but watch that mustard dip!), the mac and cheese, duck pizza and ceasar salad followed byt the risotto, meatloaf and burger- it was all cooked to perfection and served expertly
Dessert was also great- small protions on the dessert but just enough
The entree and app portions were large and filling
I highly recommend- especially now that it is cooling off and being outside is fun again!
Food is tasty but basic and way overpriced for simple comfort food
The space is grand with a very high ceiling although it is one of those places that they keep so dark you are not really sure what you are eating anyway
The wait staff is good but the hostess was clueless (perhaps an off night?)
Mainly full of hotel guests who don't know that they could get a bit more for their money elsewhere - overall bland and average - just like its name
Its five minutes of excitment ended years ago, but if you are stuck eating before a show - it is better than some others in the neighborhood
Nothing extravagant, but a fun, hip place that I imagine would be good for a later dinner
We were guests at the hotel, and only ate one meal; the pre-theatre atmosphere was a tad thin
Prices are a wee bit high for comfort food, but it did taste good, and the service was excellent
If you've got a group of four or more, this place is a fantastic spot -- especially if they're from out of town
They'll be wooed by the atmosphere
Weeknights have become a lil' dull, so if you're looking for a hot crowd, pick a weekend night
GET THE MAC CHEESE
Other items can disappoint
i have taken out of town friends to the hudson cafetaria several times now, and my visit last night confirmed the reason why i keep going back there
you really cant go wrong, the service is always great, the food is good and a really varied selection to cater to all palates
and of course the ambience
an ian schraeger hotel
all in all a great place to take people visiting new york for a feel of the 'in' crowd!
Hudson Cafeteria in the popular and trendy Hudson Hotel presents itself in a cafeteria style fashion, with long group tables and a classic high school cafeteria style menu with much higher prices
There is however a strange array of choices from burgers and sandwiches to the meat loaf and macaroni to the pad thai (wait, where did that come from?)
When did Asian dishes become American? The atmosphere was great however
I would suggest requesting a private table as opposed to the communal seating which could be a bit much, especially if on a date
Overall, it was a good time
Food is a lil too pricey for what it is, but that is what we NYCers pay for the scenes, in which we socialize
After dinner, having the Hudson Bar and the Library Bar in close proximity is definitely a plus
On a saturday I decided to take my mom who was visiting me for brunch at hudson cafeteria
Not only the place was empty but when I asked the waitress if I could sit outside she told me there was a 30 minutes waiting list when in fact no one was around and there was plenty of space
The menu; egg florentine for 15$, burger for the same price and mac and cheese for at least $16, give me a break
We left and paid for our two iced teas, by the way the check was 9$
We went on Monday night and the theme was Moroccan Monday
There was a belly dancer and an upbeat atmosphere with Moroccan/Indian Trance music
It is definelty not a place for couple looking for a romantic evening, but if you have 4 or more people you will have a great time
The food was very good and the service was above average
No reservations are necessary at this comfort food restaurant in ian schraeger's hip boutique hotel, the Hudson
Before dinner, you should definately have a drink at the bar
Early reports were that the hotel was full of itself, but I didn't experience that
The room is attractive, and there are many communal tables as well as an open kitchen
The staff is plesant, and the experience can be inexpensive if you share things, especially since the portions are decent sized
The food is fine, perhaps a little overpriced, but seriously you are there more for the scene
In Short Named for the sign that hangs outside this former Fort Greene booze bin, Liquors continues the tradition with cocktails, snacks and supper
The eclectic menu, served in the large lounge and comfortable dining room, is appetizer-oriented, drawing on New American, Mexican and Japanese influences
Ceviche, teriyaki-glazed halibut and red snapper with citrus salsa are a few of the light, bright dinner favorites, but locals often stop by just for the rich dessert (tip: try the pannacotta
)
Liquors is by far one of the best places to eat in Brooklyn

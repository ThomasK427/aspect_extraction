We all want unique, right? What she meant was it sucks
She and her manager refused to have it taken off the bill but after a while, it was removed but not without a next time, you should listen to your waitress lecture
No tip
Want good Asian cuisine, don't come here
Forget the atmosphere, you can find better
I order for delivery fairly often and while the service is super quick and food good and chea, the staff that takes the orders is consistently abrupt
Today I placed a lunch order and the guy hung up on me while I was saying thank you! No thanks for your order-nothing! Reeeeeallly annoying
went there last night with a group that started out as three and ended up as seven
they didn't ocmplain about moving us (actually suggested so themselves) VERY nice waitress
the music is too loud, the noodle salad was just ok, but the mago martini i was pretty good and the sesame icecream and wontons are AMAZING
i accumulated presents and one of the wait staff got me a bag to put it all in
(there are baskets under the table to put coats in!)
This is another one of my favorite restaurants
You gotta try the seared/marinated salmon, coconut shrimp and the ultimate a glass of hot cider
to die for
the place is more of a communal setting
so you are practically eating on top of the stranger next to you
which just might be your thing
One of my friends introduced this place to me last summer, and I've been back a number of times since
Yes, it can get incredibly crowded and noisy (although it never seems to rise above a din), but the food is great and the prices are incredibly reasonable
Service is here is quick too -- went to the bathroom immediately after ordering, and the food was there when I got back
I recommend the seared salmon on curried rice ($9) and the chicken udon, despite the servers' warnings
I have no idea why they try to dissuade you from ordering it -- it comes with a green sauce, yes, and it's slightly cold
But it's good
Putting you out of your comfort zone as you sit next to a complete stranger, this place has a great vibe and the intriguing art of humans draped in noodles
Fast seating was a plus yet the air conditioning could have used a tune-up
The food selection wasn't overbearinig and simple to comprehend
Summer drink menu was great, although our food arrived before our drinks -- seemingly odd
Overall value was good, food excellent, making this a place to return to
This place serves great interesting noodles
The atmosphere is hip and the drinks are pretty good
Great location - middle of Union Square, and the service is fast although you may have to wait on the weekends
beware vegetarians! republic doesn't offer a single vegetarian option on their menu
their menu is quite deceptive, for they seem to have some vegetarian dishes (the vegetable soup, for example), where meat isn't mentioned in the description
i wouldn't have known unless i had asked the waitress beforehand
Republic is ALWAYS busy from lunch to dinner
but beware because this place is a well-oiled machine
The hostess sat three of us for lunch at a table for four with one other patron who was just paying his bill
It was rudely obvious that they were trying to push him out as soon as possible
The important word was RUDELY! The bus boys simply stopped refilling my water once I was finished with my food
The food is good and the prices are definitely worth the value but EAT AND LEAVE! Good Luck
My friends and I picked this as a convenient sitdown place that isn't too expensive
The menu is pretty decently price, and the service is fast and friendly
However, the food, while fresh and nicely prepared, really lacked deeper flavor that's so fundamental in many of the dishes they try to make
In other words, food is fresh but bland
The drinks were pretty good though
I would probably come back in the future for quick drink but nothing substantial
The food is acceptable, though the noise level when it's crowded is second only to Gonzo in the West Village--don't go there with quiet friends!  But the seater had a major attitude problem
I went to the restroom and when I came back and sat down, the seater accused me of having switched seats, and to move because he needed to seat more people
I told him that HE had seated me here
He said I was lying and that I'd switched seats
He kept telling me to move until I started ignoring him
Bad service is pretty common, but this was a new low even for New York
I'm not going back to Republic; if I wanted to deal with this sort of garbage, I'd go back to my old job
Once you get beyond the somewhat moody hostess, service is great! Having one of the tropical mixed drinks while you wait is a big help
I second the last review - I love the pork chops/rice and appetizers, like the salmon!
Republic is geared for NYU students and there's a reason why there are benches - they don't want you to get too comfy
Still, food is good and prices are very reasonable
Love their pork chops on rice and salmon sashimi
Gets noisy and wait could be long during peak times
Try the chicken udon! I have seen too many people pass on this dish because the waitstaff warns them about it (the spinach sauce turns everything green) but you are missing out if you haven't tried it
This dish is the only food I get a craving for
Overall Republic is a great noodle place with great food, low prices, and a fun scene
I make a point to eat here frequently, and I always bring out-of-town guests here for a good cheap meal
The food here was actually not too bad
The vibe was mostly pretentious and hipster oriented
If that's your thing then go for it
You WILL end up having to share a table with another couple or group of people
It's called Republic for a reason
If you don't dig on the idea of sharing a table with strangers then pass this place up
Republic is trendy
Republic is loud
Republic can is inexpensive
Lots of bang for your buck
However, if you sit inside, the noise and the music are too loud and prohibit you from having a good conversation
Not good for a first date or a business engagement
Great for light-hearted, carefree times and drinks with friends
If you're on a limited budget, the place can be a good luxury
If you are willing to spend more, there are better, quieter Asian fusion restaurants
I've been to many noodle-bar restaurants and the one I've enjoyed the most to date in America is Republic
Their food is great, service is simple and fast and the bar is well-stocked and service is flash if not fast and middle of the road when it comes to drinks
That said, if they were trying to emulate a noodle-bar place, they should have sent someone over on London and spend a few days in Wagamama
They do it RIGHT
Sorry, Republic, but you come oh so close
I'm not one to have cravings for certains foods, as I find all food a fun experience
But I have actual had MAJOR cravings for Republic's glass noodles
Maybe it's the fresh flavor, maybe it's the $8 price tag
but whatever it is, it one of my favs!
The restaurant servers were great! Nice people
But nothing on the menu indicated that there would be a problem for a vegetarian such as myself
I checked with the server, as I usually do, and there is fish sauce in EVERYTHING
Not one vegetarian dish
I'm sure it's a great place for meat eaters but not for vegetarians!
Though some of the items on the menu aren't as great as others, this is still my favorite Union Square restaurant
I've taken to going there every Monday after a long day of work for the fabulous wontons and the absolutely amazing seared salmon and rice, definitely give them a try!
This place has wonderful food for the right price! You must try the Glass Noodles!
Given the prices in the city, this place is worth a look if you are hunting for a cheap meal in a somewhat funky yet social setting
Service is patchy in true NYC style - I don't know why we must tip for bad service - but you don't come here expecting fine dining
Slurp your soup and Sapporo and head out to Union Square or graba beer at the brewery next door
I have only what thing to say about this place: What? I can't hear you

dinner quality entree
Service was a little annoying as they try to push all of the souvenir stuff on you and don't pay much attention to anything else
Must be fun for kids at least as they tend not care as much about food quality
The atmosphere was great, the eccentric characters who interacted with me and my kids were very entertaining and funny
The food was delicious, and the fact that they let you roam around all 4 floors--each with a different theme-- allowed my kids to have a great time
They're still talking about it a month later! This is a must see place
We heard so much about thhe Jekyll and Hyde Club we had to have dinner their last night before going to the theatre with our kids
The decor and artifacts on each floor really makes this palce so unique
The food was excellent
The Salmon was fresh and the ribeye steak was scrumptous
The kids really enjoyed their food and the value on the kids menu is good
If you are taking your family out to dinner and want some excitement added to your experience this is the place to go
I can't wait to go back with the rest of my family
The service at JH is wretched and pretentious
The food is from the freezer and not fresh
The atmosphere is cute, but the poorly-trained children running under your legs while you eat ruins even the best efforts
We have been here several times at the request of the kids and, each time, leave fealing frustrated and ripped off
I had the best time
Its like a wild ride
cool shows and special effects like Disney
Food was great and really big portions
I can not wait to go back!
My family and I went to Jekyll and Hyde restaurant Yesterday and had a blast
It was my brothers 19th birthday
The service and food were great
The large statue Zeus sang Happy B-day to my brother
The club members who come around and talk to the tables were interesting and had all us laughing hysterically
This is one of the most unique restaurants we have ever seen
Check out the fourth floor when you visit
The clown came to life and scared the pants off my brother!
My family and I visited the restaurant for the very first time on May 14th
We had always heard about the place, but never made the trip
It was actuallly fun
It was a lot different from other themed restaurants
I actually prefer this over Planet Hollywood and Hard Rock
There was so much going on around us
The food wasn't bad as well
I had the ribs, which were huge
We definitely recommend this place, especially if you've never tried it before
This is the most amazing place I have ever been
The food was great, the service was great, but the best thing was interior decoration and the entertainment
They had incredible special effects and all these characters walking around like an English Butler and cooky inventors
We had the best time
The things on the walls come to life and talk to you
You never know what is going to happen next
This is something you have to do when you come to the city
The REAL Horror here is the fact that they charge you a $2
50 entertainment fee PER person AND that they DO NOT accept VISA or MASTERCARD!! They don't tell you about the cc problem till you are just about to order
I had the rib eye, which tasted like a well grilled shoe by the way
And I had to borrow cash from a friend
If not being able to pay with YOUR OWN card and people coming up to you and whimpering and screaming is your thing, this is the place for you
Had seen this place on past visits to New York, and finally decided to go here on first night of our stay
We arrived at 5:30 on a Sunday to a huge 30-minute queue
The place doesn't take bookings (unless a large group) but guess they don't have to
The decor is great and the place really is aimed at kids
If I was a kid, I'd think the place excellent! The kids around us all loved it
Food was fine, drinks fine, service was average
Try and not get stuck on the top floor as you'll miss the larger live shows downstairs, though to be fair they do have some entertainment upstairs which the kids loved
It's good for what it is, just don't be under any illusions what to expect when you go there!
I was preparing to go on a blind date and my friend suggested I take them here
I had never been before and wasn't exactly impressed
It defiantly was not a date place
It was too noisy and dramatic, every time we wanted to talk another performance would begin
I didn't completely dislike the restaurant
The food was very good and the service was friendly
The bling date eventually became my husband and now that we no longer have first date jitters we would like to go back
It's a better place for friends to hang out than to take dates
This is the most unique restaurant ever
I had such a blast
The entertainment was wonderful and exciting
The staff was attentive and the food and drinks were delicious for a reasonable price
I will be back often
There is no other restaurant like it and it was worth it
This was the worst restaurant experience ever
Had to wait 1 hour for a table to have cold, undercooked, over-priced food
Did not have half of the drinks listed on the menu available
Horrible and rude staff
The entertainment made it even more deplorable
They over charged us on our bill and were not apologetic AT ALL
Thank you for ruining my friends birthday
How do you stay in business?
I went to Jekyll Hyde for my friend's birthday
We tried making reservations beforehand, but since we only had a party of ten, we were told reservations were not needed and that we should go on ahead to the restaurant
We arrived there at 8 pm, and the doorman informed us that the restaurant was closed, which didn't make sense since the restaurant does not close till 12 am
He refused to explain, and then finally said lamely that they suddenly had a party show up at the restaurant
He refused to service us, and when I asked to speak to the manager, he said, No! He wouldn't even go inside the restaurant to ask for the manager
I had planned to go specifically to that restaurant for my friend's birthday
I will never try to go here again!!!!
I'm quite impressed
Sure, there was a wait to get into the place, but it was worth it
If a place in this city doesn't have a wait on a weekend then it can't be all that good
There were little shows at the bar as well while we waited
The service was not bad at all
We had a very nice and entertaining waitress who was very much on top of our table
The entertainment was very good too
It seems to be a great place to bring kids, but still we had a great time without them
Although the prices is a bit on the high, you do get big portions for it
I definitely recommend this place for birthdays and just for fun when you are tired of the same old restaurants
There isn't a place like it in this city
This is an expensive place for the kind of food that you are getting

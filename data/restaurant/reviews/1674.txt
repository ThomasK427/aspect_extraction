He said it would be 15 minutes
I looked around and there were at least 9 empty tables, so I asked what about all the empty tables
He said, in the snottiest voive ever- Those tables are empty for a reason
If he would have said they were reserved or gave me a reason, I would have understood, but he was outright obnoxious
We left immideately and ate at Barca which was very good
After seeing the constant long lines outside this place, I decided to bear the long wait and try it out for brunch
The food was decent
But what really shaped my opinion of Coffee Shop was the service -- it was awful! The hostess was miserable, but once we (finally) met our waitress, the hostess seemed like a doll
Our waitress was never around, took forever to take our order, bring out our drinks, our food, our check, and was just not a pleasant human being
I would never go back here again -- don't believe the hype!
My friends and I were having a lovely evening and decided to head over to the Coffee Shop for some drinks
When we first arrive, the bouncer checking ID's is very over-bearing, I understand that is partially his job but he was just forceful
2nd, our waitress was ok, not very friendly and acted as if she was miserable
We just had salads and desserts for food which were fine but over all, I did not enjoy this place and would not go back
I came here on a date and simply hated it
Quite honestly they try to mix different ethnicities that will sound appealing to the cool NY crowd, but it just does not work
Being brazilian i was disgusted to see their version of moqueca, cheese bread and others on the menu
Not only was the food BAD, but the service was poor and the ambience reminded me more of a retro 50's dinner than a trendy NY restaurant
i would not recommend this place to anyone
This place has THE WORST service of any restaurant I have visited in the past year
Its as if the management advertizes for lazy or stupid when it needs a new waitress
I've visited three times (I must be a glutton for punishment), and each time it was the same
Horrible
All that said, they have a GREAT Ceasar salad (well
ok
it arrived after the entree)
Skip this place
If it was ever the hot trendy place to go, that time passed during the Clinton administration
This may sound odd, but me (25 y/o male model) and two of my other pals were placed way ahead of everyone and seated in primo location
But, I found that to be very rude
I expect that at a NICE RESTARUANT or even the RESTAURANT DU JOUR but at this place, I don't want to be treated like that
It is an 'OVER' restaurant; however, someone forgot to tell the staff
Come on, coffee shop, don't treat a pseudo celeb like a star at your mediocer diner
It is degrading and doesn't speak very highly of yourself
Oh, and servers, you have the right attitiude to work at a happining place
And I like that, but take your resumes and put them to good use at a better joint
This place is over
Peace
I recently went to Coffee Shop with three friends for a late Saturday night dinner
The hostess walked us past several empty tables to seat us in the very back of the restaurant, immediately next to the kitchen and the area where the hipper-than-thou waitstaff all stand around together
We asked about the tables near the front and were told that they were all reserved
Reserved? At one in the morning?, we asked
Reserved, she said, tossing our menus on the table and huffing away with an attitude
Mysteriously, the reserved tables all stayed empty throughout our meal and were still empty when we left an hour later
Who did they expect to suddenly arrive on the scene? Britney? Madonna? Gene Wilder? To appease imaginary celebrities, Coffee Shop offended and lost four good customers
Although the food and drinks were quite good, I wont spend money at Coffee Shop again
I love the coffee shop - great location, good food and drinks, cheap, good people watching
People that are expecting gourmet cuisine and excellent service should not go to a place called 'coffee shop
' From the second you walk in the place, it's obvious that the staff are all models or ex-models, so what do you expect? If you want to relax and have fun, it's a great place to go
I have never been treated so rudely by a waitress
After waiting for water for five minutes we asked again if we could please have some water
She came back (without our waters) and said very rudely that it was not her fault our waters took so long , the computers were down
Since when does it take a computer to pour a glass of water? I felt like I was in elementary school getting yelled at by a teacher!
I love the Coffee Shop
This is the quintessential NY experience
The place is always jammed, even at three a
m
The staff looks like they are out of a broadway showthink Rent
The food is really quite tasty, the music is hip
I go for lunch as I work in the neighborhood
It's always good, although it is sometimes hard to get seated right away
The staff are nice and hip
Definately a place to take someone who wants to see a cool ny scene
I recommend
I found my last 2 visits here to be very satisfying
When friends and I approached the Host last nite, he was very accomodating and offered us immediate seating when we politely asked for availability
The next visit was just as nice
We were going to wait for a seat and was pleasantly surprised when we got seated in a couple of minutes
What a great Host! In addition, we all enjoyed our food (esp
the french fries chicken sate) and found our waitresses to be very attentive
We'll be back again! :)
Generally agree with Citysearch review except that our waitress was wonderful! Been going to Coffee Shop on occasion since around 1989
Winding through the usual suspects milling about, had a nice drink from friendly bartender with small group of friends
Cut to the chase: flagrantly rude and just plain nasty host
We had reservations weren't pushy but poor thing is still looking, I guess, for his big break that never came
Even the co-hostess spontaneously apologized
Since there are many other similar, fun places around NYC, think twice about going to Coffee Shop unless you like that sort of thing
How could it go from bad to worst? Totally dissatisfied with service food
Should get a decent group of knowledgable servers
Will never neither go back nor recommend my friends this place
Come for the cheese fries, leave for the HORRIBLE service
As much as I hate this place, I can't stay away from those chees fries!!! They are unbelievable
The service is so bad and the attitude so ridiculous, it's humorous
There was an entire empty section, the hostess made our party of 3 wait 20 minutes to sit in an already empty table!!! Are you kidding!
The staff may look good, but their looks don't make up for what they lack in the brain department
I have been there two times and both times I have been shocked by the level of ineptitude displayed by the staff
This place is got the WORST ATTITUDE, the staff thinks they are hot, when they are really NOT ALL THAT ( in fact our bartender was kind of ugly and weird
)We had to deal with a SNOTTY HOSTESS, AIRHEADED WAITRESSES and the list goes on and on
The food is no better than a diner's and the place is kind of dingy, please save yourself a headache and go spend your money somewhere else
CAFETERIA is also open 24 hours and is got much better food and attitude
Oh, yeah I heard the owners used to be models or something
that explains it all!
Having heard about the supposedly hot staff there I brought a group of friends over for drinks last Friday
Needless to say our dissapointment made us leave after the first round when the bartender,(who wasnt exacly a model type) not satisfyed with his tip keep giving us dirty looks
We went in there expecting beautiful women and all we got was attitude from some guy that looks like he came from some grunge band
Not exacly our idea of fun
What I really dislike about this place is that they seat you based on your appearance, your looks, the way you dress - you get the idea
Although it serves food late and is in a good location, I prefer not to go there for that reason - it's just not right
The waitstaff is awful and and completely incompetent
I asked one waitress if I could change tables and she didn't say no outright

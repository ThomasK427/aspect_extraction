S army and was based in the U
K for six years I would say I have a little knowledge of British food
As a party of four we sampled one anothers food, the mash on the Sheperds Pie was as sloppy as a 7 eleven slurpy, but with out the flavor, the Steak Kidney had very little steak and the Treacle Pudding was as dry as Mummies under garments
Overall an over rated second to Greenwich village's Tea sympathy and A Salt Battery!
We had fish chips and SHepherd's pie
All the nosh was great (I'm a brit so I can tell you it's alot better than you'd find in most places in the UK!)
Pleasant, friendly atmosphere and refreshing decor
As a fish salesman I was very dissapointed when I ordered the Cod and my partner ordered the Rock salmon only to find that both fish were in fact the same and not any of the fish that I ordered! My inspection of the fish, both in texture, taste and color I would be confident in saying they were both Hake
If your going to sell variants of fish, it's a really good idea to stock that kind of fish, just a suggestion! The music was too loud and the waitress was very abrupt when questioned about the fish
A real dissapointment
Came across this in Park Slope
More Brit ambience than A Salt Battery
FIsh N Chips were non-greasy and quite delicious
Better than most of what I have tasted in London
Fried mars bar was surprisingly better than I expected
A very light, non greasy batter coated a gooey-chocolatey-nougaty bar that isn't cloying or strange at the very least
Not something I would eat all the time, but deserves more credit than the butt of jokes it is
Or maybe Chip Shop does it justice? For a culture that fries everything from hot dogs to cheese sticks, Americans shouldn't be so hasty to point fingers and make fun


love the food and the music
chris sell, the owner,
is great
Better than in the Punjab
Highly recommended lighter fare to help save room for some deep fried chocolate!
The best fish chip i've ever eaten! I tried loads of times in London always been dissapointed not even close to Chipshop
The prices were reasonable a great selection of unusual British beers
It seems this place is trying to survive off its gimmick
There are SO many better places to eat in Park Slope
The quality of food is okay, BUT be careful: portions of most of the dishes are tiny and extremely overpriced
If you MUST eat there, stick with the basics: fish and chips or chicken and chips
the ginger beer is weak and the shepherd's pie is the size of a pudding cup
(Incidentally, this review is being written by a 100 lb
woman
) The delivery service is the worst ever
Two dishes ordered from 5 blocks away taking an hour and 15 minutes on a Sunday night, with no apology offered? The service stinks
The fish cakes are the best
The service is friendly
The punk rock decor is great
A splendid oasis for anglophiles and homesick Brits
In Short As Quintessence might have you believe, it serves the closest thing to miracle food since the Communion wafer
The menu promises "ultimate healing power" in vegan dishes made of ingredients like hi-alkaline filtered water and mineral-packed sea salt
It's uncooked, unprocessed and unpasteurized
Dishes include Peter's Pot, a soup of tomato, yellow pepper and cucumber
Other favorites are the nut loaf, topped with creamy mushroom gravy, and Juliano's Livioli, a turnip stuffed with a rich basil-and-nut filling
Ok
I'm not a vegetarian but if I could eat here everyday - I would be converted
I am AMAZED at what this place can do to not just to vegetarian food, but to RAW vegetarian food! I've tried everything on the menu and yes, it's expensive - but I must say - everything was fantastic - AMAZING
If I lived closer and could go here everyday I'd be living a RAW vegan lifestyle
My only complaint is that they don't have more locations
The salads are wonderful
I've asked the owner how he makes them but he won't reveal the secret sauce he uses
He actually recommends using the dressing as a facial
Go figure
As a raw foodist, I was very happy to come across a restaurant where I could try something different besides a salad
While I would only go to Quintessence very occasionally (some choices can be quite filling and heavy), the food is very innovative and an amazing display of what can be done without the use of stoves and ovens
While the choices are meant to recreate different types of cooked food, to me the raw versions are completely different and stand deliciously on their own
My only complaint is that sometimes the food can be heavily seasoned, but then again most cooked food is heavily seasoned too
Also, the restaurant is very small, but in a way that makes it cozy
Everything is delicious, but make sure to try the coconut shake!
I am most definitely not a vegeterian but I love this restaurant
I always leave feeling satisfied and not too full
The desserts are my favorites, the 3 layer choclate cake, the apple pie and coconut pie
If you're going the first time get the sample appetizer to get a taste of the variety
They use to serve a great lemonade
Service always seems a bit frazzled but they're very nice
Vegtables RULE! (almost as much as pork fat) I began with a sampler platter of vegan nori rolls and the veggie burrito
Followed by a Mexican platter that featured nut loaf meat with Mexican spices on a bed of romaine with a generous helping of guacamole, refried beans and a side of garlic black rice (it wasn't cooked but the texture was like al dente pasta)
Afterwards, pecan pie with whipped cream (tasted like heavy whipped cream but was actually coconut and stevia extract)
I cannot describe the intensity or complexity of the flavors
The creators of these dishes have achieved nothing less than culinary alchemy, taking the most humble of ingredients and forming tastes that are more than the sum of their parts
The food was presented beautifully and the service was easygoing and attentive
I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants to experience RAW cuisine for themselves
I visited the UES branch and was amazed at the taste and quality of the food
The atmosphere was serene, the staff friendly, the food so good it makes me want to go RAW
The soup was flavorful and heated me up from the inside out with its spiciness
The avacodo/olive dim sum were wondeful drops of richness
My only complaint was that the juicer was noisy in such a small space
The restaurant itself was very beautiful
Peaceful, serene, feng shuied perfectly
The food however, was not amazing
It was very salty
I think that for a strict raw foodist however, the food would be pretty good
The recipes were interested
I ordered the Sesame sea salad which was amazing
I shared my friends Peter's Pot soup and it was very good too
Every meal comes with hot ginger tea which is nice on the stomache
For the main course, I ordered the burrito dinner and my companion ordered the nut loaf, which is like meatloaf made out of nuts-- that was very salty
So salty in fact that it was inedible
In fact, I found all the food to be too salty
The combinations were interesting and they did a good job of combining raw food, but hard rice-- PLEASE!!!! Might be better in summer when you want cold food
I am not a vegan nor a raw foodist, but this place blew me away
The burrito was one of the most flavoral things I've ever eaten, and the coconut cream pie was light and earthy without being dowdy
The bean dim sum was a bite-sized burst of rich flavor
The place is small, the staff is nice and anyone interested in sampling some of the best vegan food in town should check this out
I went to the new location on the upper east side and my frienda nd I were unable to eat our meals
We both took one bite of mush and then decided to ask for the check and leave
We had noticed that the waiter seemed like a nervous fellow--probably b/c he takes a lot of abuse
I am not a vegetarian, so my tollerance for mush is low
However, they served a lot of over-salted, disgusting mush

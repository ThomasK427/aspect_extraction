All the food was very good and very reasonable in price
The place was very crowded for 6pm on a Saturday night, the service was very slow and the place was very warm
I would recommend this place if you are looking for good food and a fair price
They have the best italian food in the city! Large delicious portions at great prices, how can anyone resist? The service is extremely nice
It does get crowded when there are tons of loyal customers, but worth it for the best food!
Two years ago, we went to this restaurant for two friends' birthday dinner
Friendly waiters helped us cutting two hard ice cream cakes without any extra charge
Because of their friendly waiters and tasty mushroom apetizer, we decided to revisit the restaurant two years later
The service was superb as old time
The mushroom apetizer still the best
In addition, house salad comes for free with any entree dish
It's not one of those plain lettuce and tomato with italian dressing
It's a full dish of mixed greens with their house made balsmic vinegrette dressing, which is never enough for salad lovers like myself
The dinner lasted about 3 hours, that waiter continued to refill our water even though we finished the whole meal(including desserts) an hour and half before
Other restaurants would've rushed us out of the door
It was a GREAT dinner
The only bad thing about this place is that it is a small place, otherwise great Italian food and the prices are incredibly cheap for the price
I have been frequenting Fagiolini for over 15 years and it is easily the best italian restaurant in nyc in this price range
The outside is adorable (painted with stringbeans) and the inside is warm cozy with amber walls antique italian posters
The food is to die for and I have tried every item over the last 15 yrs
The prices are absurdly low and I guesss that explains why it is always busy
Service is efficient friendly
You will not believe the value you receive at this place
We brought a group of 15 people from a meeting here for dinner on a Thursday - the staff was extremely accomodating and prepared dinner for a late-arrival in a matter of 2-3 minutes
Very affordable, as well
I went in for a casual Sunday night dinner with a few friends and left annoyed and baffled by the experience
The food was average at best
The service was s-l-o-w
And our one very ordinary and simple request was denied for no other reason than Nope
House-rules
The place is run and managed by a bunch of clowns
And rude ones at that
I will definitely never go back and neither should you
We have eaten here several times, as it is in our neighborhood and has an EXCELLENT dinner special
Today we waited 20 min
to be seated, 15 min
to order, 20 min
for an appetizer, 15 min
for a salad, and 20 min
for dinner
The waitress, host, and bus staff were sitting around at the bar while the patrons were all complaining about the service
and the restaurant wasn't even filled! Our dinner special included dessert, but our slow and unhelpful waitress didn't bother asking if we wanted any
I will go back only because the food is incredible and extremely well-valued, but as for the waiters and staff
I hope you have a fall-back career plan
Nothing terribly bad to say about it
Decent, affordable food, but a little heavy handed with the seasoning sometimes
Clean enough, conscientious staff
You won't be wowed, be you'll be satisfied
Very narrow spaces divided by a wall, which makes for cozy dining
In Short Many Murray Hill locals gladly overlook the dull green walls and fluorescent lighting for Jaiya's quick and affordable Thai cooking--if not, they take meals to go or get them delivered
The lengthy menu includes the likes of mee krob (glass noodles with shrimp, chicken and pork in plum sauce), nur-yang-num-tok (barbecued flank steak served with a spicy sauce), pork with chili and basil leaves and spicy, bean curd coconut milk soup
My hubby i both love thai food, maybe becoz its close to indian, we always go to jaiya for thai food, as they really have grreata food
The service is not bad and the ambience is okay too, but the offd
Its the best thai food in town
gotta give them that
we stopped by to eat here after a movie
it seemed to be a neighbourhood type of place so i wasnt expecting much
we ordered pad thai ($10) and their fish special ($25)
the pad thai was average i thought that it lacked flavour and was a little dry
the fish turned out to be deep fried red snapper in a peanutty coconut red curry
i thought that it was too heavy for the hot summer day
it was also pretty spicy, even though we had asked for mild spice
apparently you can specify different degrees of spiciness for each dish on the menu
overall, i thought the food was really average, so im not too eager to come back
i did read some reviews posted on their door about their noteworthy seafood soup, so ill probably try that if i do return
As good as the original in Queens
very spicy
great quality
staff gracious, friendly
most customers are Thai
I have loved Jaiya for over 5 years and have eaten there countless times
But sadly, they have suddenly gone dramatically downhill recently
The last three times I've eaten there (I often get the same dish) I've noticed the portions have been cut in HALF -- same price though
Also the dish I often get that has Thai basil in it -- the basil they are using is black, charred-looking and totally tasteless
It is supposed to be green and flavorful! I live very near Jaiya, LOVE Thai, and have given them a ton of business over the years, but now I'm done with this place
Three strikes and they are out
I hope they get it together again some day
Once we got seated after half-hour, the service from was appalling
When one of us asked for eggs to be added to an order of vegetable pad-thai, the waiter responded with a lecture on how, and I quote,
eggs come from chicken, so (how they are) not vegeterian
My wife didn't even get what she ordered - when she told the waiter about it, the response was that he forgot?! The ginger ale -- based on what he gave me, it was more like I ordered ginger ale on the rocks! At the end of it all, I had a waiter yelling at me for the minimum tip that I gave him
Almost spitting in my face, he told me that he will remember my face and not invite me in again
Good thing he is going to remember my face - because I am never going to this restaurant!
For years this has been our place to go for reliably spicy good Thai food
This past year, however, the service was slow or absent, the wrong dishes were delivered or delivered in the wrong order, and the spice has disappeared
What a disappointment
Sorry, but this place has gone down in quality
We put up with the poor service in exchange for great Thai food, but that is no longer
Also, a group larger than 4 people seems to really challenge their wait staff
We've never had a good experiece with a large group
If you go, the crab fried rice is dynamite and the laab nur is delicious
Be prepared for friendly but slow and forgetful service, and don't expect the spice level to be anywhere near authentic
My main complaint is that the food was terrible! I ordered the green curry chicken (2/1/05) and it did not taste like green curry I have ever had at a Thai restaurant
There was no coconut milk in it, instead it was greasy and spicy, those were the only two flavors
Everyone in my party had disgusting food
I agree with the other reviews that the service was awful, once we were seated we had to wave down a waiter every time we needed any sort of service, otherwise they would ignore us completely
On top of everything else it was expensive! With all the great Thai food in New York City I would never go here again and recommend no one else go there either!
The food, I would say, is very good, though a bit pricey compared to neighboring restaurants
The service, however is EXTREMELY BAD
People who work there have no people skills whatsoever

My date's pulled pork was cold and, according to her, so terrible that she couldn't eat it
The dessert, a slice of chocolate pie, was good
The waitress did not return for 20 or more, so admittedly, we did not complain about the quality of the food
And when she did return, she did not ask us if we were enjoying the meal
I don't mind spending money if the food is good, but for $75 I expect my food hot and tasty
Everything about the dining experience was pleasant
The barbeque was particularly good for New York and the sides such as baked beans and collard greens were excellent
They do special things for the children and are definitely worth a trip!
My friend took me to this restaurant, because we thought it would be a kid friendly restaurant with great food
We were WRONG
It has too much Bar atomosphere for my liking to bring kids, although wait stuff was nice, there was a cool toy for kids to play while waiting, and kids' menu
Food was dry, and it tasted like they were sitting around way too long, and was just warmed up on the grill
You can get better ribs easily elsewhere
If the taste is what matters to you, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant
Blue Smoke has the best burger in Manhattan, period
Obviously a bit pricier than Corner Bistro, but worth every penny
The mac and cheese, chicken wings, and hush puppies are also excellent
The ribs are a bit on the pricey side, but also very good
15-17 dollars for half a rib? YIKES!!!! Well, my friends ordered ribs, and I tried some
They were ok, but not worth the price
And you have to paid extra for side dishes
You just get the ribs
As for me, I made a big mistake having the chicken dish w/ mash potatoes
Magically, the chicken was undercooked inside (stilll red), while the other part was very dry
YUCK!  As for ambience, make sure you bring ear plugs
If you want good ribs, go to Dallas BBQ
Shame on you, Mr
Meyer
Blue Smoke is a good place for BBQ but I think the ribs were a little dry and lacking meat for my taste
I was very impressed with the service, side dishes and the drinks (try the blood red margarita)
Prices were not overly expensive (meal for 2 was $60) Overall a good restaurant but not the best in the city
This is one of the only real smokehouses in Manhattan
When the other places say BBQ, they usually just mean grilled and drenched in some kind of BBQ sauce
This place has fabulous smoked food! mmmmm
My boyfriend's parents were in from Texas and loved it! The last time I came to this restaurant, however, they refused to seat my part of six until all the individuals arrived
Despite the fact that it was the day before Mother's Day and I had my 78 year old grandmother with me!!! It is a bit of a tourist trap with extremely rude hostesses (but accomodating managers that go out of their way for you)
This place has a lively atmosphere with fantastic ribs, pulled pork and desserts
Not the cheapest BBQ, but certaintly one of the best
Be careful, the catfish was not so good
Great BBQ! Went for restaurant week and they had a menu designed perfectly for sharing and sampling
We had the smoked oysters (divine) deviled eggs (ok but a little crunchy- shell?) Kansas City Ribs, Apple Smoked Chicken- both deliciously seasoned- ribs fell of the bone but weren't too messy and the banana cream pie and bread pudding! The bread pudding was the best I have ever had- perfect combo of custard and cinammon with a little caramel flavor
Service was well timed- just enough time between courses to prepare for the next round without feeling stuffed or rushed
Was told this was a cool place with great food and service
Fun atmosphere, good beer selection, but meals were skimpy portions on big plates and the service was weak - never had the same server/waitperson come back twice
Had the pear/cranberry pie for dessert and it looked fresh out of a can
Wouldn't go back here for the food - possibly for drinks, but that's it
Went for lunch and loved it
I had the pulled pork barbecue sandwich and thought it was fantastic - and I'm from North Carolina and hence not easy to please
you can have a good meal here
I only order the ribs (Memphis or St
Louis), select sides (stay away from the mac and cheese
watery stuff the last three times I tried it), and two or three consistent appetizers (the sausage sampler is quite good)
Don't forget the beer
Besides, who goes to a BBQ joint to order foie gras?? Sometimes the ribs can be dry
Service needs a lot of work
They can be forgetful and some look very stressed
If you order wine, take care to read the label to make sure you're getting the right stuff
On two occasions, the waitstaff tried to present bottles that weren't what I ordered and were much more expensive
Seems like a lot of the reviewers were expecting Blue Smoke's BBQ to produce some sort of orgasmic reaction
it's just BBQ
if you want fancy food, go to Daniel or something
For what it is, this BBQ is outstanding
I was born and raised in Texas, and this BBQ is tender and flavorful by any standards
I tried the brisket (lean), the Rhapsody in 'Cue, fried oyster salad, hushpuppies, and key lime pie
ALL excellent
Couldn't be happier b/c I've been searching for a good BBQ place for years here, and this place is definitely it
Sure, it's a bit pricey when compared to what I can get in TX, but it's Manhattan
totally expected
Service was just okay
but I think that had more to do with our waiter than the service in gen'l
Blue Smoke does have the greatest ribs along with their great side dishes such as mac n cheese, hush puppies, cauliflower and potato gratin, and their barbequed mussels (this is awesome by the way!)
Also, what also impressed me was their beer selection
They have some great beer at this place
they even have paulaner
and some great cocktails for the ladies
our server was really nice and knowledgable
oh yeah
did i mention their ribs are the best in the city? Definitely a must-go but make sure you make reservations in advance
Went to Blue Smoke last night and really enjoyed it
Bit disappointed with our particular waiter as we've dined at Danny Meyers restaurants in the past and have been very impressed with the waitstaff on every other occasion
Pulled pork sandwich was dry, but the beef ribs were fantastic
After sampling the delicious homemade (and warm) BBQ chips, the Fried Oyster salad and fry bread led us into our entrees with a smile
Like Cajun food and Tex-Mex, BBQ never tastes quite as good outside of the South, but Blue Smoke's baby back ribs and brisket were passable
What I really liked, though, were the homemade BBQ potato chips (to die for!), the devilled eggs (almost ruined by the added curry flavor) and the deserts
The brownie with chocolate sauce was wonderful, as was the Key Lime Pie
On the downside, I'd skip the Mac Cheese
It tasted like someone had thrown in a few handfuls of onions
The service was very efficient and, even on a packed Friday night, the waiters, hosts, and bartenders were all very friendly
I also liked the crowd here
Hip, but unpretentious
Better and a little classier than Virgil's (which, as a Southern girl, I never liked anyway)
Blue Smoke has different types of 'cue, so that you can see that BBQ doesn't mean drowning in sauce like it can up here
The fresh watermelon and deviled eggs are a great touch
Beware the rug rats that come here - it's very kid-friendly
Have been to a handful of BBQ/Southern food places in the city - this was the bougie version of southern BBQ
It was way too salty, my party and I all agreed, and I have heard this from people who have eaten there before
Service was great though, and the beer was good too (nice frosty mug)
special evening with a special friend,atmosphere was great staff attentive
good food and service would recommend to my friends here in california to visit blue smoke when they are in new york
Like any of Danny Meyer's restaurants, Blue Smoke offers good, attentive service and you'll get your money's worth from a visit

The calamara appetizer was just ok and was the one dish that was a little disappointing
However the homemade doughnuts was the killer dish--not too sweet and absolutely delish
The service was attentive and helpful
The only thing my dining partner and I didn't care for is the space
The food, service and name suggests something intimate and cozy but the space is loud and a little sterile
This place was spectacular
We went with nine people and were unbelievably accommodated
Ask for wine suggestions- you'll be glad you did
The service is impeccable and the food is to die for
I eat out in New York quite often and I was very impressed with Hearth's ambience and especially the food
Be sure to try any or ALL of the desserts
The calamari is just okay, but the duck is to die for
Be sure to make a reservation, as the word has spread about this place quickly!
My wife and I went down on a cold Jan night and just walked in thinking to get a table
Wrong
but we sat at the bar and had a wonderful experience
The service was great, attention fabulous, food divine, advice on wine-outstanding with a great result in something we would never had tried
The food was well balanced, with something for everyone
(try the mini donuts!) However, the acoustic of the space was horrible
The layout of the restaurant was that of a larger, mega-restaurant, but without high ceilings to absorb the noise
I could hear the conversations from the opposite end of the restaurant! Recommende for loud diners, not so much if you are looking for something more intimate
The service and execution was excellent by any measure and is all the more noteworthy when considering that the restaurant is so young
Delicious and well though out ingredient driven preparations which echo but do not mimick Craft
A winelist that is daring and inspired (but challenging)
Desserts to kill for, Im thinking specifically of the homemade apple cider donuts
The food is fantastic
The chef has succeeding in bringing together distinct flavors onto on plate
The atmosphere is warm and inviting, trimmed in copper and wood, it is minimalist and chic all at once
Service is great, the staff is incredibly attentive
I would definitely suggest this restaurant to all
There is a distinct energy about the place, the crowd is sophisticated yet casual
I will go back many times
This restaurant looked so quaint on the outside, I was tremendously and happily surprised to find this place not only has great food, fantastic service but the cozy atmosphere of friends
The wait staff were extremely helpful and attentive, I would not change anything
This hidden gem won't stay hidden much longer!
The Scene On a busy stretch of 2nd Avenue, this Italian restaurant slows the world down for locals
An accommodating maitre d' welcomes groups and intimate pairs
The large, comfortable dining room has a simple, upscale touch--red-orange walls refined by white-clothed tables, a sturdy dark wood bar, and French doors that open onto a breezy sidewalk patio in summer
The Food This neighborhood spot serves classic Italian dishes without making a fuss over presentation
Proscuitto-topped arugula, apple and goat cheese salad passes with light lemon-olive oil dressing
Fresh pastas should be favored over the regular pasta selections, which are not homemade
The ricotta-stuffed ravioli di astago melds nicely with its diced peppers and rich vodka cream sauce
The chicken parmigiana stays crispy beneath a generous layer of mozzarella and thick sauce
See the specials of the day to order dessert: The tower of hazelnut ice cream topped with whipped cream is a treat
My husband and I have been to Cortina several times since moving to this neighborhood
We have enjoyed the consistently good food, pleasant atmosphere, and friendly service
The chicken parm is great! This place is a good neighborhood standby
The grilled portabella appetizer was cold, the calamari had a piece of plastic in it, the swordfish (the special) was overcooked and tasteless
The salad had wilted bits in it and the service was confused and slow
The owner/manager was arrogant
Too bad - it could be fabulous with location and decor
I have been eating at Cortina for at least 10 years, and have consistantly been delighted with the quality of the food and service
Chef Richard is always eager to please, and will be happy make something special 'off the menu' if you ask
My mother-in-law has special needs, and Richard always sees to it that her food is special too! We have had many family parties there, and the staff has made each occassion special
A meal there will certainly not disappoint
I have passed Cortina several times, having lived near it for 10 years
Poor reviews kept me away
Against my better judgment , I decided to try it with a few visiting friends
In brief, the waitstaff was rude and condescending and my friends and I were a bit embarrassed
We sat down for drinks at around 10PM with the possibility of cappuccinos and desert
Instead of being smart business people and treating us as paying customers, we were told they do not serve drinks, only food (only food?)
We promplty left and took our business elsewhere and had a lovely time
at cortina a dish that is probably familiar to anyone who favors Italian cuisine, chicken parmigiana is an extraordinary eating experience, the chicken is sliced thin and tender, lightly encrusted in seasoned bread crumb and moistened by a lirely marinara sauce, a portion of expertly cooked pasta completes our desevedly popular dish
Cortina's presentation of wild striped bass is both aye catching and taste tempting, a fillet of bass a top the grilled zucchini green and red pepper, sliced onions and mushrooms was most appealing, The taste, delicate and flavorful, was even more satisfying
This is an unusually gratifying meal
Don't forget to order the cheesecake, it is the best in town
i ordered a fair sampling of the menu--i was with three people and we chose 2 appetizers, 3 entrees and 2 desserts
the salads were by far sub-par, tasteless and wilting, and the only redeeming pasta dish was the ravioli
it doesn't matter that the ice cream was ok--go to a ice cream shop if you're just looking for dessert
basically, this place is a throw-away
don't bother
I alwasy dine at this romantic place, the food is indredibly consistent and the service is fantastic, (but I never had dessert and trust me they have the best gellato in NYC, so don't miss the pistaccio !!)
The food is excelent and moderately priced, It's quaint and cozy with a very friendly atmosphere
the music selection sets the perfect mood, lowlit candles and lucio dalla is a wonderful atmosphere not only for a romantic dinner, but for a get together with friends and loved ones
the service is extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous
I'd recommend anyone go there for a wonderful dining experience
This quiant, indoor/ outdoor italian restuarant was amazing
From the Baked Clams, to the Salmon, all the way up to the homemade ice cream; my experience at Cortina was amazing
The food was out of control good, and they had a very nice wine selection
Again I recommend the ICE CREAM; Out Of This World!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After reading a review here, we decided to go
While the place was nice enough to look at, the owner/or manager was totally Unfriendly, Obnoxious, Pretentious, Aloof, Condescending
The only way we were able to order was to hand signal the manager
He never stopped at the table to ask us if we needed anything
We waited over an hour for our main courses, and there were only six table occupies in the whole place
Never again
My husband and I live in the area and have walked by this quaint Italian restaurant many times
Our first experience actually eating there was great! It was a weeknight and we were seated immediately- the breadsticks on the table and warm rolls with butter were fabulous, we had a nice bottle of red wine which added to the dimly-lit romance of the place
We had a chicken dish and some pasta and both entrees were yummy
My only regret was the dessert- avoid the crepes and stick with the ice cream
All in all a sweet little place for good Italian food
I have lived on the upper east side all my life, and this restaurant has been on the area since Ronald Reagan was president
Odd thing I had never been there
Went with a few friends last week and I was surprised by the good food
Portions are nice and go according with the prices they charge
The wait staff is not top of the line but they battle, and the result is not something you can point your finger as a bad thing(we left a 20% tip)
I love my desserts
And discovered that Chocolate Mousse at Cortina is made by hand by the Owner! Smooth, creamy fresh, gentle and sexy
Opening the senses to what only the imagination can allow to follow
Absolutely incredible

Went there - their famous sliders are virtually raw
No one said that this is how they are served
Sent them back to the kitchen twice - each time they were increasingly inedible
Staff was rude and could not be bothered
Plus had a hard time trying to find our server
Do not go
Keep shopping or go to another Bloomie's restaurant to refuel
These burgers are overhyped
While the actual tiny burger portion of the three mini sliders is tasty, the bun is gross
The bottom part gets soaked through, thus breaking easily
The fries are mediocre
The service is uneven at best
The staff is constantly disappearing from the restaurant, making it impossible to get drink refills or to get the check
I have never been so tempted to walk out of a place
If you want a good burger, then definitely go elsewhere
Shake Shack, Corner Bistro, The Burger Joint, anywhere else
Our first time to try Sri Lankan foods, and turned out to be the superb experience! I imagined something similr to Indian cuisine, but it was different
especially from some Americanized, just super spicy curry or dry tandoori
All dishes we tried were excellent and their service wes hospitable and very well orgnaized
Very cozy, probably up to 30 or so seating
I'll definitely go back this place and try other dishes
No alcohol drink is served, so bring your own if you need
The food is excellent
It is the best Sri Lankan restaurant I have been to outside Sri Lanka
Even my mother who just got here from SL 3 days ago couldn't believe how good the food was
The service is also a perfect representation of Sri Lankan hospitality
I have take both Sri Lankan friends as well as those who have not had the luck to visit yet (and some who do not eat spicy food)
Everyone loved it
The staff was very accomadating to cater to everyones needs
Since it is not a large place make a reservation if it is for a group
Did a take-out of their lunch special and was very very pleased with the food!
The food is authentic the service is great and it is a little taste of Sri Lanka in New York
TOTALLY SUPERB !!!!
where else in manhattan can you get hoppers?? food is delicious, perfect if you're in the mood for something adventurous
i came with 5 friends and we all loved it
BYOB guarantees for a fun night
it's about time a SL restaurant opened here!
Mix between fantastic and sizzling! Get the Dal extra spicy those guys doe some tricks with it to make you happy
Service was excellent and the Watalappam was ridiculous, like a Ceylonian Po de Creme
Get the pseudo Dosas in excess (aka hoppers)
Sigiri serves excellent Sri Lankan food in a warm friendly environment
The space is tight and the seating a little cramped but the service is cheerful and prompt and the food really makes it worth it
Not only is it authentic (I am Sri Lankan and a pretty good cook in my own right so I can say this with some authority) but attractively served
I recommend the all the appetizers, hoppers, Kothu Roti and Lamprias
I have not tried anything else but plan to go back many more times to do so
Great authentic Sri Lankan food
The restaurent is small and run by a family who provide excellent service with the customary Sri Lankan hospitality
The pol rotti and aappa (hoppers) here are excellent
Good value for money as well
The music was soft and unobtrusive, service was very accomodating
what a quaint, hidden jewel we discovered! we booked the tatami room and it was a nice little area away from the rest of the dining room, it was wonderful
the kisu tempura was delicious! The service is so personalized and proper, it was a nice touch
would like to try the tasting menu next time
I really liked the atmosphere, food is good, bit pricy, good selection of drinks
The less classy part was the elderly waitress manipulating the credit card slip to upgrade her tip
Food-superb
No doubt about it
Its authentic (am southern german, I knwo what authentic in that region tastes like)
tasteful, nicely plated, fresh
the wait staff is very quick on their toes, accommodating at all times
The only complaint I have are the benches
not comfy at all
I have a slipped disk and always stuff my bag before we go to Blaue Gans (to sit on)
;-)
I really had a bad experience in this restaurant
the Food was ok, but the price was SO expensive
125
-USD per personn
for really nothing special and not even trendy
They're a little rushed here on a Friday night, but boy, does the food make up for it
Some delicious fried chicken and great sausage
I'd say to stay away from the shrimp when it's on special (since when is Austria known for its shrimp?) as it was a bit mealy
Be sure to go for the strudel - the lightest flakiest crust yet
Ambience was exactly as it was at Le Zinc - I like it
Yes the space is gorgeous and the food is good, what there is of it
We were a very large party (10) for lunch and whatever pleasant experience could be derived from the interesting menu and inviting decor was quickly dampened by an incredibly slow kitchen and service that was beyond bad
Let's first address the food
Yes, the imaginative menu offered many interesting dishes and some were excellent
Many, unfortunately, were in portions that they should be ashamed of
Enough said
The kiss of death for us came in the form of impolite waiters who made rare visits to the table and looked like they were at a funeral
If you are going to keep people waiting an hour for a lunch entree, then at least be nice
Come over and say, sorry for the delay, is there anything we can get you? More drinks? An appetizer or two on us? Not here
They couldn't care less
Finally, the maitre d' came over and rattled off an apology that came too little too late
And as far as that coffee custard they rave about, it would be nice if it tasted like coffee
How this place will stay in business is Greek to me!
We had a party of 14, seated at the large bar table-- we had a great time, the waitor(S) were so attentive and very personable
The food was hot and promptly brought out all together
The drinks were YUMMY and the decor was very trendy
We were in and out of there within 1hr 45min-- on a Sat
evening! It was perfect! Very pleased!
Skip the rest of the entrees and order anything seafood! The NY Times gave the chicken a good review, honestly, I'm not sure what the reviewer was eating because the chicken was dry and unflavorful
The seafood on the other-hand, everything from the red-snapper to the skate was delicious and GENEROUS in portions
If you're going with less than a big group of people, the banquet seating is plush and gorgeous
Overall, an excellent place to dine!
My boyfriend and I went to Barbounia on Sunday night and ended up waiting quite a while for drinks and water and then our bill due to some sort of computer malfunction
The food was pretty good and we realized later that the only authentic mediterranian and enjoyable part of our experience was the maitre d' who was the only one to come over and check on us as we waited and waited for our food and then our bill
On our way out we caught her name and honestly Maya is the only reason we will return!!
If you believe you have a reservation STOP, think again and add an hour to that time

The atmosphere is much nicer than the outside appears
The food is expensive, but worth every cent! A great place for huge appetizers and monster filet mignon!
The Old Homestead is the best when it comes to steak
Perhaps because of its location it is not known as widely as other steakhouses
But to steak connoisseurs, there are no better cuts and culinary skills than those offered by master chef Ed Gozdz
This place is what you imagine a great steakhouse should be - excellent huge amounts of cow delivered gruffly but with regard
Good wine list too - and not as obscenely expensive as some peers
Outstanding!
I went here for lunch and it was top notch
The shrimp are truly jumbo
Atmosphere is also very nice and pleasant
The steak was cooked perfect
Nothing is worse than a steakhouse which screws up my black and blue steak
It was delicious
The cheese cake was delicious as well
I do like lemon peel with my espresso (which was not provided) but I'll let it slide because the rest of the experience was great
Great food, great wine (DEFINITELY get the David Bruce Petite Syrah!) Real manly steak place- unfortunately I went with women and you sort of feel out of place
Table behind us got terrible service- they dropped a steak and it had already taken a long time coming out- ours was fine but service seems variable at best
Specials are great and worth taking advantage of on the right noghts
Old Homestead has been around forever
I live in the neighborhood and have never had a bad meal or a bad cut of beef here
Their wet and dry aged rib eye is without a doubt the best in the city
Their home fries are crispy and tasty
Yes there are other steakhouses in the city with a bigger name, but Homestead combines great service with good food and comes out a winner
Every steak house has its forte--and the featured cut here is the Prime Rib, which is cut into a slab thick enough to support an apartment building, and runs clear with delicious juices--the medium rare cut a slice of heaven
The chopped salad is outstanding, and the lobsters rivalk what they serve up at S and W and the Palm
Often overlooked, this old standby still can do they job
The only thing you get at this place is the biggest steak you've ever seen and a few days shaved off your life
People that think this place is the best obviously haven't been to any of the top steakhouses (Luger's, Morton's and Sparks)
The steaks here are monstrous, but that isn't enough to substitute for the lack of flavor or the poor cuts
Save your money and spend the dough and the calories in a proper steakhouse
And the steaks in those places are huge anyway
So there's really no reason to come here unless you're looking to fatten up before you head for hogs and heifers
At one time this was a primo steak restaurant, but it now feels like a has-been, overpriced and nowhere near as good as some of the newer places
I'm not sure how many people who live in Manhattan still go to the Old Homestead
the Sherry brothers must get to the butcher district 6 hours after the Luger meat buyers have left
they truly have the worst quality meat of any of the major steakhouses
but if quantity is what you want this is your place
Their steak is good, but it's not the best in NYC; it's of very good quality, but it didn't have US Prime properly dry-aged characteristics
However, prices are prime
The steak was cooked exactly as I specified (black and blue) but it lacked flavor
I've had better steaks at the Chicago Chop House, River Palm Terrace (NJ), Bobby Vans, Luger's, Keens, M
Jordan's, Gallagher's,
Their wine list is narrow and slightly overpriced
Appetizers are pricey, but good
Cooking and environment shouldn't make The Old Homestead the best steakhouse in NYC
People must question themselves on what to look for in steak before claiming such a place has the best steak
I give them credit for being in business for so many years, but I'd much rather spend my hard-earned money at any of the aforementioned places before I go back to the Old Homestead
Huge beefsteak tomatoes for appetizer, filet for main course- both excellent! Seated right away, nice service
A truly terrible service experience
The Old Homestead has deteriorated badly, with service being truly unbearable
Food has also gone downhill
Wrote letter of complaint and never received a reply, and this after a $160 bill for two
Visit Bobby Van's instead
They appreciate your business
My husband and I frequent both Don Giovannis in Manhattan, the 44th Street location and 10th Avenue 23rd
The pizza specials are so good (check out the chalk board above the bar) that I requested my husband take me there for our 5 Year Anniversary - I'm a cheap date, I know!  We always order the special pizza with Feta Cheese, Onions, garlic and Crushed red pepper
It is too die for and puts Patsy's specialty pizzas (also good) to shame!  Also, the eggplant parmigiana - out of this world
We have never had a bad meal - and it's very, very inexpensive
If you are looking for ambience and quality service, you don't go to a Pizza restaurant, ok? (Note sure what some reviewers are thinking!) But if you are looking for great pastas and pizzas and great price - this is it!
I ordered food in 2 opportunities and will not order again
The man who picks up the phone is rude and has a terrible attitude
The food arrived all messed up, pizza topping all over the box and dessert (tiramisu) melt and warm! It took them 45 minutes to get to my place on a weekday and I am only 2 blocks away from them
On the menu says Free delivery (Minimun order $10) but I was charged a couple of dollars on both opportunities
Pizza is average and certainly not worth it the hassle
I dine out several times a week, and have a good experience 95% of the time
I took my mother out for mothers day, but did not like the gummy chicken marsala
A nice waiter (not ours) came over and noticed I was not eating it, asked why - I said it was not very good
He offered to let me order something else, then notified my rude miserable waiter
who then said to pick another dish and took plate away
The manager came over and rudely said I could not order another dish, creating a scene in the restaurant
The rude waiter and manager turned the situation around like I was trying to get a free meal, after 2 of them offered to replace itl! I will never go back
I'm not usually one to complain - at least I try to find something positive in every place
But this was a place I couldn't wait to leave
They have a big sign outside saying Serving brunch NOW, 12-3 p
m
, but didn't bring us a brunch menu until we asked for it
I ordered an omlet with tomato, mozzarella and mushrooms
They bring me a pizza
I say I ordered an omlet, and they argue with me
In the end, they bring me an omlet with tomato and mozzarella without mushrooms
Not a word of apology
Then they have the nerve to charge me the $1 extra for mushrooms I didn't even get
At that point I just wanted to leave
Will NEVER go back! But the coffee was good
I used Don Giovianni for a business lunch and the delivery was on time, piping hot
Highly recommended!
i get delivery of their pizza all the time
nice crispy brick oven crust
clam and bacon pie is different, but awesome
I don't know who that person is that said it's an insult to italians, but the food tastes as close to my italian mom and grandmother's cooking than any other italian restaurant i've been to
The prices are decent and the food is excellent
Service depends on the time you go, but usually we are seated promptly and taken care of very well, and i've been here numerous times because it's a very enjoyable experience
Incredible food and variety
Service with no pretensions or attitude
But they can make you wait for an hour though
You have to be patient when going there
Even most who live in the neighborhood don't know this classic Italian place
The prix fixe 23
00 full dinner meal is the best thing going and you choose from an assortment of entrees, apps with dessert and coffee

The service and hospitality was excellent, the crowd was fun and energetic and the music was hot! Unlike other NYC hot spots, everyone left their egos at the door
This place was friendly and just filled with an awesome vibe
Highly recommend this place to everyone!!  P

Thanks Iman for taking care of us!
Thanks Le Souk!  I was looking for a venue to take my Mother for her last night in New York and discovered Le Souk
Since my mother is French, her standards are high; She knows good service and superb food but Le Souk met her standards!
The combination of atmospher, service and entertainment thrilled her!   The menu was exciting, matching the service!  Thanks!!!  This is a huge compliment,
Thank you Le Souk! I couldn't have chosen a better venue to have my graduation party; everyone from my collage friends to my parents had a fantastic time!
,
The food, ambiance and service equaled one another to be A++ !!!
This is the perfect venue, and, one of the few that truly know how to manage large groups
I just can't say enough about the fantastic vibe and wonderful melange of music, and a fun night had by all
Fair is fair, the place is so much fun, We had such a great time so did everyone else that we saw around us
I really don't see how not to have fun in le Souk unless you had a bad day ! Not a four star restaurant
but worth the trip
If you are easily amused and enjoy over-priced crappy cold food this place is for you
If you like to enjoy friends' company and terrific food in a pleasing environment, STAY AWAY! Went for a b-day party and everyone hated it
It was great seeing each other again but I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding this place like SARS
I won't write much more, I just suggest reading the other negative reviews on here and you'll get a fair idea of the place
I wish I had paid attention to them instead of ignoring them and hoping for the best
i rolled 20 deep here and dropped roughly a G but i have to say that it was worth every penny
there's a lot of culture here and a great time is waiting for those willing to really kick it--smoke a hookah, try a belly dance, keep the sangria coming
those of you who get on citysearch and bash restaurant after restaurant, those who are hestitant to give le souk due props probably need to pack better company
it's not the restaurant, it's an internal error, whether it be 1
) your friends are lame and uninteresting 2
) you don't have a thick enough roll to have fun 3
) you don't have any hot girls/guys in your posse, or a combination of all three
i have never given a restaurant a bad review because honestly i have fun every time i dine
the situation is what you make of it!
Friday night my friend and I came to Le Souk as we often do
the food was great and the belly dancer was gorgeous
at the end of the meal the hostess came to us and rudely ask us to leave the table, we were astonished by her attitude
we asked for the check and said that we never going to come to that restaurant again
the manager of the  restaurant over heard what we said and came to us
he politely asked about what happened, we told him about the hostess behaviour, the manager apologized for the her behavior and treated us to a drink at the bar
he also promised to make sure that it will never happen again
please Le Souk don't let unprofessional hostess to talk to costumers
luckily the manager tek care of that issue
the rest of the night was unbelievable
Thank you
This club is way overrated
In spite of being on the guest list the bouncers treated us like s***, and in fact even told us that reservations were for dinner and we had no business being there so late
And even among seedy lower east side locations, this takes the cake
Standing in the line one evening, we were witness to a homicide, and the cops came in twice in to Le Suk coz they were trying to throw out people who had been staying in for more than two hours
The only saving grace are the beautiful waitresses, but in the end it is just not worth it
I loved walking in Le Souk and seeing a smile on everyone's face
This place is so much fun, high energy, good food and reasonable prices
The female belly dancer on saturday night was pathetic; the male was better
food - portions were great for the price, but by the time the food got to the table, it was cold and above all not tasty at all
chicken was dry (but someone at the table liked the lamb)
The staff was too pre-occupied with smoking that hookah and watching the belly dancing than tending their tables
I know it's the East Village and they're more laid back , but c'mon now

Highly over-rated
i wish we had gone elsewhere
We were in New York 2 days and we came here both nights, its fantastic! So much fun and so lively
The dancers are great to watch, food is pretty good, not too bad priced, drinks are good too
I'd definitely recommend going here if you're going to NYC
We showed up w/ a party of 8
The restaurant had down a party of 6
Not sure who made the mixup, but the hostess fixed everything for us -no problem
you feel like you've stepped into a private room in a villa in Marrakesh on something
The decor and atmosphere is unbelievable
Perfect romantic spot (thankfully as the place was packed) and were seated immediately
our table wasn't the best but that's the only negative point i can make
the food was wonderful and completely affordable, the French-speaking waiting staff was very efficient and friendly, The manager popped his head in to ensure we enjoyed our meal
the wine we ordered was inexpensive but really good
Great time had by all in our party
Hearing about it everywhere, seeing it on TV several times with those all new dating shows in town
I said I have to give it a try, why not
The minute I walked in this hidden place on the ave b I felt so happy and I don't know why
This place has such a cool vibe that put a smile on my gloomy face
Good energy, fun place, nice ambiance and tasty food
no wonder it was so packed
Best evening I had in NYC
What a night considering the great meal, service, scene and party
Prices were comparable to other restaurants/clubs in the area
Too bad I have to go away but be back soon and I can hardly wait to return
My wife and I have visited Le Souk twice in the past cpl of month and made sure we had reservation both times
It is a very romantic place but not so much so that you can't also visit as a group (last time we brought everyone with us)
We all loved the food, the ambiance, the music and the belly dancers
We are planning to go back to le Souk for our anniversary party soon and will definitely make sure we will invite all of our friends again
The food here is not so good - our chicken was served cold and untasty
The atmosphere is great though, with belly dancers, hookas, and live music
My suggestion would be to just go for drinks- skip the food
if you want a lot and i sead a lot of fun go in the tent nice music best servise u just fell like home
the server is gona make you fell like a king the food is like you never imagine and the bellydansers uauu
recomendet for big partys
Bad music blaring, 20 min line for coatcheck, incompetent management, obnoxious doormen, $9 cocktails, overcrowded - just a few reasons why this place is horrendous
Definitley a bar that has a higher opinion of itself than it should
Le Souk is LE SUCK!!! They have the worst service imaginable! We reserved a table for 10 and the waiters made us wait 3 hours to be seated
The food was horrible
NEVER AGAIN!!! Overly priced and not worth it! For the money I spent, I should've gone to a nicer restaurant with better service
Stear Clear!!! (we had reservations and the bouncers outside made us wait 15 minutes outside in the cold
who needs the velvet rope treatment when you're having dinner
give me a break!!!)
I love this place - so much fun and a great atmosphere
The crowd is really good looking and friendly
would highly recommend

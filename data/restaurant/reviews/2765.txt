Only the spinach was good
needless to say, we didnt stay for dessert
The table next to us ordered lots of drinks (at $8-10 a drink) and they got served before us, even though we arrived and ordered a good 15 minutes before them
Also, the service sucked
There was a large party next to us, and they were really upset that the waiter forgot two orders, and they were left without food, while all their friends got their food
I will never go back to this nasty italian place, not when there is sotto voce closer to my house
My husband and I been going there on and off for over a year now
I think they're spending more money on redecorating rather than maintaing the quality of food
The food is NOT what it used to be
My linguine w/clams was just gross
Plus their head waiter is very pushy
especially with the wine
He sold the same wine to three tables last night
when Mangia first opened, my husband and I were in love with the place! We are regulars and dine in and order out very often
I am sad to say that their new manager is making it hard for us to visit our local favorite
The past 3 times we have gone, he is rude and curt and makes the whole experience frustrating
Our waiter is always WONDERFUL and friendly and the food is great and inexpensive
The manager however, insists on taking our order and speaks to you like he would rather you go away
He isn't friendly and has little knowledge about the food
When I ask him questions about new dishes, he mumbles something short and seems frustrated that I asked hm in the first place
What a shame! everything else is SO great!
We just received a pizza from delivery and i opened it and just said 'What?' There were sesame seeds on the outside (it's pizza dough not a hamburger bun), barely any sauce, VERY thin slices of mozzarella sparingly applied and topped with lots of herbs
What happened to the toppings? Where's the cheese? Where's the sauce? Where i come from, pizza is a meal, not a piece of bread with a teaspoon of sauce for the whole thing
I hope this is not a sign of what is available
If so, i want to go home!
We were lured in by Ruben, who then proceeded to take very good care of us
Drinks reasonable, food really plentiful and very good, and oh! that CHEESECAKE! Have been back several times, and it holds up
But don't tell anyone
It's our little secret! :)
You've gotta be kidding me!! The pizza isn't worth $3/slice
I've stopped going since they increased their prices
That's the problem with decent places getting written up
they start charging an arm a leg for a slice of pizza
I absolutely love this place
My boyfriend and I have added it to the top of our list of neighborhood resturant staples
The food is incredible, the prices are unbelievable, and without fail the staff always makes us feel as if we're dining at a pricey, special place
the fettucine alfredo is to die for, as is the fresh mozarella pizza
Finally, a new Park Slope resturant without a pretentious staff and overpriced menu! WELCOME MANGIA!!!  Hands down, best Italian in the neighborhood
Great informal dining room and friendly service
We tried the Margerita pizza which was very yummy
We also got a salad that was fresh and delicious
Great place to do take out from too
We will be back
Stumbled into this kitchen on a cold night and found it uncrowded and amazingly tasty
Pastas were perfectly cooked and seasoned, calamari fried to perfection and just enough cheese on cheesy things to still be called authentic Italian
Good wine list and beautiful and simple candlelit surroundings
We'll definitely go back
Best quick pizza in the Slope with really friendly workers
Beats out all the others
It's everything I look for in a pizza place
Great pizza, not pricey, very friendly, and fast
They also make killer eggplant
Best Baked Ziti in the area, great classic NY pizza
A neighborhood institution
Don't order from this place! It's a joke! I placed my order for a party of 20, 4 days in advance
The day of the party, I called to confirm and they basically lost the order and couldn't fill it
Completely unprofessional and ruined my party!!!!!
Crispy crusts, fresh flavors, nice and hot
Best pizza in the hood
Just try not to order at busy times, the quality goes down a little
Takeout only
Another branch of the La Bagel empire, this little store is a bit off the beaten track for many, but boasts the same great, cheap bagels and other breakfast treats
If you live near the route of the train formerly known as B, it's definitely worth checking out
The food was great, and Laura even waited on us and checked in periodically to make sure everything was ok
However there were points when we felt as though we were in someone else's living room
This will either turn you on or off
Rather chintzy decor reminiscent of my aunt's town house on Staten Island--the heavy velvet curtains and gilded frames
Only thing missing was a pic of the Pope kissing Joe Dimaggio
The scowls from other diners were lame: Windsor Terrace is a nightmare for people who aren't into tricking out their McClaren strollers or organizing sing a longs for their pugs
If you want a hug and a kiss on the cheek from a woman who doesn't know you, why not go to your Aunt's house in Elizabeth? It also appears as though they go through one delivery person per week
Maybe not a good sign?
Laura's is very approximate in matching the menu description to what they serve
A salad was listed as including smoked salmon, but arrived without it
When I asked the waitress, she told me they couldn't afford the salmon, and had changed the dish (though not on the menu)
Pizza margerita comes without the promised basil
There's an ad hoc quality: You won't get what you ordered, but it's okay
The service is really weird and hostile
One example: They literally took bread from my baby, after we ordered a brick oven pizza, not food (the waiter's words)
I asked if there was a minimum, which there wasn't; he'd give us the bread only if we'd paid for it -- this, after my baby had eaten of it
We're talking small piece of italian bread, nothing fancy
It was ridiculous
We didn't ask for a water refill, lest he charge us
The food is alright
They're often out of whatever you want
I once ordered 4 dishes and they were out of 3 of them
The pizza's pretty good
The decor is tacky, like your grandma decided to decorate the place in Victorian style at cut-rate prices
It's an okay neighborhood place, but don't bother traveling here from another neighborhood
Lets start out positively, the food at Laura's is very good
I don't claim to know enough about authentic Italian cuisine but the food is good, provided they have the menu item you order
The quirky staff is where Laura's fails to deliver
I've been there a dozen times and you never know how much the bill will be
Yes the menu shows prices but you still can never tell
I've had dinner and a couple of glasses of wine for $25 and I've had similar meals totaling in the $40's
The pizza is good, the burgers are tasty, the pasta is lackluster but decent
There's no reason to go out of your way for it, but there's no reason to avoid it if you're in the hood
ONE OF THE BEST PIZZA IN BROOKLYN , NEED AN AC FOR SUMMER
That's exactly what Rocky's is - it's on the nasty side of Kensington
The pizza is pretty typical $1
50/slice Brooklyn pizza - never too hot, never too good

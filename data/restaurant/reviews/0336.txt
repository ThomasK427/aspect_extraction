Many of the dishes turn on a few simple elements, like a salad of fennel, orange and black olives or a plate of chopped artichokes that churn through an alternately salty, lemony and crunchy cycle on the tongue
Dishes also include steamed branzino with vegetables, and a gutsy frutti di mare al Cartoccio--a bread-topped crock of clams, mussels, calamari and monkfish
I have been to sooo many restaurants in NYC
Out of all of them Palma is hands down the best
The dining experience is like no other
The restaurant has such an amazing Mediteranean aura to it that you completely forget that you are in NYC
I reccomend trying to sit outside in the garden surrounded by all the gorgeous flowers
The food is to die for
Do try the *** Zuppe di Pesce***, Lobster salad, and the Calamari (out of all my trips to Italy never had better!) The owner and her husband are wonderful people who seem to create a home-like feel to their guests
They have a carriage house in the back for private parties and you shouldn't be surprised if you see very well known faces coming out of there
I really can't reccomend a restaurant more then Palma
If you haven't been there yet then you are missing out
All my friends I have reccomended it to have echoed my response- that it's the best restaurant in nyc
Definitely a 10 +!!!
I enjoy great Restaurants! Palma is the BEST! I live uptown, when I want to have that special dining, I go downtown to Palma! The food and the service is fantastic!  I think the Restaurant is special for my dining needs, when i'm alone or with a friend, I enjoy sitting in the window fealing cozy in the corner, when my party is 4 or more the garden great! On a clear night looking up at the stars in the sky is beautiful
The Carrage House, I always take my partys there, it has a VIP fealing that says to my guest, You are all so special to me!  The best thing is fealing like I'm home
Hi Palma what's for Dinner!
Overall, Palma was a great dining experience
Went there this past weekend with a group of four at 8 with a reservation and had the chance to sit in the absolutely wonderful backyard dining patio
We shared the lobster salad, the caprese salad, the artichoke, and rice and cheese appetizers
The rice and cheese was a bit plain, but yummy and the caprese salad was standard
The lobster salad, while good, was small and the artichoke had been fried and tasted slightly like french fries
For entrees, we ordered the lamb chop (great, with potatoes and on a bed of greens sauteed in olive oil and garlic), the swordfish, and the gnocchi
It was apparent to all that our friend who had ordered the zuppa di pesce had certainly won the ordering contest! His entree was a dramatic huge puffy pastry surrounding a dish with scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels, and other seafood inside cooked in a savory red broth
Absolutely delicious! For any seafood lover, it's a must try! Wine was delicious and service (despite the other posts) at the table wasn't too bad
The only downfall of the whole night happened in the very beginning when we asked the bartender if we could put the drinks on our table's tab
He insisted, No, you must pay at the bar here
My friend and I went to split the $50 bill and he looked at both of us, said, UGHHH! and took our money
He was INCREDIBLY rude
Everything we ordered tasted great from the apps, drinks, meal and all
The artichoke was a great treat as were their magaritas!!! Too bad our tip couldn't reflect it, we didn't feel comfortable leaving our worthless waiter any regard
The garden is ideal for seating, but it's all good!
I finally went over to Palma last weekend
The front room was bustling with activity, and (as a New Yorker) I was not surprised that I'd have to wait for my table
I rather appreciated the host tell me honestly how long I could expect to be waiting, rather than having him hand me a lie and a smile (like some other places in this ever-changing city would have done)
So I settled in at the bar, and chatted with others there while we waited
Very communal, very fun, very New York
When I had my dinner, the appetizers were flawless (try the carciofi and the polpettini), the entree was succulent (and fun having the branzino fileted at the table), and the tiramisu
well, you'll have to try it yourself! All in all, a very positive experience that reminded me of why I've never left New York
The food here is good although my chicken had a little too much sauce on it, and reasonably priced compared to any Manhattan Restaurants
We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated inside right away, it would have been about a 20 minute wait for the outdoor garden
The server was friendly and apologized for not being more responsive to our table
The wine list is okay although some of the drinks offered are really more ports than glasses to be served during the meal, which the menu doesn't really distinguish
Other than that, not bad
We went to Palma last Friday night and had the most terrible service I've experienced in years
We arrived on time for our 8:30 pm reservation to be told of a slight wait by the maitre d'
This slight wait extended into a TWO HOUR WAIT during which the rude maitre d' told each of the members of our party a different story, seated people who arrived before us first, and was generally both cocky and unpleasant
When we finally walked away at 10:30 pm and complained about our experience, he did not even apologize
We went around the corner to a great little French bistro where the staff was both pleasant and likeable and the food great (Le Gigot)
This place is DEFINITELY not worth it
Life's too short
Great food, great ambience
Must make reservations though
Cool outdoor dining
Arriving at the restaurant 10 minutes late, my friends and I were informed that our reservation was already given away
We gladly offered to wait for the next available table
However, the Maitre'd obnixously informed us that no additional tables will be opening up for the evening
Since it was barely 10 o'clock on a saturday night and many patrons looked ready to leave, I was completely shocked that I had to ask again what he meant by we will not be seating any more people for the evening
I don't know if this was his pathetic tactic to make this tiny restaurant a bit more exclusive or that he was just on some sort of bizarre power trip
All in all, the food is not even good enough to justify for that type of rude attitude
I stopped by Palma last night and had drinks but no food so can't comment on that
Wine and coffee were both great
My friend and I stayed at the bar for almost 2 hrs and were not rushed but was serviced well
the ambience of this place is small and rustic but quaint
May come back here to try the food out!
Dinner for four at Palma
Promptly seated and provided drinks in a hurry
For apps - calamari and shrimp
Very fresh and flavorful
Arugla salad with fennel, oranges and olives was nice, but nothing special
Entrees were out of site
Perfectly cooked lamb, well accompanied by rabe and potatoes
Swordfish and spinach ravioli were spot on
The star of the show was the fish stew
A thin, crusty dome of bread covered a large bowl of seafood, fresh herbs and an exquisite broth
When the server cuts the dome and folds it back, the scent that escapes burns itself into your memory
The taste makes you reconsider dinner plans forever
With the back gardens casual atmosphere and the attentive wait staff, and you have a go-to restaurant
Only negative was the wait for the food perhaps the smallish kitchen? but it didnt sour the overall excellent experience
My husband and I happened to stumble upon it as we were strolling through the village and ended up having a really fantastic time dining in the garden out back
It was very romantic and the food was excellent
My husband had the lamb which was very tasty and I had the zuppa di pesce which has gained the reputation of being their signature dish
It was just fantastic and a deal for $23 given the abundance of seafood in the dish
Our waitstaff was very friendly and quite attentive
The food took awhile, but the ambiance was so lovely that we didn't care
I'm definitely going back for the zuppa
I have had very few better Italian dining experiences in NY
Palma has great food and an excellent wine selection
My girlfriend said she's never had better fettecini, even in Italy!
My wife threw me a surprise birthday party at Palma last night and it was one of the best times I've ever had at a restaurant
The food was incredible, the space was beautiful andthe service was exceptional
The party was held in the back farmhouse which really looked like you were in someones country kitchen
We had our own personal server who attended to us all night and was a pleasure to have around
There was never an empty glass on our table which is saying something since our group likes to have a drink or two
I don't even know what to say about the food
from start to finish everything was simply amazing
45 standing staff not frindley vat all 65 min to get food food cold
I have eaten at Palma a few times but this last time was amazing
I don't usually dine out on Sundays but I am glad that we did this time
The food was amazing though there weren't any specials

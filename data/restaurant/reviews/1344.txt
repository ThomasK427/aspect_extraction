And then to add insult to injury, the bill was $26 for what was by leaps and bounds the worst breakfast I've ever had
If you're serving garbage, charge $5
00 for it
Gravy is great as a local staple that you can go to without thinking much about if you're dressed appropriately or if your budget can handle an impromptu splurge
I love the red flannel corned beef hash and the pancakes with mixed berries
The portions are respectable and the atmosphere is always warm and comfortable
This place is not for you if you're looking for a trendy or fancy dining experience
It's great for just a relaxing and hearty greasy spoon meal
Good feelings ended as soon as we walked in
Our waiter was less then welcoming when taking our drink orders (apparently he doesn't like beer or milkshakes)
After disappearing for about 15 minutes he came back for our food order (if you're going to play the TGI Friday's game and not write down the orders at least hire people with some short term memory
)
10 minutes later we received one soda and one beer but two milkshakes were missing
When they finally arrived they were wrong which the waiter acknowledged with a shrug and walked away
When we received our food it was getting cold and pretty much tossed at us
Not to mention through all of this we froze as there didn't seem to be a drop of heat in the place
We paid the check with a minimal tip and hightailed it out of there
never to return
I really wated a bite to eat late one night so I went to Gravy
It was so horrible
The food was cold and did not match the description on the menu, the waiter could not be bothered with me (and I am nice to deal with since I work in the industry), and it was way over priced
DO NOT EAT HERE
It is just another trendy bad place
call us suckers, but we keep trying this place and the minute we sit down think that it can't possibly be as bad as our past with them
It always is
EVERY time (4x now and nevermore- over the past 4 months so not only when it first opened) the servers forget our toast, water our OJ down, NEVER check to see how we are doing, often just cannot be found
I was a server for a long time and I have the tendency to be too easy and overtip- this place has twice made me not only not want to leave anything, but leave a note (neither of which i did- i always soften up)  the bean pattie is good
that's it
When a restaurant first opens, it's going to have problems
Gravy has many regulars; people who come that morning for 'inedible breakfast,' then come back for dinner
I am one of those regulars
I am greeted with a delightful staff
I've also had my waitress reply when we said we're ready to order say, I didn't ask for your order, I asked for your drink
Of course, this was said in good humour and made the entire table laugh
She then took our food order which came out promptly
Give it another try
I did and I'm still going back for seconds!
Alright, I live down the street from Gravy, and I must say that I really enjoy both the ambiance and the food
Maybe it's because I'm originally from the South, but to me nothing beats their chicken fried steak, or the fried chicken
And in case you're not in the mood for anything with the word fried in the title, the veg
chili is also great
Wasn't too happy with the bbq ribs though
The only downfall of this place is that they don't have authentic sweet tea
You can't have a restaurant with a Southern flair without it
Take note from the Soul Spot just around the corner
that is REAL sweet tea
Food is absolutely terrible, very disappointed
They charged me $4
00 for 4 extra pieces of broccoli and $4
00 for soggy fries
You can get way better fries at Wendy's
I spoke to the manager and was told he couldn't do anything about it
So basically I paid $1
00 per broccoli
The red velvet cake was stale! Save yourself the trouble and go to a better place that doesn't rip people off

Had dinner at Gravy recently and was not impressed
The room is a silly (good thing) recreation of a 50's rec room, but both food and service were lousy
Tomatoes in salad were rock hard, fried fish was dry and greasy (no easy task), and our waiter was spacy and hard to track down
Dessert was bad, too
The OJ tasted watered down
My friends coffee was served in a cracked mug that was actually leaking
We asked for a new mug and some milk or cream and it took at least 25 minutes, asking 2 different waitresses, and being told twice it was coming right up
When our food did arrive they forgot every ones toast and not only was our food cold but both my sausages was still frozen in the middle
I never send back food too but did this time and received the same 2 cut in half sausage pucks on a micro waved plate
I can understand if the place was slammed but it was only half full and it's not a big place to begin with
I will be back to Brooklyn but will never return to Gravy!
Ouch! these guys are having a tough time according to these reviews! i just wanted to say they make great bloody marys, which are great to drink while sitting on the back patio on a nice sunday
my friends and i go there after late saturdays and chill outside and drink
i think the $5 dollar breakfast is great hangover food, but then again, it's hard to mess up eggs, right? ive never had anything else on the menu, though
good luck guys!! constructive critiscism is a good thing, right?
Having been a waiter I realize how tough it is to start a new restaurant
However this Gravy takes the biscuit for being quite simply BAD! The waiter spilled coffe on my table, offered no apology, forgot half my order , and never once checked in on me or asked how things were
I guess he was sick of getting answers from customers who would obviously say YUK! When the half of my order arrived, it looked like it was swimming in fat and the sausage could have been used to throw at a wild dog and do him an injury
Gravy can be full of fat and bad for you, and this restaurant lives up to his name
If you like to complain
check it out as you won't be dissappointed!
southern food by people who've never been to the south
great items on the menu lured us in- southern fried chicken, blackened catfish, bbq ribs, hushpuppies
i had the burger, my wife had the catfish with hushpuppies
both disappointments
catfish was undercooked, and not very good even after we sent it back
burger sounded interesting -two pattie with cheese in the middle- but the english muffin was cold untoasted
hushpuppies, one of my favorites( and something you can never find in ny) were totally bland
i feel bad, hope they get it together
i love southern food, would have been a great addition to the neighborhood
but maybe they'll do fine without us
This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had
After we sat there for 20 minutes the waitress finally came over and asked what we wanted to drink, I said Actually, I think we're ready to order and she replied I didn't ask you what you wanted to order, I asked you what you wanted to drink It only got worse from that point
We sat there for an hour before finding out our order had never never been placed and then left with only having a glass of oj
We dine out a lot and tip very well, we understand it's hard work but this was insane
We gave it another try and again, horrible

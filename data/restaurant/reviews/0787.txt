Although the food was good, the service was extremely poor
My guest and I were disappointed by the rudeness and unprofessionalism of the staff
Asking questions to the staff about the contents on the menu could be a lethal experience
The staff was impersonal, unempathetic, and unknowledgeable about the cuisine
My strawberry daiquiri was served in a water glass rather than the appropriate cocktail glass
The sweet potato pecan pie was extremely small and tasteless
I love this place
It's small, and during peak hours can be crowded, but the atmosphere is funky and laid-back and the food uniformly good
The sangria is great (and a bargain), as are some of the cheap starter dishes that you can actually make a meal out of--the mac cheese and the red beans rice, in particular, are amazing
The major con is that the service is always slow, even when the dining room is nearly empty; I understand that the restaurant still isn't turning a profit, so maybe that explains why they seem to be understaffed
But it's such a fun, friendly place that this has never bothered me too much
recently met a friend for dinner, while it's on the small side, we loved the decor/ambiance of the place
I had the seafood casserole and she had the steak frites
I highly recommend either of the steak dishes
as for the seafood casserole, only order it if you are in the mood for something that's more Thai like
while it wasn't bad, I was slightly disappointed b/c I was expecting something a little different in taste and creamier as opposed to soupy
all in all I'd definitey go again
Every time we go to Native we have the best time! The food is delicious, simple and inexpensive- cocktail and wine list great for the restaurant size (about 20 tables)- and the music is always great
What really make sthe place tho' is the ambience and that you always meet the most interesting people there
It's been a long time since I've been in a restaurant that felt like home and Native does that! Consistently a pleasure with no pretense
The food at Native was really good!!!!! I have been there several times and every experience has been a positive one
I strongly recommend the catfish grits
Also, the salmon jasmine rice is superb!!!! The service was really good as well
So on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being the lowest score 1 would rate Native a 10
It definitely is a new hot spot in Harlem
Tiffany Harris Yonkers, New York
First dining experience was superb
Great food, good service and high hopes for a neighborhood spot to call my own! Catfish sandwich was excellent
I tasted my friend's grits delicious! The next times haven't been as nice
The Moroccan chicken was tough and terrible
Another dish was cold
Saturday 11/1, I special ordered an omelet
What I got was not what I ordered - okay though
I mentioned to the server that the order was wrong
He barely grunted
So, I just ate it
The service has been poor some other times too
As small as the place is, one would think you could easily make eye contact with servers
Think again
No one is checking on you
You have to beg them to come to the table
They seem aloof
Oh yeah, they run out of items on the menu frequently
It has potential
I'm wishing for the best
Okay, it is October 10, 2003 at 9pm
This restaurant was going good, until it was time to go
I don't think I will be going here again, and that's a shame, because I was feeling this Harlem spot
The atmosphere was a+, until a friend and I were rudely interrrupted and rushed out by the attendant at the door when the check was only returned to us just 5 mins
before
The woman was like, Um, excuse me I don't mean to be rude, but there are a few people here with reservations, if you could possible get ready to go
Maybe you could continue your conversation at the bar
We literally just left the tip in the booklet, NO bathroom wait! nada! We were leaving in minutes
Bad taste in your mouth! Don't expect to spend a lot of time
2 other tables available for parties of two!!
Fanatastic food and good value
Try the brown chicken stew
I went to Yvonne's to get some soulfood but instead all I got was terrible customer service
I ordered cabbage, candied yams and macaronni and cheese
The person behind the counter wanted to put my food in a plastic container no bigger than my hand
I asked him if he could give me a bigger container (otherwise he would have had to literqally pile my food on top of one another)
He said NO I had to pay more for him to put my food in a larger container
I was so disgusted that he wanted me to pay more money in order to have a larger container
While I was trying to get a container I had an opportunity to look at the food and it looked as if it was sitting out all day
I left the restaurant and went down the block to a Spanish restaurant
Xicala was nice and cute, with a great wine list
It wasnt very crowded which was refreshing
However the service was up and down
Server's were extremely nice, yet were socializing too much with friends that were having drinks at the bar and it was difficult to get their attention
The food was decent, they have a great cheese plate, but I wish our server knew the cheeses, and had simply asked the kitchen what they were when I inquired
It was a good experience, but I prefer N
I love the ambience at Xicala - especially when they have live music Wednesday nights
My routine never changes - pitcher of Strawberry Sangria with a couple of close friends, a platter or two of cheese and fruit and an order of olives
Can't go wrong
If anything it makes an otherwise horrible day right
definitely a nice place to chill
don't be in a rush if you want to try this place! reasonable prices
GREAT atmosphere
nice out of the way little spot
Perfect for a date of any type! The place is tiny but extremely warm and friendly
The bartender was accomodating and helpful
We ordered the tasting tray and everything we tasted was absolutely delicious
The wine choices are fabulous and the sangria is incredibly tasty!
This may be the smallest restruant I have ever been in but they make up for it with great tapa's and wines
You can't fit 20 people in here so it is deffinately cozy
The staff are friendly and the service is good
This place is worth visiting
Xicala is a great little romantic Spanish hideaway thats surrounded by a young hip neighborhood
The music is romantic as is the atmosphere
I loved the array of wine and was very pleased with the service
Try the chorizo con papas!
This is a great little wine bar
It has good music, nice tapas, an interesting selection of wines (primarily Spanish) and a lowkey hip neighborhood clientele
Most importantly, it is reasonably priced
This is definitely a hidden gem, which will not stay undiscovered for long
i had a great time
and the bands were great
Great food, interesting decor
So there are good points, but it was completely ruined by bad service
I had eaten there 3 times in 2 years as it was close to a hotel I often stay at, but on the last time I almost blew my top

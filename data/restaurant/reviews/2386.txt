Though we were seated, the whole atmosphere was rather in the style of a big rush (eat fast, spend a lot of money, and get out)! Wait staff was uncompetent (or unwilling) and could not tell us much about the 'cheaper' Chianti - 'cheaper' meaning '60$'
You don't expect this in restaurant where you spend 230$ for the basics of an Italian dinner (we only had entree, wine, and dessert) This experience will remain in my memory - unfortunately as one of the most unpleasant restaurant experiences in NY
I just had dinner here tonight, I'm not sure what so great about this place
The food was bland, there's no distinguished taste to the fish nor the pasta that I had
The service wasn't all that great, I had some snotty Italian waiter who thinks he's the wine expert and recommended us a few top line wine
It's a waste of money, I think I can have a better meal at a no name mom pop restaurant and pay a fraction of the bill
Monstrously over priced and with attituded to boot
We went with a big party of 9 and tried numerous dishes--all basic, bland and way too expensive
The ceaser salad we ordered was old, limp and yellowed
Waiters are snooty and snubb you over and over
We couldn't wait to get out of there
For an Italian NY experience there are so many great places with better atmosphere, MUCH better food, for half the price and twice the experience
The only thing we were able to digest was the wine
Food so unedible we HAD to ask to take it back
They returned in a minute
as though they had zapped it in the microwave for a minute! We asked them just to take they plates away we couldn't eat them
Starving still, we asked for the desert menu
I ordered icecream
Apparrently they make the waffle part which they serve the icecream on in a pan in the kitchen
My waffle tasted like ONION! The pan had not been properly cleaned and the smell and taste transfered to the waffle cone
The icecream melted on the cone and tasted like onion also
Vanilla Onion flavor! We were starving afterwards and spent like $114 dollars each on food that was not edible!
While I am more than willing to pay a little more for a phenomenal experience, I found Il Nido to be not worth the cost
The wine list is extensive, and expensive
The servers try to upsell everything, pointing out their favorites as the most expensive dishes and bottles of wine available
The pasta is very good, though nothing extraordinary
The meat and chicken entrees left much to be desired
All told, I am not likely to return
There are plenty of better Italian restaurants in Manhattan
We split the Eggplant Parmigiana for our appetizer and the Three Pasta Special as a first course
We had a veal dish and the red snapper for our entrees, Italian Cheesecake and Pistachio Gelati for dessert
Everything was absolutely delicious
The service was great
The past two times I have been to the restaurant it has been utter dissappointment
The waiters are beyond unfriendly and the food is way average
Better off at Nino's down the street
If you're looking for bang for your buck, don't expect to be blown away by the $24 spaghetti with tomato sauce (no meat)
We had to ask for water three times and then I was told I had insulted the kitchen when I asked for parmesan on my pasta
Even if you can tolerate snooty service, there are plenty of better-priced places with comparable Italian food in the neighborhood
Ambience is nice and they do the prepare-food-at-your-table gimmick
I arrived at San Pietro hearing great things and rave reviews
The atmosphere was nice and the servers were friendly
Our biggest mistake was to stray from the print menu and take suggestions from the waiter for appetizers and entrees
They will charge you whatever they want for their own creations, tagging on a huge bill for small portions of cheese and vegetables
After having the waiter bring us 4 of the suggested appetizers and enjoying 4 simple (and average at best) pasta entrees, the bill was well above expensive, it was almost a joke
When reviewing our bill at the end, we noticed that there was a couple of additional bottled waters tagged on and we still can't understand the outrageous cost that blindsided us
proceed with caution!
I am a business traveler who had heard of this restaurant and was very disappointed with the ambiance provided - the servers were professional but were constantly being yelled at by the manager in front of customers
The manager I found out later was the owner
He was so rude to his staff that we were making fun of the manager after a while
The food was average and the service was good but ambience was totally embarrassing for my server who kept apologizing for the owner's loud outbursts to the staff
Spoiled the whole evening - it even appeared that the hostess on duty quit on the spot after asking the owner to tone down his outbursts because customers were getting uncomfortable
San Pietro Restaurant is the only NYC restaurant that I would not recommend
It could have been a very pleasant dining experience
Truly an amazing dinner/experience; the 4 hours went by like minutes
Service started a little slow, but the server and food made up for the wait
Very attentive and amusing staff, wonderful food, excellent pace of food service
I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal for a decent price in the heart of the city
Great wine, though it is a bit $$ The cheapest bottle was $60, if I remember correctly
Never have I been to a place where I was shuffled in and where the waiters pushed food on me instead of asking me what I wanted
The wine selection was sup-par regardless of all the accolades they received
If you go here you will be disappointed by the host, the food and the extremely tight tables
Top-tier food, top-tier service
Who can resist the lure of Venetian inspired murals, the small trattoria-esque atmosphere, the ever present truffles in the menu items
One of the best around
I thought the food was decent but certainly not worth the prices
Be careful letting the waiter suggest anything for you - they will almost certainly find some way to overcharge
The atmosphere is a combination of old school and the cheesyness of restaurant row
Some positives: pasta was fresh and definitely above average (although don't expect the best you've ever had) and the waiters are extremely knowledgeable
This is a good place to stop by for Italian lunch for those businessmen working by Lex
to 2nd Avenue and Midtown
The service is great where their soft Italian bread is served right away after being seated
The fettuccini alfred with bacon crisp is highly recommended as well as their Penne with vodka sauce
It is their affordable price for a pasta dish and tasty food makes me go back their every 2 weeks
Had Sunday brunch here
It was nice to have a mimosa, but the eggs and pancakes aren't worth the $12
Service was extremely slow
stepped in with a friend for what looked like a decent and affordable ($18) prix fixe
was disappointed with the service, appetizer and the entree - skipped out before they could tell us what dessert was
perhaps a la carte is a better option here
The Scene This tiny boutique restaurant, one of the most expensive in New York, is an ideal venue for a marriage proposal
The eatery features a variety of small, simply appointed dining spaces, including a small patio in back
Service is excellent--maitre d' Joseph Scalice is among the best frontmen in the city, and on birthdays and other special occasions, he's likely to appear tableside, a bouquet of roses at the ready
The Food Expect explosively flavored haute cuisine, crafted into sexy looking, tasting-sized portions
Wayne Nish is the gustatory visionary at March--his hallmarks are sweeping flavor contrasts and a flair with Asian ingredients
Highlights include the free-range Quebecois veal (with shimeji mushrooms, tomato, asparagus, pine nuts and tarragon) and the sauteed striped bass, which features a shredded-phyllo crust, fregola, stewed garlic and escarole
it's been a while, but in coming across this list i couldn't help but add my two cents on my romantic dinner there-- Rule #1-- If you are a server, thou shalt not hit on your female patron while her boyfriend is in the men's room
The service was spotty to begin with, and it's not the first time I'd been treated as if I were invisible at a table (hint- dumb move when the guy's paying), but if I'd known some of the weak come on's lobbed in before I'd left the place, I would have stiffed him at a minimum
A letter regarding the experience to the owner went unanswered
So yeah, you might say it's not on my recommended list
An overrated, over priced disappointment
The food was bland at best, never quite the right temperature for the dish, and the portions, even for a tasting menu, miniscule
Where were those vaunted explosively flavored superb creations? We arrived hungry and quite excited over the prospect of a romantic dining experience, and left hungry and totally disappointed
We had the 6 course tasting menu with paired wines
The wine selections were as unimpressive as the overrated food
The waiter was haughty and indifferent
Skip this place
NYC has far better places to dine for this kind of money
My husband and I wanted to have a nice romantic dinner before our show
A friend recommended March

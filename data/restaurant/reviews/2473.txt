It's like they had to cover up the lack of flavor
Also, the seafood was frozen, along with the peas
Chorizo was a poor quality
Overall it was gross
Stick to the cuban sandwiches if you want something edible
Once entering the cottage, one cannot ignore the friendly atmosphere and service; tables with happy faces engaging in delicious food and sociable conversation
The food is fresh and full of flavor not to mention the never-ending free wine served in large glass jugs
The best part is the bill, a dinner for two with 2 bottles of wine and extra sauce, sometimes a doggy bag is needed to finish the meal at home, placed nicely in the $20 reach
I had planned to take my boyfriend out for his birthday dinner to Silk Rose Restaurant which is acclaimed for its free wine and cheap Chinese food
Since the restaurant does not take reservations, we showed up to an hour wait
As we were hungry we wandered around and found the Cottage
It is just as good food as Silk Rose and free wine as well
The service is great!
The Scene If you're thinking about strolling into the Popover Cafe on a weekend morning, expect the place to be packed with Upper West Siders brunching on fluffy pancakes, omelets, and the ubiquitous popovers
For easier access, try lunch or dinner, when you're more likely to find a seat among the restaurant's numerous teddy bears and scattered pillows
The Food The vegetarian-friendly menu features everything from hearty soups and gooey sandwiches to fresh salads and homemade lemonade
Try Tara's Tarantella--a filling sandwich with smoked chicken, melted mozzarella, tomato, watercress, red onion, and a mustard vinaigrette--or the Horse of a Different Color (but only if you love horseradish)
What you really must have, however, are the popovers, steaming hot and smeared with a thick layer of the restaurant's delicious strawberry butter
I took my 11 year old daughter for a pre-Nutcracker dinner
The ambience was warm and cozy
My daughter loved the teddy bears lining the window sills
We don't eat meat outside the house and the vegetarian options were numerous- always a plus
My daughter's hot chocolate was very satisfying, as was our chocolate fondue for dessert
The only negative was the service, which was somewhat slow- not horribly slow, but slow enough to be a little irritating
I do, however, want to bring my husband and other kids here
I think they'd enjoy it!
This cramped, bland restuarant's idea of decor is painting the walls yellow and throwing up an occasional picture
We ordered from the brunch menu - he ordered the creole eggs and I ordered Mel's french toast
The waitress then gave us a complimentery hollow popover that was slightly burned and tasted of raw eggs but we ate it anyway
His dish was so small it looked like a side dish- about 2 (he thinks 3) eggs with some sausage chopped up and thrown in
Good flavor but no potatoes or toast anywhere
My french toast was two slices of bread cut in half- the perfect breakfast for a 4 year old
It was ok, but not great
After we were done and our lofty check arrived he vaguely mentioned getting a hot dog cause we were both still kind of hungry
This is the ideal place for a relatively quiet and quick bite to eat
Most people will be pleased to read that their menu is much more interesting than your average cafe or coffee shoppe fare
Definately try one of their trademark popover sandwiches
I highly recommend The Granny, which is turkey, thinnly sliced granny apple, turkey bacon, cheese, and onion
BTW, the service there is ALWAYS friendly and accomodating
I brought out of town guests here hearing how wonderful it was
It was terrible
The waitress forgot our coffee, took forever to take our order, never checked in with us after the food came and when we were done, didn't bring us the check for the longest time
As for the food, the person who ordered an omelette was satisfied but those that ordered pancakes or french toast received cold dishes
YUCK
The popovers were tasteless and the strawberry butter was miniscule
The person who ordered the omelette had eaten a popover before the food was brought out and the omelette comes with a popover
Nothing indicated that and the waitress couldn't be bothered to say
Total DISAPPOINTMENT
This restaurant charmed the socks off of me by using an at home feel
Their service was wonderful and prompt, with servers around whenever you needed them
I went for breakfast for a family gathering and the food was wonderful
Their food is superb!
we took a 10
00 cab ride to go there for breakfast
what a MISTAKE! the host was so rude i complained to the manager
she wasn't any better
i got mad and left
at 51 years of age, this was a first! we went down the street to good enough to eat where there was a line
we waited and we were glad! good food, great service and nice people
popovers success evidently has lead to arrogance which in time will give way to failure, unless they decide to change
I had brunch here this afternoon and thought everything went WAY DOWNILL! The food was not nearly as interesting as I remembered it being two years ago and the popovers were too large and overdone, not light and fluffy
We ordered the salads, which were terrible
The spinach salad came with 5 large slabs of bacon across the top and the vegetables were boring and tasteless
There are much better places for brunch, with far better tasting salads than here
And, I wish they could get at least the popovers right!
The food was enjoyable (brunch) but the overall attitude of the staff was deplorable
The manager acted as if he was doing us a favor by 'allowing' us to eat there
Absurd behavior by someone in 'the service industry
' Do yourself a favor and have brunch somewhere else
Although I was annoyed by the fact that I had to wait for 30 minutes to be seated, I was also excited bec a long wait usually means great quality
However, when I tried Cathleen's sandwich with avocado, mushroom and gruyere on their showcase Popover, I was very disappointed
Yes, the ingredients were fresh but the combination lacked imagination and synergy, and therefore unremarkable as if one had thrown together a gourmet salad on a croissant
Popover was interesting (it's basically an inflated crossant with the inner lining of a crepe) but it gets cold too quickly and the novelty of eating it wears off quickly
It should be considered an accessory to a meal rather than the meal in itself
In fact, the only thing I liked from my brunch was the strawberry butter which came with Popover
Its not a bad place but its reputation is definitely overrated
More than the best upper-west side brunch! The chicken POP pie has vegetables so nicely prepared it is like eating a vegetable garden
Most dishes have some novel ingredient that after you try it, makes you wonder why it wasn't always in there
The TAB (like a turkey club but with turkey, APPLE and bacon) is sublime
Oh, and the popovers with strawberry butter AND preserves will wow any out of town guests
Like the other reviews say, definitely avoid weekends which are packed
However, weekday afternoons are a good bet, after say taking someone over to the Museum of Natural History
The favs are of course the Popovers themselves with strawberry butter which melts right into the bread
The Popovers Benedict are delicious with the lemon Hollandaise sauce
The service is expedient
The decor at times has cutesy teddy bears lining the windows
At best it's a good brunch spot if you can land a seat, at worst it's overpriced diner food
If you can, this place is great for weekday lunches, not very crowded
The popover sandwiches are so great
I try to come here whenever I get in to the city
Keep your eyes open for the cute teddybear head near the ceiling on the yellow brick wall in the room with the espresso bar
It had me giggling for ages
I live right up the street and everytime I go to give this place I regret it
The management is terrible
The decor is worn as is in wornout and they need to remodel and update the layout
Service is just bad
The food is good
I have no complaints
PS I think the owner must rate himself
no one would give this place a 10!

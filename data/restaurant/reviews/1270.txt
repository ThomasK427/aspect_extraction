Dining out with kids is often a struggle but everyone is always happy here
I live a couple of blocks away and it's nice to see the neighborhood improving, thanks to neat little spots like this
A wee bit more pricey for the hood, but the delicious food is well worth it
You must try the crabcakes!!!! The pulled pork was a good buy with the mash potatoes
The mac n cheese was so thick and rich, my friend declared it absolutely decadent! Good times all around for this Cortelyou Road keeper
The neighborhood finally has a great local restaurant
Great food at reasonable prices and a kids menu
And when the backyard is open in the summer, it's a great spot to relax with a burger and brew!
The Scene White-washed walls with glowing pale rose lights provide a serene and peaceful setting
And the narrow, single-room dining room with tables lining each wall creates close, yet comfortable quarters where diners can anxiously await the dishes being served to neighbors
Service is warm and engaging
The Food The simple setting leaves all the focus on the food, which centers around the regional dishes of the southern Italian region of Puglia
Charcoal-grilled octopus tangled with slivers of onion, and red and yellow beets dotted with goat cheese and tossed with tangy vinaigrette are excellent starters
Understated pastas continue to impress, particularly the eggless fettucini with scallops, and a classic baked rice dish in tomato sauce
Pan-seared sea bass melts in the mouth, and the spicy fish stew satisfies a shellfish craving
For something sweet to finish, the cream-filled fritters with chocolate fondue are divine
Went to Ama for dinner last night w/ friends and it was incredible
The appetizers are suburb- try the zucchini flowers
For the main course, the homemade pasta with sunday ragu was perfect- surprisingly light and flavorful! Friends had seafood and fish dishes they loved
Great wine list, great place for either a date or to catch up with friends
Highly recommend it and can't wait to go back!
The food is fresh and incredible
Best hummus spread I have ever had, which they serve with their bread basket
Great wine list, great service and a really warm atmosphere
I would go back and although it is a little cramped, I think it is a great place to gather friends
Food was amazing - amiance great - service was subpar
they need to work on it being more consistent
Found the staff attentive, the food excellent, and the atmosphere very pleasant
Clean environment, modern with a touch of retro; both spacious and clean
Quiet, a great environment for conversation
From beginning to end, excellent, beginning with wine, through appetizer, entrees - I had lamb sweetbreads and my partner had a chicken dish - and our desert was a chocolate ice cream with warm chocolate cake, absolutely wonderful
Overall, very appealing menu, as well as enjoyable space and staff
I had dinner a couple of time to Ama
I found the food excellent, the octopus salad is to die for as well as the Zucchini Blossoms ( is a special )
As for main course the pastas are very good but what i really like is the zuppa id pesce
The service was very friendly and welcoming
Let the waiters recommended you dishes , they really know what they are selling
I will definitely come back
the pasta here is tasty and the calzone appetizer is amazing! this is great gourmet italian
my neighbor's whole baked fish looked great as well
the wait staff was also nice, contrary to a previous review
the restaurant seemed out of place, however
too shishi, pretentious for the neighborhood
i was so glad to find regional food that wasnt too modified to taste the locals
i went there about a month ago for my first date and honestly i thought it was very cute and romantic, the service was average, u might feel bit cramped, but the food made up for it
i wouldnt go here if ur looking for huge portions but this place is awsome for the good things come in small packege belivers
this place got on my good side and im def going back
What a disappointment! My sister and I couldn't wait to visit here; and when we finally did, boy were we annoyed
THE SERVICE HERE - WHAT SERVICE? We were first greeted with looks! Then our server never ever returned to ask how our appetizers, or entree or even dessert were (I know we had 3 courses - we're gluttons for punishment)
Oh yea, we found out they had specials that night b/c our neighbors asked about their prices
It seems that Mom (or Pop) stuck their cute daughters in the front, without first saying to them those people-they're what we call customers-be nice to them-they are actually paying us
Needless to say, I WILL NOT RETURN
The place is nice, the service is not bad but the food is average
In Short Chocolate treats sit in display counters at the front of this demure cafe, but the real action happens at the prep area behind the bar, where a house favorite, the three-layer chocolate cake, shares space with molten chocolate
In between, friends and lovers dig into fondue for two and the classic brownie sundae
Wines are helpfully paired with each dessert on the menu, and coffee, tea and soda is also available
Their famous chocolate cake is quite close to absolute perfection
The texture is phenomenally smooth and the cake is so moist and honestly, everything a chocolate cake was meant to be
The frosting melts in to the cake in between the layers, and oh man, it is just divine
Absolutely worth trying, especially if you're in the area
Possibly the best chocolate cake ever and service that goes above and beyond
They took the time to help my wife with a recipe and even sold her some of the baking chocolate they use at a cost
makes you want to come back again and again
Or I wouldn't fit into any of my clothes
They have a special tart that changes regularly and I keep going back to try the latest
I love their cake, which they now do as cup cakes
Honestly i can't think of anything that isn't wonderful
The food, the feel, the people! I'd move in if they'd let me
My experiences at the Chocolate Room have been out of this world and I highly recommend the homemade bittersweet hot chocolate with the spice
The first time we went there had been a party of 10 that was just seated and the rest of the tables were all full, so we decided to take the drinks to go
Although we had to wait a long while and the hostess was very busy behind the bar, she was very apologetic and sincere which made it feel ok to have to wait
She took what could have been a very aggrivating 1st impression and made us feel very comfortable
We actually came back the next day and had an equally wonderful experience and this time also had the homemade marshmellow in the hot chocolate
I didn't think it could get better, but it ABSOLUTELY did
Fabulous truffles- I love that they are named after women
I love the patricia - the dark chocolate cone with the spicy chili aftertaste! My favorite night out consists of 3 stops on the coolest block along 5th avenue: dinner at Peperoncino, dessert at the Chocolate Room, and a night cap at Total Wine Bar
Try it !
Like another poster, I really have to fight my urge to not go to The Chocolate Room each day it is open, because I adore their brownies (a great combination of a light texture with a deep and rich chocolate flavor), their cupcakes, and their milkshakes
The service is always nice (although I've always taken things to go), and it's pretty low-key despite being an obvious hit
If you're a chocoholic, I really think you won't be disappointed
This place is unbelievable! I bring every out of town guest here
it's that good
I have had the dark chocolate cupcake, chocolate milkshake and more
Everything is delicious
I can't stop thinking about this place and trying to come up with an excuse to go again
The reviews here speak for themselves
(except the one that likes Hershey's-are they kidding???) The husband/wife tema that run the place are two of the nicest people you will encounter and they seem to have found help that is almost as nice as themselves
As for the chocolates; they are wonderful
Their Chocolatier - Fritz Knipschildt - makes the most delicious and original treats around, they are as beautiful as they are delicious
The deserts made on premesis by Naomi are equally wonderful
We love to sit at the bar in back and watch as she prepares them
She is always happy to tell you all about everything
We love them so much, I've ordered my Birthday cake from them!
go for the truffles
they're the 1st thing you see in the case as you enter, cleverly all named after women
they are divine
there's one in particular, tangerine inside and chili glitter on the outside
i can't begin to describe the sweet mixed with heat
and there's a wonderful wine - a lightly carbonated white that i can't remember the name of that was amazing as well
This place simply has some of the best desserts in town

Still the greatest
The Newman is as good as it gets
Told Angela Cini about this pizza, and she cannot wait to get to NTC to try one
Just describing this pizza gets peoples mouths watering
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK Ron Fernandez
For a sclice of pizza, this place is great, especially late night
I used to live right by this place and go there for a slice after school
I now live in NJ and when i went back to see my friends i had a slice and rememberd why i missed the city so much
our pizza her in Jersey sucks compared to Pete's!!!!!!!!!
for some reason it's just not as good as it used to be
This place has amazing food and a wonderful prix fixe menu for early diners
Be warned, there are a lot of children in the restaurant (not exactly the place for a romantic dinner)
Great pizza, nice waiting staff, good beer - kids have crayons and games to keep them occupied - its a real family place
The food is good and you're not hurried out of your seat when you finish
Themed decorations like Haloween have really had effort put into them
A real neighbourhood place to go
It was the little things that upset us
The tap beer was flat
The bottom of the plates (for the garlic knots) were covered in chocolate from someone else's dessert
Overall, the food was great and the waitstaff very eager
Always the perfect slice, nice guys behind the counter, open super late -- I love it
however it is the best pizza in the east village
As an englishman living round the corner for 2 years, I got many visitors from home sleeping on my floor
I took them to experience many great eating places round the East Village, and there are 2 things my friends STILL talk about: the foccacia pizza from Muzzarella and the cheesecake from Veniero's
the BEST slice of pizza I had in New York!!
Absolutely the best slice in NYC
I've been in new york for many years and i've had it all
believe me
THIS place is the best
Venture into Alphabet City for a few drinks and grab yourself a slice along the way!!!!
This cute little hole-in-the-wall seriously has the best tasting slice ever! Yes, the pizza is really good at places like Lombardi's or Grimaldi's, but nothing compares to a plain slice at Muzzarella
The perfect sauce, cheese, and crust combo
The focaccia (sp?) is yummy too
Love this place
Best slice around
Sauce is great (not sweet like the one across the way from them)
Dough is excellent
In Short This distinctive bohemian bistro evokes Paris in the '20s--intellectuals, young and old, engage in deep conversation, and the closeness of the mismatched tables inspires talk among strangers
Soup bowl-sized mugs of coffee caffeinate the crowds, and an array of standard desserts--cheesecake, cookies, brownies and pie--keep the regulars coming
Bottled beer and wine are available, along with a menu of veggie burgers, pancetta-topped pizza, lasagna, sandwiches and salads
The service at this place is terrible, as is the food
I ordered breakfast there with a friend, a bagel and a croissant sandwich
Five minutes later, my friend got his food, while I had to wait over twenty minutes for mine
Not only did I see a customer get served who came after me, but when my order came it was *wrong* and beyond terrible
You'd think they'd know that most people don't like their eggs half-oiled, because that is exactly what my sandwich amounted to be--scrambled eggs with a side of oil (if I wanted an Egg McMuffin I would have gone to McD's
)
When I went to the front to ask the cashier if my food was ready, she said she thinks so and to wait for them to bring it
This place is decent for its coffee and for hanging out late at night
What I love about Pick Me Up is that anything I've ordered has always been very well made and very good, and the place maintains its low key/laid back/unpretentious atmosphere through the years
If you want to hide out in a cozy spot with a delicious cup/glass/plate of whatever, this is somewhere you'll feel just right
I ordered chai here thinking that I'd get the standard prefab Oregon Chai stuff
Not in the least
Rather, I got something delicious and homemade, barely sweetened, where I could taste the cardamom
It's excellent hot or iced, and the herbal version is good, too
(Oh yeah, and the cafe is a lovely place to sit and write/people-watch
)
inside this tiny cafe, you will find GREAT coffee
if the world was a better place, starbuck's would replace their wretched coffee with the beans from cafe pick me up
I recently met with friends at this cafe
I was enchanted with the cafe's cozy atmosphere, very nice choice of wines and a friend ordered a prosciutto- mozarella sandwich which was very good
The couple of hours we were there, in and out walked very fashionable, beautiful people, a lot of local artists, and I hear it's a low key hang out for some young celebs (Kevin Bacon Meg Ryan recently filmed a scene or two of a new movie here)
I was told their main room is closed due to construction (the space is at a nice corner location) but meanwhile I'll definitely go back to this little cafe with a lot of soul -- and great music too
I highly recommend this place
It's very atmospheric, inexpensive and always plays good music
There's also a good choice of wines (from $5 per glass), as well as any other beverage you could want
As for the food, i've only ever had the coffee crumb cake, but that was tasty
The best thing about Pick-me-Up is that you can sit there forever with a cup of coffee, no-one's in a rush to get you out
Great place to meet up for a drink and chill
It's one of those places where you sit and sit your cup of joe and imagine yourself transported
It could be the artistic vibe or the music playing over the speakers, the dim lighting and the rustic table and chairs, but I always think of being back in Paris
The hotties that are frequenting or walking by don't hurt either
First off, I have ZERO $ or affilation with this pizzeria - I just happen to live in the neighborhood
Bottom line - if you're looking for a good slice (I mean good New York, Italian pizza) this is the place
Beat all other in the area
Decor is less than desirable, but hey - it's a pizzaria
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you

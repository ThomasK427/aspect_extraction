Decor is as hot as the food! A Beautiful Crowd and a much needed restaurant in this area
Yummy food, affordable prices and the same friendly staff they have at Eatery
I tried their delivery for lunch this week at my office and it was a big success! Totally recommend it
I WAS SO EXCITED TO HEAR THAT THIS PLACE OPENED! I WORK AT HEARST AND THERE IS NOWHERE TO EAT
LUNCH SPECIAL FOR 9
95 WITH COFFEE OR SODA ROCKS
HAD THE VEGETARIAN LINQUINI AND WAS IMPRESSED
MY FRIEND LOVED HER CHOPPED SALAD
WE'LL BE BACK!
went here with my boyfriend and we both thaught it was a great find and a short walk to lincoln center
Tuna entree with edamama puree was a suggestion from the table next to us and boy what a good one
The cheesecake trilogy (a tasting with 3 different sauces) was great for the both of us to share

I need those chandeliers in my house!
Wonderful atmosphere and great food
Service was expert and curtious
It is a very comfortable place to have dinner and close enough to Lincoln Center to make it a great place to go before a concert
The people behind Eatery did it again with Whym
I had dinner there last night(brunch today at eatery of course)and my friends and I had a blast
The menu has somthing for evryone and we were not disapointed
The food and drinks held up to eatery's rep and the service was just as good if not better
The employees at both restaurants are so welcoming and realy enjoy what they are doing
It is so nice to now have TWO restaurants that are so friendly and have such great food
Keep up the good work
My fiends wanted to go to eatery for brunch today
We took a look at whyms brunch menu before we left last night and will be back to try it next weekend

My husband and I returned today from a 5 day trip to NYC with our 10 year old son and a group of friends
We meticulously researched restaurants based on location, reviews and price
We chose to try Whym on a Friday night with our son and one friend
The rest of our group went to a different restaurant
The food was some of the best and most creative we have ever tasted
My husband had the tuna and I had the blackened maui maui and it was the best fish I can remember eating
Although they normally do not have children, they were not only friendly to our son, but very accomodating and at no point did we feel uncomfortable about having him there
We ordered two desserts and the chef sent out a third that he was trying out that night
I am not sure what it was, but it was probably the most imaginative dessert my husband and I have had
It had all the best things in life in it
cream, gelato and peaches! We loved Whym so much we cancelled our reservations at another place on our last night and all of our friends went there with us
They all agreed it was the best restaurant they had gone to during the trip
Some ate at some pretty popular and expensive restaurants in New York
The only thing better than the food was the service
Chad was our waiter and he was friendly and helpful and made the evening fun without being intrusive
The staff at the front was outstanding
This will be a favorite for us in coming years and a favorite for all our friends, too
Thank you to Whym for creating a memorable trip to NY
I went to Whym on a blind date last week
I was so grateful that the food was amazing because my date was not
I had the Moroccan Spiced Halibut for dinner and the chocolate cake for dessert
Impressed with the wine selection also
I'll be back
but with another date
I'VE LIVED IN THE AREA FOR 8 YEARS AND IT'S NICE TO FINALLY HAVE A RELIABLE FRIENDLY SPOT TO VISIT
BRUNCH EGGS WERE PERFECT FOR ME AND OUR FAMILY AND THE BURGERS ARE VERY GOOD TOO
PEACH PARFAIT IS A MUST ALSO
Menu limited
food not great and surely not much to eat except for the chips that fill the plate and stomach
Salad my two fellow dinners had much tastless
very disappointing
should have eaten at the Eatery their sister company
business must be slow as air conditioning was set to a comfortable level noting a need to cost corners
Need to change something
I've been living near columbus circle for so long and finally an affordable good restaurant opens! freindly hosts and fun staff makes this place my newest hangout
I love the tuna entree and their chocolate cake is awesome
We also went to brunch recently and my dad loved the place
Went here for my b-day dinner
I think there are many restaurants in the immediate proximity that serve better food and has better services
Ordered the onion tart and chopped salad for appetitizers
Both were better than the entrees, Long Island Duck and sea scallopp specaials
Duck was too salty and the crispy rolled noodle in seaweed was soggy
Scallopp was nothing specatcular
Decided to try out this new joint and was pleased with the outcome
Trendy restaurant with great food! To top it off, our waiter had a great sense of humor and his recommendations were honest (he actually said some of the dessert choices were no good!)
Must try the baby arugula salad
simply amazing! Great food for a great price too
Gorgeous dining room that first attracts you, then a fun funky menu that definately pleases
Professional service, great wine cocktail list
We will be back!!!!!
The #1 draw besides the beautiful design is the terrific service staff
In a city where pretentions can run high, the staff at Whym is attentive and friendly
Our food was beautiful to look at and just as delicious and I and my date were thoroughly impressed
I've already recommended it to friends and coworkers
I am a big Eatery fan, so when I heard these guys opened a new spot - I wanted to check it out
They raised the bar on 9th Avenue again! The food was amazing(mushroom tortellini is a must try) , drinks were fun and the staff is warm and helpful from the minute you walk in to the minute they walk you out
Great date spot
I went back for brunch last weekend and had the same positive experience
Not only was the food wonderful again
they actually remembered me from my dinner visit
That kind of personal attention is hard to find here in NY
Excellent!
Sexy Mushrooms? the answer is oh Yes! Cool Funky menu, good prices and in a much needed location
I am very surprsied at the neg

Went last night and everything was great -very friendly staff - when my pregnant friend asked for a fun non-alcholoic drink the waiter enthusiastically made a great concoction and really cared whether she enjoyed it
He made wonderful suggestions and even gave us some complimentary onion rings
The food, without exception was fresh, and flavorful with interesting combinations that worked well
Even though it was very crowded we did not feel rushed at all
Worth the trip
I will be back
I had such a great experience at WHYM

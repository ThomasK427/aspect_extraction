I have no idea why this restaurant was listed as a new and notable restaurant
When we were sat in a booth there was a plastic cup with a half finished soda in it
The food was good, not great
Our waiter acted like he just stepped out of his how to be a cheesy waiter class
The decor felt like we could have been anywhere, USA
There are so many unique and spectacular dining experiences in NYC
This one felt unexceptional
We made a Friday night reservation two days earlier on a Wednesday
The reservation was for 9:30pm (the only time available) for two people
When our concierge called on the Friday night, just to check the address, she was told that they had no such reservation
long story short, at no point did they even TRY to accomodate us, or suggest we go and wait for a table
They basically told us their was nothing they could do
We went anyway at 8:30pm, just to see how crowded it was, and were told that there was a 40 minute wait for a table for two! Needless to say, I would not give them my business, I will never give them my business, and I am going to tell everyone I know to do the same
Went with a fellow girlfriend after hearing rave reviews of the place
Was not disappointed at all!! The procuitto plate, though a bit small, was delicate and flavourful
Our orders of steak and ravioli were amazing -- would definitely come back again!! Waitress wasn't terribly knowledgeable about the extensive wine list
Dessert was not very memorable
Our night was delightful! Not only was the food spectacular and the ambience agreeable, the staff was made up of some of the friendliest folks in Manhattan! It was refreshing to go to a restaurant that made you feel as if they really appreciated your business rather than the usual you're lucky we let you eat here
I'll be a regular before they know it!
I was looking forward to going to this restaurant
I was very disappointed
The atmosphere is nice, but the food was terrible
I had the spaghetti carbonara and it was the saltiest thing i have ever eaten
I will never go back again
We were very much looking forward to go to Crispo
From the outside, it looked like it had all the elements for success
We made reservations for 8pm, but they could not fit us in until 8:30pm
No problem
We showed up anyway at 8pm to have a drink at the bar
the hostess was very friendly
When at the bar, we were not served by the two bartenders
don't really no the reason
When we sat, it took way too long for the waiter to come over
The resaurant was loud and the tables were way too close to one another
We kept on being banged into/bumped by anyone that was walking by
Food was decent, but it was not a pleasant dining experience
Crispo definitely looks like an old farmhouse, but it doesn't have the charm or ambiance of an old farmhouse
Unappealing to say the least
Winning combination of friendly/chic ambience and fantastic food! Nice but not too dressy, this charming Chelsea made an impact on me
The food was phenomenal- brought me back to Tuscany with that olive oil
I was seated in the 3 table alcove which made for an intimate experience
I like to try new places but this one makes the favorites list
Loved it
Filled with great atmosphere, an unpretentious chic-y crowd, great lighting and fabulous food
Great wine list - either by the glass or bottle
Appetizer through dessert was tasty and enjoyable
Our server was knowledgeable and helpful with his suggestions
I felt like any moment Martin Scorsese could walk through the door
The food is pretty good, the place is nice looking and comfortable and the prices are about as reasonable as you could possibly ask for
Frank Crispo is brilliant
His food is amazing
The best appetizers in New York
Entree's are not as good as the appetizes, but are close
The service is a little raw, but they are extremely pleasant and obviously trying their best
At new restaurants this often happens
The ambiance is excellent and everything in the restaurant has a story
I have been back 3 times and each time gets better
I strongly recommend Crispo's
Crispo sounded great from the description that was written about the restaurant
We were seated prompty as we had a reservations, but then again, it was early
I ordered a coke and sent it back after it was flat and then my gingerale was flat so I sent that back
needless to say, I settled for water
My fiance and I both ordered fish and both were as bland and uninteresting as any can be
To top it all off, we were sitting in the front where they had open ceiling to floor windows and had outside pan handlers coming by to grovel for money and cigarettes
Not such a pleasant experience nor meal
Would not recommend it to anyone
Loved it
looks great from the outside and very cozy intimate from the inside! Being from Italy I cant say it's really italian food
but whatever it was, was great! It reminded me decore wise of Pastis Candela
It was rather loud but that did not bother me
as it added charm to the cozy intimate room
I owuld go back indeed!
Fun, Fun, Fun - great for after work dining - loud but worth it
Food is delicious
I have been 4 times already and it gets better each time, this place is soon to be a New York landmark
the food is great, the service has improved 100% from the first visit
the food is very close to Lupa
All I can say is look out Mario this guy has you beat!  Bravo! Crispo
Was greeted and seated with no attitude from the host and hostess, despite no reservation
Attentive service from the waiter who kept returning to make sure everything was okay, in a completely unannoying way
The food was delicious, particularly the spaghetti carbonara, served in a novel way (for me)
And a meaty grilled portabella
And the prices won't kill you
I am extremely impressed with Crispo
The food is fabulous
The prociutto with the black mission figs and parmesan cheese is a wonderful first course as well as the perfectly tender calamari with the slightly spicy marina
The skate with rosemary and mandarin was cooked to a perfect med rare temp
Romantic atmosphere with a couple of private rooms and unpretentious winelist and well educated staff
I love Crispo and highly recommend it!
The Scene Awash in tones of blue and beige, with arching walls that mimic rolling waves, this large L-shaped room is anchored by a glassed-in kitchen
In the early evening, a local business crowd holds forth followed by a well-heeled downtown set
Servers seem to employ a zone defense: Every time a diner makes a move, in swoops a different employee
The Food The menu is creative yet avoids the kind of overcomplication that plagues many fish houses
Sauteed grey sole is prepared with a nutty brown meuniere sauce, and a perfectly deep-fried flounder benefits from a gingery soy broth
One of the best main courses is a buttery salmon filet set over sweet baby eggplant and caramelized treviso
The most outlandish sounding dish on the menu turns out to be one of the best: succulent roasted halibut cheeks alongside seared fois gras set over a roasted peach in balsamic vinegar
Disappointments are minor, like the awkwardly thick slab of tuna belly in lemony soy vinaigrette
I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing, really good meal
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them

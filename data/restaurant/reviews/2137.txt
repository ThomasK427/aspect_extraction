As for the rudeness- I don't know whatyou are talking about because I have never seen any of the staff be anything but accomodating
TRY IT ITS AWESOME
Extremely good dumplings every single time I've been there
The staff is sweet, the noodle soups are wonderful, the cold sesame noodles are great, but the general chinese dishes are only soso
The barbecue spare ribs is THE best in any restuarant I've tried
The number of different noodles and dumplings they offer are all delicious and distinct in their own way
They have steamed, fried ,vegetable ,pork
beef and seafood dumplings and many different types of noodles
I am a regular at Noodles on 28 and had tried many dishes over a period of 9 years
The management religiously pays close attention to the freshness and cleanliness of the food and establishment
They strive to bring you the freshest,tastiest ,urban ,hip new generation of chinese food to you, minus the traditional oil sogged msg filled chinese food of the past
In addition to the great food there is a spectacular ,beautifull 6 feet japanese koi aquarium for you and the kids to enjoy!
Best of the best
To name a few exceptionally wonderful dishes, the House Dumpling Combo, a sampling of assortment of dumplings with sesame sauce are awesome, I can have them everyday
General Tso's Chicken and Pineapple Chicken are delicioussssssssssssssssss, just can't have enough
The spring rolls are very crisp and not greasy like many other
House Steak Hong Kong style and Grand Marnier Shrimp are excellent and my favorites
Great atmosphere for group dining and with friend
Certainly one of the best restaurants in this category
Oustanding food and the most responsive service in NY!
It's a Chinese food restaurant, so decor and service aren't much to speak of, but this is probably the best Chinese food you're going to find
The most important aspect here is that the food is fresh: crispy veggies, moist and tender chicken, fluffy rice
You never realize how bad most Chinese food is until you order from Noodles on 28th, and realize how good it CAN be
It's a bit more expensive than your average Chinese, but it's worth it (unless, of course, you enjoy stomach cramps from bad Chinese food)
After many years of eating here every dish has always been delicious
For Vegitarians there is a very good selection of mock meats including Vegetarian Duck!
They have the best steamed chicken and vegetable dumplings in NYC
They are a must with the special sesame sauce wich is peanut, soy, and just plain amazing!
In Short "Home of the 7 ounce burger," boasts the menu, and indeed this smallish, wood-paneled incarnation of the Jackson Hole chain has burgers galore: beef, chicken, or veggie, and topped with any of several dozen options including guacamole, ham, mushrooms, onions, and even a fried egg
But there's a world beyond the burger: chicken sandwiches with a similar cornucopia of topping choices; entree-sized salads; a Mexican corner; specialty sandwiches; and more
If you want burger fatter than Indiana girl's behind, then this is the place
Huge variety of gourmet burgers and sides
Cute interior and nice wait staff
A nice place to kick back with friends and down a few brewskis
I don't get this place either
The service was alright, but could have been quicker
But, it's the food that could have also been better
For what I paid, I expected TASTE
Pickles in a bowl
But, my nose wrinkled up moreso when my bacon burger came
The huge, huge slab of meat on a patty was too bland for words
poor animals they had to harm to create this slop
makes me want to go vegetarian
I do, however, reccomend this restaurant for something small like sharing hot cocoa and fries with a friend
Or sharing an ice cream with a friend
I expected a huge amount of ice cream, for what I ordered (the hells kitchen sundae), only to recieve it in a drinking cup
I don't consider this a huge amount, but it was good at least
So to each their own
Sorry, I wouldn't reccomend them
Burger sucked, meat has no flavor
Anyone can make a big burger and almost everyone makes one that is better than their's
For the price


i expected at least a burger that has some flavor The bun was falling off and the burger was too big to enjoy
The key to a perfect burger is meat, size, and favlor
My boyfriend ordered fried chicken
Came out fried outside but completely cold inside
Sent back and came back again the same
Waitress was very apologetic but the food was unbearable
Basically not consumable
I went here = the service is pretty good
But then again, I went with someone who frequents the place and knows the staff very well
The food is average
The hamburger's are extremely huge mondo burgers (Ever see the movie Good Burger? well, this is the mondo burger baby)
The hamburger's just are too dry and bland so they're not really juicy at all
I enjoyed my bun and my heaping plate of fries much better
:)  I also reccomend the Hell's Kitchen Sundae :)   This place is good and the staff is friendly
However, the menu choices are so awkward
Like if you order something, it comes out weird
Buffalo wings become fried chicken wings
The Hell's Kitchen Sundae (although very yummy) is warned to be huge
I had a good sundae
But it came in a soda cup
Interesting
Not only did everything did everything come wrong the first time, but upon their second attempt it was still wrong
Additionally, the burger was burnt, not just overcooked, but actually black - BOTH TIMES
The fries and Onion rings were wet, soggy, and cold
I have never had a bad experience from this place in my life, but getting something wrong twice makes this place dead to me
I will never order in from here again and am writing this to get out my frustration about my awful meal, hoping that someone will not make the same mistake!!!!
I tried the Jackson Hole on 82nd street and the burgers were delicious and the side dishes were the best
I guess is depends on which Jackson Hole you go to
every Jackson Hole has its own cook and the one on 82nd is on the money!!!!
I can't believe this place is ranked 2nd! I went there last night because I saw the rating and its pretty close to my office
The burger was horrible
Totally flavorless chopmeat that was steamed and put on a bun
Thr fried onions were below average for flavor and quality
The only thing you could possibly say that is not bad about the burgers here is that they are huge, but other than that they are horrible
I just want to know who is giving this place this kind of rating??? If you want a good burger got to Boxer's on W4th between 6th and 7th
After taking a look to the ranking i went to Jackson Hole yesterday
I thought I would run into the best burger in town, but I didn't
I can't deny that it is a very good burger, and it should be in the top 20s
but definitively not 2nd in th ranking
my only complain was the size of each order
if you are going to enjoy a burger it should be easy to grab it with your hands and eat it
this is not the case
I was fortunate enough to meet the worst waitress I have ever had at this establishment
I can't say enough bad things about this place
The burgers were disgusting, the fries were soggy, I had to get my own beverage from the counter because my waitress couldn't be bothered
Awful just awful

The Ben and Jacks steaksauce is a very good choice to complement the steak
The lamb chops were also very tender
The individualized service and friendliness of the staff made the evening complete
I have been here many times and the steak has always been fantastic
The peas onion and mushroom sides are always delicious
The staff is very helpful
The decor is kind of odd and it can be VERY loud
Nothing to brag about
It's good steak at a nice restaurant with very good service and a good wine list
Steaks are very good portioned, but they do have lots of fat
Service was ok but the wine that was suggested was outstanding
I do love my steak cajun but was unable to get my request at this steakhouse
Other than that it's pretty average
Very good steak, and overall I would recommend it if you are in the neighborhood, or everywhere else is booked
The home fries were also excellent
We did not like the bread (would have prefferred it to be warm), and the salads were doused with too much dressing
The Maitre D was excellent and the service was good
Was not a fan of the ambience; too bright, felt a little like a cruise ship (although to be fair, it was a slow Sunday night, maybe its better when its more crowded
We were looking for somethign different from the other steak houses in the city and ran across this gem
They sat 10 of us in a private room with excellent service and great food
Across the board very pleased with everything
Ben Jack's Steakhouse is an amazing place! The food is absolutely delicious and so appetizing
The atmoshpere offers for a great night out and dining experience
Best steakhouse I've been to in NY, I've been to most of them
bacon is amazing and the porterhouse is the best, while it's expensive, it's actually pretty reasonable for a steakhouse
My recent visit was the worst experience (this year) when it comes to food business
Long wait for our meal (approx 30 minutes), unusual slow service, waitresses (especially the preety one with black hair) louder thn clients, do not care much for customers
Food - nothing special accept fancy names
5 (in scale 1-10) Place looks OK but there are better restaurants in the vicinity
This place is great
I eat here at least once a week
The price is right for a quality meal
The ribs are awesome
The mac and bleu cheese is worth a visit alone
The sweet potato croquettes are to die for
If the spaghetti is available, get it
The staff has always been friendly and the chef is as personable as they come
A great date spot with many affordable wine options
Note: I have never written a bad review
However, this one I cannot avoid
IN SHORT: Burgers ordered medium were served raw- literally red and cold inside
The chef insisted that the meat was cooked properly!? and gave attitude and mean looks from the kitchen (I swear) when I requested to have it recooked
When returned the meat was STILL raw
Despite a big scene (re: the uncooked meat) involving several of the staff members (which was quite distracting), the owner did nothing
(I will say, the waitress was very sweet and did try to compensate for the chef and owner's poor beh- we gave her a big tip)
Frankly, there are too many great restaurants in this neighborhood
BTW, this happened twice-I do believe in second chances, just not third ones
Have been going to different restaurants in this area for about two years now and this is by far the best
I have been here on two occassions and both times I was very impressed
The staff is very friendly, the food is great and the atmosphere is just right for a quiet dinner for two
It started filling up around 8:30 which was still good just a little noiser
Found this place on citysearch when my boyfriend and I wanted to try something different and we were pleasantly surprised! We started our meal with the Cobb salad and the lobster bisque (had originally ordered the calamari but returned it), next we had the ocean broil and the barbeque spare ribs
Both courses were elegantly presented and fabulously prepared
Dessert, however was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal
I had the mango cheesecake that was refreshing and served on a plate with mango and strawberry puree


delicious! My boyfriend had the strawberry shortcake, a dish that's ordinarily boring but here, very unique and very delicious, not too sweet and topped with decadent homemade whipped cream
Went here on New Year's day with a hankering for fried chicken
We were pleasantly surprised to find this place - a sweet and well thought interior and a great menu to match
Tried the lobster bisque made with a tomato base which was so refreshing from the usual bland cream laden style
Nice chunks of lobster as well
A friend tried the shrimp with goat cheese and tomato - a perfectly matched trio and unbelievably tasty! Then, the fried chicken - a huge portion well coated and fried nice and crispy
The amazing bacon and chive mashed potatoes and the homemade cole slaw were great sides
That cole slaw was enough to go back for alone
We are so happy to find another great place to add to our growing list
Will be back with more friends!
Went here recently for a quick casual diner at the last minute
Very pleased with my choice
In a neighborhood of many good, little resturants this is one of the best
Nice diverse menu with something for everyone
In our group no one was disappointed
And the price - just right
I was just walking on Court Street and noticed LB's menu and knew immediately it would be perfect for my mood that evening
My husband and I were not dissapointed, as everything was great - food, service and ambience
I'll go out on a limb: All things considered, this is the best restaurant in the Brooklyn Heights/Boerum Hill/Carroll Gardens area
We were a party of 4 that came here for a pre-theatre dinner (the 2/3 train is only 10-15 minute walk) on a Sunday evening
Fussy New Yorkers: N
B
: The waitstaff new how to advise the table! Their recommendations were followed and everyone was very happy, no unpleasant surprises
Dinner for a party of four with a nice Chilean wine $175 and worth every penny
(It's not a big space be but the restaurauteur seemed to have made excellent do with the space available)
I was conflicted about whether to rave about this place and watch it become crowded with higher prices or keep it a wonderful neighborhood secret
Great food, reasonably priced, very impressive
The Monday blue plate special of broiled lobster with guacamole corncakes for $16 is great as are the short ribs and salmon
We had a party of 8 (made reservations) and applauded the crew when we left! The selection is fantastic; there's something for the carnivorous, the seafood lovers, the vegetarians
We chose from a broad spectrum of menu options and all agreed this was 4-star fare at 2-star prices
Even the presentations make you feel like you're splurging on a big culinary event
Please support this restaurant
they totally deserve their accolades! Did I mention the wines are spectacular????? Go!
This is a very good restaurant where you get great food for the money! Four of us ate here and ended up paying $150 including tip and two bottles of GREAT wine! Service is excellent and food ditto
The only thing I didn't like was the lack of space
It could e bigger and the music was slightly loud, but nevertheless an absolutely awesome place! Highly recommended!
My friends and I decided to stop by this newly opened restaurant in our neighborhood and I must admit I was very impressed
The prices were very reasonable
The baby back ribs were amazing, and I definitely would recommend the corn and squash soup that i had that night
We broke with tradition and went out for Thanksgiving
We went to this charming little place with a big fireplace (that's filled with candles, hmm) and it was quiet and the staff were very nice and accomodating
Corn bread pudding was a little dry but the huge plate of turkey was very good
Sweet potato, mashed potato, brussels sprouts, white meat, dark, meat, stuffing, and a thin dark gravy

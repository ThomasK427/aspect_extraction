We were nervous it was going to be a trendy place with mediocre food but were surprised how good the food was
Great prices, food, service, ambience
very chic and trendy
Great place to chill with your friends or take a nice date
Waiters were pretty cute too
Drinks were huge and well worth the price
Great food - you can eat and drink like pigs for about $40 / person
it more than exceeded my expectations
i came to celebrate my husband's birthday
we were a party of 8
i had been here with some girlfriends for drinks before, but never had dinner
it's one of the best values in this area
some of the best thai food i've had in the city
what i really appreciated was the friendly service knowledgeable staff
you can't always find that in this city
i do recommend making reservations for parties of 6 or more
it gets quite crowded on the weekends
all in all it was good eats, good times and a fun atmosphere
I went to Highline with a group of 4 for a birthday dinner on Saturday, Nov
6th and heard about the place from a co-worker
I would suggest making reservations and being prompt as the restaurant does get packed after 7:30 pm
We ordered vegetarian dishes only, and the good dishes were the pad thai noodles, tamarind nut dish, and the basil tofu dish, along with the hard crusted spring rolls for appetizers
The waitress suggested a nice sauvignon blanc to go with our dinner
If you are a vegetarian concerned about fish and chicken broth, double check in advance if the offerings are okay for your standards
All in all, I thought it was a great dining experience, and would even consider it for a dinner date earlier in the night when it's quieter
My boyfriend and I went there on a reccomendation
It was amaizing
Not too expensive, great food and cool atmosphere
I would go back in a heart beat
We also got seated right away at a table for two
If you want to go with a big group make a reservation
Best thai/pan asian fusion I've had in the city (it's not your typical thai restaurant)
friends had suggested i check out highline
they were pleasantly surprised at how friendly and unpretentious the service was, for a restaurant in the meatpacking district, so i figured i'd give it a shot
i have to admit it exceeded my expectations
not only was the hostess at the door friendly approachable, the waiter was professional well informed about the menu
he gave great suggestions
try the entree--'cast iron' shrimp, both delicious healthy! mojitos are also really good huge! i have to admit that they should do something about the lighting for the waterfall--it's pretty, but the lighting is such that you can't tell it's there if you're having dinner inside
it's practically invisible on the 2nd floor, but it looks great downstairs as it falls into the pool in the 'pool lounge'
New York chic without condescention
We have been coming regularly for some time, but recently were pleasantly surprised to see that Highline has added a line of refreshingly new items to the menu
Try Fall Rolls - delicately soft and healthily refreshing or the Double Red Fish, a red snapper with spicy red sauce
We also recommend trying the special of the day - there is always something new and unexpected
I went for lunch on a Saturday and the food was excellent
I ordered a fairly typical thai dish but the execution and presentation were well done
The restaurant's design is quite nice
Luckily, Highline's owners recognize that a great space alone can't sell a restaurant forever
I went to Highline tonight with my boyfriend in the mood for a good thai food
We were kinda disappointed at first when we came because of the slow service
We got our seats right away however we waited for about 10 minutes before somebody asked us what we wanted to drink
But when the food started coming, I couldn't stop eating
I had the best beef satay with peanut sauce for appetizer, basil plate with chicken and the best part of them all, the sticky chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert (don't forget too the green tea cheesecake)
The food is really good and so is the ambience and the waiters turned out to be really nice
I would definitely recommend this place for great food and ambience
the 10 minutes wait was really worth it
I was there with my friends on Tuesday night
This place has 3 floors that have pretty impressive design
Especially their 2nd floor that feels very smooth,heaven and gay like
Once we walked in,the hostess seated us quite properly
However,the music was really rushing while the restaurant was half empty
Worst thing of all,we waited 20 minutes for appetizers and a half hour for our entrees
The food was good
I do not know if it's because of we waited for the food for so long or it was really good
Our waiter came up to apologize about the kitchen service so many times
(Great service from the waiter by the way)
Also,please beware of rude manager
Overall,it's a good place to have dinner and hang out if you do not mind waiting for food,weird music and rude manager
It would be one of the most fascinating restaurants if they could fix these problems according to the ambient and value
The ambiance oh Highline is very soothing and creative while the food is delicious and well worth the money
The satay peanut sauce is the best I have had
If you are in the meatpacking district and in the mood for Thai, this is a rare find
Great for your money
This restaurant will be packed with all kinds of people
Great food and ambient
A bit slow and uncare service
But good for your bucks
Do not expect to be treated like a king as many restaurants in the area do
GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!
Great place
New in the meatpacking district
It's not really on the way to anything else, so you have to know it's there to find it
That's why it probably was pleasantly uncrowded, unusual for the ultra trendy area
Food is great, service fantastic, and the space is very cool
It won't be long before it's overflowing with upper east siders, so go now!
We just had a lovely, lovely late lunch in the Highline
service was so friendly, we couldn't stop marvel (that's rare, admit it!), and the food was delicious! decor is ultra modern yet really comfy (again, rare
right?)
prices are very reasonable
we recommend!
I stopped by Highline this weekend after reading about in the Times
I was very pleased
It is another hip meatpacking restaraunt, but I didn't feel like I had to be a fake hipster to eat there
Food was great - loved the Pad Thai spring rolls and the green tea cheesecake
Service was really helpful
Overall, definitely a thumbs up
Will absolutely return
The Scene Orchids abound
They're submerged in cylindrical glass vases in the small bar area; in the dining room, they climb up teak posts surrounding a bottom-lit pool
Jewel-toned raw-silk curtains and teak lattice, used to break up the boxy space, add further intrigue
Service in the dining room is well-tuned and well-versed in the nuances of the menu

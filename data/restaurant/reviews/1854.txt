After moving uptown and trying other Mexican restaurants closer to my new area, I realized the quality of the food at Mexican Radio
I have not yet found any other restaurant in Manhattan where it is paralleled
The tacos, chimichangas, enchiladas, and tamales are all so authentic and so good
You must try it!
One word - Disappointing
The food was only ok--nothing special
Big portions don't make it any better
The guac, just ok, my enchillidas, pedestrian, the bill, way too high for what was delivered
One last gripe, WTF is going on with a $13 margarita in a small glass?? McRipoff
If I'm going to get fleeced on drinks, let's make it up with better atmosphere
Wen here last month
This really should be under the $$ category
The average price of a meal (app, entree, 1 drink and tip) is probably around $28
The decor is wonderful, right up to the bathrooms!!!! The staff was very attentive to my party even though the place was packed
The food is delicious and they serve huge portions, so get ready to get stuffed
Try the rasberry margaritas -- I might have found heaven
I recently held my boyfriend's birthday party here
After making a reservation for many more people than actually showed up, the hostess was very kind in adjusting our arrangements and sat us in a nice cool basement (very welcome on a hot summer day)
The drinks were great, the food was even better
I'm not sure why CitySearch puts this place in the $$$ category when none of the meals were over $16
This is one of the best darn restaurants in NYC! The margaritas are great (they use fresh lime juice), the food is good (especially the Radio Roll-Ups and the Raspberry Mole - together!) and the decor is festive, but by far the best part of it is the people who work there -the bartenders and waiters - they are such a nice and fun group of people! I first ate at Mexican Radio back in September and I had such a great experience that I have been going back almost weekly since
I highly recommend this place for almost any occasion, but it does get crowded, so make a reservation
And if you do have any problems, just tell them and they will take care of you - if they don't know about a problem, they can't fix it!
stopped in radio for the first time
luved the cozy atmosphere and deco
the food was great! having been in the service industry myself, i found the service was slow and unattentive--but the food and ambiance do make up for it! recommend checking it out!
The food was delicious but the service was awful
Expect great, authentic mexican, but don't expect water refills or your order to be correct
not a big fan of the service or the ambience, but the food is amazing, especially considering its not terribly over priced, and later, when the lights down down, its one of my favorite makeout nooks
Four of us stumbled into Mexican Radio on Dec
26, not exactly a heavy traffic day
Well, maybe the head chef had nothing better to do
We four had an absolutely wonderful late meal
The shrimp burrito with raspberry mole was a sublime blend of fruityness, chocolate and spice
Very much a value meal
Great bar, and the staff were first rate
admittedly missing the cozy ambiance when mexican radio was on elizabeth, i am happy they found a new home, but sooo disappointed in what it has become ! the food is still awesome - the twist on mexican is perfect - but the service is terrible - from the apathetic hosts to the unbelievably slow servers
the margaritas and bloody marys are still among the best in the city, so get rocked while waiting !
Hands down the best Mexican food in NYC
Go for the chimichengas or the burritos! Great guac too!
Mexican Radio is great place for lunch
It tends to be very crowded at night since it's in Soho
The food is pretty typical Americanized Mexican fare
Nothing spectacular---but the food is tasty and filling
The staff is hip, but friendly
And this place is good place to grab drinks and a small bite after work before the dinner people swarm in
Finally - a mexican food joint where the bartendars aren't afraid of tequila
They understand it, they respect it, and they are damn goodlooking to boot
The atmosphere is beautiful and authentic; from the punched tin mirrors to beautifully executed chile rellanos
The burritos are as big as your face and the downstairs is a perfect hideaway for large groups
Now, if we can get real queso on the menu, I may never need to go to San Antonio again
Best Mexican food in NYC
I love mexican radio from their killer margs, to their steamy enchiladas
The prices are good, but the margs are a little expensive
For $10, I can't have as many as I'd like to!!
THe food was great
we got sat a little late
which would have bothered me had it not been for the very big very strong margarieta's
The decor was great the service was ok
and it was a bit loud, but the volume definitely goes with the young fun atmosphere!
Remember that tiny tiny place around the corner? THAT was the Mexican Radio my friends and I loved
When we heard they were moving it to a larger location, we all feared we would lose everything we loved
Well, as predicted, the new location is larger, louder, less friendly, and a little more expensive
On the up side, you can get seats without drinking yourself silly at the bar (wait IS that a good thing?)
The food is still excellent, including a wide menu selection and mouth-watering specials
If you frequented the old location, however, I'll bet you feel the way I do: I miss it
That homemade sangria, the smiles of the 3 employees, and the conversation with people at adjoining tables are gone
The Scene It's date-central in the back dining room, where, as the evening wears on, the canoodling gets increasingly less discreet
Seats up front--especially at the sushi bar--are best for those who enjoy watching the swift, masterful movements of the sushi chefs
Since it's a favorite with just about every sushi lover in the city, the restaurant is nearly always packed with everyone from suits to Soho locals dressed in whatever suits their mood
The Food Order anything listed on the fresh sheet, even alarming-sounding fish like Japanese horse mackerel--a larger, buttery, less fishy cousin of the ubiquitous sushi standby
Exotic-sounding jellyfish is actually quite tame--rice noodle-like strands tossed in vinegar
The combination sushi plates are the real draw, and, from the salmon to the cod, all the fish is extremely fresh and proportional
There are numerous creative rolls to fill up on as well
Great spot for sushi
Their Miso soup is by far my favorite here
Only downfall is that they do not take reservations so you usually do have to wait for a table because everyobe else has discovered its good too
Coolest thing ever
We're eating our sushi and there's a small window next to our table were a tiny japanese maple is planted
We see a m0use run inside the tree and stare at us for a while and scamper off
He didn't want any sashimi I guess
Blue Ribbon is great
How can you complain about top notch sashimi and sake at 1AM
I'm not going to say this haute dining or innovative, it's standard rolls, nigiri, and so forth
Although I did see red snapper on the menu--a rare one
Try one of everything
Not cheap, but not over the top either
Right in the upper middle where you start to question whether it was worth it
At 1am with a cute m0use in the tree, we got our money's worth
Very good, nice selection
Very fresh
Long wait but worth it!
Blue Ribbon is a wonderful place for Sushi a great time
Once you score a seat, you won't want to leave
I come here with my crew for a wonderful meal atmosphere
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent
However, the value and service are both severely lacking
Portions contain less fish than one would expect, particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in NYC (Masa excluded, of course)
Furthermore, while the fish is unquestionably fresh, rolls tend to be inexplicably bland
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive

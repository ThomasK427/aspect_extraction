I was there for New Year's and they had two seatings where they served complimentary Champagne
It was great we had a party of 13 and they never missed a beat
Alex and Jared Keep up the Good Work!
We went to Sorrel for dinner recently for a birthday celebration and was extremely disappointed
The birthday girl was unhappy with her order of the lamb shank and requested the fish dinner
The waiter took the order away and returned to the table with the same order of the lamb that was just recently refused advising that there was no more fish and said to her YOU HAVE TO EAT IT
We decided to speak to the chef which was where it went further downhill, he was rude, unaccommodating and told us IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT GET OUT
After such horrible treatment and still starving we did the best thing we could of done for the evening and went to Restaurant GIA's where the service and the food was delightful
Upon entering this restaurant, I really liked the ambience
I was a bit taken aback by the paper napkins and the flyer like menu, but was excited nevertheless to taste the food praised by at least 6 people on this site
We ordered Salmon and the lamb shank/leg for dinner ---the salmon was ok but the lamb was tasteless and almost rank (lamb is a great meat but requires the right seasoning)
The waiter asked what was wrong with it and reluctantly took it back to the kitchen only to bring it right back out
To make a long story short, the chef subsequently came out and said IF YOU DONT LIKE IT
GET OUT! I am serious and still recovering
I am a well traveled person who enjoys eating at good restaurants
I have never had an experience like this and I am therefore compelled to write this review
My husband and I took my father to Sorrel last weekend and we all loved it
My dad ordered the beef tenderloin and proclaimed it the best he'd ever had--and he's had a lot of beef tenderloin in his day
My husband ordered the fish of the day, as part of the prix-fixe menu, and finished every last morsel with delight
The chocolate mousse for dessert was among the best I've ever had, and I'm a harsh judge of chocolate desserts
Overall, the prix-fixe menu cannot be beat
And our host/waiter was wonderful--very warm, attentive, and knew a lot about wine
The selection he recommended was perfect
My husband I tried this new place last weekend
He had a prefix and I had a duck
The duck was the best I've ever had in my life
The food was excellent and the place was packed and full of energy
Loved the wine list as well
We'll definetely come back!!
As a former Manhattanite, it's so great to be in a neighborhood where Chefs want to strut their stuff but minus all the pretentiousness
As a food and restaurant lover, Sorrel very much welcomed and needed to up the ante of restaurants in Brooklyn
A dining beacon in an otherwise residential 4 or 5 block radius, Sorrel pleases on every course--from the cold spicy tomato soup and beet salad starters to the delectable skate, the scallops, or steak tartare, straight through to the strange but tasty melon soup or flan-esque orange-and-caramel custard (so bad with names)
You hardly notice that service is a tiny bit slow or that the room is a tad too brightly lit
I had a very good experience at this restaurant
It is fairly new, so it wasnt too crowded, but there was enough people there to add to the ambiance
The food was great and the $25 fixed menu is a deal! The entrees seem to change daily, but the sides, like the mash potatos were great and stay the same
If they have seared scallops, go for it! Seems like it will be the next big thing for that neighborhood, I just wished I lived closer so I could go more often
Without question, you need to try this place
Their menu changes almost daily (if not daily) and it is guided by whatever fresh produce/meat they can get their hands on
Everything was super tasty and it's nice to not pay outrageous prices for it
Manhattanites, don't be afraid to go out and explore brooklyn
I was at first - but it turned out to be a fantastic move
I've never used the word 'amazing' before to describe a food experience in NY but I have to agree with the earlier reviewer
Everything we had was amazing--the spicey carrots were a revelation (spicy, yes, usual curry, no), the green falafel sandwich was light yet filling
The individual falafel were filled with cliantro, parsley, and mint pesto centers that burst forth when you bit into them
Lunch was actually fun for my mouth! The lemon and orange italian sodas were a nice change--not too sweet, just flavorful
In a mere 15 minutes, our stomachs and spirits were restored
We left happy and smiled all the way home
I'm always looking for good falafel and this by far was the best I ever had
Perfectly spiced and made on the spot
The sevice was very friendly and curtious and I hade a date smoothie that was out of this world
My friend had the sabich and found that outstanding as well
It's a shame the place isn't bigger, there are only a few stools and a counter
I was absolutely amazed at how great and fresh the falafel was - and they have three different flavors (Spicy Harissa for me)
Everything is prepared fresh and it was worth waiting five minutes to get piping hot, delicious falafel
The hummus, tahini and Israeli salad were all tasty and fresh
The home-made, crispy french fries were honestly the best I have ever tasted
The service was friendly and efficient
I will definitely be coming back to eat at 'Taim'!
Superlative lattes and fun breakfast items, like brazilian cheese bread stuffed with scrambled eggs, almond friands, Pennsylvania Dutch sticky buns
Lots of options for those with wheat allergies -- my toddler adores this place
Also love their sandwiches, veggies with tuscan white bean spread and Vietnamese pork are my faves
The best espresso in the city
Really delicious pastries and cheese breads
A great place for cappuccinos and mochas, they make everything in the store, including the syrups -- with all natural ingredients
Excellent, succulent simmered meats, flavorful tofu soup, fresh vegetables
The wait staff was pretty good
The atmosphere was relaxed and modern
Excellent food, pleasant ambience, top notch service in the hip Hells Kitchen neighborhood
Ideal for just before or after a show or for cocktails at the lounge
The plates were a bit wierd (flat tiles essentially) and the portions were small, but otherwise excellent restaurant
Would highly recommend
great food, atmosphere, service
food was better than most traditional korean restaurants
staff were very cooperative with the birthday celebration recently held there
I live an work in the Midtown area and was suprised to find an upscale Korean restaurant so close by
I went in for lunch, which is quite affordable, and enjoyed it greatly
I have since been back for their Lounge Hour specials
Bann is a great restaurant to just come in and relax
I work in the neighborhood and come at least once a week for their loung hour
The bartenders are friendly and the appetizers are great
I have always been a fan of their SoHo location but I love this restaurant
It's more upscale and the food is extremely creative and the service is great
I came here with a bunch of friends and we had a great time
The lounge is pretty cool for drinks also
the service is terrible
beef came out frozen, no one seemed to care
craving good food, left after beef came out frozen
server said sorry, they called the cook and bartender to the downtown location
ridiculous, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT THIS PLACE
What a wonderful, romantic evening we spent at Bann
i recommend it to anyone looking for a classy evening with a date
as a culinary school grad, who has a very good understanding of food and flavor, the chef at d'or ahn is doing something wonderful and unique
what a talent
I have been really delighted with the food, service and over all experience of Bann
The food is awesome(the desserts are great, too), and the staff are extremely nice
Atmosphere takes your breath away
In this very chic, hip bar/restaurant
the drinks were good,too
I recommend the Bann's Lychee martini

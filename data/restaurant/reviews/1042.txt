A hour passed until the waitress came over to give us menus and tell us she would be right back another hour later After trying to order fish she informed us that all fish entrees on the menu was sold out We took a minute to make a second choice and tried to order something else that we were told was also sold out
Finally, we ordered and received our appetizers another hour 40 minutes later we received our entrees, less one side that arrived after all plates were clearedcharred cauliflower, that had to be sent back
The restaurant took off one salad and one side off of our bill
They also brought us 3 desserts for 4 peoplea nice gesturebut not necessary since none of us were interested in dessert
Have to disagree with some of the reviews here
Was in town last week walking around the neighborhood and came across this place
The writer below is corrrect, when the weather si good and the garage doors are up this is a fantastic atmosphere and the people watching is superb
We didn't have reservations but were seated politely with the understanding we wouldn't linger, which was no problem as the service was prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable
The waitress was able to make good suggestions for wines by the glass, as we were in no shape to finish off a bottle
Had the risotto and the skirt steak, both of which were delicious
A great neighborhood place, great crowd, and friendly service
We had a spectacular night of dinner and dancing at the Oak Room
The food was wonderful, the band was great, and the ambience was amazing
It was like stepping back in time
Everything from the tuxedo-clad servers, to the beautiful linen, to the fresh orchids on each table was perfect
We highly recommend the Oak Room
Excellent Restaurant and Supper Club (not a Social Club)
I was also there on Valentines Day
They had some Computer problems, too many reservations and few servers
But the ambiance was unique and the food is excellent
In spite of the problems we had lots of fun
Upon inquiring I was explained the place had just opened for about 4 weeks
Since then we went once again for dinner and we had a great time, good food, attentive service a spectacular environment and great music; and I am very glad about it
I dont believe its fair for any person to totally condemn a new business without taking in consideration all the circumstances
It happens for a new start-up to encounter difficulties
We personally recommend the place to everyone as a very special discovery
I ordered 2 rolls to be delivered and when they arrived and as I began to eat I noticed they tasted quite fishy and smelled funny
I thought it might have just been that piece so I had one from the opposite end, and to my shock a staple punctured my gum! Ewwwww! When I called to let them know, the manager was very unapologetic, and would only offer me a refund if I brought him the sushi and showed him the staple! Give me a break! Go to Roponngi! They have the best sushi and it's very fresh!!!!!!!
Affordable edible tolerable yes
I was at a client meeting recommended Raku II as I am a regular at the original Raku times square, thinking their standard of quality would be the same
Not exactly the same selection but unique in their own right
The lobster steak combo was very good, but their sushi rolls were just ok
The unagi pcs came out a bit soggy, the salmon y/tail sushi a little gamey for my taste
The california uni was way too strong (I suspect not fresh)
The emily roll was fairly good but not too thrilled with their other special rolls
Tempura arrived soggy cold
Overall, a decent spot but does not compare w/ Raku midtown
My last negative comment is the delivery time was terrible - ordered at noon for my 12:30 lunch meeting they told me 30min
- it didn't arrive till 1:20pm
Calling them to complain they offered no apology except that the delivery fellow got lost (who doesn't speak english very well), needless to say a $12 tip turned into $2 - as I was embarrassed by the lateness the avg
quality
Lesson learned
I've never been to a Japanese restaurant before, and this place is a favorite of my friend
Walked up to it, and from my first impression I never would have believed I would receive such a great meal
I'm unfamiliar with seafood, sushi, etc
But everything I ordered tasted wonderful
The staff was very courteous and helpful, the dining experience was nice and cozy
I didn't feel afraid to ask questions
I will definitely go back! Everyone is hospitable, you wouldn't think you were in the middle of New York City
Good luck trying to park a car though if you had to
I'm a huge sushi and sashimi connoisseur, and have eaten and loved the fish at Nobu's, Jewel Bako, Jewel Bako Makimono, Blue Ribbon, Yama's, Haru's, etc
, etc
, etc
, but this place edges out the pricier and trendier places because it focuses on the fish
The atmosphere is lacking, the music stinks, and the neighborhood is sedate, but the fish is the freshest that you will find east of the west coast, hawaii and asia
The only place that compared in terms of value and consistency was Iso's which unfortunatley closed
Always fresh, always mouth-wateringly delicious -- I cannot say enough good things about the food
My absolutely favorite sushi restaurant for miles around
If I had one suggestion it's that they could choose music which goes better with the food and the ambience
So, I often get delivery
which is always prompt and courteous
This is a favorite of many local residents
I just happen to be in the neighorhood w/ friends who love it here (espec
their private tatami room which is now gone reasonable prices)
Chefs are friendly - food selection quality is just ok
Was told they had the same suppliers - but if I had my druthers I would go out of my way back to the original Raku on 47th st
as their owner staff are quite friendly service oriented (except during their lunch pre-theater rush hours), their quality/variety cozy at home like friends ambiance is far better of the Raku's
For a small spot, svc could have been more attentive
The Emily roll was ok but the best deal is their surf turf
SUM IT: try it once but do try Raku times sq
by far better in all aspects

0? This place barely deserves a 5
0!! The fish is decent, nothing spectacular, ambiance is your typical japanese decor, I was so disappointed at this place
Please bypass this place for some restaurant worth your time
We went to this restaurant after the theatre
The wait staff was wonderfully helpful to one of our party who was unfamiliar with sushi and Japanese food
The food was GREAT! Sushi was fresh, ample portions and very flavorful
The owner, Ray, was most hospitable
The the fruiters and the milky ?
Quite good and great following a great meal
Ray---when in Tucson, stop by!   The Chief
A little trip to Japan
simple decor with wooden ornaments, fresh fresh sushi with subtly different flavors in every roll and piece, presented with attention to detail and design reflecting the tradition of Japan
We have been to sushi throughout the city and upper west side, and this was truely one of the most fresh and delicious
You walk into what looks like a regular neighborhood sushi place and walk out with a lot of respect
It was quiet and easy, good for during the week or the weekend
Comfortable environment, friendly service, good sushi and food with good price
Fancy names for the sushi rolls do not make up for the average quality of food served there
There is nothing special about this place and I certainly won't rate it as one of the best in the city
This place is ok if you live in the area and just want to have some raw fish
Seriously, this is one of the very best in New York
The sushi is among the freshest I've had recently
The chef's rolls are incredibly inventive and taste like no sushi you've ever had (try the Emily Roll)
And the value cannot be beat -- two huge pieces of shashimi for less than most lesser restaurants
Outstanding!
A true gem for upper west side sushi lovers
Melt in your mouth pieces of fish as well as a unique selection of specialty rolls to quench your appetite
The quality of food produced from this small newcomer certainly ranks among the best New York sushi, including places at which I have eaten recently such as Bond Street, Hasaki and Tomoe
Furthermore, the people who run this place are a delight

When Dufresne serves foie gras topped with anchovy and dotted with tiny bits of crunchy chocolate, it's an education in breaking food down to its essential flavors to see how the building blocks--fat, salt, savory, clean citrus, edgy vinegar, etc
--work together
Much of the cooking challenges diners to break with their food-pairing constructs: Yes, daurade paired with a barbecue-like sauce can work
Fine ingredients elevate all dishes, but particularly the lamb loin, which is among the city's best
Desserts are stellar, especially the parsnip cake with dreamy coconut-cream cheese sorbet
If you like weird tasting food, then this is the place for you
I know that is what they are aiming for, but my palate was assaulted quite a few times
Service was above average, though 3 glasses were broken in the restaurant in the time I was there
I can't even remember the decor
Anyways, I heard this is one of the best restaurants in NY and I was not mesmerized, to say the least
My husband and I went to WD-50 last night with another couple and we all agreed that it was just awful
The food was truly disgusting; I've never had such awful tasting food at any New York restaurant
I didn't know food could be so pretentious
It is clear that wierdness rather than taste is the goal of this place
The service is absolutely unremarkable and the decor is average
It was truly painful to pay an almost $400 check for such awful food and unpleasant experience
This is the worst value I have ever encountered in NYC
In a city like NY, it is an absolute waste to throw money at this place
The place: Nice, modern, totally unpretentious
The service: competent, nice and unintrusive
What makes wd-50 unique is the food
Just looking at the menu will make you really think about what you're about to eat
Squid noodles? Mole paper? Manchego cheesecake? Ancho Caramel? However, this is not a kid running wild with a chemistry set, as the food is expertly prepared and very nicely presented
And not only that, you're having an absolutely new experience in tastes and textures
There is no restaurant in NY where food is as interesting as here
Is it memorable? I guess that you could it 'better' in other places, but nowhere will you be as pleasantly surprised as at wd-50
A note on the portion sizes: If you are expecting an 'olive garden-TGIF-Applebee's' size plate, forget it
You will go hungry,and with no doggie bag
This doesn't mean that portions are not adequate for a regular human being
My pork belly entree had three nicely sized pieces of meat, plus a good serving of sauerkraut spatzle and romaine lettuce
You will be satisfied, not stuffed!
I don't have that much to say about this place
The decor was nice, the wait-staff was relatively unremarkable (not good, not bad)
The only part that I really remember was that the portions were extremely small
The appetizer was roughly a fork-full in size
While the food seemed tasty, there wasn't really enough of it to totally confirm this suspicion
There are better restaurants of comparable quality in this city
Precious, overpriced, tiny portions, expensive wines
There were four of us and we sampled each other's dishes (though there was previous little to share) and ultimately agreed we didn't like the place
From the moment we said we didn't want bottled water, we were looked upon with disdain, moving to trying to find an affordable wine, then trying to figure out which things to get as each item had an assemblage of flavors
It was a lot of effort on the part of the chef, but not to fill us up
Desserts were really mediocre at $11 each
The chicken was four clumps of chicken rolled up
Foie gras with watermelon was tasty and lucious but much too tiny a portion
Bathrooms are lovely
We could talk, but what we wanted to say was, This was a mistake
The restaurant was highly overrated
The menu is expensive
The portion is small
The food has no taste
Paying that high price, I could have dined at other places with better food and service
Clear you mind and be prepared to experience something great
The foie gras with the pool of beet juice and olives was fantastic
Go and get the tasting and let the chef show you something great
If you've been to minibar in DC, the amount of food is never a discussion, shouldn't be here either
Kudos to Wylie
I was disappointed, esp
for the price
My turbot was perfectly cooked -- but the pairings of ingredients were just off
The smoked bulghur was sticky and tasted like musty woodchips, the salsify was lovely on its own but overpowered the fish, and the coffee-saffron foam was terrible - there wasn't a flavour to hang onto (and the foam doesn't feel good on the tongue, either)
I wound up eating the delightful turbot by itself
Come to think of it, the obsession with foamed/pureed food-mixes at WD-50 was a little weird (they had foamed pineapple on the dessert menu, and a really awful-tasting eggplant-raisin puree with the skate)
Some of the preparations wound up giving a plastic-y flavour to the entire plate
I had a lovely dessert - French Toast -- but nothing overly challenging (it's hard to mess up the traditional cinnamon-vanilla pairing)
The drinks were good, too
A MAJOR disappointment
Why the hype? I dont mind trying innovative and creative food, however, it should be worth the experience
I recently went with a group of open minded foodie friends to WD 50
We tried the tasting menu with the wine pairing
The decision was unanimous
Not one of us were impressed by any part of the tasting menu
The food was gimmicky - a pseudo freid egg that tasted like plastic
A bottle of miso liquid that turns into a noodle when poured in hot water (also tasted like plastic)
The wines unmemorable
In fact, the restaurant ran out of wine on the tasting menu and poured us the remaining sediment from other open bottles
For the price WD 50 charges for the tasting menu and wine pairing, I felt cheated and robbed!!! In fact, this one of the WORST meals I have ever had
I made a reservation a month in advance and still had to wait over 45 minutes to be seated
We were comped 1 round of drinks but that did not make up for the overpriced, incredibly small plates and poorly tasting food
We tried practically everything on the menu and not one of us were satisfied
Everthing was completely forgettable
The service and explanation of the menu was fine but I felt robbed by the whole experience at the end of the night
I will never eat there again nor will I receommend
This restaurant gets a lot of PR and I truly felt that the Emperor was wearing no clothes
We had the 9 courses tasting menu so we can see all WD-50 has to offer
We found the cooking techniques to be innovative and fun, such as the squeezable noodle with miso soup and the foie gras tourchon that bled when you cut into it
However, the food truly lacked in flavor and the extra ingredient to make it memorable! Example being the sunny side up egg made of carrot and coconut
The dish was too sweet as an appetizer and the flavors did not complement each other well
The same 2 ingredients were served as dessert again
Overall, the restaurant focused too much on innovation rather than taste
The tasting menu portion is small
After 9 courses, we were still hungry so decided on a 10th course - pizza around the corner
The service was ok, but lacked warmth and is below-average for a fine dining restaurant
The food here was absolutely terrible
My friend and I had gone with the express purpose of eating a few things and then lavishing in dessert but the food was so bad that we found ourselves wanting to ask for our money back
The foie gras dish is quite simply, disgusting
And the scallops are overdone
I've eaten at many an eclectic combinationed restaurant and this fell into the over-intellectualized and under-tasty category
I would never go back
Check out Spice Market or Aquavit for similarly priced, better food
If you have read that this restaurant is fabulous, and then you go expecting good food, good ambience and good service, you will just find this last one

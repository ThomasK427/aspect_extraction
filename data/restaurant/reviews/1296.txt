Never again
The food was lousy, bland fish, fatty meat, stale bread with uninteresting cheese hors doeuvres; the service was terrible, rude waiting, unattentive service, (hello, maybe I'd like more wine and water) and how about looking at us when we order instead of your reflection in the mirror
I know you think you're attractive, but I am paying for my vanity, not yours
Well, at least the desert was good
I guess that was worth being gassy all night
Nuf said, Never again
OULALALALA!!! They changed their menu and I have to say it is delicious!!! We started with the mini clams, the goat cheese salad (a must) and the duck rilette panini
Then, we ordered main courses
What is interesting is that you can have them as a french tapas size or as a full entree, it gave us the opportunity to try LOTS of different food (chicken ravioli, rack of lamb, striped bass and NY steak)
We just had a great time, great service, great wine, and magnifique food
Don't forget their cocktails!!! I think the bartender name is David, ask him for his special cocktails, that night, I had the lichee cosmo, so good!!!!!
Have been a regular at Paradou for a while and decided to check out this place
Pleasantly surprised
Menu is totally different from Paradou
Theyre doing a French small plates thing
Some really really cool things
Had the Salt Cod Fritters and Scallops to start followed by the Bass with Artichoke Ravioli and Rack of Lamb
Everything was really tasty and looked great
Portions were not too small, but would recommend 5 plates between 2 people
The prtions are bigger than tapas size but you need more for it to be a full entree
The wine list is pretty good
Very reasonably priced
The cocktail list is where its happening
Definitely the best Litchi Martini Ive had
Some great dessert cocktails also
Have the White Chocolate Martini or the Winter in Paris
Both were really tasty and a great way to finish a very enjoyable dinner
I had dinner this past Tuesday with four friends at Partage
To our surprise, they had completely changed the menu and the new menu was delicious
I already loved the food at Partage but, a new chef has created an even more delicious variety of tastes
Some of the best additions are the Seared Diver Scallops and Foie Gras, as well as, the Striped Bass and Rack of Lamb
Also, Partage is now doing portions in two sizes shared or individuals, which was perfect because there were too many things we wanted to try
Aside from the great food, there was a wine tasting that night which paired the perfect reds and whites with the food - a nice bonus! To top it off, the ambiance was great - candle lit tables, lovely crowd, good music, lovely service
What more could we ask! HIGHLY RECOMMEND, WE LOVED IT!
I went to this place on one of my best friends' birthday, and the whole occasion was ruined by this unprofessional, nasty tasting, most importantly poor service so called French restaurant! The waiter spilt full glass of water onto two of my friends throughout the dinner WITHOUT apologizing nor feeling sorry
We brought along our cake for her birthday and when he took it out, he gave us spoons only
After candles were blown, we had to ask for the knife to cut the cake as if we don't ask, I assume he thinks we could just scoop into the cake without cutting it
The worst part is that we have 7 people in our group and 20% of gratuity was included in the bill
I felt so bad that I've recommended to my friends about this place where I've ruined her birthday
I would never trust the reviews again!!
the salads here are all amazing
i had steak with a pepper sauce that i thought was good, and one of my friends had lamb that was even better
pass on the desserts, i think they could use some work, but overall very nice casual french place
we took our time and our server was very attentive
I'd completely written off this stretch of 7th Ave, as being populated by mediocre diners, Sushi Samba, and other places serving bad food
I was very skeptical when my friends told me we were going out in this 'hood
Well, it nice to be proven wrong, in fact very wrong
Partage is a tremendous find in any neighborhood
Really great food
Cant caomplain about anything I had
The mussels were the best I remember having in NY
The steak charred and juicy with a tremendous roquefort sauce, the seafood pasta with juliened vegetables wich they cleverly call pasta was amazing
The wine list is great and reasonably priced, andthe cocktail list is very creative and strong
The only thing that was disappointing is that Partage is not near my house
Otherwise Id be there 3 times a week
waaoo
l had dinner at partago again and l don't know how but the food is better than ever
anybody who likes french food, must go to partago
the chef makes amazing food
place is cool, cozy, service is not the best, but the food, place is highly recommended
have been going to paradou for years, so my expectations were high going to partage, and it didn't disappoint
truly wonderful atmosphere, food was so much better than what we expected and the wines very reasonable
i think they will want to grow their wine list, and i think with time the service will improve
but the visuals, the sounds, and the atmosphere with the great food make up for any sins
How lucky were my friends and I to find this cool new restaurant! As a person that normally complains about something, I must say Partage had me at hello
Upon walking in the door, I was immediately warmed by the surrounding
Cool atmosphere, candle lit ambience, great music and damn good food
The exact type of place I can go over and over
For something this good Id expect to pay more
I've been going to their other restaurant Paradou for years and was thrilled when I heard they were opening another one
The food is fantastic, a great variety of mixed drinks, outdoor seating, and the DJ on the weekends makes going out for dinner so much fun
Absolutely check it out!
The food here makes Taco Bell seem gourmet! It's greasy and tastes disgusting
The drinks are nothing to write home about either
There are a TON of better Mexican options in the city
I've only been to this place once for dinner, and it wasn't all too spectacular
So, I will not be returning again
It was so dark that we couldn't really read the menus
We were holding up the tiny candles to the menus
The food was overpriced and the quality of the food was just average
The service was average: he was really nice but he HARDLY came around to see if we needed anything
A couple times we had to ask another server for more water
Not to mention, the drinks were overpriced as well
I don't recommend this place for dining
For a night of drinking at the bar, then that's a different story
I think the last guy that wrote his review must have been on something
my freinds and I, LOVE SWANKY's, not only is it an istitution
but one in the Ivy caliber of institutions , its always a great time
from the margaritas to the music
the guy said the food was okay
he obvoiusly didnt have the steak fajitas
they are amazing
and I have never had a bad margarita at Swanky's
they have so many deeeelicious flavs
but after 3 or four
who cares
lol
lol
and its a neighborhood place,,,with great bartenders
he is nuts

This was the best meal I ever had! We ordered the Okase, in which the chef sends out whatever he feels like, prixe fixe at $80
The food melted in our mouth -- still can't get over the almond cake with sour cherry sauce
They don't pick up the phone for reservations, so keep trying -- I got through eventually
Also, I was overdressed -- more casual than expected
Not very romantic -- more of a place to see and be seen
Lots of celebrities
The food: excellent! The service: Truly bad
Orders forgotten, rushed, poor explanations
The room: pretty, but what is that smell at the entry
I think they need a new air filtration system
The bathrooms: Low, very low
While much of the food is excellent, as is the service once at a table, the front door alone is enough to scare everyone away
Showed up early without a reservation
Yes, a table is available, can you be out by 8? Yes, no problem
I need the table at 8
No problem
You will need to vacate table by 8
Yes, not a probelm, my hearing is not impaired
As we were taken to table crazy hostess repeated same mantra twice and said we may ask you to leave if not done at 8
Me: don't bother, I am out of here
You shouldn't even treat a tourist like this, let alone a NYer
Went to Nobunextdoor and had a good meal
Front door needs serious attention
You are all chumps! This place sucks! Bad food, poor atmosphere, funky smell, stinking bathroom
We waited FOREVER, our edamamae was dried out, they took it back nicely, but over charged us by $50 on our bill
That was rectified too but we really didn't care
The whole experience was annoying, the food pretty poor and 2 hours later I still smell like the place
Hork! There are many places in the city that provide better sushi and atmosphere for the same price without the wait
Maybe at one time Nobu was great, I'm sorry I missed it cause I'll never be back
Nobu, I'm sorry to trash your restraunt but it really is sub-par
Matsuhisa in Aspen is excellent and I will be back there but not here
My gf took me there for my Bday dinner
I enjoyed it immensely
Maitre'D wasnt snobbish as most poster mentioned
Service was pretty good as oppose to what other reviewers said
Food was excellent
Thought I was gonna see Iron Chef in action, but didnt happen
One advice, stay with the kitchen food
Sushi/sashimi is nothing special
The cold and hot dish menu items were great culinary creations
This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to
The service is impeccable as well as the food
Very creative, the place is OK, the food good
Very expensive
Every review has people talking about the snotty matre-de
You people are crazy
This is the best (and most expensive) restaurant in the WORLD
If you can spring for the 120 a plate sampler it is worth it
There is nothing out there like this place
LOVE it LOVE it LOVE it
The server could call me names all night long and this would still be te best
This is truly a culinary delight! The flavors of the dishes are so incredible
The signature dishes are the way to go if you have never dined here, but the sushi is equally delicious
The squid pasta, the black miso cod, the tuna tartar and the rock shrimp tempura are to die for
The decor is great and the service too
I also liked the list of specialty drinks and found the drinks to be mixed to perfection
All around this is a fabulous dining experience as one should expect from Nobu
Considering the wait and snobbiness of the maitre 'd I had to put up with, Nobu is not worth it
I am not going to totally diss its food because it's good, just not excellent
The problem with Nobu is that the food there is simply not genuine
Its so-called famous black cod and Kobe beef are merely fish and beef drowned in soy-sauce
Nothing like what I have eaten in Japan
For good sushi, go to Yasuda
For good Kobe beef, go to Japan
There are many more Japanese restaurants in town that serve better food with a friendlier smile
Great food
Recommend going with only one person because if you go with a group, you will not walk out feeling full and satisfied (however, you will probably walk out very drunk
)
The food is excellent and the black cod is too die for, so good that you don't want to share any of it with a table of more than 5! You need to go with one person to really enjoy the Nobu experience!
Food was very expensive and tasted like second-rate chinese takeout
Famed cod dish tasted like it had soy sauce and corn syrup
Sushi rolls fell apart
Very short list of sakes
Kobe beef tasted like steak-umms with scallion
A few gems, but mostly disappointing
Although Nobu has great Japanese cuisine, their actual sushi is overpriced nothing special at all
For great sushi go to Tomoe or Sushi Samba!
Nobu keeps getting better with every visit
Cutting edge cuisine, attentive professional service, and a room brimming with excitement
Anything that you have to wait for that long and pay high price for is not all that
For less money and no wait, there are tons of other places in the city
I almost want to say even GO SUSHI is better
If you want to see real sushi masters at work, sit at the bar stools near the chefs
Good food and service
Nobu had the best Japanese cuisine I have eaten in NYC
The sushi amp; sashimi was fresh and melted in your mouth
The restaurant was lovely and the service very good
I have recommended Nobu to my friends and would go back again and again
why is this on everyone's list of favorite japanese and sushi
most of the cooked food is great, sushi is good but if you want sushi, go somewhere that specializes in sushi like Yasuda or Kuruma
Good Service
I didn't order correctly and therefore was mildly disappointed with the food
Better sushi can be had elsewhere for less money
Service was spotty
We were asked 3 times for drinks before we got our water
Nobu is without a doubt in NYC's Top Ten best of it's type
Easily!  1
Blue Ribbon Sushi 2
Sugiyama 3
Tomoe 4

The shrimp were flash fried in their shell and wonderfully seasoned! The fries were very thin and crisp and were a big hit for a couple that are not big french fry fans! All in all a nice dining expereince and will visit again on our next trip to NYC
Having heard great things about this restaurant - charming, cozy,friendly, fabulous seafood, imagine our surprise when we were unceremoniously asked to hurry up, because people are waiting for a table!! With a limited menu of about twelve items, it would seem to me that even the seriously detached waitstaff could pull off some courteous service at 6:00PM (opening time) on a summer Monday night! The food was adequate at best, the owner tense and grim, and the staff borderline surly
Apparently the host doubles as bouncer, since it was his job to ask us to leave during our dessert
With all of the fabulous restaurants in New York, it is absolute arrogance to treat a three person, (three hundred dollar) tab so shabbily! I'll take a street vendor before I visit Pearl again
PS
The only people waiting were seated at the bar - not throngs clogging the sidewalk
We had heard that this place was great, but after reading some of the reviews here, we went expecting the worst
It is small and busy, but we found the service to be excellent
The maitre d accurately told us how long the wait would be, told us to come back at a particular time, and we went down the street for a drink while we waited
When we returned we were seated immediately
I don't know what else you could ask for
And the food is delicious
For what it is, it is just perfect
What a disappointment!! It's called OYSTER BAR, and yet no oyster selection at all! You order 6 or 12
Which other oyster bar does this? That's like going to a wine bar, and all you can get is a house red
Rushed, uncomfy
Yes, they absolutely not let you take your time to eat
The waiter actually won't let us order appertizer first (all food requests must stay within one order)
Also can't change our mind 5 min after we order (food is already on its way, people're waiting)
Are we at McDonald?  Food is decent, but then so are all the restaurants on this street
Not cheap, very limited selection
Long wait
Cramped, loud, hectic
I'm not going back
It's not worth dealing with them
Go to the little French restaurant next door, and you'll have much better seafood
Pearl Oyster Bar should really thank their PR person
Food is greaaat! The place is too tight
servers constantly bump into you and often you have to move around so that they can get by
Server are somewhat indifferent without smiling, possibly too busy and overworked
If you can overlook all that (I do), then definitely give it a try
i believe this place was better when it was a quaint little shack with the freshest lobster and best tasting lobster roll in all of manhattan
i think it's lost some of that charm and mystique with the expansion
they definitely rush you out as well
Having dined at Pearl numerous times over the past few years, most recently January 2005, I can honestly say this restaurant has declined in service and quality of food
The service was always hurried and a bit rude, but the food was fantastic, so we were always able to overlook that
Being from Massachusetts, it was the only place in NYC to get that lobster shack style food
Much, much better food and service before the expansion of the restaurant
Disappointing menu selection
Small serving portions
Pricey
The seating is very cramped b/c it's not called a bar for nothing
Unless you're in a 2+ group you'll likely end up eating on the bar
I've been to Pearl's several times, and always had outstanding food, good service, and a terrific time
They have the best steamers in town, fresh oysters, and delicious lobster rolls
I've seen comments about rude service but never experienced it myself
If you're in the mood for Massachusetts-style seafood, the fried oysters, oysters on the half shell, clams, lobster rolls, fish specials and ice cream sundaes hit the spot every time
Take a tip from the Mermaid Inn
there is a way to run a busy, popular seafood restaurant where you are able to turn tables without making your guests (the people who pay your pricey rent) feel like dirt
When the chef heard why we were leaving (angry, aggressive server, indifferent attitude), she shrugged her shoulders and said I don't care
Enough said
After having dinner on Tuesday night, we asked for 2 more drinks
instead of dessert
Suddenly the manager, came to our table yelling absolutely no way we can have a drink after dinner becuase he has tables waiting Just to be clear we spent over $70 and had 1 drink each, we used the table for about 1hour and 15 minutes
I HAVE NEVER NEVER BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE SO A RESTUARANT CAN TURN TABLES
THESE RUDE PROFIT OBSESSED POEPLE WILL LOOSE THEIR BUSINESS CLIENT BY CLIENT
I WILL NEVER BE BACK, AND WILL GO OUT OF MY WAY TO BE SURE ANYONE I KNOW WILL NEVER GO THERE
IT WAS AWFUL AND THE FOOD WASN'T EVEN WORTH IT!
Despite some negative reviews on citysearch I said to myself, Probably just a fluke, I heard they are excellent
So my girlfriend and I went early (6-ish) to beat the crowd on a Friday night
We were greeted by a super RUDE bartendress/waitress who told us to Just go next door, there's a table in there! Once we sat down, the same rude waitress came by, spoke at us like an auctioneer at an auction block, her words tumbling out so quickly I had no idea what she said
At the end of our meal, she came up to us as we were taking our last sips of beer and said Could you finish your beers by the window? I need your table for a four-top! RUDE RUDE RUDE
NEVER WILL I GO AGAIN
Plus, THE FOOD AIN'T ALL THAT!
A couple of friends and I went to Pearl's to sample their lobster-rolls last night
After 3 or 4 walk-bys, the hostess finally acknowledged my presence and informed me that there was a 25-minute wait
So, we decided to get a few drinks at the bar while waiting
After 5-minutes of trying to get the bartender's attention, she said in her most patronizing tone, Sir, I will get to you when I've finished serving those customers who have already ordered
Fine
As I waited, a group-of-four walked in who wanted to eat at the bar
The hostess came up behind me and said, Excuse-me, sir, these people would like to sit down and eat
Unbelievable! We walked right-out
Luckily, the night was rescued by the small fish restaurant at the T-section of Bleecker and Cornelia
Plus, the prices were A LOT less and the food and service were great
There are few tables; most likely, you'll be seated at the bar or on a stool facing the wall
The service is bad; the staff is hurried and rude
They should hire more staff or seat fewer people instead of making the experience a burden
Lobster roll is really good, but *anybody* can make a really good lobster roll -- it's chopped boiled lobster, mayonaisse, and celery, for God's sake
I also tasted a good sea bass and had a bowl of a good-tasting clam chowder (disappointingly there weren't any actual clam pieces in it, though)
The prices are high considering the low overhead and small staff, and the dining experience is below average even if you are lucky enough to be seated at a table
If price is no object you'll get a very good lobster roll
But the price you pay will not only be in dollars
Went there at 6:30p on a Sat with 2 friends to find all tables full with 1 party of 4 waiting
Was told by the hostess, who greeted us with contempt, that we couldn't get a table until 8p
It seemed strange considering there weren't many people waiting
We heard the food was good decided to stay anyway hoping to be seated earlier
We asked the bartender for drinks, who told us to go through the hostess
When we asked her, she suggested we simply LEAVE and return at 8p, saying we'd get tired standing! Considering we were three polite women who just wanted to eat, we were stunned to essentially be told we weren't welcome by a rude and condescending hostess
Since they didn't need our business, we went next door the charming Le Gigot- amazing food and lovely service-highly recommended!!
I arrived for dinner at 6:30pm on a Saturday and was seated immediately at the bar
We ordered the (6) Little neck clams ($7
50) and the Crabcake ($12
50) for starters and we both had the famous Lobster Roll ($20) for our main course
Everything was tasty and I'm willing to wager that there was more than one lobster worth of meat in my lobster roll
Staff was friendly and helpful with suggestions
I ususally am a big fan of the hugely popular, highly recommended neighborhood restaurant
I was shocked at how disappointing my latest experience here was since reviews are so uniformly great
Then again maybe they've grown beyond their ability to maintain the high quality
At 7pm on a recent Friday evening the place was crowded but not prohibitively
We sat at the bar and were constantly bumped by the waitress flying past; had fabulously fresh raw oysters with pieces of shell in every bite; lobsters rolls were tasty but the large pieces of meat were tough; the apple crumble was excellent but the ice cream was over-frozen and the stench of frying oil was nearly unbearable

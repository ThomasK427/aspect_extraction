We stumbled onto Ebisu recently and were more than pleasantly surprised
Beautiful space, very friendly/professional staff, and a very interesting menu
Their sushi was all very good (although the one roll I had was a bit 'loose' and sloppy)
many thumbs up
The food at EBISU is always good!! I've been EBISU so many times, but you definately need a reservation on weekends
You can also have party in the back dining room
Sometimes, the food comes slow, but we understand
You might wanna avoid rush hours
Nice Atmosphere but not as serene or exceptionally beautiful as prior reviews implied
It had that typical clean, blond wood, sushi-ya look
The wait staff service was fine but the timing of the kitchen was unpredictable and slow
As a party of two, one entree came out 20 minutes before the other
One appetizer came quickly, one came about 10 minutes later
It was nice of the waiter to give us free edamame as a consolation/peace offering but the overall experience was frustrating
Moderate selection of sake but for a bottle large enough to share among two, all were $30 except one
My overall - good enough to eat at should you be in the neighborhood but chances are you probably have one of similar or better quality right in your own backyard
Ebisu is wonderful
We've been many times and every time the staff is so nice and the food is just delicious
The sushi is top quality, the cooked dishes are delicious and the sake is tasty! I recommend Ebisu to people who want a quiet delicious meal
Serene atmosphere, excellent service, amazing food, and an unusual menu make this one of the best reasonably-priced Japanese restaurants in town
The specials are extremely creative and the presentation is beautiful
And there is no better sign of a fine Japanese restaurant than the fact that most of the clientele are Japanese
Japanese restaurants are all over the city, but there are only a few that I would rate as truly Japanese in their quality, originality, presentation, and diversity of dishes
Ebisu is just such a gem
From their diversity of authentic Japanese dishes, to the impeccable service, to the creativity and the skill of the chefs (the knife work is amazing), Ebisu is a high high quality restaurant, but at very reasonable prices
The freshness of the ingredients and the taste is enough reason alone to go back again and again, but their attention to detail makes every meal memorable
An especially good value is their $15 sunset menu, betweeen 5 and 7pm weekdays
You will not be disappointed
I went to Ebisu with no prior knowledge of the restaurant, but I was very suprised with the quality and value and creativity of the food
The environment is pleasant and soothing in a clean japanese style, and the service was very good
I have gone back several times already and they always have great specials and appetizers
the sushi is awesome, too
Highly recommended, and not crowded
(yet)
El Nidos one of the best restaurants in New York which I've ever been to, has a great variety of tasty, mouth watering pizza's
The pizza's are made fresh, crispy, and ready to serve
Their made with no eggs so it is also good for veggies
The Food is great, No Lard, msg or any animal fat used
Great Vegetarian Menu Service with a smile Try The Pizza also made with semolina crust
I take it this is a listing for Emilou's Cafe
I hear this is owned by the same people who own Jesse's across the street
We like both places but now that Emilou's has re-opened following renovations, we lean more towards Emilou's - it's less expensive, a bit more casual, and we don't have to walk all the way up the hill to get to it, LOL! Seriously, though, love the variety here - everything from smoothies to hummus, to sandwiches and full entrees, plus beer and wine, can be had here
There's not a lot of places in the area that offer that kind of variety(except, uh, Jesse's)
Food is delicious - better than Jesse's and also a better value - and service is friendly
The thing that would make this place absolutely perfect is outdoor seating, maybe in the back?? Maybe that's wishful thinking on my part, but one can always hope
So--I've been here many times but Brunch today was a new experience
I ordered aa drink with my brunch, and it arrived with a fly in it
I've worked as a bartender and I know that happens when you don't make fresh mixes in the moring
No biggee
just make a fresh one
My eggs arrived and there was an ant crawling in the garnish
I sent it back
Never saw the waitress again until I asked for the check
When it arrived, she said they didn't charge for my meal, but it was probably because I was eating outside
I said (calmly) that I didn't want to hear who it was my fault, but their explanation wasn't the point
The manager decided to come over at that point and tell me that in the future I should eat inside
Not what a regular customer want to hear
When I said I probably wouldn't be back, his response was, Good as he stalked off
Used to like the place as a family friendly eatery, not anymore
I've been to Fetch several times and so far haven't been disappointed
The atmosphere is great, especially if you're an animal lover, and the menu selection is well suited to the decor
There's also an interesting beer selection if you're looking to try something a little different
If you have a dog you'll probably love this place and may end up getting you dog's picture on the wall as several other patrons have done
How adorable!
I just moved to the neighborhood and have been trying all of the resteraunts around me
Fetch looked cute and always has a brunch crowd
I went for dinner and thought the atmosphere was really nice and fun
The service and thr food was terrible though
I ordered a dirty martini that was not dirty at all-and when I asked the waitress to make it dirtier, instead of reshaking/making it at the bar, she broght me over some olive juice in a cup!? Maybe I should have stuck with beer
My food was very bland and overpriced for what it was
It's like they wanted to be a step above a sportsbar but increased the prices without increasing the menu quality
We asked for the check and had to wait 20mins for the waitress to come back and take our card
I won't be back
The restaurant was cozy and a dog lovers paradise
The service we experienced was friendly and good
Don't know about the more expensive items on the menu but that's not what we went there for
I can say that the wraps, burgers and salads were all fresh, tasty and the mango margareta at $9 was WELL WORTH the money
It was delicious and large!  If you bring a framed photo of your dog/s they will even hang the photo on their wall
In an area where quality Hamburgers are abundant, Fetch offers the standby burger plus extra comfort food
I think the real deal here however is now is the recent attention to their Beer
I stopped eating and drinking here years ago because I found the beer to be flat, and nothing was ever done about it
On my last two trips, I was surprised and delighted as to how fresh and cold the beer was
AND they even have the Proper Beer GLASS for each BEER ! well done
Although the decor is appealing and homey, the food is horrible! My appetizer and entree were flavorless and lukewarm
I ate about 1/8 of my entree and when my waitess came over, she didn't even ask if there was something wrong or if she could take it off the bill for me
She was rude and just didn't care
I am not that hard to please at a restaurant, but Fetch is just really bad
My fiance and my best friend both live on the Upper East Side, and practically every time I am in their neighborhood (which is close to always), we are at FETCH
Whether it is a weekend brunch, dinner, or just hanging at the bar for cocktails, we always have THE BEST TIME
It is such an up and friendly atmosphere, with the best staff ever! And when my fiance and I just want to have a nice, romantic date
still our favorite place! We get one of their great window or cozy corner tables
awesome
Last but far from least
THE FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
the menu offers something for everyone, (even vegetarian, fish eater,etc)But whatever you're craving, they've got it
Wow, I just reread this
Can you tell I LOVE THIS PLACE???!!!!
This is by far the best restaurant on the upper east side
What they do to save the homeless and/or shelter dogs is amazing
I love the food

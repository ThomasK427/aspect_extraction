i was highly disapointed
way too loud and cramped
so-so food
our lobster was over-cooked and the grilled chicken salad was really bad
we did like the grilled shrimp and the tartare with the green tobiko but the entrees were boring
bland cocktails
average service
not worth the trip to the upper east side
didn't like the asian-kitsch either
too predictable and stereotypical
really bad, loud music
won't be back
The food was great but not enough to buffer the trashy crowd! I was hesitant to go here after I heard the same guys that own the Serafina Pizza chain (need I say more
) own this but said ok when I heard Le Bernardin helped with the menu
What a motley match-up!!! I will always go back to Le Bernardin but never again to Geisha
It's just a Japanese-Serafina dressed up a little bit with much better food but still eurotrashy way too loud clublike for a serious restaurant
No thanks! I'm sticking with Nobu
Ate here on a busy tuesday
Food was great and the sashimi selections were impressive
The only dish we didn't like was the chicken salad
Service was a little rocky but I understand becasue they just opened
We had a great sake tasting with 3 different high grade sakes and some decent cocktails
It was really hard to get past the bar area though which was packed and we had to wait 45 minutes to get a table because they don't take reservations
What is that? And the hostess was REALLY RUDE and clueless too
Next time I'm going to Matsuri for better atmosphere without the attitude
Been waiting for Geisha to open for awhile
I'm a fan of Eric Ripert's live nearby
The food was excellent but service left something to be desired
Night was good until a man who I later came to find out is the owner, was pushing himself onto the diners being intrusive annoying
He approached our table while we were browsing menu started suggesting items
I could tell he knew nothing about cuisine
It was really embarrassing I smiled blankly just wanting him to leave
I get that it's his restaurant but please sir leave the diners alone!! The other reason I probably won't be back is the scene
The bar was packed with Euro-trashy men over-done, barely dressed women
Not the crowd I'd expect in a place with such a talented chef
It was Au Bar meets 'Absolutely Fabulous' meets a Versace Outlet Sale
ick
The Scene A tiny open kitchen overlooks the small, spare dining room of 30 or so seats
The often-harried staff can strike a dissonant chord with the intended laid-back sake-sipping vibe, but once the parade of food and drink starts arriving, all such concerns are banished
The Food Dishes are small, intense bites composed from a Southeast Asian palette
The flavors tend toward vividness rather than subtlety: A salad trio of pickled vegetables sings with vinegar and salt; sauteed mushrooms are rich and savory
Delicate pork tonkatsu, fried to the point of decadence in butter and served over peppery cress, is fantastic; likewise a creamy-fleshed, gingery bigeye tuna steak and simple, perfect sauteed greens
A choice among more than 20 sakes offers a delightful counterpoint to the savory small plates
Altogether, I just felt that for the price, the quality was absent
The edamame were tough, in a boring sauce
The three different fish dishes we tried were all bland
Nothing was bad -- but absolutely nothing stood out
great small plates(tapas), the Oyster Omlette was very good and the Chinese Sausage was even better, the plates are small but full of taste and bite
the space is very nice and romantic set in a 2nd floor apartment
maybe because i've read so much about it and expectations were too high? maybe
yes its cozy, yes the service is good but the food is just okay (my fish was overcooked and dry)
all in all i found this place a bit overrated
Kuma Inn is one of the few places in New York city that provides all the qualities of a good restaurant: excellent food, superb customer service and great value
The Chef never disappoints with his creative and exquisite tapas
Along with tasty tapas, the extensive sake menu, delicious desserts and well-selected background music make it a great place for one person or large groups
I have gone with groups of ten or more and the restaurant has always maintained the high level of service I have come to expect
For New Yorkers, enjoying a good meal at a reasonable cost is priceless and Kuma Inn fits the bill
I have highly recommended Kuma Inn to friends, co-workers and out of towners, they have always thanked me for the suggestion and most have returned
Kuma Inn is one of my favorites!!
My first experience at this quaint restaurant was great!! I had gone there with my boyfriend and another couple, and it was perfect the lighting gave the place a soft, romantic, but fun atmosphere! The service was impeccable and the staff and chef made you feel welcomed!! The food was absolutely delicious
You have to try the softshell crabs, and the sake sangria!! We all loved it!!
Who would have thought that such a low-key-out-of-the-way nook could be so quaint, hip, stylish and best of all delicious
You get appetizer portions chef-prepared and served like entrees
The TAPAS menu offers a wide range of variety for those who love to eat but don't want to settle on one dish
food sake without commitment
If you are a sampler eater than Kuma Inn is the spot not to be missed
By far the best in Pan Asian Tapas cuisine
Kuma Inn not only boasts a wittingly turn on a phrase name, but the food, ambience and service are top-notch!  I've found it to be a perfect place to enjoy savory Asian-inspired tapas just for two or with a group
Every item on the menu is a favorite, so like me, you just may find yourself coming back again and again for a chance to sample each one of your favorites!
Let me start off by saying the food is tasty
The rest of this review will not be so kind
Kuma Inn is the sort of out-of-the-way hip place you take a date you want to impress with your a) knowledge of out-of-the-way hip places and b) garbage bag full of cash marked 'money to burn'
The waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person, but she forgot to say 'times 2' because you really need 4-6 dishes per person (skinny girls too) to feel satiated
I would not recommend this place to health conscious people or vegetarians as the waitress kept changing her story on whether the vegetarian items contained MSG and/or fish sauce/oil
If you don't mind paying $11 for 2 miniscule pieces of scallop, this place is for you
Remember to bring plenty of cash, they don't take plastic, and well, paper just burns better
Went for dinner and drinks with a group of 5
Walking in, you think, what hole in the wall am I in
you quickly forget that it's not the most beautiful scene - the food and the fabulous selection of sakes - including the flight of sakes - just fantastic
The only thing you have to look out for - the plates are small and so tasty and you're throwing back sakes and before you know it, you've ordered 20-30 little plates and drinks and they add up
But if you have a little extra cash one night, just go for it and splurge
The wait staff and chef are so very kind and friendly and after the first drink, the atmosphere feels so cozy
We would definitely go back!
Ambience was laid back in the this little LES find
I can easily describe this as a quaint Filipino Asian Fusion Restaurant
Two warnings: You have to hike it up one floor and the portions are small
some larger sized portions which are quite yummy are the mussels and east asian omlet
I highly suggest you order a side order of rice (garlic or sticky) to help fill you up
but leave room for the yummy dessert (plaintains or the custard pie)
Staff was friendly and helpful
I tend to love anything with an Asian flair however, I am still very critical since Ive been to mostly every Asian location in the city
This place by far is my favorite location to eat at the moment
The food is excellent, fresh, and very tasty
Some of my favorites are the Chinese Sausage, Big Eye Tuna, Mussels, and London broil
Not to say that no matter what you order you would be disappointed because everything on the menu is great
Yes, the portions are small but thats obvious since they advertise it as a Tapas location
So if you looking for a big brawny meal try someplace else
I on the other hand like the small portions so I can try everything
Also the place is small (which adds to the neighborhood flavor) so make sure you get a reservation in advance
Overall GREAT find!!!

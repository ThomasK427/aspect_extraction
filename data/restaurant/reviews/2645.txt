You will not taste its equal elsewhere so savor every morsel
great cantonese food at prices so low you couldn't match it if you made it yourself
Cute and hidden, this place has a large menu selection of both mexican and spanish dishes that are very good, although slightly salty
The only problem is that they are under-staffed, so the service is friendly, but extremely slow
You will need over one hour for lunch here
This is a wonderful diner for lunches in the Wall Street area
The service is great and very quick and the food is very good
I especially enjoy their burgers
I have had no problem getting in and out during my one-hour lunch break
I highly recommend the Pearl Diner
When I worked in the neighborhood, I would visit this restaurant often for lunch, and think that it is the best of its kind in that part of town
Particular favorite dishes of mine are their Coriander Chicken, Baigan Bharta and Aloo Gobi
In fact, of the twenty or so Indian restaurants I have eaten at in New York, this is the best Aloo Gobi in town, with only one or two other places even coming close
It has a friendly, casual atmosphere
It is not fancy by any means, but I would take that as a good sign
The kinds of places like this where strangers are likely to share a table during the lunch rush always have better food than the Table-cloth places
The deserts are good too
I visited this restaurant and find the quality of food, service and staff is good
I like the spicy Indian food
being a vegetarian i was desparetly searching for a place to have food very often and luckily it was near my office and i found the food to be good
importantly good Vegetarian variety
Thanks to the nice little family maintaining a good show there
They have made it a good place to eat
it's affordable
it's nice
not a very good ambiance though but still a good place
certainly they have tried to make it as Indian as they can but the dull colours on the walls does not suits
Overall recommended for a good Indian Menu
This is the best North Indian / Delhi / Punjabi Restaurant in downtown
They have a special dish everyday
My favorite is Indian Curry on tuesdays - it is almost like homemade - make your mouth water
You'll find dishes here which are often made in home - with authentic spices and prices are perhaps the best - quite affordable
It is a family owned and run business - so service is home
This is a place to have a good meal - not necessarily expect an environment! Super Highly recommend
We eat here often
This is a great easy-going bar with cheap, cold beer
Mostly frequented by NYU students and young professionals who live nearby, but doesn't have the frat feel
The bartenders are great once you get to know them, and the crowd usually picks up as everybody stops in before heading home at 3am
Great place to meet other young people, many working on Wall st for the summer
This is defiantly the worst pub visited in New York! Situated in a back alley near student accommodation its full of very young possibly underage drinkers at night time and it seems like a place where day time alcoholics go to try and escape their job in the financial district! Staff were quite rude and loud and only look after what seemed to be the regulars! The place is very dull, dark and no atmosphere probably due to where its situated! We werent made feel as welcome or at home as we were in other Irish pubs in New York! Very disappointed!!
This place is absolutely awful
It's run by surly people for surly people - I mean these people have to have somewhere to congregate
The waitress was more interested in sending text messages than in delivering the food
The jukebox is one that will download any song, which means you'll end up hearing hip-hop or Madonna in a sports bar
Avoid at all costs, unless you're surly
I love going here because they have a lot of bottled beer sitting in ice 24/7
There is nothing like a bottle of beer on ice
Plenty of TVs make for a good night of watching sports are hanging local
Best thing about this old reliable establishment is the Staff! Paul, Gavin, Lisa and Theresa are the best reason to have a meal, a drink and some of the best service in the city
You can't ask for more
Cheap beer, great crowd, great service
ggod bar
If your spouse, girl, partner etc
is hanging around the seaport shops or you have been buying music or movies at J and Rs, stop at this place
Good service and food and ice cold greenies
The best place for a yummy grilled cheese on a Sunday night when everyplace else is closed
Friendly atmosphere, good food, and cheap! I loved it
I used to visit this place very frequently but in a couple of months I stoped going there because of unfriendly treatment by the manager who has a bitter face and is quite sarcastic
OK it's not bad for what it is
the food is fresh and you can get a meal for a reasonable price
BUT - they charge 7% for delivery
When I spoke to the owner he had many reasons: it costs to have so many delivery boys (like he's paying disability, WC, unemployment, payroll taxes or benefits for these guys), food costs - you have been steadily increasing your prices
I was told to come pick it up
Well this is NY and delivery rules and 7% delivery charge just does not work for me
Oh, my, god
Have only been there once (at the 21/3rd Ave
location) and had the best cheesbuger I have ever had (and I've tried all the rumored 'best burger' places in NYC -- that's right, I'm lookin' at YOU, Corner Bistro!)
It's huge, cooked just right, great bun, simply unbelievable
Fries great too
The best $10
00 you will EVER spend
Can't wait to try their ribs and more homey-items
Too bad the atmosphere is like a Dairy Queen though
Food this great deserves a more comfortable setting
A+ food especially the ribs and garlic potatos
We are usually ordering for a large group (20+) and always comes ontime and piping hot
They have a great selection of burgers including a Veggie Burger that has garnered rave reviews from everyone I know that has ever tried one
I prefer a regular burger or buffalo meat burger (which they also have here) with some bacon and blue cheese on top
Ryan Maguire's doesn't just take a temp on your burger, they actually cook it to your specs
Give this hidden gem a try
This place is amazing
You think it's just some average bar with crappy food, but really they have nothing bad on their menu
It's just extremely well prepared, large portioned and not too pricey american/irish/italian food
I live in the neighborhood and we absolutely need a place like this
Great drinks, Great bartender, Great food - everyone should check it out -
Really, these are the best in the city
Homemade, soft and they go great with a Bass beer
I live around the corner and love these veggie burgers, and I am not even a vegetarian anymore
About $8
Worth it
Extremely good, fresh food
Falafel's are out of the world and so is the hummus
A must try as it so so cheap
It's not so much a restaurant, but a healthy fast food place
They have dozens of shakes that can include everything from creatine to ephedra, if you like
Their bison burger was juicy and delicious
I can't wait to go back and try the ostrich burger
The one complaint I had is that it has all the decor if a McDonald's
It does not pretend to be anything other than a fast food place
Though hidden beneath the corner of Fulton Street, this place is packed during the lunch hours - when I usually go

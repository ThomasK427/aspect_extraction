The place is fantastic very beautiiful the food not very good
I find my very salted and not very tested
The gnocchi are not very fresh
the fenel salad not test
dessert choice very limited  be an italian person that go to eat in this incredible place in new york
I find that ther are less potential place in the city  but with better food
Read allot of pre-opening hype of this Molto venture
It lives up to the hype in my view
Service was impeccable from the gent opening the door, to the captain, waiter, sommelier
Food was stellar
My gorgeous dinner companion opted for the halibut, I the cod
Texture , taste, and plating were very good on both
Wine selection was deep and ran the gamut of pricing for all tastes and wallets
The tres pasta offering was the way to go and the agniolloti and the orecchiette dish were amazing
Be preparred to bring a full wallet, but it is well worth it in the end
Category of nice touch--my date loved the tiny seats that are provided tableside to the ladies dinning with the latest fashion bag
It was a nice touch
An absolutely spectacular experience overall
The food is simple but delicious, the staff is attentive, kind and very helpful, and the prices are unbeatable--two could eat here, with wine and dessert, for well under $100 easily
Go for the outdoor patio if you can get it, or the climate-controlled greenhouse if that's not an option--the bar area tends to be a little loud
This is genuinely a great spot in Bay Ridge and we're very lucky to have them
A little piece of heaven tucked away on 3rd Aveue
This is what Bay Ridge has been missing
The food in Emi is always perfect
Whether you eat dinner or brunch you will not be dissapointed
MY hat off to the chef and his staff!
I went for dinner with my girl and had a great time
The food service and drinks were on the money
These guys do not skimp on drinks or quality of food
Fantastic! I tried the brunch on Sunday
wow! The best mimosa I ever had
Fodd was just as good
The French toast was perfect
The best part about it was enjoying my brunch outside
For a few minutes I escaped from the New Yprk fast life and enjoyed the the beautiful weather
trust me go there
Came here for Mother's Day brunch and was extremely pleased
We sat out back in the garden area - the service was wonderful - our mimosas never went empty - and the food was delicious
This was our first time to Emi and would highly recommend this restaurant for brunch in Bay Ridge!
I am so excited to learn about this new restaurant in the neighborhood
The food was absolutely delicious and the service was friendly and attentive
A dinner for two that included a shared appetizer, two entrees, two glasses of wine and coffee with a shared dessert cost $92
A bit pricey compared to some of it's neighboring restaurants but worth a visit, at least once
ONCE AGAIN EMI'S WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND, WAS THERE FOR THERE NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY, GREAT FUN HAD BY ALL, FOOD WAS UNBELIVABLE, SERIVCE IMPECHABLE ESPECAILLY THE GRILLED OCTUPUS ENTREE OF SURF AND TURF
WE ALL CARRIED IN 2005 WITH GREAT FUN
IT'S A MUST THAT PEOPLE COME AND ENJOY THE GREAT TIMES WITH LOUIE AND PAT
My wife and I have visited Emi's on numerous occasions and we have never been disappointed
From casual dinning, to a romantic dinner to just a cocktail at the bar, Emi's takes it to a different level
The Food is incredible, Service is above and beyond, and atmosphere is one of the best in Bay Ridge
This is one place I highly recommend
This restaraunt has the essentials to be one of the best in Brooklyn and it is
The food is Outstanding and Delicious
The staff and owners were really friendly and they make you feel at home
The only bad thing is you fall in love with a dish you crave, go back for it and it's gone
Although it was no problem finding a new favorite
I was told the chef(formerly of River Cafe) is very sensitive to the quality of the dish
So if he can't find fresh-good product, he'll remove a dish from the menu which I think is fantastic
Must haves are homemade goat chees rav's - Amazing!, Branzino fish or stuffed breast of veal - WOW!
The desserts are made in house
Apple Crostata is my Favorite
Eat there now before everyone knows about it
This is a great place to go if you want an overall great dining experience
Been there a few times for dinner, brunch or just a drink (the French cosmos are fantastic) and it just keeps getting better
Make sure you save room for dessert, they are definitly worth it
Thank God there is a place on 3rd ave now, where you can enjoy a meal inside, have desert outside and enjoy an after dinner drink at the bar
This place has set the bar even higher
Its restraunts like this one we need to get back Bay Ridge to where it once was
This is an amazingly excellent restaurant
The food is unbelievable, I recommend everything (especially the sauteed calamari!)
The atmosphere is great with outdoor seating that is utterly romantic
The bar is fabulous too! This is my favorite restaurant is Bayridge if not New York City
Emi was definately a restaurant that raised the bar for Bay Ridge Brooklyn
Romantic inside, a nice secluded garden outside
You can dine in a group or dine alone with someone you love and it still reflects that intimacy that restaurants lack around here
The service was amazing, not to overbaring and the food goes well beyond your simple continental dining adding unique flavor to every dish that everyone would love!!!!! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!
This new Bay Ridge restaurant was a most pleasant surprise
Seating was available under an atrium or, as we chose, in their outdoor garden
Dining al fresco in Brooklyn was a welcome change of pace
And the food is amazing
The grilled baby octopus was perhaps the best I ever tasted
We also tried the sauteed calamari which was tender and exploding with flavor
For dinner the Branzino was wonderful
It ws roasted whole and then taken off the bone
great flavor
Dessert was a homemade apple crostada
Awesome dinner and a great addition to the neighborhood
The goat cheese ravioli and cosmopolitan's will take your breath away! Emi's garden terrace is a great escape in the middle of Brooklyn
Valet parking is a plus as well
The Scene The windowed bar and front waiting area seems bright and airy compared to the somewhat stuffy main room
Jacketed servers glide across its carpeted floors, whisking jewel-like amuse bouche from table to table in the well-appointed dining room
Established diners, older couples and serious dates fill the foodie haunt
The Food Rich, sensuous cuisine, with equal attention to texture and presentation as to taste, emerges from chef Shea Gallante's kitchen
It's hard to go wrong with his twists on the classics
The crudo is especially appealing, with the mackerel in the tartar trio presenting a palate-pleasing opening, and the sweet arctic char melting delicately on the tongue
Of the pastas, the risotto challenges with its briny combination of sea urchin and frog legs
Main courses are equally impressive, with lobster cooked to perfection and divinely tender lamb
For a savory ending, try the chocolate cake with caramel-thyme ice cream
Some of the other reviews label Cru as a waste of time due to rudeness or bad food
I did not find this ot be the case at all
Quite the opposite

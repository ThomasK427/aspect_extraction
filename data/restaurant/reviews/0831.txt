everything about this place has its own charm, i would recommend this to everybody
cheers!!
I often wonder if many of the positive comments are written by the owner! I think many of their problems are teething problems
work on the service with a smile attitude, and serve food in a timely manner
yes as I sat at the table waiting just under 1 HOUR for my food, i was quite tempted to step across the road for a quick snack
unfortunately the place is a little cramped and not somewhere where you would like to spend the whole night
Brick Lane serves the best Indian food I have ever tasted in Manhattan
Come to think of it, I have never had better
The roasted eggplant dish is divine
Brick Lane's menu offered more variety than most Indian places including some lighter dishes and a few vegan entres
Its a must go! The staff is friendly and attentive
i have been to Bricklane in london, i think these guys are far better, the waitstaff is smart and know their food
My experience was phenominal, the chef who is an Anglo-Indian , Eric was nice enough to step out of the kitchen and have a word with us, we will surely go back, thanks
their food is beyond words,,the best on this side of the world, keep the good work going
PHENOMENAL FOOD, GREAT AURA AND A SPIRITUAL AMBIENCE, PERFECT VALUE FOR MY WALLET, CHEF SATI AND THE TEAM WERE EXCELLENT HOSTS AND MADE MY VISIT TO NYC A MEMORABLE ONE
AMUST VISIT JOINT WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS
Bricklane was a pleasant surprise in boring curry row, the food was good, service staff were knowledgable and friendly with an all round pleasant atmosphere
The food was by far one of the best outside India, food was fresh, well spiced and well portioned, the FISH GOAN and the MALAI SHRIMP were by far the best Ive ever had
The best is, you can see their kitchen
as opposed to the old saw of a communal kitchen on 6th street, Reservations a must on weekends, we waited 30 mins for the earliest table
GO !
UNACCEPTABLE, ther service was ridiculous, we had to wait 20 mins until we got the waitress attention to take our order
1 hour later, as we got up to leave, the manager informed us that our order Had been given to the wrong table and are recooking it for us
On my third visit to Zana, I witnessed the most horrible behavior from a bartender I'd seen in 30 years in NYC
First she started ranting at a guy who was trying to order more drinks--he was nice, she was abusive
Something about separate checks
The poor guy kept trying to calm her down and pay his bill
Then a trio of elderly Danish tourists came in and ordered a bottle of wine
She screamed at them: You can't take that to your hotel room! (They didn't want to
) She then set out 4 glasses (for 3 people) and poured out the bottle
Their English wasn't so great, so I tried to help them
Result: When I asked--again-- for a water back for my drink, she told me, You'll get your water, but I won't serve you anymore!
I used to live in the neighborhood and I found Zana by accident
The food is fantastic and the service is top notch
They never make you feel rushed at all
I love the seafood salad and they have a decent wine selction
In the summer you can sit outside and enjoy a cocktail
I recently had dinner with a bunch of my girlfriends there and I must say the food is absolutely amazing from appetizers to dessert
The service was great, and i found them to be quite attentive on the contrary to what the other reviewer said
The prices are also affordable and the place itself is beautiful- high ceilings that are painted, the whole place is very classy, it looked like all hand done painting and there is also a real cool bar area separate from the dinner tables and a small lounge like area
Chef antonio, is a well known chef who works the kitchen there- he is marvelous! I highly recommend it, for dinner, for drinks,
or even to sit outside and enjoy their desserts!
Went there with a friend for a quick/quiet dinner two weeks ago
There's only about 7 or 8 outside tables, but if its a good day out, definitely grab one
Had a penne ala vodka and a pizza apetizer that was pretty darn good
Food came super quick and it wasn't too expensive
I don't know what someone was doing here for New Years Eve (there are a million other places), but if you're in the mood for a good bite in the neighborhood, check it out
This was my first time in a lounge atmosphere and thought it was great! I went with a few friends, all liked their food and the setting was beautiful
I've been to Cavo and I must say that from the minute you step in you automatically feel like you've been transported to a Mediterranean island
Living in Astoria I always saw their huge billboard, and indeed it is Astoria best kept secret
I took a bunch of friends there, mainly to dance, we had a blast
I'd go back to try their food
The only thing about Cavo that I and all of my friends hated was that all the greek gods were very good looking with no action
As if they were waiting on us to ask them out
This of course isn't a big deal for five gorgeous ethnical girls but at one occasion one of my friend actually asked a guy to join us in the dance floor and he just stood there! The only thing they seemed to be good at was flirting a la High School style
So ladies take note, if your ideal night out is to just hang out with your friends with lots of flirting and no action then Cavo is the spot
One of the best kept secrets in New York is that girls love guys who take them to great restaurant spots in Brooklyn and Queens as long as the cab ride doesn't take more than 20 minutes


and Cavo Cafe fits that ticket completely
Guys, the girl will be so impressed with you if you take her here and the cab ride won't break the bank
Had dinner there the other night when they were debuting some new dishes, everything we had was spectacular, nice size servings, well done
One of the owners came over, asked how things were
It's Manhattan prices with gorgeous accommodations
Can't wait to return
Spectacular dining room, gorgeous outdoor patio, great date place to linger and move into the bar area and dance
A girl could fall in love with you here, fellas
I went to Cavo the other night, and I must say I've been there in the past at least 5 times before and have truly enjoyed it
I dont know what has happened now
I went there on a date and remember it as being a nice romantic place, I learned later that it becomes a club scene in the restaurant area, with way too much music and nobody is dancing
The service was horrendous
The food was delicious and I chose the place based on knowing the ambiance was great at this place as well as the food
well the food is still good although selection has minimized, but I would never go there on a date again
I'm not saying the place is not worth going to, its great for partying, but if you are looking for a romantic date atmosphere, you will be disappointed
I couldn't believe my eyes when I first walked into this place! I certainly didn't expect 3 separate rooms including an enormous and beautiful patio
Its the perfect place to take a date, start out with dinner and then stick around for dancing!
From the minute you walk into this restaurant to the time you step out of it you are treated like royalty
The peaceful energy in this amazing place that washes over you is unbelievable
It is like a 3 part restaurant in one huge restaurant
I've NEVER been anywhere like this in my life and can't believe i'm so lucky to live only 2 blocks away from it
The food was YUMMY - the service was so good, our waiter know the menu inside out and the other waiters also keep an eye on you to make sure u're happy
I can't wait to go back again I can't wait for the summer so we can use the magnificent garden outside
This is by far the best restaurant I've been to since I've moved to New York
The first time I went, I had the pork chops
I know it doesn't sound exotic, but I had to pause between bites because it was so amazing
I never knew pork chops could taste like that!! The second time I went with a friend and we split a bunch of appetizers
Cavo is a little more expensive than most other restaurants in Astoria, but well worth it
For that kind of food in Manhattan you'd easily pay three times as much - and the ambience is amazing
Great for dates or small dinner parties
Beautiful space
The only negative is that the waitstaff sometimes waits a little too long before making their rounds, which is fine unless you have post dinner plans
Went there a few months ago with friends and had a wonderful meal
The ambience is nice, not too dark, not too bright
Had delicious calamari appetizer with two different dipping sauces and a filet mignon w/a mushroom merlot sauce
Went back last night to have a drink and nibbled on an argula salad with warm crusted goat cheese
Yummy! I hear Thursday nights there is a DJ
The burgers and steaks are good, and the Pot Roast special is great
Almost entirely filled with locals, with the occasional pre-movie drink-takers
Its an old bar, so the decor, while it has its charm, is a bit worn
The ever-changing waitresses are usually pretty nice

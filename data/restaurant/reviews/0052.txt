The food is consistanly good for a reasonable prices and service is even better
The waiters and waitresses are very friendly (funny too!)
The young fellow, with charm makes you feel at home, order off the menu, or let you dicide what to eat
The atmosphere is very relaxing
If you are looking for mediocre food that Zucchero y Pomodoro calls Italian, stop by this factory-style restaurant, which tries, but fails, at being trendy
The food is 'run-of-the-mill', the management is trashy, and the place is always noisy
Do yourself a favor and stay away
Excellent dining experience
They accomodated my boyfriend and I for outside seating on a busy Sunday night easily
The waiters and busboys were very quick and serviced us like we were at a very expensive restaurant
The prices were extremely reasonable and we had a wonderful time
Would definitely go back often
Very good Italian on the upper east side at fair prices
Fish and tomato sauce both have great flavors and the dishes are under $20
I found the service to be very good, but I don't recommend eating outside
Seating is cramped and feel like you are sitting at neighbor's table
This fabulous quaint, italian restaurant is the perfect spot on any night
the food is good and the prices are even better
You really don't need reservations and you can find a spot in either of their rooms
Always good, with good service, atmosphere and of course, prices
One of my favorite reliable UES restaurants!
Best pasta dishes for the price in NYC! Service is excellent as well! Check out their Sunday brunch
If you're in the 'hood, definitely stop in
the mushroom barley soup is amazing
As are the veggie lasagna and the mac cheese
They guys who work there are super-firendly and you can't get cheaper home-cooked food in manhattan
It's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book
Stay away if you're claustrophobic
In Short By day, Wall Street wheeler-dealers, bargain shoppers and Ground Zero tourists come for the bountiful all-you-can-eat buffet
By night, when the Chambers Street strip empties out, this affordable Indian eatery can be a quiet haven
Flavorful Indian favorites like vegetable pakora, lamb tikka masala and tandoori chicken, as well as unexpected offerings such as Alaska king crab legs and fried coconut shrimp, are served at extremely reasonable prices
I really like this place
Especially compared to some of the dingy places in the downtown area, this place stands out
I think the $10
95 lunch buffet is a great value -- the muligatawny soup is truly delicious
I don't usually give much though to muligatawny soup, but WOW, that is REALLY good
The service is very nice, the naan is made fresh to order, and the service is very nice and polite
I always leave there glad that I went
Went for lunch but wanted to order a la carte, which was so highly discouraged by the waiter (pushing the 10
95 buffet) that it became basically impossible to do so
So we all did the buffet--one of my companions liked the lamb very much
The tandoori chicken was not tasty and what looked like breast pieces to me had odd amounts of dark meat
The chick pea/eggplant dish was quite bland, and the saag paneer was a huge disappointment--more like some kid's worst experience of creamed spinach with tofu-like cheese
Next time, it's PAKISTANI TEA HOUSE all the way
For a birthday party in our office we had food delivered for 15 persons
It was marvelous with spicy and plentiful
Best bhindi I've had in the city and fine lamb and chana and everything else was just super
We went for Buffet lunch and the sauce was water down, not at all spicy
If you want the real Indian food I suggest going somewhere else
The Scene  The cornucopia of paper fruit decorations dangling overhead lends a festive atmosphere to this tiny New York institution
Groups of loud teenagers, downtown fashionistas, button-downed office workers--all wait patiently as a small troop of red-clad employees work at a feverish pace preparing heaps of frankfurters for the budget-minded masses
Customers wolf down their dogs while standing on the yellow-tiled floor, chatting casually and resting their drinks on a narrow countertop
The Food The menu is perfect for the indecisive, its sole option a long, thin, juicy hot dog served in a standard bun
Topping a dog with everything means piles of mustard, ketchup, and a sweet combination of onions and sauerkraut
The defining characteristic of this popular restaurant, aside from dirt-cheap hot dogs, is the beverage selection, which includes a light and refreshing papaya juice, an extremely sweet pineapple juice and a sweet and frothy pina colada drink
The hot dogs are the closest thing I've had to a campfire hot dog short of going camping
You definitely get your money's worth -drinks included
What they lack in seating they make up for in quality, but if you're looking for a grab and go meal this is perfect
hot dogs
Really what more is there to say about this place
U plop down ur $2
45 and pick up ur 2 dogs and a papaya
Quick, easy, tasty, and painless
It's as simple as that
Oh and try the bananna daquiris, thems good drinkin
I used to stop in for lunch many a time when I was at NYU
Good and cheap, what more can you ask
Always a good place to go after hitting the bars/clubs
All you have to do is pull out whatever singles and change are in you pockets and you're good to go
I always try to make it there when I'm in the area
One of them crave things
On those late nights, after many drinks, I would stumble into this place
Hot dogs are great and cheap here
The hot dogs snap when you bite 'em
The drinks are fruity and delicious
The guys behind the counter are quick and funny
If you've never gone there before, it's worth it to stop in, even if you're not hungry
West Village Saturday night drinking should ALWAYS be followed up by a Gray's Papaya hot dog
Or two
Come on, they're 75 cents each! Makes the train ride home much more bearable, and the hangover less painful
This is the place for New York hotdogs
The place is not meant for in house dining, but if you want to grab a meal on the go, this is the perfect choice
This is something real New Yorker's enjoy and share with select out of towners
Great college meal
Two dogs and a drink for $2
45! I went here because of the movie Fools Rush in and the place was hoppin'
It is a great little slice of NYC life
The counter guys are friendly enough for the 2 seconds it takes to make the hot dog and pay
They keep things well ordered
Very good for a meal on the run
These are the best hot dogs you will ever eat! Almost impossible to eat just one-they are addicting!! The recession special is a great deal! Awesome!!
YUM! I loved Gray's Papaya, the hot dogs were fresh, yummy, and cheap
And the Banana daquiri was delish! Great New York treat!!
All I can say is mmmm mmmm mmmm I grabbed a hot dog after a late night out and it was pure heaven
They were hot and crisp
Very yummy!
Have been going here for years
Food is always good: fresh, consistent, and straight-forward
Service is wonderful--feels like a neighborhood place
Excellent value, better than most Italian restaurants in the City but completely affordable

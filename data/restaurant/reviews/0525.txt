In mi burrito, here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste
For about $8 a pop, it's not really a bargain either
Cafe Monte shares the kitchen with the Italian restaurant, Bona Fides, next door
Since you can order from Bona Fides' menu, this is a great place to go if you have a party of people in which one person wants to have a full meal, another a cup of coffee, and another a bottle of beer with a snack
Don't be discouraged by what's on display; just ask, they'll have it
This was one of the few times I stumbled upon a restaurant when I was hungry in Midtown and was very pleasantly surprised! I ordered the meat lasagna and can say it was one of the best I've had other than a fresh homemade one
The octopus salad was quite good as well
The service wasn't the best, but the perfect macchiato at the end of my meal is what sealed it for me: I will definitely be back here in the near future!
This is the type of place you can be a regular
my boyfriend and I are
The pastas and soups are great, but I have to disagree with the previous reviewer--my boyfriend's only bad experience was with a special
I'd stick with the regular menu, generally
The decor is simple, but clean and bright
Good traditional italian food, but nothing is extraordinary
Go with the specials, and stay away from the salmon
The pastas were pretty good
Atmosphere is a bore
Bottomline: good value for the dollar, but nothing special
Might go back with a big group, but otherwise, I'll keep shopping for my favorite local Italian Hole-in-the-wall
I was reading some reviews and must add my $0

This is my favorite salad place in New York
The food is all so fresh and so good
The salads are huge, and the toppings are plentiful (both to choose from, and the amount they serve), unike other places
I love the build your own option, great dressings, and the Palm Salad
They're not cheap, but the prices are comparable with other NY salad eateries (often cheaper, and not as stingy with the carrots)
The service is always fast and friendly (very friendly!), the restaurant clean, and the clientele an interesting mix
A lot of hot people eat here
It's a good place to meet up with a friend while shopping, grab lunch (although the lines do get long), dining solo, or to take home after work
Has anyone noticed that the price of the salads here seem to go up all the time? At first it was an obvious price increase, then it became slightly more subtle; they started to charge extra for what most expensive salad places include, and then they reduced the size of the container ! Decent saled but way overpriced, it is a good example to show friends from out of town (I was born bred here) how outragious the NEW YORK CITY prices realy are
If you're hungry don't bother ordering from Chopt
i'm at my computer 1
5 hours after placing an order
when i called on the status the staff was rude and said they just had a shift change
I ordered at 12:30
what kind of time is that to have a delivery shift change? Rude, rude, rude
bad service
the salads aren't all that
DON'T BOTHER
Servers here have a really arrogant attitude and treat customers as though they are an inconvenience
Salad ingredients are added in tiny cupfuls making this a very bad value salad
The only thing they do well is, like the name says, chop the salad
I'd rather save the $5 extra this service costs and go to a deli
Value, selection and good food
Definitely worth the visit for lunch or dinner
Go here if you want fresh and tasty salads of any type you can imagine
They have standard varieties as well as a build-your-own option
The lines at lunch can be enormous, but the huge and superb meals are worth the wait
The Scene Brick, leather, big tables and soaring ceilings establish the steakhouse mood
A convivial, executive clientele rubs shoulders with a younger, downtown crowd of protein aficionados
The structured, systematized service--which includes ferrying skewers of meat around--is friendly but highly susceptible to glitches
The Food A flat charge buys two all-you-can-eat courses: First, unlimited access to the salad bar and buffet, then a continuous flow of skewered meats
The buffet runs a fish-centric gamut from savory casseroles and coconut-milk stews to toughish scallops and decent sushi
And then the deluge: 15 or so different kinds of meat, all sliced at the table
The rodizio grill yields primarily well-done meats, so filet mignon, pork loin and ribs can be dry, underscored by the kitchen's heavy hand with salt, but crusty flank steaks and sirloins and juicy little sausages drip with flavor
Eat your fill of meat and skip the dessert cart
My mom threw my dad a surprise 60th birthday saturday brunch there
It was awesome
Food was great, service was good
And it is on the pricey side so go during lunch hours
And it's best to go with a BIG group
The down side: lunch buffet does not sushi or sashimi
yes, it is very expensive, but it is for a reason! unlike many buffets, churrascaria tribeca leaves you full
the meat is great, tho there were some i disliked, the different meats came by so often i was able to get the ones i liked! recommend going with a credit card, and an empty stomach!
The meats are delicious, the buffet fresh
But make no mistake -- churrascarias are all about meat
Plataforma offers almost all the varieties you'd find in Brazil
The previous complaint that the meats are too salty is way off base -- that's how meats are seasoned in Brazil
It's authentic! Of course the prices are drastically higher, but that's New York for you
The decor is beautiful, but I'm knocking points off for ambience for the clientele
They're almost entirely bankers, and overwhelmingly male
We were surrounded by large tables of these guys, boasting of their conquests, and they were so loud it often required extra effort to carry on a conversation over them
Plataforma is genuinely Brazilian, but the crowds of striped ties make it impossible to forget you're only a short ride from Wall Street
I'll definitely return, but next time I'll try their midtown location
Serivce is great, food is great, and the money is well expend
My boyfriend and I disliked the midtown location (so UES Banker) and then hit the one in Tribeca (very sexy, very loungy)--it is now the place we go to celebrate any special occasion
Yes, it is expenisve--VERY expensive
Dinner with 4 drinks and tip will cost you close to 200

However, if you are going out and willing to spend it, this is a surefire hit
The meats are great, the sides are phenomenal and the salad bar has everything from excellent sushi to wonderfully poached fish and yummy shrimp cocktail
Ok so went here with a group of 10 or so guys for a Bachelor party and had a great time -service was good, they had a nice salad bar that had a good variety of items including a few very nice fish salads(seafood,squid etc) as well as decent sushi and a variety of Brazilian dishes-so i was impressed right off the bat so then we sit down flip our cards to green and let the games begin -the meats-thats why one comes no??thats where the disappointment occured everything was overcooked and oversalted
The service was great the people were beautiful even saw a random celeb but the whole point of the trip was the meat and that was a total disappointment-saved by the salad bar
I did not like the one in mid-town (food was good but staff was stiff and rude) but this one is awesome
I'm actually going here tonight with my fiance and my future in-laws
I took my fiance here once, and he fell in love! So he suggested that when his parents come in town to visit, we have to introduce them to churrascaria
Seems like churrascaria isn't that popular in NYC unlike LA and I've been looking for a good place
Although it's a bit pricy, I think it's all worth it
Don't forget to have pao de queijo (cheese bread, small and round) and top it off with refreshing guarana drink
This is definitely the better of the two
We've been to Midtown several times, but keep returning to TriBeCa
With just two visits, they remembered our faces and names, what meats we did and didn't like, which side we prefer and if we prefer well done or rare
We always take guests, and the servers and manager always make it a point to stop by, greet myself, my fiance and our guests by name
Midtown is far more rushed and far less personable
While NYC does not have a Fogo de Chao this place will do well
The value and service were poor for the money
Food is average served with a little showmanship
Watch out for extremly high alcohol prices and deserts are a huge additional charge
This place is so good
They marinate the meat for hours and it just keeps coming out

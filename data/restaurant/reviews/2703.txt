The staff is friendly and highly competent
The Food The gently updated rustic Italian menu is hearty, subtle, and interesting
Classic starters are carefully rendered: tomato-and-mozzarella salad employs quality ingredients, and plump mussels in tomato broth are deeply flavored
Entrees, like beautifully tender osso buco with pungent gremolata, and fragrant, savory and steaming mushroom risotto, are equally winning
The house gnocchi are soft, light and lovely in sage butter, but venison ragu du jour, though sweetly delectable, makes a coarse bedfellow for it
Occasional kitchen missteps, such as too-tough rabbit, are easily forgotten due to their rarity and ultra-reasonable price point
Chocolaty tiramisu makes a fine closer
We were wowed by the salmon with escarole and white beans
However, the gnocchi pomodoro was very disappointing
We weren't expecting Grandmom's Gnocchi, but the gummy texture of their dumplings made us wonder if it was the Chef's night off and we were stuck with the understudy
Dessert was equally unbalanced
The lemon goat cheesecake was extremely dry and practically begged for a nice sauce or some fresh fruit
Alternately, the chocolate mousse was incredibly rich, smooth and decadent
The good stuff was SO good that I'd be willing to give Noodle Pudding one more shot
Had the calves liver alla veneziana in a fine rich and complex sauce with perfectly fried onions
It came with baked mashed potatoes and a fine garlicky spinach
The bread was fresh, the olive oil dip nicely spiced
My friend was satisfied with his salmon with white beans and greens
The fact that the dishes have their unique sides speaks volumes; there're real attention to the food
The waitstaff are waiters, not models passing time
We went round 7pm on a Saturday, were seated in 10 minutes
I liked the feel of the place from the get go, bustling and alive
That said it was on the noisy side, not really what I'd call romantic
The neighborhood's great for strolling
My wife and I visited New York late in April of 2006, and ate at Noodle Pudding on a Saturday evening
We were told that no reservations were necessary, and waited 45 mins
for a table
The sevice and food were excelent, but at the bottom of the menu were the words, cash only
I was directed to a fruit and vegitable mkt
with an ATM while we were waiting for our meal
It was a little smaller than expected and a bit noisier by the bar
Upper east side moved to Brooklyn
Food is always delicious, great service, great value
I highly recommend it
Our first time eating in Brooklyn and it was great
It was hard to find parking but that was the only negative
We were promptly seated within 5 minutes on a Saturday evening
We had lasagna and a four meats pasta which were both delicious
The restaurant is only a four block walk from the Brooklyn Promenade which is another plus! I will definitely go back
My husband and I totally love this place, in fact he proposed to me at Noodle Pudding in 2001
The pork chop is to die for and the simple pomodoro sauce is excellent
The owner is wonderful and always remembers his customers
Since my husband and I moved from Bklyn Heights to Jersey, we take special trips every so often to this Bklyn gem
It's hard to imagine perfection but Noodle Pudding comes very, very close
Warm, unpretentious, homey, up and always delicious, it's the perfect antidote to whatever's making you totally crazy
Try the Frico (a savory 4 cheese asparagus wrap) appetizer, the Short Ribs or the melt-in-your mouth lasagna as a main course and any dessert that hasn't already been devoured right off the menu
If that doesn't make you a regular patron (an unlikely event), then the owner, Tony and the excellent wait staff who make you feel like family, will
A very special place!
This is such a great place
The service is terrific too! I have never had a bad meal there
In fact, it's such a treat to go to Noodle Pudding - they always make you feel at home
Perfect description
A wonderful neighborhood place
Warm and inviting in the winter and delightful in the summer when they open the front windows
Food is generally hard to beat
Service is usually very professional
Walking in on a cold fall night, it is not hard to understand why this popular Brooklyn Heights neighborhood restaurant is a big hit
Noodle Pudding simply oozes warmth, good Italian food and friendly service
The prices are more than affordable, and you are dining in a romantic golden colored candle lit room
The menu focuses on classic dishes with an adventurous twist
The pappardelle with venison ragu was simple but yet so flavorful
Although tiramisu was ordered on every other table, and looked very yummy, at the end of our meal I was simply too full to try
Now, if only someone could explain whats up with the name of the place?
Reasonably priced, anything but a trendy crowd and a romantic atmosphere, made for a wonderful experience at Noodle Pudding! MUST try the mashed eggplant and ricotta pasta dish
absolutely to die for!
Awesome
I love this place
I work in Metrotech and take clients here all the time
This place rocks
Sad- no Credit Cards, but the Osso Bucco makes up for it!
You have to try it out yourself
I was completly satisfied with all the food, service and especially the cute young staff, :-)
Another great place to dine in the Heights
This cozy and trendy spot is a great place to meet up with friends either before or after your trek on the Promenade
The night scene is a bit more impressive than the lunch scene, so try to arrive a little later in the evening
The food is what you would expect to find in a trendier cafe - catered more to the hip yuppycrowd than a family of 4-5
Again, a great place to meet up with your friends for some brew or cocktails and an evening bite - just don't forget take a stroll on the promenade afterwards for the real treat
Enjoy!
The food is good, but with so many restaurants in the neighborhood, and of course, manhattan, you can find a more impressive menu for the same value, or less, in a restaurant with better service and ambience
The Heights Cafe has awkward seating, most of the tables extend from a shared bench, destroying any dining intimacy, as you continue to elbow diners next to you The space in general is bit too big to be intimate, and it seems to be overstaffed, as throughout our dinner we had hovering waitstaff, who were either anxious for turnover, or they were bored and didn't know what to do with their time
All in all, distracting from a pleasant meal
If you want charming, high quality dining try Henry's End
The ambience is warm and welcoming, especially when we came in during a downpour
And the service was very good
But everything else was just ok -- uninspired menu, uninspired food, slightly too expensive considering the previous two things
Nice place for a date, but there are better restaurants in the area
I group of us went to the heights cafe recently - it was my first visit and i was thoroughly impressed
The service was excellent, the food was very good and the price was fair
We live in the neighborhood so we thought we'd give them another chance after uneven experiences before
If you do go there, be prepared to spend a while
It took 45 minutes for us to get our brunch order
Odd considering my brunch turned out to be a nuked hors d'oevre quiche tart on a plate with some wilted/slightly spoiled salad - what a rip-off! To be fair, my husband's cheeseburger was quite good, but the waitress never apologized for the long wait or attempted to explain
A better restaurant might have comped our lemonades, but not here
There are too many other good restaurants in the area to waste another meal or $ here
There are at least 10 Mexican restaurants within a mile of Borough Hall, but the New Mexicali is by far the best
They moved to a new spot on Court Street a few months ago that is much cleaner and larger
The food is phenomenal, particularly any of the sauces (mole, verde, al pipian) on the enchiladas
The owners are incredibly nice too, comping pitchers of margaritas if you sit there and eat for a couple of hours
The food here is amazing
The ambience is horrible but the food is incredible

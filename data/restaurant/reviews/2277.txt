The establishment itself is not large or fancy, perfect for couples and groups of 4-5
Pricewise it won't set you back too much and the portions of the food are decent
I love their French Onion soup, Corned Beef Hash, and their delicious Spaghetti and Meatballs
One might want to avoid the salad and french fries as a side
Now that the place is 24 hours, it will be hard not to make this a nice late night spot along 8th Avenue
Went to Red Garlic for dinner today and was really taken aback by how good it was! Every dish was not only delicious but also beautifully presented -- you'd have thought we were at a much higher-priced establishment
The desserts were to die for
not so Thai, per se, but still incredible! Try the roast pear or the Godiva glace
All in all, I was very impressed with Red Garlic and will definitely be going back
I love Thai food, and I was very impressed with Red Garlic
The flavors were outstanding - I savored every bite
They also accomodated my off-the-menu traditional thai entree request
I've been twice and both times I was very impressed by the food
It is Thai but with a twist--many original dishes that I had never heard of and I've been to quite a few thai restaurants
Service was not spectacular but good for the price and they were very accomodating with our tight schedule
The decor was inviting--the candles around the room added a nice touch
I love Thai
THis place was perfect for me
Not overly New York, not overly plain
I found the food quite good, and pretty resonably priced
The service is not he best, but the wait staff is very accomadating
I would recommend it
This is one of the few restaurants in the Times Square vicinity that doesn't ooze touristy glitz or fake elegance
I've been here twice now and both times I've enjoyed the simple, romantic ambience and friendly service
Portions are rather small, but the food's always been delicious
I was very underwhelmed by Red Garlic
The food was okay, but the service was truly terrible
Portions were small and prices were large
The one standout was the mussels with bacon appetizer
they were delicious (overpriced, but good)
Otherwise, the food was bland (even when ordered extra spicy) and I didn't detect a hint of garlic in anything!
The Scene With tile floors, polished wood details and brass nameplates that boast dozens of stars who've sat in your booth, this bright diner serves an idealized version of '50s New York dining
Go ahead, give in with an egg cream and a tall slice of "Aunt Esther's" cheesecake--you can't help but have fun here
Expect cramped seating, rushed but friendly service and lots of happy kids
The Food The menu features gargantuan diner classics that pay tribute to Brooklyn's varied culinary traditions
Start with full-flavored chicken soup or velvety chopped chicken liver before moving on to juicy burgers with piles of fries, and inch-wide, snappy-skinned "15-bite hot dogs" with juniper-studded sauerkraut
Fancier appetites will relish the sweet, bacon-rich lump crabcake club
Thick-sauced spaghetti and the Mixed Marriage--a fried egg in challah with tomato sauce, spicy Italian sausage and fried polenta--are standouts as well
Beware of this restaurant! Just because the word diner is in the name
You will be spending a lot of money on average food! I ordered a cheeseburger with fries
The cheeseburger was just OK
The fries were awful - dry and tasteless
The Strawberry Blond Cheesecake was very good, but was way too much for one person
My bill for just myself came to over $28! Next time, I'll just go to MacDonalds for yummy cheeseburgers and fries for a lot less money!!
place is ok but small and crowded
prices are average for the area
I had the Cuban Skirt steak which was good
Extremely busy during lunch
20min wait for seating
My best friend and I were nervous about trying a diner for dinner while visiting the Big Apple from Los Angeles
(We now live in New England - Go SOX!) We were pleasantly surprised by the prompt and attentive service
Waiters are in tux updo's and their Veggie burger is to DIE for! Fries are awesome -crisp and fresh
The Hummus is so fresh and delightful as well
Trust me, when I comes to food, my best friend and I travel the U
S
in search of good food
We've been back to NY three times and we always stop at Brooklyn Diner!
I was skeptical when my friends suggested dinner here during a recent NYC visit--surely there were better dining choices in the area to experience than a DINER, I thought
Well, was I in for a surprise! The cuban-style steak with plantains and rice beans I ordered was as good as I'd expect to find in an upscale Cuban restaurant; my boyfriend's tenderloin steak was not only huge but perfectly cooked
The chicken pot pie special of the night was literally an entire PIE, and looked delicious
I couldn't resist trying the double chocolate pudding pie for dessert and it was well worth the calories
Match the great food with reasonable (for New York) prices, decent wine by the glass, and efficient service, and you definitely have a winning choice
I would happily return!
We visited on 2/24/04 for breakfast, my husband and I had the french toast, my child had pancakes
She ended up wanting to eat my french toast! The pancakes were OK (my husband makes the best, so it is hard to top him) but the french toast was superb
Nice locations, fun watching everyone rush into work at the building next door
Recommend!
Nice views if you can score a window booth, but the atmosphere is too fast frenetic to make you want to linger
Breakfast could use some panache -- it was rather dull
Wonderful big city diner with absolutely the largest portions of very delicious food at moderate prices
It is a must for lunch,dinner or anytime you have a big appetite and don't want to spend big bucks in the big Apple!
Friendly staff, occasional celebrity spottings, great service, and the best burger in town!
what can I say food fit for a king or queen
Food was fresh and delicious
Service was great, the best french toast I have ever had in my life
My friends and I have been saying that this is the best food on Manhattan since our first visit in August 1997
Visitng Manhattan several times each year is made complete only by visiting this celestial diner in the heart of mid-town
The Baked Macaroni and Cheese recieves a rousing standing ovation
The Chicken Pot Pie, Turkey Burger, Panckaes, Chicken Liver Paradise, Bubba's Chicken, Real Chiken Noodle Soup, Crab Cakes, and Strawberry Blond Cheesecake are only a few of the heavenly creations
You should not miss this truly one of kind experience
This is Manhattan's BEST!!
Good sit-down lunch place on 57th Street
Large selection of wraps, salads, and sandwiches
Small tables crowded together, slight 'old world' (dark woodwork) atmosphere but you can usually get a table without waiting forever
I visited this store with my husband a week ago while we were walking along the beautiful 7 avenue
The food was good but the atmosphere was horrible and what shocked me is the employee treatment by a tall supervisor!
The restuarant looked appealing, and the service was excellent
But I spent $10 for a small, fast-food style lunch, and left with a stomach ache
And being vegetarian, they did not have many food options for me
Did not seem worth it
The place was great
The menu was huge and so were the portions
This would be an excelllent spot for lunch
Sandwiches with a nice original touch
Wonderful selction of fresh fish too!
In an area packed with little hole-in-the-wall burger joints, Route 66 is a standout
The prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is welcoming, and the food is great
Their chicken cobb salad is the best I've had anywhere
a far cry from the usual bowl of iceberg lettuce
Portions are large and prices are small

The food is good old Irish fried stuff that hits home on nights you just want to eat greasy and watch a game
And when the other Irish pubs of the neighborhood are sickly crowded, this place is a good place to actually find a seat at the bar
We do what we call Booza Palooza's, which are neighborhood themed afternoons of careless and stupid drinking
Sometimes as many as 10 of us or as few as two
McAleers is always the starting point on the upper west side
Great place with good service and nice people
The last time we were there, we stayed a little longer than planned and were signifacantly smashed at the end of the day
This is an ideal neighborhood pub
For NYC, the prices are as low as you can go and they have a great selection of beers, including two McAleer's microbrews
The food is great for what it is and they have a great burger and the best grilled cheese in the city
As for the atmosphere, there is nowhere that I've found where one can find such a comfortable, warm environment with good tunes and plenty of TV's and still be served by such gorgeous ladies! Cheers to McAleer's!
This place is great if you want to get a beer, have a burger, and watch a game on TV
Nothing special, just a good neighborhood joint
I enjoy this place
Although the waitress let us know there was an hour wait for food, it took nearly twice as long for the mediocre grub to emerge
During that time, we had to get up and look for her any time we wanted another beer, and then to obtain and pay the bill
In fact, the only time she came over quickly all night was to check the tip on the bill right in front of us, and then openly complain about the 10% that we left (which she didn't even deserve)
Completely not worth it
It's too bad that CitySearch gives this restaurant such a polite review, because it certainly does not deserve it nor is worth the business
The food is positively blah, service is possibly the worst ever, and the music is on so loud that you are unable to maintain a conversation! In fact, it was so loud that the bartender was unable to understand anything I was saying
This might explain why my order was completely screwed up
Good food, and OK drinks, but the place is drab!
This place has friendly bartenders A diverse crowd ,from the 70 year old former dentist to the Columbia students to the UWS yuppies
A great place to grab a drink and even some pub grub, but don't expect a scene
THE FOOD IS VERY GOOD
TRY THE PORK CHOPS AND WORK YOUR WAY OUT FROM THERE
FRIED DUMPLINGS ARE THE BEST IVE HAD
STAFF IS JUST THE BEST
IF YOU GO YOU MAY SEE ME BY THE WINDOW NEAR RHE DOOR
ENJOY
I think the restaurant is horrid! The calamari was tough as tires, the rice was undercooked, the sauces was watery and gross
If you live in NYC and have not been to La Caridad than you are cheating yourself out of a great New York experience
This is stick to your ribs type stuff at a great price
I would stick to the Cuban food in particular the beef stew
This is not necessarily a date place but if you are looking for a good meal on the cheap you cant be La Caridad
Im getting hungry just writing about this place
Next time you go to a show at the Beacon stop by here first for a great meal
It's 90% Chinese, 10% Cuban
The food is cheap but one of the waiters treats his customers like dogs
The portion is big so eat quick and leave!
$10 (including tip) gets you three monster pork chops with a side of sweet plantains and salad
And that is about the most expensive thing on the menu
Excellent value and consistently good
I am a frequent Diner at Caridad's
The food is always delicious and made to order
Even if it's not on the menu they usually have it
There are some things as hispanics we love to eat, but the prep time is not available
The Service is good, sometimes when it's packed you can wait about half hour for the food
I think that is the only incovenience I have encountered
Overall, I Love this restaurant
the best diner food on the west side but they haven't gotten a delivery order right yet
much better idea to eat there, fabulous food
i just wish that they would check their delivery orders before they send them out
the deliveries are fast but not right
i hope they can improve on this because the food is the best
Nice neon retro design to the place to stir up the Norman Rockwell images in you
Followed by consistently friendly service that never fails to disappoint
The highlight (for me at least) is the breakfast, which kicks all kinds of butt no matter what you choose
You haven't lived till you've tried their scrambled eggs, sausage, and home fries in the brisk early morning hours
Though there's nothing particularly extraordinary about this place (besides once spotting Richard Dreyfuss eating breakfast behind me), I frequent it, nonetheless, because the grub food is dependable, and the servings are generous
Weekend brunch is often the best meal - the place gets packed by local families, old folks, and students
It gives you a real sense of the neighborhood
The atmosphere is bright and clean, with large windows, where you can get a good view of the corner of Broadway and 100th Street, a place which is now rapidly changing
My favorite food items are their strawberry milkshake, bacon cheese burger, and guacamole
Their orange juice is also very fresh
And, unlike most diners, they serve a fair share of vegetarian dishes
Every time my family comes to visit they want to go to this diner for a casual yet delicious dinner
Of the many times we have been here, we have all (including family friends) enjoyed our meals, including Thanksgiving dinner! The ambience is also more funky and stylish than most local diners
Clean diner with quick service but make sure you all get the same thing or tell the waiter to bring it out when its ready
My food was hot but my friends was cold, cold, cold
When I think good bagels I think Absolute
Their texture is perfect, their taste is perfect, their selection is perfect
The staff is friendly
I adore the young countermaid, she completely slays me
My favorite bagel selection is the everything with lox spread
Morning heaven whenever I can get it
We love the bagels here - the texture is superb--soft but substantial and chewy in a good way (nothing like a fakey Lenders bagel)
Definitely worth a trip up to Morningside
Customer service in general is fine--the Thai owner(s) are very very friendly once they once they get to know you as a regular
(Unfortunately, however, I've had a rude and upsetting experience with one of their non-Thai staffers in the afternoon
)   Bagels are near perfection, but if they want to maintain a steady customer base --ie
-- recurring revenue from neighborhood residents--they need to make sure their counter staffers don't get nasty with the customers
No matter how great the bagels are, I'm not going to want to go back for a while if I have to deal with a snippy guy at the counter
The bagels here always have excellent flavor and texture
I recommend Absolute highly
They are definitely the best bagels in the city
They're chewy and have the perfect consistency and are always fresh
and usually warm as well
Amazing! Also, the people there are really really nice
Every time I go home my family makes me bring back a dozen of their bagels
Much preferred over Nussbaum Wu or any other bagel joints nearby
Worth the trip
The bagels themselves are great, but what really sets Absolute apart are their creative and unusual topping options--try an egg bagel with bacon and cheddar cream cheese or a whole wheat bagel with dutch apple cream cheese for something different in your morning routine
However, you may want to bring your own drink, as their cooler is poorly stocked with a very limited variety of beverages
Not only are the bagels and spreads fantastic, but if you go there often enough, Paul will bump you to the front of the line (even if it's cops!)! Who can beat that for service???
Luckily, the Fates have allocated a perfectly timed moment between my waking and when my train comes, a moment where, like clockwork, the ovens of Absolute steamily open, and hundreds of fiendishly parboiled-then-baked-to-perfection loops of dough are sorted by shifty hands between the various bready bins
Too freshly hot to hold a dollop of tofutti without it oozing out on the train, but better plain anyhow, this 60-cent gem of New York cookery has become a faithful part of my morning waking routine, as it will probably stay, even when something better to occupy my morning moments comes along
This starchy sucker is worth waking up earlier for
Surprising variety and freshness for such a small shop
Buy the bagels and use your own spread for a value

We totally enjoyed our visit to this resturant
We seen it advertised on Cable and we decided since we live on the UWS that we should try this place out! What a great meal we had
The steaks and fish were superb
I can't wait to return for another good meal
A bit pricey but well worth the money
The service was easy and smooth throughout the whole meal
The manager bid us farewell and we sent our kudos to him
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites
From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic
Please try the Filet Mignon, its just the most tender piece ever
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth
To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate
If you go to Roth's try to be served by Mike, he is GREAT!!
On our last visit our reservations were not honored for over 20 minutes and when we were sat the table was simply awful
We explained that we wouldn't mind waiting again for a better table - that proved to be 40 minutes
Most disconcerting was when we received our entrees both dishes (a Delomonico steak and the Surf and Turf) were stone cold
The service was no better our waitress simply disappeared (we were told it was her last day) and the waiter that took over left us for unreasonable amounts of time when we wanted to order
It was one of my worst dining experiences
The only saving grace is that Roth's has a great bartender who knows how to make a drink and they have a fantastic house jazz singer/band
I would not go back for the food but I would go back for a drink/jazz
Meal was very expensive for what you get
The $72 Delmonico steak had to be sent back because it was not cooked to order
Go into the heart of Manhattan for the full dining experience
No need to go to upper Westside
The Management was less than accomodating
Took my gf there for Brunch around 2 pm (Sunday)
Ordered the fix Brunch menu $13
95 (seafood omelet, onion soup, OJ) and I had steak sandwidch ($15)
Soup was tasty, OJ good, omelet lots of seafood
My steak is delicious w/ lots of fries
Refill bread/muffins We liked the food a lot, very full too, but we like more about the whole attitude/feeling
It was late brunch so it's pretty empty, we were greeted by owners, seated promptly with breads up right away
Live Jazz was excellent, it was really romantic setting and waiters are friendly helpful too, no -ve attitudes at all
Let us used GC as well, and we tipped generously
Would highly recommend plan to go back in future w/ friends But not sure I'll want to go there for pricey dinner :(
I would try going here again although my first experience was average
I went with a group of 12
They are definitely not used to handling that many people
The food was good
And I will give and E for Effort on the service because they tried
A little unusual NYC steak house
More spartan and modern than the typical Sparks/SmithWollensky kind of recipe
It's a good place to meet up as you can actually talk to eachother as the noise level is comfortable
The service is very friendly and unassuming and lacks the negative and sometime superficial treatment you can get at a typical NYC seakhouse
No grumpy waiters here
I like the atmosphere and it's a friendly place one goes with a friend or the like (and perhaps not for business)
And the steaks are very very good
Try the delmonico in Philadelphia style! It's very very good
The winel list was not that great and some wines were out - and that is not good
Maybe it was just this one time but one should not accept that
Last night we went to Roth's Steakhouse
As soon as we were seated our waiter declared they were out of the porterhouse
After 3 of us ordered the filet mignon, the waiter came back to tell us they only had one left
Nothing was offered to make up for the half menu
I don't remember ever running into this problem at any other steakhouses
The jazz was a great touch!
Don't get me wrong, everything was fine at Roth's
but that was it, it was just ok
My girlfriend and I split the porterhouse and it was just alright
Seriously I've had friends grill just as flavorable steaks at a barbeque
The sides were flat out disapointing, the mashed potatoes could have been out of a box and the spinach was bland
I'm not trying to totally trash the place because they definately tried hard, it was just a little uninspired
Usually when I blow a bunch of cash on a steak in this city I know damn well where my money went, not so much with Roth's
The presentation was good however, and the atmosphere is unique to the city
If that's what you're into, give it a shot, otherwise, stick to the basics
We went to Roth's to celebrate my sister's birthday
Food was excellent, not just the steaks, but everything on the menu
Overall, the value was good
I don't eat in NYC often, but it was the price was comparable to eating in Suburbs
My brother was shocked at the price, thought it would have been a lot more
Old world charm - jazz music, great steaks and chops, creamed spinnach to die for
Knowledgeable service and fun (allbeit cramped) space
Expensive but worth every penny
I had dinner at Roth's last night with my boyfriend and we both thoroughly enjoyed it
I was very impressed with the way the various cuts of meat were shown and explained to us
We ordered the porterhouse for two and it was GREAT (as was the garlic mashed potatoes and the sauteed spinach and mushrooms!) But perhaps the most impressive thing about the evening was the service which was, perhaps, the best I've ever received at ANY restaurant
Treat yourself to a great steak at Roth's
You won't be disappointed!
Having experianced Roth's for the first time this past Saturday, I must say I can't wait to return! The service was exceptional and all of the food that was served to our party of eight was absolutely perfect
Generally it is quite difficult to please such a large group, but everyone was more than satisfied - I did not hear one negative comment from the group all night long (amazing)
I personally recommend the crab cakes, the crab cocktail, and the T Bone - all out of this world
All of the staff were very attentive to our needs - as if they all owned the place
My congratulations to management - the night was perfect
Please by all means - Go and enjoy!!!
If you're looking for a wonderful steakhouse without all of the pretentiousness, then Roth's is for you! The staff are disarmingly nice, and our waiter was knowledgable, attentive, and unobtrusive
He helped make the evening even more enjoyable
From the deliciuos crabcakes and mouthwatering cuts of meat, to the wonderfully crafted desserts, the food is superb! I love this place, and will visit again and again!
I never take the time to do these reviews but after reading a horrible and unfair recent review, I had to write
Roth's is by far my favorite restaurant in NY
The exceptional quality of the steaks speaks for itself! The food is succulent! The staff is amazingly knowledgable and friendly and they provide impeccable service! (not to mention the hot blonde waitress and cutie hostess who make the evening always more enjoyable just by existing!!) I would highly recommend this place to anyone, any day!! It's great-- definitely try it!!!
Steaks and side dishes at Roth's were great
However, the level of service we recieved for our large group (a table of 12) was very poor
The waiter was not only snobbish about the entire approach to waiting tables, but also didn't know the basic thing about waiting tables
He took away my friend's plate before he even finished! Plus, he was too busy making out with his girlfriend behind our table that he could not be very attentive to our requests
At the end of the meal, the restaurant even added 20% tip onto our bill without forewarning us in anywhere in the menu
I refused to pay that much for the level of services we received
If you seek an affordable great steak outside of the hustle of many other midtown steakhouses, come up to the Upper West Side to get a taste of Roth's
A cozy neighborhood house, offering live jazz, premium cuts of steak, excellent service, and a personal greet from the owner
who is never too far from his creation
Feel free to start off with the crab cakes, some of the best in the city

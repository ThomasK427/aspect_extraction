Do not recommend especially if someone in your party does not show up
Also they were running out of food in the middle of the night
It was very loud and very crowded
Way overhyped as a restaurant
Can find better choices somewhere else
Stay in Manhattan definitely not worth a trip to Brooklyn and way overpriced for Bklyn
BRB has been getting a lot of good press lately and, although it's a decent restaurant, I don't see what all the fuss is about
The ambience and decor aren't impressive, the food is good but nothing spectacular, and the prices are on par with other NY restaurants serving this type of food
The best part about the place was the service
Where to begin with this letdown? I went to Blue Ribbon with a few friends for Brooklyn Restaurant Week
Once we'd squeezed through the three-deep throng to get to our table, the deafening noise level kept us from hearing the nights' specials
And each other
The prix fixe menu included only 2 choices of entrees: bland, unseasoned cornish hen or dry-as-a-bone beef brisket
Forgettable sides
Forgettable dessert of bread pudding
Note to owner: you need to work on your restaurant week efforts -- we certainly won't come back (and we so wanted to be converts)
Skip this one and go a few doors down in either direction for better food and a better experience


but left raving about other things
Sure, it's overpriced, but I've been here for 8 months and this place has given me the best service out of any place so far
The bartender genuinely seemed to like his job and was gentlemanly (gee, that sounds stupid, doesn't it?) The burger was fine, but I prefer my burgers to drool down my wrist
The oysters were yummy albeit overpriced even for this place
The rib appetizer, though, was superb
Wish the place wasn't so dark, but I left a great tip because I felt the overall experience was how it's supposed to be
The only thing good were the oysters and desert
We had Sea bass and Lobster specials which were highly reccomended by the waiter and were not tasty at all
The lobster was chewy and overcooked, perhaps reheated or sitting around b/c it was cold in some areas
It was not worth it
The sea bass also was boring and so were the side dishes
Overpriced and not tasty, not going back
never sounded so good
I agree with the last poster, except get tank IN Blue - Johnie is one of the best bartenders in Brooklyn
If your a regular the drink will be on the bar right when you walk in
As a compliment to their Manhattan joint, BRB is just as good - maybe better since I dont need a metro card to get there
The fish is all ways fresh and the raw bar is perfect to get the ball rolling - or can even be the whole game
It is definitely one of the best things to happen to Park Slope since the property values started going up
The best way to hit the Blue Ribbon is to get completley tanked at Great Lakes next door, and forget about all your boundaries and limits for money - and hit the raw bar and order as many oysters as you can possibly fit in your stomach
You're going to pay for it in the morning, and in your bank account (and maybe even later that night) - but it's an incredible amount of fun
Decor and ambience is perfect
Staff is always helpful and friendly
Food is excellent - the menu ranges from oysters to steak to fried chicken
My only problem is that the menu is not very large and it has been pretty much the same for the past 3 years that I've been going there
Classyist-Casual restaurant in Park Slope, just a little expensive
So good
Always impressed
The service for starters is always done right
There are plenty of waiters that are all on the same page and insure you have everything you need
The food is also great
Sometimes we'll just get a few appetizers and a bottle of wine, Blue Ribbon does it right
Or maybe just the bread/butter and an entree, you can't go wrong
Or share a huge meal: paella, 54 oz steak, lobster or raw bar specials
Menu highlights: the best french onion soup period, escargots, RAW BAR, shrimp ravioli w/ chevre, any fish dish
I even understand the sushi next door is top notch
It is truly wonderful
My husband and I came here the day of the blackout--it was open and we had walked over the bridge from Manhattan, and had more to go
They had a generator, and we had the raw bar and a great dessert and just a lovely time--and it had been pretty grim before
On Saturday we had the oysters, paella, and roasted endive
The service is terrific and I always feel happy when I leave this restaurant
I think it's a better experience overall than the Manhattan Blue Ribbons, which can be so crowded and loud
I love fresh seafood, especially a good raw bar
Blue Ribbon Brooklyn certainly has it when it comes to freshness
They are open late and there's usually something for everyone on their enormous menu
Definitely a place to try if you are in Park Slope
Perhaps I'm being too stingy, but the prices at this place keep me from being a regular
The food and service are wonderful, as many have said
But the prices are very, very steep
One appetizer, two entrees, two desserts, and one drink a piece cost my husband and I $180 with tax and tip (and we didn't even order the most expensive items from any of the categories!) I wish they'd make their prices just a bit more reasonable
They are out of line with the rest of 5th avenue - even the upscale places
my man has taken me, i have taken my man, our friends have taken us and we have taken our friends to this delight on 5th Ave
the skate is out of this world with it's hidden bacon tid-bits and the appetizers are big enough to enjoy, but not take away from your dinner
the waiters are very hot in their gear and the lighting is key
Great place for special night time ventures
unfortunately, they dont take reservations
Blue Ribbon has pulled ahead of the pack in Park Slope -- even with some of the better newcomers recently
The formula -- Blue Ribbon has great food, a nice comfortable atmosphere and simply the best service perhaps in the city
The staff is welcoming and attentive without being obtrusive
The menu doesn't seem to be all that creative when you read it -- but don't be put off
The food is wonderful and creative
Sunday brunch is especially good
Given the popularity of brunch in the Slope and lack of good places, when is Blue Ribbon going to offer Saturday brunch?
Simply put, this is one of the best restaurants in NYC
The space is comfortable and well designed
The staff is attentive, but not overbearing
The drinks are expertly prepared
And the food is glorious
This is home to great seafood (a raw bar too) and homey comfort foods
Try the shrimp and bacon hash with a perfectly spicy bloody or two, what a brunch should be
Or how about a steak, exactly how you like it? For dessert, the oversized bread pudding can't be beat
It's pricey, yes, but worth every cent
From the day it opened, Blue Ribbon has had a fan in me
It has everything I want from a restaurant
Excellent food and service
I never tire of Blue Ribbon and I hope it is her to stay
This is BY FAR the best restaurnat in Park Slope, if not in Brooklyn
the bar scene is a bit annoying-show-offy, but the dining room is fab, the menu delicious and the service sets a new standard for Brooklyn (service can be VERY sloppy in this neighborhood)
They also are great with kids - Sunday Brunch is a favorite with my family
Highly recoommended
First Date, Last Date or just meeting with friends
The Blue Ribbon will meet your every need

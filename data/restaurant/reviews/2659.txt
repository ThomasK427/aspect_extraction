Once we got there, they had changed the menu, so that the items listed on the site menu were part of the regular menu instead, and therefore were pricier
When we explained that we were there for the NYCS menu listed on the site, the Maitre denied that such menu existed on the site (I came back home to verify and in fact the menu was as I remembered it)
The Maitre did absolutely nothing to honor the advertised offer or try to please us
Unwilling to reward their poor business practices, we left and leave
too bad they charge premium prices
went there for Valentine's Day
you would have thought it was just another Monday, staff was inattentive, had few recommendations, couldn't answer our questions other than reading off the menu, and the food was just OK
Came here for restaurant week lunch
Food took forever to get to us
The waiter looked completely frazzled and couldn't seem to handle his tables well
My sea bass was completely raw inside (no, i didn't order sushi)
Average food, ambience, and bad service
Would not come here again
Although I very much enjoyed my meal at Tropica, it seemed to take forever for everything
My reservation for 2 was during lunch and it seemed that because I was literally 2 minutes late, the hostess felt the need to seat every party before mine
This should have been a clear indicator of exactly how the rest of the service would be
The food was delicious, but it is only a place I would suggest if you have much more than 1 hour for lunch
Halibut was delish; nice wine list; good drinks; good apps
I've eaten here twice and both times, i was not impressed
Food is medicore for a $$$$ restaurant, and service is below par
Waiter placed check on table before we were done eating even though restaurant was not packed
The halibut is dry and untasty
Not worth it unless its on the company card
Decor was plain and grotty
at tropica, the food is fresh and presented carefully and without unnecessary fuss
both of the seared tuna dishes are delicious and each has a subtle asian flavor that heightens the freshness of the fish
the ambience is casual but upscale and the service is attentive without being overbearing
overall, this is a solid midtown choice for seafood and the crowd - especially at the bar - is relaxed and fun
be sure to use a dine out new york certificate for maximum value!
I came here after work not knowing what to expect
The food was GREAT
the drinks were really tasty as well
Convenient location as well
It's restaurant week- so I dutifully made reservations for dinner at Tropica
For appetizer My husband had the shrimp/scallop ceviche that was safe and tasty in a spicy salsa
Mine was calamari salade which was interesting enough with tasty bits of crunchy fried calamari, sugared cashews and mandarin orange slices on a bed of lettuce
Sounds good? well, the decor was tired and the ceiling above us had huge water stains
Our waiter was not personable and horror of horrors-he placed the check on our table while we were still having dessert! I took the check aside and placed it away from our dessert and pretended we didn't just see what had happened
I may expect a check in my face at a diner-maybe, but not at a $$$$ restaurant
Bottomline
Food was good, not great
As for the service, you just may get better from the Olive Garden
Not worth going to unless you are on an expense account
the food was mediocre for the prices they charged
They try to go asian fusion a bit to make it trendy but you might as well get some real asian food for less than 1/2 the price
Good decor but loud bustling with business people in the same building
Was expecting something more funky and exotic (web site listed it as Carribean) but turned out to be a typical high end seafood restaurant not unlike the dozens of other midtown expense account restaurants
Food was uninventive and somewhat boring, but the fish was fresh
Good place to take a client for lunch or dinner
I paid a really good 12$ for this appetizer and 35$ on this lobster entree
it was excellent and exquisitely
DEeeEEeLious
Had a Apple Martini and ended my day
marvelous!!!
The food quality at this place is not as exciting as they would like to think
The service was pleasant, the bread was good, as was the wine
It all comes down to the food at a restaurant, right? This place was just a touch above average
Not worth the prices at all
Although the ingredients were simple, and looked fresh, the taste was just not there
They also suggested a wine, and then returned 10 minutes later informing us they were out of that one
Most likely we will not be returning
My first visit to Tropica was sensational
Food was excellently prepared and delicious and the prices were very reasonable
The Key Lime Pie with Palm Tree cookie was the best I've ever eaten
Even beats the one in Key West
Would definitely return
The Scene This masculine space at the base of Park Avenue caters to a business crowd culled from local office buildings
Although it lacks the patina of places like Peter Luger's and Sparks, it still has a steakhouse's telltale wood paneling, chalkboard specials and decorative wine bottles
The service, although good, can be a bit officious at times
The Food The kitchen caters to culinary hedonists who let their cholesterol be damned in favor of juicy, well-aged steaks, buttery, pan-roasted hash browns and predictably rich creamed spinach
There's also a full raw bar selection, as well as old-school starters like clams oreganata and a middling beef carpaccio
If it's beef you're craving, go for the jugular--in this case, the hugely satisfying porterhouse for two, three or four
Non-meat options, such as the seared tuna, are also nicely executed
This was my first trip to new york and I heard this was a great place to go and get a steak
Boy where we wrong
We showed up at 9:30 and it seemed like every worker was tired of working for the night
From waiting 30 mins for our steaks (By the way there was only 7 other people in the place) and them coming out not to order
My girlfriend's steak was rare compared to medium well (which she ordered)
So get this, our waiter never checked up on us after he brought back my g/f's steak
Both of our steaks were charred and burn't on the top
Then about 20 mins later we see our waiter in street clothes walking out the door
No warning, he just left
Other waiters or other workers are standing there looking for something to do
So finally when another waiter came over to ask if we were done, I complained about the service
Here's bad serivce at its best
He states he will go and talk to the manager, 5 mins later he comes back and says the manager is sorry for the bad service and was willing to give us a free cup of coffee or free dessert
A cup of coffee???? Free Dessert ???? Are you serious
I paid $127 total for my girlfriend and I and all they were willing to do is to give me a cup of free coffee or dessert
If you ever go to New York, don't go to this place it will make you want to go home as fast as you can
For my first steakhouse expirence in New York I may bow never to eat steak again
Ruth Chris's Steakhouse beats this steakhouse by far
Heck this place should not even be cosider a steakhouse
On a scale of 1-10 I give this place a negative 100
After spending 20min looking for it, we finally found it
I liked the atmospher was with some coworkers and we didnt feel intimidated
Waiter was very friendly steaks did need to be checked on often for the Temp
Appetizers a little off on pricage but some are worth it
will go back to give more accurate review
The food was good but for the prices, it was definitely not worth it
For about $20, you get one tiny crab cake for an appetizer

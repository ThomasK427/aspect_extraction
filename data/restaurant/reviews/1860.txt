Every neighborhood deserves a reliable local Japanese restaurant and this is mine
I order from here all the time and am never disappointed
The rolls are packed and the duck appetizer is mouth watering
A great place with value to match
The sushi is so fresh and so reasonably priced, I can't wait to go back!
At first glance, your portions might not look like much, but upon your first taste, you begin to realize you've been snookered by the concept of Bigger is better
Other places boasting larger cuts of fish usually lack the freshness and tender texture of sushi served at Mottsu
Beware the spicy sauce, which can overpower the flavor of the fish
On my first visit, there was no wait, the service was attentive, and reasonably priced
It was an added bonus to sit outside and enjoy our meal on a quiet street without being inundated with noisy people and auto traffic
But inside is nothing to sneeze at, although very clean
Overall, a very pleasant experience
In Short Host Gerard Maurice rules the roost at this rustic French bistro on the eastern fringes of Soho
The simple decor features French doors, a pressed-tin ceiling and a wooden bar heaped with flowers
Out back, a large garden, planted with grape vines and vegetables, allows for dining under the stars
The menu features classic French bistro fare, like steamed mussels with French fries and hangar steak with a green peppercorn sauce
I've lived in NYC my whole life and have seen many restaurants come and go, I've been to great restaurants that are still around but are not quite the same anymore
Le Jardin Bistro is one of the few exceptions
It's a CLASSIC, period! Anyone who knows great French food, exceptional value, quality service and has an appreciation for one of the sexiest dining gardens in the city, should be a regular at this place
If you haven't been, then you're just depriving yourself, and if you have and don't feel the same, then you're either not from NY or you just don't have a clue!
Lovely NYC weather is back and there is no place better to enjoy it then Le Jardin! Weekend brunches and romantic dinners are perfect in the beautiful garden
I am a huge fan of the summer menu's cold Salmon and soft shell crabs
Be sure to make a res as the garden is always packed!
Out of many french restaurants in the city, Jardin is the bistro to go back to
It's unpretentious with a pleasant atmosphere
I find that most small bistros have very similar, plasticky food, but Jardin really sticks out with its delicious, well-priced dishes
I tried a few entrees and each one was served with different vegetables and potatoes
The portions are generous and I love the truffle and port sauce for the filet mignon
I can't think of anything better than a big bowl of mussels, great wine, a summer breeze, and a table in the garden
I was sorely disappointed with the ambience, meal and service
Plastic tables and chairs from Target do not exactly fit my description of romantic outdoor seating
I do not normally post reviews, good or bad, but after our evening at le Jardin I felt compelled to urge others not to make the same mistake I did
the food is very good, authentic and affordable
The Wine list Offers a good variety and service is friendly and efficient, no attitude and no extended waiting time for anything
I was there on a date
My date could not stop raving about the food, she was very impressed and so was I
We had a very nice waiter who helped us pick the wine and did not try and point us in the direction of the most expensive bottle in the house
We found the place to be very romantic and as close to perfect as a small bistro could possibly get
I cant wait to come back in the spring when the back garden opens
LOVE this place! The food is excellent and very authentic French cuisine
Even the desserts are fabulous
My only complaint is that it took about a half hour to receive our check, otherwise the dining experience was pleasant
Definitely sit in the beautiful outdoor garden during the warmer months!
Love this place
Great French food, and apparently, even the french think so! The Brunch menu is even as good as the dinner menu
The atomosphere inside is softly light, while the garden during the summer is unbeatable
And a great looking, professional staff! I'm always there!
The service was terrible! The waiter could not be bothered with anything
We had to constantly ask him for everything
The food was just ok at best
Go someplace else!
This small, unpretentious room and garden serves meals that match its style, simple, casual, homey, delightful
The wait staff enjoy their work, and it shows
The bouillabaisse is the best I have had since a waterfront hole in the wall in Marseille 30 years ago
The Tournedos Rossini sauce is brilliant
The large cadre of regulars having fun add to the ambience
I just love this place
Le Jardin Bistro is a very nice down-to-earth restaurant
I have actually never been in the garden but sitting there is supposed to be even nicer
If you want to have great French food for affordable prices, this place is highly recommended
I'm not big on french food or atmosphere, but this place wasn't too bad
We sat inside because it looked like rain, but if you go, make a reservation for the outside in the back
i cant believe that this is rated as a favorite citysearch outdoor place
i found it dingy [chipped plates, unlit candles, plastic chairs]  the steak frites were no great shakes
cold french fries and fatty steak
our dinner took 1 1/2 hrs to arrive and the staff was less then helpful [not enough silverware, forgot repeated drink orders and 2 salads all together!] alhough apologetic at the end it made for an unpleasant dinner
would unreccommend this place to anyone
A wonderful brunch spot! Great food, service and a beautiful garden dining area
Always a great experience!
The garden is very nice
and you can get lost in the atmosphere but the place is very loud
we sat on plastic chairs and the food was horrible
We had the hanger steak and the duck - both were cooked poorly
The appetizers are very good but not worth ever going back for
The grape leaf covered garden amkes it one of the most romantic and laid-back settings in the city
great meal pleasant atmosphere
had an overall terrific dining experience and would recommend le jardin bistro with enthusiasm
go and sit outside and leave your troubles behind
We chose this place without any info, big mistake
Slow service, they are under the impression that if they tell you that it is slow all is okay, but it wasn;t even busy! Then when the dishes do arrive you wonder why did it take a 40 minutes to make a ham and cheese panini with AMERICAN cheese, American cheese, wow!! Cross the street and try something else or keep walking!
Carpo's has THE best paninis possible! The food is really, really delectable at this delightful cafe on a wonderful corner in the heart of the Village
The foccacia bread is buttery and moist and soft and flavorful and just out of this world! The service is very friendly but a little slow - which is not problematic if you're enjoying hanging out and people watching
Definitely the best cafe of the 4 corners on the block! One tip - the refills are not free and just one small iced tea cost $4
25, so be careful if you're on a tight budget!
Maybe I am a bit biased
I live in the neighborhood and Carpo's is very convenient to me
But every time I bring a friend or a small group of friends to Carpo's Cafe they give it rave reviews as well
The staff is so friendly it's almost funny
I had a Focaccia Sandwich and the bread was so tasty, I asked the waitress where they got it
She smiled, went into the kitchen, and came back with some more for me in a ziplock bag to take home, no charge
She just told me, Don't let my mother see this
In a city where I am used to being treated like garbage to get good food, service like this is a breath of fresh air
Great coffee, great food, great breakfast, great people watching during the day, and great late night snacks or desserts
Simply put, a GREAT place!
There are not words to express how much I love Emerald Planet
I go to NYU so I'm like a 5 minute walk away and I go atleast 2 times a week
They have the BEST salads, and a wide variety of dressings
The workers are friendly and fast, and the food is yummy! They are a bit expensive- around $8 for a chicken salad, but worth every dime!
I just wandered into this hip little shop for the first time a few weeks ago, and I'm hooked! The staff are truly chill and helpful and nice and the food is sooo great
And its cheap! I love the smoothies (even in the winter) and I try a different wrap everytime i go

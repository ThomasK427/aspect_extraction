almost any pasta dish is good and a great value - real quality ingredients and healthy portions
the service is always a bit stiff but typically prompt - they have good timing (don't you hate it when your entree arrives immediately after or, worse, right over top of your appetizer?)
Its also a real nice first date place or fiftieth date place
if you live anywhere near by, and love simple italian, put this place on heavy rotation
oh, and the chicken cutlet special on thursdays is really yummy
here's the deal
- If you hate bright lighting, you'll like this place
- the word for both the food and the space is texture
Nothing is too smooth or too boring
- If you're a foodie you should sit at the bar - designed more for eating than drinking
it's a big old slab of rustic oak, very clean
here you can watch your meal be prepared over a high heat gas range
- Food: excellent
I've only eaten here once; the bread is delicious - warm, rustic, bread charred on the outside served with oil and olives
The salad (beet) was fresh - simple - needed more cheese
My girlfriend ordered the best gnocci i've ever tased
I ordered the tuna (medium rare) which was close to rare in the center - perfect
Impressively thick cut, served in a dark tomato sauce (I think with beans); intense
I believe this restaurant to be a great find
The food is fresh and authentic Italian and the portions are great for the price
The service is fine considering that Supper will not break the bank and will likely impress you
Leave about a 1/2 hour of wait time in on a weekend night and ask your server to recommend the wine
Our waiter had poor service and was rude during our stay
We tipped according to our experience
He then came out of the place and confronted us asking why
Wow what class, if you would be more plesant maybe you would get a better tip
I would never go back with such an obnoxious waiter
We were a party of 4 and had to wait maybe 30 minutes for a table
We sat in the wine bar and the bartender was very versed in the wine list and helped us pick out a moderately priced wine
We enjoyed it so much we ordered another with dinner
Our waitress once seated was patient and didn't rush us and made several suggestions
Maybe we had such a good experience since it was later in the evening on a Sunday night which isn't usually a really busy time
We were seated at our own private booth which had views into the open kitchen
A regular cross town haunt for me due to the value it offers in a great friendly environment
I've not had too many problems geting a table and the staff have always been really helpful in getting us from the next door bar or phoning us when the table's ready
Only one complaint - the specials list - it's far too long and only on my last visit did they have it written down (it doesn't seem to change too much)
This restaurant is sectioned into two parts: a waiting/bar area and a restaurant side
While you're waiting, you can grab something to drink in the bar
The appetizers were delicious! We had pate, salmon, and salad
The dishes were also tasty
I love this place, my fiance and i come here regularly and have honestly never been dissappointed
The food is consistently very good, service is fine for a busy restaurant and the price is right
I really like the reasonably priced wine list
The music is always on point too
mmmmmm
I've been to Supper several times and each time has been great
The daily specials are always very tempting and the appetizers are great especially the mushroom trifolati
The service is generally very good although be warned they don't take reservations and on Friday and Saturday nights it can get pretty crowded
Also most of the tables are communal so get ready to get chummy with the neighbors
Supper looks like an intimate Italian restaurant for couples on the outside; but when you enter, be forewarned that you will not be seated at an individual table unless you are a party of 3+
The waiter was pretty anxious to get us in-and-out, although there were ample tables and my friend and I opted to sit at the bar
If you go to Supper, sit at the bar since that's where the action is
The predominantly Latin American kitchen staff put on quite a show- which makes up for the drama queen wait staff
The food was affordable and tasty
I'd suggest trying it once
We were @ Supper on Friday night with a group of nine
We waited in the bar area and had an excellent time waiting for dinner with the bartender and staff
We waited about an hour, which was quicker than we were told, and were seated downstairs next to the wine cellar
The atmosphere was perfect for our group and we enjoyed the group seated next to us
We shared many of the appetizers and entrees and everyone was extremely pleased
Following dinner we headed back up to the bar and had an awesome evening with the extremely fun and friendly staff
Totally recommend an evening @ Supper!!
I read all the bad reviews
and i don't get it! I have been to many restaurants in the city
I am in the business and my fiancee and I are trying to open our own
We had dinner at Supper and were really happy with everything from the open kitchen(try sitting at the bar if you can
you can watch everything they do from making tomorrow's stock to sauteeing your veal) to the big portions to the laid back service and good prices
If you want classic French cuisine and four star formal treatment, then go to Daniel
If you want rustic quality food with sufficient service, go to Supper
I'm a little perturbed at the misleading reviews on this thing
seems knd of like a prank
We came here hearing it was a hip spot with a reasonable price and yummy food
Waited an hour and a half in the wine bar (wine bar was great)
Although we put our name on the list for 5 they seated us at a table for 4
I was brought a dish that I did not order and then asked if I minded eating this instead since they had already made it by mistake
Whats worse is that they charged us for the mistake
Just dont get it
after hearing raves about this place for sometime
i went with my party of six and waited for an hour and half in anticipation of some very yummy yet reasonable dishes
Incredibly disappointed
The food was average at best and you can get the same at any cheapy mediocre italian in the city
This place, along with Frank, is a typical overrated, overhyped trendy place that serves bored italian food by bored looking waitstaff
Why bother when there are so many better, cheaper restaurants in the city
I love Supper! In a city with expensive, over rated dining, this place is a gem! The food is great and the prices are even better
Try the bread salad
I forget the correct name
it's excellent! If you have to wait, the wine bar is a great experience
The bartender was fabulous, and not snobby, like many other wine experts
This is definitely one of my favorite bang for the buck restaurants in NYC
I was here recently with 6 others: BAR: The bartender was EXCELLENT--extremely knowledgeable and friendly (unfortunately, I can't remember her name)
She let us taste several wines AND BEERS before choosing
DINNER: service was acceptable and the food good (not superb, but decent)
The atmosphere was great
My only complaint is that the waiter added a 20% tip to bill (despite there being no mention of this on the menu, etc
,), didn't tell us about it (hoping it'd slip past us as it sometimes happens in big parties)
And 20%? That's a little high for an automatic tip--I suppose he thought 7 women wouldn't tip well but oh well, its his loss--these 7 women make very decent money and never tip less than 25%
If I went back, I'd have dinner in the bar--better service and even better atmosphere
After reading some of the reviews on here, I must say I was pleasantly surprised
This place had some of the best Risotto I've ever had AND the waitress was very friendly and attentive! We were curious how they described us on the board, but unfortunatley by the time we got to looking we weren't on it anymore
some of the descriptions were mildly funny, but nothing I'd consider insulting

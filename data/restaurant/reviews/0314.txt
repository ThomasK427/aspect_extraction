You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place
Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service
Delivery is fast too
Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi
A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite
The editorial review led me to believe this would be a fun/happening dinner spot, but that wasn't exactly true
While the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either)
The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal
The decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening
So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out
The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud
she will kick you out of the restaurant if you not finish your meals within an hours
that's what me and my friends going through when we go to mizu
The sushi here is soooo yum
The crystal roll is particular good and the sashmi is also great
This place is also fun for groups!
food is wonderful and well priced
service is great
everything is great
I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much
and we're repeat customers
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there
Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll

it's delicious!
Well first of all, u can find this kinda sushi even in queens with much better deal in price
Mizu tried to make bigger sushi but bigger not always better! They tend to fall apart before we eat them
And the not so good english spoken-management even dissapointed my guest that I brought few night ago
Servers are NOT patient, NOT professionally trained when handling questions and are NOT well-knowledge about the foods
In result, they misleaded our orders
Place is too noisy, too small and NOT Air Conditioned
which is unbelieveable
Basically not comfortable at all!  So dissapointed
and will never come back!!
I have been here so many times and each time the sushi is fresh and the staff is polite and quick
Excellent ambiance and a great reasonable $ choice for lunch or dinner
I love Mizu
I liked it when it first opened and it was quiet and cozy
I stopped going for a while when it became a haven for the bridge and tunnel crowd enjoying their first beers and saki drops
The place has quieted down and I love it again
EXCEPT IN THE SUMMERTIME
Service is great! The waitress even knows our names! But I have one big time negative
It is hot in the summer in NYC and Mizu has no A/C! It is unfortunately too hot to sit in in the summertime, and too bad
I will probably not come back until winter
If I want no a/c I can stay in my loft! Great food, great service, great now the bridge and tunnel crowd are gone, but needs too cool off in the summer
My husband and I have been to Mizu many times and are always impressed
The tuna is superb!! Our favorites are the Crazy and Electric rolls
The sushi is priced fair, the portion size is great, the service wonderful and the fish always fresh and delicious
Our all-around favorite sushi place!
I've been to the best sushi restaurants in the city, Bond Street, Nobu, blah blah blah
Mizu is THE BEST! It's inexensive, has innovative rolls that I haven't seen anywhere else and attentive service
On a weekend, you need a reservation
All I have to say is make reservations
It's the place to be
The food is amazing, the staff are great, and I always find parking
You may not be as lucky as I when it comes to the latter, but that should not hinder your experience
INCREDIBLE!!! I hate to even write about this unbelievable place (for fear of even more crowds) as they still accept reservation and the food is outstanding!!! The Yuki and Crystal rolls are the best in the city!!! This place is the best hidden treasure for the freshest quality, tastiest and most value for the price!!!
Went here for dinner on my birthday before going out with a small group of friends
Had an amazing time thanks to Joe, the manager
He came around to make sure we were having a good time, and even had a shot of sake with us
The food was great and the prices are very reasonable
I mean, this isn't Bond St
or Nobu, but you're not shelling out $100 - $150 for dinner
The ambience is great, the food is great, great staff and a really cool atmosphere
One thing would be to get there early, or make reservations
this is a very popular place later in the week
I don't know why some people think that the sushi here is good
I've had much better for a lower price (try Little Tokyo in the Village or even some places in Brooklyn)
It is just ok and for what you get, is not inexpensive
sushi was good; however the friday night i went it was full of bridge and tunnel people; i
e
guidos from brooklyn and queens
Don't go if you want a serene environment to go with your sushi
This is the best place to eat sushi
They are generous wwith the food, and their Shrimp Tempura Roll is incredible!
I strongly reccomend hitting this place up
They've got some of the freshest sushi that's served like artwork by trained pros
Sit at the bar and have Paul hook it up
King Salmon all the way
If you don't want to wait in line and you want nice atmosphere and really good sushi, this is your place
Although I am a fan of Yama and Monster Sushi, it was nice to actually dine at Japanese restaurant for a change, instead of being caught up in chaos
It really is a hidden gem that most don't know about, but I am willing to let in on this Flatiron secret
Two thumbs up!
The food is nothing to get excited over but the quantity is considering this is a japanese restaurant in New York City
They serve large portions and the foods quality is satisfactory
Decor is casual but has a little new york city flare to it
The manager is a friendly and a drinker, he comes by every so often to drink with the customers which makes people feel like he's known you for years
I'd visit this place again
I love to eat at Sushi Samba when I go to the Grammacy Park area, but a couple of weeks ago the line was so long, I went around the corner and tried Mizu Sushi
I am not a Sushi expert, but the food at Mizu tasted as good as many of the more expensive Sushi joints I have been to
The fish was very fresh
But what made Mizu standout, and my girlfriend noticed the same thing was the service
The wait staff was very friendly and gave good service
I have been back several times with both my girl friend and friends and the wait staff has always been top notch
I must say Jamey and Roy were great servers and the manager was very friendly too
Mizu is similar to Yama but has a little more ambiance and better service
The fish was good but not overwhelming
Very attentive service and very good value for money
Large fresh portions of fish and attentive and friendly staff
Must try the spicy maki combo

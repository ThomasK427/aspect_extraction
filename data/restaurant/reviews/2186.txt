Wait staff was on top of it
food was very good offering standard italian dishes mixed in with new italian fare and many spanish classics
We chose to stay with the italian food which hit the spot but was just better than average for manhattan
The service was friendly and attentive without being pushy and rushed
My boyfriend and I stopped in by chance after attending a show at the Radio City Music Hall
The food was spectacular
I had the Penne Artista, which was fantastic
My boyfriend had the Seafood spaghetti
We ate every last bight and were so pleased with the delicious food
We arrived late so there was a small group of people left sipping wine and sangria and nibbling on desert
It had a family feel and we felt as if we belonged there
Our waiter was very helpful and responsive to us
There was also another waiter / musician playing guitar and stopping to play for individual tables
Simply put the experience was delicious and delightful
We highly recommended San Martins for both local NYers and visitors who are searching for good food at a very reasonable price
Only one word for this place is SLOW
A group of us went for drinks after dinner but it took forever to get served
It is a very small place, so you would expect superior service
The bar itself is very inviting with warm rich colours and great seating for groups just to hang out
This is a must do
World renowned chefs have come to make uniwue dishes from their region of spain
Absolutely fabulous
This only lasts for 1 month each year
We had serrano ham appetizer, asparagus dish, which i cant pronounce and a great white bean soup
The roast suckling pig was delicious as was the punch cake
The service was great and the chef came out to meet everyone
Definately come during the week when its not as busy
While trying to maintain a budget on our stay in Manhattan, we found the price of meals to be astonomical! On our first day in NYC, my daughter and I were dismayed to find we spent over $30 for cheeseburgers and sodas at lunch and $90 for 1 steak and 1 pasta dinner with 1 drink apiece
On our second night, after having spent $11 for 2 slices of pizza for lunch, we were headed for dinner before a Broadway show
As our taxi headed down E
47th towards Times Square, my daughter spied Connolly's Restaurant's sandwich sign advertising a surf turf dinner for only $17!!  Our cab dropped us off at the corner of 47th and Broadway, we planned to go to Planet Hollywood, knowing full well that we'd be paying an exhorbitant price for a so-so meal
Fortunately for us, some celebrity was there and the crowd was about 50 deep all around the restaurant
We decided to keep on walking down the block, back to Connolly's
What a treat!!! We were seated downstairs in a beautifully wood paneled room
I ordered the surf turf, and my daughter ordered chicken parmesan
Both entrees were under $20 and were excellent! The surf turf consisted of a good sized, tender and flavorful piece of steak with three large shrimp scampi, a baked potato, and some nice, crisp fresh green beans
My daughter raved about her chicken parmesan, 2 large freshly breaded crispy chicken cutlets served over a bed of spaghetti covered in a delicious marinara sauce
My only complaint about the meal was the lack of bread or rolls served, even though there were bread plates on the table when we were seated
The service was wonderfully attentive, and our requests for more sauce and butter were met in a timely manner and with a smile! (Something I found woefully lacking in the other restaurants we visited
)  All in all, I would very highly recommend Connolly's to fellow tourists who are looking for a great meal that won't break the vacation budget!!
i wouldnt recommend this for a real meal
the pastas are ill prepared, and the server couldn't look us in the eye, for some reason
one plus, the appetizer of the day is often affordable ($6) and can serve as a lunch
i'm sure this spot is far better for the beerseeking crowd
definitely shouldn't market itself as a *restaurant*
Great restaurant a great atmosphere for entertaining a client taking a date
The food is decent, and everything is well priced
Ive been in this location when it was both busy and not Ive always had a great time!
Not a bad place, and it certainly is reasonably priced
Only had drinks there, but it seems to be a blue-shirted sausage party on friday evenings
Definitely has a cool atmosphere, but it's a bit clique-y
I enjoyed their homey atmosphere, friendly people
Best deal in town, especially in the theatre district
The food is fantastic and portions are plentiful and the price is very reasonable
Especially like their burgers and no one can beat their Shepherd's Pie among many other favorites
We came here for a quick breakfast and left very happy
The waffles were better than the ones at Norma's at one third the price
The pancakes were also quite good
The service is very plain, but that can be expected of a diner
The prices were reasonable
I would definitely come back if I am in the neighborhood
The Imagination burger is probably the best burger I've ever had
Fries aren't great, and the mac n' cheese is so-so
Service gets crappy in the lunch time rush, and some dishes are very pricey
Would NOT recommend the desserts
average diner food
They like to rush you in and out so the Comfort Diner name is a bit misleading
Do try the milkshakes - not bad
Stick with the breakfast food - it's hard to go wrong
This is listed in the book NY's 50 Best Brunch Places so my boyfriend and I tried it
it was so not worthy of being on that list!!! The place is old and dirty and disgusting and the food was not that good at all
I could get a better omellete at a local deli
The only thing that was good about our meal was the chocolate fugdge/peanut butter milkshake
I would not recommend this filthy place to anyone!!! There are so many other places to get an awesome brunch at in NYC
like Annie's on the UES!!! Or Vinyl on the UWS!
I have frequented this diner before but was horrified today when my friend and I were actually asked to leave because they needed our booth
Granted, this place does at times get overly crowded but today was not one of those days
The food is good but when you can't even finish your iced tea -- who needs it! By the way, we weren't even there for one hour before we were asked to leave!
It's a quickie mid-town grab 'n go chinese restaurant that'll give you exactly what you expect
Greasy, but good, cheap chinese food
A more than filling meal will run you around $5-6
It's tasty, it's cheap, it's fast
For what it's worth, it's pretty decent
This place is absolutely amazing! I can't find this price for this value any where else in the city
The people who work there are wonderful - i came in about 7pm from work one day, and as many many many New Yorkers are, completely exhausted
Anyway, I looked at the sushi selection, didn't find exactly what I wanted so the owner made my order to my liking right there on the spot! Anyway, I'm extremely impressed with this place! Their prices are much better than most take-out sushi - $2
99 - $7
99 -depending on what you want
other place range from $5
50 to $10 and up
My point is that their selection, quality, service, and value are definitely worth the extra walk!
I've been eating at this place since 2002, and LOVE it
I swear the 46th St location has secret fravor in that teriyaki source, becuase other Teriyakiboy location I taste the difference
Try Tokyo Fried Chiken, all teriyaki dish, and tempra
I used to eat there two meals a day until my company moved to stupid Madison avenue (UGH, nasty food for rip off tourist price!) I still order every week from 46th st TB
The owner is da Man!  If you are one of those stereo-typed people who thinks good Japanese good can be made by Japanese people only, then take your money somewhere else
This is truely a great place to enjoy Japanese fast food for less
with the exception of one waitress, service is okay
one of the best chinese food in the city if you like spicy
their chicken with garlic sauce is second to none and their fried rice and soups are all great

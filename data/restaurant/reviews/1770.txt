Taco Bell? The margarita tasted like kool aid
The rest was ok but not great
I was expecting a diamond in the rough
The ingredients were fresh, generous and reasonably tasty but the best
no way! I would characterize the food as good for inexpensive fare but not worthy of the praise in other reviews
Not bad but head to Mexicana Mama for the best
top three mexican restaurant in the city
and I have been to them all
the service will blow you away
guacamole made right at the table and make sure you get the cucaracha shots
if you want a legit authentic place where people all know how to have fun this is your spot- and make sure you get to know chito
This is my first time posting a review on Citysearch
Normally, nothing affects me enough to put in the effort
until a few nights ago
My husband and I eat Mexican food at least a couple of times a week and we always like to try different places
We went to Blue Moon and we will NEVER go back
The first problem was that the air conditioner was not working - we should have left then
But we were excited to have our margaritas on that hot summer evening
They were just badly made
We asked to trade our frozen margaritas for on the rocks, but they were no good either
They had no taste, like bland watered down lemonade
Dissapointed, we decided just to switch to bottled beer
We both ordered enchiladas which is one of our favorite mexican meals to get
It was absolutely disgusting
After about 1 minute the cheese on my enchilada got hard
The chicken was so dry that I couldn't bear to swallow more than 2 mouthfuls
My husband said his chicken tasted like very dry turkey?!? I decided just to eat the rice beans b/c how can you get rice beans wrong??? The black beans were so watery and the rice so dry
I just had this gut instinct that this meal had been made in a microwave
I called the waiter over to take away my plate b/c I was getting nauseous just having the plate in front of me
I just have to say that I have sent food back just ONE other time in my life, maybe 8 years ago - I am not that picky
That may tell you how terrible this food was
We didn't complain too much to the waiter b/c it was obviously not his fault
We just decided to finish our beers and write it off as a learning experience
I do have to end this by saying the wait staff was absolutely perfect and very nice
Our waiter ended up taking the meals off our bill - honestly, he was so quick not to charge us for the food that it almost felt like it was something he has to do often
we went for sunday brunch with the unlimited champagne/mimosa options
the food was fantastic and the service could not hvae been better
the food was tastey and authentic mexican food, great flavour, great presentation and the drinks kept coming, everytime a glass was empty they refilled immediately
would go back, time and time again
I moved out to California 2 years ago from the East Coast
and heard about how awesome the Mexican food was here
I thought that was true until I visited the Blue Moon again
California food and for that matter the actual food in Cabo is bland and average compared to the dishes at this cafe
The service was great and the manager Carlos is one of the nicest guys you will ever
So if you want great Mexican food that wont hurt your wallet and want to make some new friends come buy and see Carlos and his friendly staff
you will not be disappointed
I went here with several friends for the unlimited mimosa brunch recently
Kudos to the bartender, but the chef(s)/cook(s) need some serious help
No one in my party finished their meal and everyone pretty much hated it
We stumbled upon the Blue Moon this summer while we were looking for a place to have brunch on a Saturday
Two words: unlimited mimosas
The huevos rancheros were awesome as well as the perfectly fried chorizo
The guacamole could use a little more cilantro, but it was fantastic, especially the amount they give you
We're going back this weekend and this time with friends to get an early buzz and a great brunch!
Food was not bad
It was not special but I will say more than average
But, we waited too long until all food served
Our apptizer severed after 40mins after we seated and main dish came other 20mins
We almost waited 1hrs to get main dish and I do not think it is worth
Obviously we did not get right service and nobody said soory for that and other restaurant guests who came after us got quicker dish than us
I was very patient and I do not want to be nasty about it
I can say it not gonna happen all the same but they did not do right things that they have to do
Of course, I just left little money for tip and I do not think I will come back there again
There are lots of other mexcian places that they can do better than this place
With so many overpriced restaurants in Chelsea, folks now are willing to pay anything for just mediocre food, but the Blue Moon is the exception to the rule in this neighborhood
As reliable as you will get, one can never go wrong here with a stop into this establishment at any time of the day or day of the week
There are plenty of fruity frozen beverages and enough choices of delicious food to satisfy anyone's taste (from chicken sandwich to chicken salad, to burritos)
This place is the best find in town! The food is amazing-- real grilled steak! The margaritas are made from scratch and will knock your socks off for only $8! I highly recommend the combo fajitas, the worldwide burritos are enough for two meals and the nachos are out of this world! Don't walk
RUN!
The Blue Moon has been my favorite Mexican Restaurant for over 17 years
that in itself should say something
Very few places in the city have this kind of longevity
The food is amazing and delicious - the portions are so huge I always go home with lunch the next day
They make their Margaritas from scratch - not from some lame machine and they use blue salt
The staff is always friendly and helpful and I feel welcome from the moment I step in the door
I would recommend giving the Blue Moon a try - my friends and family all love it
Good local place to have an ENORMOUS plate of food and some salty margaritas for a decent price
It's not the best mexican food in the city
It is, however, a good Friday night i don't know, what do you feel like eating type place
Great food and service, and I actually very much enjoyed my margaritas
The other reviewer didn't seem to like them, but he must have had a bad night
The burritos are great and the people fun
The Scene A cool Mediterranean retreat from the city's chaos, with fabric-swathed ceilings and pristine white furnishings
Even on a hectic night, service is calm and competent, and the professional couples at most of the tables seem to be speaking in peaceful whispers
The Food The kitchen offers scintillating versions of hearty, refreshing Greek favorites
Souvlaki is charcoal-grilled and upscaled with filet mignon to produce an impressively tender, succulent result
Wine-marinated octopus legs are also charcoal-grilled, resulting in astounding flavor and not a hint of rubberiness
Classics like garlicky skordalia, fava beans, sauteed chicken livers over lentils, and spanakopita are all best-of-breed versions, the latter prepared as a platter of bite-sized pies
A sizeable portion of moussaka, consisting of layers of juicy ground lamb and eggplant, tied together by a superlative bechamel
For dessert, the array of delicate pastries and the deeply creamy rice pudding are excellent without exception
I would never have found this place
but I search on Citysearch by location
tried it and loved it
every bit was awesome
the service was a little lack
but we forgave it
make sure to sit in the skylight area!
I agree with some of the other reviews
I've lived in NYC for 8 years, the food was among the best I've had off the main menu, the fish was exceptionally prepared and the service was among the best I've had at any restaurant
Prices were a little high for a neighborhood place (especially the wine) with average decor

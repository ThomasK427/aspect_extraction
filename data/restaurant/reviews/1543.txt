I don't know how they do it but I'm coming back
We went to brunch here on a recommedation
We had a bit of a wait but with the reasonable prices at the bar, it was no big deal
Food was great, hostess and waitress were super friendly! We made a day of it!
I cannot figure out why on a Saturday, a restaurant would run out of its edamame, filet mignon, and a slew of other items on the limited menu
I guess it was because it was 8:30 at night and they weren't expecting anyone else to show up for dinner! From the boring bread to start, we knew that staying longer than necessary would be not worth it
I had the chicken, which, I could have microwaved better myself, and the filet mignon (which was a ny strip at filet mignon prices) was tepid warm at best
This place has potenitial but needs serious revamping of its operations to be at the very minimum a decent restaurant
While the LES bar/lounge explosion is nothing new, something this good certainly is
Tucked among some of the worst NYC has to offer, Essex has an impressive upscale feel, good drinks and food, and good music on the weekends
With some of the great eats on Clinton St
, this neighborhood is becoming one of the best in the city
Everything about this place is sub-par, if you think otherwise you really need to get out more
I went for an MTV VMA promotion wherein entrees were supposed to be $8
28
When I arrived, turned out only 2 entrees on the menu were included
The waitstaff was rude and imbecilic and our waiter didn't know what several words on the menu meant
We waited a full hour for our mediocre food which was well done despite my requests otherwise
Not only was the food and service bad but the staff didn't even seem sorry, they just seemed pissy and bored
The staff tried to make me feel guilty! If you don't want to participate in the promotion, fine, but if you do, don't act like a jerk and serve mediocre food
And as for going for the scene, don't bother, there isn't any to speak of
I was searching for the perfect spot in New York to host my party, and definitely found it with Essex! The food, the staff, the atmosphere, the location - everything about this place rocks! :)
I've been here a couple of times when bouncing around orchard
some nites it's dead and others it's alright
Try to get away from the bar area and grab a waiter in the back, you'll get served faster
Four of us went for brunch on Sunday
You can't find a better deal in town
$12 per person including unlimited drinks
The food was decent enough that you can't complain
The only thing I will comment on is the hostess and the wait
We had a reservation and 2 of us showed up on time and notified the hostess that we were there but the other 2 were running a few minutes late
A few minutes turned into about 10-15 minutes and the hostess gave our table away to another party
When our party was complete, we had to wait an additional half hour because she gave our table to some mohawked folk
Essex is nicest looking spot in area with consistantly good food and down-to-earth servers, especially the Friday night bartender who remembered my drink even though I hadn't been there for in months
And the Friday night DJ rocked! I will definitely be back sooner
The food is pretty good
Went to dinner twice there, both on weeknights
It was pretty empty
But the food is satisfying
No complaints
My friends and I go here often on Wednesday nights for its lobster special and the Sunday all-you-can drink brunch
The food is tasty, the service is chill and the prices can't be beat
The regular menu is a little pricey for the hood but the large booths and the atmosphere make a favorite for friends from out of town
My wife and I had a truly special dinner at Essex this tuesday
We live in the neighborhood and while we have always found the food adequate to good, we were quite excited when we found out that the Chef from Casanis, a long lost East Village favorite, had taken over the kitchen, and he did not disappoint
The lobster tail over lobster and seaweed risotto that was spectacular as was the herb crusted lamb chops and fried oysters on the half-shell
The Dessert menu seemed to be an afterthought, but the chocolate mousse cake was quite yummy
Overall, Dinner at Essex brought back the good old days at Casanis, without the cramped tables
service is a little slow last night when i went with a group of friends
it's a wednesday night and it was very quiet
the wait staff was great, but the kitchen was a little slow
but the food is very good, especially for the value
wednesday night special is a small lobster with 2 sides
for 14 dollars only
you can get a second lobster for $8
what a steal
although it was quiet last night, but you can easily tell the ambience will be perfect for a pack friday or saturday night
Went for New Year's Eve Dinner with 15 friends and was blown away
The place was packed, but once we got past the bar area, we were seated at a roomy table with bottles of champagne iced and ready to go
The five course meal for $85 with champagne was a steal: Oysters with caviar, foie gras, herb-crusted lamb and a porcini and polenta soup that was one of the best soups I ever had
Service was prompt, although at times the waiters seemed to be spending more time dealing with the overflow from the bar than the diners (ever heard of cocktail waiters)
If the regular food is anything like the New Year's Menu then Essex has my vote
Brunch at Essex is likely a weekly party with good food and (almost) free drinks
The crowd is mostly hipsters and Euros hugeing it up on unlimited bloodies
The staff is sexy and pretty quick considering how packed it is
The eggs benedict with lox is top notch
My freinds and I make Saturday Brunch our first stop to get the party started quickly
the food is OK and they need new entrees in their menu
however nothing beats the endless drinks though
the waitresses are attentive however the guy who cleans the tables has an attitude like he owns the place and definitely needs to be fired
I hadn't been to Essex since I moved uptown and I was quite surprised and a little worried when I saw the crowds for their Saturday Brunch Special
The reviewer below must have had the wrong waiter, because while I did have to wait about 15 minutes for a table, our server was fabulous, the bloody's were as spicy good as always, and the gravlax and whitefish platter tasted like it should have cost three times as much
The only thing that we needed was a high-chair for our son, though at these prices we can afford a babysitter!!
When I found this little wonder I was deceived
Somewhat hidden in the lower east side, this place had niceand hip decor, I felt as though I might have found a jewel in my neighborhood
The novelty wore down quick
We sat down and waited
and waited
you get the point
The waitstaff seemed to be auditioning for Dazed and Confused
Sometimes in New York I write off the service because the food more than makes up for it
Not the case with Essex
The brunch menu lures in those looking for the cocktail-hangover-cure with their endless mimosas and bloody-marys
I think the main motivation is to get the customer drunk enough where the service and food will be forgotten
But how can one forget wasted time in this time-sucking city? THIS was a wasted Sunday, and I wish I had gotten wasted elsewhere
WOW! I am SHOCKED this restaurant has received such rave reviews from people
Our brunch was RUINED by the horrible staff at this place
Basically, the volume of people attracted by the free Sunday booze makes service here impossible
I would rather buy my drinks than deal with the horrible wait for a table and rude staff
When I asked why EVERYTHING was taking so long, the waitress actually responded with the title of this article
She said, exasperated, Welcome to Brunch at Essex
Apparently this restaurant heyday is over
too many people and too poor of a manager
Avoid it
The advertised unlimited mimosas and bloody marys is too good to be true until you realize that they keep down your drink count because the service is so slow
They are quite tasty, as well as the food, but the unattentive service made it all hard to enjoy
For example, the busboy gave me a dirty look when I asked for a spoon and sugar for my coffee, and by the time he brought it around, I could've been drinking iced coffee
Treated myself to brunch at Essex on a recent Saturday morning
I loved it! Very unique and  delicious food
I chose something I normally  wouldn't cook for myself - Potato pancakes with a sweet yellow cream sauce and apples, and  a really delicious hash of spinach, black beans and shitake mushrooms on the side

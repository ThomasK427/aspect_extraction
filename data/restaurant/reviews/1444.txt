The fact that Porcao is in Gramercy also helps vs
Plataforma's theater district/ tourist/ business central location
The pros: very friendly service, fantastic meats, hip atmosphere
The cons: unsavory salad bar and sides, and limited wine list
You must love red meat to eat there, others would be happier at Plataforma
While I can absolutely praise the friendly service, the food, unfortunately, is merely average
The salad bar is also quite limited
While one can enjoy an average meal at Porcao, the $70 per person price tag makes it unworthy
I've been to Porcao in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the food there was amazing for a fraction of the price
I guess they just haven't managed to bring over the recipes to the US
attentive service and food was good, but salad bar needs more improvement
This place's decor can be redone, but the food is what counts
The steaks were great and the service was so good it was sometimes scary, ie the waiter caught my spoon before it hit the floor
Everyone wears a microphone so while the waiter is at the table, he is radioing someone to fix whatever you need
Apparently they have other places in Rio and Miami that are also amazing
Sicilians are tough to deal with in general and even harder to please with a good meal but this authentic Sicilian restaurant satisifes even the most ardent complainer
We tried the rabbit, lamb and pasta al forno as well as many of the apps, very happy
cool decor
Theres a trend among Italian restaurants about freshness of ingredients and adherence to true country Italian, regardless if tastes are unfamiliar to Americans
This isnt bad news
Lupa is packed adhering to this delicious formula
Dani seems like it may be trying to be a West-of-So-Ho Lupa
Ingredients are so fresh, execution so country Italian, you wonder where they got this wonderful idea
Salad of bitter greens and raw artichoke doesnt bowl you over but its like they picked the ingredients from the garden this morning
Bucatini with sardines, pine nuts and golden raisins is not the kind of dish most Americans would call Italian, but was memorable
Rabbit cacciatore over soft polenta was so beautifully done I wonder how the chef can top it
The wine list is on the expensive side, but the Italian entries are fascinating
Try the refosco
Dani should be destined for hard-to-get-into status
had dinner at dani with friends on a busy saturday night, room was full of people that seemed to be having a great time
i ordered the tuna carpaccio which was topped with blood oranges and was bursting with flavor, tried the special entree which was stribed bass that was delicious, finished with the chocolate cake which is amazing
service was extremely friendly and attentive and to top it off chef pintabona personally stopped by and introduced himself
loved the space a very cool downtown look, can't wait to go back, overall an amazing experience!
I was very excited about trying this new place but i was highly disappointed
The service was horrible- the 'manager' took my our order - did not write it down- and two of us were given the wrong apps and or entrees
On top of that the waiter kept referring to my daughter as 'sweetie'- hightly inappropriate
The food was great- but we also waited 20 minutes at the bar before the batender 'Natalia' noticed us
These people have a great restaurant but the wait staff was horrible
The food was excellent! I went there and had a great night, great food and great ambience
It was a great experience and I highly recommend the Chicpea Fried Calamari with Cracked Pepper Lemon Aioli! Everything was so fresh and I can't say anything negative
Gre
perfection!  Our experience at Dani was amazing; the dishes and the ambiance left us feeling as though we were in Sicily
You know its great food when you reminisce about it days later!!! A charming and romantic restaurant
There's a new Don of Italian cuisine
Chef Pintabona's Sicilian twist on some Italian favorites will make your mouth water
The octopus and calamari were excellent, the bucatini with sardines, cooked to perfection, and the white bean soup with escarole drives away the winter chill
Entrees like a tagine of cod with couscous and raisins pulls from Sicily's African influence and the pork cutlet melts in your mouth
The grilled swordfish was succulent as was the homemade fennel sausage
Dani's well-chosen winelist is a wonderful complement to its menu
The restaurant is beautiful
A warm amber glow from inside is accented by light streaming through the textured glass windows that surround the entire restaurant
The perfect Greek taverna experience to relive those memories of Athens and beyond
Try the grilled octopus for starters and the main dish of grilled calamari is as good as it gets
Simple, inexpensive, warm and friendly, just like you remember Greece
Been there three times and each time had a different meal all excellent
You can even make a meal by just having appitizers
Friendly service
Recommed to all
Opened 3 blocks from my house - went 3 times in the first week! Grilled octopus, calamari, musaka, all a must
Great salads and the dessert (which is COMPLIMENTARY) is so rich and delicious
friendly service - a little slow when it gets packed (which happens often)
The crowd is completly mixed; families; couples; teenagers - I recognized all the local Greek business owners and their families dining there; which I think is a great compliment to the cooking! Worth every minute you have to wait and every penny you spend
First of all, the name of the restaurant is Agnanti, NOT Asnanti
Second, I don't know what restaurant this Tina Frank person went to, but it's not this one
This one didn't have the pork dish Tina claims to have disliked
It's a lovely place without outdoor seating and amazingly delicious food
We shared many plates of appetizers and each one was delectable
Try the zucchini croquettes, they're amazing! We also had stuffed grape leaves with salmon, chicken boreck, and fried baccala
The marinated eggplant is also delicious
With an ice cold carafe of wine, we had a wonderful evening
My main course arrived, and it was supposed to be pork souvlaki with fries
What I got was barely 1/4 lb of PORK FAT SHAVINGS from the bottom scrapings of a fry grill and hideously greasy fries
Sent it back, GOT THE SAME THING
Gave the waitress a $10 tip and promptly left
ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMENDED
dont' let the Zagat raves in the window fool you! So many other great places in Astoria
THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM
I'm so happy to see all the good reviews Baci Abracci is getting - they deserve them all, and then some
I went here for the first time the night after opening night and I've been back probably eight or nine times since - it's not cheap, but it's not unduly expensive, and it's worth every penny
Delicious, authentic Italian food (with AL DENTE pasta, the way it's supposed to be!) and charming, courteous service - Baci Abracci is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood
I'm vegetarian so I can't say much about the meat dishes (although they seem quite innovative), but I can say that the fusilli with fennel sauce and the red beet gnocchi are both delicious, and the pizza rivals - if not surpasses - that of Fornino down the block, which is saying a lot
But the best thing about this restaurant, in my opinion, is the friendly, gracious attitude of the hosts and wait staff
They always greet me and my friends warmly, deliver food promptly, are happy to answer questions about the menu, and they almost always throw in a free dessert at the end of the meal! Baci Abracci is possibly my favorite new restaurant in New York City, and certainly my favorite in Williamsburg
Highly recommended!
I've been here about 7 times and I'm still trying to find something I don't like
These people have definitely done something right here
From the seafood appetizers to the pizzas pastas, the menu has variety and quality
The staff and restaraunt provide a relaxing atmosphere and they have a huge patio which is always a plus
the place is straight out of the upper east side
the design doesn't suit the neighborhood, but the food is pretty solid
i ate there last week and it was solid
my only problem is that now i have to split time between 5 italian restaurants within walking distance of me
What a great addition to the neighborhood! baci abbracci is a charming Italian restaurant with a gorgeous outdoor patio
The individual pizzas are thin crust and some of the best pizzass I've had in New York
Their pastas casarecce are homemade - ravioli, papardelle, gnocchi, and lasagna
Their pasta is al dente - which I was quite excited about as a lot of Italian places overcook their pasta
Everything is fresh, inventive, delightful, and generous in portion size
They also have lots of specials - the other night there was an arrancini appetizer (rice croquettes served with sauteed zuchini and eggplant with tomato), a homemade pumpkin ravioli, and an italian ricotta cheesecake topped with chocolate mousse and coffee ladyfingers
The wine list is extensive with some great bottles that are moderately priced (quite a few in the 25 dollar range)
I've been a couple of times and I can't wait to go back - the menu is large with lots of amazing looking dishes! The staff if also attentive and quite knowlegeable about wine - ask the owners Mimmo or Paulo for advice

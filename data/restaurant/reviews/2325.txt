The waiters are not smartasses - they're just not zombies who say Yes, Sir without considering the question
And for those ladies who could care less about cuisine and more about eye candy, the waiters at Med are perhaps the best looking on the UES
Had a great lunch one sunday afternoon! The warm calamari salad was excellent! Fun to sit on the sidewalk and people watch
Hear it gets crowded for dinner but not many places around to go to afterwards except may-be a movie right up the block
After reading the reviews, I thought what a great place, and then afterwards I realized this is why I never eat on the upper east side! The place was so loud - for a TUESDAY! The pasta wasnt even cooked
The waiters loom over you so they can get the table cleared ready, but there was no one waiting
Overall - A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!
I've lived 2 blocks away from Mediterraneo for the last 8 years and I still get cravings for the tagliolini al salmone every week
It is by far one of the best restaurants in New York
They just opened a new one called Za Za (i think) on First avenue, and can't wait to go there!
Great Place - very quaint and cozy
Awesome Food and Amazing Staff - what more could you want????
Hands down my favorite restaurant in the city
It's very chic and charming (fireplace, dark-paneled wood, candles everywhere), the maitre-d always greets me by name, and the food is DELICIOUS
I'm obsessed with the lobster pasta, endive salad, mussels, baked clams, steak (I could go on and on), and the wine is really good at a not too expensive price
This is the kind of place that looks like it will cost several hundred dollars to eat at, but the food is amazingly affordable for the quality (plus, I always spot random celebrities when I'm here!) I will be returning here for years to come
I went here for the first time recently for a party, and let me just say that it isn't so great
I wouldn't say the word bad, but I will definitely steer clear from the word great
To put it bluntly, this is a little tucked-away restaurant that is big on ambience/decor, but small on taste and an innovative menu
The salads, appetizers, and ravioli were all just bland (like I said, nothing great), but the worst came with the entirely mediocre entree (lamb), and dessert was no better
Don't even get me started on the wine or climate controls!
Went there for dinner last night
place was pretty empty, but the food was unbelievable
Distinct flavors, with exeptional taste
Cozy atmosphere, and the staff make you feel right at home
Smart business people too
last night, it was pretty empty and they offered us after dinner drinks on the house and brought me a cannoli after I told them I couldn't eat it, but that it was my favorite
Good stuff, I'm glad someone took me there, because I will definitely be going back for seconds
This cozy restaurant has excellent food and a beautiful decor
I recommend the mozzarella caprese to start, but everything is good
This is a phenominal date place
You have to go upstairs and sit by the fireplace
The service was great and the food is very good
They let you order off the menu
Only drawback: I am 29 and was the youngest person in there by 20 years
Very classy place - I was very impressed
Great ambience, excellent food at a fair price and superior service
Good neighborhood place
The salads were very tasty as was the grilled octopus
I don't know that I would travel too far to eat here but if you're in the area it's a great deal
This place is great! The food is delicious with large portion, the service is very friendly and warm
Prix menu for dinner is only 26USD, really worth to try
the disserts are so pretty
We are so happy with the dinner and will definitely go back again!
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG HERE
THEY ARE WORTH THE TRIP
AFTER STUMBLING OVER THIS TREASURE, I HAVE MADE THIS PLACE A NEW ADDITION TO MY FAVORITES
THEY HAVE A PRIX-FIXE MENU FOR BRUNCH, LUNCH AND DINNER THAT IS WORTH IT
THE MENU CHANGES DAILY WITH NEW SPECIALS
AND TRUST ME YOU CAN'T GO WRONG EATING HERE
PRICES ARE AFFORDABLE, SERVICE IS FRIENDLY, DELICIOUS FOOD AND LARGE SERVINGS WITH AN OPTIONAL OUTDOOR SEATING AREA
A-RATING
went there once and the bagel with white fish was good
i tried to get a fruit salad as extra using the entertainment coupon
after the guy behind the counter mumbled something, the owner rushed out from the back and said we don't know what that is
we don't take that!
he sounded a little mean to me
he insisted that somebody made a mistake
because of this incident, i don't think i'll go back there
i can find good bagles with better service somewhere else
These bagels are so good! The only others on par are Ess a Bagel's bagels
I have to give Healthy Bagel the one up, however, because of the variety found
The Challah bagels, which I have never seen anywhere else, are simply the best
You must go!
All I can say is I've lived in Manhattan for 29 years and these are the best bagels I've ever encountered anywhere
The owner is in there every morning working his behind off making sure his business is running at top form
Sure it's a little more expensive than the grocery store, but it's a bargain considering that you're getting the best
My husband has lived in the area for almost 20 years and took me here on our first date
The Sangria is amazing, the stuffed mushrooms are to die for
we always order the Filet Migon Malaga and the Shrimp alla Chef (around 30 shrimp) and the strawberry cheese cake
We come here around once a month for a great meal
The decor is very dated
but the place is a favorite for us
You should check it out
definetly work a try
We also took some friends here and they loved it as well!  Enjoy !
Although the decor of this restaurant doesn't measure up to most others in NYC, my boyfriend and I keep coming back because the food is delicious! I am always in search of good Spanish restaurants being I've lived in Spain and LOVE the food, and I must say the food brings me back every time! I recommend the tapas (emapanadas y croquetas) and we always order the sangria
Also, it's reasonably priced
This is a true find in NYC! The food is delicious and the portions are large enough to share or take home leftovers
It's perfect for a quick dinner or even a large group
Start with the yummy tapas and share some of the larger plates for dinner
You won't regret it!
my parents would take me here as a kid, since they lived around the corner when it first opened and they always enjoyed it
i was surprised recently to learn that it was still around
while the decor is probably the same as it was back in the 70's, the food is great
the chicken vie la roi is incredible
the kind of food you wake up craving in the middle of the night
the sangria is excellent
Although the decor is right out of 1973, this restaurant is not to be missed
It has an varried and interesting menu with many choices
The wine list is easy-to-follow (try the sangria)
The soups, including the black bean and the sopa de mariscos were delicious (and they're not cheap with the seafood)
The prices are what you'd expect in NYC
OK, so the place isn't the nicest, but the service is outstanding, the food delicious and the prices can't be beat
It was recommended to me by a co-worker who frequented it years ago
From her description it hasn't changed and is still fantastic
It's an Upper East Side find that I would gladly go to again and again
I went with a group of friends last night, and I was nervous based on what I'd read
It turned out, however, that the food is good, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is fun
Of course it's a dump, have you ever seen a beautiful Spanish restaurant? We lingered over tapas and sangria for about two hours, and all the items we tried were tasty (the octopus was a bit mushy)

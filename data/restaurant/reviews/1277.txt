long story short
group of gals got together, we have early reservations, but couldnt make it on time due to unexpected circumstances
et the reservationist know
she seemed irritated by the call
got there
went to bar
bartender (ouch
did he just start today??) made some terrible tasting drinks
we kindly told him (as we all work in customer service and understand customers) he rolled his eyeballs, and charged us for the drinks anyway to replace them
if you into ambience this is the place you want, good crowd to look at
food?!?! other fusion places in town are far better
for a place with sushi on the menu, the rolls should have been melting in my mouth, not chewing on them till the morning after
$ is okay for what you get
Enjoy!
check out cellar bar while you there; warning: avoid the 20-something drunks hanging all over the place, with cheesy pick up lines
Overall, a great experience
The food was outstanding and the service was much better than I expected
When the buzz is so hot, I often find myself disappointed
But, not at Koi
I will be back
We were having a reunion dinner so we were a large party of 8+
I made a reservation only a week in advance for a Friday night and we were seated immediately upon arrival
The hostess was friendly and the waiter was extremely helpful
We were pleasantly surprised that the usually overpriced fruity martinis were actually affordable and very large so we only needed one round
The Crab roll and tuna tartare were unbelievable and the dessert sampler was a perfect tasting and the perfect size for sharing
Overall, we had a great experience, much better than we have been having lately at other japanese fusion type places here in NYC
Definitely visit Koi soon
One of the best japaneese restaurants I have ever eaten at
The service was great
We walked in and sat down right away
The waitress was friendly and attentive
She recommeneded many dishes to us and we enjoyed them all
The atmosphere was fun
A little loud, but lots of good people watching
I liked the decour too
The dishes I will recommend are Creamy Rock Shrimp, Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna and White Asparagus - Dungeness Crab, Osetra Watercress Pesto
The bill was expensive but worth every penny
My wife and I dined at Koi about a week ago, and after hearing so much 'buzz' about this place, finally went
The fine-dining experience was tossed in the trash by the snooty waitress and her 'You're so lucky to be dining here' attitude
When asked a few questions about the food and wine selections, she seemed bored and irritated
We've dined at the L
A
Koi, and found it much more fun and laid-back
If her nose were any further in the air, she'd have to use an oxygen mask to work
Learn congeniality or get another job
Excellent Sushi is found at several OTHER NY establishments that make you feel welcome, not an inconvenience
A friend of mine has been bragging about it so I went with a couple of friends
We had a blast
We had this great server from germany who knew everything on the menu and matched a great $200 bottle of wine
We had a vegetarian and an allergy case (sesameseeds) at the table and he managed so wonderfully in taking requests and finding items on the menu
He took great care of us
We never had to wait long for the next course to come out
We'll be back soon !!!
I'm a person who loves good food; thus really enjoying a 'night out' for dinner
I had heard how Koi is the 'it' spot out in L
A
GREAT!!$@^%@ Truth is, knowing this, the NY'er in me had no expectations when going in for dinner
Tell you what, I loved this place
The atmosphere is definitely a 'scene' and somewhat chaotic, but the the food and service make you forget the noise
My waiter whose name I forget, think accent is French, was awesome
Not to mention, how cool it was having Leonardo and Giselle in the booth next to us
My friends loved it and so did I
Thanks guys!!! We'll be back, no question
The place is way overpriced
Service was terrible
Food is mediocre, at best
I ate at Koi last night, and I have to say that it could not have gone better
Beyond being a total cutie, my server made excellent reccomendations, and the timing out of the dishes my table shared was just perfect
We were afraid of being overwhelmed with to much to fast, especially given the crowded dining room and the wait for tables at the door, but we were really pleased with how everything turned out
All in all, an expensive night, but you're paying for more than just the meal when you dine here
I was looking forward to the opening of this place and I have been a couple times since
Customers do not need to be insulted while they dine
This isnt LA, we dont care who you waited on last night, or how many stand in roles you've had on LawOrder
I over heard atleast 3 other people flipping out at their servers
What people do care about is hearing about the menu and cocktails
When your overzealous kitchen brings out the food all at once way too quickly how about apologizing and have the manager come over
It doesnt take this long to work out the kinks people
It's a shame because theres some potential to be great here
THE SERVICE IS EMBASSING!!
Beyond a doubt, one of the noisiest, fast service (beyond enjoyment) restaurants in NYC
It's a pretty place but the decible level makes your ears bleed! And the trendoids are just oozing with cool to the point they become caricatures of hip-ness! As for the food?? Koi's forte is supposedly sushi but, everyone in our party of 6 who had it said it was good, not great
Those that had meat and duck were equally underwhelmed
Desserts were outrageous though! Oh! Another outrageous thing?? The check!
It is too bad that the attitude from the staff and lack of professionalism will ultimately lead to the demise of this place
All the pretty people from one table to the next
What does the staff (waiters) thinks they are??? Though the food is good you are still left with a bad taste in your mouth due to the prices
Do not let the staff bully you when you order, as the food comes out really fast
Order one or two things at a time or you will be done and out in no time
I went there for lunch and it had a great scene with a young business crowd
The great thing is that the menu remains the same so you can order to your content
Koi may be new to New York, but it is a welcome home for those of us who crave a dining experience to die for
The servers are gorgeous, the crowd to be seen with and the scene to crowd in for
This place has the elements of style down, lets hope the losers stay out
The place might look nice, but you are going to be looking at it for a long time with no drinks, no food and especially no service
The restaurant does not know how to handle its tables and the managers do not know how to act to solve the problems the servers have caused
Not worth the money or the wait
The food is nice but not good enough to make up for the lackluster crowd and the slightly amatuer service
In NYC, you really need to hit on a couple of key items be it the ambience, the food or the service and this place is just average, average, average!
I went to Koi the other night, knowing that it had just opened
Well, you could tell they were still working out the kinks a bit, but I'm glad I managed to get in before it gets to jammed to ever get a table

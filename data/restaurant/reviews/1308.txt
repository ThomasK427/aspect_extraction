I recently had dinner at Fillip's and I would definatly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a classy dinner for a good price
The wine especially caught my taste buds and was a great part of my Halibut dinner
The food at Fillip's is superb
I have eaten at many of the four star restaurants in NYC and this one can keep up with any of them but the great part is the PRICE
Absolutely faboulous and you wont break the bank to do it
I recommend the warm asparagus, yellow fin tuna tartare, rack of lamb and the Kobe beef
As a Tribeca resident, I end up eating here at least once a month
The food is fantastic and varied, and the atmosphere is always superb
I highly recommend the Bouley Burger (a very substantial meal!), as well as the spicy tuna and the dragon roll
Best part: two people can have a decent sized meal with a drink or two for less than $50
Walking by this place last night, I couldn't help but notice the good vibe coming from both the outdoor talbes and the small dinning room upstairs
A lot of good energy
All the tables upstairs were taken, so we decided to eat at the sushi bar
It's actually really entertaining to watch not only the sushi chefs, but also the chef behind the stove at work
The kitchen is actually in the small dining room
Chef was cool, interacting with patrons
Food was delicious
Such an eclectic menu
The menu is small, but you still feel like there is so much to choose from - salads, fish, chicken, sushi, steak (sirlon was good)
and the Bouley Burger was GREAT too
Bouley Bakery is as close as you'll get to getting good bread and cakes in Manhattan
But the service is so bad! Completely useless and unfriendly, I can live with paying almost 6$ for a piece of cake but it would be nice if the people behind the cash register would not throw it at my face as if I was bothering them for being there!
I went in to grab a sandwich for lunch and discovered that this place is too small to handle the volume
The customer waiting area is cramped at best, and I was constantly in someone's way
Some of the pastries weren't labelled or priced, and the staff behind the counter didn't know the pricing
I learned the hard way: $5
50 for a raspberry macaroon is pricey, even by Tribeca standards
I won't be going back
The restaurant above the bakery is cozy and small
The food is absolutely delicious! I recommend the mushroom salad and the halibut entree
Prices are reasonable
One of my favorite restaurants in the city, the food is delicious, service impeccable and the staff knowledgeable
The Rack of Lamb and the Grilled Tuna are exceptional and the pastas divine
I recommend making reservations though; they tend to be busy
The new executive chef has rejuvenated Sullivan Diner
The food is wonderful- fresh, intricately prepared, and obscenely tasty
DO TRY -his hand-corned beef -his homemade vinegar and dill pickles
the vinegar pickles are THE BEST I HAVE HAD IN NEW YORK CITY
-the Monte Cristo Sandwich -the Reuben Sandwich -fried calamari is a must  -homemade fries and chips -mac cheese
If your looking for casual yet uncomprised dining in the West Village, this is the place for you
While the decor is refreshing and sleek, the food is warm and comforting
I have been in for Brunch and Dinner, and all my friends agree
the food is amazing and the people are super-friendly
It's all about the Banana Bread Sundae dessert
It's not really, everything I've ordered has been delicious but this dessert is incredible
I've been trying to remember a dessert I've enjoyed more and I can't
3 slices of warm homemade banana bread with chocolate chips and nuts, topped with banana ice cream and carmelized bananas
I've gotten at least 5 people from my office to check this place out and they've all loved it
Delicious food, detailed presentation and unbelievably inexpensive
Can have a great dinner for two for under $50
Peaceful atmosphere and wonderful food
I can't believe its vegan - especially the moist carrot cake and the delicious soybuttermilk biscuits
Great shakes and drinks but come for the divine selection of tapas and the great salads (the shiitake and spinach gets major props)
And the service is fabulous (Paul rocks!) - very knowledgeable and attentive yet unobtrusive
I feel blessed to have found this place
this is a very serene place with tasty food
too bad they don't get enough foot traffic because it's on such a quiet street
it's hard to find a tasty vegetarian salad in new york city after lunch but i found it here
the combination tapas plates are a good deal because you can choose from a selection of noodles, proteins, greens and hummus of the day
i walked away feeling full, healthy and satisfied even though it's vegetarian
as a life long vegetarian, i want to state that this place has the best vegetarian food ive ever had
highly recommended
This italian esque coffee bar is a nice change for tribeca
its nice to sit down and relax in the leather booths and drink espresso while people watching
try the sandwiches , they are awesome
also the cupcakes are yummy
Great location, delicious sandwiches and scrumptious desserts -- inexpensive by today's standards
Can't wait to return!
I was wary of having lunch at an ever-expanding chain that sells conserves at most good supermarkets, but I had nothing to worry about
This is a welcoming oasis for respite amidst the hussle of tourists, office workers and carriage horses
Generous and inventive salads and hearty sandwiches filled us up and made us happy here
The desserts were also well-received
The room felt like we were stepping back in time into a CPS restaurant sometime in the 1960s - bright, airy and green
Our waitress was clear, fast and friendly (but, honey, enough with the quirky ties!) Plus this is a very affordable place in this neighborhood of $500 t-shirts
stop by on my way back to my hotel and had some of the specials, they were excellent
Can't stand the lines at brunch but dinner was a different story
Looking forward to going back
Thanks
Coffee served without sugar/milk and took more than 10 min to catch the waiter to ask for it
Another 10 min to get it
Pot of hot water brought to the table for tea, and tea bags assortment came more than 5 min later when hot water was not that hot anymore
My companion dropped her folk, so apologized and nicely asked the waiter to bring another
We had to ask the other waiter to bring it when her plate served
One staff was so attentive to take away my plate as soon as I finished the last bite and put down the folk, while water or coffee was never refilled
Other staff dropped and broke some dishes at 5 away from our table
No apology
Everything was disorganized and hopeless
Well, they werent rude (at least) but no effort was shown in them to be any better than McDonalds
I don't understand why this place is so popular
There is always a long wait for a table for brunch, and I don't understand why
The food is totally average, and the service is at best average
My wife ordered a cappucino and it took nearly a half hour for them to bring it
in fact, our brunch courses all came out before they finally brought it
They offered us 7 grain toast, which we ordered, and it wasn't 7 grain- it was whole wheat (completely different)
The omlettes were runny even though we ordered well-done
Overall it was OK, but hardly good enough to justify the ooohing and ahhhing that it seems to get
Prices are more or less reasonable
Forget the fact that this Sarabeth's lacks the atmosphere of the others
it lacks everything else too! The place is run like a zoo
It's loud, obnoxious and there are so many managers running around that there is virtually no staff to assist

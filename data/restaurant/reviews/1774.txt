The food and atmosphere were good, but the service was a bit stereo typical
After the waiter brought out eveyone but my wife's order, he walked away
We assumed that he left to get her dish
After about 5 minutes, we called our waiter over and asked what happened to her food
His reply to her was You ordered something?
not the right response
He went to compare the tape to his notepad and saw he forgot to put her order in! My wife had to watch us eat until they brought her food and then was the only one eating once she was served
The waiter said to us it was my fault, I forgot to enter the order
I just put it in, but in my book that's not really an apology
Petite Abeille is a truly friendly neighborhood spot that always makes us feel at home
The service is always sincere and the ambiance is super non-protentious
All the dishes especially the chicken pot pie and fish stew are delicious adn the mussels are the freshest I've had in the city-ever!!! They also have a great selection of international beers to go with your dish
This is my favorite of all the monster sushi's I've dined at (I've been to 535 hudson 46th st also)
I've been there at least a dozen times
The pieces are pretty big; I always feel stuffed after eating the lunch special
Everything has always been VERY fresh; the rolls are HUGE - and sometimes they have toro! The service is usually very good
the ambiance is nice; nothing exceptional, but always pleasant
my partner and I make a weekly visit and the sushi is always oh sooo good! The fish is extremely fresh and the pieces are llarge
most sushi places do not compare, and we have visit quite a few over the years
not too sure about the non sushi items because we are all about the sushi
This place is horrible
Well, quality sushi came with a $$$ price tag but this joint is serving up low quality sushi for $$$
My date order a Futomaki Roll and these people here can't roll it tight
The sushi felt apart and the rice was dried
I simply don't trust them handling my raw fish
So, I ordered a teriyaki steak intead
For $18, I am getting a 3 dollars piece of London Broil cooked in soy sauce and sugar
By the way, this is one of the many pseudo Japanese restaurants in NYC that is giving sushi a bad name
Won't go back there even is free
Yucks!
I wish this place was better
The fish is nicely fresh and they have a full menu
Service is perfunctory, slow, and obtuse
Taste on the non-sushi dishes is bland Chinese-restaurant MSG rather than properly Japanese
It would also help if they said Welcome or Thank you at either en dof the meal
Just a bummer of a place to go for lunch in a neighborhood generally starved for good eats
I've eaten there about 100 times over 6+ years now
Only one time did I think the sushi was anything but great and it was still good
The staff is very nice and prompt
Definitely try the white tuna, it's amazing
if you want quantity but inconsistent quality then this will suit you
generous portions but servings spoils your appetite to eat more
appetizers are good, but sushi quality I suspect is not the best
lots of food for decent (for Manhattan) prices
Not a single thing I have eaten there has wowed me
If it were next to a cheap takeout sushi place, I'd have a hard time deciding
We walked in and were immediately seated which is a huge plus!! The Dragon Roll was to die for as was the Gyoza
Sampled the chicken teryaki but it was a little sweet
I would stick with the sushi ad apps and you will have an awesome meal!
I took my girl here for our one-year anniversary
the food was out of this world
the fried shrimp dumplings melt in your mouth and the tempura was so light !! That's just the appetizers
The Monster roll and super white tuna blew us away
The service was nice
Lastly, I simply could not leave without 2 of those super cool black Monster Sushi t-shirts!
If you come here for your regular california or tuna rolls, then you are missing out
Their specialty rolls are amazing
Their Dragon roll or their Monster Roll is awsome
Big pieces and very tasty
I've tried their teriyaki chicken and other hot entrees and they were below avg
I recommend you to eat only specialty rolls here
And price is not expensive
Two rolls will fill you up
Stick to the 23rd street branch one though
I love this place! It doesn't get any better than this when it comes to sushi
The pieces are very big and the quality is always good
Fresh fish is whats important when it comes to sushi not the size of it and Monster Sushi has both
You must - must try the super white tuna
It melts in your mouth like butter - I promise you will not be disappointed
The service could use some improvements, they are not quick to take your order
The atmosphere is nothing special
Quality sushi is why your going!
Extremely good quality, Incredible portion size
Eat like a pig for 1/2 of what it would cost anywhere else
Holy Godzilla! Batman! This restaurant really is great
Food and prices are very good compared to other rest
in the area
Service is fair
Largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious! Very good service and very good prices
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service
Killer Sushi!
excellent food preparation
Staff took care of all needs
Size of sushi monsterous with out the monster price
great dinner out
I'm a steady customer that demands the best
While it's not the best sushi in NYC, it definitely fills your stomache and leaves you happy
We were seated right away, although all the way in the back
The food came out right away
Had trouble finishing the rolls
but left completely satisfied
Good bang for the buck
I'm going to spread the word
Very fresh sushi - generous portions and very well priced, what more acn you ask for!
Monster Sushi, a small sushi house tucked in between the store fronts on 23rd Street in Chelsea is one of the best places to get sushi in the city
It's friendly staff, fair pricing, quality food and ample seating uniquely positions Monster Sushi as a first class sushi restaurant
def
not good service and YEs u will be rushed, but having lived in ny, i'll take good food over good service anyday - as long as they do not make you wait an hour for your entree
the monster roll is def

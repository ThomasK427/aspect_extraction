The menu is full of gems without it being overwhelming
Reasonably priced
Pleasant atmosphere
Highly recommend
I went there tonight with 7 friends
We were seated as soon as my party arrived
The staff was very accomodating since we were supposed to be 6 and two more people showed up
I found out that the place was in business just more than a week, the service could have been better but it was fine by my standard and I eat at a lot of restaurants
Every single person at my table loved the food
I really recommend the goat cheese tart or the carpaccio but my favorite was the monkfish mousse
For a main course the scallops or the dorade are really good
I tried the panisse fries and they were good, not my favorite thing but if you want French fries then don't order them
Desserts were very impressive
Strawberries and greek yogurt, warm chocolate tart wth gianduja ice cream and the fruit salad with watermelon granite was refreshing
Best part is the wine list
We had a muscat and a bottle of red, both under $40 prices starts just above $25
I must say that I have been to a few restaurants after they had just open and they were not as good as this one
At the end, our check came to $65 per person, including tax and tip (and 4 bottles of wine and fiji water)
One thing that you must know, they do not have a hard liquor license so don't expect vodka or gin
I wanted to try out Intent since its in a great area and I heard some good buzz
I had an 8pm resie and got there around 7:30
Unfortunately there were only 2 people at the bar, so figured I would just sit at my table vs hanging at the desolate bar area
After taking a look at the cool back tent area and the front cafe like environment we opted for the front seating area
The hostess then informed us that she couldnt seat us until 8pm because the restaurant was packed
Cut to sound of crickets and wait staff standing in corners talking to each other
What?! Filled restaurant? Cant seat us till 8? Ummmm
ok
Finally after waiting around for 15 minutes and seeing no movement we told the hostess we'd like to be seated at which point she walked us over to sit right next to the only other copule in the section! After finally getting seated we opened the limited menu and opted for the goat cheese tart and short ribs- very good
We also ordered one of the fish dishes and a side of fries, which are actually made of hummus
We said we'd try them and they were gross
Thick and pasty and not like fries at all
They werent removed from the bill depsite our building a house out of them and telling the waiter we were displeased
We also spoke to the manager who seemed disinterested in our lackluster evening
So overall the prices are reasonbable and its in a fun area
But if you're looking for a fun time at a place that isnt trying so hard to be the next it place, then just hang at rice to riches instead where they actually value their patrons and dont make you wait
Eating at the just recently opened InTent was a lovely experience-- the ambience is beautiful, the food fresh and orginal
We had the eggplant tart (nice) and the filo-crusted dorade (delicious, though could have used a side dish)
The waitsatff seemed a bit unsure of themselves, and wasn't quite as attentive as they should be (he would check in about every 25 minutes or so), but perhaps that's something that could work out in time
I have a feeling this place will start to get very crowded, very soon, so enjoy it while the quiet loveliness lasts
I attended the opening of Krunch Pizza and the pizza there was thick, crunchy, and DELICIOUS!! The pizzas were all in squares and the place had great toppings
Also the people that work there were very friendly, I would definitely go there again
The opening was crazy I think the Public Relations firm that represents them did an awesome job with getting people to come, I think they're based in Manhattan
I checked out their website: amp3pr(dot)(comm) and they do a whole bunch of other cool events
The pizza is different! It was sold by the square and had a great selection of toppings
While waiting for my pizza i was told that the owners mother brought most of the recipes from italy
The pizza was phenomeal i will definetly be back very soon!!!!!
Ate here on thurs night
the food was great and was not cowded at all
The waiter explained that they just opened a few weeks ago
I feel like a discovered something before anyone else
This will be the place to be seen this fall for sure
Cheap and Tasty
if you're looking for something new and different in nyc, this is the place to check out!! you will not be disappointed
the service was great and the atmosphere was chill
very beautiful interesting interior design details too
most of all, the menu is to die for!! it was not easy narrowing the choices down of what to order, which is why i'm going back again soon
i'm still thinking about their ginger chicken and winter shabu-shabu!! the papaya drink was so delicious too
an overall great dining experience in LES!!
SMAC is a great idea a place where you can just get a good plate of mac n cheese
I have been waiting for a place with macaroni and cheese as the major meal to come around for a while
Unfortunately this is not the place
SMAC has a great variety of mac n cheese and the prices are reasonable for the nice portions they serve
If you want a good serving of mac n cheese in several flavors, SMAC will fit the bill perfectly
I found all the varieties I tasted to be too liquid none stuck together the way a good homemade one really does even Kraft is gooier if you use less milk
The regular American was not extremely flavorful and sadly just a cut above the kind youd find behind the hot counter at a deli or salad bar with a powdery texture in the sauce
I would have to go with the Kraft regular mac n cheese box with the powder, over the one at SMAC, though Id keep it in the fridge for a day and then heat it up for a great texture
Gruyere and mozzarella were about the same and the gruyere should have been sharper like a good Swiss gruyere is, while the mozzarella should have been more garlicky and cheesy stringy like a good lasagna or nice pizza
For novelty this is a fine QUICK stop if you are in the neighborhood but if you want a REALLY GREAT and untraditional mac n cheese youll head to the wonderful and trendy DuMont in Williamsburg for their OUTSTANDING DuMac and Cheese
It is the citys BEST
What you get at this place is not mac 'n cheese, it's more like average tasting pasta with cream sauce
My boyfriend and I went to S'MAC for dinner on Friday night
We ordered three different kinds of mac n cheese in the nosh size, which was more than enough food (we ended up taking some home)
We tried the gruyere and slab bacon, four cheese, and cheeseburger
My favorite was the gruyere with bacon
The food was delicious and I can't wait to go back to try the brie mac with figs and shiitake mushrooms and the goat cheese mac
My one complaint is that the tables and chairs are so close together
The fun, bright colors evoked childhood memories, but I could have dealt with more space
If you haven't checked out S'Mac yet, do it right away
It's this mac n cheese place in the East Village
Talk about a great idea - comfort food with some awesome variations
We tried the 4 Cheese, the Gruyere(my fav) and the Cajun
they were all cooked to perfection and as cheesy as it can get! The wait in the line was totally worth it and I'm NOT a line person :-) What was also nice about this place was the service
very friendly and not rushed
Ok so we've been hearing about this mac n cheese place in East Village and finally got to check it out
it's awesome! The food was fabulous! We even got to speak with one of the owners, Sarita
Apparently they opened to a bigger than anticipated crowd and things were a bit overwhelming but everything is under control now and they have some great cooks on board
We ordered four different items in the smallest nosh size and my fav was the All American (dripping with cheese!) and the goat cheese one
I would definitely go back and recommend this place to all you cheese fans!
We ventured to S'Mac right after they opened, and ordered the gruyere/bacon and the goat cheese/kalamata olive macs
Even though the place was jammed, the woman behind the counter was chatting with us as we waited
We asked how things were going, and she said that they are settling in after a crazy first couple of weeks, and that they had just gotten some new equipment and were starting to settle in nicely
Turns out that it was Sarita - the owner! She was super nice, and we sat down to bubbling skillets
The gruyere was delicious - the bacon gives the nutty cheese a nice balance, and the breadcrumbs contribute a nice crunch
I was a little wary of the goat cheese version, but it was my favorite
The olives are salty and the roasted garlic is sweet - sooo good
I can't wait to go back and try the cheeseburger!
The idea is splendid
I LOVE mac and cheese
But when you open a restaurant that specializes in mac and cheese, you would think that the mac and cheese would be amazing, or at least pretty good
Alas, it was a waste of $8

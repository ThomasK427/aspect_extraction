And now, with the expantion of a restaurant featuring a dinner menu and even brunch(!!!), this cozy neighborhood favorite (and only) is open into the evening
The new outdoor garden is lovely (so is the fact that they have an outdoor garden) and stopping in twice makes you a regular!  Thank God for this spot
It is what makes a neighborhood a neighborhood
I've passed this restaurant many times over the years, always being scared off by its garish decor and harsh lighting
Last night I finally decided to try the food
This is as basic as Italian-American gets and I am really suprised by La Villa's popularity, especially when there are so many great alternatives nearby
Wonder-bread-ish garlic bread was followed overly sauced, overly garlic-ed, an oversized pasta dishes
The broccoli rabe side was fine, but again with too much garlic which masked the biter flavor of the vegetable; and it was floating in too much liquid
Someone told us that the pizzas are good here, so I will try one soon, but for now this place looks like an Italian version of that famous end-of-week chain
We walked in late with a party of five on a Wednesay night and had a twenty minute wait
I'm so glad we waited
EVERYTHING is good
Your tastebuds are teased but the incredibly good garlic bread at the table
You absolutely must try the homemade meatballs as an appetizer! The calamari is equally as good
Everyone's entrees were delicious! The pizza speciale was great and so was the La Villa Special entree! I wish we had room for dessert but it was late and we were all getting tired
All the patrons are loyal customers and you will be, also!
I live in the neighborhood and was eager to try this Indian establishment because I love that type of food
Unfortunately, I found the price is expensive and the quality way below average
The most common dishes were mediocre at best
The chicken masala tasted like it had a pound of sugar added; same with saag panir
I do not plan to return even though it is conveniently located
I wanted this to be an enjoyable experience but last left with a bad taste
Roomates sampled some of the meal and confirmed
Excellent service, great food, lovely people
I always have a great experience when i eat here
Every time ahs been better than the next
Very kind and eager to please, though not necessary, since food speaks for itself and is very reasonably priced
Everyone should try this place!
Every dish we've ordered was delicious
We've yet to be disappointed
There is no reason for us to try another Indian restaurant
Just mention Bombay Grill to me and watch my mouth water
It's like a physiological reflex
I've been to this restaurant twice for lunch in two weeks and each time have received excellent service (attentive! polite!) and food so good it made me exclaim aloud
Lunch specials are not skimpy -- they are full-size! I recommend the shag ponir and mushroom shag
And try the spine-tingling ka-chori appetizer, described on the menu as too difficult to put into words, but recommend!
In Short Coffee aficionados will immediately note the huge red roaster capable of handling 30 pounds of beans at a time
As large wall maps and nearby burlap sacks attest, those coffee beans (which are all fair trade-certified) hail from Africa, Indonesia and South America
Free Wi-Fi access means customers with laptops often occupy the small Formica tables flanked by Eames-style chairs
The small display case of brownies and cookies is a sweet addition
I love Gorilla's fresh coffee, but what's up with the owner staying open when it's over 100 degrees outside and there's no air conditioning? (That's what is happening right now, and apparently she's threatened to fire anyone who called out!) What about workers' rights? That's seriously not cool
It's a shame that such a great coffeeshop with such a great product is owned by somebody with such poor ethics
I really do want to support small businesses, but not when they're run like this
The coffee is great
The music is great
The decor is great
The staff is funny and also just really great
The bathroom is disgustingly dirty but I've overlooked that
However, I'm not going back
For four days the owner of Gorilla has left her employees without air conditioning in this record breaking heat
The staff walks around like zombies and they look ill
It is at least 15 degrees hotter inside Gorilla than outside
I am appalled that they are forced to work without any AC
It's embarrassing and says too much about the owner
Neighborhood feel, world-class quality; great place to pick up a drink and run, or if time allows, hang-out for a good vibe
Gorilla makes a damn fine cup of joe and gives Park Slope some rock and roll chutzpah
I love their smooth and strong ice coffee
and am running out to get one now
I travel to Italy for business and this place is the real deal
They make you feel like an old friend from the first visit
And the food is amazing
From classic dishes to the specials, you will never be disappointed
It is a hidden gem
One evening we had a grilled octopus appetizer that had us talking for days
The pasta dishes are incredible and we are determined to work our way through their entire menu
And one last thing, I also had the best Dirty Martini ever
You can't go wrong
This is a great restaurant
Still relatively new so not too busy
It's a very relaxed atmosphere and the food is excellent
The Mexican Traditional dishes are outstanding and a nice variation from the Mexican-American food
The standard faijitas, burritoes etc are also very good
They are also very quick to deliver
Don't forget order the mountain of amazing guacamole
The food was fresh and tasted delicious, the decor of the restaurant made the experience even better
You can't find any place like this in Queens
I definitely say this is a two thumbs up from me!
Kyoto has great food, not over priced, good customer service and a wonderful atmosphere, I would definately recommend it for a group of friends, it's even a great place to bring dates
MY MOTHER AND I WERE IN THE MOOD FOR SOME SUSHI AND I HEARD THIS PLACE GOT GD RATINGS, SO WE WENT THERE ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON
THE SUSHI WAS EXCELLENT BUT, THE HOSTESS WAS RUDE AS WELL AS THE WAITRESS WE HAD
IF THEY REPLACED THE TWO WITH NICER AND FRIENDLIER PEOPLE, THE RESTAURANT WOULD BE A MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE PLACE TO BE
I've been here quite a number times
I'm not a fan of any of their appetizers or Thai food, but their Japanese food is great
I love the creative rolls that they have on their menus, and none of them were a disappointment
Sushi and sashimi are excellent as well!  The servers were really attentive, which is good in a way
However, it feels like they hover over us, and almost feels like they want us to leave
I've had this happen a few times, so it didn't just happen once
Clearly a unique restaurant in Queens
the food is simply amazing and very different from any other restaurants in the area
its dual appeal came when my girlfriend who doesnt enjoy raw food, the thai kitchen offered an array of hot spicy dishes
this may be offset somewhat by the service where it does get slow/crowded on weekends
the space is particularly large (good for big parties) with a nice decor of finished wood and glow of blue lights
I was celebrating my 30th birthday here with a bunch of friends and it was one of the best dining experience I have ever had
The food was out of this world - especially the DYNAMITE
The wait staff was friendly and the decor was beautiful
I definitely will reccommend this place for big parties but be sure to call in advance for a reservsation because this place really gets packed fast
Even though the place was packed and full, the waitress came around several times to asked if everything was okay
I disagree with some of the other reviews because I thought the service was great
I highly reccommend this place to everyone
The food was excellent and the ambience was great

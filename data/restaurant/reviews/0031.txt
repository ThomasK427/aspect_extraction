It's crowded, but that only shows you how popular the food is! Ingredients are fresh and savory
The bread is perfect
The best deal is the Quatro Panini for $10 that lets you sample 4 different panini, like a tasting menu
Trust me, you'll have trouble deciding which is your favorite
A postage stamp size place with only 7 tables, and about that many stools at the miniscule bar
Waiting for a table is par for the course
Also can get very loud, so not a good place for quiet conversation, but the perfect place for a great panini and down-home, first name basis service
But everything only adds to the atmosphere and that is what makes 'ino so unique - great food, fun people, cheap prices
great food w/high quality ingredients, a snug, romantic ambiance, and an amazing value
the host/waiter makes everyone feel like an old friend
what a gem!
Great Paninis Bruschetta
Great Value
Nice Ambiance - dim lighting, exposed brick walls
REALLY small, a little cramped, and crowded, but this problem is solved if you go during off-hours
Went here just before Christmas for the first time after hearing alot about this place
I wasn't disappointed at all
The panini's were among the best sandwich's I have had in the city and the wine list was great
I highly recommend the cheese plate too
Great inexpensive meal for lunch or for dinner
I highly recommend it
fun fun fun great service nice people highly recomend it
Me and 5 friends went here for our annual Holiday dinner and were blown away from the moment we walked in the door! We got lucky in that we were able to get a table within 30 minutes
The bartender and waiter were both attentive and very helpful
The food was absolutely amazing
We had apps, Brushetta, and panini and all were fabulous
The unique combination for the paninis made it very difficult to decide which one to eat
We were all pleasantly surprised
I highly recommend this place for great food at an unbelievable price!
A friend and I went here for brunch b/c we both heard so many good things about the place
To our disappointment,the waitress was very rude and inpatient with us
On top of this, when another customer spilled OJ all over my friend's food and clothes, the staff was very apathetic and rude in dealing with the situation
Furthermore, the food is over-rated and over-priced!!!! Skip this place and get a panini machine!!!
This is a great place to recharge the batteries with a glass of wine, a few cigarettes (thank God) and a delicious panini
Bring a good conversationalist and get there early or really late
Would sit in this little closet anytime! Truffle toast with asparagus worth an hour's wait
Solid wine list but the panini's are the main draw
Nice bar to sit at, too
Sweet, adorable staff
This place was a real treat
I tried half the crostinas and loved them all
All the dishes had fresh ingrediants and were very creative
This closet-sized little eatery has a great collection of wine, by the glass, carafe, and bottle
The wine is good, not too expensive
The food consisted of appetizers and appetizers, no real entrees
With a party of three, we had 2 bottles of wine, a cheese plate, three panini sandwiches, some bruschettas, and we were quite full and happy
for a date, dinner with a good friend, whatever
the antipasti platter is phenomonal
delicious salads and a great wine selection
very intimate setting
it's a great bargain too
too many damn beautiful people
even at lunch
even the staff
makes me sick
everything i have tried is great! keep getting platters etc
cuz i want it all! why did i find this place AFTER i changed jobs 12 blocks away? oh, did i reiterate what everyone else said? GREAT FOOD GREAT PRICES! hope it stays!!!
A wonderful slice of Europe on Bedford
Usually an annoying wait because word has gotten out but the steal of a cheese plate and antipasto are well worth it
Hoegardden on tap is an added bonus if you're not drinking from the well versed wine menu
Loved this place
Tiny and cramped, but who cares
The staff is friendly and warm
The food is delicious and there's a good wine list
This place makes you feel good
Plus, if you're a smoker the place is doubly dreamy
Best food, great wine and I love the staff
Couldn't ask for more
Salty meat, stinky cheese and crunchy bread
Sounds like a boring sandwich? Perhaps at other places, but not at 'ino
Once you try their sampler platter and get a selection of panino sandwiches, you'll kick yourself for not going to this place earlier
Get some prosecco, an olive appetizer and just eat away
Only drawback to the place? Super crowded every time I go
The Scene Mad scientists lurk in dark corners, concocting their next experiments--or is it your dinner? Suspend your disbelief and indulge your kids' curiosity for the dark side by entering the peculiar world of Jekyll    pizzas, burgers, salads and sandwiches
Kid faves include grilled cheese and, quite possibly, the biggest peanut butter and jelly sandwich in New York City
Specialty drinks--alcoholic and non--arrive in skull mugs or mini-canteens, nifty take-home souvenirs
I would watch out for the waitstaff bill, as it is a tourist-y restaurant
Our bill easily came to $120 for 3 people, we paid with a credit card
The waiter told us there were problems with the machine at that time, and they could only use cash
We paid him for the bill in cash, but were not given back the card
When we followed the waiter to get back the card, the Manager explained that their machine did work, but someone else's bill was charged on our card (total charge=$140)
The manager apologized and gave us back $20 for the difference, BUT THE WAITER NEVER RETURNED THE $120 CASH WE PAID
When we asked for the cash back
we had to argue with them for 5 minutes
I will never go there again, and definitely dont recommend it
For my guest's 1st night in New York, it was a horrible experience to feel you are being ripped off
Never go Back to this restaurant ever again too long waiting,too crowded seated next to a group of drunk and bad behavior and expliced language infront of my nephews
not respect at all
and managment told me i need to wait 45 mints more after i already waited 45 prior to be seated
too long to get our food not even drinks to start
Never again spend my money on this restaurant Bad Services
overall
We visited the Jekyll and Hyde Club on holiday
We had a rather large party of ten
The wait outside to get in was 45 minutes
The staff handed out complimentary hot chocolate
Waiting on the long line was absolutely worth it! Our kids had the best time of their entire holiday in this amazing restaurant
The server was all smiles and actually thanked us for waiting on line and explained all the different floors and their individual themes
The members walking around were witty-friendly and had our entire table laughing
The food was tasty with healthy size portions

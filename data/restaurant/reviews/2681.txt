The decor is full of celebrity autographs as well as sports memorablia
They have an upstairs catering hall for throwing awesome parties (buffet or sit -down dinners)
If you are looking for frills then this is not your place
But if you are interested in a nice good meal then I suggest you give the Crabhouse a try
The Scene Plunk this conventional, suburban-feel steakhouse into Manhattan, and it probably wouldn't survive a day for lack of anything chic or sleek
In Long Island City, however, its value and comfort are welcome
Nostalgic lodgey bric-a-brac adorns the livelier front dining room and bar, while the dim, non-smoking back room is decorated with stained glass and modern, Mission-style chairs
Service is almost overwhelmingly attentive
The Food Steaks are slightly blackened but done to perfection inside, each one thick and flavorful, if slightly fatty
A 16-ounce sirloin would satiate most, but ravenous meat-eaters can savor a 24-ounce ribeye, a gargantuan, 28-ounce porterhouse or, on Fridays and Saturdays, a king-cut prime rib
A heap of garlic mashed potatoes balances on the same plate, and a bubbly, cheese-topped crock of French onion soup fits right in
This steakhouse boasts to be the best in the city, which is hilarious! We had to wait almost 45 minutes to get our dinner
When the food finally arrived, we were totally disappointed
Ive never had such bland/tasteless food
We ended up paying so much for very mediocre dishes
It was like having a bad diner's food, with a $30 to $40 price tag per dish
If you want to dine in the area, you will probably be better off at the nearby Italian or French restaurants
The Scene The brightly lit dining room, with black metallic chairs and cookie-cutter Italian decor, may be short on charm, but the no-nonsense trattoria menu, and the friendly Manetta family who prepares and serves it, makes up for it in strides
On one side, cheese-and-dessert-stocked deli cases and a wood-fired pizza oven cater to a lively lunch crowd
On the other, families and groups of friends enjoy casual meals
The Food The Neapolitan-style pizzas--irregularly shaped, thin-crusted, char-crisped--are the main draw
Choose from more than a dozen oversized  personal pies, made with milky mozzarella and high-quality ingredients such as arugula, gorgonzola and prosciutto
Homemade pastas, like woodsy porcini pappardelle and a creamy four-cheese tagliatelle, are close seconds
Entrees are less exciting: The popular mixed grill holds chubby tenderloin, nondescript chicken breast and sweet sausage
Scooped tiramisu is worth the trip alone
If you need to get a chicken parm hero in LIC you've got to go here!! Biggest and tastiest parms around town
perhaps a dollar overpriced, but worth it I've had dinner here many times as well and all of the dinners have been very tasty
Pretty good wine list and the service is solid
Save some room for any of the deserts---- I usually switch off between the Italian Ricotta cheese cake and the flourless choclate cake
yummy pasta and pizza, the calamari is also very good
cute neighbourhood restaurant, I even went on Valentine's day
the cheesecake slices are small
The thin, delicate crust, and the wonderful subtle toppings
My God they make good pizza!
Wonderful place to stop in and enjoy the local queens ambiance, with a twist
The owner and some of the staff are Greek, some of the other staff are modern Queens, that is Quatemalan, Columbian, who knows where from the outer reaches of the world! Nonetheless, it is a great local diner with quality food, great price! Stop in and make it your daily breakfast or lunch stop
Always a great place to get take-out or delivery also!
Ordered delivery
Food was quick and hot but the quality was my biggest disappointment
Sauce was week and there was way too much cheese
Maybe I just won't find a slice her in LIC like I did back in Brooklyn
This tiny place has great burgers
Fresh ground beef
Under $5 for burger and fries
Grilled chicken very good as well
Take-out only: no tables
Food in this place is very good
I like the sandwiches and mezze platters
Most of the dishes on the menu are also very well priced
There's also a huge selection of mojitos and cca 20+ martini-type cocktails
The only problem is the service which was disappointing on each visit (I've been there three times already)
That's quite sad because the place is so nice and could be very successful
It's an amazing neighborhood spot with cozy atmosphere usually filled with very good music and interesting local crowd
Classic french bake shop, looks like the production kitchen for some of those high end sweets you gat at Four Star CHIC Places on Madison Ave up near the Met
High Quaility desserts
and till 'bout 1P
M
they sell breakfast specials like eggs bacon that are agreat value
Wineturtle loves to coffee,rollread from the communial stack of mags and books and ethnic papers the customers bring
A sweet treat in the nabe
High End Sweets
The food is pretty standard diner fare - but the cheeseburgers are really huge for the reasonable $5 price
The doughnuts are alwasy fresh and much better than anything from a chain
But the real gem is the staff and the locals who hang out there
I was on friendly terms with everyone by only my second visit
So sit at the counter and discover this little neighborhood jewel
I moved to the area 6 months ago and was excited to have a 24-hour eatery nearby
Unfortunately, I have to say that the service here is TERRIBLE
The waiters are rude and disrepectful
Though the food usually comes out fairly quickly, the order is wrong half of the time
Don't bother complaining because the managers are just as rude
Do yourself a favor and try Mikes Diner or the Igloo on Ditmars, or The Bel-Aire Diner (my personal favorite) instead
The burgers are everything you dream of in a burger and the fries are heaven
The service is attentive and the place is super clean
The Bel-Aire cannot measure up
Oh, the breakfasts are great and plentiful and the spinach pie made my mouth water
Went for dinner: Great food, decent service, and excellent location (perfect via driving or N train)
Read the other reviews before I went
For diner fare (and even many average restaurants), the food is remarkably good! Yes, the portions are big
Our waiter may be considered minimalistic to brusque, but he was competent
Honestly, I don't go to diners expecting 4-star waitstaff and treatment: the waiter was decently efficient, that's all I expect
I would definitely go back again and eager to try their breakfasts
The portions are HUGE and the food is great
staff is very attentive
I love the tuna melt
Their salads are very large!! Never had a bad meal there (and usually need to take a doggybag)
All right, this diner used to be Best Diner in the City
It's right off the Triboro, everyone sees it, and it's not as good as you think
I used to sing it's praises, and then I had some very poor service on several occasions and I found a better diner, which is the new Best Diner in the City The Bel-Aire on 21st St
and Broadway
Ir's what this place should be
I was quite disappointed that the best diner in Queens was anything but! My chicken sandwich was Chicken on bread
nada mas! Perhaps I'll get the burger next time! The service was less than nice
Yes, no one can make a better feta cheese ommelette than Neptune Diner! I lived in Astoria for 2 years and believe me, I have tried many diners in Queens and never had a tastier omellette
Also I recommend the cheesecake with strawberries
The food is consistently good, they are open for 24 hours and the servers are friendly
What else can you expect from a Greek Diner?
I'm not exactly sure how much food the previous reviewer needs to be satisfied but skimpy portions are not a complaint you'll have when you eat at this place
The decor is OK - clean and occasionally campy
The servers are casual but still quite attentive

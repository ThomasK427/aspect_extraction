Great food, great decor and a great environment right in the center of the meatpacking district
We loved it!
I went to Nero last week for my b-day dinner and it was not the best choice
The food was honestly the worst all 8 of us have had in NYC in a long time
I ordered the scallops which where chewy so my dinner consisted of 1 scallop
Some friends ordered the risotto which was very bland and was not appealing at all
The service was below average for a new restaurant, we practically had to flag our waiter down to get the check
Overall, I had a nice time because I was with my friends, but will never go to Nero again
Very creative Med and reasonably priced
Great looking cosmo crowd
You can combine a night out of dinning and bar scene
Highly recommended
In Short Highly respected chef Mina Azad helped open this Bangladeshi restaurant, and though she has since relocated to Spicy Mina in Queens, her former digs remains an anchor of Sixth Street's ongoing culinary comeback
Christmas lights and mirrored walls are nowhere to be found, replaced with modern light fixtures and exposed brick
On the menu, unusual offerings like mango salad, Kashmiri chicken and whole fish cooked in mustard sauce refute the strip's infamous reputation for one-sauce-fits-all cooking
Had a late lunch there two days ago with my boyfriend
We ordered the samosa and then the vegetable pakora for appetizers
And the Kashmiri chicken and malai kofta and naan for the main course
Delicious!! I have never had tastier malai kofta - good enough to melt in the mouth!! And the portions were huge! After stuffing ourselves silly we still had enough for a second meal
Adorable restaurant
Pleasant ambiance and wonderful aromas fill this roomy restaurant
Tables are not butting up against each other, food is superb
Lamb is tender and all dishes are seasoned well
Authentic Indian dishes from a cheerfully family owned restaurant
Best Indian food in town
Great service and food!  Definately will return
The Scene The wrought iron fence encircling this corner restaurant only hints at its slightly goth interior
Renderings of mythical creatures festoon its walls, and heavily tattooed waitresses pick up orders from the open kitchen and chat at the small bar
The clientele, as mixed as the neighborhood, gathers in groups in the spacious back room
The Food Beast is not a conventional tapas bar
Generous servings are piled on small plates, and eclectic house specialties outshine the traditional Spanish dishes--like the overly eggy tortilla
Try the complimentary flatbread--seasoned with a heavy hand--chewy, charred, and addictive, and breaded and fried Manchego, a clever spin on mozzarella sticks
Ribs braised in Guinness fall off the bone, and luxurious seared scallops pair well with the Italian Fiano, a soft white wine with honeyed fruit flavors
Finish with a rich chocolate pot de creme or, better yet, grilled baby bananas with homemade pistachio ice cream
This place is just confusing
The evening we visited that bar area was overwhelmingly loud- head-banger loud
When we were shown to our table we were shocked to walk into an entirely different world- too few tables, zero ambiance, and thankfully- no Quiet Riot
The food was enjoyable, but over priced for Brooklyn tapas- especially given the lack of ambiance
There are much more enjoyable neighborhood places than this one
The portabella and the venison are divine; the pistachio icecream and banana dessert is the stuff dreams are made of
Keeping in mind it's a tapas restaurant, the portions are more than adequate
Complaints about size might be due to ignorance regarding tapas
Something mammoth? Try the Beast's burger
It's too large to finish if you plan to button your jeans afterwards
The decor and lighting is lovely
It's perfect for dates and hanging with friends
Very moody
The music is also great! I was thrilled to find that Beast's play list is exactly what's on my ipod
The staff are not only friendly and knowledgeable but somehow everyone there is attractive too
Enjoy the eye candy while feasting on great tapas in a fun restaurant with the perfect music
ok This place is good but definetly not a 9
The cheese platter was tasty and overpriced
the grilled sardines sank
I love the flatbread but I'm a carb fiend
Bread is always good
It's not good for kids
There are no children's selection on the menu and its a bar
There was a high chair but even my very upscale ten year old could find nothing to please his palate forget about my 6,3 and 2 year old nephews
If you miss this one-oh well
A Brooklyn must-visit
New American tapas-like plates, crafted and delivered in a pub-like atmoshpere
The short, reasonable wine-list is well-chosen
The house-baked flat-bread is to die for
The skirt-steak can't be beat
If you seek a hibernation-inducing finish to your feast, pair the toffee pudding with an Italian amaro
The service can be too casual and specifically wants staff-guidance when it comes to ordering
The menu is slightly confusing, sorted by Earth, Sea and Sky
Though the poetry is not lost, the roast seasonal vegetables would have paired better with our hot course than they did with the house-cured olives with which we started
All in all a great experience and though the location is off the beaten path, when you walk through the heavy, wooden door a warm reception is the welcome you've earned for chosing the road less travelled by
I went last night and was very surprised with how the food tasted and how good the service was
Order the steak, it is very good
Other notable items are the shrimp, vegetable dish and short ribs
This place is a must try
I thought the menu looked appealing
Then the meal came
Four shrimp for dinner! Sure it was only $12 which sounds cheap but four shrimp are not dinner
I was embarrassed that i picked this place
The tuna- again- a ridiculously small portion for dinner
It is not served with anything
You will leave starving and while they claim it is outdoors, you'll be eating in the street if you choose to sit outside
Not a nice setting at all
Skip this place
Even trying to get a glass of wine was hard
It is served in a quartet
a glass and a half at a high price
So stupid
A terrible experience
I have absolutely no complains about the wonderful food, everything we tasted was nearly perfect
The problem is the bar
The bar staff here has no clue about making drinks
I took some European guests here the other weekend for early snacks and cocktails
They wanted to try a bloody mary, a rarity in Europe, and what we got was a vodka and tomato juice with a splash of worcestire sauce
All of the other ingredients were missing, they had no clue
I am a fan of vodka, so I didn't complain, but when I asked for a vodka soda with lemon I got a huge vodka with a tiny splash of soda and a lime
Again, wrong! I recommend that you order the fabulous food and stick to beer, wine and straight up drinks, until they train their bartenders properly
Don't get me wrong though, I will be back
I ve been keeping track of reviews of beast since i'm such an avid fan, and i still see people saying the portions are small, but
HELLO
its tapas! And actually if you ARE familiar with tapas you would know from your first course, that the Beast tapas are freakin' huge
The ingredients are fresh and despite running out of a couple things from time to time, it is probably the best meal in brooklyn

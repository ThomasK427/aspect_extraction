Food is usually fairly good, but not worth the hurdles of door-staff attitude and slow service that you have to go through
On one occassion, I waited a good 15 minutes after being seated to order
On another, the seating person responded to a request for waiting time estimate by questioning whether if was my first time there and said that if I didn't like the wait maybe this isn't the right place for you
I found this extremely rude, especially as I had been quietly waiting for over 30 minutes (although initially being told it would be a 15 min
wait)
Do not plan on returning
Luckily, there are plenty of other restaurants in the UWS with food that is equally good or better so I won't be missing much
They win the hot chocolate crown hands down
But they have an amazing drink list
The best service and a great menu of delicious food
I was lucky enough to be greeted by the chef's wife-who chatted for a few minutes about the tantalizing deserts they have
Naturally, she wanted us to try some of them
We were very thankful she did
From beginnings to ends a meal at SQC is well worth it
Evaluated both the negative positive feedback on this place before deciding to take a chance on holding a strictly cocktails network mixer for 25 people there
ON 24 HOURS NOTICE
I'm thrilled to say that my choice--guided by location ambiance ALONE -- proved to be a winner on the service and drinks front, as well
Management accommodated us beautifully pleasantly in the 'atrium' bar area, the drinks were well-mixed (though not inexpensive), and the staff (much maligned in some reviews) actually seemed to know what they were doing
BRAVO
our group will be BACK!!!
I've eaten here for the last time
We were seated promptly, and ordered, never to see our wine until the appetizers arrived
The white wine was warmer than room temperature
They said there was no chilled white wine and they were trying to chill it
We switched ordered a bottle of red instead
When the bill came, the waiter snatched it back so he could add the $3 difference to the wine
And there went the waiter's tip to pay for the wine
the food and drinks were amazing, but the service was a bit slow
smaller portions, but really good
I agree that SQC has the best hot chocolate around, hands down
The key to this restaurant is not going during the crazy-packed brunch weekend hours, when hordes of people swarm the place
If you go during the week or in the evening, the restaurant has a distinct charm and the food is delicious
The chef has a great touch with making classics his own - I've sampled the menu many times and there's always a special touch that makes the dishes excel
Plus the decor is lovely, especially in the front windows where you can lounge on pillows with friends, specialty martinis in hand
I completely agree with jzderf below
The only redeeming feature of this place is that it has best hot chocolate in NYC
The ambience isn't bad either, so just set aside an hour (because that seriously is how long it will take), sit back and enjoy your liquid chocolate deliciousness, then go somewhere else for dinner
@SQC probably has THE weirdest service I have experienced in a mid/upscale restaurant
The staff was always pleasant and friendly, but they seemingly have no idea on actually how to BE waitstaff
They were frantic and missing when the restaurant was relatively empty on our 5pm Sunday visit
We were seated prompty, but it took us 15 minutes just to get our menus
When attempting to get our check, it took us another 15 minutes just to flag down ANY waitstaff (since our waittress was seemingly gone) and after getting the check, we needed change
We got our change - in addition to a 2nd bill from someone who had ordered the same items as us (???)
It even had their AMEX number on it!  Also, most of the items on the menu are pretty overpriced in terms of what you get
The hot chocolate is worth it though
i took a bunch of friends to SQC for brunch and we were all very disappointed
besides the long wait the staff was unattentive and unfriendly, the food overpriced
many guests were complaining about the cold draft coming in from the door
there are so many good brunch places in the neighborhood that i wouldn't come here again
I am not sure if this was just an off night or what, our waiter forgot wine, brought us desert menus before dinner came, then brought us the wrong dinner
Pretty bad experience overall
SQC is one of the cooler spots on the UWS to have a bite to eat and a drink
The decor reminds me of Finnish-Japanese with the oyster shell floors and Scandanavian wood, the warm lighting and subdued mood
It's very calming and the food and drinks never disappoint
Chef Campbell is very talented, his dinner and brunch menus are filled with terrific dishes
I love his ribs, his seafood soups, and all the desserts
SQC is great in the evening, the light is excellent and it's perfect to sit at the bar, eat oysters on the half shell and have a glass of wine
I keep coming back because he and his wife Linda, who operates the front of the house, are so welcoming and wonderful
I would rather go hang out with them then go to any of the other impersonal places in the area
The brunch here is really good, but I wasn't impressed with the dinner menu
The waitstaff here is VERY STRANGE
None of them seem trained, and all seem to be busboys
They hung out behind my chair as I ate
Compared to numerous fantastic restaurants in the city, within the same price range, @SQC is completely overrated
I've been for both brunch and dinner and neither are anything to rave about
Brunch
there are so many better spots on the Upper West that are comparable in price and service
Sarabeth's, Good Enough to Eat, Time Cafe
Dinner, the food is ok, but again, very overpriced
Appetizers, entrees, and a bottle of wine for 2 was $150
While very few people in the area could direct me to the restaurant's location, once inside it was an excellent dining experience
From a great bread selection to start, exceptional appetizers, great entrees (beef tenderloin quite tasty), to incredible deserts, it was an overall very good dining experience
Don't forget to order desserts
Not to mention, the presentation matches the quality of the outstanding food selection
The food here is very inventive, which is totally different from other UWS joints
Try the pumplkin ravioli and the fried calamari with this excellent dipping sauce
The cod fish is good for those watching their figures
But don't leave without trying the desserts, with homemade ice cream! Really excellent!  Con: The place is quite small, so be ready to strike up a conversation with people sitting almost on top of you
Also, make sure you bring limble people
I came here with my parents who both have back and knee problems, and getting up and down those very NARROW stairs to the bathroom was not easy
The prices are not cheap, nevertheless, I enjoyed my experience here and would reccommend it
I had a wonderful dining experience at @SQC
The food was delicious and the service impeccable
I would recommend it to anyone
Not sure what the bad reviews are about
my girlfriend and I both agreed the brunch was excellant! Service was actually better than normal
We were a bit surprised at the bill ($50
00 w/ tip), since we didn't go crazy w/ the Bloody's or Mimosa's
Get the eggs w/ roasted tomatos! Overall, we enjoyed it immensely though
The Scene A New England beach house has run ashore in Hell's Kitchen, with uptown residents and in-the-know theatergoers drifting in for an evening of casual class
Warm, sandy hues wash over the lofty, low-lit space and its classic white-painted woods--though the full transporting effect is marred by hit-or-miss service and glass walls exposing gas station scenery
The Food Conjuring that seaside vacation are diet-spoiling comfort foods--with the same high hotel price tags
Start off right with thick, crisp-edged blue crab fritters and the sweet persimmon salad, a synthesis of taste and texture with soft blue cheese, toasted walnuts, and crunchy pomegranate seeds
Mushroom turkey meat loaf and macaroni and cheese are favored by those raised on similar recipes, but the cheddar-heavy elbow noodles are lackluster and the old-fashioned tomato sauce adds an odd molasses twang
Opt instead for luxurious lobster dishes like the vanilla-flushed butter sauce casserole--which is dessert enough, and more pleasing than the ho-hum closers
We had a birthday party of 10 recently
My wife was using the restroom on the 1st floor when suddenly a male patron opened the door
They were both caught surprised, especially my wife being totally embarrassed and scared
The man yelled Oh my God, she didn't lock the door! Note that my wife did lock the door and double checked as any woman would do
She then complained to the hostess, but to no avail

You will have to wait for a table though, and get shooed out once finished
But it's worth it
Friendly staff too and clean kitchen
TIP: if you know what you want when you get there, save the waitstaff the time of going through their extensive specials list
it takes about 5 minutes
All of you people complaining about the wait need to shut up! It is a small place and it's in the village so get over it! This is one of the best authentic Mexican places in the city and it is worth the wait! The salsa is extraordinary and they make the best mole I have ever tasted
Good things come to those who wait!
Amazing food, cozy atmosphere and aaaaaamazing salsa
The salsa is not chunky, but a puree of tomato, spice other wonderful things
I fell in love with this tiny restaurant and the view from the windows the first time I was here
Their specials and salsas are wonderful and the care taken with presentation, service, and exceptional quality of ingredients is wonderful
I've never had a soup, chicken, or fish of the day I didn't really enjoy and the margaritas are really yummy
Their flan is different and better than any I've had and despite the long wait, their coffee is worth making a few people angry for
Note: cash only
Mexicana Mama consistently satisfied my craving for Truly, Authentic Mexican Food
It's the only place in town that I found Chihuahua cheese as an active ingredient
That's just one example of the unique traditional Mexican flavors that the delicious menu boasts
It's worth the wait, tight seating and the money
If you're expecting Americanized, i
e
, diluted Mexican taste - go elsewhere
This hole in the wall in the west village prides itself in the best guacomole in town and the best mexican by far, well, if you enjoy very spicy food in small portions, and want to sit on uncomfortable seats, it is the place for you! The food was too spicy to taste, it seemed good, the margaritas were good too!
The best guacamole in town! The food and service were great
You may need to wait a while but it's worth it!
If you like spice, this is your kinda joint
Those who prefer to walk on the mild side couldn't help but wince at the overabundance of heat in everything served
Translate heat into hot spiciness
My chicken special was tasty after scraping the poblano chile sauce that was zestily poured over it, obliterating all the other flavors initially described by our waitress
I don't know, I couldn't get over the guacamole which seared my taste buds
Same goes for the cheese appetizer
Does the menu come with a non-spicy option?
A word to the wise: don't come here on a date, especially on the weekend, when the strolling mariachi band plays so loud you can barely hear a thing
But do come for birthdays, as the owners will gladly pour tequila down your throat and serenade you with happy songs
This restaurant seems promising with its oversized shrine to Sophia Loren
There's ample outdoor seating to view the street traffic on bustling Bleeker St
Unfortunately the food at this tourist trap couldn't even trap a bear in winter
I've had TV dinners that were fresher and more appealing
Salads were wilted and soggy with tasteless dressing
The calamari appetizer was nothing more than greasy pencil erasers drizzled in tuna oil
The pasta was petrified like year old Twizzlers drenched in butter and canned Parmesan cheese
There was absolutely nothing worthwhile about this worthless travesty
Terrible food, surly service, and though the prices are not steep, youd be better off at the Wendys around the corner
Positively forgettable if it werent for the shockingly unacceptable quality of the food
This quirky little place has got to be the smallest restaurant in the city, but still one of the best for dining alone
The place is small, but the portions are full sized
For $10 you get a basket of bread, a salad, and a main dish with two sides
The counter top makes you feel like you're in a French lunchtime bistro in Paris or in an Edward Hopper painting
The food is good too
The Scene Wood tables and green walls make for an environment that feels part rainforest, part kitschy cafeteria
Quirks like the series of mismatched chandeliers and the public address system at the counter (over which takeout orders are shouted in Chinese) lend charm
Service is unusually amiable; stop by to pick up a lunch order and a host, most likely, will offer you a glass of water and ask you to take a seat
The Food This Chinese menu features fresh-tasting dishes from across China's map
Highlights include the huge Cantonese noodle soups, hot garlic chicken, herb-laced basil beef, prawns with Chinese zucchini and crispy whole sea bass
The Szechuan wontons, which are served in a rich beef stock and accompanied by a fiery wasabi-spiked peanut sauce, are stellar, as are tangy pork spare ribs
Start with a bowl of steamed edammame
I'm lucky to have this palce as a neighbor to my job! I'm strict vegetarian, so eating in west village is usually unfulfilling
Ma Ma Buddha has lots of vegetarian dishes like Tofu atop watercress leaves, Stir-fried green leafy mixed vegetables (a trio of different types of bok choy in a light clear sauce) and others
They are never drenched in a heavy sauce
It's a great place to dine alone
Midday, there are always available tables and lone diners
The refills of tea and water are constant, and you always get a fortune cookie + fruit slices with your check
The servers are friendly and cute, though they are a bit quiet
The lunch special is a great value, but the rest of the menu itself is also very affordable
And the windows along the corner of 11th and hudson ofer a great view of what's going on outside
We have tried this place several times
The food in this place is okay
If you need a quick meal to satisfy your hunger this is the place to be
The service is excellent
In a minute everything will be served
In fact so quick, when you take your last bite the check is already on the table
No desserts in this place, but no need for that, since the fortune cookie and slices of fruit come with the check!
So I've been to Ma Ma Buddha at least 15 times and not once can I say that they were ever having an off night
Food great, service outstanding
This is not a fancy place nor one with bullet proof anything
Bring your friend(s) and be happily surprised at this place
At the end of your meal they bring a fortune cookie and an orange or pineapple slice
That's neat!
This is the second best Chinese food restaurant in all of NYC! Try the orange chicken - oh yea it's full of saturated fat and calories, but the dish is a religious experience
Its conveniently located about 10 min walk S
of Chelsea
This place rocks
When I'm out pub crawling, quenching my thirst at local waterholes and find myself hankering for some quality asian that ain't gonna bust the bank, my crawling takes me here
The service is so good and, my God, so unbelievably quick! Try the szechuan dumplings, or the chili squid, or even beef with tofu
And, the g d green tea! So good it's free
Try it and you won't be disappointed
Do not confuse Ma Ma Buddha with so many others with similiar names, this place is a treasure trove of Fresh Vegetables and at least 90 waitresses
It's good, it's very, very good
In Short Spanish senoritas painted on the walls lend an air of the Mediterranean to this eatery
Customers can share a selection of tapas or choose their own entrees while splitting a pitcher of sangria
The vegetable paella, served hot with carrots, is a popular lunchtime item; the menu boasts a variety of red and white Spanish wines
We heard that El Faro serves some of the best Spanish dishes in the city and we decided to give it a try
My wife and I were seated promptly
Our orders were taken and served accordingly
The house bread and salad were average, the sangria was very good and the paella is excellent
However, the dining area is small and can get quite noisy
The dcor is not that great either and needs some work
In terms of service, we noticed that the other diners, when they are about to finish their meals, are systematically rushed through their dinners
You would see the waiters walking back and forth and putting the pressure on the diners
I would like to agree with the other reviewer mentioning that the wait staff can be indifferent and rude
Overall, I would say this place has good drinks, good food but a bad place to hang out even for a short conversation with your friends

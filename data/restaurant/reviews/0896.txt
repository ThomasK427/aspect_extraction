after dinner, we jumped down to the bar and were very pleased with it
overall, the service was excellent, as was the food
if ur looking for something interesting for desert, check out the matchu sticks
the only downside was we were asked if we wanted still or sparkling water, but unfortunately, this meant if we wanted to purchase a $9, 1/2 liter bottle
it was quite the shock when we recieved our bill
if this seems ridiculous to you, opt for the tap water
otherwise, highly reccomended
side note: upstairs, there is a very interesting bathroom, with lots of buttons to play with
To start, the drinks are awful
We sent two back and then moved on to sake
The sakes are all seriously overpriced
Food is mediocre, except for Mushroom Custard and Foie Gras in Fire Ice
Room is cold and overblown
Watch out for smokers going outside- the doors leading outside subject part of the room to freezing temps
Management is snooty and most staff try really hard, but there isn't much to work with
Only for the trendy
i ate here with a friend by default-- we were in the meatpacking district on a saturday night, every place in the area was pretty much booked, we were hungry, i only drink sake, and he was treating :)
the decor was definitely impressive-- attractive, elegant
however, the food was only above average
the sushi was decent, the big plates were eatable, the skewers only okay
we wanted the kobe carpaccio, but got the beef cooked wrapped around an asparagus spear
we though carpaccio meant uncooked! we ate it anyway, but overall, we were definitely not impressed
as prices go, i would go elsewhere for better sushi at the same price
Huge plates, they call them large plates but they are like Flinstones Plates! Great grill, interesting starters and unique sushi
They have this topped sushi which the server said does not need soy sauce
The sushi comes out like canapes, ready to eat and seasoned with little toppings like marinades and dices etc
The drinks are way overpriced ($12 for a stoli tonic) but all told the prices were in line with most fine dining spots
By the way, the bartneders and waiters were amazing, very friendly and they knew so much about everything without hestitation, it was surprising
We didn't expect the service to be as mom and pop friendly in a glam meat packing sushi spot
We live in the neighborhood so this was a must try
The food was OKAY, the ambience disney world like and the service friendly
The sushi was the true let down
The robata items were fairly good
Typical of this type of overwhelming space without any warmth, nor the food to brind you back again
I still say jewel bako for sushi, and hopefully for their version of robato
The Scene A long, white tunnel transports A-listers and well-heeled wait-listers to midtown's highly buzzed-about scene
With honeycomb-patterned walls, cavernous booths and white-glass bar, design-guru Marc Newsom evokes futurism and nostalgia all at once
The focal point is an elevated, trapezoidal cutout behind which not-so-private parties unfold
The young, black-clad servers and knowledgeable managers pamper with pleasure
The Food Dan Silverman's down-to-earth New American cooking brings welcome gravity
Shining starters include orange-scallion marinated fluke tartare fragrant with ginger; crisp-fried lobster claws dipped into transcendent tartar sauce; and green-market genius, like pickled peaches with seared Sullivan county foie gras and fresh Romano-tossed beans
Entrees are surprisingly elemental: roast lamb with minty fava-arugula salad, well-prepared risottos and grill highlights, including sirloin with crisp, braised artichokes and rare tuna with beet-ginger chutney
Deborah Snyder's desserts impress, especially American-centric sweets like fig cake with sweet corn ice cream
I've been to the Lever House many times over the last two years and was finally compelled to write a review
It made a seemless transition from being uber-hip and hot to being one of the great restaurants in Manhattan
The food and service have never been better
Sure the decor is pretty but the food is the real star here
I can't recommend it enough!
I went here for a birthday dinner with my family when they were over from London, so was looking for something special
The ambience was great, very sophisticated, and the food was good, although not excellent
The service, however, was appalling, given that it was quite possibly the most expensive meal I've ever eaten
The waiter was cocky and overly flirtatious to the point of rudeness, and failed to refill anyone's glasses with wine or really use any common sense at all
A shame, because otherwise it would have been a great evening
Great cocktails though!
Came here a couple months ago, really enjoyed the dining experience
Ambience is very cool, however, feels stiff b/c u can tell most people that come are for business reasons or have $$$
However, even with the upscale crowd, the staff is very friendly and great and the food was delicious! had the beef cheeks which i recommend if u like red meat
overall a great place to eat american cuisine, however, it is pricey (but worth it) and the crowd is upscale but not snooty
love the way the place looked too
The decor definitely brings to the restaurant's appeal
The tunnel entrance, which kinda gives the feel of a run way, opens up to a great dining hall with mood lighting and modern decor
The wait staff is very courteous and the food, if you pick the right entrees can be worth the price
I forget what I had because I guess it was just that, forgettable
My boyfriend was very happy with his dining experience
I took suggestions from the waitress, which most times gives great results, but I guess this time she and I weren't on the same wavelength
Definitely a trendy place if you want to people watch among a crowd of mainly late 30s and 40-50 somethings
Don't get me wrong, I would definitely go back and want to bring my girlfriends
Worth the time and money
just be ready to spend a good amount
I had heard great things about this restaurant from colleagues
Unfortunately, I found the service below par for this level ($$) of restaurant
Simply put, the wait staff was friendly but lacked finesse
Two glasses were knocked over by the waiter and attendant and my guest was asked three times if he was finished with his meal
Hopefully management will review this and step it up
The decor and food were great
I felt as if James Bond may pass my table at anytime
I'll give it another try
but most savvy NYC diners wouldn't
From the moment we entered Lever House everything was extraordinary
The friendliness of the staff, the decor, food, wine selection, value were all superb
For appetizers try the tuna carpaccio with wasabi creme fraiche, lobster tempura with tarter sauce
You will not be disappointed
Then for the entrees, try the lobster tails and rack of lamb
The cote de boeuf for two is delicious
For sides, the spinach, haricots verts and broccoli raab were all winners
For dessert try the warm cookies, chocolate-coffee bombe and peanut butter parfait
WOW! What a meal
The wine list is great also
The room is spectacular - couldn't take my eyes off the design all night
The food was pretty amazing - there was a duck appetizer with an outstanding sauce, and a grapefruit-caramel dessert which is unbelievable weird and delicious - a true original, a must have
It's a neat place!
Ambience was great
Service commendable
The food was not good
The shrimp appetizer was odd in flavor and texture
A bit mushy and awkwardly paired with the pasty and flavorless chick pea hummus
My husbands sirloin was dry and tough
The grilled lobster was terrible
Two small, unimpressive lobster tails set atop a brew of tomato based stewed root vegetables
Yes, even as I write this I am reminded how inappropriate and disturbing the pairing of lobster and stewed vegetables really is! The desserts were ok

" The Bloomin' Onion, a large onion dipped in batter and deep-fried, is an appetizer with a following
This is the only Outback at which I've ever eaten that actually has PRIME cuts of beef on their menu
The steak is seasoned, seared and cooked to perfection and, if they ever happen to overcook it by accident, they'll cheerully take it back and replace it without hesitation (happened to me only once in about 30 visits over the past year)
The wait staff is generally excellent and well trained, although one or two have fallen through the cracks
Note: be wary of the general manager if your girlfriend is well endowed, as he will likely become inappropriate toward her
Their steaks are by far the best value in NYC: not only are their steaks the tastiest, but with all the fixin's, they cost half what the other popular steak houses are charging, as they come full menu with salad, vegetable and bread, rather than a la carte
Make sure to order their steamed vegetables with your meal as they are cut fresh daily and cooked with a secret recipe worthy of angels
Their salads are fantastic and come with fabulous croutons prepared and cooked on premises, also on a daily basis
You will not have the atmosphere of Sparks, Blair Perrone's or Smith and Wolensky's (I have never seen unattended children run through those establishments like they were playgrounds, for instance), but obnoxious over-paid jewelry-laden Rappers and their loud entourages won't be slumming at a reasonably priced restaurant like the Outback, either
Highly recommended
On a recent visit to this restaurant, it seemed that there was some kind of problem with the heat
We could practically see our breath in the restaurant! Even the waiters were walking around shivering
When we complained to the manager, he assured us that he would turn the heat
What happened? It only got colder
I was so cold I could barely taste my food
which I guess was a good thing, since it was so awful
The prime filet was rubbery and over-seasoned, the ribs were cold and salty, and the french fries were limp and soggy
This place is the best right down to the salad dressing
The waiter was very friendly and we were served very fast
Definitely a great place to dine in thecity
Friends I have been to this Outback about 15 times this year
Always good service, always awesome food
Cheap drinks beer
Waitress actually talks to you
Great place to go out before you go out for the night
No outside seating though
Manager has stopped by almost always to check up
Feels like the Outbacks at home
If those of you are religious to Citysearch like me - Outback should def be on your Sun-Thurs list before going out list
I had the WORST dining experience here ever while with boyfriend and parents
First, the waitress forgot drinks and finally arrived 25 minutes later with two flat sodas
When soup arrived, it was cold
Ten minutes later, the microwaved french onion soup returned only to be LUKEWARM!! We sent it back again, and it was then we realized 1) our bread never arrived, and 2) our free re-fills were never refilled
ALL THIS AGITA was compounded by the fact that everytime the door to this bat cave opens, it shudders througout the entire restaurant with a THUD
Two of us likened the sound to that of a car backfiring
Finally, we spoke to the 20 y/o manager about the hellacious service, all he gave us were bloomin' onion coupons - as if this country isn't fat enough! E-mail me for the coupon - I'll never return there!
Really great service
The Manager even came over and asked us how things were going
I don't think you can beat $2 drafts during Lunch
Everybody loves Outback but nobody really knows about this Outback so there is hardely ever a wait
I would get in now before people realize its there
They have prime steak so its the same thing as Wollensky but for half the price with sides
The service was great
I would reccomend it to everyone
My girlfriends and I went there for happy hour and then stayed for dinner and it was delicious
Youre wasting your money at a rip off steakhouse for the same steak and better service
FINALLY AN OUTBACK IN MANHATTAN!!
Ziggys is the kind of place where you can hang by yourself on a lazy Sunday morning and read the paper while sipping on a hot latte made with love by the funky and fun staff
Great games, groovy music and soothing lighting make this place perfect for those who want to *feel* like they're at home
And, the coffee is amazing!
Did you ever want to leave home, but feel like you are in your own living room? Ever want to play a round of Scrabble with strangers who end up becoming you friends
if so come to Ziggies
The staff helps you feel at home
plus you can eat well and relax for hours and now you can even relax with wine and beer
Ziggie is the man
As the new kid on the block I found ziggie's cafe a friendly place with great Italian coffee
I recommend the sandwiches and the pastries
The Scene Vintage suitcases and black-and-white photos of old ocean liners evoke the Golden Age of travel in the front bar, where a worldly clientele sips cocktails around a flickering faux fireplace
Tucked into a tiny dining room with chocolate-colored satin walls and linen-cloaked tables, diners delight in sophisticated, pampering service
The Food The travel motif extends to the globe-trotting menu, where soulful fusion fare comforts, rather than complicates
The American South is the thematic center, richly apparent in tender truffled scallops with red-eye gravy grits, and luscious deep-dish shrimp and crawfish spoonbread
Start with coconut curry-fried oysters, creamy oxtail croquettes in bacon jus and spicy shrimp enlivened by avocado parfait
Entrees, such as succulent zinfandel-braised short ribs, sweet-sour snapper with capers and full-flavored crispy chicken with herbed dumplings, are best followed by chocolate-drenched angel food cake
After waiting 40 minutes between courses, I could not bring myself to eat the entree
The waitress concocted a novice excuse as to the long wait claiming the salmon takes time to prepare
Finally, I see our two entrees emerge from the kitchen
They were definitely ours since all occupied tables had been served
The server trips, the salmon smacks the floor
He scoops it up, dashes into the kitchen
I thought, Great, it'll take 40 minutes for a new salmon! Just minutes later, the server appears at our table with the same entrees
Possible they just happened to have an extra 40-minute salmon dish on standby? Possible
Possible I mistakenly ordered Roasted Linoleum Salmon? Probable
I didn't chance it
I didn't touch it
After my fellow diner finished his very average chicken, we made a quick voyage out never to return to such a faux-glamour pit
Absolutely true story
Once what was my most favorite brunch place in all of New York has within a month spiraled into an abomination
As my friends and I said its as if one Sunday jokesters said let's open a restaurant this afternoon and see how far we can push the limits on horrendous service then get people to pay us for it
In 36 years of dining out in New York I have never had worse service
Burger King has better help that this dump
It was sad to see two other tables getting up and walking out after being seated then forgotten
I had good company to take my mind off of the idiots running the show
I will admit - the chef can turn out solid dishes
AVOID THIS DUMP!
i wanted to like this restaurant as my friend had recommended it
the waiter was extremely nice, but the service was horrible
our drinks came so late, dishes were not cleared, food was brought to the table and we had to repeatedly ask for cutlery for 1 person
the place was not busy either so we just joked that the waiter was hung over because he was so forgetful
the food was blah
my short ribs was overly sweet
the cod was bland
would not recommend
A charming, uniquely designed restaurant / bar hidden on a small street without the attitude at so many other places
Beautifully designed room, nice upfront bar/lounge area for having good conversation with excellent cocktails
Food was very good but less consistent than cocktail menu
The garlic shrimp appetizer was incredible (5 jumbo shrimp in an amazing sauce)
The zinfandel-braised short ribs were delicious but a bit to fatty for my taste
The salmon entree was very good but unexceptional
Hostess was very gracious, waiter very friendly but a bit unattentive
With all the nonsense and pretense happening in the far West Village, Voyage remains an oasis

Finally they didn't bring any change for the bill
great atmosphere, mixed crowd, cute decor
Servers are a bit curt
Definitely order appetizers, eat 'em THEN order dinner
Can't beat the value! A bit too dark to read the menu though
Great for groups but parking is a pain!
Depending on days, you get good and bad servings
The service is always horrible
no manners and always rude
Not expensive at all and good environment
We go for the fab atmosphere cheap eats, but that's about it
The food is average at best
It always has been
Do yourself a favor: order your appetizers ONLY first
They will arrive at your table in less than 2 minutes
When you are FINISHED with them, THEN order your entrees
We ordered everything at once and our entrees arrived well before we were finished with our apps, and they certainly didn't care
Pace yourself here, or they'll rush you out in 20 minutes flat
The food quality has seriously gone downhill
As a neighbor to the restaurant, I frequented sea often
The food is sometimes not fresh, the curry flavor is hit or miss, and the portion size has sunk to below half of what it used to be
I could mention the service, but this has been at the same low it has always been
It seems like sea cares more about the profit, than the quality of its food
Absolutely the WORSE service! Williamsburg is filled with restaurants offering the best types of cuisines and friendly service
Sea is NOT one of them
We had a party of 13 where we made reservations over a week in advance and confimed the day of
We were not seated promptly or properly
They sat us on 2 oval tables that normally seat 4 people comfortably on each
When asking if we can move to a larger table, the waitress argued that the two tables clearly sits 16 all while half the party had their legs sticking out of the table
Her solution was seperating the group into a seperate booth table! When we called upon the manager he seemed very disinterested in our problem and was also rude as if listening to a customer was a hassle
NONE of us will ever return
Proof is in all the reviews on citysearch
great vibe, food, music, people
not what you would expect from williamsburg
This place has great food, not spectacular, but you definitely get MORE than your dollar's worth
Make reservations, because even on a Wednesday night, you WILL wait at the least half an hour for a table
The drinks here are delicious, try many
The decor is great, but if you are keen on greating good service, then don't come here, because I have never been served well here
The pre-made food was tasteless and served without regard to the pace of a meal
We placed our full order
The wine and appetizer came immediately
The chewy, tasteless dumplings were clearly reheated
Not halfway through the appetizer, our entree arrived reheated
I had the red snapper, which was dry and full of bones (very charming on a date)
When I gave up on my fish, I turned to the pile of greens on my plate only to get a mouth full of grit
Still hungry, we decided to share a dessert
However, once our plates were cleared the service staff disappeared as well
It took longer to order dessert and get our check than the whole rest of the meal put together
The place does look cool, but go for a drink and the bathroom, then go eat at any one of the many GREAT restaurants in the area
This place really does the trick
I've been going there since it opened and am a native to Williamsburg
The space is huge, the menu is vast and caters to all, the drinks are delicious
Try the Mali which is a lycheee martini
They even add rose petals to it
Cocktails are a nice price for a place such as this
It has a very trendy atmosphere
The staff is great and very friendly
In comparison to the turn out they receive they have the patience of saints
They have a great bar area where you can relax with a cocktail
The bathrooms are very impressive
Overall, I've celebrated many occassions at Sea for various events and will be a loyal customer for a long time
I live on N
6th so as soon as this place opened I became a regular
I even planned to hold my wedding reception here
No more! The last time I went was w/a bunch of friends, a birthday celebration so we had high expectations
The food was AWFUL!! Every dish was prepared sometime earlier in the day with a smattering of pre-steamed vegetables and sauce thrown on top as it was brought to the table
One friend asked to change her fish she ordered to duck, the fish was dry and hard
Even on the second go-round, she could only eat the room-temperature vegetables because the meat was like rubber
Truly inedible! It's a shame, Sea was so ON! Those days are over
We will never go back to this restaurant
Place is gorgeous, food is awesome, the damn waiters are rude as hell
straight up rude
Not about a long wait like others have said
they will just let you sit there until youre blue in the face before they take your order
Now that i think about it, im sorry that our waiter received a tip as he was non existent! good price, good food, great decor
but they need a new team for service
HORRIBLE!
We went on a Tuesday night at 7pm and we didn't have to wait at all
but we sat in the back next to the kitchen where the light was terrible and I could hardly read my tiny menu
Our appetizers were very yummy but my sweet sour chicken was kind of bland
My boyfriend had the Pad Thai with the rice instead of noodles
forget the name
He enjoyed it thoroughly
The house white wine was terrible
tasted like water with a kick
The crispy banana desser was delicious
definitely try it! The bathrooms are very cool and worth going to wash your hands if you don't have to use the facilities
Our service was not terrible
just average
In fact, our food came out very quickly
RUDE AND AWFUL HOSTESS: We made a reservation for 8 people, happened to be 7 people
When we wanted to put our name down on the list to get a table, she told us that they were busy enough and that they did not need our business
It was almost like an episod of Seinfeld - the Pad Thai Nazis
I've been to Sea many times and I have never been disappointed
The food is always great and I love the atmosphere, with the exception of the wait
but then you get to enjoy the bar for a little while
The meals are inexpensive and well worth it
I live a few blocks from SEA and I eat there at least once a month sometimes more
Invariably I get the same dish - pineapple fried rice with cashews and veggies
If you don't eat meat it's the dish for you

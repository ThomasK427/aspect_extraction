They also have a great selection of starters
One of my favorite starters are the crab cakes they are fantastic
They have a nice bar set-up for drinks before an event and one of the best signatue drinks i've tasted in many places
They also have an entrance to the garden when you finish your meal
The service is unbelievable and although the uniforms are not very appealing to their atmosphere hopefully this review will open some eyes in thier ownership
I LOVE NICK AND STEFS
YOU GUYS ROCK
Nick and Stef's was a great time
The staff was very proffesional and kind
The food was outstanding
I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a great meal in New York City
The wait staff knows the menu like the back of thier hand and is very helpful
I went a couple of times and fully intend on going back whenever I am around MSG
Tell a friend
Nick and Stef's is the place to be
From the street you could miss it walking by the front door
I've gone to there a few times, the staff is great, not your typical stuffy steakhouse crew-very friendly and professional
By the second visit I was hooked, they remembered us and went all out to make the night a great experience
One time I went on a game night-tons of people! But, since they know me, when I'm going to MSG I've got the hookup, they have a private entrance-no lines! The other times I've gone it's romantic date heaven, you can walk in get a booth by the windows, be treated like a VIP in a not-crowded place, with great food and service
Nick Stef's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area, so if you happen to be by Madison Square Garden or Herald's Square check it out!
that a restaurant in this neighborhood could deliver such a great experience! The steaks are delicious and so are the sides
We shared a crabcake appetizer which was amazing (all crab!) Other things people ordered were great too-- shrimp scampi, a venison special and the desserts
The service is professional but not stuffy like other steakhouses
Same goes for the atmosphere, really refreshing
But isn't it all about food really? The food here is excellent, so I'm definitely going back for more!
being a carnivore restaurant fan, and having lived in NY all my life, I have tried EVERY steakhouse
This is, by far, the worst steakhouse and I use the term loosely(Idon't know what they eat in LA, but if it's this, I will never go!)
Supermarket meat, frozen hash brown brick, no taste spinich, watery bernaise, deserts to die FROM, slow clueless serviceand everything cold and way overpriced! THINK Lugars, Ruth's, Mortons, (you can even do better at Outback)
Because the service is ABOMINABLE and you'll need to have someone you can talk to to kill the time between the waiter making appearances
Fortunately, my colleague and I were able to do so and therefore were able to enjoy our meal
The food is a good average - nothing particularly out of the ordinary for what I'd expect for a steakhouse of this type in the city
The wine list is decent, but grossly overpriced
Thank goodness for the $50 birthday certificate! I'd recommend it and go back, but ONLY with the $50 coupon and on an expense account, like I did this time
After visiting most of the top steakhouses in NYC, this was by far the worst dining experience
We waited 15 minutes for a waiter to come to our table and introduce themselves
The filet mignon was overcooked and the waiter argued that it was fine
My wife's seafood combo was so salty that she couldn't eat it
I sent an e-mail to the manager over 2 weeks ago and no one has contacted me to try to fix it
If you are in the neighborhood and need a good steakhouse
try Keens!!!
I went to Nick Stefs this past Saturday night with my girlfriend, we got the filet mignon, lobster, and creamed spinach
The food was excellent and cooked perfectly, the service was great as well as having a top notch waiter who was knowledgeable and friendly as well!  I would definitely return to Nick Stefs, especially since it is in a neighborhood so void of good restaurants! this one is a keeper!
I usually don't write my opinions on websites, but some of these comments are way off base
The food in this restaurant is average at best
It is way overpriced and the portions are small
It seems that the only people who loved their meals were the ones who got $50 or $100 off their check
It is convenient to MSG and that was the only plus
None of the eight people that dined there were impressed
In fact it was a very forgetful meal on a great night
If you're in the area, try Keen's - which is a significantly better place
I am not a steak connoisseur, but I know what I like, and my experience at Nick and Stef's left me satisfied
My friend and I both had the filet mignon, which was simply outstanding
What's more, the mixed greens that came with the steak were remarkable and very unique
The wine was ridiculously expensive (The house cabernet was $12 per glass)
The service seemed a touch off, but very courteous
The decor is very pleasant and there is a lot of elbow room, even though it didn't seem that way in the picture
The price tag was high even with the dine out certificate, but I expected nothing less from a good steakhouse
We probably would have never gone to Nick and Stefs had we not had the $30 off coupon
It was a decent steak, and definitely worth it with the coupon
Other than that though, it was scorching hot inside the restaurant, and when we asked them to turn down the heat, they said that the Garden controls their temp, so they couldn't
Instead, they opened a door - in the middle of January!! I know it wasn't their fault, but it still didn't make for the most pleasurable dining experience
Overall, it was good, but I probably wouldn't go back
For the good-restaurant-starved area around Penn Station, Nick and Stef's is a welcome treat
I went on a Saturday night, pre-theater (and used the famous $50 gift certificate, which you can't beat!) and we had a fabulous meal
The salmon was delicious and mashed potatoes are some of the best I've ever had
My boyfriend, a huge steak fan, loved his meal too
The service was wonderful and even at such an early hour there was enough of a crowd that we didn't feel like we were at the early bird special and it added to the warm atmosphere
The decor is very classy and cozy
The only complaint I have is that the tables for 2 along the booth are very close together so it wasn't as romantic a dinner as we wanted but all in all, we were in our own world, more like in heaven
:)
This place surprised me
For somewhere connected to Penn Station and MSG it wasn't too crowded and even if it was filled with people (which it wasn't) there was plenty of room to be seated comfortably
The wine list was ridiculously long and just as ridiculously priced
However the food was great, love that steak!
this place is worth a visit- particularly if you are catching a show at MSG
WITH it- it is unbeatable- the food is delicious and the service is perfection
The ribeye was cooked perfectly and the cheese mashed potatoes are fabulous
They let us use two $50 dine outs and were super accomodating the whole time- I will be going back as long as the dine outs last
The only downer is the decor makes you remember you are attached to Penn Station- feels like a seedy hotel restaurant
I am a huge fan of steak so after reading some of the reviews here i decided to check this place out (the location was what kept me from going there in the first place)
first, i was never served any of the corn bread everyone speaks so highly of and it wasnt on the menu - so that was odd
our waitress was phenominal and the food was pretty good - i actually like angelo and maxies steaks and creamed spinach better - but it was fun to share the porterhouse for 2
our meal was enjoyable none the less and we still rolled ourselves home
by the way desert is to die for - avoid the creme brulee sampler because its shockingly small
I love a steakhouse like everyone else, yet this place has the best cornbread OF MY LIFE, and of my friend's lives
We fight over it
It doesn't even need butter
And the steaks, the sides, all those potatoes, it's all a foodie's heaven
Can't wait to go back
Thanks!
This is the best steakhouse in NYC and I have tried virtually all of them (Luger's, Smith Wollensky's, etc
)
The steaks are out of this world
I prefer their filet or ribeye and not the strip which they say is the house specialty
You have to try the creamed spinach as it is probably the best side dish in all of New York
I have been here at least a half dozen times and will be back even more than that inthe future
I have not eaten there when an event was going on at Madison Square Garden
I imagine that it would be more hectic and rushed than normally
Try it when there is not an event there and you will like it for sure
Went there bc of the $50 dine out ny coupon - the porterhouse is very yummy, the ny stripe is decent

It was not even close
It was supposed to be all tuna, salmon yellowtail
Instead I got egg, mackeral and some other nasty fish AND only like 5 pieces for a ridiculous amount of money
The waitstaff barely spoke English so you couldn't complain to them because they didn't understand you
I think they thought we were tourists who never had sushi before so they gave us all the cheapest fish they had
Someone had the shrimp dumplings
they were good
Don't waste your money
There are tons of better sushi places in NYC
I've been a client of Karl since the days of Eisay
He was one of the best bartenders I've ever had serve me
But now he is a restaurant owner and he brings his special touch to very interesting restaurant
He adds several personal dishes to the typical Japanese menu with some tasty Sake Martinis
The atmosphere is cozy with nice subdued lighting and friendly service
There is an interesting selection of hot and cold Sake in addition to a wine list with wines that are priced from moderate to expensive
I've had most of the wines and they are excellent as they are suggested by a wine specialist
Got take out for lunch one day
It was a great meal, with tempura, miso soup, dumplings, and sushi! I was really happy with it and the service was really great
The ambiance is pretty and a bit romantic
But the whole thing was a bit pricey for a lunch special
Very high quality sushi, wonderfully prepared, in a comfortable space
If you like sushi, this is a must try
I always thought sushi was pretty standard but now I know that I was completely wrong
I had the yellowtail jalepeno and later wasabi ice cream and I was hooked
The place is owned by former Mita bartender Carl Sunagawa and he's brought that charm with him
There's no more than 12 tables and a sushi bar which makes the place pretty comfortable unlike other chain fusion japanese restaurants and I was surrounded by Japanese customers which, to me, is a good indication of the quality
Everything is so good! Especially Sushi! Ask Chef's Special
You will abusolutly enjoy best sushi in town!!!
I loved the bar with a big TV and romantic panels which change colors
Good looking sushi chefs makes sushi taste even better
So my wife and I were on our way to Crif Dogs for some July 4th merriment
It wasn't open yet so we started walking around the neighborhood
My love! she said dramatically
What is that? She was pointing towards Ruben's Empanadas
It appears to be some sort of empanada-selling emporium, my darling dear, I replied
So we went in and had some empanadas
They were real good
They're almost as good as the ones this Puerto Rican abuelita makes me in Bushwick
But, hey, what can equal that?
Something has gone terribly wrong with The Queen's Hideaway
We went there a few times last summer and fall and the food was great
We ate there recently and our table was covered with dog hair! The staff all but ignored us and spent most of their time smoking and drinking in the garden
The food was mediocre and the portions much smaller than last year and the prices have increased from $11 an entree last year to $17 or $18 on average
All you get for this huge price hike is attitude, smaller portions, a smoky garden and having to pull dog hair out of your mouth
What a shame because the chefs are talented
SAVE YOURSELVES
RUN AWAY! Our dining expereince was SO BAD that it inspired me to write my first ever review
Let me preface by saying that I dont mind slow, casual restaurants (in fact I love them), generally Im pretty patient with disdainful hipster service, and I am used to small plate dining (if the food is excellent I will always forgive small portions)
With all that in mind, I have to say that even for me, THIS was the WORST dining experience of my life
1
SLOW SLOW- 20 minutes before our server even came over
2 HOURS before we saw any food
My boyfriend and I finished a whole bottle of wine before we saw anything to eat
THEN, even after that it still took the waitress 25 minutes to bring our check after we'd eaten
No apologies, no comps, no explanation
2
SMALL PORTIONS
So after waiting two hours for our food, it arrives and though tasty (nothing amazing, but good) it was the most insulting amount of food ever
My salad consisted of 4 leaves of greens
I am not kidding
4
Now, I love small plate dining, but this was ridiculous
They brought the soup in a small tumbler glass, and it was like 1/4 full, but you can get they still charged 6 dollars, for 5 spoonfuls (maybe) of soup
Come on
I have never felt so ripped off
3
HUGE ATTITUDE
and as if that isn't all enough -- the place had a weird very negative vibe
Im a server at a place in soho, and I sympathize with servers always, but this was unforgivable
Chefs were cursing about the customers, employees were smoking after telling people they'd smoke outside
Even the cutest place is awful when filled with a bunch of jerks
Only Positive: Great music, but I can listen to my records at home, without spending $80 on the worst dining expereince ever
Close this place down, please
Chef Liza is a sweetheart, and so are her helpers
We wandered in around 8 and luckily were seated right away
Those who came later were told it was a long wait and sent to nearby bars to hang out until their tables were ready
The food is unusual, rich, fresh, and tasty
Try everything
And there IS a liquor license now
It's still pretty new and there's not a lot of room inside, but we were able to squeeze in without reservations on a Saturday night luckily (though that doesn't appear to be the norm)
The handwritten menu makes me think the choices change frequently -- we started with pumpkin fritters and then had bunny rabbit and sea bass cakes
The space was small enough to allow the service to not suffer too badly, even with every table full
Just remember it's BYOB until the liquor license arrives
Poona is truly a pleasant experience from start to finish
I have eaten here twice, and was impressed both times by the welcoming, courteous service and great value
In fact, althought the food is good, it was more the friendly atmosphere that brought me back the second time
This is not the best Indian food in NY, and the dining room is kind of small and non-descript, which is why I recommend it more for locals looking to have a comfortable meal, and do not necessarily suggest that people travel here
While everything I have eaten here was good, items such as chicken tikka makhni and shrimp vindaloo stand out
Fried foods, such as samosas and poori bread were less impressive
If you live on the upper west side, or find yourself around Amsterdam ave
and craving Indian food, definitely try it
I love indian food, the sight, smell and taste
For years my favorite restaurant was Gate of India in my hometown, L
A
Having moved to NYC about 6 years ago, I hadn't found an Indian restaurant that had the same
well authentic flare
in cooking
I found Grand Poona when they were located on 72nd st about 3 years ago, and have stayed loyal sense
What keeps me there is a combination of prices, food and extremely pleasant service
When you go, try the Tandoori Chicken

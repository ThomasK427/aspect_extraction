I want a party there every year
The food was exquisite and the service was impeccable
The prices were fair for all of the food that we had
The Cub Room is the best Restaurant in town, and I eat out every night so that is saying a lot
The restaurant is divided into the fine-dining (ie
extremely expensive) area and the cafe
The cafe menu and dinner menu are different also
The cafe service was very lackluster and the waitresses were too busy chatting in the back to attend to us, while the regular restaurant service was helpful and friendly
The decor is not bad, its a well-kept, clean restaurant with a homely feel
Finally, the food is great in both presentation and taste
The variety is great, but not justified with the prices
My fiance's mom was visiting from out of town and for her birthday dinner I was recommended the Cub Room for a trendy SoHo great kitchen
On a Thursday night of the July 4th week, we were all alone in the dining room (even after spending an hour at the bar), and the food was uneven
No specials and no crab limited the menu choices, and the toast for my (very average) foie gras arrived 5 minutes after the rest of the food, and was cold and burnt
I've only eaten in the bar area, but I love it every time! The service is fantastic, at least out there
The waitresses are so patient, helpful and nice
The grilled chicken sandwich is really good and only $12
And the hummus is good, and large
Agree that the prices on the dinner entrees are a bit steep for what it is, but overall, the ambience is nice, unpretentious and cozy
The Cub Room is unlike ANYTHING I've ever seen
My friends and I started out having drinks in the cafe, and we didn't even realize that the Cafe was only a third of the place
The entire place is HUGE!!! And each room is so different from the next
We ended up having appetizers in the lounge, while listening to a really great DJ
The food was amazing, and the atmosphere was incredible
I hear that they also have one of the most reputable fine dining rooms in NYC
We didn't get to check that out because we didn't have a reservation
But we had an amazing time in the cafe lounge!!!!!!!!!!!!
The first time I went to the Cub Room I enjoyed it
but then again, I was the guest of a birthday party and the birthday girl's husband picked up the bill
The 2nd (and definitely last) time I went, I discovered the surprisinigly pricey drink menu
sorry, hipsters, but an $8 beer? Didn't think that existed yet, but apparently it does
And, even though the place was far from full that evening, the service was incredibly slow -- I dare say attitudinal
When we asked any way we can get some pretzels or something (at the bar) the bartender replied yes, sure then went back to chatting with his co-worker
I will say the appetizers are quite tasty and come at a palatable price
But there are plenty of places with tasty appetizers in new york city and I shan't be back
Wow - I read some of the reviews and I have to say that I had a great time there last weekend
I went there with 2 friends on Sunday and we sat in the lounge
The bar also looks cool, and the wait staff was professional and friendly
Will definitely visit again!
We were celebrating our wedding anniversary with a group of close friends
My wife couldnt pick a better place The service was first class, and the food was to die for!! I loved the ambiance and the design of the restaurant
Ill strongly recommend the place to anyone who wants to enjoy the best New York has to offer
Absolutely my favorite place in town

I had dinner for four this past Saturday night, and it was one of the best meals I've had in years
The filet absolutely melts in your mouth, and the sommelier paired a bottle of cabernet to match that was outstanding
The server was patient and attentive (we had never been there before), despite how busy the dining room was, and the souffle for dessert (order early) is worth travelling for
Overall, I thought the experience was lovely-and fun- and I'm not the only one, the place was packed!
I'm slightly confounded as to how this place gets such glowing reviews
Granted, I have only one experience to go on, but it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in NYC, so that must count for something
To keep it brief, here are the facts: We had a group of 10
They made us squeeze into a too-small table rather than find another solution
The background music was terrible -- 80s and 90s cheese
The service was slow, indifferent, and everyone's food came out at different times
My frittata arrived at room temperature
For $11 or so it was one of the blandest, most boring fritattas/omelettes I've ever had
My neighborhood diners do better
In sum, everything was freakishly overpriced, and I can't think of one good thing to say about the Cub Room - at least based on this one experience
Is it all hype?
I selected this venue for a work dinner and I can honestly say it was an incredible let down
My steak looked worse than the grizzle and fat John Candy had to finish in the Great Outdoors and the service, while friendly, was incredibly slow even though we were one of only 4 other tables
We waited for over 30 minutes for our coffee and dessert, which only came after I told them to cancel the order so we could leave
I agree with a previous user
The food was great but service was TERRIBLE
The problems, have to keep it short (word limit) 1
Menus were missing entire dinner page
2
Our wine was not served properly
no I'm no wine aficionado, but I know some basics
Waitress didn't even bother filling empty glasses when she dropped by the table?!?! 3
When they brought out the food the waiter dropped one of the plates right in front of us and didn't appologize or bring us out a complimentry plate
We had to call over the waitress and tell her this! 4
When the waitress asked how the everything was I went off on her told her the service was terrible, she said the manager would come over
he never came
we just watned to leave at that point!  In conclusion, there are better places to spend your money
skip this joint!
About 10 years ago, this place was one of our favorite spots to dine in Soho
The food is still very yummy, but the service was so poor on a Saturday night
Unattentive
Ran out of Pineapple Upside Down cake and forgot to tell us, so we sat there for half hour waiting for dessert with nothing and no one to offer us another choice
Huh? No apologies
Young amateur waiters just looking around the room
Too bad, because the entrees and appetizers were delicious, but I would never go back because of the poor service
Too many other great places to eat in the city in the $32
entree price range!
I had a marvelous time
Took a date there and despite the $210 tab for 2 drinks, dinner, tip, two bottles of wine, and evian, I thought it was a great value
Best service I've ever experienced in a restaurant
Great somalier
Great waiter who brought out a special birthday desert for my date after asking if it was a special occasion
The food was the best part
Do yourself and your wallet a favor, and stay away from the new Cub Room
New owners have taken the old neighborhood standard, and they lowered the quality of the food and service, and then raised the prices to outrageous levels
The $12 calamari was mostly guacamole
$28 for the sea scallop entree, that consisted only of 4 normal scallops, was smaller than an appetizer
The food tasted ok but it was cold
The waiter was never around
At the end of our meal for two, which included one Ketel Tonic and one ginger ale, a check for $100 was presented
That's is how to waste money in this city
The food was excellent, if pricey, and the service extremely accommodating

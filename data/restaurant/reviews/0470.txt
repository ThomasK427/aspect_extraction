Gives us the worst seat in the house
Thereafter the night was good
Our server was helpful and attentive
The food was terrific
Overall the experience was a good one
However I would be a little more demanding of the staff and Maitre'D if I was to return to celabrate an occasion
I had heard soooooo much about this place so we decided to go for dinner last friday
As we were running late (stuck in traffic) called the resturant to inform them and they made us wait for an hour! 1 hour for being 10 minutes late!! When we finally got the food, it was bad
There was sand in the clam chowder, had to return it
The spinach was soooooo salty, had to return that too
Overall a bad expereince, not going back for sure
There are plenty of great places to go to in this city
We heard many great things about this place and decided to give it a try
We had reservations and got seated right away in the down stairs room
The room is nicely decorated however, it is simply just too dark in there for dinner
Our waiter was extremely rude, and not attentive at all
The food was aweful, I ordered duck and because it was so dark in there, I put a piece of fat in my mouth
Not sure why there is a big chunk of fat in there in the first place
The waiter rushed us through the last half of our dinner because they were turning the room into a dance floor
I would never go back to Butter again
Way over-rated
My experience dining at Butter was a very pleasant one
My husband I were wise enough to call and make a reservation beforehand
Anyone who lives in this city should know this
The service was beyond excellent, and the food was amazing
The lower level was a little tight for me
but that's not my scene anyways
Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Butter
One thing I have learned from my dining experiences
if you want great service, try smiling to you're waitor
You're guaranteed a fine, dining experience
I just read the previous review and completely disagree
The downstairs is unlike anything else I have experienced in this city
It does feel like a lounge, but that's what I want on a Friday or Saturday night with my friends
I have dined at butter since it opened in 2001 and the food, ambience, and service have been nothing but stellar
Good times at Butter!
I think my expectations were a little too high when I walked into Butter
We had a fairly large party and I felt as if we were being rushed by our waiter
We also had reservations, but had to wait around at the bar for about 15 minutes before being seated
The food was pretty good, but I would have preferred to sit upstairs
I think the downstairs area is better if you're just going for drinks
I felt like I was in a dungeon
There were 10 of us last Saturday for my bachlorette party and the Butter Staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a great evening
Service was excellent, the halibut was to die for, and the DJ downstairs had a great vibe
At the end of the night we had drinks in the lounge and the maitre'd called us in to another club (Hiro)
Had a blast at Hiro and no wait! The line was all the way down the street
No restaurant compares to Butter, they have connections and really made our night!
We waited over 45 minutes for two people during an off time -- when we were seated we saw tons of open tables and they still made us wait! The food, which took forever!! was nothing to brag about
The waiters were clueless and SLOW!!!! We should have walked out, but we were hungry
Would not recommend and would NEVER go back
I took my family to Butter early on a Monday night and the hostess sat us in nice booth in the upstairs great room
They were suprisingly very accomodating with my two girls under the age of 8
The server was very attentive and the halibut was cooked more than I wanted so they brought out a new one and took it off the bill completely
Great place, I will be back
I will admit I had my doubts after reading mixed reviews, and after were an hour late for my husband's birthday dinner Butter was more than accomodating
We were stuck in traffic and when I called the reservationist she said it would be no problem, and sure enough we were sat right away
I was taken back buy the space, our server courtney was so accomodating, and the food was wonderful
I mentioned it was my husband's birthday, and we were sent a complimentary dessert with candles and the whole 9 yards
Great Place, and next time I will be on time, I promise!!
Overall, my impression of Butter was that the best part of the meal was actually the bread and butter
So the name gets and an A+
However, the overall food, dcor and experience is just average
A local bar serves better drinks and the service is much friendlier! Not to mention they dont require a 20% tip! The apps and entrees were nothing spectacular and the dessert could have been delivered from Dunkin Donuts
Hopefully Butter does a better job impressing other patrons, cause Ill surely NEVER return! In my opinion, this once critically acclaimed restaurant is turning to margarine
I really wanted this place to be good
Alas, it was not
I went with 3 other people and tried everyone's food so I got a sense of what it was all about
Everything tasted like I had burnt my tongue and couldn't taste anything
Fish was overcooked
Meat was blah
Water was delicious but scarce
What's going on? Why was the restaurant full? I think the crowd wanted to be there because they heard the Olsen Twins ate there once
The waiter was friendly but an idiot
This was like being in some terrible movie about snotty people with no taste
This was the restaurant equivilant of Cats
If you want to impress someone from out of town with a trendy restaurant than this is the place - but only by appearances and not by food quality or service
High marks for atmosphere but a ZERO for service
I went for restaurant week June 2005
We were promptly seated but waited 25 minutes to get the waiter to come back around and take our order
Drinks were ordered and those came 20 minutes later
Food was salty and mediocre
I waited 15 minutes for the waiter to take the bill from me and finally I got fed up with him walking past our table I had to start waving the bill in the air and finally some other waitress took our bill
I guess the automatic 20% added service for every party size is a license for waiters to let patrons wait when it's convenient for the waiters!
I am not one to complain, but I was so frustrated by my experience here that I thought I had to warn others
The dining room was beautiful but that was about the only good thing
The worst part was the horrible service and snobby attitudes
I went here for a business lunch
Our waiter was not attentive, we waited about 20 mins just to order drinks
We decided to do a 3 course meal
The first course was fine, second course was cold and we waited over 30 mins for desserts that never came
I tried to voice my frustration with the wait staff, but they seemed to care less about what had happened
No one appologized and I was completly embarassed by the service since I had taken a business client with me
I will never, ever return to this place again and I wouldn't reccomend it
I wish I had listened to the reviewers, they were right
Butter has a nice scene, but in my eyes, food and service should always trump scene
We went during June 05 Restaurant Week
Waiter couldn't have cared less what we ordered
Entrees - Mahi-Mahi was flavorless
Short ribs had a crock-pot like quality
Appetizers - mushroom soup was good but all cream, if you like that sort of thing

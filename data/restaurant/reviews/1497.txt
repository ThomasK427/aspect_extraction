I need to go back and try more on the menu
I highly reccomend this place!!!!!!!!
Ambiance, service, presentation
all very nice
We had the ceviche for an appetizer and three rolls for dinner
Everything tasted fine, but nothing exceptional to entice us to return instead of trying something else that's new
smack in the theater district on a side street
Cool decor , good rolls and cocktailmenu
The bartender took time with us and made some great recomendations on sake cocktails, saketinis
Also dropped in after work and they had happy hour drink specials
It's May 13th, and this place has been open for 1 month
As my girlfriend and I walked by we noticed ZERO people eating there
Skeptical of the quality of the food, we went in
Surprisingly, however, the food was excellent, rivaling places such as Sushi Samba, Aki, and Ocean Grill in freshness of the food and quality of presentation
I would highly recommend
There was plenty of space, with large tables (granted we were the only ones in there)
The two cons were the lack of information on the menus (they had just sushi roll names, with no description of their contents, printed in a bland format), and music selection, which didn't fit the ambiance
Two things that, hopefully, can be easily fixed
Went to dinner at Aoki last night and it was outstanding! This place has fresh sushi and unique rolls
The white tuna was especially yummy! The atmosphere was hip (but not too hip) and is an oasis in the bustle of surrounding Times Square
Prices were certainly reasonable for the quality
The service was great as well! Well definitely be back!
I had lunch here last week and couldn't believe how good it was
I got a lunch box specials and the quality of food and size was great
I would def
go back and have lunch or try dinner here
Oh, my
Ever since my hubby and I found this authentic Sushi place, we never have a secound thought
As a Japanese couple living in this neighborhood for years, it is really a matter of survival whether we could find a truly great Japanese place nearby
Of course, UES provides a couple of other great Japanese restaurants that appeal to many Japanese, BUT what's so great about Inase is its quality
Sushi is just amazing
I love its presentation, quality fish, sushi rice
I am also amazed by the work of kitchen chef!! Don't miss 'dessert'!! You will know what I am talking about
Enjoy!!
Food is excellent, and after a few trip to Inase, I also got to know the chefs
These quiet professionals working behind the sushi counter and in the kitchen, they all come from Japan, polished their skill from their masters like true Samurai
Mr
Wami, the head sushi chef, was the chef at the Maeda on 41st until they closed the business for good
NY Yankees #55 Matsui was one of his major clients
Mr
Tony mainly works in the kitchen his creation of the starter and desert is always refreshing
I highly recommend Chirashi sushi, deep fried fluke, and Ebi Shinjo
They also have specials
They have a backroom for a group, and some interesting art from Japan
Very friendly group of waitress excellent service
My friends and I had a wonderful meal there
The sushi was very fresh, and they also had a lot of seasonal cooked items
They have a good variety of fish, and they also have some unique rolls you  can find in japan but not so much here
The wait staff was very friendly, and that made our food experience even better
Highly recommmended
I've been to Inase now twice and I love it! The sushi is so good and that's what keeps me going back
I love the salmon, tuna, shrimp tempura rolls and the fluke
Last time I was there the chef made me a special dessert called yokan (red bean cake with strawberry sauce on top) and it was delicious
The wait staff is very friendly and helpful
I highly recommend Inase to you if you love Japanese food
Enjoy!
My friends and I were walking in the LES having no plans on what to do
We came across Rewind, not knowing what is just checking out the place
We looked at the menu, ordered some apps and loved the Shrimp Cakes! We sat at the bar, finished our food and had some drinks
As we were about to leave, we just noticed that there was a live dj there and a lounge at the back
To cut things short, we ended up staying the rest of the night
Had a really good time
Awesome DJ, awesome bartenders
'nuff said
They clearly write their own citysearch reviews! The only good thing about this place is the mango mojitos
The food is terrible and the lava cake is the worst I have ever had
Overall bad experience- don't go!
finally a gem in the L
E
S
the music, the vibe, the service and the food
a must try and see for yourself
the lava cake is also the best dessert ive ever had
it melts in your mouth
the service is also great
after dinner they make it into a nice lounge with great music
Rewind is a nice cozy place in the LSE
The ambience is impressive and the staff and owners' attention to detail/customer service is unmatched
A group of us celebrated my wife's 30th on a Saturday and we had the best time
Dinner (try the beef tenderloin and molten lava cake!) was followed by drinking and dancing (great selection of music)
Would definitely go back
I was tremendously surprised when I went to REWIND, the staff was great the drinks were amazing and the food was top notch
I have not had fresher pasta in my life! This place definitely needs more recognition for its chef and ambience
We had the chicken pot stickers and they were served on sugar canes which really added that touch
The lava cake does take time to make but it was well worth it
DEFINITELY GO!! The food and music will not disappoint!
By far one of the best meals I have had recently
This is a great new find
The wait staff was really friendly and the vibe in the place was really cool
They bring to the table the most amazing tasting hummus
so good
I ordered the cuttlefish fettuccini which was tasty
And for desert the Lava Cake
this is a MUST when you go
Why is this only listed as a bar?!?!? This was quite a nice find for Dinner last week
The restanrant, food and staff were just plain fantastic
I had the gnocchi and shrimp and it was so tasty! The gnocchi was perfectly cooked
Andre, the chef, also made a great recommendation on the wine
oops forget the name! Desert was also fantastic
The exploding cake was one of the best desert experiences I have had in years

its always a good time
good prices and great BBQ
gotta love the dirty south
go terps!!
So I go into the bar, and I ask the (extremely hot) waitress, what's the soup of the day? She responds, Soup Du Jour
And I was like
MMMMM
That sounds good I'll take that
The food here is very inconsistent and has become worse over time, which is too bad for anyone that likes Southern cuisine
My boyfriend and I felt ill all night so beware
The atmosphere is a cross between Hooters and a frat party
The place is too loud and the tv volume slowy creeps up and up all night
If you're 21 and don't know what good food is come here
If you like really drunk people almost falling on you when you eat come here
This is like a Hooters with BBQ
The food isn't too bad but the price really creeps up on you
Pretty busy but the staff did a good job getting you your drinks on time
A little too young (unless you're about 21)
thank goodness i can go to brother jimmy's, play golden tee, and watch any ACC game i want
thank you
definitely fills the gap left from college
Go Hoos!!
This place is the ideal setting for heavy beer drinking, barbecue feasting, and more heavy beer drinking
The barbecue falls off the bone and melts in your mouth
The service needs a little work, but overall it's worth a look
Brother Jimmy's is the best bar in NYC
I have never had a bad time here, never NOT had a conversation with a total stranger, never NOT met someone new
If you're going for the food, TRY THE MAC AND CHEESE! I can't stress that enough
Good food and great waitstaff
They're a great bunch of girls (and darn cute too!)
The bartenders are always on the ball and seem to be having fun while making sure everyone gets a drink
Great music too
Fun mix of eras and songs! I can't say enough about Brother Jimmy's
I don't care for the other two locations very much, but this one is great
Get a fishbowl
You'll meet more people than you want to!
A good place to go for a casual atmosphere
Get the fishbowl drink if you're with a big group
Also a great place to eat during the week
good place to hang out with buddies over beer and a football game, enjoy their souvenier cocktail drinks in volcano jugs, they can really hit you! potatoes, ribs, wings, caesar salad, all good for the bar food category, nice bartenders too for the boys viewing pleasures! reasonable
Always crowded, every day of the week!
OK, so everything is fried, covered in cheese, stewed with bacon fat, or some version of pork
So what? Once in a while you need to let loose and eat some down-home barbecue
Hey, at least the barbecue sauce isn't too fattening
With a group of rowdy Brits and Texans, we were made to feel right at home in Brother Jimmy's recently, even when we opted for a giant demon punch with 12 straws
Shirts were unbuttoned, dancing (perfect music, guys!) began and all the while the staff (yummy) remained accomodating and even contributed to a great Saturday night out
Brother Jimmy's is one of the Best Bar-B-Que places to go in the city, the atmosphere is a little trashy so if you are looking to impress a date this is NOT the place to go! The bar is a lot of fun on it's own, you never know what celebrity couple will show up or who you will run into
Overall the food is CHEAP GOOD
As soon as i walked in i felt at home
food is like moms, atmosphere like college not to mentioned great staff and music
this winner should be franchised, I want my Brother Jimmys everwhere!!!!!!! keep up the great work!!!!!
Jimmy's has excellent ribs and fixins and is great place to drink and meet people
But besides the fact it does have TVs tuned to sports, calling it a sports bar- I don't see it
But the BBQ is well worth it and the hook-up quotatient is high
Quite simply, the barbecue (and sauce) is great
Coming from someone who has been eating barbecue in the south for years, I'm never disappointed in the food
It's always tasty, well prepared, and affordably priced
They are very accommodating for large groups, and the Swamp Water especially adds to the fun experience
With good frineds, good food and a great staff, you are bound to enjoy yourself
With the flashing sign imploring you to EAT MEAT, surrounded by pictures of smiling and dancing pigs everywhere, it might give you pause
Follow your nose instead to go and sink your teeth into tender, juicy ribs with meat that falls off the bone, or wings that can sear the taste buds off your tongue
Cap that with a cold pitcher of beer on a summer afternoon, and you've got a little slice of Southern heaven in NYC
Snaps to Brother Jimmy's for serving Missippi Mud, evoking JazzFest and gumbo memories for this reviewer
The food is great, the portions are large, the waitstaff is friendly, the decor is
trailer park, but damn it is good food
Wouldn't take a date there, but for bbq and brews, there is no better place to go out with the buds
I'm a student at the University of North Carolina, and I'm interning here for the summer
Whenever I need a taste of Southern Hospitality, great food and drinks, I go to Brother Jimmy's
All of the NC stuff and memorabilia from the South make me feel right at home
On about 5 nights out of the week they have some sort of all-you-can-eat/drink combo that is well worth the money
It gets no better than White Trash Wednesdays! $1 margaritas for the ladies and 25% off all food if you have a Southern ID
The waitresses are usually incredibly attractive
That's quite a plus
If you have a big group, the Trash Can punch is a must
Brother Jimmys is a taste of the south right in NYC
go here to watch ACC college hoops or March Madness
guaranteed to meet other die-hard hoops fans
also they have great southern BBQ and great drinks such as Trash Can Punch!!!
Pricey, but tastey
Their wraps, pizzas, and pastries are all fantastic
Aside from the scrumtuous looking baked goods, this is some of the better pizza I've had in awhile
They also have some good looking sandwiches, and I ate some of the better I've had in awhile there
I'm coming back and bringing people with me too; good value
This is nothing more than a tiny nondescript supermarket with a deli counter in the back but it's where I got the best peppered turkey and swiss cheese sandwich of my life! Everything was very fresh (boar's head meat, cheese, tomaotes, bread) and it was built thick and sturdy
If you need a quick, simple, yummy sandwich on the go stop in Schmoopie's
The Scene Mitchel London was former mayor Ed Koch's personal chef in a past life
Now he splits his time between his three shops--the other two are located inside Fairway and in Hell's Kitchen
This takeout spot does a bustling business, providing gourmet salads, sandwiches and baked goods to locals looking for something beyond Chinese delivery
The Food From grilled vegetables and tuna salad to heavenly croque monsieurs and quiches, the to-go menu features fresh, reliably delicious fare
Those looking to cater a party can browse the long menu of hors d'oeuvres: mini-hamburgers with sweet-and-sour relish, beef fillet on black bread with horseradish-mustard cream and buttermilk biscuits filled with ham, mustard and more
Holiday meals with all the trimmings are offered with a week's advance notice
Among pastries, the free-form seasonal tarts are excellent
The mini-cupcakes owe their loyal following to the fudge-like chocolate frosting
After giving this establishment more than one try to redeem itself, I've finally given up
Although the location may be handy, the mediocre overpriced food, disinterested service and 'uptown' staff is just not worth it
They are unorganized and unprofessional
The food is average and the staff is extremely slow and Mitchell London is so rude when he is there
I pick up my lunch there sometimes but only because there aren't that many options in the neighborhood
After walking by this crowded lunch spot, I wandered in for take out!  Genuinely interested chef/cook greeted me at the counter
Very knowledgeable about the offerings and the ingredients

I recommend the Chopstick Salad (soba noodles are yum) and the Chicken Cutlet Dinner
You can request stuff without meat and substitute with tofu
I can't stay away from this place
I'm completely addicted to their soy patties, hijiki patties, carrot dressing, and spinach salads
Plus, if you order sides, you can leave stuffed for under $5
But beware of cold/stale homefries, I still always order them, but it's a gamble
I've been there a few times and I love it
It's a greay place for wanting a full meal without killing the little money you have,
If there were on restaurant that I HAD to go to everyday it would have to be Dojo
They are health/Vegetarian conscious, there is fast service, and the food is delicious
On top of it all, it is very cheap!! Go Dojo!
The food here is good and cheap- you can get a meal for well under 10 dollars, and there's something to please vegetarians and meat eaters alike
Service is pretty mediocre at best, but the price can't be beat
I am moving from Texas to New York next month and I am counting down the days until I can eat at Dojo's again
I literally dream of the chicken cutlet on olive bread with Japanese barbecue sauce (which will cost you less than ten bucks with fries and a drink if the prices haven't changed)
Dojo's is great!
The Scene A young(ish), moneyed crowd fills this 500-capacity converted bank every night; it's also a popular business lunch spot
There are three different dining areas: a busy ground floor with an oyster bar and outdoor seating, a mezzanine and a low-lit jazz room in the basement
Be prepared to wait for your table at peak hours, even if you have a reservation
The Food Appetizers outshine entrees: Lobster and shrimp spring rolls crackle with freshness, octopus has a nice grilled touch and maki rolls are both inventive--incorporating BBQ eel, filet mignon and snow crabs--and delicious
Among entrees, Chilean sea bass stands out
Most main courses, however, are no more than adequate: Sauteed lobster, scallops and vegetables fail to coalesce; crab cakes are stodgy; mahi mahi is overwhelmed by a pinot noir sauce
Chocolate fondue is the pick of the desserts, and the wine list is varied and reasonably priced
as a local, i decided to give this place one more chance and have concluded that, in short, this place is a tourist trap and BT-ville
the bar staff is aloof and unfriendly
the food is expensive for what you get, and not all that interesting
the signature blue water salad is wilted iceberg lettuce with canned black olives and chick peas and boxed croutons -- and barely edible
the lobster sandwhich is a whopping $22 and you essentially get a heaping mound of cucumbers and avocado, strategically placed under a TEASPOON of lobster, so as to make the lobster look more plentiful
the best part of the meal was the homemade potato chips
don't bother with this place -- there are plenty of other seafood joints where you'll get pristinely fresh seafood for half the price
GET APPETIZERS
the rock shrimp in lettuce was good, and so were anything on their oyster bar--everything was thoroughly clean, no sand or grittiness at all
Ambience was nice, service was slow but polite
Entrees were above average (the boyfriend loved it, i thought it was just okay)
All in all, I think appetizers were a lot better than the entrees
OH, ps-we were seated in the main floor so no complaints about noise, but I heard downstairs in the jazz room is real loud so unless youre a fan of jazz, request for the main floor when youre making reservations
I went with three friends to Blue Water Grill and ate in the Jazz Room
Beware: if you want to be able to HEAR the person next to you speak, DO NOT EAT IN THE JAZZ ROOM!!!! The ambience was fine, but we were screaming across the table at each other
Appetizer was an array of shellfish which we found okay but not particularly impressive
The lobster roll was fantastic as was the lobster bisque
I ordered the Wild Atlantic salmon with a mustard viniagrette and asparagus salad - delicious! All entrees came in surprisingly large portions and everyone was more than satiated
Dessert was generously served as well
I definitely would return, but will think twice about being seated in the Jazz Room!
I went here last night with 6 of my friends
I made a reservation for us at 8, and we still had to wait about 35 minutes because 'they didn't expect us to be that many people', and yes, I did make a reservation, once again
Finally when we got to sit down, I had to sit right next to the pianist (we were sitting in a jazz hall) and I felt like I could have bothered him if I sneezed or something
I couldn't hear anyone so I was screaming to people who were sitting right next to me
The waitress took about 20 minutes to bring us the menu
She came back 20 minutes after to take our order, and it took us 30 MINUTES to get our appetizer! We ordered it from the raw bar; some oysters, lobsters, mussels and more and I can't understand why that raw plate had to take 35 minutes since they're
raw! Anyways, they were clean and fresh
We liked it
We also waited about another 30 minutes for our entree
6 Lobster dishes, 1 salmon dish and 1 sea bass dish; the food was okay
I have never paid so much at a dinner in my life but we also got very nice 3 bottles of wine
So I guess that was fine
I recommend this restaurant for a romantic spot but not to pig out like we did! Good scenery, decent food but Not-so-good Service!
My husband and I visit New York once a year for our anniversary
We choose Blue Water Grill for two of our trips
The food is excellent (especially the dumpling appetizer), the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great
While visiting last year we saw Susan Sharandon and Tim Robbins dinning
It was a great New York dinning expereince and would highly recommend
Very romantic
I went here tonight for my birthday dinner and I loved it
My date and I were seated in the Jazz room the moment we arrived (despite being arriving a half hour earlier than our reservation)
The room was a little bit noisy, but not to the point where you couldn't hear your date
We started off with the calamari, which was a little salty, but still tasty
For entrees he had the Surf n' Turf which was delicious, and I had the Sea Bass
The portions were huge for both dishes, and they both tasted amazing
For dessert we had the chocolate fondue, which was also spectacular
I would definitely recommend going back here for any seafood lover! The only downside was the service was a little on the slow side
The service and ambience is excellent at this restaurant which specializes in seafood
Just go for the seafood everything alse on the menu is below average and overpriced
We were made to wait 20 minutes for our table, finally got a table right by the band, I mean right in front of the band, don't know why they have tables so close to the band, in any case, requested a change of table, so had to wait another 15 mintues
After being seated took our waiter 10 mintues to get us a menu, 15 minutes to come back for our order, by the time we finally got our food it was almost 1 1/2 hour since getting there
The food, I have to say was very good, but service not so good, can't decide if it was worth the wait, probally give it another shot
I've never really been a fan of large, american-style, expensive restaurants
However, Blue Water Grill is a place where I will make a definate exception
Blue Water Grill has some of the BEST seafood entrees I have ever had
While dining I had the crab-crusted red snapple which was to die for
My dining companions had the surf turf and sea bass, both of which were almost as good as my snapper
Desserts were equally good
The ice cream roll, fondue and cheesecake were all delicious
Pair all the great food with great service, and beautiful architecture, it's no wonder this place is ALWAYS busy
Well we went there last week with 4 people
Had reservations only had to wait 15 mins on a saturday night
Has sat in the Jazz Room, pretty noisy, but it was fun! Everybody ordered something different, fillet, snapper, shrimp, scallops
Got a bottle of wine and apps
Rolls where a little small, over all got out of there for $200 plus tip for a group of 4
Waiter was a little slow I think she was somewhat new! Anyway pretty darn good!!!
The food was decent
The service was sub par
especially for a B
R
restaurant
I've been accustomed by the restaurant group's great service, so I was disappointed by the long wait for my lunch
The waiter was apologetic on the wait, and comped us a round of beverages
My table was in the main dining room, but seemed to be a high traffic area for the bus people
The restaurant is busy but the high traffic area in the main dining room detracts from the overall experience
you will love the seafood especially the RAW APPITIZER, I love the dessert too :)
I had a small family party at Blue Water Grill one week before Christmas
